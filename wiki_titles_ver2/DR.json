        "text": "The (JPBA) is the major sanctioning body for the sport of professional ten-pin bowling in Japan. The organization was founded by , and was established on January 27, 1967. The JPBA sanctions tournaments and other functions related to professional bowling for both men and women. Its headquarters are located in Tokyo. The current president of the JPBA is Hideki Matsuda.\nThe \"Japan Ladies Bowling Club\" is a sub-organization within the JPBA system, and sponsors women-only tournaments. The JLBC was co-founded by Ritsuko Nakayama and Kayoko Suda.\nPro test.\nProfessional bowling in Japan is a licensed profession, very much like passing the bar exam for attorneys or getting a CPA to become an accountant. To become a licensed bowling professional, the candidate must pass a series of skill exams, referred to as the \"pro test\".\nThe candidate needs to apply for the pro test. The application is available at the JPBA web site. Applicants must be 16 by the day before the 1st exam is held, and need two referrals from active (at least 30 games per year) pro bowlers who meet the average requirement of 190 (180 for women) and have been in the JPBA for at least five years. Once the application has been accepted and the 100,000¥ application fee is paid, the candidate will be assigned a number, and then added to the pro test schedule. The pro test is held simultaneously in two regions within Japan: west and east. The region is determined based on the candidate's home prefecture.\nThe pro test is held every April to May. The pro test is broken into three parts: 1st exam, 2nd exam, and 3rd exam. The 1st and 2nd exams are to test the candidate's bowling skills. Each of the two exams consist of four days at 15 games (12 games for women) per day. All candidates participate in the 1st exam, which is held locally in both the east and west. In the 1st exam, the candidate needs to maintain a 190 average (180 for women) for the first 30 games (24 games for women) to be allowed to continue to the third and fourth days. The candidate then needs to average a 200 (190 for women) for the first 60 games (48 games for women) in order to be allowed to continue to the 2nd exam. The 2nd exam takes place in both west and east Japan, which requires bowlers to travel. At the end of the 2nd exam, the candidate needs to maintain a 200 average for 120 games (96 games and a 190 average for women) in order to be allowed continue to the 3rd exam. Both exams move bowling alleys every day, meaning a successful candidate to the 3rd exam would have bowled in 8 different alleys.\nThe 3rd exam is a written exam and interview, where the candidate demonstrates bowling and procedure knowledge. The questions are scored, and the candidate needs to pass with a score of 60 or better.\nOnce all the exams are completed successfully, the candidate receives his bowling professional license. Entry into the association requires a ¥50,000 payment, while annual dues are ¥70,000.\nEmblem.\nAll licensed professionals belonging to the JPBA must wear the JPBA emblem on their bowling shirts when they make public appearances. The emblem is highly regarded in Japan as a symbol of professional bowling. The emblem has been used as props in Japanese television dramas such as \"Beautiful Challenger\" (1971) and \"Golden Bowl\" (2002).\nThe emblem displays the classification of a professional. There are two varieties of the emblem. All new members receive the General Class license patch (通常ワッペン) (see image above.) Before 2008, if a member has averaged 200 or better for 200 games in competition (190 or better for 200 games for women professionals) for five years in a row, he receives a gold-lined version of the insignia, referred to as the Class A permanent license patch (永久Ａ級ライセンスワッペン). From 2008, the average requirement was raised to 210 for men and 200 for women. In 2011, bowlers who are recognized as seeded (top 48 for men and top 18 for women in point ranking or through tournaments which guarantee a seed berth) for five years in a row may also become Class A. As of 2013, 97 men and 90 women are classified as Class A professionals.\nNotable JPBA members.\nAs of July 1, 2013, the JPBA membership is made up of 810 males and 309 females, as well as 11 teaching professionals.\nMale\nFemale"

He was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Batting side and throwing arm are unknown.\nSchulze was a major league player whose career, statistically speaking, was only slightly different from that of Eddie Gaedel or Moonlight Graham. On August 7, 1891, he debuted with the Browns and went hit-less in two at-bats. He did not have a fielding chance, and never appeared in a major league game again.\nSchulze died in his native St. Louis at the age of 75."

        "text": "The Army Black Knights men's lacrosse team represents the United States Military Academy (USMA, commonly known as \"West Point\") in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's lacrosse competition. During the team's 92-year history, it has won eight national championships and made fifteen postseason NCAA tournament appearances. The team currently holds the fifth-most wins of any team, with an all-time record of 705–332–7.\nHistory.\nThe first Army lacrosse game was played in 1907 against Stevens Tech. The Cadets won that season's only contest, 3–1. In 1909 and 1910, Army again fielded a lacrosse team, which mostly played local high school and club teams, but also a game each against Stevens Tech and Columbia. In those first three seasons, Army won all ten games it played. In 1921, lacrosse returned to West Point for good. After a 2–3 mark that season, the Cadets improved to 6–1 the following year, which was the start to a 33-year streak of winning seasons. In 1923, Army finished with an 8–1–1 record and was named the national championship team by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA).\nIn 1929, F. Morris Touchstone became the head coach. He remained in that post for 29 years and became Army's all-time winningest head coach in terms of wins with a record of 214–73–4 and winning percentage of 0.743. During this period, the lacrosse and football teams were closely connected and shared many personnel, as football players found the sport an excellent way to remain physically fit during the off-season. In both 1944 and 1945, Army won national championships in lacrosse and football.\nBill Carpenter, the \"Lonesome End\" and a future Distinguished Service Cross recipient, continued the tradition as both a football and lacrosse star. After Touchstone's death, James F. Adams took over as head coach in 1958, and in that first season, led the Cadets to their first perfect record since 1910 and the national championship. He stayed on for 12 years and compiled three more shared titles and a winning percentage of 0.777. In 1961, Adams was named the national Coach of the Year.\nAdams was replaced by Al Pisano. In 1971, the NCAA became the awarding authority for the lacrosse national championship and instituted the NCAA tournament. Army participated in each of the first three events. In the inaugural tournament, the Cadets routed Hofstra in order to advance to the final four, where Cornell edged them by one goal. Dick Edell replaced Pisano, and served for seven years before leaving to become Maryland's long-time coach.\nDuring the 1980s, Army appeared in six NCAA tournaments, including five consecutive ones starting in 1981. In 1984, Jack Emmer became head coach, and Army advanced to the final four, before being eliminated by Syracuse. The 1993 team finished with a 12–4 record, which included a defeat of Maryland in the first round of the NCAA tournament. In 1991, Army joined the Patriot League, and won its first 25 consecutive conference games, a league record. In 1999, the athletic teams, formerly known as the \"Cadets\", officially changed their name to the \"Black Knights\".\nArmy made three straight NCAA tournament appearances from 2003 to 2005. The following season, former assistant coach Joe Alberici returned to West Point to assume the head job. That year, the Black Knights finished as runners-up in the Patriot League and narrowly missed a tournament berth. In 2008, Army earned the conference regular season championship and Alberici was named the Patriot League Coach of the Year.\nHome stadium.\nArmy currently plays its home games at Michie Stadium, which is also the homefield of the football team and has an official capacity of 40,000. Prior to that, Army lacrosse used \"The Plain\" (the main parade ground), Clinton Field, Daly Field, and Shea Stadium.\nChampionships.\nFrom 1934 through 1970, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the NCAA Division I annual champion, based on regular-season records. Since 1971, the annual NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament has determined the top team in NCAA Division I lacrosse. Army has been awarded eight national championships, but none since the implementation of the NCAA tournament.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Army's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus."

Anderson played college baseball at the University of Minnesota from 1974 to 1975, until injuries ended his career. In 38 seasons (as of the end of the 2019 season), Anderson has led the Golden Gophers to a record of 1,317 wins, 887 losses and three ties. In the Big Ten he has led Golden Gophers to a record of 592 wins and 351 losses in that same span.\nPlaying career.\nAnderson graduated from Nashwauk-Keewatin High School in Nashwauk, Minnesota in 1973. Anderson would next enroll at the University of Minnesota, where he would walk-on to the Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball team. After pitching for two years, an arm injury forced Anderson to quit playing. He remained as a student coach for the next two years, and was even voted as MVP of the 1977 team.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing his graduation in 1977, longtime Gophers coach Dick Siebert named him a graduate assistant. Siebert died in the winter of 1978, and successor George Thomas named Anderson a full-time assistant. Thomas resigned in 1981, and Anderson became head coach at the age of 26–at the time, the youngest head baseball coach in Big Ten history. He has spent his entire adult life at the U of M as a player, assistant coach or head coach.\nHis most successful team was the 2018 unit, which reached the super regional round–the Gophers' deepest tournament run since their last College World Series appearance in 1977.\nAnderson announced in December 2023 that 2024 would be his last season coaching.\nHead coaching record.\nBelow is a table of Anderson's yearly records as an NCAA head baseball coach.\nPersonal.\nAnderson graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1977 with a B.S. in Education.

        "text": "James Francis Callahan (April 1, 1893 – May 25, 1961) was an American attorney who was president and minority owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National Hockey League.\nCareer.\nCallahan was legal adviser of the Pittsburgh Pirates hockey club under its original owner Henry Townsend. Callahan continued in that role when Townsend died and left the franchise to his sons Horace and Edward. In the fall of 1928, the Pirates were ostensibly sold to ex-lightweight boxing champion Benny Leonard, although the money for the purchase is suspected to have come from Bill Dwyer, owner of the New York Americans, who may have hid his involvement with the Pittsburgh club to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. At this point Callahan was made president of the Pirates. Callahan was also a minority stockholder.\nShortly after the Pirates moved to Philadelphia in 1930 to become the Philadelphia Quakers, Callahan became secretary and treasurer of the new Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League, which took over the franchise of the defunct Niagara Falls Cataracts."

The group's head Anand Mahindra tweeted that he had \"decided to support these passionate athletes\".\nMany of the members of the Indian national team, coordinated by the IHAI, are recruited from clubs associated with military units and regiments. The IHAI has created programs to introduce the sport to a wider audience, for example through the Learn to Play program that has been implemented in Ladakh, Kargil, Delhi, and Mumbai. As an alternative for players who do not have access to outdoor ice rinks, the association began holding programs in the in-line hockey, building on existing in-line hockey being played in Gujarat and Mumbai.\nIn 2015, the Ice Hockey Association of India sent the men's national team to Canada to play a game against the ECHL's Brampton Beast. On the team's trip through Canada in October 2015, the team will also play the CWHL's Calgary Inferno, according to Adam Sherlip, the only coach Team India has ever had."

        "title": "Rugby union in Pakistan",
        "text": "Rugby union in Pakistan is a minor but growing sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe Pakistan Rugby Union was formally established in 2000 and gained membership with the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2000. Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the IRB (International Rugby Board) in November 2003.\nRugby has now been introduced at the Provincial and District level by the Pakistan Rugby Union. Schools have also been targeted for rugby to be introduced at the grass root level.\nHistory.\nPakistani rugby goes as far back as 1926 when the Karachi Rugby Football Union was formed.\nThe game though remained mainly an expatriate sport, with KRFU being active on the All-India circuit up till the late fifties. Records of teams containing Pakistani players exist going back to the 1950s, with an East Pakistan Rifles team beating Chittagong Rugby Club on 2 July 1955 at Niaz Stadium. Chittagong was made up from European players, while the Rifles were all Pakistani apart from their coach J.M. Reay. The sixties saw a decrease in the expatriate population and travel to India becoming more regulated, therefore the club became more reliant on playing fixtures with visiting British Navy Ships, at a time when Karachi had become a regular port of call for R&amp;R and supplies. In 1968–1969 a handful of local players were introduced into the club: this would prove to be the saving grace for the game in the country. By the mid seventies the British Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean and port visits became infrequent, and by the early eighties Rugby had become almost non-existent. The Karachi Rugby Football Union continued to play, yet due to limited funds it was unable to travel abroad for matches and suffered from lack of opposing teams to play within the country.\nThe interest in rugby was rejuvenated in the nineties by the locals who had been introduced to the game in the seventies and by a resurgence in the expatriate presence. Whilst some experienced local players established clubs in Lahore and Karachi, staff from foreign embassies, commissions and banks, consisting of Frenchmen, British, and some Americans, established a club in Islamabad. 1992 onwards has seen regular fixtures between teams from these cities. By the mid-nineties an Islamabad club called the Islamabad Rugby Football Club, consisting mainly of local players had also been established in addition to the side made up of expatriates; the latter passes through phases of dormancy subject to postings and availability of players. Lahore Rugby Football Club which was formed around the same time became their main competitors. The three major clubs in Pakistan. Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi initiated an annual Pakistan 7s Championship on a rotating basis.\nNational team.\nThe national team is called Pakistan Rugby. It was first fielded in 2003, participating in the Provincial Tournament in Sri Lanka and there played the Indian National side as well. Pakistan currently takes part in the regional divisions of the Asian Five Nations."

The combined scores from these two jumps were used to calculate the deficit with which each athlete began the cross-country portion of the event. Each point behind the leading score of Georg Hettich was equivalent to four seconds of time deficit.\nCross-Country.\nThe start for the 15 kilometre race was staggered, with a one-point deficit in the ski jump portion resulting in a four second deficit in starting the cross-country course. This stagger meant that the first athlete across the finish line, Georg Hettich, was the overall winner of the event. \nSilver medallist Felix Gottwald of Austria and bronze medallist Magnus Moan of Norway both managed to beat Hettich by more than a minute in the cross-country leg, but with eleventh and ninth place respectively in the ski jumping leg, their cross-country skiing was not enough to take them to the very top of the podium. Moan beat compatriot Petter Tande in a dash for the finish line, while Finn Jaakko Tallus is a further second behind."

The game was played on July 13, 1965, at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota, home of the Minnesota Twins of the American League. The game resulted in a 6–5 victory for the NL.\nGame summary.\nTraditionally, the managers of the winning pennant baseball teams of the previous year would have managed their respective leagues. However, with the firing of 1964 Yankees manager Yogi Berra, and the resignation of '64 Cardinals manager Johnny Keane (who then managed the Yankees), the second place managers (Al López of the White Sox and Gene Mauch of the Phillies) would manage their respective teams. In the National League, there had been a tie for second place, but Reds manager Fred Hutchinson had died in November 1964, making it unnecessary to break the tie.\nAfter only five batters, the National League owned a 3–0 lead. Willie Mays hit a leadoff home run to left field off Milt Pappas, followed by a Willie Stargell single and a two-run Joe Torre homer.\nStargell's two-run homer in the second inning off Mudcat Grant made it 5–0. The NL was coasting until a four-run fifth inning against Jim Maloney, which included a pair of two-run homers by Dick McAuliffe and Harmon Killebrew, tying the game at 5-all.\nThe winning run scored in the seventh versus Sam McDowell on a walk to Mays, single by Hank Aaron, ground out by Roberto Clemente and infield hit by Ron Santo. Saving the game for the NL with two innings of relief was Bob Gibson, who, with Tony Oliva in scoring position after a ninth-inning double, struck out Killebrew and Joe Pepitone to end the game.\nAttendance was announced as 46,706.\nNL Starter Juan Marichal was named the game's MVP.\nNational League roster.\nThe National League roster included 13 future Hall of Famers.\nAmerican League roster.\nThe American League roster included 7 future Hall of Famers."

Sixteen national teams were competing in two venues, the Minsk-Arena and Chizhovka-Arena. It was the first time Belarus hosted the tournament. The selection of Belarus to host this competition was the subject of much debate, with some politicians in the European Union and North America calling for the IIHF to move the tournament to another country.\nRussia with a mix of NHL and KHL stars (unlike other nations, Russia comprised a squad close to their 2014 Olympic squad) remained undefeated throughout the championship. After losing on home-ice to Finland 1–3 earlier that year during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics Quarterfinals, the Russians rebounded by capturing the gold medal after defeating Finland 5–2 in the final. Sweden captured the bronze medal with a 3–0 victory over the Czech Republic. Host team Belarus made the playoffs for the first time since 2009, losing to Sweden 3–2 in the quarterfinal. Italy and Kazakhstan were relegated to Division I A. Prior to the championship, Divisions I to III had played their tournaments to establish the rank between teams of lower levels.\nThe tournament saw a new attendance record for the World Championship, as a total of 640,044 people attended games, surpassing the record set at the 2004 tournament in the Czech Republic, which had 552,097 spectators.\nHost selection.\nOn 8 May 2009 in Bern, Switzerland, the Belarusian bid was successful and got 75 votes in the race for hosting the 2014 IIHF World Championship. The application with the slogan \"Welcome to the young hockey country\" beat out those from Hungary (24 votes), Latvia (3), and Ukraine (3).\nThe two main venues listed as hosts for the ice hockey teams were Minsk-Arena (capacity around 15000) and Chizhovka-Arena (capacity around 9600). The larger arena was completed and opened in 2010, whereas the construction of the smaller one was completed in 2012.\nOn 16 January 2012, President Lukashenko announced that any foreigners who wanted to attend the World Championships would not need a visa to enter Belarus or the medical insurance required for entry. The only documentation required was an original or electronic copy of a ticket to a game.\nControversy.\nThe selection of Belarus as hosts caused great controversy and initiated the Minsk2014.No Campaign. On 11 April 2011, United States Senator Dick Durbin and Representative Michael Quigley urged the IIHF to move the World Championship to another location, citing concerns over the authoritarian government of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko's alleged human rights violations had resulted in numerous sanctions placed on himself and 157 of his associates by the European Union and the United States. Senator Durbin and Representative Quigley were supported by former Slovak ice hockey player and current Member of the European Parliament Peter Šťastný. According to a 2013 report by the U.S. organisation Freedom House, Belarus was the least democratic country in Europe at the time. The European Parliament called the IIHF to move the venue and demanded the release of all political prisoners as a condition to continue the Championship in Minsk. However, the IIHF remarked that its statutes did not allow it to discriminate on political grounds, and spokespersons for the Latvian and Lithuanian ice hockey federations stated that they had no desire for \"mixing politics with sports\".\nRosters.\nEach team's roster consists of at least 15 skaters (forwards and defencemen) and two goaltenders, and at most 22 skaters and three goaltenders. All 16 participating nations, through the confirmation of their respective national associations, have to submit a roster by the first IIHF directorate meeting.\nOfficials.\nThe IIHF selected 16 referees and 16 linesmen to work the 2014 IIHF World Championship. They were the following:\nFormat.\nOf the 16 teams in the tournament Belarus qualified as host while Kazakhstan and Italy qualified through the 2013 IIHF World Championship Division I, the rest qualified after a top 14 placement at the 2013 IIHF World Championship. The teams are divided into two groups of which the four best from each will advance to the quarter-finals. Here they will meet cross-over as indicated in the section below.\nIn the group round, points were awarded as follows:\nIf two or more teams finished with an equal number of points in the same group, their standings were determined by the following tiebreaking formula:\nFinal ranking: places 1–4 were determined by the medal games.

        "title": "Over-canvassed sailing",
        "text": "A sailing boat that is carrying too much sail for the current wind conditions is said to be over-canvassed. An over-canvassed boat, whether a dinghy, a yacht or a sailing ship, is difficult to steer and control and tends to heel or roll too much. If the wind continues to rise, an over-canvassed sailing boat will become dangerous and ultimately gear may break or it may round-up into the wind, broach or capsize. Any of these eventualities puts the safety of the crew and the vessel in danger. To over-canvass a sailing boat is considered unseamanlike and imprudent. In order to reduce sail, individual sails may be lowered or furled and existing sails may be reefed. Counter-intuitively, many boats will sail faster, and certainly more smoothly, comfortably and safely, when carrying the correct amount of sail in a strong wind than they would if over-canvassed and excessively rolling, heeling, carrying too much weather helm or repeatedly rounding up.\nDefinition.\nThe decision to reduce sail, to avoid being over-canvassed, is made at sea based on a number of factors. There are folklore sayings, such as, \"Any fool can set a sail, but it takes a sailor to take it down\" and, \"The best time to reef is when you first think about it; when you think it's time to shake it out, have a cup of tea first\".\nThe fact is, that the definition of being over-canvassed depends on a number of factors. These include the design, form and stability of the boat hull, the age and strength of the sails and gear, the direction of the wind relative to the course, the size, experience and state of the crew, the state of the sea as well as the purpose of the voyage.\nWarning signs that a well-found, well-crewed sailing vessel may be over-canvassed include excessive weather helm, excessive speed, any uncontrolled rounding up or broaching, excessive slamming into or falling off of waves, excessive heel or excessive rolling. If the purpose of the journey does not include racing, or if there is any kind of damage or minor emergency on-board, or if the boat is old or if the crew is ill, or tired or short-handed, then the meaning of 'excessive' may be reduced in any of these cases.\nSafety.\nThe most important reason to avoid being over-canvassed in a blow is the safety of the boat, its gear and its crew. Frank Mulville said that, \"With the wind fair a man is master of his boat and has the power to drive her as hard as he wishes – even to the point of destruction.\" He went on to say,\n\"In a contrary wind a well found yacht is master. She has more stamina to windward than any man by himself\". Von Haeften says that, \"It is impossible to tear working sails in good condition by wind pressure alone. If it happens, nevertheless, it will either be down to some sail-handling mistake so that the sail has been chafed or caught up somewhere, or to the fact that the sail was old and worn out\". There are many stories of gear breakage from a parted shackle leaving a sail to flap wildly to shrouds giving way to bring a mast down.\nA wildly heaving deck that is heeled, rolling or broaching beyond what is normally expected, can pitch a crew member overboard into the sea, or lead to a fall and subsequent injury. Such issues of crew safety are always paramount.\nComfort.\nA single- or short-handed crew must conserve energy and take even more care of personal safety when the boat is unlikely to be handled, or brought back for a rescue, in their absence or incapacitation. Reducing sail early and thoroughly may be more important in these cases, especially when far from land.\nFriends out for a sail or a cruise, rather than a race, will be more impressed by a comfortable, stable voyage than one in which the eager skipper's personal best for angle of heel is exceeded several times.\nSpeed.\nThe correct amount of sail for the conditions, with all that that implies will lead to improved boat performance compared to the over-canvassed state."

        "text": "Kyle Baseball Field was a baseball venue located in College Station, Texas, and was approximate to the football stadium, Kyle Field. The ballpark was installed at the same time as the football stadium in 1904; Texas A&amp;M were one of the original members of the Southwest Conference in 1914 but did not begin baseball until 1915.\nField conditions.\nAs compared to the more modern Olsen Field, Kyle Baseball Field gave birth to rocks because it was constructed on an ancient parking lot, and the rocks came up through the surface. Each day preceding practice, the team had to line up across the field and went from one end to the other, removing the rocks so the infielders wouldn't get injured in the face from bad hops.\nField contraction.\nThe ballpark had a grandstand finished in June 1923 which cost $7,500 at the time. With expansion to Kyle Field in 1929, 1954, and 1969, the baseball field, in contrast, kept shrinking. Due to the small capacity of the baseball field, the Aggies had to play the 1959 District 6 playoffs with the University of Arizona at Travis Field in nearby Bryan; the Aggies lost the two games in the double-elimination by identical 1–0 in front of 6,000. From 1972 to 1975, Texas A&amp;M had to make Travis Field their home away from \"home\" because the school representatives took Kyle Baseball Field from the baseball team during another series of augmentation of Kyle Field. The Texas A&amp;M Aggies played their last seasons at Kyle Baseball Field in 1976 and 1977. With the opening of UFCU Disch-Falk Field in Austin in 1975, the Aggies knew they had to construct a new facility in order to compete with their in-state rivals which led to Olsen Field in 1978.\nLegacy.\nThe Aggies won Southwest Conference titles in 1931, 1934, 1942, 1951 (co-champions with UT-Austin), 1955, 1959, and 1977 while calling Kyle Baseball Field their home."

        "title": "1957 NCAA University Division basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1957 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game took place on March 23, 1957, between the North Carolina Tar Heels and the Kansas Jayhawks at the Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. The matchup was the final one of the nineteenth edition of the single-elimination tournament now known as the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament—commonly referred to as the NCAA Tournament—organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). It was used to crown a national men's basketball champion in the NCAA's University Division, known since 1973 as the NCAA Division I.\nAfter surviving numerous close games during the regular season, the conference tournament, and lastly, a triple-overtime game against Michigan State in the national semifinal, North Carolina came into the national championship game with an unblemished record of 31–0. Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar Heels were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the national championship game with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on the Jayhawks' part. The Jayhawks, led by sophomore phenom and first-team All-American Wilt Chamberlain, were favored to win against the Tar Heels.\nThe game attracted heavy media attention with over ten television stations and sixty–three news reporters in attendance. The North Carolina Tar Heels jumped out to an early 19–7 lead in the first half until the Jayhawks reduced the Tar Heels' lead to seven points (29-22) at halftime. In the second half, the Jayhawks took the lead. The Tar Heels tied the game in the final minute, sending the game into overtime. In the first overtime, each team scored a basket before time ran out; in the second overtime, no points were scored due to lack of offensive execution by both teams. More action took place in the third overtime. The Tar Heels won the game 54–53 as Joe Quigg made two free throws in the closing seconds to give them their first NCAA Men's Basketball National Championship.\nThe team received a large welcome at Raleigh–Durham International Airport when they arrived back in North Carolina. Due to the successful televising of the national championship game in North Carolina, the broadcasting of Atlantic Coast Conference collegiate basketball games expanded greatly. Kansas' Chamberlain was criticized for his inability to win the national championship. He eventually left Kansas after his junior year to join the Harlem Globetrotters.\nBackground.\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nThe North Carolina Tar Heels were coached by Frank McGuire, who was in his fifth season as the team's head coach. His offensive philosophy centered around passing before shooting. McGuire's starting line up, and most of the roster, consisted primarily of players from New York state due to McGuire's connections in the area from his time as St. John's head coach. Carolina squads prior to McGuire usually had several in-state players and select out of state talent. Tommy Kearns and Pete Brennan were two offensive specialists. Center Joe Quigg provided a solid presence in the paint (free throw lane) and grabbed almost nine rebounds per game. Guard Bob Cunningham was one of the team's best defensive players. Lennie Rosenbluth, who averaged almost twenty-eight points a game and served as the team's clutch performer, led the team.\nNorth Carolina began their 1956–57 campaign with three straight wins by a wide margin of victory. In their fourth game, the Tar Heels traveled to Columbia, South Carolina, to play the South Carolina Gamecocks. They took the Tar Heels to overtime before North Carolina was able to come away with a four-point victory. Near the end of December, the Tar Heels participated in the annual Dixie Classic. They won it and remained undefeated after beating the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in the championship game. North Carolina then won five more games before going into double overtime against the Maryland Terrapins winning the game 65–61 to earn their seventeenth consecutive victory. In the following game, the Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina were tied with 73 points each before Tar Heel Kearns sank two free throws to give North Carolina a two-point lead before the game ended. The Tar Heels closed out the regular season with six more victories to finish with a record of 24–0. North Carolina won their quarterfinal match-up in the ACC tournament by twenty points to advance to the semifinals against Wake Forest. The Demon Deacons were leading 59–58 as the game entered the final minute. With time running out, Rosenbluth made a two-point shot but was fouled in the act of shooting, which sent him to the line to shoot a free throw; he made the free throw and the Tar Heels won 61–59. The Tar Heels then beat South Carolina in the championship to earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament.\nThe Tar Heels defeated the Yale Bulldogs 90–74 in the NCAA East Regional Quarterfinal to advance to the semifinal against Canisius College. North Carolina won the game by twelve points allowing them to move on to the NCAA East Regional Final against the Syracuse Orange. The final, and the semifinal, was held at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Syracuse Orange fell to the Tar Heels 67–58 allowing them to advance to the Final Four in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tar Heels' opponent for the national semifinal was the Michigan State Spartans. The Tar Heels were tied with the Spartans as regulation time was winding down. Michigan State's Jack Quiggle made a half court shot that would have given the Spartans the lead, but it left his hands after time expired, nullifying the basket. In the first overtime, Michigan State had a two-point lead with eleven seconds remaining and had a player at the foul line. The Spartan missed both shots. Carolina's Brennan gathered the rebound, dribbled down the court, and made a shot as time expired to send the game to a second overtime. The Tar Heels pulled away in the third overtime to win the game 74–70. The game saw the lead change thirty-one times before the Tar Heels were able to emerge victorious after three overtime periods.\nKansas Jayhawks.\nDick Harp was in the midst of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks when the team entered the national championship game. Kansas began the season favored to win the national title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man-to-man defense, but later switched to a zone defense to give the Jayhawks an advantage in rebounding the basketball.\nThe Jayhawks began the regular season with twelve consecutive victories before losing to the Iowa State Cyclones by two points having lost the lead in the closing seconds of the game. Kansas' next game was against Iowa State; this time, the Jayhawks won the game by a margin of nine points. The Jayhawks won their next four games before losing to the Oklahoma State Cowboys in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The shot clock was not in use in 1957 allowing the Cowboys to hold the ball for the final three and a half minutes and win the game 56–54. Both of the Jayhawks' regular season losses were due in part to their poor ball control. The Jayhawks' squad closed out the regular season with four more victories, finishing the regular season with a conference best 11–1 record, earning them the Big Seven Conference regular season crown and a berth in the NCAA Tournament.\nIn the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Jayhawks faced the Southern Methodist Mustangs and were forced into an overtime period. With 36 points from Chamberlain, the Jayhawks won 73–65 to advance to the regional finals. There, they defeated the Oklahoma City Stars 81–61 to reach the Final Four. Chamberlain posted 30 points in the contest, adding 15 rebounds. The two-time defending NCAA Tournament champions, the San Francisco Dons, faced Kansas at the Final Four's host site, Kansas City. With a field goal percentage of almost 60 percent, the Jayhawks posted an 80–56 win to advance to the championship game against undefeated North Carolina, the number one-ranked team in the country. Even though the Tar Heels were undefeated, and ranked number one in the nation, Kansas entered the game as a three-point favorite, mostly because playing in Kansas City—close to nearby Lawrence, the school's location—was virtually a home game.\nBroadcasting.\nThe national semifinal between Kansas and San Francisco was not televised, while the North Carolina-Michigan State Spartans match-up was broadcast in some areas. Plans to televise the national championship game were made in advance in anticipation that the Kansas Jayhawks would reach the championship game. By the time the match-up was set between the Jayhawks and the Tar Heels, an eleven-station network had been organized. Castleman D. Chesley, a local television producer, broadcast the game in North Carolina on five stations. After the Tar Heels won the Eastern Regional, Chesley managed to get announcers, sponsors and five stations to set up a network to broadcast North Carolina's Final Four games from Kansas City. Locally, the game was to appear on channels 9 and 13. The 1957 national championship game saw the largest media crowd to date for a men's basketball game. Over eleven television stations, 73 radio stations, and 63 news writers were represented.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nThe game began with a tip-off between Kansas' seven foot tall Chamberlain and North Carolina's Kearns, who was not even six feet tall. Coach McGuire used Kearns after he had talked down Chamberlain the night before. The rest of the North Carolina squad set up in their zone defense rather than around the center circle as McGuire requested to \"show them the zone we were going to use.\" The Jayhawks were unable to score on their opening possession and set up in their defense as the Tar Heels came down the court with the ball. Kansas' initial defense was a box-and-one, which consisted of four players in a box around a basket while one player, King, played defense on North Carolina's Rosenbluth. Kearns received a pass along the baseline and was fouled in the act of shooting. He missed the shot, but made both free throws to give Carolina the early 2–0 lead. Kansas missed a jump shot, and North Carolina's Joe Quigg converted a 12-foot baseline shot. Kansas scored their first points from two free throws.\nThe Tar Heels' began to strain Kansas' defense with several players making perimeter shots. When combined with Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels to jump out to an 11–4 lead. This led Harp to change Kansas' defensive formation to a 2–3 zone defense, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth—who was now relatively unguarded compared to Kansas' previous formation—made a contested seventeen-foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled as he went up for a shot. He went to the free-throw line and made one of two shots. As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original box–and–one. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 15–7 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then fouled in the air. He went to the line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught the rebound.\nDuring the following possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a man-to-man. This caused the Tar Heels to become more active with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off-the-ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free-throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King taking an eight-foot shot. Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half-court as Kansas shifted back into a 2–3 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a man-to-man again. Kearns made a close-quarters shot near the basket. Kansas stepped up their defense at the behest of coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During that time Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points—the score now 19–17. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams both scored two free throws to bring the score to 29–22 in favor of North Carolina.\nSecond half.\nThe second half began with another jump ball between the two competing teams. Chamberlain won the tip as Carolina sent out Quigg this time to contest the jump, not Kearns. Both teams failed to score on their first possession, but after Carolina missed their opening shot, Kansas scored on a fast-break pull-up shot. Kansas scored once more—from a lob to Chamberlain—before the Tar Heels were able to score with a baseline jump shot from Quigg to bring the score to 31–26. Kansas closed the lead to 31–30 with a basket and a pair of free throws from Chamberlain. Carolina's Kearns returned with an acrobatic layup to extend the lead to three points.\nAfter Kansas failed to convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina proceeded to pass the ball around the perimeter of the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 10–2 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Harp had his team hold the ball beginning with their next possession. This plan worked for a while and Carolina was unable to overcome Kansas' three-point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.\nWith 1:45 remaining in the game, Kansas' Elstun was fouled by Rosenbluth on a lay-up attempt. This was Rosenbluth's fifth foul, which disqualified him for the rest of the game. Elstun missed the two free throws from the foul, and Carolina got the rebound. The Jayhawks were able to score only two points after Rosenbluth's disqualification. North Carolina then began to rally after scoring a basket and then an accompanying free throw. Bob Young—who had replaced Rosenbluth after his fifth foul—scored a lay-up bringing Carolina to within two points. Carolina tied the game at 46–46 after Kearns made a free throw in the closing seconds. The Tar Heels got the ball back and held it for one final possession. The ball was passed to Cunningham who missed his initial shot, but was able to get the rebound. Cunningham went up for another shot, but received heavy contact from Chamberlain. No foul was called and the time ran out, sending the game to overtime.\nOvertime periods.\nOvertime began with a jump ball won by Chamberlain for Kansas. He quickly passed the ball to King who took a jump shot that missed. Carolina's Cunningham grabbed the rebound. The Tar Heels traversed the court and Young managed to score a basket to give Carolina the edge. However, North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing drive as Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 48–48. After Kansas scored the tying basket, North Carolina proceeded to hold the ball for one final shot before the overtime period ended. Carolina's Kearns drove and put up a shot that was blocked by Chamberlain as time ran out.\nNorth Carolina's first possession of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over him to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw the ball out of bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one-and-one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the teams, resulting in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion, and Chamberlain was sent to the free-throw line. He missed both shots, and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final, shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go. Then the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot, and the game remained tied at 48.\nAfter a one-minute break between periods, the third overtime began with another jump ball again won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening shot of the period, Carolina's Kearns made a right-handed lay-up to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled; he then made both free throws. Off a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 52–52.\nOn the next possession, Kansas' John Parker stole the ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain received the ball in the post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. On the next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the foul line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining; he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pump-faked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while he was shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free-throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, giving the Tar Heels the lead 54–53. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was underthrown, and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed it and got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the national championship.\nBox score.\nSource:\nAftermath.\nDespite his team losing the championship game, Kansas' Chamberlain was named the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player. He was also named to the Consensus All-American squad for the 1956–57 season. North Carolina's Rosenbluth was named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year for his performance throughout the basketball season, as well as a Consensus All-American. The Tar Heels' coach McGuire was named UPI College Basketball Coach of the Year for leading North Carolina to a win in the National Championship game and a perfect record of 32–0.\nWhile coach McGuire and Rosenbluth boarded a plane to New York to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", the rest of the Tar Heels returned to North Carolina two days later where they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). Over 10,000 fans greeted the North Carolina squad. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. It was so big it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The size of the crowd at the airport was credited to the broadcast of both the national semifinal and National Championship games on television around North Carolina.\nIn Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Tar Heel fans who had watched the game on television flooded Franklin Street after the victory over the Jayhawks. Over two thousand people rushed the street preventing cars from passing for over an hour. Police were required to help maintain order. This has since turned into a tradition where people overrun Franklin Street following a Tar Heel win over the Duke Blue Devils or whenever they have won a National Championship.\nChamberlain was criticized for his inability to lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; He later admitted this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under coach Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which consisted primarily of double- or triple-teaming him to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out the time on the clock when they had the lead over the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game. After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.\nThe 1957 North Carolina players were awarded watches for their part in the winning the national championship. (In the 1990s, the players were given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game at the insistence of then-North Carolina coach Dean Smith.) Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university and signed a new five-year contract worth $11,500 per year. After seeing the success of televising the tournament's final games, Castleman Chesley believed, \"ACC basketball could be as popular as any TV show in North Carolina.\" The broadcast of North Carolina's national semifinal and National Championship games led to increased awareness and attention towards basketball around the state. It also led to Chesley and the Atlantic Coast Conference agreeing to a television contract whereby he would broadcast twelve ACC games league-wide during the 1957–58 season. The games aired on Saturdays the following season were called the \"ACC Game of the Week\". The television contract allowed the league to expand and increase the conference's visibility. It also led to an increase in ticket sales for the members of the ACC. More children began to pick up the sport of basketball as a result of the increase in the number of ACC games being televised."

        "text": "John Wilkinson Birch (1878 – 10 October 1953) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s and 1900s. He played at representative level for Great Britain and England, and at club level for Leeds Parish Church and Leeds, as a forward.\nBirch was born on 1 June 1878 and baptised on Christmas Day 1878 at St Mary's church Garforth, Leeds. His father was George Birch of Barrowby Lane who was a very large man weighing around 24 stone and also a very well known character of Garforth known to the villagers as Scribbin Birch, His mother was Alice Ellen Smith of Garforth he married Annie Simpson of Kippax in 1898.\nPlaying career.\nBirch played for the Leeds Parish church rugby team he was in the team when they played their last ever match on Wednesday 24 April 1901 Scoring a Try against York with the result going in favour of the Parish Church 21–2 the club was disbanded when the lease on its Clarence Road ground expired When Leeds Parish Church disbanded in 1901 the Church Committee generously placed the whole of their playing staff at the disposal of the Leeds Club who welcomed John Wilkinson Birch and seven of his colleagues; W. Cororan, C. Crumpton, W. Evans, S. Herberts, G. Hewlett, J. McNicholas, and George Mosley. These players did more than merely join the Leeds club, they gave to it all their loyalty, skill and spirit. John Wilkinson Birch made his début against Wakefield Trinity at Headingley on 7 September 1901 running out winners 16–9, many Leeds followers think that strength of the side of these days was greater than anything there has been at Headingley since, and there are many good judges who firmly believe that this 1906 team was the best that ever wore the Leeds jersey; Young, Jenkins, T. Llewellyn, Thomas, Hughes, Ward, Brayshaw, Hewlett, Stead, Lunn, Watts, Webster, Wainwright, Wormald, John Wilkinson Birch. It may be that the passage of time lends enchantment, but it is certainly no exaggeration to say that many of the players in that team are still revered at Headingley today.\nInternational honours.\nJohn Wilkinson Birch won a cap for England while at Leeds in 1908 against Wales, and won a cap for Great Britain while at Leeds in 1908 against New Zealand.\nLeeds v The Rest 1902.\nWhen Leeds won the Yorkshire Senior Competition in 1901/02 Leeds proved themselves true Champions with victory over The Rest a team made up of the best players from rival clubs the result been 7–5 on 19 April 1902 at Headingley.

Holder.\nRetirement.\nBirch retired in 1909. His final game was against Hunslet in the 2nd round of the Northern Union Cup. He broke his collarbone within the first 10 minutes of the cup tie but with rare pluck kept on playing as the Yorkshire Evening Post states (20 March 1909). The match was played in front of 22,000 thousand spectators and Hunslet opted to play there biggest six forwards leaving out Smales and Davies and the result justified this selection, The Leeds front rank being entirely worn down by the \"Terrible Six\" before the end of the game. The result been Hunslet 15 Leeds 9. The Leeds team that day was; F. Young, G. Desborough, F. Oliver, F. Ware, W. Goldthorpe, J. Fawcett, R. Ward, R. Jones, F. Webster, F. Harrison, S. Whitaker, J.

While representing Neath, Hutchinson was selected to represent Wales as part of the 1894 Home Nations Championship, facing Ireland away in Belfast. Hutchinson was one of three new caps to come into the Welsh squad, with Jack Elliott at three-quarters and David Nicholl joining Hutchinson in the pack. Although Wales had been beaten heavily by England in the opening game of the tournament, a morale-boosting win over Scotland had lifted Welsh hopes of a victory over Ireland. The match was played on a boggy pitch at Ballynafeigh, with the Irish winning by a single penalty goal.\nHutchinson was not re-selected for the next season, with the reintroduction of Charles Nicholl, who Hutchinson had himself covered during the 1894 Ireland encounter. The opening game of the 1896 Home Nations Championship saw Wales suffer a terrible seven try to nil defeat away to England. This forced the Welsh selectors to make massive changes to the Welsh pack, which contained several veteran Welsh forwards of the 1893 Triple Crown winning side. Five new caps were brought into the team for the second match of the Championship, with Hutchinson regaining his place as one of only three returning players in the pack. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, the Welsh beat Scotland 6–0 at the Cardiff Arms Park, and Hutchinson was brought back for the final game of the series away to Ireland. Again the Welsh struggled in Ireland losing 4–8. Hutchinson was replaced the next season by Fred Cornish and did not represent Wales again.\nIn 1894, Hutchinson was a member of the Glamorgan County team that faced Devonshire.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "John Thomas Riley (June 14, 1919 – July 13, 2016) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and executive. He was the first general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League. He served the Penguins from their founding through the spring of 1970, and then in a second term from January 1972 to January 1974. In 1975, he became Commissioner of the Southern Hockey League. From 1979 to 1983 he served as President of the International Hockey League.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nRiley was born in Toronto, Ontario. As a teenager he began an 11-year playing career, mostly in the Eastern Hockey League and the American Hockey League. Riley played for the Baltimore Orioles, Baltimore Clippers, Philadelphia Falcons, Hershey Bears, Washington Lions, and Tulsa Oilers during his career. After retiring as a player in 1950, he became the Lions' head coach and remained with the team until 1953. In 1959, he became general manager of the American Hockey League's Rochester Americans. He served in that capacity until 1964, and was president of the AHL until 1966 before accepting a general manager position with one of the National Hockey League's new expansion teams.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nWhen the NHL decided to expand in 1967. Riley had offers to be general manager from the Pittsburgh Penguins, St. Louis Blues and the Philadelphia Flyers. Riley decided on Pittsburgh, because of its proximity to his family in Toronto, and was hired by the Penguins' owner Jack McGregor, who also served as the team's president and CEO.\nAs the Penguins' general manager, Riley helped pick the team's nickname and the team's uniform colors, which were Columbia blue, navy blue and white. He then hired George \"Red\" Sullivan as the team's first coach. During the 1967 Expansion Draft, the NHL made it hard for the new clubs, by limiting the number of quality players the established Original Six teams could leave unprotected in the expansion draft. The league also placed the two developmental teams controlled by each of the established teams off-limits. The expansion teams would have to depend mainly on free agents signed by Riley from the Pittsburgh Hornets, who were the defending AHL champions. Riley signed the Penguins' first player Les Binkley, who would play for the Penguins for parts of five seasons. Former New York Rangers star Andy Bathgate, who would lead the West Division in scoring at age 34 was selected late in the draft by Jack McGregor. The Penguins payroll in their first season was $350,000.\nUnder Riley, the Penguins finished fifth in the league their first 2 seasons. In their third year, the Penguins placed second in the West Division and beat the Oakland Seals, 4-0, in the first round of the playoffs before losing to St. Louis in six games in the league semifinals. In the third round of the 1969 NHL Draft, Riley selected forward Michel Briere. Briere had a successful rookie season and looked to be a player that the Penguins could be built around. He was critically injured in a car crash in Quebec a few weeks after the season, however, and remained in a coma for 11 months before he died. He was 21. During those 11 months, Riley was a frequent visitor of his at the hospital.\nPost hockey.\nIn January 1974, Riley was replaced as the club's general manager by his assistant, Jack Button. He remained with the team, helping as a scout. Decades later, he worked as a replay judge during Penguins' games at Mellon Arena and as a consultant to the IHL and AHL into his 80s.\nRiley was an active member of the Penguins' Alumni Association. In 2000, Riley was elected to the Pittsburgh Penguins' Hall of Fame. He was in attendance as the \"Honorary GM\" at 2011 NHL Winter Classic Alumni Game at Heinz Field between alumni of the Penguins and Washington Capitals. Riley lived in South Hills with his daughter, Barbara, since his wife died in 1988. He jogged daily from his 30s into his 70s. He maintained a friendship with fellow former-Penguins' general manager Eddie Johnston and still attended Penguins' games into his 90s. The locker room at the Penguins' current arena, Consol Energy Center, contains a mural in the team's locker room which features Riley for his contribution to the franchise.\nRiley died on July 13, 2016, in Scott Township (just outside of Pittsburgh) at the age of 97. His death occurred less than a month after the Penguins' franchise, that he had helped build, won its fourth Stanley Cup title. In a press release the Penguins stated that \"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Jack Riley.\" The Penguins added that the organization was \"built on the shoulders of hard-working people like Jack, and the loss hits home as the team’s 50th anniversary is set to be celebrated during the upcoming campaign.\""

        "title": "Third Test, 1932–33 Ashes series",
        "text": "The Third Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series was one of five Tests in a cricket series between Australia and England. The match was played at the Adelaide Oval in Adelaide from 13 to 19 January 1933, with a rest day on 15 January. England won the match by 338 runs to take a series lead of 2 Tests to 1 with 2 Tests to play.\nThe Test was noted as the one in which the controversy over the use of \"bodyline\" tactics by the English team came to a head. These tactics, employed by the England fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce on the direction of their captain, Douglas Jardine, engendered much ill-feeling.\nBackground.\nIn 1932–33, the English team led by Douglas Jardine toured Australia and won the Ashes in a highly acrimonious series known as the \"bodyline series\". It has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities.\nThe English team used controversial bowling tactics where the English fast bowlers Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the cricket ball roughly on the line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short pitched, bouncing as high as the head and torso of the batsman, with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat. The tactics were difficult for batsmen to counter. The only options for a batsman were to duck, carrying the risk of being hit on pitches with irregular bounce, or to play the ball. However, defensive shots risked a catch in the cordon, while hooking carried the danger of being hit in the head at dangerous speeds. The bowling was designed to be intimidatory, causing controversy and ill-feeling among the Australian players and crowds. The primary target of bodyline was Donald Bradman who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, Bradman had scored a world record 974 Test runs during that series, a feat which remains unsurpassed. English cricket commentators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932–33 and looked for weaknesses.\nOn the journey to Australia, Jardine discussed tactics with Larwood and other bowlers, and he may have met senior batsmen Wally Hammond and Herbert Sutcliffe. Some players reported that Jardine told them to hate the Australians to defeat them, while instructing them to refer to Bradman as \"the little bastard.\" At this stage, he seems to have settled on leg theory, if not full bodyline, as his main tactic. While Jardine's unfriendly approach and superior manner caused some friction with the press and spectators, the early tour matches were uncontroversial and Larwood and Voce had a light workload in preparation for the Test series. This changed in the match against an Australian XI where the bowlers first used bodyline tactics. Under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt, Jardine having rested from the match, the England attack bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed that this was not pre-planned and he simply passed on to Jardine what happened after the match. The bodyline tactics continued in the next match and several players were hit. The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Former players joined the criticism by saying that the tactics were ethically wrong. However, at this stage, not everyone was opposed. The Australian Board of Control believed the English bowlers had not bowled unfairly when Bradman expressed his concern to them. Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Plum Warner over bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner opposed bodyline but would not speak out against it. However, he was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments at the start of the tour that cricket \"has become a synonym for all that is true and honest. To say 'that is not cricket' implies something underhand, something not in keeping with the best ideals ... all who love it as players, as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm.\" Furthermore, he had criticised bowler Bill Bowes for using short-pitched bowling against Jack Hobbs in a match at the end of the 1932 season.\nEarlier tests.\nJardine's tactics were successful in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman had scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him. He missed the first Test, worn out by constant cricket and the ongoing argument. Australia lost heavily by ten wickets as Larwood took ten wickets, as the English bowlers used bodyline intermittently, to the crowd's vocal displeasure. The only Australian batsman to make an impact was Stan McCabe, who hooked and pulled everything aimed at his upper body, undeterred by the prospect of taking a potentially lethal blow to the head. He scored 187 not out in four hours, an innings described by leading historian David Frith as \"among the most stirring innings Test cricket has ever produced\". Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling. For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline tactics. Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings, bowled by Bowes. Jardine was observed to be so delighted that he clasped his hands above his head and performed a \"war dance\". This was an extremely unusual reaction in the 1930s, particularly from Jardine who rarely showed any emotion while playing cricket. However, in the second innings, against the full bodyline attack, Bradman scored an unbeaten century, his only one of the series, which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each.\nThe victory was met by widespread public jubilation, as many believed that Australia had found a means of overcoming the tactics. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. On the other hand, the pitch was slightly slower than was customary throughout the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.\nWoodfull's approach.\nMeanwhile, Bill Woodfull's physical courage, stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit— according to Ken Piesse, 34 times in all. Woodfull, was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack. However, the Australian captain refused to consider doing so. Before the Second Test in Melbourne, he had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors, causing the toss to be delayed and leading to speculation that the Australian Board of Control wanted to remove Woodfull because of his refusal to allow his bowlers to retaliate. His deputy Victor Richardson advocated retaliation along with several other players. Richardson recalled Woodfull's private response: \"There is no way I will be influenced to adopt such tactics which bring such discredit to the game. I know Tim could do it but I am not going to participate in actions that can only hurt the game.\"\nThe media advocated the selection of Eddie Gilbert, an indigenous bowler of extreme pace, in order to return the bodyline barrage. In one tour match, Gilbert had bloodied Jardine and left a bruise the size of a saucer. Another suggested means of retaliation was Laurie Nash, a footballer and paceman whose notoriously abrasive personality and aggression saw him regarded as a thug. However, Woodfull was totally unmoved by such suggestions.\nTeam selection.\nIn the buildup to the third Test, Jardine banned spectators from watching his players at net practice after he had been barracked. The press were unable to watch and therefore give detailed previews before the match started. The tourists' preparations were also hampered by stories in the press that Maurice Tate and Jardine had come to blows, which Tate later denied was true or even realistic. There were questions over the form of Jardine, who had scored just 28 runs in his three innings in the series, Jardine suggested that he should stand down from the team. The rest of the tour selection committee, Wally Hammond, Bob Wyatt, Herbert Sutcliffe and Warner would not consider dropping the captain. However, taking into account Jardine's nervousness before going in to bat, the senior players persuaded Jardine to open the batting with Sutcliffe. Sutcliffe and Jardine had occasionally opened together on the 1928–29 tour with some success.\nThe English selectors were concerned by the domination of the Australian spinners of Bill O'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger, who had reduced the tourists to strokelessness in the second Test. To counter this, Eddie Paynter was introduced into the side in the hope that his aggressive style and left-handed batting (in contrast to the rest of the batting line-up which was right-handed) would disrupt the Australian bowlers. He replaced the Nawab of Pataudi whose earlier successes, including a century on his Test match debut, were offset by his slow scoring. However, Pataudi's refusal to field close on the leg-side in the bodyline field setting, his friendliness with the opposition and the mutual antipathy between him and Jardine may also have contributed to the loss of his place. England made one other change. Although Bowes had dismissed Bradman in the second Test, he took no other wickets; Jardine believed that the Adelaide pitch was not helpful to fast bowlers, while spinner Jack White had taken thirteen wickets in the equivalent match four years previously. Consequently, Hedley Verity replaced Bowes in the team. Australia made just one change to the team which won the second Test. Leo O'Brien, who had scored 10 and 11 in that match, was relegated to twelfth man and Bill Ponsford returned to the side.\n13 January: Day One.\nJardine won the toss and chose to bat. Clem Hill remarked to Jardine that it should be a close game, but Jardine joked that he obviously had not seen who had won the toss. There had been rain on the day before the match and moisture was still present when Sutcliffe and Jardine went out to bat, which made the pitch difficult for batting that morning. Australia had played three spinners, so leg spinner O'Reilly took the new ball with the solitary paceman Tim Wall. The fourth ball, from Wall, bounced unexpectedly and hit Sutcliffe's shoulder, to the crowd's pleasure. After twenty minutes play, England had scored just four runs when Jardine was bowled off his pads trying to glance a swinging delivery from Wall. Hammond came in and looked uncomfortable as Wall bowled some short-pitched deliveries. He had to duck underneath one ball and departed after slashing wildly at a quick delivery and with the score at 16, he was caught by Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, standing further back than usual, diving across in front of first slip. Umpire George Hele believed Hammond may have deliberately got out. Jardine believed the ball had bounced lower than usual. As he walked off, disturbed by the frequency of short bowling, Hammond was heard to say \"If that's what the bloody game's coming to, I've had enough of it.\" A second wicket fell without a run added as Sutcliffe, after 46 minutes batting, played a weak shot and hit O'Reilly in the air. Wall, at short square leg, dived forward to take a one-handed catch. Les Ames, who was in poor batting form, also looked uncomfortable. He batted unconvincingly for 39 minutes for three runs and did not score for 20 minutes; in that time, he edged the ball several times and was bowled by a no-ball from O'Reilly. Just as it appeared he was settling down, he was bowled by a faster ball from left arm orthodox spinner Bert Ironmonger. England's score was four wickets for 30 runs (4/30). The crowd were delighted by the course of the morning session; England had not expected to lose so many wickets so quickly and Hedley Verity and Gubby Allen, both due to bat lower in the order, were seen rushing to the dressing room to change in case they were needed to bat quickly. Maurice Leyland and Bob Wyatt took England to lunch without losing any more wickets and the score was 4/37 after 90 minutes play.\nLeyland and Wyatt began a recovery after the interval, batting beyond tea in putting on a 156-run partnership and turning the match back towards England. During this stand, the pitch settled down and became easy to bat on as the moisture in the pitch dried out. Leyland began with a hooked four from Wall and began advancing down the pitch to Clarrie Grimmett. Jardine had told the pair to bat cautiously, but Wyatt hit three sixes, two off Grimmett; usually, he was a dour, defensive batsman. After the second six, Wyatt saw Jardine leave his seat on the pavilion balcony and return to the dressing room. The third six, a hook off the bowling of Wall, was nearly caught by Bradman at long leg. At one point during the stand, Leyland complained to the umpires that Ironmonger was using resin on the ball to increase his grip and allow him to spin the ball more. Ironmonger emptied his pocket to show there was nothing there, and Leyland apologised. However, Ironmonger seemed less effective after the challenge and umpire Hele remembered that Ironmonger emptied the wrong pocket and Leyland did not ask him to empty the other. Later in the day, Jardine sent out a message to the umpires pointing out that Richardson was changing his position behind the batsmen's backs. Wall tried bowling leg theory against Wyatt, but without a packed legside field, but Wyatt hooked the ball over the fielders' heads. Leyland and Wyatt added 100 runs in 90 minutes and the tea interval was taken with the score 4/154. The only possibility of a wicket was when Bert Oldfield failed to stump Leyland off Grimmett's bowling when the batsman had scored around 30.\nAfter tea, O'Reilly bowled with five fielders on the leg side before dismissing Leyland when the batsman tried to hit a faster ball which bowled him via the bat and pad. Jardine wrote that \"no praise can be too high for this exceedingly fine effort\". He scored 83 from 190 balls in three hours. In all, he hit thirteen fours and his driving on the off-side was praised by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", while Wilfred Rhodes, writing in England, believed that Leyland ought to become Sutcliffe's regular opening partner. Wyatt was dismissed soon afterwards, hitting a poor shot to mid off where Richardson held the catch. He said later that he should have hit the ball for four instead of getting out. He had scored 78 in 164 minutes from 176 balls. Jardine believed it was the best innings Wyatt had played, showing a more adventurous approach than usual for Wyatt and praised his driving, as well as his more familiar cuts and hooks. Jardine wrote that it was \"a truly excellent display at a critical time\". \"Wisden\" noted that Leyland and Wyatt \"if enjoying a certain amount of luck, batted, in the circumstances, uncommonly well\". The score was 6/196 and the innings was in danger of collapse. Australia took the new ball with the score at 200. Eddie Paynter held the innings together until the close of play, scoring 25 runs, using good footwork to attack Grimmett. However, after twice cutting Stan McCabe for four, Gubby Allen was leg before wicket (lbw) to Grimmett for 15 at 7/228. England reached the close of play at 7/236 with Verity on five. Jardine praised the bowling of Wall on the first day, but noted that by the final session, he was too tired to be effective.\n14 January: Day Two.\nThe second day's was watched by a record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50,962. Before play began, Paynter had been shaken when, en route to the cricket ground, an assailant knocked him to the floor before running away. Nevertheless, he and Verity resumed their overnight partnership and batted until lunch. Paynter frequently stretched forward to smother the spin bowling of O'Reilly and was not troubled by Grimmett. He was able to score by hitting the ball into the covers, while Verity concentrated on defence apart from a drive through point off Ironmonger. Both men looked to take quick runs as the fielders moved in to gather the ball. The only dangers came when Paynter slipped and Fingleton missed a chance to run him out when his throw missed the stumps, and Verity edged the ball past O'Reilly, standing too close at slip, from the bowling of Ironmonger. By the first interval of the day, the overnight batsmen had added 79 in the morning session, taking the total to 7/315.\nA short ball from Wall removed Paynter for 77 when the Lancastrian tried to pull and was caught behind square leg. He received an excellent reception from the crowd and had added 96 with Verity. Wall then bowled Voce, who moved too far across the pitch and left his leg stump exposed, and had Verity caught by Richardson after scoring 45 in two-and-a-half hours. The English innings ended at 341, a substantial recovery after the poor start. Wall had figures of five wickets for 72 (5/72), while O'Reilly had bowled 50 overs two wickets. Jardine was disappointed that Larwood and Voce did not extend the innings, conscious that England now faced a long session of fielding as tea was taken between the innings.\nWoodfull now opened Australia's batting with Jack Fingleton. Fingleton did not last long. Jardine believed that he, along with Richardson and McCabe, was showing an increasing mastery over bodyline. However, Jardine had noted that Fingleton had shown some uncertainty outside his off-stump against Gubby Allen during his innings of 83 at Melbourne. He now used Allen, bowling into the wind, to attack Fingleton. In Allen's second over, Fingleton was dismissed for a duck, touching a ball which was caught behind by Ames. Bradman now came to the middle, to an excellent reception.\nMeanwhile, Larwood was surprised to find that he was making the ball swing into Woodfull, instead of away from right-handers as he usually did. Larwood bowled the third over of the innings; the fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull's head. The final ball was short and on the line of middle stump and struck Woodfull over the heart. The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest and bent over in pain. The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily. Jardine called to Larwood: \"Well bowled, Harold!\" Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman, Woodfull was appalled. Play was briefly delayed while Woodfull recovered and continued once it was certain he could carry on. Larwood's over had ended and Woodfull did not face the bowling of Allen in the next over. However, when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again, play was again halted. Subsequently, Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change, Larwood said that Jardine had done so. The fielders were moved into bodyline positions, causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team, even more so than when Woodfull was hit. Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the spectators became extremely volatile from anger. They viewed it as hitting a man when he was down. Mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball. Some English players later expressed fears that a large-scale riot and that the police would not be able to stop the irate home crowd, who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed, from attacking them. Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have retired hurt if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment. It is likely that Jardine wished to press home his team's advantage in the match, while the bodyline field was usually employed at that stage of an innings.\nShortly afterwards, a delivery from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat from his hands and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted for an hour and a half. Vic Richardson replaced him at the crease. When an injury to Voce required a request for a doctor, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest.\nAt the other end, Bradman was trying to defend stoutly with a straight bat over the ball, but with extra bounce, Larwood was causing the vertically challenger Bradman difficulty. Bradman was unable to keep one defensive shot down and it flew to Allen at short leg. Bradman was out for eight and McCabe came in at 2/18. McCabe felt that there was too much bounce for vertical-bat defensive shots to be effective and he tried to counterattack like he had in Sydney. On this occasion, he mistimed a hook from Larwood and was caught by Jardine at midwicket for eight.\nAustralia were 3/34 when Bill Ponsford came in to join his Victorian captain.\nWoodfull battled it out for 89 minutes, collecting more bruises before Allen bowled him for 22, leaving the score at 4/51.\nLater in the day, the English team manager Pelham Warner visited the Australian dressing room to express his sympathies to Woodfull. Woodfull had remained calm in public, refusing to complain about Jardine's tactics. Woodfull's abrupt response was meant to be private, but it was leaked to the press and became the most famous quotation of this tumultuous period in cricket history:\nWoodfull reportedly added \"This game is too good to be spoilt. It's time some people got out of it\", hinting that he might withdraw his team from competition in protest. Australia's Leo O'Brien later reported that Warner was close to tears following Woodfull's rebuke.\n16–19 January: Day Three to Day Six.\nPonsford was hit all over his back and shoulders because of his strategy of turning away and shielding his bat from the possibility of yielding a catch, and Australian wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield was struck a severe blow to the head while batting on the third day of the match, causing a fracture (although this was from a top edge off a traditional non-bodyline ball and Oldfield admitted it was his fault). While the crowd again showed their rage, Woodfull came onto the ground to help Oldfield back to the dressing room. As a result of the injuries, the costs of insurance cover for players doubled. During the fifth day's play the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket sent the following cable to the MCC in London:\nJardine threatened to withdraw his team from the Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC backed their captain but offered to abandon the tour. They asked the Australians to propose a law change if they disagreed with the tactics and blamed the batsmen for the injuries. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons warned the Australian Board of the severe economic hardships that could result if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the Fourth Test, thus saving the tour.\nIn the meantime, the second innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near-impossible 532 for victory; even today, the highest successful Test run chase is 418. Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood. Woodfull was joined by Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull."

        "text": "The 2010 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2009–10 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs, held from June 3 to 17, 2010. A best-of-seven playoff series, it was contested between the Western Conference champion and defending champion Los Angeles Lakers and the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics. It was their twelfth Finals meeting overall.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers earned home court advantage for finishing the regular season with a better record. Though the Lakers were heavily favored and won the opening game on their home court, the Celtics led 3–2 entering Game 6 before Los Angeles rallied to win the next two games. Bryant was named Most Valuable Player of the Finals for the second consecutive year.\nBackground.\nThe Lakers had won the previous season's NBA Finals against the Orlando Magic for the franchise's 15th championship. The Celtics won their previous NBA Finals appearance against the Lakers in 2008. This was the 12th Finals played between the two rival teams. The Celtics won nine of their previous 11 Finals meetings against the Lakers, winning in , , , , , , , , and , while the Lakers won in and .\nRegular-season series.\nThe regular season series was split, with each team winning on the opponent's court by only a point:\nBoston Celtics.\nThe Celtics finished the regular season as the Atlantic Division champion with a 50–32 record. As the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference, they eliminated the No. 5 seeded Miami Heat in five games during the first round in the playoffs. Then in the conference semifinals, Boston defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games, the earliest that a top seed has been eliminated since the Dallas Mavericks' first round loss to the Golden State Warriors in 2007. In the Eastern Conference finals, the Celtics went on to eliminate the Orlando Magic in six games. In reaching the Finals the Boston Celtics became the first team in NBA history to do so with a better regular season road record than home. Also, the Boston Celtics became the second team in NBA history to reach the NBA Finals after beating the team with the best record, Cleveland Cavaliers, and team with second-best record in the league, Orlando Magic, after the Houston Rockets did it in their championship season of 1995.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nAfter the Lakers won the Finals in the preceding year, the team management wasted no time in making changes to the roster. Their most notable offseason player change was when Trevor Ariza departed to the Houston Rockets and was replaced by free agent Ron Artest. Longtime assistant coach and former head coach Kurt Rambis left the organization to pursue a head coaching opportunity with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Lakers finished the regular season as the Pacific Division champion, compiling a 57–25 record. On February 1, Kobe Bryant moved past Jerry West into 14th place on the NBA's career scoring list. He also surpassed West to become the Lakers franchise scoring leader.\nAs the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, they eliminated the No. 8 seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in six games during the Western Conference First Round Playoffs, with the final game ending when Kobe Bryant missed a jumper but Pau Gasol grabbed the offensive rebound and made a layup to clinch the win. Then in the Western Conference Semifinals, Los Angeles swept the Utah Jazz in four games, earning their right to play in their third straight Western Conference Final. In the Western Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns, the Lakers won both of their first two games at home, but proceeded to lose the next two in Phoenix both by 9 points. In Game 5, Ron Artest made an off balance layup to beat the buzzer off a Kobe Bryant miss to give the Lakers the victory. The Lakers then proceeded to beat the Suns on their home floor in Game 6 led by Kobe Bryant's 37 points. The Game 6 victory gave the Lakers their 31st NBA Finals appearance in franchise history. The team also earned their third straight consecutive appearance in the Finals, with the last team to achieve such a feat being the 2000-2002 Los Angeles Lakers themselves.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nBoth teams started strong, playing a close game for most of the 1st quarter until a 7–2 Los Angeles run inspired by bench players Jordan Farmar and Shannon Brown to end the quarter. Boston again started the 2nd quarter strong. However, Los Angeles managed to extend the lead 50–41 at the end of the first half with another run led by Ron Artest and Pau Gasol. More of the same came in the 3rd quarter, as Los Angeles matched nearly all of Boston's attempts to get back in the game. To end the 3rd quarter, Los Angeles went on a 15–4 run to give L. A. a 20-point lead going into the 4th quarter. While the Celtics would try to get back into the game with Nate Robinson and 2008 Finals MVP Paul Pierce, they never got closer than 11 points. The game was capped off with a three-pointer by Kobe Bryant with 3.6 seconds left, securing his 10th 30-point game in his last 11. Boston was outplayed by Los Angeles in nearly every statistical category, most notably in rebounding (31–42) and second-chance points (0–16). Much of the Celtics' performance came from Kevin Garnett, who finished with 16 points (on 16 shots) and 2 rebounds. Ray Allen, who was hampered by foul trouble, finished with 12 points and 5 personal fouls.\nGame 2.\nBoston came out much more aggressively to begin game 2. Los Angeles fought back (Pau Gasol had nine points in the quarter) and managed to reduce Boston's lead to seven points at the end of the 1st quarter. In the 2nd quarter, Ray Allen hit an impressive five three-pointers (only missing once) to add to the two that he hit in the first quarter. This explosive offensive output pushed Boston forward and allowed them to lead by as many as 14 points. Kobe Bryant and Los Angeles put up a quick 7–0 run to end the first half to cut it to a 54–48 Boston lead. Foul trouble plagued players of both squads, with many players having three fouls going into the break. The Lakers would continue their attack and managed to take the lead 57–56 early in the 3rd. Both teams fought hard, leading to the 72–72 tie going into the 4th. The final quarter was dominated by the Celtics, though, as Rajon Rondo's 10 points in the quarter helped tie the series 1–1. Rondo finished with an impressive triple-double of 19 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, and Allen hit eight of 11 three-pointers to secure the NBA Finals record.\nThe last Finals series to be tied at 1–1 after two games was the 2004 NBA Finals which involved the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons.\nGame 3.\nPrior to the start of the game, singer Monica performed the national anthem. Kevin Garnett scored the first six points of the game to give the Celtics a 6–0 lead and eventually helped the team to a seven-point lead (12–5) early in the first quarter. Following the first full timeout of the game, the Lakers scored 13 straight points thanks in part to free throws by Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol. After the score was tied at 16–16, the Lakers outscored the Celtics 10–1 for the remainder of the first quarter.\nThe Lakers' 32–8 run continued well into the second quarter when Bryant completed a free throw after being fouled by forward Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis en route to making a layup 43 seconds into the game. Further helping to widen the gap was Shannon Brown who made a 20-foot jumper from a Lamar Odom assist. Odom, Farmar, and Bynum also made shots to widen the score to 17 points above Boston. The Celtics would soon create their own comeback with an 11–4 run before the Lakers called for a full timeout. Bryant made jumper on a Gasol assist while Pierce shot another three-pointer on a Rondo assist. The final two minutes of the first half ended in a shootout both Celtics and Lakers starters resulting in a 52–40 Los Angeles lead.\nThe first few minutes of the second half proved to be a slow start for both teams as Boston piled 2–8 shooting while Los Angeles posted 2–11 shooting before the first full timeout. Gasol made a 20-foot jumper to give the Lakers their first points of the third quarter; Garnett responded by a 20-foot jumper. Shortly after making his third shot from beyond-the-arc, Pierce received his fourth foul sending him to the bench. Odom, who replaced a limping Bynum, also earned two fouls of his own in addition to bad passing. The Celtics soon took advantage of the Lakers problems when Davis, Tony Allen, and Rasheed Wallace managed to successfully hit several critical shots to end the quarter on a six-point deficit.\nThe Celtics continued their momentum into the fourth quarter eventually pulling to within one point after two minutes. After coming off the bench to replace a struggling Gasol in the fourth quarter, Derek Fisher made a 12-foot jumper in what would be another of his finest postseason performances in his career. He then made four consecutive shots to give the Lakers a 78–73 lead before earning a foul on Ray Allen. With 1:40 left in the game, Bryant made his lone shot of the quarter despite posting 25 points in the first three periods combined. Foul troubles for both Garnett and Pierce hurt the Celtics chances of closing the gap with the Lakers. Pierce made one final layup with five seconds left in the game, but the Lakers edged the Celtics with a 91–84 victory to take a 2–1 lead in the series. Bryant was the leading scorer of the game with 29 points; Garnett's 25 points bested all other Celtics players for Game 3. Derek Fisher scored 11 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter. Compared to his record eight three-point field goals in Game 2, Ray Allen went a near-record 0–13 in field goals for this game.\nGame 4.\nAfter the first quarter, the Celtics held a 19–16 lead; Paul Pierce scored eight points in the quarter for Boston, while Pau Gasol had eight points for Los Angeles. The Lakers rebounded to take a three-point lead entering halftime. Los Angeles maintained a two-point lead following the third quarter, in which Kobe Bryant made three three-point baskets. Early in the fourth quarter, the Celtics went on a run that gave them control of the game; with a lineup that featured four reserves, Boston outscored the Lakers 13–2 over nearly half the quarter. The Celtics held an 11-point lead with 3:57 remaining, but the Lakers mounted a late comeback bid behind Bryant, who posted 10 of the final 12 points for Los Angeles. Three free throws with 1:08 remaining pulled the Lakers within 92–86, and they had an opportunity to get closer in the final minute; however, a Bryant pass was stolen by Rondo, who subsequently made a layup to extend the Celtics' lead. Pierce led Boston with 19 points in the game. The Celtics benefitted from strong bench play, as their reserves doubled the scoring of the Lakers' backups. Davis scored 18 points (nine in the fourth quarter) and Nate Robinson added 12. For the Lakers, Bryant and Gasol, with 33 and 21 points respectively, accounted for most of the team's scoring. Andrew Bynum was unable to play in the second half because of a knee injury.\nGame 5.\nBoston started the game with a 6–0 run, and ended the first quarter leading by 2 on a strong performance by Paul Pierce. After a short Laker run, the Celtics pushed the lead to 6 by the end of the half, with Pierce shooting 7–10, scoring 15 points, despite the Celtics only getting to the free-throw line six times. Pierce's three-pointer pushed the Celtics' lead to double digits, 50–39, early in the third quarter, but the Lakers chipped away at that lead to bring it down to 8, as the Celtics went into the fourth quarter attempting to maintain a 73–65 advantage. With the Celtics leading by 12 with less than three minutes to play, seven straight free throws by the Lakers cut the lead to 87–82 with a little over 40 seconds in the game. On an inbounds play, Garnett lobbed the ball to Pierce, who, while falling out of bounds, hurled it toward a streaking Rondo, who laid it up and in, essentially icing the game with a 7-point lead with 35 seconds to play. Garnett chipped in with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Rondo played well, shooting 9–12 from the floor for 18 points, 8 assists and 5 rebounds. The game featured a 38-point performance by Bryant (hitting numerous shots in the 3rd quarter), being the only Lakers player to score over 12 points and one of only two in double figures. Pierce, on the other hand, would dominate the game with 27 points on 57% shooting from the floor.\nThis was the Celtics' last win in the NBA Finals until Game 1 of the 2022 NBA Finals.\nGame 6.\nThe Lakers returned to Los Angeles with a 3–2 deficit in the series. This was an elimination game for them, and the Celtics were one game away from the championship. Boston starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a serious knee injury in the first quarter, rendering the Celtics more vulnerable on defense and rebounding. The desperate Lakers opened up a massive lead, peaking at 27. The Lakers' bench had outscored Boston's bench 24–0 entering the fourth quarter.\nIt was later revealed that Perkins tore both his PCL and MCL, and he was ruled out for Game 7. His Lakers counterpart, Andrew Bynum left the game early in the third quarter due to swelling in his knee from a torn meniscus. He, however, was not ruled out for Game 7.\nGame 7.\nThis game was the first Game 7 in an NBA Finals since five years earlier. Both the Celtics and Lakers kept the game close early in the first quarter with each team holding a one-point lead. Suddenly, the Lakers offense began to falter with starters missing field goals and easy layups. The Celtics utilized their opponents struggles to widen their lead. After the team's first full timeout, the Celtics managed to outscore the Lakers 6–1, with Davis scoring four points on questionable calls. Boston held the Lakers to only 14 points and took a 23–14 lead ending the first quarter.\nAt the start of the second quarter, the Lakers got back in the game by scoring 11 straight points to take a two-point lead over Boston. The lead proved to be brief, however, as Rajon Rondo and Kevin Garnett scored two-pointers to regain control of the game. Nevertheless, the Lakers continued to score points, with Ron Artest hitting 3 of his 4 free throws in the quarter to maintain a four-point deficit. Before the second quarter concluded, Paul Pierce sunk a pair of free throws to end the first half with a 40–34 Celtics lead.\nThe Celtics opened the second half going on a 9–2 run which widened their lead over the Lakers by as much as 13 points, 49–36. The turning point for the Lakers however arrived after the team took a twenty-second timeout. Bryant made a running jumper on a Lamar Odom assist in what would turn out to be a 6–2 run by the Lakers cutting their deficit to six points behind Boston. Pierce then scored a three-pointer to restore the lead to nine. As the third quarter drew to a close, the Lakers continued their momentum as Bryant completed a 4-foot jumper while Gasol hit two free throws. Lakers reserve Lamar Odom made a tip shot to make the score 57–53 at the end of the quarter.\nThe Lakers' fortunes rode high midway through the fourth quarter as Fisher sunk a three-point field goal from 26-feet to tie the game at 64. Despite having a poor night offensively, Bryant hit two free throws and followed through with a 17-foot shot to give the Lakers a 68–64 lead, the team's first lead since early in the second quarter. Gasol hit two more free throws on a Garnett foul to extend that margin to six. The Celtics would not give up, however, as with Lakers leading by 6 with a minute-and-a-half remaining, Wallace hit a three-pointer to cut the Lakers' lead to 76–73. Although Artest exhibited shooting difficulties throughout the game, he answered in spectacular fashion by sinking a three-point goal to restore his team's lead back to six with a minute remaining in the game. It would prove to be the lethal blow for the Celtics. The Celtic offense suffered heavily in the fourth quarter as four key players (Garnett, Davis, Pierce, and Wallace) earned four or more personal fouls. Wallace would later depart from the game after fouling out. After Artest's three, Allen would respond with a three-pointer of his own to cut the Lakers' lead to three again. In the ensuing play, Bryant attempted a three, but the three missed. Fortunately for the Lakers, Gasol was there to get the crucial offensive rebound. Gasol then passed the ball to Bryant, who was then fouled by Wallace, fouling him out. Bryant attained two more free throws on Wallace's foul to extend the lead to five, 81–76. After a Celtic timeout, Allen attempted a three-pointer but he missed it. Rondo grabbed the offensive rebound and hit a three-pointer to bring the Celtics within two, 81–79. However, the Celtics were forced to foul Sasha Vujačić, consequently enabling the Laker guard to complete two free throws and help his team take a four-point lead, 83–79, over Boston. With 11.7 seconds left in the game, Rondo made one last-ditch effort to revive the Celtics' hopes by attempting a three-pointer. The ball missed the basket enabling Gasol to make a defensive rebound. Gasol passed the ball to Odom who quickly threw it to the opposite end of the court in the hands of Bryant as the buzzer sounded.\nBryant, despite shooting 6 for 24 from the field, scored 10 of his game-high 23 points in the fourth quarter. He was named the Finals MVP for the second straight season. Pierce led the Celtics with 18 points and ten rebounds, but he shot 5–15 from the field. The Lakers had 23 offensive rebounds and out-rebounded the Celtics, 53–40. Gasol had 18 rebounds and Bryant added 15. Los Angeles shot 37 free throws to Boston's 17. After the game, Lakers head coach Phil Jackson hailed Artest, who scored 20 points in Game 7 including his last-second three-pointer, as the \"Most Valuable Player\" of the game.\nBroadcasting.\nFor the eighth consecutive year in the United States, ABC televised the Finals. Mike Breen, Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy provided commentary for the games. The Finals was also broadcast on ESPN Radio, with Jim Durham, Hubie Brown and Jack Ramsay calling the action. Game 1 was watched by 14.1 million viewers, the most watched Finals opening game since . The viewership for the opening game resulted in a ratings percentage of 8.6% of households in the United States. Game 7 had the highest average number of viewers with 28.2 million, since when 35.9 million watched the Chicago Bulls defeat the Utah Jazz in Game 6 of that year's Finals. The average number of viewers of 18.1 million, was the highest since . The flagship radio stations of the respective teams broadcast all Series games with their local announcers. In Los Angeles, KSPN carried the Lakers' English-language broadcasts, with Spero Dedes and Mychal Thompson announcing, while KWKW aired the team's Spanish broadcasts. In Boston, WEEI carried the Celtics' English broadcasts with Sean Grande and Cedric Maxwell announcing.\nImpact and aftermath.\nLakers head coach Phil Jackson earned his 11th title, further extending his record for most championships earned by either an NBA coach or any coach/manager in a major North American professional sports league. It was also his 13th title, as he had won two as a player with the Knicks in and . Bryant won his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP Award. He later said that this championship win was the \"sweetest\" because it was against the longtime, storied rivals and was the toughest series by far. Furthermore, Lakers forward Luke Walton and his father Hall of Famer Bill Walton became the only (as of 2011) father and son to both have won multiple NBA championships Bill in and and Luke in and 2010. Lastly, this would become Kobe Bryant's final championship, and, as of the , the most recent Finals meeting between the Lakers and the Celtics.\nLakers.\nThe series win brought the Lakers' franchise NBA championship total to 16, second only to the Celtics' 17 championships. This also marked the 11th title for the team since , and it was the franchise's fifth Finals win in eleven seasons. Notably, this was the Lakers' first Game 7 win over the Celtics in Finals history, Boston had won all previous matchups. Moreover, the Lakers were now 3–9 against Boston since the two teams first competed against each other in the NBA Finals.\nOn June 21, a victory parade took place for the Lakers. Unlike like previous years, however, there was no pep rally that followed after the end of the parade due to both security and financial reasons. The team was transported around on an open-air float equipped with loudspeakers enabling the players to talk to the spectators. The parade began at 11 a.m local time at Staples Center, turned east on Chick Heart Court, turned south onto Figueroa Street, then east onto Jefferson Boulevard before entering beneath Interstate 110. The parade concluded at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Grand Avenue near the University of Southern California's Galen Center. Occasionally, Ron Artest led the crowd in chanting \"Boston sucks!\" Over 65,000 people were estimated to have attended the parade. Most of the 2009–10 Lakers team were on hand to receive their championship rings before the start of the season opener against the Houston Rockets on October 26. They also visited U.S. president Barack Obama at the THEARC Boys and Girls Club in Washington, DC. in December 2010, presenting him with a banner declaring the Lakers as 2009–10 NBA World Champions.\nIn November, Time Capsule Press published a book entitled \"Journey to the Ring: Behind the Scenes with the 2010 NBA Champions Lakers\". The book, written by coach Jackson, featured various photographs from sports photographer Andrew D. Bernstein chronicling the Lakers 2009–10 season en route to their triumph against the Celtics.\nThe Lakers struggled since the , missing the playoffs for multiple years. They did not return to the Finals until , defeating the Miami Heat and winning their 17th title, which tied the Celtics for the most in league history.\nCeltics.\nAllen departed for the Miami Heat in 2012, while Pierce and Garnett were traded to the Brooklyn Nets the following offseason. Also in the 2013 offseason, Rivers took over as the Los Angeles Clippers head coach, and the last remaining piece of the “Big Four”, Rondo, was traded to the Dallas Mavericks early in the 2014–15 season. Rondo would ironically join the Lakers in 2018 and win\na championship with them in 2020. The Celtics did not return to the Finals until 2022, attempting to win their 18th title (which would've broke a tie with the Lakers for the most in franchise history). Their Finals record remained tied when the Golden State Warriors won the series in 6 games."

His brother George Dobson was also a rugby player who represented Cardiff and Wales.\nRugby career.\nDobson was born in the small fishing village of Keiss in Caithness, Scotland, but by 1873 his family was living in the Pontypridd area of Wales. In the 1890s Dobson had moved to the Cardiff Docks area where he had become a coal trimmer. With the industrialisation of South Wales, heavy labourers began filling the forward positions in many Welsh club teams, and Dobson became part of the pack for Cardiff RFC, one of the Wales' most prominent teams.\nIn 1898, Wales were readmitted into the Home Nations Championship after agreements were made to settle the Gould Affair. Dobson was one of seven new caps introduced into the Welsh team, and one of five in a vastly changed pack. Although the back positions were full of Cardiff players, Dobson was only supported by one teammate in the pack, Fred Cornish, who was only collecting his second cap that match. The game was played away against Ireland, and without Arthur Gould, Wales were now captained by experienced fullback Billy Bancroft. Bancroft was in good form during the match scoring a penalty goal and a conversion. Two tries were scored by Wales in an 11-3 win, one from Viv Huzzey and the other scored by Dobson himself; his first and only international score. After the win, Dobson was reselected in a near unchanged squad that faced and lost to England in the final match of the 1898 Championship.\nDobson was back in the Wales squad the next year in the 1899 Championship, joined in the pack only by David Daniel and Willie Alexander from the previous season, the other five players all being new caps. The first game of the Championship was against England, and Dobson was part of the team that secured a record win over the English, with Welsh wing Willie Llewellyn scoring four tries. Dobson's final game was the Championship encounter with Scotland in 1899 which Wales lost 21-10.\nInternational matches played for Wales.\nWales"

While at Canterbury he was asked by the coach, Alex Wyllie to move from the mid-field to the wing as Canterbury also had Warwick Taylor and Victor Simpson in the squad.

        "text": "The men's vault competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The qualification and final rounds took place on September 16 and 25 at the Sydney SuperDome. There were 80 competitors from 31 nations; nations competing in the team event could have up to 5 gymnasts in the vault, while other nations could have up to 2 gymnasts. The event was won by Gervasio Deferr of Spain, the nation's first medal in the men's vault. Poland also earned its first medal in the event, with Leszek Blanik's bronze. Silver went to Alexei Bondarenko of Russia.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the eight finalists from 1996 returned: gold medalist Alexei Nemov of Russia, silver medalist Yeo Hong-Chul of South Korea, and eighth-place finisher Ivan Pavlovski of Belarus. Li Xiaopeng of China was the reigning (1999) world champion; Sergey Fedorchenko had been world champion in 1997.\nLatvia made its debut in the men's vault. The United States made its 18th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 vault and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). The 1996 gymnastics competition had introduced the \"7–6–5\" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. In 2000, this was reduced across the board to a \"6–5–4\" format. Further, while in 1996 all 7 team members could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes, in 2000 only the 5 designated for that apparatus competed. The 2000 competition also eliminated the compulsory exercises; only voluntary exercises were done on each apparatus. The qualifying round scores were used for qualification for the team all-around, individual all-around, and apparatus finals.\nThe top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 80th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise. For the vault, the final consisted of two attempts per gymnast, with the average score of the two counting.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nEighty gymnasts competed in the vault event during the qualification round on September 16. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 25. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final."

        "title": "Bonus (basketball)",
        "text": "In the sport of basketball, the bonus situation (also called the penalty situation) occurs when one team accumulates a requisite number of fouls, the number of which varies depending on the level of play. When one team has committed the requisite number of fouls, each subsequent foul results in the opposing team's taking free throws regardless of the type of foul committed (i.e., whether or not the foul was a shooting foul). Teams under the limit are commonly referred to as having fouls to give, and thus they can try to disrupt their opponents without being penalized free throws. These fouls reset every quarter or half depending on the rules in use (i.e. FIBA, NBA, NCAA, etc.).\nFIBA.\nUnder FIBA rules, used for all competitions involving international teams and most leagues outside the U.S., the penalty is triggered when a team commits more than four fouls in a quarter; the fifth and subsequent team fouls will incur penalty free throws. All subsequent non-shooting defensive fouls committed by that team in the same quarter concede two free throws. All fouls committed by players count towards the team foul count.\nOnly defensive fouls are awarded free throws.\nTeam fouls accrue from the fourth period on, as all overtimes are extensions of it for the purpose of team foul accumulation.\nEffective in October 2022, FIBA adopted the NBA's Rule 12-b, Section X (\"Away from the Play Foul\"), called in the FIBA language a \"throw-in foul\", defined as a defensive foul committed in the last 2 minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime period, during a throw-in, but before the ball is released by the thrower. Regardless of the penalty situation, the non-fouling team receives 1 free throw and possession.\nFIBA 3x3.\nThe 3-man game, known as FIBA 3x3, has a slightly different penalty rule. The penalty is triggered when a team commits more than six fouls in a game. Each penalty situation involves two penalty free throws, and the tenth and subsequent fouls will also include possession of the ball.\nThe bonus rule specifically supersedes the normal rules for defensive fouls on shot attempts. Instead of the 1 shot awarded on a made basket or a missed 1-point shot attempt, or the 2 free throws awarded on a missed 2-point shot attempt, 2 free throws are always awarded regardless of the result of the shot attempt.\nHowever, as in standard basketball rules, offensive fouls (if not technical or unsportsmanlike) never result in free throws, regardless of the number of team fouls.\nNBA and WNBA.\nTeam foul penalty.\nIn the National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association, bonus rules in a quarter apply starting with the fifth team foul, with a rule change preventing a team not in the penalty late in a period from committing multiple fouls without penalty. The rules on the team foul penalty are similar to the FIBA version, with three major differences:\nOnly defensive and loose-ball fouls count towards a team's limit for the team foul penalty. Offensive fouls do not count towards the team foul penalty unless a player is in the player foul penalty situation.\nThe team foul penalty applies after a team commits two fouls in the final two minutes of a period if the team had not yet reached the penalty phase in the first ten (NBA) or eight (WNBA) minutes of that period. In other words, within any period, free throws are awarded starting from the fifth foul or from the second foul within the last two minutes of the period, whichever comes earlier.\nIf a game enters overtime, the foul counts are reset, with the penalty phase commencing with the fourth foul in each overtime period rather than five for regulation periods, since overtime periods are much shorter than regulation periods (5 minutes vs. 10/12 in regulation play). As in regulation play, two free throws are awarded for non-shooting defensive fouls during the bonus, and one foul in the final two minutes automatically puts the team in the team foul penalty.\nPlayer foul penalty.\nA player who commits their sixth (and subsequent) personal foul and must remain in the game because the team has no eligible players remaining is charged with a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul, with the penalty of a single free throw, regardless of offensive or defensive foul. Likewise, a player who was the last player to commit six fouls is called back into the game if no eligible players remain following an injury or ejection. The player cannot be ejected for a technical foul in either situation.\nThis type of technical foul serves in effect as a \"player foul penalty\" of a bonus free throw, similar to the team foul penalty. However, this bonus free throw is awarded regardless of the foul being an offensive or defensive foul, unlike a team foul penalty, where two free throws are only allowed for defensive fouls. If a player commits his/her sixth or subsequent foul while on offense and there are no eligible players available to take their place on the court, one free throw is still awarded, in addition to possession of the ball to the team shooting the free throw.\nNCAA.\nThe bonus situation is also used in American men's college basketball, but the NCAA rules are very different from the bonus rules of the NBA. The basic bonus rules remain the same, but the limit for team fouls is six per half. Upon committing the seventh foul of the half, a team is penalized and the opposing team is awarded at least one free throw for any defensive or loose-ball foul, no matter if the foul was shooting or non-shooting (offensive fouls are never awarded free throws in the NCAA). In the case of a non-shooting foul, the opposing player must make the first free throw in order to be awarded a second free throw. This is commonly referred to as \"one-and-one\". (A shooting foul is not subject to this requirement; the player will get all free throw attempts allowed by the rules regardless of the result of the preceding shot.) Beginning with the tenth foul of a half, the fouled team is awarded two free throws on non-shooting fouls regardless of whether the first shot is made (often referred to as the \"double bonus\"). For purposes of bonus, team fouls accrue from the second half on, as all overtimes are extensions of it.\nWomen's college basketball followed men's bonus rules until the 2015–16 season, when it adopted FIBA bonus rules: four fouls per period; two free throws on every team foul over four; team fouls accrue from the fourth period on, as all overtimes are extensions of it.\nThe NCAA regularly uses its second-tier tournament for Division I men's teams, the National Invitation Tournament, as a testing ground for experimental rules, and the bonus situation is no exception. The following bonus-related rules have been used in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 editions:\nOn May 15, 2023, the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which governs high school basketball in the United States, announced that it would adopt the FIBA bonus rules.

        "title": "Eight (rowing)",
        "text": "An eight, abbreviated as an 8+, is a racing shell used in competitive rowing (crew). It is designed for eight rowers, who propel the boat with sweep oars, and is steered by a coxswain, or \"cox\".\nEach of the eight rowers has one oar. The rowers, who sit in a line in the centre of the boat and facing the stern, are usually placed alternately, with four on the port side (rower's right hand side – also traditionally known as \"stroke side\") and four on the starboard side (rower's lefthand side – known as \"bow side\"). The cox steers the boat using a rudder and is normally seated at the stern of the boat. Because of the size, weight, and speed of the boat in comparison to the 4+ and 2+, it is generally considered unsafe to race the 8+ coxless or to have a bowloader cox.\nRacing boats (often called \"shells\") are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag to a minimum. Originally made from wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material (usually carbon-fibre reinforced plastic) for strength and weight advantages. Eights have a fin towards the rear, to help prevent roll and yaw and to help the rudder. The riggers are staggered alternately along the boat so that the forces apply asymmetrically to each side of the boat. If the boat is sculled by rowers each with two oars the combination is referred to as an octuple scull. In a scull boat, the riggers apply forces symmetrically. A sweep oared boat has to be stiffer to handle the unmatched forces, and so requires more bracing, which means it has to be heavier and slower than an equivalent sculling boat. However, octuple sculls are not used in main competitions. \n\"Eight\" is one of the classes recognized by the International Rowing Federation and one of the events in the Olympics. The first Olympic eights race was held in 1900 and won by the United States."

        "text": "Darrell Christopher Williams is a New Zealand rugby league selector and NRL Judiciary member and a former footballer and coach. A New Zealand international representative outside back, he played his club football in the Auckland Rugby League for Mt Albert and in Sydney's NSWRFL Premiership for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (with whom he won the 1987 NSWRL Grand Final) and the Parramatta Eels. He later coached the Samoan national team.\nPlaying career.\nNew Zealand.\nWilliams started his playing career in the Auckland Rugby League competition where he played with the Mt Albert club. His form for Mt Albert also saw him selected to play for the Auckland representative side against touring national sides Great Britain (1984) and Australia (1985). He was selected for the 1985 New Zealand Tour of Great Britain and France and would make his test debut playing on the wing in the third test against Great Britain at the Elland Road ground in Leeds which ended in a 6-all draw. Between 1985 and 1990, Williams gained selection for New Zealand on 21 occasions. He scored 5 tries in his test career including scoring a double in the third game of the 1986 Trans-Tasman Test series against Australia at Lang Park in Brisbane, though Australia would win the game 32–12 and the series 3–0.\nAustralia.\nWilliams moved to Australia to play in the NSWRL premiership for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at the start of the 1987 NSWRL season. He made his debut for the Sea Eagles in the wing in a 4-all draw with St George in the opening round of the season. On 21 July 1987, Williams played fullback for NZ in their shock 13–6 win over Australia at Lang Park. It would be the only time he would be on the winning side in 9 tests against the Australians. He would go on to play in Manly's Grand Final winning team that year, becoming the first Kiwi to play in an Australian grand final-winning team. Following the grand final victory he travelled with Manly to England for the 1987 World Club Challenge against their champions, Wigan.\nDuring the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour the New Zealand national team hosted the British side for a Test match at Addington Showgrounds and Williams played for the Kiwis at fullback in their 12 – 10 defeat of Great Britain on Sunday, 17 July before a crowd of 8,525. The result of this match determined that New Zealand would contest the final of the 1985–1988 World Cup tournament's final to be played later in the year, but Williams did not play.\nDuring the 1989 Kangaroo tour of New Zealand Williams was selected to play for the Kiwis at fullback in all three tests against Australia. In the third test of the 1989 Trans-Tasman series against Australia in Auckland, Williams was on the receiving end of a famous hit from Australian captain; Wally Lewis. This tackle was later described by commentator Ray Warren as easily the biggest he's ever seen.\nDuring the 1990 Great Britain Lions tour Williams played for New Zealand against the British at fullback in the first test and at centre in the 2nd and 3rd. His final test appearance for NZ came on 19 August 1990 when he played in the centres against Australia at the Athletic Park stadium in Wellington, with the Australians winning the game 24–6.\nThe 1994 NSWRL season was Williams last and was spent playing for the Parramatta Eels.\nLater years.\nFollowing his retirement from playing at the end of the 1994 NSWRL season, Williams was appointed a National Rugby League judiciary member. He was later appointed coach of the Samoa national rugby league team for their 2000 World Cup campaign. Samoa reached the quarter-finals where they faced eventual champions Australia and were knocked out. Williams has also been a selector for the New Zealand national side. During the lead up to the 2008 NRL grand final Williams, at the time the longest-serving member of the NRL Judiciary, threatened legal action against the Melbourne Storm for criticism levelled at the judiciary over their controversial suspension of Storm captain Cameron Smith. This led to Storm coach Craig Bellamy and then-CEO Brian Waldron paying out $105,000 plus legal costs to Williams and the other judiciary panellists in late 2010."

        "text": "Rugby union in Luxembourg is a minor but growing sport.\nGoverning Body.\nThe Fédération luxembourgeoise de rugby was founded in May 1973, and joined the IRB in 1991. It was created mainly by French and British expatriates, following the foundation of the first club of the country, the Rugby Club Luxembourg, because the club could not be officially recognised without a national federation.\nHistory.\nRugby was introduced into Luxembourg in the late 1960s. They have traditionally seen themselves as rivals to Andorra, which is in a similar position to them - i.e. a small population, a growing interest in the game, plus the input of many foreigners working there in the finance industry. (Andorra was also to give Luxembourg its first international win, in 1989.)\nLuxembourg played its first international in 1975, against Belgium, which they lost 28-6.\nThe first club, the Rugby Club de Luxembourg was established in the early 1970s, and plays in the Alsace-Lorraine section of the French leagues. A second club, De Renert Walferdange was created in 1990, and plays in the Belgian Championships.\nBecause it neighbours France, one of the world centres of rugby, and French media has strong penetration into Luxembourg, the game has enjoyed an inordinately high-profile. Its proximity to the British Isles has also helped, meaning that they sometimes receive touring clubs from the British Isles, more often than might be expected for a rugby nation of their calibre. Neighbours Belgium, and Germany, and near neighbours, the Netherlands also have thousands of registered players, and whose rugby tradition goes back before World War II.\nIn 2009, there were 2370 registered players in Luxembourg but this number decreased to 846 in 2019.\nThere were three formally organised clubs for seniors: De Renert, and the Rugby Club Luxembourg and a club exclusively for youths, the Cercle Sportif des Communautés Européennes Luxembourg (CSCE-Section Rugby). A fourth club was founded in 2017 in the South of the country in Dudelange, called Rugby Club Terres Rouge. At the moment, the club exclusively caters for the youth, but with the potential for founding a senior team. A fifth club, the Rugby Eagles Luxembourg, was founded in 2019 and became a Member of the Luxembourg Rugby Union in June 2020. This club is exclusively a child-centered rugby project."

He won the doubles title four times with his Davis Cup teammate Willard Crocker in 1923, 1925, and 1929, and once with Marcel Rainville, in 1931.\nAt one point in 1927 he was ranked third in the world, the highest ranking achieved by a Canadian singles player until Milos Raonic in 2016. Wright was also Canada's top ranked tennis player for five years (1926–29 and 1931).\nIn the 1929 Canadian Open Championships, he defeated two prominent American players in the semifinal and final in four-set matches, John Doeg and Frank Shields. These two players would contest the final of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships the following season, Doeg defeating Shields.\nWright competed in the U.S. National Championship for singles tennis five times and reached the round of 16 twice, in 1924 and 1927, losing to Bill Tilden and Bill Johnston respectively. He lost in the first round of Wimbledon in 1929, to Wilbur Coen in four sets, in his only appearance there.\nWright played 14 Davis Cup ties for Canada, over 11 years. He had 6 wins against 20 losses in singles and went 3 and 11 in doubles.\nWright's most famous Davis Cup singles win occurred in 1927, when he defeated Japan's Takeichi Harada, then ranked No. 7 in the world, in three straight sets. In 1932, he lost a close five-set Davis Cup match to Ellsworth Vines, who won at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships that year.\nJack Wright served in WWII as a captain in the Royal Canadian Medical Corps and the Canadian Scottish Regiment in Normandy and France.

A tryout in the Canadian Football League (CFL) was unsuccessful, however in the spring of 1969, he was drafted by the 49ers. \nHoskins suffered injuries and saw little playing time in his first two seasons. However, playing on special teams in the 1971 NFC divisional playoff against the Washington Redskins, he recovered a mis-snapped ball in the end zone, in what proved to be the winning touchdown. Hoskins started all 14 games the next four seasons.\nIn 1974, in the midst of his career, Hoskins was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease and underwent treatment.

Jim McCauley, (born 1967 or 1968) is a former junior ice hockey coach and NHL Players' Association sports agent, best known as the alleged target of a murder-for-hire plot by one of his clients, former St. Louis Blues forward Mike Danton.\nFrost currently operates a sports consulting service and travels across North America providing this service on a contract basis. Frost also wrote his hockey autobiography: hockey book titled \"Frosty: The Good The Bad The Ugly Going Up The Ranks To The NHL\".\nHe at one time worked in Laguna Niguel, California under the alias Jim McCauley working out at the Laguna Niguel Hockey Academy.\nOn August 22, 2006, Frost was charged with 12 counts of sexual exploitation by the Ontario Provincial Police for crimes alleged during 1995–2001. The charges relate to his time as coach of the Quinte Hawks Junior hockey team and involve acts on three females between the ages of 16 and 18 yrs. Frost spent around $200,000 to hire Marie Henein as his defence lawyer. Frost was found not guilty on those charges on November 29, 2008, after the judge in the case found \"some testimony by government witnesses was simply not believable and he feared some of it had been tainted by collusion\". Steve Simmons, writing in The Toronto Sun, criticized the poor performance by the Crown prosecutors, who neglected to call several witnesses who would have likely bolstered the case against Frost.\n\"Brampton Boys\" regime.\nFrost got his start as a coach with the Toronto Young Nationals, a PeeWee club where he coached, among others, Mike Jefferson (later \"Mike Danton\"), Sheldon Keefe, and Joe Goodenow (son of then NHLPA Head Bob Goodenow). He was suspended from the Metro Toronto Hockey League following allegations he forged the signature of the club's general manager. He then took his \"Brampton Boys\", a reference to the Toronto suburban city of Brampton, to the Quinte Hawks Metro Junior A Club in Deseronto. He was suspended from the Hawks after he pleaded guilty to a charge he assaulted (punched) a 21 year old Hawks player after he refused a reach around during a shower.\nFrost's proteges were drafted the following season by Ontario Hockey League (OHL) teams; he was known to frequently attend Sarnia Sting games to monitor the progress of Jefferson, who would eventually be dealt to the Toronto St. Michael's Majors to play with Sheldon Keefe, Ryan Barnes and Shawn Cation, who rounded out the rest of Frost's \"Brampton Boys\". Frost, not officially associated with the team, created so many conflicts with the St. Mike's front office that all four of his \"Brampton Boys\" were traded to the Barrie Colts.\nThe Brampton Boys tenure in Barrie, while productive on the ice, was accompanied by bizarre behavior, especially compared to the traditional deference shown by junior players. Ryan Barnes was suspended for 25 games for a stick-swinging incident, while Shawn Cation was suspended for 15 games for instigating a line brawl. During the 2000 OHL playoffs, team captain Sheldon Keefe visibly refused to shake OHL commissioner David Branch's hand during the presentation of the J. Ross Robertson Cup. While playing at the 2000 Memorial Cup in Halifax, Frost's players led a walkout during a customary banquet and refused to shake hands with CHL commissioner David Branch during ceremonial face-offs. The players would later refuse to stand for the national anthem.\nJefferson would later taunt Rimouski Océanic forward and CHL Player of the Year winner Brad Richards, stating that he wouldn't last five games in the OHL. (The four \"Brampton Boys\" had all finished their NHL careers by 2004 with a combined 219 games played and 39 points, while Richards retired in 2016 with over 1000 NHL regular season and playoff games, over 1000 points, and two Stanley Cups.) The Colts reached the Memorial Cup championship game, where they were defeated 6-2 by the Oceanic. Jefferson refused to shake Richards' hand after he had been named tournament MVP. Jefferson, Keefe and head coach Bill Stewart also walked out of the Halifax Metro Centre without conducting any interviews.\nFrost vs the Jeffersons.\nDavid Frost first approached Danton's parents, Steve and Sue Jefferson, in 1991, successfully recruiting Mike for the Young Nationals. The Jeffersons indicate that their son's recruiter, who later became his agent, wielded a growing influence over their son in the years that followed. As time passed, Frost's influence grew beyond the business of hockey.\nJefferson changed his name to Michael Sage Danton in 2002, a decision Frost said was made by the young player to separate himself from his family. Danton subsequently claimed that the Jefferson family had abused Mike, that they lived in squalor and had abused drugs and alcohol.\nThough Danton made the National Hockey League (NHL), playing 87 games for the New Jersey Devils and St. Louis Blues, Frost retained almost complete control over the player. Frost required his permission for Danton to conduct interviews, and the player frequently asked Frost's opinion on many issues. Following the 2003–04 NHL season, Danton was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after it was alleged he tried to hire a hit man to kill Frost. Danton pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 7½ years in prison, though he later alleged that it was his father he intended to kill, not Frost. Danton's claims were disputed by the FBI and the alleged hitman, both of whom agreed that Frost was the target.\nResignation and charges.\nOn 6 December 2005, the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that Frost has resigned as an NHL player agent. Frost no longer represented players and started a sports consulting company with his wife. Frost once worked with former Vancouver Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis when he was an NHLPA agent.\nOn March 23, 2007, Frost was also charged with fraud, impersonation and breach of probation for allegedly trying to purchase nearly $90 in gasoline by using a credit card registered to Mike Danton. He was acquitted of all charges on February 14, 2009; Danton informed the court that Frost had permission to use his credit cards.\nWhile out on bail awaiting trial on sexual exploitation charges, Frost had his bail conditions amended to allow him to leave Canada. He had intended to attend the Phoenix Coyotes training camp to monitor the progress of a minor-league prospect. However, the Coyotes General Manager indicated that Frost would not be allowed to attend. Since being acquitted on sexual exploitation charges in November, Frost has launched a website designed to unleash secret stories about the NHL, closely guarded playbooks and advice for young players trying to make the big league. Subsequently, Frost's website shut down."

        "text": "Benjamin Davies (5 June 1873 – 23 June 1930) was a Welsh international rugby halfback who played rugby union for Llanelli and was capped twice for Wales. Davies captained Llanelli for the 1894-95 season and was club secretary between 1898 and 1899. He later became the coach of Llandovery College and also wrote sports articles for the Daily Mail.\nRugby career.\nDavies played club rugby for first class Welsh team, Llanelli, and it was while representing the 'Scarlets' that he was first selected to play for Wales. Wales had used the Newport half-back pairing of Percy Phillips and Fred Parfitt, but after the retirement of Phillips, the selectors began experimenting with new pairings. The opening game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship against England saw the introduction of two new caps into the half-back positions, Davies and Cardiff's Selwyn Biggs. Despite experienced and talented backs, including Billy Bancroft, Tom Pearson and captain Arthur Gould, the weak forward play from Wales left the backs hamstrung, and the team lost 6-14. The next game of the Championship saw the selectors retain Biggs, but Davies was replaced by a returning Fred Parfitt.\nDespite playing no further part in the 1895 tournament, Davies was given another international cap the next year, again in the opening game of the tournament against England. This time Davies' half-back partner was Llanelli team mate David Morgan. The Welsh selectors often favoured less able half-back pairing which came from the same club team, giving a level of continuity to the back play. Morgan was first capped in the last game of the 1895 tournament, a home win over Ireland. Morgan was retained, while his partner Ralph Sweet-Escott was dropped to allow Davies another chance. Played away at Rectory Field in Blackheath, Wales were completely outclassed, losing 25-0. Neither Morgan or Davies were ever selected for Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

He was the uncle of Welsh boxer Gipsy Daniels. He was the first of four players known as Bill Morris to represent Wales at rugby union.\nRugby career.\nMorris first played club rugby for local club Felinfoel, before switching to first class Welsh club Llanelli. As a member of Llanelli, Morris was first capped for Wales as an international player, facing Scotland as part of the 1896 Home Nations Championship. Morris came into a vastly changed pack to the one that faced England in the prior game, being one of five new forward caps. Included in the team were four Llanelli players; Morris, Cliff Bowen, Charles Nicholl and Jack Evans. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, Wales beat Scotland by two tries to nil. The selectors kept faith with the team for the last game of the Championship, with the majority of the players returning for the game against Ireland. The aggressive Welsh forward play that was successful against Scotland, failed when faced by Ireland's kick-and-rush tactics and the team lost 4–8 at Lansdowne Road.\nMorris would win one final cap for Wales, in the opening game of the 1897 Championship against England. After being humiliated by England in 1896, the changed forward tactics employing several 'Rhondda Forwards', saw a different result with Wales winning 11–0. Among the pack with Morris, was teammate Evans, the two players beginning and ending their international careers together. Morris may have been chosen for the next game, but Wales were forced to withdraw from the tournament after the outcome of the Gould Affair, and when Wales were readmitted in 1898, Morris was no longer part of the Welsh team.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nNote.\nIn 'Gone North – Volume 2', the 'Errata to (Gone North) Volume 1' section states that \"Detailed research now indicates that Jere Blake and William Morris appear never to have signed for Salford or any other professional club although they do appear to have trialled for Northern Union clubs\"."

        "text": "The Kansas Jayhawks women's basketball team represents the University of Kansas and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I. The Jayhawks are coached by Brandon Schneider. The Jayhawks have failed to match the success of the men's team, only qualifying for 14 NCAA Tournaments and never making it past the Sweet Sixteen. They have, however, won one Women's NIT championship which they won in 2023. Despite the lack of success on the court, the Jayhawks have produced one Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, Lynette Woodard\nHistory.\nKansas first fielded a women's basketball team in 1903. The 1903 team posted a 6-2 record. The team competed as a non-varsity independent squad. In 1912, female students at the University of Kansas launched the Women’s Athletic Association (WAA) with the assistance of physical education instructor Hazel Pratt. Under the WAA, KU women competed against other colleges and universities as a non-varsity club sport. \nKansas first officially fielded a varsity women's basketball team during the 1968–1969 season, though club level women's teams had been fielded as early as 1903. For 31 seasons (1973–2004) the women's team was coached by Marian Washington, who led the team to three Big Eight championships, 11 NCAA Tournament appearances and three AIAW tournament appearances. The team's best post-season result was appearing in the Sweet Sixteen, which they have done five times, most recently in 2013.\nNotable players.\nThe Jayhawks have produced one Hall of Fame player. As of April 2, 2023, Kansas has no players on WNBA rosters but has produced WNBA players in the past.\nConferences.\nThe Jayhawks and the rest of the Big 8, along with four former members of the defunct Southwest Conference, joined and created the Big 12 conference in 1996.\nCoaches.\nKansas first fielded a women's basketball team in 1903. The Jayhawks, at this time, were coached by the inventor of the game James Naismith. After the 1903 season, and until becoming a varsity team in 1968, the Jayhawks did not officially have a coach, and instead had \"player-coaches\" on their rosters. The Jayhawks have had 6 coaches since they began Varsity play in 1968. Marian Washington is all-time leader for the program in years coached, wins, tournament appearances, tournament wins, and win percentage.\nNCAA/AIAW Tournament history.\nThe Jayhawks have appeared in 17 NCAA/AIAW Tournaments. Their combined record is 13–16.\nWomen's NIT.\nThe Jayhawks have appeared in six NIT tournaments. Their combined record is 15–5. They won the 2023 Tournament."

        "text": "Rugby union in Malaysia is a sport with a long history, and a significant participation. There are 41,050 registered players, and the country is currently ranked 47th. There are sixteen unions, associations and councils affiliated to the Malaysian Rugby Union, more than 300 clubs, and 600 schools which teach the game. Malaysian rugby's most notable contribution to the game at large is the invention of rugby tens.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Malaysian Rugby Union (Malaysian: Kesatuan Ragbi Malaysia). The Malaya Rugby Union (as it was then) was founded in 1921 and joined the IRFB in 1988. The founder members were Selangor, Ipoh District, Singapore, Malacca and Negeri Sembilan.\nIt is a founding member of the Asian Rugby Football Union.\nHistory.\nRugby was introduced to the British colony of Malaya in the late nineteenth century. It has had a steady presence since the beginning of the 20th century, when the Malay Cup between Singapore national rugby union team and Malaya was established, which is one of the oldest rugby competitions in the world.\nThere is also the Agong's Cup (Piala Agong, or \"King's Cup\") which is played between the 13 states in Malaysia, the 3 Federal Territories, Royal Malay Regiment (Army) and Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM).\nThe first inter-club match was played in 1902 between Singapore Cricket Club and Royal Selangor Club. Royal Selangor Club has also hosted one of the oldest rugby sevens tournaments in Asia, the Jonah Jones Rugby Sevens Tournament.\nThe Malaysians have been instrumental in setting up a number of other South Asian competitions, which have helped bolster the game in the region, among these were an Asian \"round robin\" tournament between Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. However, while the game is popular at school level, economic factors prevent many people playing after they leave.\nAmong the other Malaysian innovations has been the game of \"tens\" - yet another smaller variant on the usually fifteen a side game.\nMalaysia also has a national sevens team.\nHMS Malaya Cup.\nThe major trophy is the \"HMS Malaya Cup\" which was first presented in 1921 and still is awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens. The original trophy was presented by the officers and men of a British battleship, HMS \"Malaya\". In honour of this, the competition was renamed the HMS Malaya Cup in 1933. An association football cup of the same name began at the same time, but has since changed its name to the Malaysia Cup.\n1998 Commonwealth Games - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nMalaysia is an active participant in the Commonwealth Sevens, and the 1998 Commonwealth Games, held in Kuala Lumpur was the first Commonwealth Games to feature the sport.\nIn front of 20,000 fans at the Petaling Jaya Stadium, Rugby sevens was an enormous success with New Zealand collecting its 100th Commonwealth Games medal with a 21–12 win over the plucky Fiji (the reigning world champions). Man of the match was the giant Jonah Lomu who had worked tirelessly during the 10-minutes each way final. Led by veteran star David Campese, Australia took the bronze beating Samoa 33–12.\nDomestic competitions.\nMRU Super League.\nThis competition that was established in 2004, is the first tier of rugby club competition in Malaysia. It consists of 12 top Malaysian clubs, divided into two groups. The top 4 of each group were advanced to the knockout stage, while the club that being placed at bottom, were relegated to National Inter-Club Championship next year."

        "text": "Rugby union is not a major sport in Singapore. Singapore is currently ranked 58th in the world and 6th in Asia. As of February 2015, there over 12,000 registered players, with more than 2,000 women playing the sport. There are also 15 formally organised clubs with 4 registered Women's sides.\nClub Rugby in Singapore is played in three divisions – the Premiership, the Championship, and the Conference. School Rugby is also contested over three age groups – the C division (under 14), the B division (under 17) and the A division (under 19). There are also a few schools that have a primary school-level rugby programme where they contest in the under-12 competition.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body of rugby union in Singapore is the Singapore Rugby Union (SRU), which was founded in 1966. It joined the International Rugby Football Board (now World Rugby) in 1988.\nHistory.\nThe game is popular among expatriate workers from Commonwealth countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand – and there are at least twenty such rugby clubs founded on this basis. While there has been some take up amongst other groups, and a long-standing effort to involve Singaporeans, including by Australians Peter Randall and Andrew Blades in the mid 1990s, progress in growing the game has only been gradual.\nEarly history.\nRugby union was introduced to the British colony of Singapore in the late 19th century. It has had a steady presence since the beginning of the 20th century, when the Malaya Cup between Singapore Civilians team and states of Malaya was then established, which is one of the oldest rugby competitions in the world.\nHowever, unlike the other colonial city state of Asia, Hong Kong, rugby has not been quite so successful in Singapore. The tragic events of the Second World War and the Japanese occupation of Singapore also disrupted its growth. Between 1945 and 1991, a regiment of New Zealanders was based in Singapore, and during those years they dominated the game to the extent that when they left, the Singaporean rugby scene almost fell apart.\nLocal rugby: 1970s &amp; 1980s.\n1971 saw the launch of an all national U23 team made up of locals from the police force, armed forces, schools and local clubs when it played a curtain raiser game against a Malaysia U23 (which they won), to the main touring England vs Singapore Select game.\n3 Locals were selected in the Singapore Select Squad to play England at Jalan Besar Stadium on 3 October 1971. Leow Kim Liat of Police Military was to captain the side, but was injured prior and was unable to play. The final score was 39–9. \nThe true local Singapore rugby story began in 1972 when the national team under the presidency of ASP Niaz Mohd Shah who led the charge to send a team made up of only of Singapore citizens to partake in the 3rd Asian Rugby Football Tournament in Hong Kong. The team was led by Leow Kim Liat and performed credibly with a 4th placing result. \nIn 1975, the Singapore National team took part in the SEAP Games in Bangkok and emerged 3rd winning a bronze medal. In 1977, under the presidency of renowned lawyer, Mr Howard Cashin, Singapore, as an all citizens national team, took part in the SEA Games held at Kuala Lumpur and emerged runner up with a silver medal.\nThe national team's best season was in 1978 when they beat the Singapore-based 1st RNZIR battalion team in the semi-finals of the MRU Cup competition played in Kuala Lumpur, and then went on to win the grand final. Later in the same year, also in Kuala Lumpur at the 6th Asian Rugby Football Tournament, the Singapore all-Asian nationals team emerged third in Asia against all odds, after Japan and Korea. They defeated Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand in the run up to the third placing.\nFor the stellar performance in 1978, the Singapore National Olympic Council awarded national sports accolades to Singapore rugby. The Singapore all-nationals team won the 1978 Team of the Year award, the Coach of the Year went to rugby coach, Natahar Bava and Sportsman of the Year went to the pack leader, Song Koon Poh. This was a \"Grand Slam\" achievement by the game of rugby in the history of sport in Singapore.\nThe MRU Cup victory feat was repeated again in 1982, and again the team was coached by Natahar Bava. Likewise, the 7s game also flourished in Singapore from 1977 to 1982. The Singapore all-nationals team played in the ever popular Hong Kong 7s in 1978, emerging as Plate finalists. In 1979, the team qualified for the cup quarter finals for first time ever but eventually lost out to Western Samoa. In 1980 Singapore again qualified for the plate finals. In spite of all the adversities encountered, these achievements by local rugby and the SRU then were momentous indeed and showed that local rugby did flourish in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n1990s to 2009.\nSingapore rugby did not maintain the same levels of achievement into the 1990s. After a heavy defeat at the hands of Hong Kong in 1995, the SRU decided to appoint a full-time officer and four part-time development officers, and instituted a schools programme. Between 1995 and 1998, over a hundred schools took up the sport.\nSingapore competed in the Asian Rugby Championship divisional tournaments starting in 1998, playing in a round-robin with Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. The Singapore's sevens team began playing in the Commonwealth Sevens with the inaugural tournament being held in Kuala Lumpur in 1998, and the team continued to compete in the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.\nThe Singapore Sevens tournament was set up as a standby for the Hong Kong Sevens, should it have declined under Chinese rule. It formed part of the IRB World Sevens Series in 2002, and from 2004 to 2006 before being replaced on the tour by the 2007 Adelaide Sevens.\n2010 onwards.\nThe SRU hosted the inaugural World Club 10s rugby tournament in 2014 at the new National Stadium, with eight international club teams competing. The Auckland Blues, captained by Piri Weepu, defeated the ACT Brumbies after double extra time by 10–5 to win the first title.\nThe Singapore Sevens tournament returned as an official event within the Asian Sevens Series in 2013, before a four-year deal was secured to host a leg of the Sevens World Series in Singapore again starting from the 2015–16 season.\nWhen Japan's Sunwolves team gained admission to the Super Rugby competition for the 2016 season, they agreed to host some of their home matches in Singapore at the National Stadium.\nCompetitions.\nDomestic Rugby.\nSenior men's competitions:\nSchools Rugby.\nJunior men's competitions are played by schools over three age groups:\n2019 Rugby World Cup.\nAt the 2019 Rugby World Cup to be hosted by Japan, in addition to the nine venues located in that country, one venue each from Singapore and Hong Kong have also been proposed to host five matches respectively. The Singapore Sports Hub, the successor to the National Stadium, with a capacity of 50,000, will be used for this purpose.\nSingapore rugby referees.\nSingapore rugby referees have performed notably on the international stage, despite the small rugby playing population. They have been appointed to referee at international events like the Hong Kong Sevens, Asian Games, and the Commonwealth Games, as well as at top Asian test matches such as Hong Kong vs Japan.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "Rugby union in Paraguay is a secondary sport. With 4,355 registered players and twenty clubs, the country currently ranks 37th worldwide and 4th in South America.\nThe Paraguayan Rugby Union (Union de Rugby del Paraguay) was founded in 1970, and joined the IRB in 1989.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded game of rugby in the country was in the 1930s, between players from Cerro Porteño and Olimpia (the country's two biggest football clubs). Further development of the game was sporadic.\nAsuncion Rugby Club, the country's first official rugby club, was formed in the late 1960s by two Britons, two Argentines, a Dutchman, and a New Zealander. They played informal games in the Jardin Botanico (Botanic Gardens of Asuncion) and travelled to Argentina for games.\nIn 1970 a second club was set up in Asuncion, the Club Universitario de Asunción (CURDA). Further clubs were established in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe sport's governing body, the Paraguayan Rugby Union (Union de Rugby del Paraguay), was founded in 1970 and joined the IRFB in 1989.\nThe traditional stronghold of Paraguayan rugby has been the capital, Asuncion, where the majority of clubs have been based. However Since 2000 a number of Asuncion clubs have folded, combined, or struggled to field teams in both Primera (First Grade of the Paraguayan Rugby Union Championship) and Intermedia (reserve grade).\nIn 2013 the teams in Primera were all from Asuncion: CURDA, San Jose, Old King Club, Luque, Cristo Rey, Universidad Autonoma de Asuncion, and Santa Clara.\nLas Leones de Encarnacion, from the south of the country, competed in Primera until 2009 when they switched to compete in the URNE championship of Northern Argentina. Encarnacion is a riverside city opposite the Argentine city of Posadas. Las Leones often fielded a strong team in Primera, but they are closer to the Posadas, Corrientes and Resistencia, than to Asuncion (a 5-hour bus trip). While strong at home they often struggled to field a competitive team when traveling to Asuncion every second week for Primera. They have since won the URNE championship.\nSince 2010 there has been strong growth in both women's rugby and rugby outside of and in the outskirts of Asuncion. Traditionally teams such as Ciudad del Este and Coronel Oviedo played only occasionally, or fielded a team in Intermedia or Primera where they often struggled. In 2010 a separate \"Campeonato del Interior\" was established, in which developing clubs from the countryside played. Teams include Santani, Coronel Oviedo, Villarica, Ciudad del Este and Presidente Franco.\nAll Primera teams are now obliged to field a women's team. The women play 7-a-side rugby with mini 7 a side championships held every couple of weeks.\nFrom 2013 a separate Campeonato Metropolitano (Metropolitan Championship) was also established, for new developing teams from Asuncion which could not yet compete in Primera. Teams include San Lorenzo, Capiata, Asuncion, and Sajonia.\nDivisions.\nTraditionally Paraguayan rugby clubs have fielded teams in Primera and/or Intermedia.\nIn recent years a Campeonato del Interior (Countryside Club Championship) and Campeonato Metropolitano (Metropolitan Championship) have been formed for developing clubs and clubs in rural areas.\nPrimera Teams also usually field Under 18, Under 16, Under 14 and Junior teams, and, as of recently, women's rugby teams.\nParaguayan Rugby Clubs.\nThere are several former clubs which no longer exist, such as Los Cuervos, Jabalí and Yakaré.\nWomen's rugby.\nAs mentioned above, women's rugby in Paraguay involves the teams from Primera fielding Seven-a-side teams. To play in Primera teams are obliged to field a women's team, which has spurred on the development of the sport for women.\nThe teams involved are CURDA, San Jose, Cristo Rey, Santa Clara, Universidad Autonoma de Asuncion, Old King Club, and Luque.\nOld King Club has dominated women's rugby in Paraguay, winning every women's championship and providing the bulk of the Paraguayan Women's Seven-a-side team. Both Old King Club and the National Women's Team are coached by Victor Velilla.\nAlthough Paraguay's women have not yet played a full 15 a sive test match, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2004. In 2013 they came 8th and last in the CONSUR South American Women's Sevens Championship.\nParaguayans Playing Abroad.\nSeveral Paraguayans have played overseas.\nIn France, Cesar Meilike, Jatar Fernandez, Fabio Franco and Emiliano Arnau played for Strasbourg, and José Otaño and Joel Orihuela for US CENAC, at Fédérale 2, and Freddy Lares and Miguel Jara for Houilles Carrilies at Fédérale 3.\nIn Germany several Paraguayans have played in Bundesliga 1 including Juan Caba Cabañas, Fabio Franco, Willians Portillo and Oscar Merino.\nIn Spain Willians Portillo (Madrid), Javier Morinigo (San Cugat – Barcelona, ex-Albertong de Sudafrica), Igor Huerta (Universidad de Málaga), Jorge Ocampo (CEU Rugby Barcelona) and Emiliano Arnau (Rugby Lavila) have played.\nDiego Sotelo and Gonzalo Sanches played College Rugby Division 1 in the United States.\nAlex Sharman is an Australian-born naturalized Paraguayan who played for Paraguay and the University of Sydney (NSW, Australia), Falkirk (Scotland), Hinckley and Clifton Rugby Clubs (England), St. Louis Ramblers (USA) and Rugby La Vila (Spain).\nFor several reasons these overseas players often aren't available to play for Paraguay, but in 2009 Joel Orihuela and Juan Cabanas returned to South America for the South American Championships in Montevideo, and in 2010 Jose Otano, Diego Sotelo played for Paraguay in the South American Championship in Santiago de Chile."

The current Malawi National Team (MARU) and Ndirlande Impala Rugby Club in Blantyre are sponsored by MeProjector.com. Albeit, Rugby in Malawi has frequently been haphazard, for example, Blantyre RFC once undertook a tour to Mauritius. Writing back to approve the tour, the Mauritian secretary added, \"Please bring your own ball. We have lost ours.\"\nGoverning body.\nAlthough the Nyasaland Union (as it was then) was founded in 1922. Malawi has not joined the IRB. Rugby has recently been reintroduced to Malawi with the game widely played in the South and the Center. The Rugby Football Union of Malawi (MARU) has set up structures that have helped in getting Malawi back into the international fold with Rugby Africa.\nHistory.\nAs with many African and Asian countries, rugby has been linked to the fortunes of British colonialism. Rugby was introduced by the British, and declined on independence. It also suffered from the problems of racial segregation. This meant that it did not achieve the popularity it should have done amongst native black Malawians and is still dominated by whites and ex-pats mainly in and around Blantyre.\nA regular competition was held against Beira in the Woury Cup during the period. Many of the competitions were against other British colonies in that part of Africa.\nWorld War II saw many players called away to the British Forces, and greatly depleted its resources.\nHowever, the game was still played to a large degree in the period between the end of the war, and Malawi's independence. The Leslie Sevens were played for many years after 1948, and the Grainger Cup from 1946, was the league for Malawian clubs.\nMalawi National Team plan to host a Tri-Nation’s Tournament in September 2022. Against Mozambique, and Tanzania.\nThere were tours in the '80s and '90s to Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nNational team.\nThe Nyasaland national rugby union team is now defunct, and there has not yet been a replacement Malawian team. It played some games in the 1930s. With Malawi now back into the international fold, the first training squad was selected for tests against Swaziland and Lesotho in May 2015.\nMARU are determined to attend Lesotho in 2022.\nMalawi National Team Jersey 2021/22, sponsored by MeProjector.com\nExternal links.\n\"Islam and Rugby\" on the \"Rugby Readers review\""

        "text": "Rugby union in Morocco is a significant and popular sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe Royal Moroccan Rugby Federation was formed in 1916, joined the IRFB in 1988. Morocco is a founding member of the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR), which was launched in January 1986.\nHistory.\nRugby came to Morocco in the early 20th century, mainly by the French protectorate in the country. As a result, Moroccan rugby was tied to the fortunes of France during the two world wars, with many Moroccan players going away to fight. Like many other Maghrebi nations, Moroccan rugby tended to look to Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa.\nThe game became more firmly established in the 1950s, partly through the efforts of Mohammed Benjaloun, who would become president of the Moroccan Olympic Committee. For a while, Morocco originally came under European rugby auspices, but is now integrated into the African structure.\nNational team.\nMorocco traditionally sees neighbours Spain as their rivals. Morocco played its first international in 1931 against them. After playing several games, they would not play another international until 1967, when they joined the European Nations Cup and FIRA. Morocco made the first division in 1983 but was beaten easily by France and Romania. After falling down the rankings, Morocco left the European series and joined the African Cup competition and won it in 2003 and 2005.\nTheir sevens side is regularly plays in the top circuit, doing very well in Hong Kong.\nThe link with France has proven to be a mixed blessing. On the one hand, several successful Moroccan players go on to play in the French leagues; on the other, some Moroccans have ended up playing for France, or refusing Moroccan caps in case they are ineligible for this. An example of this is, Abdelatif Benazzi, a forward who played for the French club of Agen and played 77 games for France.\nNotable Moroccan players include:"

By 1891 Samuel was playing for first class club Swansea, and on 7 March was selected to represent Wales against Ireland as part of the 1891 Home Nations Championship. The game saw an influx of Swansea players into the squad, with first caps for Tom Deacon, David James, Samuel's brother John as well as Samuel himself. After losses in the first two games of the tournament against Scotland and England, Wales achieved a narrow win over Ireland to avoid ending bottom of the table. Samuel was at the centre of the match scoring a vital try, which was converted by Billy Bancroft. Despite the success of the Welsh team against Ireland, Samuel was replaced the next season by Swansea teammate Frank Mills.\nIn 1893 the Welsh team had achieved early success in the Home Nations Championship. The Welsh selectors had decided to keep faith with a fairly static squad, which had achieved success with wins over both England and Scotland. Under the captaincy of Welsh rugby superstar Arthur Gould, Wales faced Ireland at Stradey Park in the hope of winning their first Triple Crown Championship. Samuel was the only change to the Welsh squad after the win away to Scotland, brought in to replace Harry Day.

        "text": "The men's basketball team representing the University of Kentucky plays at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Kentucky Wildcats originally did not play within any athletic conference, before joining the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1910. In 1921 they joined the newly established Southern Conference. Eleven years later they would join the SEC as a founding member. The Wildcats play their home games in Rupp Arena, named after their 16th head coach Adolph Rupp. They previously played in Memorial Coliseum, Alumni Gymnasium, Buell Armory Gymnasium, and began their existence playing in State College Gymnasium.\nThere have been 22 head coaches in the history of Kentucky basketball. The program has played over 3,100 games across 113 seasons from the program's inaugural 1903–04 season to the most recent year, 2022–23. Five Kentucky coaches, the most of any school, have led the team to a NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship: Rupp in 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1958; Joe B. Hall in 1978, Rick Pitino in 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, and John Calipari in 2012. Kentucky also received two retroactive national championships for the 1932-33 and 1933–34 teams coached by Rupp given by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll and Helms Athletic Foundation respectively. Seven coaches have won a conference regular season championship by having the best overall regular season record with the Wildcats: Ray Eklund, Rupp, Hall, Eddie Sutton, Pitino, Smith and Calipari. Seven coaches have won a conference tournament with the Wildcats: George Buchheit, Rupp, Hall, Sutton, Pitino, Smith and Calipari. \nRupp had the longest tenure at Kentucky, coaching for 42 seasons, and is the all-time leader in games coached (1,066) and wins at the school (874). Rupp's 874 wins were the most of any NCAA men's Division I coach at the time of his retirement in 1972. Eklund is the team's all-time leader in winning percentage, with a .833 winning percentage. Statistically, Basil Hayden has been the least successful coach of the Wildcats, with a winning percentage of .187. Five coaches have received national coaching awards while the head coach of Kentucky: Rupp, Sutton, Pitino, Smith, and Calipari. Four Wildcat coaches: Rupp, Sutton, Pitino, and Calipari have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. \nKentucky's previous head coach was John Calipari, who has held the position until 2024.\nStatistics.\n\"Statistics are correct as of the 2021–22 college basketball season.\"\n\"Coaching awards are only listed if won while the individual was the coach of Kentucky.\" "

The Beavers were coached by LaVonda Wagner. The Beavers are a member of the Pacific-10 Conference and competed in the Women's National Invitation Tournament. Oregon State finished the 2008-09 season with a 20-12, the team's most victories since the 1994-95 season.\nRegular season.\nEntering the year, OSU was selected to finish eighth by both the league's coaches and media. The Beavers were 9-9 in Pacific-10 Conference games, finishing in a tie for fourth place. The nine wins were their most wins in league since the 2001-02 season. Oregon State was 13-3 in home games, 6-6 in games played on the road and 1-3 in neutral site contests.\nOregon State won 11 non-conference games, which is the most for a Beavers' team since the club joined the Pac-10 more than 20 years ago. Oregon State went 6-0 in the month of December, the first time the team ever accomplished that. It also marked the longest win streak for Oregon State since the 2000-01 season.\nPlayer stats.\nBrittney Davis scored in double figures in the last 17 games straight. Of the Beavers' 32 games in 2008-09, she reached at least 10 points in 24. Talisa Rhea set the Pacific-10 Conference single-game record for three-pointers with 10 in the season opener against Sacramento State. She finished the game with 42 points, which is tied for fifth-most in school history. Rhea also had 64 three-pointers in 2008-09, the third-most in a single season. After just two seasons, she has made 131 three-pointers, which is second-most by an Oregon State player. As a team, the Beavers shot .744 from the free-throw line, a school record. That surpassed the previous best, set in 2004-05, of .734.\nPostseason.\nWomen’s National Invitation Tournament.\nOregon State made its second trip to the WNIT under head coach LaVonda Wagner and the sixth since the 2001 season.

Carol Menken holds the school record for points in a WNIT game with 33 against Drake in 1980.\nDavis scored her last collegiate three-pointer with 7.2 seconds remaining to pull the Beavers to within three points, making the score 59-56. The shot, a running jumper from way beyond the three-point line, came just seconds after New Mexico nailed two free throws.\nAwards and honors.\nApril 25: The Oregon State women's basketball team held its annual banquet at the Club (level) at Reser.

        "text": "Broadmoor Golf Club is a private golf club in the northwest United States in Seattle, Washington, founded in 1924 and opened for play in April 1927. It is located in the Broadmoor neighborhood of Seattle, just south of the University of Washington and west of Lake Washington.\nBroadmoor is a tribute to designer/builder A. Vernon \"Mac\" Macan, a leading golf course architect of the time. Born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1882, Macan was a highly educated man, attending Shrewsbury and studying law at Trinity College. In 1908, Macan emigrated to Canada, and was the architect for many golf courses in British Columbia and the northwestern U.S., including Royal Colwood, Inglewood, Fircrest, Columbia Edgewater, Hillcrest, and Colwood National.\nGolf history hosted at Broadmoor over the years includes the $10,000 Seattle Open in 1945 with Byron Nelson, Jug McSpaden, Ben Hogan, and Sam Snead. Nelson took the tournament with a new world's record of 259 for 72 holes, 21 under par, and a victory margin of thirteen strokes. He won a record eighteen tournaments in 1945, including eleven consecutive.\nIn 1952 at the LPGA Tour's Seattle Weathervane tournament, Betsy Rawls bested Babe Zaharias. In 1954, the 52nd Western Amateur brought Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, and Phil Harris to the course. In 1961, Broadmoor hosted the 13th annual U.S. Girls' Junior and the revival of the Seattle Open, where Dave Marr shot a final round 63 (–7) and birdied the first playoff hole \nWith the Seattle World's Fair, the Seattle Open in September 1962 attracted Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Tony Lema, Ken Venturi, Dave Hill, Julius Boros, Doug Sanders, along with Hollywood stars Bob Hope, James Garner, Don Cherry, Dennis Morgan and Phil Crosby, and a crowd of 6,000 for the pro-am. The tournament was won that year by 22-year-old rookie Jack Nicklaus, his second victory as a professional, following his playoff win over Palmer at the U.S. Open in June. Nicklaus had won $50,000 in the exhibition World Series of Golf the week before, and won in Portland the following week for his third tour title. The Seattle Open was held for the last time at Broadmoor in 1964 and Billy Casper claimed the winner's circle; the tournament continued for two more years, at Inglewood and Everett.\nThe U.S. Women's Amateur in 1974 brought winner Cynthia Hill (of the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado), Nancy Lopez, and Amy Alcott.\nMore recently, Broadmoor hosted the Pac-10 championship in 1989 and 1999, when Paul Casey of Arizona State lowered the course record to 60 (–10). The current record was set sixteen years later in 2015 by Seattle native Fred Couples, with a round of 59 (–11) in August."

In the Test series, Bangladesh recorded only its second and third Test wins ever, its first and second Test wins as the touring side, its first series win as the touring side, and its first Test series whitewash.

        "text": "The Big East Conference Men's Basketball Freshman of the Year, known as Big East Conference Men's Basketball Rookie of the Year from 1989 to 2015, is a Rookie of the Year award given annually by the Big East Conference to one or more men's basketball players in their first year of competitive play. It was first awarded by the original Big East Conference at the end of its inaugural 1979–80 season. When the conference split along football lines in 2013, the seven schools of the original Big East that did not play FBS football joined with three other schools and formed a new Big East Conference, with the FBS schools remaining in the former Big East structure under the new name of American Athletic Conference (The American). While both offshoot conferences claim the same 1979 starting date and administrative history, the athletic history of the original league is claimed only by the current Big East.\nThe award, like the other conference awards, is voted on by conference coaches. Coaches are not permitted to vote for players on their teams. The recipient of the award is announced at a press conference immediately preceding the Big East men's basketball tournament, at the same time as the Big East Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year and the Scholar-Athlete of the Year awards. The ceremony takes place at Madison Square Garden during the tournament. The most recent award recipient was Cam Whitmore of Villanova University.\nThe award was introduced following the conference's first season in 1980, awarded to David Russell of St. John's. Until the 1988–89 season, the award was known as the \"Freshman of the Year\"; from then through the 2014–15 season, it was known as \"Rookie of the Year\", and first-year transfers were eligible for the award alongside freshmen. The award once again became \"Freshman of the Year\" in 2016, with eligibility restricted to freshmen. The award has been shared twice—first after the 2004–05 season by Rudy Gay and Jeff Green, and again after the 2007–08 season by Jonny Flynn and DeJuan Blair. As such, the award has been presented 40 times. As only freshmen are eligible (with first-year transfers also eligible from 1989–2015), it is impossible to win the award more than once. However, the coaches in the conference also award a Preseason Rookie of the Year to one or more players before the start of the NCAA basketball season.\nWinners by school.\nGeorgetown University leads the award count as of 2023 with seven. The Big East split into two conferences in July 2013. One of the leagues, which initially included only schools that do not sponsor FBS football, retained the Big East name. This group of schools, whose core members are collectively known as the \"Catholic 7\", includes Georgetown. The other league, which was made up entirely of FBS football schools until non-football school Wichita State University joined in 2017, maintains the charter of the original Big East but now operates as the American Athletic Conference. The University of Connecticut, which initially remained in the renamed conference before rejoining in 2020, has the second most winners, with five. Only 13 of the 23 teams that have participated in Big East Conference men's basketball have had players win the Rookie of the Year award. Member schools which have never won the award include Providence College (in the current Big East), Rutgers University (which left The American for the Big Ten Conference in 2014), the University of Louisville (which left The American for the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2014), the University of South Florida (now in The American), and two schools which joined the current Big East from other conferences in 2013: Butler University and Xavier University. Schools which left the Big East without winning the award include the University of Miami, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia University. Boston College was a founding member in 1979, and left the Big East for the ACC in 2005. Because the college basketball season spans the new year, the year awarded is the year in which that season ended."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2010)",
        "text": "The 2010 Royal Rumble was the 23rd annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on January 31, 2010, at the Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2010 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship, or the ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXVI—this was the last Royal Rumble in which the ECW Championship was an option as the ECW brand was disbanded in February, also deactivating the title, thus also being WWE's last PPV to include the ECW brand.\nSix professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main event was the 2010 Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from all three brands. SmackDown's Edge, the twenty-ninth entrant, won the match by last eliminating Raw's John Cena, the nineteenth entrant. The primary match on the Raw brand was for the WWE Championship between reigning champion Sheamus and Randy Orton, which Sheamus won by disqualification. The primary match on the SmackDown brand was between The Undertaker and Rey Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship, which The Undertaker won to retain the championship. The featured match on the ECW brand was between Christian and Ezekiel Jackson for the ECW Championship, which Christian won to retain.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2010 event was the 23rd event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 31, 2010, at the Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2010, the winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship, or the ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXVI.\nStorylines.\nThe event included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"ECW\".\nOn the December 15, 2009, episode of \"ECW\", general manager Tiffany announced that the ECW brand would host a competition called the \"ECW Homecoming\", where the winner would face Christian for the ECW Championship at the Royal Rumble. Featuring current and former wrestlers from the ECW brand, the first round of the competition consisted of eight singles matches. The winners would then qualify to the \"Homecoming Finale\" on the January 12, 2010, episode, where they would fight in an eight-man battle royal that will determine the competition winner. The first two qualifying matches were featured later that night with Ezekiel Jackson defeating Vladimir Kozlov and Kane defeating Zack Ryder. The following week, Jack Swagger returned in a losing effort to Yoshi Tatsu, while Vance Archer advanced with a victory over Goldust. On the December 29 episode, Matt Hardy and Evan Bourne defeated Finlay and Mike Knox, respectively, to qualify. The two remaining qualifying matches were held on the January 5, 2010, episode of and saw Shelton Benjamin defeating Chavo Guerrero Jr. and CM Punk defeating Mark Henry to qualify. Ezekiel Jackson won the \"Homecoming Finale\", last eliminating Kane, to earn the right to face Christian at the Royal Rumble.\nOn the January 4 episode of \"Raw\", a fatal four-way match was held to determine the number one contender for WWE United States Championship featuring Montel Vontavious Porter, Mark Henry, Carlito, and Jack Swagger. Porter emerged victorious by pinning Swagger, and earned a match against The Miz for the championship.\nIt was announced on December 31, 2009, on the company's official website that The Undertaker would be defending the World Heavyweight Championship at the Royal Rumble; the means of determining the challenger was stated to be via the \"Beat the Clock Sprint\", a series of matches that sees who ever wins their match in the fastest time would be declared the number-one contender. The sprint, held on the January 1, 2010, episode of \"SmackDown\", consisted of four matches involving CM Punk, Kane, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Dolph Ziggler, R-Truth, Matt Hardy, and Batista. The wrestler who won his match in the quickest time would earn the championship match. Punk defeated Hardy in his match, setting the time at 7:20. The next match featured Kane and Ziggler; both failed to beat the time limit and the match ended in a draw. Mysterio defeated his former rival Jericho one second faster than Punk's time, with 7:19. The final match was Batista versus R-Truth; the match resulted in another time-limit draw, due in part to interference from Mysterio. Despite Mysterio's fastest time, on-screen consultant Vickie Guerrero overruled the result, announcing a match the following week between Mysterio and Batista, who had disputably won his match. The match between the two on the January 8 episode of \"SmackDown\" was declared a no contest following both men being incapacitated. A rematch between the two was held the following week, this time as a Steel Cage match. Mysterio won the match, earning the right to face The Undertaker at the Royal Rumble.\nThe main event for \"Raw\" was determined on the January 11 episode with guest host Mike Tyson announcing the winner of a triple threat match later that night between John Cena, Kofi Kingston, and Randy Orton would advance to face Sheamus at the Royal Rumble for the WWE Championship. Orton ultimately won with the help of Legacy, who took out Cena and Kingston for him.\nSince November of the previous year, WWE Women's Champion Michelle McCool had been relentlessly insulting Mickie James over a perceived weight issue. The two had a match at , which saw McCool win, continuing the torment. James confronted McCool on the January 15 episode of \"SmackDown\" during a mocking monologue about James, leading to the champion assaulting her. It was also confirmed that day that McCool would defend her title again at the Royal Rumble against James.\nEvent.\nDark match.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, a dark match took place in which Gail Kim, Kelly Kelly, Eve Torres, and The Bella Twins (Nikki Bella and Brie Bella) defeated Maryse, Katie Lea Burchill, Jillian Hall, Alicia Fox, and Natalya in a 10-Diva tag team match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe event opened with Christian defending the ECW Championship against Ezekiel Jackson (accompanied by William Regal). Regal attempted to interfere but the referee noticed, ejecting Regal from ringside. Christian executed the Killswitch on Jackson to retain the title.\nNext, The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against Montel Vontavious Porter, a match that Theodore Long booked in a backstage segment. After MVP chased Miz into the ring, Miz pinned him with a small package to retain the title.\nAfter that, Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Sheamus dominated most of the match, targeting Orton's left arm. Sheamus attempted Pale Justice on Orton but Orton countered the move with a Rope Hung DDT. Orton pinned Sheamus but Sheamus touched the bottom rope, voiding the pinfall. Orton attempted a punt on Sheamus but Sheamus countered and targeted Orton's left arm. Cody Rhodes interfered and attacked Sheamus, meaning Sheamus retained the title by disqualification. After the match, Orton confronted and attacked Rhodes. Ted DiBiase came out but was also attacked by Orton. Sheamus attacked Orton with a Brogue Kick and celebrated his victory.\nNext, Michelle McCool defended the WWE Women's Championship against Mickie James. McCool was accompanied by Layla. Before the match began, McCool taunted James by calling her \"Piggy James\" and Layla wore a fat suit to mock James. As the match started, \"Piggy James\" Layla tried to attack the genuine James but McCool accidentally executed a Big Boot on Layla. James took advantage and executed a Mickie DDT to win the title.\nIn the penultimate match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Rey Mysterio. After countering a Last Ride, Mysterio executed two 619s on Undertaker. Mysterio attempted a West Coast Pop but Undertaker caught Mysterio and executed a Last Ride to retain the title.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania XXVI. Dolph Ziggler (#1) and Evan Bourne (#2) were quickly eliminated by CM Punk (#3). After eliminating both men, Punk began talking on the microphone, boasting of his intention to win, carrying this on for all of his time in the match. Punk quickly eliminated JTG (#4), before being stopped by The Great Khali (#5). Beth Phoenix then entered at #6, becoming only the second WWE Diva to participate in a Royal Rumble, after Chyna. Phoenix eliminated Khali by pulling him over the top rope while kissing him but was eliminated by Punk immediately afterwards. Triple H entered at #8 and eliminated Punk. Montel Vontavious Porter (#14) was attacked by The Miz during his ring entrance and taken backstage by medical personnel without entering the match. Miz then entered at #16 but Porter returned to the match and eliminated both himself and Miz. The other half of D-Generation X, Shawn Michaels, entered at #18 and he and Triple H eliminated all the other competitors in the match, leaving themselves. Michaels and Triple H were immediately joined by John Cena (#19). After double-teaming Cena, Michaels performed a Sweet Chin Music on Triple H to eliminate him. A notable moment in the match came when R-Truth (#25) eliminated Big Show (#22) and Mark Henry (#23) at the same time. Chris Jericho entered the ring at #28 and was soon joined by entrant #29, Edge, who was making his return following a six-month hiatus due to injury. Edge performed spears on Jericho, Michaels, and Cena before eliminating Jericho. Batista entered at #30 as the final entrant. This brought the final four down to Michaels, Cena, Edge, and Batista. After all four competitors traded moves on each other, Batista eliminated Michaels, who tried to rejoin the match but was stopped, resulting in him superkicking a referee before walking to the back frustrated.\nAfter a quick back and forth, Cena eliminated Batista, bringing the final two down to himself and Edge. Cena countered a spear attempt from Edge and went to eliminate him, but Edge instead eliminated Cena to win the match. In doing so, Edge would gain the new record of spending the least amount of time in the rumble match before winning it. He was in the match for 7 minutes and 37 seconds, besting the previous record set by Cena by 51 seconds. This record lasted for 12 years until it was broken by Brock Lesnar in 2022.\nReception.\nThe Royal Rumble received generally positive reviews from critics. The event earned 462,000 pay-per-view buys, an increase of 12,000 on the 2009 Royal Rumble.\nAftermath.\nAfter failing to win the Royal Rumble match and losing an Elimination Chamber qualifying match to Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels cost The Undertaker the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. As a result, Michaels challenged Undertaker to a rematch of their WrestleMania XXV match at WrestleMania XXVI. Undertaker agreed on the term that if Michaels lost, he would retire from professional wrestling. A stipulation was added that the match would be contested under no disqualifications and no countouts. At WrestleMania, Undertaker defeated Michaels to extend his WrestleMania winning streak to 18–0 and Michaels was forced to retire.\nAs a result of winning the 2010 Royal Rumble match, Edge earned the opportunity to wrestle for a world championship of his choosing at WrestleMania XXVI. After Chris Jericho won the World Heavyweight Championship from The Undertaker in an Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber, Edge announced that he would wrestle Jericho, whom Edge had shared the WWE Undisputed Tag Team Championships with at the time of his injury, for the title. At WrestleMania, Jericho defeated Edge to retain the title. After the match, Edge would be frustrated, spearing Chris Jericho through the barricade in the process at ringside. The rivalry ended after Edge defeated Jericho in a Steel Cage match at Extreme Rules.\nJohn Cena eliminated Batista from the Royal Rumble match, which started a conflict between Batista and Cena. On the February 1 episode of \"Raw\", Cena rescued Bret Hart from an assault by Batista and Vince McMahon. After the show ended, Cena tried to help Hart but was attacked by Batista. At Elimination Chamber, Cena won the WWE Championship from Sheamus in an Elimination Chamber match. After the match, McMahon ordered Cena to defend the title against Batista. Batista defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship. At WrestleMania XXVI, Cena defeated Batista to regain the WWE Championship. Cena would retain the title against Batista in a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules and in an \"I Quit\" match at Over the Limit, which forced Batista to quit WWE.\nAfter the Royal Rumble, Christian and Ezekiel Jackson continued to feud over the ECW Championship. On February 2, however, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced that \"ECW\" would be going off the air and would air its final episode on February 16. On the final episode of \"ECW\", Jackson, with the help of William Regal, defeated Christian in an Extreme Rules match to become the final ECW Champion. Afterwards, the ECW brand was discontinued, subsequently retiring the championship. This would in turn be the last Royal Rumble in which three titles were an option for the Royal Rumble winner until 2020."

The club's full name is Basquetebol do Clube de Regatas do Flamengo. The club's commonly used short names are C.R.F. Basquete, C.R. Flamengo Basquete, Flamengo Basquete, and FlaBasquete.\nFlamengo is one of the most traditional and successful basketball teams in Brazil, having won the top-tier level Brazilian National League title eight times, once during the Brazilian Basketball Championship era, and seven times during the NBB era (the current Brazilian League format). The team also won the South American second-tier level FIBA South American League (LSB) in 2009 (I), the Americas top-tier level FIBA Americas League in 2014 and Basketball Champions League Americas in 2021, and the FIBA Intercontinental Cup twice in 2014 and 2022.\nBrazil's senior national team's all time legend, Oscar Schmidt, played with Flamengo between 1999 and 2003, and is one of the most important players in the club's history.\nHistory.\nThe red and black basketball team won its first championship in club history in 1919, while playing in the championship of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The club also won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship in 1932. When the Rio de Janeiro State Championship was again won in 1933, the team was still undefeated. In 1934 and 1935 they won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship title again.\nArenas.\nHélio Maurício Gym (Gavea).\nHélio Maurício Gym nowadays is used only by the Flamengo Youth Basketball Team, but for a long time the gym received also the professional team matches, including matches of the National League\nThe gym is quite small, with a seating capacity of 800 people for basketball games. Due to the small capacity, traditionally the professional team used the Maracanãzinho, HSBC Arena, and Carioca Arena 1 when a bigger attendance is expected. The gym is part of the Gávea complex, that includes other two gyms, several tennis court, swimming pools, restaurants, bars, and the Gavea Stadium. Flamengo Basketball professional team later played their home matches at HSBC Arena.\nMaracanãzinho.\nGinásio do Maracanãzinho, sometimes called just Maracanãzinho, is a modern indoor arena that is located in Maracanã neighborhood, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Its formal name, Ginásio Gilberto Cardoso, honors a former Clube de Regatas do Flamengo president. The capacity of the arena is 11,800 for basketball games. It was opened in 1954. Located near the Maracanã Stadium, Maracanãzinho means \"Little Maracanã\".\nFor the 2007 Pan American Games, the gym was remodeled, with new central air conditioning, an added four-sided scoreboard, a new sound system, a dome which allows natural lighting during the day, new comfortable seating, and adaptions to all international requirements. As a result, the Maracanãzinho became a venue for the volleyball competitions of the 2007 Pan American Games, and many other international competitions. After the renovations, the capacity of the arena was reduced from approximately 13,000 to 11,800 spectators for futsal. The arena became more comfortable for spectators, as the field of vision was increased for better viewing of the arena floor.\nHSBC Arena.\nHSBC Arena indoor multi-purpose arena located in the neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The arena was completed in 2007, and has a seating capacity of 15,430 people for basketball games. It hosted the basketball and gymnastics events at the 2007 Pan American Games. In December 2007, the arena started being operated by GL Events, who also operates the nearby Riocentro Convention Center and the Riocentro Sports Complex, and started hosting music concerts from a various hand of artists.\nStarting 29 March 2008, the arena started to be called HSBC Arena, as part of a naming rights agreement with the bank.\nThe arena also started to receive Flamengo Basketball team in 2009, for the playoff's games of NBB League, and is the home of the team to the 09–10 season\nGinásio Álvaro Vieira Lima.\nFlamengo has also used the Ginásio Álvaro Vieira Lima as a home arena. It has a seating capacity of 3,000 people for basketball games. The arena has been often used as the home arena of Flamengo, of the Novo Basquete Brasil (NBB), during the regular season and early playoff rounds.\nThe arena is often referred to as the Ginásio do Tijuca Tênis Clube, in reference to the neighborhood that it's located in, and to its owner, Tijuca Tênis Clube of the top-tier level Brazilian NBB league.\nCarioca Arena 1.\nFlamengo has also used the Carioca Arena 1 as its home venue. It was constructed for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The arena originally had a seating capacity of 16,000 for the 2016 Olympics, but it was reduced to 6,000 after the Olympics.\nConstruction on the arena began in July 2013. The arena covers 38 thousand square meters. The arena's capacity for the 2016 Summer Olympics was 16,000 spectators. However, it was lowered to 6,000 after the Olympics. The facade has a height of 33 meters, and its shape is inspired by the mountainous landscape of the city. The track was built with two types of wood, one for a different track and to the surrounding area, as well as a system for absorbing blows of the sport. The arena has 282 rooms, 49 bathrooms, eight dressing rooms and six lifts.\nThe estimated cost for the planned complex of three arenas (Carioca 1, Carioca 2 and Carioca 3), the IBC, MPC, a hotel, and the structure of the Olympic Park was 1.678 billion Brazilian reais, including part of the public initiative and private money. This was handled between the Prefecture of Rio de Janeiro and the private sector.\nThe work was completed in January 2016. As a part of the arena's opening events, there was the Basketball Tournament International Women Aquece River, held from 15 to 17, January 2016, and the International Championship of Wheelchair Rugby Rio Aquece, held from 29 to 31 January 2016.\nPlayers.\nDepth chart.\n&lt;section end=depthchart /&gt;\nSeason by season.\n1Qualified but could not compete due to the suspension of the Brazilian Basketball Confederation by FIBA."

Hailing from Tondu, Strong's first sporting priority as a child was with the game of soccer, but eventually converting to the oval ball code, playing for Beddau RFC Under-16s (in Beddau).\nHaving played for Bridgend RFC at youth level, Nathan broke into the senior ranks with his local club Tondu RFC in 1996, and went on to captain the side. A brief spell with Caerphilly RFC, where was coaching at the time, precluded a return to Tondu RFC, from where representative honours were won with Glamorgan County. Following the watershed in Welsh rugby which occurred in 2003 with the advent of regionalism, Nathan followed a number of fellow Tondu RFC players down to the Brewery Field to represent Bridgend RFC.\nMaking a name for himself in the premiership as a highly physical back rower, Nathan went on to captain Bridgend RFC, and whilst playing rugby league for the Bridgend Blue Bulls, playing at , and was capped by Wales at amateur and senior level in the thirteen man code.\nIn the summer of 2005, Nathan, who is employed by Rockwool Insulation Ltd in Bridgend, transferred to Pontypridd RFC, offering the benefit of his experience and physicality to the young Pontypridd RFC squad.\nMaking a huge and immediate impact with the Sardis Road side, Nathan produced a series of barnstorming back row performances throughout the 2005 – 2006 campaign, crowned by the honour of lifting the Konica Minolta Welsh Cup as team captain. Having instantly become a great favourite with the Pontypridd RFC crowd, Nathan was voted Player of the Year 2006 by the Supporter's Club, a fitting tribute to his immense contribution during the season.\nIn the 2007 off-season, and following Dale McIntosh's departure to take up the reins as Forwards Coach, Nathan was charged with leading the team in the 2007/08 season as Club Captain.\nAfter 5 years at Pontypridd RFC, Nathan decided to depart from the club and joined Aberavon RFC for the 2010/11/12 season. Following a serious knee injury that kept him out of the game for a few seasons Nathan has returned to the game playing for his home town club, Tondu RFC. Nathan has represented the Classic lions in Bermuda and regularly plays in charity veterans tournaments around the globe.\nInternational honours.\nNathan Strong won caps for Wales while at Bridgend Blue Bulls 2004 2004(...2005?) 2-caps (interchange/substitute)."

        "text": "John Hammond (28 July 1860 – 21 November 1907) was an English rugby union forward who, although not capped for England, was part of three British Lions tours, all to South Africa. He gained three caps during the 1891 tour to South Africa and captained the 1896 tour, winning another two test caps. Although not part of the 1899 tour to Australia, he was made the manager of the 1903 tour. Despite captaining the British Isles, Hammond never represented England.\nEarly life.\nHammond was born in Skipton, Yorkshire in 1860 to James Hammond of Arncliffe. He was educated at Uppingham School and later Tonbridge School before being accepted into Trinity College, Cambridge in 1879, gaining a BA in 1883. He was called to The Bar in 1885, after taking an administrative legal role at Lincoln's Inn from 1880, whilst still an undergraduate.\nRugby career.\nHammond first came to note as a rugby player while at Cambridge where he played for Cambridge University and in 1881 won a Cambridge Blue in a Varsity match. In 1891, Hammond was selected for the first official British Isles tour. The tour to South Africa was very successful for the tourists, with the British team winning all three tests; Hammond played in all of them. five years later, and now a 36-year-old veteran, Hammond was selected for the second tour of South Africa. Hammond, now playing for Blackheath, was only one of two players to have played in a previous tour, the other being Froude Hancock. Hammond was given the captaincy of the British team for the 1896 tour, but only lead the team out for the second test, in Johannesburg, and the final test played in Cape Town. The deputy captain was Thomas Crean, who is often seen as the de facto leader of the British Isles tourists. Although losing the last test, the British team won the series 3–1; the last victory by the Lions in South Africa until 1974.\nIn 1903, a British team again toured South Africa. Led by Scotland's Mark Morrison, Hammond was selected as team manager. Although the tourists lost this series, Hammond's enthusiasm for South African rugby led to the IRB accepting the first touring South African team in their 1906 tour of Great Britain."

        "title": "Woodhall Spa Golf Club",
        "text": "Woodhall Spa Golf Club is a private golf club in England that is located to the north of Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire. The club was founded in 1891. In 1995 the club was purchased by the English Golf Union, who have since relocated their headquarters onto the site, which is now known as The National Golf Centre.\nWoodhall Spa has two golf courses. The original course, now known as ‘The Hotchkin’, which opened in 1905 and was originally laid out by Harry Vardon before being redesigned by Stafford Vere Hotchkin in the 1920s, and ‘The Bracken’, designed by Donald Steel which opened in 1998. The club has hosted many prestigious amateur championships including the English Amateur and the Brabazon Trophy on several occasions.\nHistory.\nGolf started at Woodhall Spa in 1890 when a nine-hole course opened for play. The club was founded in the following year. In 1902 landowner and member, Stafford Vere Hotchkin, offered an expanse of land off Horncastle Road for the building of an 18-hole golf course. The course remains on this site today. Harry Vardon was employed to design the course. The official opening took place on 30 June 1905 and included an exhibition match between Harry Vardon, James Braid and J.H. Taylor.\nHarry Colt redesigned the course between 1911 and 1914. \nIn 1919, following a distinguished military career during the First World War, Colonel Stafford Vere Hotchkin MC returned and took over the running of the club. He was an accomplished golf course architect in his own right and remodelled many of the holes during the 1920s adding seventeen new greens. Only one of the original greens was retained (the 6th) but this was approached from a different direction. The course as it stands today remains largely his original design. \nFollowing his death in 1953 his son Neil Hotchkin continued to run the course as a close-knit private members club where professionals had to be invited to play. He was a faithful supporter of amateur golf and served as President of the English Golf Union in 1972. He resided at Womersley House, a large detached property off Horncastle Road adjacent to the third tee. \nNeil Hotchkin wished to protect and secure the future of the club as a home for amateur golf. In 1995 he sold the club and course to the English Golf Union. The EGU built a second 18-hole course (‘The Bracken’) which opened for play in 1998. The original course was then renamed ‘The Hotchkin’.\nThe Hotchkin Course.\nThe course is set in heathland with sandy subsoil, extensive swathes of heather and mixed foliage including birch and pine. It is generally regarded as one of the finest inland golf courses in the British Isles. The Hotchkin is renowned for its well placed deep bunkers. The bunkers surrounding the greens at the fourth and twelfth holes are especially cavernous.\nAwards and Acclaim.\nThe Hotchkin course is often included in rankings of the best golf courses in the world. \"Golf Magazine\" and \"Golf Digest\" both rank the Hotchkin course as one of the top 100 courses in the world. \"Golf Magazine\" ranked the Hotchkin course as 61st best in the world in its rankings for 2021-22.\nTony Jacklin's formative years were spent in Lincolnshire and although he often played the Hotchkin course, both as an amateur and professional golfer, he never managed to score better than 70. Jacklin once told his friend Tom Weiskopf that at the outset of his golfing career he had three specific ambitions: \"To win the Open Championship, to win the US Open and to break 70 at Woodhall Spa\". Jacklin then said \"Two out of three ain't bad!\"\nWeiskopf went on to become a highly regarded golf course designer and later admitted he always tried to incorporate aspects of the Hotchkin course into his own designs. \"Tony Jacklin took me there once and I fell in love with the place. Now when I'm designing a course I try to remember something subtle from Woodhall, the fold of the land, the bunkering – even the fact that you can always see the top of the flagstick. There’s a bit of Woodhall Spa in every course I build\".\nIn 1972 the golfing correspondent David Davies reflected:\n\"Give several golfers seven days to live and the opportunity to play, for the last time, seven difficult golf courses in that week, and it is fairly safe to say that Woodhall Spa would be on the list of ones who have played it. It is one of those courses that captivates instantly, and, better, improves with acquaintance. It is a course of great beauty and one of the finest tests of the game in the British Isles\".\nIt is a favourite course of Mark James, who won the English Amateur Championship when it was held at the club in 1974."

In March 2010, it hosted the University Golf Match between Oxford and Cambridge universities, with Oxford winning 9–6. The Senior Open Championship has been played here three times, in 2014, 2017, and 2023.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1891 by a group of businessmen from Cardiff, with the first nine-hole golf course being laid out on Lock's Common by Charles Gibson the following year. In 1895, the club moved to its present location with the addition of a further nine-hole course. Shortly after that, the new course was extended to eighteen holes, with the original course later being abandoned. Royal status was conferred on the club by Edward VII in 1909.\nThe Senior Open Championship was played at Royal Porthcawl in 2014 and Bernhard Langer won by thirteen strokes over runner-up Colin Montgomerie; it returned again in 2017, where Langer defeated Corey Pavin to win again.\nIn 2015, The R&amp;A championship committee chairman Peter Unsworth said that The R&amp;A had \"no intention\" of hosting The Open Championship at Royal Porthcawl. He added that \"We're happy with the number of courses on the rota, and we don't have any intention to go to Porthcawl\". It is thought that the infrastructure around Royal Porthcawl does not meet requirements, with roads leading to the course being narrow and that public transport would not cope with the huge crowds in the Open Championships."

The President of UBL was Mykhailo Brodskyy.\nHistory.\nUkrainian basketball League was created on 20 June 2008 as an alternative body to Ukrainian basketball Federation. The following key principles are put to the basis of UBL operation: sight, competition and openness. That is why today in UBL, as in NBA, the clubs are limited with their budget top margins, which guarantees to all teams the same and equal opportunities. Another key difference of UBL is “the course to Ukrainization” of domestic basketball. The Regulations of the League demand the presence on playing court a minimum of one Ukrainian player out of five. This approach gives an opportunity to involve Ukrainian stars in games and to stimulate investments in formation of domestic basketball schools. During the first year of its existence UBL had organized several arrangements that combined the sporting activities with elements of show, such as All-Star Game and UBL Cup Final Four."

MSU finished the season 28–9, 14–4 in Big Ten play to earn a share of the Big Ten regular season championship for the 12th time in school history. They lost to Minnesota in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 5 seed, their 13th consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament under Izzo. They defeated New Mexico State, Maryland, Northern Iowa, and Tennessee to advance to the Final Four. In the Final Four, the Spartans' sixth trip to the Final Four under Izzo, they lost to Butler.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2008–09 season 31–7, 15–3 in Big Ten play to win the Big Ten regular season championship. Michigan State received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 12th straight trip to the Tournament, and advanced to the National Championship game, their second trip to the title game under Tom Izzo, before losing to North Carolina.\nOffseason.\nThe Spartans lost Goran Suton (10.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game) to the NBA draft following the season.\nSeason summary.\nMichigan State was led by junior Kalin Lucas (14.8 points and 4 assists per game), senior Raymar Morgan (11.3 points and 6.2 rebounds per game), and sophomore Draymond Green (9.9 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3 assists per game). The Spartans began the season ranked No. 2 in the polls following their trip to the National Championship game in 2009. MSU competed in the Legends Classic and were upset by Florida in the semifinals. In the third place game, the Spartans routed UMass. MSU fell to again to No. 10 North Carolina in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge in a rematch of the prior year's National Championship game. The Spartans finished the non-conference schedule at 10–3, also losing at No. 2 Texas. The Spartans were ranked No. 11 in the country entering the Big Ten regular season.\nThe Spartans began the Big Ten season on fire, winning their first nine games, with wins over No. 25 Northwestern and No. 17 Wisconsin in the first two games. The winning streak ended with three straight losses to Wisconsin, Illinois, and No. 6 Purdue. The Spartans rebounded to finish 14–4 in Big Ten play and capture a share of the Big Ten regular season title. Michigan State completed the regular season at 24–7 and ranked 11th in the country.

In the Second Round, Lucas went down with a serious knee injury and the Spartans needed a three-point shot from Korie Lucious at the buzzer to advance past Maryland. Without Lucas for the remainder of the Tournament, MSU beat Northern Iowa and Tennessee to advance to their second consecutive Final Four and sixth in the last twelve years.

It was the fourth final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nThe match was Falkirk's first national cup final in 36 years since winning the Scottish Cup in 1957; whilst it was St Mirren's first in only six years since lifting the Scottish Cup in 1987. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier Division, with both finalists from the First Division.\nThe match was goalless after 45 minutes, but Falkirk took the lead two minutes into the second half with a goal from Neil Duffy and only one minute later were 2–0 up with a goal from Richard Cadette. The final goal of the game came from John Hughes, which was enough for Falkirk to win the match 3–0 and the tournament for the first time.\nRoute to the final.\nFalkirk.\nFalkirk faced neighbours Alloa Athletic at home in the first round with the home team producing a 2–1 victory. The second round draw saw Cowdenbeath travel to Brockville Park, in another home game for Falkirk with the team winning 3–0 to progress to the quarter-final. The reward for reaching the quarter-final was a third home game of the tournament against rivals Dunfermline Athletic with The Bairns emerging 4–1 winners. The semi-final opposition was Livingston, and a fourth consecutive home game at Brockville with Falkirk winning 3–2 to book a place in the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time.\nSt Mirren.\nSt Mirren faced a trip to Clyde in the first round which saw the team emerge 1–0 winners. The second round was another game on the road against Renfrewshire rivals Morton with The Saints producing a 4–2 victory to progress to the quarter-finals. A third away game of the tournament saw St Mirren travel to Airdrieonians, winning 1–0. The reward for reaching the semi-final was another away game with the opponents in the form of Ayr United at Somerset Park. St Mirren won 2–1 to book a place in the final. St Mirren reached the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time.\nPre-match.\nAnalysis.\nFalkirk played all of their games preceding the final at their home of Brockville Park, in the process scoring twelve goals and conceding four. On the other hand, St Mirren played all four of their games on the road with no matches played at their home of Love Street. Despite playing all of their games away from home, St Mirren scored eight goals and conceded only three, whilst keeping two clean sheets compared with Falkirk's one. This was the first appearance for both Falkirk and St Mirren in the Scottish Challenge Cup final since its inauguration in 1990."

        "text": "Hungary v El Salvador was the second game to be played in Group 3 of the first group stage at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. The game was played at Nuevo Estadio in Elche, Spain on 15 June between the men's national football teams of Hungary and El Salvador. Hungary won the match 10–1, recording the biggest scoreline in men's FIFA World Cup finals history. \nHungarian substitute László Kiss scored a hat-trick, the only World Cup hat-trick by a substitute, and the fastest ever in a World Cup, in the space of seven minutes.\nBackground.\nHungary had the experience of playing in the final of both the 1938 and 1954 World Cups. El Salvador's qualification for the World Cup was made when the country was in the throes of civil war.\nThe preparation of the Salvadorans for the World Cup was altered due to the war. They struggled to make friendlies and training sessions were frequently disrupted. According to the World Cup's technical report: El Salvador had a very good preparatory programme, mainly with emphasis on endurance, speed and strength. The program was very interesting, but as it happened, the special political circumstances in the country prevented the final stage from being carried out in as concentrated a way as one would have actually wished.\nPrior to the World Cup, El Salvador sent a 20-man squad (as opposed to a 22-man squad) for economic reasons. Hungary sent their full team. The Salvadoran team was the last team to arrive in Spain, arriving 3 days before the match against Hungary. On the eve of the game, the Salvadoran players watched a video of the Hungarian team in action, which was purchased from a Spanish agent.\nThe draw for the group stage of the 1982 World Cup paired Hungary and El Salvador with Argentina and Belgium in Group 3. Before the game, holders Argentina had lost 1–0 to Belgium in the opening game of the tournament. Despite this win, Hungary collected only one more point in the group stage and failed to qualify for the second round.\nThe win equalised with Yugoslavia 9–0 win over Zaire in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, with a nine-goal margin separating.\nAftermath.\nAfter the resounding victory, Hungary had a goal difference of +9 and was leading the group, as Belgium defeated Argentina by just one goal. In the next match, Hungary lost to Argentina by 4-1, and in order to qualify for the second phase, they needed to defeat Belgium. However, they only managed to draw 1-1, resulting in their elimination in the first round. Despite this, they finished above El Salvador, which only scored 1 goal and conceded 13 goals in 3 matches, placing the Central Americans at the bottom of the tournament's overall standings."

Lloyd was brought in on the wing, opposite Tom Pearson, as a temporary replacement for William Llewellyn Thomas. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales played a good game on a pitch shortened by 20 yards due to a large area of the pitch being frozen. The game finished 5-4 to Scotland, with Wales having a late try disallowed when Frank Mills' score was deemed to have been passed the taped off area. The next game, Thomas returned to the wing position and Lloyd was not selected to represent Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "Jackie Walker (born November 3, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He was the 28th player selected in the 1986 NFL draft, the first player drafted in the second round of a year in which there were only 27 first-round picks. His selection was controversial, as he did not score particularly well in the pre-draft combines, and there were more-heralded linebackers still on the board. Walker attended Carroll High School in Monroe, Louisiana. He was a latecomer to organized sports, not playing football until high school coaches and his older brother convinced him to join the team in his senior year of high school. A quick and aggressive player, he was a starter all four years at Jackson State University, where he also played power forward for the basketball team. In his senior year, he led the team with 131 tackles, was named to two All-American teams, and was named Southwestern Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. While the Buccaneers staff were impressed with his raw talent and saw him as a potential Ted Hendricks-type player, the fans were critical of the selection of a player with so little training and experience. Walker started only nine games for the Buccaneers, all in 1987. Although popular with teammates and a standout on special teams, he never worked his way into the regular lineup. Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins at one point toyed with the idea of taking advantage of his athleticism by converting him to tight end, but dropped the idea due to lack of interest from Walker. When Plan B free agency began in 1989, Walker was one of the players allowed to leave. He was signed by the New York Jets in 1989 after being left unprotected by the Buccaneers, but was cut from the Jets in training camp. He later played for the Cincinnati Rockers, Miami Hooters, and Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League.\nAwards.\nSouthwestern Athletic Conference most valuable defensive player, 1985&lt;br&gt;\n1st Team All-American, 1985"

He was also an alternate on the United States team for the 1968 Olympics. He transferred to North Texas State in 1968 and was a two-time All-Missouri Valley Conference Player.\nProfessional career.\nHamilton was selected in the ninth round (152 overall) of the 1970 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks. He was also picked in the fourth round of the 1970 American Basketball Association Draft by the Texas Chaparrals and signed with the ABA team.\nHe scored 1,318 points in 84 games (15.7 points per game) during the 1970–71 ABA season and made the ABA All-Rookie team. He stayed with the team for the next three seasons (as it became the Dallas Chaparrals and then San Antonio Spurs). \nHe next played for the Kentucky Colonels but was cut 9 games into the 1974–75 season. Though he was contacted by his former Spurs coach Tom Nissalke to rejoin the team, Nissalke was fired soon after. He was then offered a minimum salary contract by the Memphis Sounds but the ABA veteran turned it down.\nHe instead played for the Munich Eagles of the European Professional Basketball League. Though he was the league top scorer with 24 points per game (along with a league second-best 4 assists), the league folded in April 1975 with Hamilton still owed part of his salary.\nHe was signed by Nissalke, now coach of the Utah Stars, in late 1975 but was traded ten days later to the newly formed Baltimore Claws. The Claws reportedly ran out of money (with Hamilton stating the players \"couldn't even get meal money\") and folded three days before the 1975–76 ABA season. He returned to the Utah Stars and played the start of the season with them. However the Stars would themselves fold in December 1975. After these bad breaks, Hamilton retired from basketball at 27 to work as district salesman for a basketball shoe manufacturer in Chicago. The married father of two preferred the security of a stable job over an offer to play in the semi-pro Eastern League."

His team made it to the NCAA Division II Elite Eight. Perry earned a bachelor's degree in business administration.\nCoaching career.\nPerry started his coaching career in 1988 at the University of Detroit Mercy, where he spent five seasons. He went on to become an assistant coach at The University of Michigan, where he was instrumental in guiding the team to the NCAA Division I Elite Eight in 1994. Perry was the catalyst for Michigan's nationally recognized top-ranked recruiting classes in both 1994 and 1995. His final year with the Wolverines resulted in a NIT Championship. Perry completed his coaching career as the head coach at Eastern Kentucky University from 1997 to 2000.\nExecutive career.\nPerry was hired as a front office executive for the Detroit Pistons by president Joe Dumars in June 2000.

He then returned to the Pistons to become vice president of basketball operations from 2008 to 2012.\nOn June 25, 2012, Perry was hired by the Orlando Magic general manager Rob Hennigan to become Hennigan's vice president and assistant general manager. ESPN basketball analyst and former NBA player Chauncey Billups spoke highly of Perry as the assistant general manager of the Magic, saying, \"I love Scott Perry in the front office.\" In his time in Orlando, Perry helped draft Victor Oladipo (2013), Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton (2014), and Mario Hezonja (2015).\nOn April 21, 2017, Perry was hired by the Sacramento Kings as vice president of basketball operations. Three months later, on July 14, 2017, Perry was hired to become the general manager of the New York Knicks. As compensation for the movement, the Knicks gave the Kings a 2019 second round pick and cash considerations, with the Kings later hiring Brandon Williams as his replacement. On February 4, 2020, Perry took over basketball operations duties on an interim basis after president Steve Mills was fired."

For six years it hosted the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, a match play tournament on the PGA Tour and the European Tour in late February. The club was known as Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, carrying co-branding from Ritz-Carlton, which operates the hotel facilities at the club, from its opening until 2012; however the co-branding was removed before the 2013 event for unknown reasons.\nDesigned by Jack Nicklaus, the course holds the distinction for being the longest venue in PGA Tour history at ; the average elevation is approximately above sea level. The club boasts the designation as a Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course with 27 holes. In an effort to preserve and protect the surrounding lush desert, club makes use of numerous \"green\" technologies. Efforts include everything from using reclaimed water for the courses and landscaping to preservation of natural washes as havens for wildlife.\nThe course's green complexes were heavily criticized by players during the 2009 event, the first to be played on the course, due to their subtleties and the effects of various natural landforms on the pull of the breaks. This led to several top names demanding the reconfiguration of the greens, including Tiger Woods suggesting that Dove Mountain \"blow up\" the putting surfaces. This eventually led to a massive renovation project after the tournament, completed in time for the 2010 event. However, scorn from players continued, with the course consistently ranking near the bottom on the PGA Tour's annual player poll ranking tour venues. Each year, one or two top players routinely skipped the event. This issue came to a head in 2014, when Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott (three of the top four in the world rankings) all chose not to enter, with Scott in particular saying he would be more likely to play if the event were staged at a different course. This was the final edition in Arizona; it moved to San Francisco for 2015, then to Austin, Texas, in 2016."

The word \"machrie\" is a corruption of the Scottish Gaelic \"machair\", which means more or less the same as \"links\" did on the east coast of Scotland.\nThe Machrie is an iconic Scottish Championship links style golf course. stretching to 7024 yards from the back tees. An original Willie Campbell design dating back to 1891 it was intentionally made long, at least by 19th Century standards, to attract golfers to Islay. The course was unusual in that its layout crosses the dunes instead of running alongside them like most links courses do, which resulted in multiple blind shots.\nThe Machrie Links hosted a famous match in 1901 between James Braid, John Henry Taylor and Harry Vardon for a prize of £100, reputed to be the largest prize of its kind at that time in the British Isles. Harry Vardon called Mount Zion, originally the first hole, \"the hardest hole I have seen\". The links later hosted the Western Isles Open Championship in June 1935.\nMajor updates.\nThe Links was acquired by Gavyn Davies and his wife Susan Nye, Baroness Nye in 2011; it had been placed in administration in late 2010. The course was redesigned recently, by architect David J. Russell, and reopened in May 2017. The overall rating by Golf World Top 100 in 2019 was 80.6%. The publication's review that discussed the significant design changes included this comment: \"Russell’s routing has a much greater number of expansive views of the sea on the front nine. The internal out of bounds has also gone. Lots of the blind shots have [gone] too.\" After the redesign, the web site Top 100 Golf Courses rated this one as #21 in Scotland in 2019.\nIn addition to the 18-hole Links, the facility offers a Wee course (six par-3 holes) a covered driving range, a short game area and the Hebrides putting course. The new version of the Machrie Hotel, now has 47 bedrooms, including 4 2-bedroom lodges; it opened in 2018, replacing a predecessor, that was described as \"dilapidated\". The previous Machrie hotel had 16 bedrooms and 15 separate lodges.\nThe Islay Golf Club is a privately owned club founded in 1891, which has its home at the Machrie Golf Links for its members."

The Liberator B Mk V in which he was flying suffered fatal engine trouble caused by bullets from a Japanese night fighter at 3:10 am south-west of Rangoon, British Burma. Of the nine men on the plane, three of the occupants, including Adams, are believed to have trapped in the back of the plane, causing them to be killed in the crash. The remaining six men were captured, the 2 officers were separated from the Flight Sergeants and sent to Rangoon Jail, where they survived. The Flight Sergeants, including Stan Woodbridge, later awarded the George Cross, were beheaded by the Japanese Military on 7 February 1945, and are buried in the Taukkyan War Cemetery. After the war the Japanese military officers responsible for the execution were tried for war crimes, and were subsequently executed. Despite numerous searches of the area around the crash site, and discussions with villagers who found the plane, no trace of the body of Adams, or his colleagues, was found.\nHonoured at Castleford Tigers.\nAdams is a Tigers Hall of Fame Inductee."

        "title": "Rugby union in Zimbabwe",
        "text": "Rugby union in Zimbabwe is a popular sport and ranks after association football and cricket as one of the oldest and most popular sports in the country. The Zimbabwe national team, commonly known as the Sables, have been playing international rugby since the early 1900s and have made appearances in two Rugby World Cups Zimbabwe at the Rugby World Cup on two occasions. As with rugby union in Namibia, the country's lack of a professional structure, and opportunity for player's to earn an income playing rugby, has been a problem for national organisers.\nGoverning body.\nThe Rhodesian Rugby Football Union was founded in 1895 and is based in Alexandra Park, Harare.\nHistory.\nThe history of cricket and rugby were closely tied to the early development of the country and were the most central components of white settler sport culture. Cricket and rugby drew the small and scattered white population of Southern Rhodesia together and provided a link with the United Kingdom. More importantly, the two sports 'promoted imperial ideologies of the power of the British and of masculinity expressed through sporting prowess'.\nThrough the political efforts of William Henry Milton and other early administrators, rugby governance became highly structured and was introduced to schools across the country.\nFrom 1952, Rhodesian/Zimbabwean rugby was split into two subregions, centred on the two main cities, Harare (formerly \"Salisbury\" in the north) and Bulawayo in the south.\nFor a number of years, Rhodesia competed as a province in the B division of South Africa's Currie Cup. \nBecause of the boycott of the racist apartheid regime in South Africa, Zimbabwe was the only African side to be invited to the 1987 Rugby World Cup. It managed to requalify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup, but has not been in the tournament subsequently.\nAs a result, unlike football, Zimbabwean rugby came to be seen as a white-dominated sport, with middle class appeal at best. This has created several weaknesses to the strength of the game, as the side relied upon South African competition for its development and was not able to achieve racial and class integration that it should have until after 1980. Another consistent issue is the sports concentration in expensive public and private schools, such as Prince Edward School and Peterhouse Boys School, making the sport largely inaccessible to the bulk of working-class parents and their children. Today the biggest challenge facing the sport today are finances and persistent emigration, as the lack of a professional setup has resulted in the most talented players seeking opportunity elsewhere, with many going on to play for the respective countries they ply their trade in.\nDespite Namibia and Zimbabwe having qualified for the RWC at different times, both of these countries were firmly within the South African orbit, and Zimbabwe had provided South Africa with a number of players such as Tendai Mtawarira, Gary Teichmann, Tonderai Chavanga and Ray Mordt. Regardless of these challenges, the country still produces dozens of quality rugby players who mostly ply their trade in England, Scotland, South Africa and Australia amongst others.\nZimbabwe competes in the Gold Cup and plays regularly against Namibia, Kenya and Madagascar, which serves as its main World Cup qualifying tournament as well as on the international rugby sevens circuit.\nPopularity.\nThere are over 50,123 registered rugby union players in Zimbabwe, with more than 180 high schools and clubs across the country. Participation rates for rugby grew significantly between the national team's participation in their first ever world cup at the 1987 Rugby World Cup and the 1995 Rugby World Cup in nearby South Africa. Participation cooled off during the 2000s, however a spate of recent victories under former coach Liam Middleton has seen the team rise again. Rugby union gets moderate media coverage, often peaking in World Cup years, compared to more popular team sports such as association football and cricket.\nThere are pockets where rugby is particularly popular, such as the city of Harare and the Mashonaland East region, especially Marondera with its high quality boarding schools. In addition, rugby seven tournaments often feature festive atmosphere and attract sell-out crowds.\nThe union and national sides are based in the northern suburb of Alexandra Park. Additionally the domestic Super Six Rugby League (SSRL) plays host to the country's leading rugby clubs – Old Johnnians, Old Georgians, Old Hararians and Old Miltonians among others. The Zimbabwe Rugby Academy, the national development side which plays in the second division of the Currie Cup restoring old ties to South African rugby, with a number of players featuring in South African Currie Cup and Super Rugby sides.\nInternational rugby test matches tend to be hosted at Harare Sports Club, the Police Grounds and at Hartsfield in Bulawayo with a particularly strong rivalry with the Namibia national rugby union team. Tours by top teams are rare and almost always a sellout, highlighting the growing appeal of the game. Traditionally, the city hosted tours by the British &amp; Irish Lions, Argentina and the All-Blacks on their respective tours of South Africa, however, this is no longer the case due to the end of traditional rugby tours and the Zimbabwe national rugby union team's decline in the international rugby rankings. Indeed, Wales were the last major country to tour Harare back in 1993.\nHigh school teams such as Prince Edward School, St. George's College, St. John's College are generally of a high standard and many send their first XV sides to compete against well-known South Africa high schools during Craven Week or on tours to the United Kingdom. Unfortunately after high school, the best players tend to move on to South Africa or the UK, due to a lack of professionalism and greater educational and earning opportunities abroad, thus depleting the strength of rugby union in Zimbabwe. However, there is hope that the large Zimbabwean diaspora, particularly those in South Africa, Britain and New Zealand, can help revitalize the fortunes of the national squad, as is increasingly the case in football.\nNotable players.\nBecause of the complex racial problems of Zimbabwe/Rhodesia and South Africa, most of the best-known players in the past were white. However, there has been a growing number of notable black Zimbabwean players such as Richard Tsimba and his younger brother Kennedy Tsimba, Bedford Chibima, Honeywell Nguruve, Tendai Mtawarira, Brian Mujati, Takudzwa Ngwenya and Tonderai Chavhanga. The Tsimba brothers were inducted together to the IRB Hall of Fame in 2012.\nOther notable Zimbabwean/Rhodesian players include:\nBritish Lions tours.\nThe British Lions toured South Africa a number of times. Despite officially being South African tours, the Lions also played Rhodesia (as it was then). Later tours of the region were stopped until the 1990s, due to the controversy over playing Ian Smith's regime, and apartheid era South Africa."

        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team toured Sri Lanka from June to August 2009. The team played three Test matches, five One Day Internationals, and one Twenty20 International against Sri Lanka. The tour was the return tour of the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan in 2008–09, where during the second test the match was abandoned due to a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team which injured seven players, three staff and killed six Pakistani policemen and two civilians.\nPakistan played a first-class game against Sri Lanka Cricket XI which was drawn. They will play a List A game. The tour continued from 29 June 2009 to 12 August 2009.\nBuild up.\nThe series came just two weeks after Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in ICC world T20 cup final. The Pakistani coach Intikhab Alam was satisfied by the security being provided by the Sri Lankan government, but was concerned about his team shift from T20 cricket to Test cricket. He said,\n\"The key to winning the series against a strong Sri Lankan team will be our ability to adjust to demanding Test match cricket in hot and humid weather. We can’t afford to look back. Winning the Twenty20 title will mean little when the first ball is bowled in the Test series. It’s a different ball game.\"\nPakistan has never lost a series in Sri Lanka, winning past three, and drawing two. The Pakistani side has been boosted by return of Mohammad Yousuf and Abdul Razzaq.\nFrom the 19 Test matches played between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in last five years, Pakistan have won 13, lost 2 and Drawn 4.\nKumar Sangakkara, for whom this is the first Test series as a captain, brushing aside the effects of Lahore attacks and loss to Pakistan in ICC T20 worldcup, said that;\n\"Lahore is not on our minds, the team has done a really great job mentally getting over it, it was heartbreaking to lose the Twenty20 final but we had a great tournament. I am proud of the way the team played in England and I am confident we will do as well in the Test matches.\"\nTest series.\nThe test series consisted of three Test matches at Galle International Stadium in Galle, Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground also in Colombo.\n1st Test.\nMuttiah Muralitharan was ruled out for First Test after injuring his knee during fielding practice. He was replaced in the side for the first test by Rangana Herath.\nODI series.\nThere was five ODIs and one T20 International, played between 30 July and 9 August. They were played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla and R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.\nSecurity.\nTight security has been arranged for visiting team, with Sri Lankan government deploying more than 100 Special Task Force personnel for VIP protection. Stringent measures have been put in place, particularly focusing on security along the routes from hotels to match venues.\nFireworks, musical bands, glass bottles, tin cans, sharp objects, laser pointers and mirrors are banned in the Stadiums. Except national flags of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, no banners, posters and discriminating slogans will be allowed in the ground.\nThe series has started just a month after the Sri Lankan Civil war came to an end.\nMatch fixing.\nPakistan team management complained with hotel management in Colombo over the presence of suspected Indian makers. Express, a mainstream Urdu daily, claimed in a report that some unidentified Indian bookies approached several Pakistani players during the second and third Tests against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Yawar Saeed, the Pakistan team manager said that the incidents did happen but the team management took appropriate steps to erase any chances of further contacts between the players and the bookies."

        "title": "2008–09 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2008–09 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut in the 2008–09 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Coached by Geno Auriemma, the Huskies played their home games at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and on campus at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut, and are a member of the Big East Conference. They enjoyed an undefeated season and won their sixth NCAA championship by defeating the Louisville Cardinals, 76–54.\nRegular season.\nPre-season.\nBoth major pre-season polls ranked the Huskies number 1, each just one vote shy of unanimous. The AP Top 25 poll included all but one vote for Connecticut, with a single vote for Stanford, and the ESPN/USA Today Poll had all but one vote for Connecticut, with a single vote for Tennessee. The team returned much of the previous year's team. Of the departing seniors, only Brittany Hunter started more than half the team's game, although Mel Thomas failed to reach that mark due to a career-ending injury.\nThe Huskies started with a pair of triple digit scoring pre-season games. The first game was against Division II Stonehill College in nearby North Easton, Massachusetts. It was the first chance for fans to see freshman Caroline Doty, Tiffany Hayes, and Heather Buck in action. Caroline and Tiffany both scored in double digits, and Heather had three rebounds and a blocked shot. The final score was in favor of UConn, 100–49. The second pre-season game was even more lopsided, with UConn prevailing over Team SRP 103–37.\nNon conference opener.\nThe regular season opening game was against Georgia Tech, a team unranked in the pre-season. The game would be tied at halftime, with Connecticut pulling ahead late to win by eleven points 82–71. Connecticut would win their next three games easily, beating San Diego State and Rhode Island at home, and BYU in Utah, each win by at least 45 points.\nThe following game would bring #4 ranked Oklahoma to Connecticut. Characterized as a \"significant test\" by ESPN's Graham Hays, Connecticut would win easily by 32 points, 106–72. UConn would then play nearby Holy Cross, winning easily 96–37. In this game Caroline Doty would hit her tenth consecutive three-point goal, a UConn school record, and four off the national record.\nOn December 14, the Huskies competed in the Maggie Dixon Classic at Madison Square Garden and defeated Penn State by a score of 77–63. From December 18 to the 21, the Huskies competed in the Caribbean Classic held in Cancún, Mexico. The Huskies were undefeated at the tournament. After returning from Mexico, the Huskies traveled to South Carolina for their fifth consecutive road game. The team shot 57% from the field, and held their opponents to under 40%. Tina Charles has 21 points and 14 rebounds, helping lead the Huskies to their eleventh victory of the season.\nConnecticut hosted Hartford on New year's Eve. The Hartford Hawks, coached by former UConn star Jen Rizzotti, were no match, falling behind by 33 at halftime. Renee Montgomery hit 9 of 11 in the first half, and did not return in the second half after taking an elbow to the mouth. LSU came to Connecticut for the first game of the new year. Both teams had been to the prior Final Four, each losing in the semi-final round. However, LSU had graduated five seniors, so the Lady Tigers were not expected to be as strong as the previous year's team. The pollsters concurred, not giving LSU a single vote for a top 25 position in either of the two major polls. LSU played stronger than their ranking, losing by 13 for the third closest match of the season to that date. Renee Montgomery's six assists, brought her to 1500 points and 500 assists for her career, a mark reach by only two other UConn players, Diana Taurasi and Jen Rizzotti.\nBeginning of conference play.\nThe Big East opening game would be against South Florida USF would go on to win the WNIT this season, but UConn was far too strong on this day. USF was one of the nation's best scoring team, scoring over 100 on five occasions, including 126 against Grambling State. UConn decided to work on defense, and held USF to just over 25% from the field. USF scored only 11 points in the second half.\nThe next game would be against West Virginia, in West Virginia, the home of UConn senior Renee Montgomery. In her first game in West Virginia, two years prior, she scored seven points. This time she would lead the team in points (28), assists(5), and steals(2) to lead UConn to a 30-point victory in front of her home town crowd. Three days later, UConn would play at home against DePaul. UConn built a 15-point lead by halftime against the unranked team, but despite falling another ten points behind, DePaul would play them even in the second half. The final score was 77–62, in favor of UConn.\nMaya Moore entered the game on 17 January 2009 against Syracuse 29 points shy of 1,000 for her career. She would score 40 to easily surpass that mark, reaching the plateau faster than any other female in UConn history. However, the game would also be notable for a season-ending injury to starter Caroline Doty, reported at the time to be a knee injury. Doty would score 17 points before halftime, but just before halftime, she injured her knee during a fast break. It was the same knee she injured in 2007. Moore's forty points is only the second forty-point performance in UConn women's history; the other is Nykesha Sales' 46 against Stamford in 1997. UConn would win the game 107–53.\nThe following game was a highly anticipated showdown between the #1- and #2-ranked teams in the nation. Both Connecticut and North Carolina entered the game 17–0 on the season. Connecticut had the higher ranking, but would need to replace starter Carolyn Doty. Her knee injury in the prior game would turn out to be a season-ending ACL tear. The result would be anticlimactic, as UConn reached a double-digit lead early in the game, extended to a 46–30 halftime lead, and finished with a 30-point victory, 88–58. The five starters, including Lorin Dixon in her first start of the season, would each score in double digits, led by Renee Montgomery with 21.\nThe next game against Cincinnati would be even more lopsided. UConn outscored the Bearcats in the first half 39–7. The seven points allowed in the first half were only one point off the school record of six in a half. While Cincinnati would outscore the Huskies in the second half 27–26, the outcome was not in doubt.\nThe 26 January game against Louisville would pit UConn against the team they beat by only six in the previous year's Big East tournament title game. Louisville was ranked 10th in the nation, and still had Angel McCoughtry, winner of the Big East Conference Women's Basketball Player of the Year in 2007. Angle would live up to her reputation with 24 points and 14 rebounds, but it wasn't enough, as Maye Moore scored 27 to lead UConn to a 93–65 win.\nThe next game was against unranked Georgetown. UConn would win by 19, with five players scoring in double digits, but the game was surprisingly close, given that the average margin of victory for UConn was 34 at that point. The following game was against Rutgers, a team that has often given UConn a strong challenge, winning half of the last ten meetings. Rutgers would stay close in the first half, entering the half down only six 34–28, but UConn would pull away in the second half behind a double-double by Moore (24 points, 10 rebounds).\nMarquette would endure another double-double by Moore (22 points, 10 rebounds), in their 83–49 loss to UConn on 7 February. The following game against unranked St. John's on 11 February, started as if it would be another rout. UConn led by 15 at halftime, and increased the lead to 20. The St. John's team responded and cut the lead to seven, before UConn regrouped and finished with a 13-point victory, 77–64. Maya would contribute another double-double (20 points, 10 rebounds), while Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles each scored 21 points.\nThe next game would be the last game of the season at Gampel Arena. The game itself would be anticlimactic, as UConn easily beat Pittsburgh 95–42. The highlight of the evening would be the induction into the Huskies of Honor for Renee Montgomery, kept a secret from her until the announcement. One of her first reactions, after the shock of the announcement, was the regret that her parents wouldn't see it, but seconds later, her parents would walk onto the floor. They had been in town, but shared the secret. Renee is the first active player at UConn to be so honored. She would go on to score a team high 20 points.\nOn the 18th of February, Connecticut played Providence in Providence. The Huskies scored the first eleven points, and never trailed. The Huskies started the second half in even more impressive fashion, scoring the first 25 points of the half. UConn would win easily 75–39.\nThe following game was against Notre Dame, ranked 24th at the time. The Notre Dame Irish would give Connecticut their toughest match of the year. The Irish lead most of the first half. Although UConn would go to the half with a three-point lead, Notre Dame outscored UConn in the initial minutes of the second half, with a lead of 43–41 at one time. Prior to this game the Huskies had trailed for only a combined 27 minutes all season. Connecticut would retake the lead, and finished the game with a ten-point margin, the closest game of the season to that date.\nOn the 24th of February, UConn hosted Villanova. Tina Charles had a double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead UConn to the win 74–47. Four days later, Seton Hall came to Hartford, for the last regular season game of the year. As a surprise for the departing seniors, Maya Moore and Kaili McLaren sang the national anthem. Moore then went on to score 18 points, to help lead UConn to an 81–50 win, and guarantee a share of the Big East regular-season title.\nOn 2 March 2009, UConn played its last regular season game against rival Rutgers. UConn moved out to a 16-point halftime lead 36–20, but Rutgers outscored UConn in the second half to make the final score ten points, tied for closest result of the season. The win leaves the Huskies still undefeated on the season, now 30–0.\nBig East tournament.\nConnecticut opened the Big East tournament against South Florida, a team it had beaten by 46 points earlier in the season. This game would be closer, but not by much. Kalana Greene led the Huskies with a season-high 20 points, scoring 18 points before halftime, and leading the Huskies to a 47–10 halftime lead. USF would match the UConn production in the second half, but the 37 point margin held. The final score was 79–42.\nThe second tournament game was against Villanova, a team UConn had beaten by 27 points less than two weeks earlier. However, the game was tied at 25 apiece, with under six minutes to go in the first half. Maya Moore then helped lead the team on a 23–2 run to put the game out of reach. The Huskies won 72–42.\nThe final game, on 10 March, for the Big East tournament championship, was against Louisville, ranked #7 in the country. The Cardinals who would go on to play in the Finals of the NCAA tournament, were no match for UConn on this day. Maya Moore left the game with eight minutes to go, having scored 28 points. At that time the Louisville team had scored 27. UConn would win the game in convincing fashion, 75–36.\nSchedule.\nSource\n!colspan=8| Regular season\n!colspan=9| 2009 Big East Women's Basketball Tournament\n!colspan=10| 2009 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament"

        "text": "The 2009–10 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut in the 2009–2010 NCAA Division I basketball season. The Huskies were coached by Geno Auriemma, as the Huskies played their home games at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in the XL Center located in Hartford, Connecticut, and on campus at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies are a member of the Big East Conference and won their seventh NCAA championship against Stanford on April 6, 2010.\nRegular season.\nPre-season.\nThe Connecticut team opened the year ranked No. 1 in the ESPN Coaches poll and the AP Top 25 Poll, following a 39–0 record leading to a national championship in the prior season. In both cases, the polling results were unanimous. UConn graduated three seniors, Renee Montgomery, Tahirah Williams and Cassie Kerns, but only Renee was a regular starter. The team added one freshman, Kelly Faris, and Caroline Doty returned to the line-up after missing most of the prior season due to injury.\nThe two preseason games were wins against St. Rose College(85–44) and Vanguard (98–68).\nNon-conference games.\nThe defending national champions opened their season against Northeastern. The outcome of the game was never in doubt, with a final score of 105–35; the game was more about personal accomplishments than the game itself. Senior Tina Charles pulled down her 1000th career rebound while senior Kalana Greene scored her 1000th career point. The win would continue a consecutive streak started the previous year, then at 40 games.\nThe game against Texas, played in San Antonio, the location of this season's Final Four, was expected to be competitive, as Texas was ranked tenth in the nation by the AP. However, UConn pulled out to a 21-point lead by halftime, and ended up winning by 25, 83–58.\nConnecticut's next game against Holy Cross would mark the 20th game between the two teams, an annual competition going back to the 1985–86 season. At the start of the series, the schools were competitive, with the teams splitting the first four meetings. However, UConn has not lost since, and entered the game with a 17–2 series record. UConn prevailed 87–34.\nAfter the WBCA Classic, UConn would play Vermont in a rematch of the previous year's NCAA opening round game. UConn won easily 84–42, on a night in which senior Tina Charles became the second leading rebounder in school history.\nUConn's next opponent, Hartford, was coached by former UConn star Jennifer Rizzotti. Hartford had never beaten UConn, and this game would be no exception, with UConn winning 80–45 for the eleventh consecutive victory over the Hawks. In the next game, UConn easily beat Iona 90–35.\nThe Stanford game was one of the most anticipated games of the season. Both teams came into the game undefeated. UConn was ranked No. 1 in the AP writer's poll and the ESPN Coaches poll, while Stanford was ranked No. 2 in each poll. Stanford's last loss was to UConn in the 2009 NCAA Final Four game, while UConn's last loss was to Stanford in the 2008 Final Four game.\nUConn hadn't been behind in a game at halftime or later all season until this game, but Stanford entered halftime with a slim two-point lead. However, after trading baskets early in the second half, UConn pulled out to a 22-point lead (74–52) with five minutes left in the game, and coasted to their 49th consecutive victory, all of which were won with a double-digit margin.\nUConn ended the calendar year with a 78–59 victory over 11th-ranked Florida State. The game was relatively close at halftime, 41–35, but UConn's Tina Charles scored 16 of her 24 points in the second half to help ensure a victory.\nUConn took a break from conference games to play a home game against the University of North Carolina(UNC). At the time, UNC was ranked seventh in the country. Despite the prospect of a close game, it was never close. Tina Charles scored 25 points in the first half, single-handedly outscoring the entire UNC team. UConn lead at halftime 56–24, and go on to win by 41 points, 88–47. ESPN's Graham Hays called \"the first-half play as good as it gets\".\nConnecticut had played ACC teams Florida State and North Carolina; on 18 January, they would play their third ACC team of the season, Duke. Just as North Carolina had been ranked seventh at the time of the game, the Duke team was the seventh ranked team in the country. The margin of victory would not be as large as the UNC game, but it was still a convincing win, with UConn outscoring Duke 81–48. In contrast to the UNC game in which the first half was decision, Duke would remain reasonably close at halftime, down only ten, 38–28, but UConn would stretch out the lead in the second half. Maya Moore hit six three point field goals in the game, and Kalana Greene scored 18 points.\nConnecticut faced Oklahoma in a late, out-of-conference match-up on February 15. Oklahoma was ranked 12th in the nation, but UConn had faced higher ranked opponents, and won relatively easily. Midway through the first half, it appeared UConn was heading for another easy win, as they had doubled the Sooners score 24–12. However, Oklahoma brought the game back to a two-point margin at halftime, and took a one-point lead in the second half. Five minutes later, UConn had opened up a ten-point lead, and extended the lead to a final 16 point margin 76–60.\nWBCA Classic.\nThe WBCA Classic Tournament was held at the UConn campus 27–29 November 2009. Coach Geno Auriemma is the current president of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association. The four teams participating in the three-day round robin event were host UConn, Hofstra, Richmond, and Clemson. Richmond beat Clemson 86–67 in the first game. UConn easily beat Hofstra 91–46, but the game was notable for being Auriemma's 700th career win. Auriemma reached 700 victories the fastest of any coach in Division I history, reaching the mark in his 822nd game.\nThe following day, Clemson defeated Hofstra 69–68, while UConn defeated Richmond 86–37. On the final day of the tournament, Richmond defeated Hofstra 42–41, while UConn won the tournament with their victory over Clemson 87–48.\nConference games.\nUConn opened conference play against Seton Hall on 2 Jan 2010. Most away games against Seton Hall are played on campus, but this game was played at the Prudential Center in Newark. The result was never in doubt, as UConn won 91–24, their largest margin over a Big East team in seven years. UConn's second conference game was at home against the University of South Florida. UConn started out with an 18–2 run, but Charles and Moore got into early foul trouble, and had to sit on the bench. Nevertheless, UConn had a double-digit lead at halftime, leading coach Auriemma to quip, \"This is the only place in America where you've got to apologize for being up 14 at halftime.\"\nUConn's next game, against Cincinnati, was notable more for the coaching match up than the game. After twelve years as an assistant coach at Connecticut and four years as a player, Jamelle Elliott took the head coaching job at Cincinnati. This would be the first match up between Cincinnati and Connecticut since Elliot left Connecticut. UConn won easily 83–51.\nUConn returned to Big east play after the UNC game with a game against Marquette at their arena. The game outcome wasn't in doubt, as Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 11 rebounds) leading to a 24-point halftime lead, and a final score of 68–43. The game was unusual for a rare coaching decision near the end of the game. UConn typically declines to attempt to score if the game result is not in doubt, and they are inbounding the ball with less than 30 seconds to play, preferring just to dribble out the end of the game. However, in this game, with 72 seconds on the clock, Coach Auriemma instructed his player not to even cross half-court, deliberately accepting a shot clock violation and a turnover. The announcers were unsure of the reason at the time, but subsequent remarks by Auriemma clarified that he felt the officials were not doing enough to stop rough play, and he didn't want to \"put his players into any more physical danger by crossing midcourt\".\nUConn's game against Notre Dame on 16 January didn't tipoff until 9 pm, but the arena opened at 7:30 in the morning. The ESPN CollegeGame Day event, traditionally held at the campus on a men's basketball game, held its first ever College Game Day in connection with a women's basketball game. The campus, shut down for winter break, opened a day earlier than usual to allow students to return in time to attend GameDay. Thousands turned to be in the backdrop of the 10 am national coverage. Because the event occurred in the morning, the UConn team was able to participate.\nThe game in the evening would pit two undefeated teams—UConn, ranked No. 1 in the country with a 16–0 record and Notre Dame, ranked No. 3 in the country, with a 15–0 record. Despite the closeness of the rankings, and records, the game would not be close. UConn pulled out to a 42–19 halftime lead, and coasted to a 24-point victory, winning 70–46. Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 13 rebounds), leading ESPN's Mechelle Voepel to call Charles \"another one of UConn's all-time greats\".\nUConn continued their undefeated season with a win over Villanova, 74–35. This marked the first ever start for senior Meghan Gardler. While seniors traditionally get a starting role on senior day, the Villanova game was played near Gardler's hometown of Springfield Pennsylvania. Many friends and family members were at the game to see her play. The team, which normally would travel by plane to Pennsylvania, took the train, just for the experience.\nRutgers is known for its defense, but UConn's defense would prove to be superior, as UConn held Rutgers to 36 points, while scoring 73. Rutgers was the last team to beat UConn in the regular season, winning at their home in 2008, but on this day, the results would not be close. UConn next played Pittsburgh, but the story of the game was not the game result, which UConn won easily. 98–56, but the benchmark reached by Tina Charles, as she became only the sixth player in UConn history to score 2,000 points in her career.\nThe next conference opponent, West Virginia would be ranked No. 8 in the country at the time of the game, but had already faced strong teams this season, and had beaten West Virginia by 30 points in the previous year. This year's final score of 80–47 would produce a wider margin, but with a halftime margin of only 12, and a lead dropping to single-digits a few minutes into the second half, the game outcome appeared more in doubt than the final score would indicate.\nThe last time Connecticut played Louisville, it was for the national championship in April 2009. That game wasn't close, but this one would be less of a challenge. UConn tripled Louisville's first half scoring, leading to a 54–18 first half score, and cruised to a final score of 84–38.\nDePaul was within nine points almost 15 minutes into the game, but Tiffany Hayes and Tina Charles started scoring, each ending up with 19 points for the game. The halftime lead was 20, and UConn started the second half with an 11–1 run to put the game away. The final score was 95–62.\nBefore the game against St. John's, Tina Charles was inducted into Huskies of Honor, to reflect her position as one of the most significant figures in the history of the team. Despite the emotion, she scored 25 points and a career high 21 rebounds to help lead UConn over the 24th ranked Red Storm in one of the closest games of the year, with a final score of 66–52. Only the 12 point win over Stanford was closer than the 14 point win against St. John's.\nConnecticut did not have any trouble against Providence on 20 February, quickly building a 20-point lead and extending the lead in the second half, behind a career high points total of 26 from Tina Charles and 21 from Maya Moore. UConn has now won 237 consecutive victories against unranked opponents at home. Connecticut would continue their winning streak against Syracuse four days later, when Maya Moore had a season high 38 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in an 87–66 victory.\nConnecticut played 11th ranked Georgetown with an opportunity to clinch the Big East regular season title. Tina Charles, who had tied her season high points total a week earlier, set a new season record with 33 points, hitting 14 of 16 shot. Seniors Kaili McLaren, Meghan Gardler and Jacquie Fernandes started the game along with Charles and Greene, to follow the tradition of starting seniors in their final home game. Although Georgetown started out strong, hitting three 3-pointers to take an early 9–4 lead, and extended it to 15–9, the largest deficit UConn has faced this season, the team retook the lead later in the first half and did not trail again, winning with a final score of 84–62.\nThe last regular season game was a rematch against Notre Dame. The usual Big East schedule has two games against one opponent—for several seasons, that opponent was Rutgers, but this season, it was the eighth ranked Notre Dame team. UConn won easily 76–51. Tina Charles set two UConn career records in the same game, becoming the all-time scoring leader, surpassing Nykesha Sales's record of 2,178 and became the all-time rebound leader, surpassing Rebecca Lobo's record of 1,268.\nRegular season schedule.\nXLC—Veterans Memorial Coliseum at XL Center\nε\nExhibition\nβ\nBig East\nBig East tournament.\nQuarter-final.\nThe Big East tournament started with first round action on Friday, 5 March 2010. By virtue of being one of the top four seeds, UConn earned a double-bye, with their first game scheduled in the quarterfinals on Sunday. Syracuse beat Seton Hall on Friday, then beat Providence on Saturday to earn the match up against the number one seeded team in the tournament.\nThe game would never be close, with UConn leading at the half 44–17, and ended with a 77–41 victory. UConn's Tina Charles would tie her career high with 34 points, while Maya Moore would score the 2000th point of her career, ending the game with 16 points, 14 rebounds and 7 assists. The win would be UConn's 70th consecutive win, tying an NCAA Division I record for the longest winning streak in the history of women's college basketball, set by UConn in 2003.\nSemi-final.\nUConn would break their own 70-game winning streak with a 59–44 victory over Notre Dame on March 8, 2010, earning their 71st straight victory; every single victory during their current streak has been by at least 10 points. The Huskies will play in the Big East Championship game on March 9, 2010, which will be their last game before the NCAA Tournament.\nBig East Championship Game.\nUConn defeated West Virginia, 60–32, to improve their winning streak to 72 games, and making their season record 33–0. Kalana Greene's 15 points guided the Huskies to victory, and help her to earn the Most Outstanding Player award for the tournament. UConn closed the game on 27–4 run after leading 33–28 early in the second half.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Basketball tournament.\nUConn was awarded a No. 1 seed (the number one overall seed) and assigned to the Dayton bracket. Their first-round game was against Southern, the winner of the SWAC tournament. Southern would score the first two points, but that would be their only lead of the game. Tina Charles hit her first nine shot attempts, on her way to a 22-point game, and teammate Maya More would add 21. Others would score as well, but those two scored enough to outscore the Jaguars. UConn's defense would hold the Jaguars to just ten second half points.\nThe second-round game was against Temple. The Temple team is coached by Tonya Cardoza, who was an assistant coach at UConn for 14 years, before she accepted the head coaching job at Temple prior to the start of the 2008–2009 season. The game also occurred on Auriemma's 56th birthday. UConn outscored Temple 55–12 in the first half, hitting 78% of their field goal attempts. The starting players ended up playing no more than half the game. Auriemma described the game as \"pretty incredible performance\".\nThe Sweet Sixteen game was against Iowa State. The two teams last played each other in 1999, when Iowa State knocked number one seeded UConn out of the NCAA tournament. This time, the result would be quite different. Maya Moore outscored Iowa State in the first half, despite sitting more than ten minutes with two fouls. The lead would grow to 50, at which time the starters all sat for the remainder of the game, and the final margin tightened. The final score was 74–36.\nIn the Dayton Regional final, there was a rematch of a game earlier this season against Florida State, and it was no contest as the Huskies rolled thanks to Maya Moore's 22 points and Tina Charles added 20 points and had 14 rebounds in a 90–50 rout of the Lady Seminoles. The win earned them a trip to the Women's Final Four and a date with Baylor and one of the most dominant players in women's basketball, Brittney Griner.\nThe Final Four semi-final game against Baylor started the way many games this season have started. Despite playing a top-ranked team, Connecticut went out to leads of 11–3 and 25–8. Baylor didn't quit, and by halftime, the 17-point lead was down to 13. UConn scored the first basket of the second half, but then Baylor scored twelve consecutive points, to cut the margin to three. Baylor's 6' 8\" center Griner had five blocks to go along with 13 points and six rebounds. In contrast, UConn's center Charles had two blocks along with 21 points and 13 rebounds, while Maya Moore scored 34 points, the fourth highest point total in semifinal history. The final score in favor of Connecticut was 70–50, setting up a rematch with Stanford.\nThe National Championship game on Tuesday was against Stanford. Stanford's last loss was to Connecticut in December 2009, and Connecticut's last loss was to Stanford, exactly two years before, in the Final Four of 2008. The game started the way many games for Connecticut have started—just over two minutes into the game, Connecticut had a 5–0 lead. However, they would not score for over ten minutes, missing sixteen consecutive shots. Stanford would lead by as many as nine points, and would go to halftime with a 20–12 lead. The twelve points scored by UConn was the lowest first half total in the history of Connecticut basketball.\nMaya Moore lead the team after the half, scoring 11 of the team's first 17 points, including the basket that put Connecticut back into the lead, this time for good. Moore would end up with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and earned Most Outstanding Player honors for the Final Four. Connecticut would go on to win 53–47, ending their streak of double-digit victories, but winning their 78th consecutive game, resulting in their seventh national championship, their second consecutive undefeated season and their fourth overall undefeated season."

Senior Dave Downey led the team in scoring, as he had the previous two seasons, and he moved into first on the all-time scoring list. Downey also set the school record for points in a game, which still stands, with 53 in a road loss to Indiana on February 16, 1963. Illinois was a game back of first place in the league standings with only two games remaining when the Assembly Hall opened its doors on March 4, 1963. Illinois’ first game at \"the Hall\" was an exciting 79-73 victory over Northwestern before 16,137 fans to stay within a game of first-place Ohio State. After Illinois edged Iowa, 73-69, in the last game of the season, the Fighting Illini would need an overtime loss two hours later by the Buckeyes at Indiana to share the title.

Illinois advanced to the NCAA Regional Finals before dropping a heart-breaking 54–51 loss to Kentucky on its home court, causing the NCAA to put a rule in place not allowing a school to play in a tournament game on its home court.

The only time they finished with a better conference record was 1943, where they completed the season with a perfect 12-0 record. Head coach Harry Combes had guided his team to a Big Ten championship, a third-place finish in the 1951 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and a final AP ranking of No. 5 in the nation. This was Combes 2nd Big Ten Championship as well as his 2nd third-place finish in the NCAA tournament within his first 4 years as head coach. The 1950-51 team compiled an overall record of 22 wins and 5 losses with a conference record of 13 wins and 1 loss. The season featured a rematch with Kentucky, which had downed the Illini in the national semifinals in 1949. Illinois beat Columbia, 79-71, and North Carolina State, 84-70, to get to the national semifinals and a rematch with the Wildcats. In a heart-breaking loss, Kentucky nipped Illinois, 76-74, on a shot by Wildcat sub Shelby Linville with 12 seconds remaining in the game.

Head coach Harry Combes had guided his team to a Big Ten championship, a third place finish in the 1952 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and a final AP ranking of No. 2 in the nation. Combes was beginning to build a dynasty in Champaign with 3 Big Ten Championships and 3 third place finishes in the NCAA tournament in his first 5 years at the helm. The 1951-52 season not only brought Illinois another Big Ten title, it also introduced John Kerr, a center from Tilden Tech in Chicago. He began his three-year reign as Illinois’ top scorer with a sophomore-record 357 points. The Illini recorded a 22-4 overall mark and went 12-2 in the conference. Once again, Illinois advanced to the national semifinals and ran into underdog St. John’s. The Redmen fought their way to a 61-59 victory in the NCAA’s first Final Four, in Seattle. Illinois took another third-place award home after beating Santa Clara, 67-64, behind 26 points by Kerr.

The team was so athletic that they could \"run and alley-oop\" baskets using even the non-starting players, and a record number of 100+ game scores reflected this fact. The players known as the\n\"“Flying Illini,”\" included all the important pieces from the 1987-88 squad (Kenny Battle, Kendall Gill, Steve Bardo, Lowell Hamilton, Nick Anderson and Larry Smith) as well as junior college All-American P.J. Bowman and former high school All-American Marcus Liberty. The Fighting Illini won their first 16 games and were ranked No. 2 in the nation going into a nationally televised game against Georgia Tech, whom Illinois had already beaten, 80-75, at the Rainbow Classic in December. The Yellow Jackets led, 47-31, but Illinois managed to surge back to force overtime, eventually needing two extra periods to win the game. Along with the No. 1 ranking the next day came some bad news. Illinois’ catalyst, Gill, had broken a bone in his foot and would miss the next 12 games. Hurt by the loss of Gill, Illinois lost three of the next four games and its No. 1 ranking. The Illini rallied to finish second in the Big Ten with a 14-4 record and with Gill back in the lineup, the Illini were awarded a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament. After rolling to victories over McNeese State and Ball State at the Hoosier Dome, a powerpacked regional in Minneapolis with Missouri, Louisville and Syracuse, stood in the way of Illinois’ trip to the Final Four.\nLouisville fell victim to Illinois, losing 83-69, which set up a regional final matchup with Syracuse. The Fighting Illini held off Syracuse to advance to the Final Four in Seattle where Illinois faced Michigan, a team it\nhad beaten twice already in conference play, in the national semifinals. Michigan was inspired by the firing of their coach prior to the tournament, and won a game that contained 33 lead changes.

        "text": "Vancouver Golf Club, located in the Canadian city of Coquitlam, British Columbia, is the oldest golf club in the Lower Mainland.\nEstablished in 1910, it opened the following year on a former sheep farm on the west side of Blue Mountain. The suburban club was originally considered to be far outside of the major population centre of Vancouver, requiring a trip on the British Columbia Electric Railway and often an overnight stay at the club. Today, the club is considered to be centrally located in the Lower Mainland.\nThe club has hosted the Canadian Women's Open four times on the LPGA Tour, in 1988, 1991, 2012,and 2015. The first two events were held as the du Maurier Classic, a women's major, and were won by Sally Little and Nancy Scranton, respectively. The 2012 edition was won by 15-year-old amateur Lydia Ko, then Lydia repeated in 2015 with a playoff win over Stacey Lewis. Vancouver Golf Club also hosted one Senior PGA Tour event in the 1985, the Canada Senior Open Championship, won by Peter Thomson of Australia.\nThe Club commissioned a 3.5 million cu. ft. Reservoir fed from an aquifer in 1996 to supply natural water to the golf course irrigation system. \nCriticism.\nThe club became the subject of controversy in 2008 when it became known that a rule was implemented eight years earlier that required new members to be able to speak English, regardless of their ability to pay the $65,000 full-play membership fee. The club stated it did not forbid members from speaking other languages while on the grounds, but required the English proficiency in order to ensure that members could understood and abide by club rules."

The tournament opened with the first and second rounds on Thursday through Sunday, March 18–21, 2010. Regional games were played on Thursday through Sunday, March 28–31, 2010, with the Final Four played on Sunday and Tuesday, April 4 and 6, 2010.\nThe Connecticut Huskies successfully defended their national title from the previous season, defeating Stanford 53–47 in the final. This was the Huskies' second consecutive unbeaten championship season, unprecedented since the NCAA began to organize women's basketball in the 1981–82 season.\nPreseason.\nPreseason WNIT.\nOhio State headlines a field of 16-teams for the 2009 Preseason Women's National Invitation Tournament. The field includes 11 teams that played in the postseason last spring: Arkansas-Little Rock, Bowling Green, Florida Gulf Coast, Georgia Tech, Marist, New Mexico, North Carolina A&amp;T, Ohio State, Oklahoma State, West Virginia, and Winthrop. They will be joined in the Preseason WNIT field by Chicago State, Eastern Illinois, Northern Colorado, Towson, and UTEP.\nThe Preseason WNIT features a three-game guarantee format. The event opens Friday, November 13 with first-round games. Second-round games will be played November 15 and 16. The semifinals will be on November 18 and 19. The championship is set for Sunday, November 22. Teams that lose in the first two rounds will play consolation games on the second weekend, November 20–22. All games are hosted by participating schools, and sites are announced by the end of the preceding round. In last year's Preseason WNIT, North Carolina defeated Oklahoma 80-79.\nRegular season.\nConference winners and tournaments.\nThirty athletic conferences each end their regular seasons with a single-elimination tournament. The teams in each conference that win their regular season title are given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers applied if more than one team tops the season standings. In the table below, if teams tied for the regular-season title, the first team listed won the tiebreaker for top seed in the tournament.\nThe winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2010 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament.

Besided the Gems moniker Quincy minor league teams played as the (Quincy Cubs (1965–1973), Quincy Jets (1962–1963), Quincy Giants (1960–1961), Quincy Indians (1928–1933), Quincy Red Birds (1925–1927), Quincy Old Soldiers (1912), Quincy Infants (1911), Quincy Vets (1909–1910), Quincy Giants (1899), Quincy (1898), Quincy Little Giants (1897), Quincy Blue Birds (1896), Quincy Ravens (1890–1892, 1894), Quincy Black Birds (1889) and Quincy Quincys (1883–1884)).\nThe team was known as the Quincy Ravens from 1890 to 1892, and then again in 1894. The team played in the Illinois Iowa League in 1891 and 1892, before moving to the Western Association in 1894. They were managed by Sam LaRocque and William Wittrock in 1892. Several major leaguers played for the Ravens, one of the most prominent being Sam Gillen who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies. During the 1981 season, Pete Daniels threw 321 innings compiling a 0.79 ERA for the Ravens. \nThe franchise played in the Western Association (1894–1899), Iowa State League (1907), Central Association (1908–1910), Three-I League (1911–1932, 1946–1956), and the Midwest League (1960–73).

        "text": "The Navy Midshipmen men's lacrosse team represents the United States Naval Academy in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's lacrosse. Navy currently competes as a member of the Patriot League and play their home games at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. During the 20th century, the Midshipmen secured 17 national championships, including 2 United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association titles and 15 Wingate Memorial Trophy awards. During the 1960s, a period of dominance for the Midshipmen, they won eight consecutive titles. The program's main rivals include Army, Maryland, and Johns Hopkins.\nHistory.\nLacrosse began at the Naval Academy in 1908 when two former Johns Hopkins players, Frank Breyer and Bill Hudgins, volunteered to help form a team. On April 4, they played their first game, against their co-founders' alma mater, which they lost, 1–6. In 1911, George Finlayson took over as head coach and a year later led Navy to its first undefeated season. The start of the First World War caused a cancellation of the 1917 season after just two games, but also marked the start of seven season undefeated streak. From mid-season in 1916 to the final game of 1923, Navy won 45 consecutive games.\nThe founder of the lacrosse program at cross-city rival St. John's, William \"Dinty\" Moore became the Navy head coach in 1936. He remained at the helm for 23 years, during which time he helped Navy compile six national championships.\nIn April 1941 Navy superintendent Rear Admiral Russell Wilson refused to allow the team to play a visiting team from Harvard University because the Harvard team included a black player. Harvard's athletic director ordered the player home and the game was played on April 4, as scheduled, which Navy won 12-0.\nIn 1945, the Midshipmen hosted their arch-rival Army for the traditional final game of the season. The teams fought to a stalemate, and after two overtime periods, finished the season as national co-champions.\nIn 1959, Willis Bilderback, a Rutgers alumnus, took over the program and led Navy to their \"Decade of Dominance\". During the 1960s, in large part due to a stifling defense and talented Hall of Fame attackman Jimmy Lewis, the Midshipmen compiled a 96–14-1 record (.865) and won eight consecutive national championships, including six outright. Health problems forced Bilderback to retire after the 1972 season.\nHe was replaced by Dick Szlasa, who coached Navy to ten consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. Bryan Matthews took over in 1983, and Richie Meade replaced him in turn in 1995. Navy became a member of a conference for the first time in 2000 when it joined the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Lacrosse League. In 2004, they left the ECAC to join the Patriot League. The Midshipmen have finished first outright or tied for first every year of their membership, from 2004 to 2009. Navy has also won the Patriot League tournament five of those six years.\nChampionships.\nStarting in 1926, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) began rating college lacrosse teams and awarding gold medals to the top teams. Navy was the recipient of one of these in 1928, alongside Johns Hopkins, Maryland, and Rutgers — each of which had only one regular-season collegiate defeat. From 1936 through 1970, the USILA awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the annual champion, based on regular-season records. In 1971, the NCAA began hosting an annual men's tournament to determine the national champion. The Wingate Memorial Trophy was presented to the first two NCAA Division I champions (1971 and 1972) and was then retired. Navy has won 17 national championships:\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Navy's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus.\nMacLaughlin Award.\nThe Lt. Donald MacLaughlin Jr. Award has been given annually since 1973 by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) to the nation's most outstanding midfielders in NCAA Division I, Division II, and Division III. The award is named for Lt. (j.g.) Donald MacLaughlin Jr. (Class of 1963), an All-American Navy midfielder who died on a combat mission in South Vietnam in 1966.\nAthletic Hall of Fame.\nFor lacrosse players in the USNA Athletic Hall of Fame, see footnote"

Mayo received improper benefits in violation of NCAA rules while at USC, and Floyd was found to have assisted in the obtainment of these improper benefits. USC has declared Mayo was therefore ineligible to play in 2007–2008, and as a result, USC has vacated all wins from the 2007–2008 regular season, dropping their record to 1–32.

While with Swansea, Morgan gained his first international cap for Wales when he was selected to face England as part of the 1938 Home Nations Championship. The previous tournament had been a terrible campaign for Wales, losing all three matches. The selectors reacted by bringing in four new caps into the pack, while retaining confidence in veteran backs. Morgan was brought in with Walter Vickery, Allan McCarley and Fred Morgan, which saw the pack transform the Welsh play, resulting in the first Welsh win over England in five years. Morgan was reselected for the rest of the tournament, which saw Wales losing narrowly away to Scotland, and a win over Ireland.\nMorgan was later selected for the British Lions for their 1938 tour of South Africa, playing in 14 matches and gaining two caps in the first two tests. On his return he gained one final Welsh cap when he played against England in the opening game of the 1939 Home Nations Championship.

The Ivy League awards the conference championship to the team with the best record at the conclusion of the regular season. If two or more teams are tied with the same record the championship is shared.\nThe team was undefeated and untied in league play during 17 of their 20 outright championships, the most of any Ivy team.\nSince the introduction of the Ivy League lacrosse tournament in 2010 Cornell has won the tournament twice, in 2011 and 2018.\nThe Big Red have appeared in the NCAA lacrosse tournament 30 times.\nCornell has won the three championships and were runner up five times, most recently in 2022 when they lost to Maryland 9-7.\nCornell maintains the oldest ongoing rivalry in college lacrosse with the Hobart College Statesmen.

        "text": "Frog Baseball is an animated short film created by Mike Judge in 1992, which marks the first appearance of the Beavis and Butt-Head characters. It premiered in The Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation.\nPlot.\nThe short starts out with a title card that says \"Inbred Jed's Homemade Cartoons\", with the character of Inbred Jed staring at the camera and cackling. Two teenagers by the name of Beavis and Butt-Head are shown switching channels on their TV, watching TV commercials and laughing at a Suzanne Somers ThighMaster commercial. Later, while blowing up insects with firecrackers in a field, Beavis and Butt-Head spot a frog and exclaim \"frog baseball!\"; they then proceed to play baseball with the frog. After they kill the frog, they see a poodle and charge after the dog with a baseball bat, exclaiming \"dog baseball!\". The credits roll as the viewer hears the duo hit the poodle with a bat and the poodle yelping in pain (not seen).\nDVD.\nIt is available on Disc 3 of Volume 3 of \"\" and on the Mike Judge's Most Wanted DVD as a special feature. It is also slightly edited from the MTV broadcast and the Liquid TV version. It is more on par with the Spike &amp; Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation airing. The end title card that showed a still from the cartoon in which Butt-head's bat made contact with Beavis' head and reads \"No animals were harmed in the making of this film... except for Beavis\" is removed from the DVD version. It instead shows the original disclaimer “No animals were harmed in the making of this film” leaving out the Beavis part, like in the liquid TV version and the MTV TV version.\nCultural references.\nThe duo play Black Sabbath's \"Iron Man\" and Deep Purple's \"Smoke on the Water\" on air guitar.\nThe short, along with the episode \"Held Back\", was also mentioned in the \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" episode \"Snitchers\", the 20th episode of the 8th season. The way the duo scream \"FROG BASEBALL!\" in the short was also used in a music video commentary in \"Give Blood\"."

        "text": "The 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 9, after the conclusion of the 1985–86 NHL season. The playoffs concluded on May 24 with the champion Montreal Canadiens defeating the Calgary Flames 4–1 to win the Stanley Cup, in five games.\nThis was the last time to date that all active Canadian teams have qualified in the same season and also the second time that all seven active teams at the time qualified, the first occurring three years earlier. The 1986 playoffs saw three first place teams eliminated in the opening round and the fourth, Edmonton, bowed out in the second. This was the last time that all six Sutter brothers participated in the playoffs in the same year.\nIn the first round, six of the eight series ended in a three-game sweep. The only two first-round series that did not were the Rangers over the Flyers, and the Blues over the North Stars, both going the full five games.\nThe Montreal Canadiens decided to go with a rookie goaltender by the name of Patrick Roy. This decision proved to be a good one just like when the Canadiens rode rookie goalie Ken Dryden to a Stanley Cup championship in 1971. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Canadiens beat the Calgary Flames, who were also riding a rookie netminder, Mike Vernon. Patrick Roy won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP and had a sparkling 1.92 goals against average along with 15 wins. St. Louis forwards Doug Gilmour and Bernie Federko led the playoffs in scoring with 21 points despite missing the finals; this feat was not repeated until 1999.\nThe 1986 playoffs marked the first time that all four former WHA teams made the playoffs in the same year. This would happen again the following year and in 1999, by which time 3 of those teams had moved, the Quebec Nordiques to Denver, the Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix, and the Hartford Whalers to Raleigh.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Quebec Nordiques vs. (A4) Hartford Whalers.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams.\nThis was Hartford's lone playoff series victory in their NHL history prior to moving to Carolina.\n(A2) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A3) Boston Bruins.\nThis was the 21st playoff matchup and the third of nine consecutive playoff meetings between these two teams, with Montreal winning 18 of the 20 previous series. Montreal won the previous year in five games.\n(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (P4) New York Rangers.\nThis was the seventh playoff series meeting between these two teams. Both teams have split their previous six meetings. Philadelphia won last year's Patrick Division Semifinals in a three-game sweep.\n(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P3) New York Islanders.\nThis was the fourth playoff series between these two teams. New York Islanders won all three previous meetings over the past three seasons. New York won last year's Patrick Division Semifinals 3–2.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (N4) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThis was the seventh playoff series meeting between these two teams. Toronto won four of the previous six meetings. Their last meeting was in the 1967 Stanley Cup Semifinals, in which Toronto won in six games.\n(N2) Minnesota North Stars vs. (N3) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the seventh playoff series meeting between these two teams. Both teams split their previous six series. Minnesota won last year's Norris Division Semifinals in a three-game sweep.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S4) Vancouver Canucks.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams.\n(S2) Calgary Flames vs. (S3) Winnipeg Jets.\nThis was the second playoff series between these two teams. This was a rematch of last year's Smythe Division Semifinals, in which Winnipeg won 3–1.\nDivision finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A2) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A4) Hartford Whalers.\nThis was the second playoff series between these two teams. Montreal won the only previous meeting in a three-game sweep in the 1980 preliminary round.\nThe upstart Whalers pushed the eventual Stanley Cup Champions to the limit before falling. Claude Lemieux scored the series-winning overtime goal for Montreal.\n(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P4) New York Rangers.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N3) St. Louis Blues vs. (N4) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S2) Calgary Flames.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Edmonton won both previous meetings, including their most recent meeting in seven games in the 1984 Smythe Division Finals.\nThe deciding goal of game seven between the Oilers and Flames was scored five minutes into the third period when Edmonton's Steve Smith attempted a cross-ice pass from the side of his own net and the puck struck goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and went into the Edmonton goal. This goal is significant because it eliminated the Oilers from the playoffs and prevented them from possibly winning a third straight Stanley Cup. To date this is the Flames' only playoff series victory over the Oilers.\nConference finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference final.\n(A2) Montreal Canadiens vs. (P4) New York Rangers.\nThis series is best remembered for the third game, in which the Rangers badly outshot the Habs, but were stymied by Patrick Roy. Another Montreal rookie, Claude Lemieux, scored in overtime—his second overtime goal of the playoffs.\nClarence Campbell Conference final.\n(S2) Calgary Flames vs. (N3) St. Louis Blues.\nIn Game 6, the Flames led 4–1 after two periods and 5–2 early in the third, but the Blues came back to tie it and then won on an overtime goal by Doug Wickenheiser. In Game 7, the Flames were up 2–0 before the Blues scored in the third to cut the lead in half. There wouldn't be another comeback, though, as Mike Vernon and the Flames withstood a late assault to advance to their first Stanley Cup Finals.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams. This was the Canadiens' 32nd appearance in the Finals, while the Flames were making their first appearance in the Finals. Montreal had most recently won the Stanley Cup in 1979. The Flames became the first team to represent Calgary in the Finals since the 1923–24 Calgary Tigers who were defeated by the same Montreal Canadiens.\nIn game two Montreal's Brian Skrudland set an NHL and Stanley Cup Finals record for the quickest overtime goal in history, scoring just nine seconds into overtime to win the game for Montreal.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded."

        "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse team represents the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's lacrosse. North Carolina currently competes as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and plays its home games at Fetzer Field and Kenan Memorial Stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Their main rivalry series is with fellow ACC member Duke.\nOverview.\nA club team was established at the school in 1937, but didn't play until 1938. That team played until the start of World War II until another club team was established for the 1944 season. When lacrosse returned to campus in 1949, it was elevated to varsity status. Carolina rose to national prominence in the late 1970s under Hall of Fame coach and former Johns Hopkins Blue Jay Willie Scroggs. The program's first 1st-team All-American in Division I was defenseman Ralph \"Rip\" Davy in 1979. Between 1980 and 1996, the UNC lacrosse team qualified for the NCAA tournament 14 of the 16 years. During that span, Carolina also won 11 ACC titles. In 1981, the Tar Heels began a 26-game winning streak, and won the national championship in 1981, 1982 and 1986.\nThe UNC lacrosse program won its fifth national title in 2016, beating Maryland 14-13 in an overtime thriller. At 12-6 on the season, UNC entered the NCAA tournament unseeded at 8-6. They became the first unseeded national champion in the last 45 years. This is the first title since 1991, when they won their fourth national title, going undefeated on the season at 16-0. Since then, UNC won four of five ACC championship games between 1992 and 1996.\nHistory.\n1937–1954.\nThe first lacrosse team was formed in 1937 at the club level. At the time, they used old equipment from the football team and competed in the Dixie Lacrosse League against Duke, Virginia, Washington &amp; Lee, Loyola, and the Washington Lacrosse Club. The Tar Heels were the Dixie Lacrosse League champions for 1941. In 1949, the university conferred varsity status on the team, and in 1950, North Carolina became a member of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA). The following season, goalie Nick Sowell became the Tar Heels' first All-American when he was named to the USILA Honorable Mention team.\nIn 1954, after compiling a combined 14-43-1 record in its first six seasons, the varsity team was disbanded by the administration to focus on other sports.\n1964–1974.\nLacrosse returned as a varsity sport in 1964. In 1974, Paul Doty took over as head coach. That year, the school started awarding scholarships for the sport and was promoted from the small college level (now Division II and Division III) to Division I.\n1979–1990.\nIn 1979, William Scroggs became the head coach at North Carolina and led the Tar Heels to six ACC titles, three NCAA championships, and 11 appearances in the NCAA Tournament during a 12-year career. He compiled a record of 120-37 (.764) as the head coach at North Carolina, with NCAA titles in 1981, 1982, and 1986.\nScroggs led the Heels to 26 straight wins and two titles over the two years, 1981 and 1982. He would retire after a loss to Syracuse University in the Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament. From 1986 to 1990, Scroggs coached Joe Breschi, who later became the coach of the UNC Men's Lacrosse team.\n1991–2000.\nIn 1991, first-year head coach Dave Klarmann replaced Willie Scroggs and led the Tar Heels through an undefeated regular season. Carolina extended its winning streak throughout the postseason, first winning the ACC tournament, and then defeating Loyola, Syracuse, and Towson succeeding to post a perfect 16–0 mark and capture the NCAA national championship. Klarmann's teams repeated as ACC tournament champions in 1992 before advancing to the NCAA Championship semifinal, where they fell to third-seeded Princeton, 16-14. In 1993 and 1994, Carolina again captured the ACC title, but fell to Syracuse in the NCAA Championship 13-12 in 1993 and suffered an early exit in the 1994 NCAA tournament. In the late 1990s, the Tar Heels struggled, alternately, to qualify for or advance in the NCAA tournament.\nAt the end of the head coach's Dave Klarmann's time at UNC (10 years, one national championship, five ACC tournament championships) there were a series of off-the-field incidences between 1995 and 1999. One player died of a gunshot wound, another from asphyxiation, another was injured from a stabbing in a nightclub and a fourth had a serious illness.\n2001–2008.\nJohn Haus replaced Klarmann as head coach for the 2001 season. John Haus was UNC's head coach from 2001 to 2008. In his fourth year, Carolina advanced to the NCAA quarterfinals before losing to Johns Hopkins, 15–9. They returned to the NCAA tournament and quarterfinals in 2007, where they were defeated by second-seeded Duke, 19–11. In 2008, Carolina was knocked out of the first round by Navy.\n2009.\nIn 2009, alumnus Joe Breschi, a former first-team All-American defenseman in 1990 and USA national team member in 1990 and 1994, became head coach at his alma mater, after being a coach at Ohio State University. In Breschi's first season in 2009, North Carolina surprised many observers when the team returned to the NCAA quarterfinals, before losing to rival Duke 12-11. The lackluster performance as head coach from John Haus had brought many questions from fans on if UNC men's lacrosse could recover. Breschi took the challenge, and has completely rebuilt the program, transforming them into a top contender once again. Joe Breschi, Ryan Wade, Marcus Holman, Frank Riggs, Tommy Sears. Joey Sievold, Randy Cox, and Mac Ford are the only UNC players to play for the USA National Team.\n2010.\nIn 2010, \"The Baltimore Sun\" commented that \"it's no longer a question whether Breschi can rebuild North Carolina, but when the Tar Heels will arrive.\" In his second season, Carolina again advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to Duke, 17–9. That season, North Carolina swept the ACC postseason awards, with Breschi named ACC Coach of the Year, junior attackman Billy Bitter named ACC Player of the Year, and Marcus Holman named ACC Freshman of the Year.\n2012.\nUNC finished the 2012 season with an 11-6 record, for the sixth season in a row UNC had a winning record. UNC lost to Duke in the ACC Tournament final game. UNC received a #8 seed in the 16-team 2012 NCAA tournament. UNC lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to Denver 14-16. Denver lost in the next round to eventual champion Loyola (Md.). It was the second year in a row UNC lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n2013.\nUNC attained a #1 ranking in the 2013 season and won the ACC tournament.

        "text": "The Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse team represents Duke University in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's lacrosse. Duke currently competes as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and plays its home games at Koskinen Stadium in Durham, North Carolina. The principal rivalry of Duke is their all-sports nemesis North Carolina.\nHistory.\nThe first lacrosse game played by Duke took place on April 9, 1938, when the Blue Devils traveled to meet their nearby rivals, North Carolina, which itself had just formed a team the year prior. Duke won that contest, 2–1. The first home game occurred a week later when they hosted Syracuse, who beat the Blue Devils, 17–5. Duke finished the season with a 2–5 record, with their second win also over North Carolina, this time in Durham. The following season, the Blue Devils compiled a 7–1 mark and secured the Dixie Lacrosse League championship.\nRay Brown became Duke's first lacrosse All-American in 1940 and was honored as such again the following year. In 1946, Duke opened the season with an upset over national power Maryland in College Park, 12–4. Despite finishing the season with a 2–3 record, the Blue Devils were awarded the Southern Lacrosse Association championship.\nThe 1951 team is often regarded as one of Duke's most successful pre-NCAA teams. The Blue Devils routed conference opponent Washington &amp; Lee, 26–8. They also scored victories against powerhouses, beating Navy, 17–6, and Johns Hopkins, 9–7. The lone loss was by a one-goal margin and came against Virginia. Duke finished the season with a 6–1 record.\nThe newly formed Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) sanctioned lacrosse in 1954, and Duke captured the league's first title after posting a 7–1–1 season. Starting the following year, however, the Blue Devils entered a twelve-year slump where they compiled a combined 17–67 record with no winning seasons. In 1967, Roy Skinner and Bruce Corrie took over as co-head coaches and immediately reversed the team's fortunes, posting a 7–4 record that season and finishing second in the ACC. In 1971, Corrie became the sole coach after Skinner retired.\nMike Pressler was hired as head coach in 1991, and the following season Duke made its first NCAA tournament appearance. In 1994, the Blue Devils posted their first tournament win, which was also their first victory against Maryland in Durham since 1954. They were then edged, 12–11, in the quarterfinals by Syracuse. The next year, Duke won its first ACC tournament, and in the process became the first number-four seed to do so. Two years later, they advanced to the Final Four. Duke won consecutive ACC tournaments in 2001 and 2002, and advanced to the 2005 NCAA final before losing to Johns Hopkins, 9–8. The 2006 season was cut short when several Duke players were falsely accused of rape. As a result of the incident, Duke forced Pressler to resign as head coach, and the NCAA granted the players an extra season of eligibility.\nJohn Danowski replaced Pressler, and in his first season in 2007, he led the Blue Devils to the ACC championship and a return to the NCAA title game. Duke again lost to Johns Hopkins by one goal, 12–11. In 2010, Duke returned to the final, where it defeated Notre Dame, 6–5 in overtime, to capture its first NCAA championship.\nIn the 2013 season, Duke defeated Syracuse 16–10 to win their second NCAA lacrosse championship.\nIn the 2014 season, Duke defeated Notre Dame 11–9 to win their third NCAA lacrosse championship.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Duke's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:"

The Cup winner qualified for the Candidates stage of the World Chess Championship 2012. Boris Gelfand defeated Ruslan Ponomariov in the final.\nThe winner of the Chess World Cup 2007, Gata Kamsky, was defeated by Wesley So in the third round.\nFormat.\nMatches consisted of two games (except for the final, which consisted of four). Players had 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game with an addition of 30 seconds per move from move one. If the match was tied after the regular games, tie breaks were played on the next day. The format for the tie breaks was as follows:\nParticipants.\nThe players qualified for the event were:\nAll players are grandmasters unless indicated otherwise. The pairings of the 1st round (players were seeded according to their ratings) were announced on 2 November 2009, immediately after the publishing of the November rating list. The list of players who declined participation: Anand, Carlsen, Topalov, Aronian, Kramnik, Leko, Adams, Nakamura, and Ni Hua. Among them, Anand, Topalov and Aronian had already qualified for the Candidates or the Championship match; Carlsen, Kramnik, Nakamura, Adams and Ni had committed to play in the London Chess Classic on 7–15 December 2009.\nQualification paths:\nSummary of results.\nRound one.\nIn the first round of the tournament all of the top 30 seeded players progressed, with the sole exception of Slovakian Sergei Movsesian (16), who was eliminated by the Chinese 113th seed Yu Yangyi. Judit Polgár achieved a walkover, due to her opponent Duško Pavasovič withdrawing from the competition due to injury. The round was notable for the 16-game match between Pavel Tregubov and Varuzhan Akobian: after each winning with white over the first two days, their tiebreak held a marathon of four rapid games followed by ten blitz games. The two players fought until near 1 a.m. local time for the right to face Ruslan Ponomariov in the second round (which would start the next morning), Akobian finally achieving the decisive two-point advantage in the final bout before an Armageddon game would have been required.\nRound two.\nThe first day of Round Two included a number of upsets. The highest seed to have won their match was Alexander Grischuk (8), as Peter Svidler (3), Alexander Morozevich (4), Teimour Radjabov (5) and Vassily Ivanchuk (6) all lost and the remaining highest seeds (Gelfand, Gashimov and Ponomariov) drew. On the next day of matches, Morozevich, Radjabov and Ivanchuk were all eliminated, and exactly half of the matches went to tie-breaks. Of the 32 players to reach Round Three, all but seven players had been originally seeded in the top 32.\nRound three.\nSixteen-year-old Wesley So, who had upset Ivanchuk in Round Two, achieved another major upset, defeating Gata Kamsky, the 2007 winner, 1½-½. In the second rapid tiebreak, Chinese players Wang Yue and Li Chao were not at their seats for the start of the round, and lost the game, and their matches against Bacrot and Gashimov.\nRound four.\nThis round marked the departure of most of the youthful players from the World Cup. Wesley So (16), Fabiano Caruana (17) and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (19) were eliminated by the more experienced Malakhov, Gashimov and Gelfand respectively, leaving Sergey Karjakin the only under-20 player left in contention."

        "text": "The UMBC Retrievers men's lacrosse team represents the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's college lacrosse competition. The Retrievers play their home games at UMBC Stadium, located in Baltimore, Maryland with a capacity of 4,500 spectators. UMBC competes as a member of the America East Conference. The program has an all-time record of 373–344 including pre-NCAA results.\nHistory.\nThe University of Maryland, Baltimore County was founded in 1966, and athletic director and men's lacrosse coach Dick Watts started the first team in 1968 at the NCAA Division II level. The Retrievers advanced to the NCAA Division II championship finals in 1979 and 1980, winning the national title in 1980. In 1981, UMBC promoted its lacrosse team to the Division I level. Watts, however, struggled to build the team in the face of poor facilities and scheduling.\nIn 1989, newly hired athletic director Charlie Brown began campaigning for upgrades to UMBC Stadium, which finally came to fruition in 1996 with funding of $2.3 million. In 1993, UMBC increased its scholarship allotment from eight to the NCAA maximum of 12.6. That year, Watts resigned as head coach and was replaced by Don Zimmerman, who had previously led Johns Hopkins to three national championships. Early in his tenure at UMBC, Zimmerman and his staff had difficulty recruiting in their targeted region, New York. Of Zimmerman's initial 1994 recruiting class of nine, only two players remained at UMBC for the entirety of their collegiate career. In 1996, an increased strength of schedule led to a 3–9 finish for the Retrievers, which included a school record 27 goals allowed against Towson State. The UMBC staff landed some highly sought after Baltimore area recruits and transfers with the incentive of early playing time, including two \"Baltimore Sun\" Players of the Year in 1996. In 1997, UMBC improved to a 9–3 record, but missed the tournament because of a relatively weak schedule. The Retrievers entered the 1998 season with a No. 18 preseason ranking, and upset Maryland, 12–8, to clinch an invitation to the school's first NCAA Division I tournament as the No. 8 seed. UMBC returned to the tournament the following year.\nInto the 2000s, UMBC continued to grow as a nationally competitive team. The Retrievers won the America East Conference tournaments in 2006, 2008, and 2009, while being eliminated in the final in 2007. In 2007, UMBC upset seventh-seeded Maryland, 13–9, in the first round to advance to the NCAA tournament quarterfinals where they were eliminated by Delaware. The Retrievers finished the 2009 season with a 12–4 record, winning the America East tournament before being eliminated in the first round of the NCAA tournament by North Carolina.\nGoing into the 2010s, the Retrievers struggled as the Hartford Hawks and Albany Great Danes both rose as America East powers. During this time, the Retrievers finished with a winning record once, an 8–7 season in 2014. During this time, numerous players transferred out of the program, most notably Pat Young to Maryland in 2015. However, they did make the 2013 and 2014 America East Championship games, falling both times. In 2015, the Retrievers failed to make the conference tournament for the first time since joining the America East, and a similar finish in 2016 resulted in longtime coach Don Zimmerman retiring at the end of the season\nOn June 20, 2016, UMBC hired former Loyola Greyhound assistant Ryan Moran as head coach.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of UMBC's results by season since the institution of NCAA Division I in 1971:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus."

In 2016, Doyle was convicted of embezzling funds from the institute, and he is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence.\nEducation.\nA 1972 graduate of Bates College, Doyle also served as a trustee at Bates. Doyle received his master's degree in international relations from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. He holds honorary doctorates from Bridgewater State College and the University of Rhode Island.\nCoaching history.\nDoyle was an assistant men's basketball coach at Brown University, and head men's basketball coach at both Kingswood-Oxford School in Connecticut, and at Trinity College (Connecticut). He compiled an overall coaching record of 142–45, and in his last year at Trinity, where his team ended the season ranked 13th in the country, he was named New England College Coach of the Year. Doyle's skills development basketball clinic is now in its 20th year of operation. Doyle has received numerous awards, including the Terrance Cardinal Cooke Humanitarian Award and induction into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.\nWriting career.\nDoyle is the author of the novels, \"An African Rebound\" and \"Are You Watching, Adolph Rupp?\". With Deborah Doermann Burch, he also co-authored a non-fiction book,\"The Encyclopedia of Sports Parenting.\"\nPublic speaking roles.\nDoyle has been the principal speaker at over 450 functions, including major addresses at a White House conference on ethics, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick's dinner in Scranton, Pennsylvania (where past speakers have included two U.S. Presidents, two Irish Prime Ministers and many U.S. Senators), and the keynote speaker at over 125 American colleges and universities, delivered on behalf of the NCAA Foundation.\nInstitute for International Sport Investigation.\nA March 4, 2012 article, \"Shadowed by Debt\" by Katherine Gregg of the Providence Journal provided a detailed look at the unconventional relationship Dan Doyle had formed with the University of Rhode Island with the blessing of many top officials. The article cited numerous internal memos and documents obtained by the Journal showing a history back to the mid 1980s when the Institute first appeared at the University.\nThe Providence Journal reported Doyle had been acquiring properties on Bald Head Island, NC. Reporter Tom Mooney travelled to the island where Doyle's nonprofit Institute for International Sport had acquired two vacation homes and four house lots for $2.95 million. Doyle also bought a house lot on his own and four more through a partnership with his Bates College classmate, Deborah Burch, who records show, lives about three hours away in Durham, NC. The purchases totaled $1.39 million.\nOn March 14, 2012 the Providence Journal reported ex-staffers of the Institute for International Sport said Dan Doyle had used Institute funds to pay for his daughters college tuition at Oberlin College another other personal expenses including credit card bills.\nOn April 21, 2012 University of Rhode Island President David M. Dooley told the Providence Journal the University will hire a consultant to conduct a “comprehensive review” of relationships the university has with outside organizations and a lawyer to help URI deal with the probe of the Institute for International Sport. Dooley said he still wants the “independent examination of the university’s relationship and transactions with the Institute for International Sport,” which he announced in February and then put on hold at the urging of the state police. But that, he said, will come later. “As I have stated previously, we will not compromise the ongoing investigation by the state police. Our own important review will proceed once the work of law enforcement is complete,” he said Friday. “It has been my experience over the past three years that occurrences such as those associated with the Institute for International Sport are the exception at URI,” Dooley said in his statement. On June 1, 2012 the Associated Press reported URI had hired Providence attorney John \"Terry\" MacFadyen to assist URI's own lawyer with any legal issues pertaining to the Institute for International Sport. URI said through a spokeswoman MacFadyen would be paid $200/hr.\nFebruary 12, 2013 a year after the scandal first broke, the Providence Journal reported the University of Rhode Island hasn't begun their promised probes of the Institute for International Sport. A year after the state police began investigating Daniel Doyle and his Institute for International Sport, the University of Rhode Island has not yet launched either of the in-depth probes its president promised in the early days of the scandal. One was canceled; the other has yet to get off the ground. URI President David M. Dooley promised in February 2012 to bring in an outsider to conduct an “independent, impartial examination” of the school's relationship with the Institute. But days later, Dooley reversed course, saying it would hold off on its inquiry until “the work of law enforcement is complete.” \nWPRI 12 reported on February 26, 2014 the Sports Institute lost its Tax Exempt status last year according to IRS however a website for the Institute indicates the organization is still accepting donations. WPRI also reported URI has leased the land the Institute buildings sit on to the Institute until 2017 for $1. The Institute owns the buildings. \"We wanted to ask Doyle about whether the Institute was still receiving donations. The vehicle he was seen driving was parked in a handicapped spot in front of the Institute’s office in Kingston, indicating he was in the building. No one answered the door, but Doyle did acknowledge us from the second floor. He then closed the window with a chuckle.\"\nArrest.\nDan Doyle was arrested and indicted on May 3, 2013, in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island State Police, and accused by the Rhode Island Attorney General's office of embezzling more than $1 million from his foundation, the Institute for International Sport. An article in the \"Hartford Courant\" by Matthew Kauffman reports on claims by the prosecutors that Doyle is responsible for massive embezzlement at the Institute for International Sport and claiming ties to various figures including the Irish government which do not actually exist. Doyle is fighting the charges at this time.\nDoyle was indicted on 18 counts.\nFebruary 22, 2014 Providence Journal reports more than 90 potential witnesses may be called at the trial including many prominent political figures, businessmen and university officials. The list includes former URI president Robert Carothers, current state Director of Administration Richard Licht, former House speaker William Murphy, former attorney general Patrick Lynch, former congressman and URI administrator Robert Weygand and philanthropist Alan Hassenfeld, the former CEO of toy maker Hasbro who was once the Institute's biggest supporter.\nThe list also includes former state senator John Revens, former Senate president now Judge Joseph Montabano, former Democratic Party chairman William J. Lynch, who did legal work for the Institute, dozens of URI finance and administration officials, and a host of former Institute employees.\nThe article says former University of Rhode Island President Robert Carothers seemed surprised the case was going to trial. \"I would have thought there would be a plea deal.”\nDoyle was found guilty on all 18 charges of fraud and embezzlement on Monday, December 5, 2016 "

        "title": "Aberdeenshire Cricket Club",
        "text": "Aberdeenshire CC is the largest cricket club based in Aberdeen, Scotland. Their ground, Mannofield Park, is located in the Mannofield area of Aberdeen, and was granted One Day International (ODI) status for the first time in 2008. The club has around 800 social and playing members and the current president is Stuart Grant.\nAberdeenshire Cricket Club currently has Three senior teams (Strathmore Union, Aberdeen Grade 1, Grade 3) and a host of junior teams (Softball Cricket, U11, U12 U13, U14, U15, U16 and U17).\nSince 2022 the club has become home to the Northern Lights woman's team who currently play in the Woman's Premier League. \nHistory.\nAlthough teams played as \"Aberdeenshire\" as early as 1848, the birth of Aberdeenshire Cricket Club took place in April 1857 at a public meeting held in \"The Aberdeen Hotel\". The £60 raised then enabled the founding spirit, James Forbes Lumsden, to lease and prepare a cricket ground at Queen’s Cross to be called the Albyn Place Ground. Within two seasons the club was established enough to entertain Grange C.C. and to employ its first professional: Harry Lillywhite.\nThe growth of Aberdeen soon brought the end of the lease at Queen’s Cross but by July 1867, James Forbes Lumsden had repeated the earlier exercise of leasing and laying out a cricket ground, this time in Broomhill and at a cost of £245. Over the following twenty three years the Holburn Ground as it was called, enabled Aberdeenshire Cricket Club to establish itself as a top club both locally and beyond. However by the 1880’s the continuing expansion of the town coupled with the fragility of having just an annual lease prompted the aforesaid James Forbes Lumsden, still Club Captain and Secretary (as well as being a respected lawyer), to seek to purchase a ground. Land at Mannofield was chosen, purchased (for £1105), laid out (for £483) and on May 9, 1890, was opened with a game against \"The Gentlemen of Edinburgh\". The financing of Mannofield was organised and, not a little funded, by James Williams (a whisky blender in Aberdeen and who probably played more games for Aberdeenshire in the 19th century than anyone else) and by his brother Sir Robert Williams, (an engineer who made a fortune in the goldfields of South Africa and who made his fame by building the railway for Cecil Rhodes from Southern Rhodesia - Zimbabwe to-day - to Angola).\nThe confidence brought by ownership of Mannofield enabled the Club to attract the top teams to Aberdeen and, now under the guiding hand of Secretary W. Kendall Burnett (another successful lawyer), to push towards a Scottish Cricket Competition. The Scottish Counties Championship commenced in 1902, and, in the following year, in dramatic circumstances, Aberdeenshire won its first SC Championship. The Mannofield XI (at that time termed the \"occasional\" side) entered the already well established local league and cup competitions in1908 and within two seasons won the District League.\nIn 1912, the club, needing to engender more income, through a bar and better members’ facilities, decided to replace the old clubhouse. (It had been transferred from the Holburn Ground). It was completed just in time for the outbreak of World War 1. Cricket ceased at Mannofield and, by 1918, the ground had been turned into sheep pasture! Club membership dropped to 2 and the bank fearing for its loan on the new and almost unused Clubhouse threatened closure. Once more, and after 60 years of service to Aberdeenshire CC, James Forbes Lumsden saw the Club out of the near disaster of impending insolvency.\nOn the pitch the 1920s were highly successful for Aberdeenshire, but some management over-optimism and, at that time, a very high Entertainment Tax, once more threatened the club’s future. This time, the ClubChairman, C.W.Mackie (a merchant in tropical products from Ceylon (Sri Lanka)) organised what turned out to be an incredibly successful \"bazaar\" to the extent that, for the first time since the Holburn days, Aberdeenshire had no debt. This enabled the Club to gradually acquire land on the north side as it became available; to seriously develop junior cricket; and, reaping the rewards of the latter, to have a Mannofield XI strong enough to join, and quickly become, a major force in the Strathmore Union. The 2nd World War did not cause cricket to cease, and with a modified competition being organised locally, Mannofield became the home of several forces teams as well as the Mannofield side. When cricket returned to normal in 1946, the club entered a period of unparalleled success with Aberdeenshire winning the Scottish Counties Championship for four consecutive seasons and the Mannofield XI winning the Strathmore Union in 1949.\nIn 1957, the club celebrated its centenary with a game against Surrey (then the English Counties Champions). The occasion was also marked by Sir John Hay, (who was then Managing Director of Guthrie Bros, rubber producers in Malaya - now Malaysia) and also President of Surrey C.C., setting up a large trust fund for the benefit of Aberdeenshire C.C., the club he had attended as a youngster. The benefits of his generosity are still evident at Mannofield fifty years on.\nTwenty six years without a Counties Championship was ended in 1975 and this success was to herald a quarter of a century of outstanding achievement within the club. The existing clubhouse (of 1912 vintage) was enlarged and the interior totally renewed; the \"old\" tearoom (from 1920) was revamped to become The Cavalier Bar: and then a snooker room was added. The Committee’s boldness was soon justified when the membership rose from around 175 to over 800 within three years. (This latter number has continued to the present day).\nIn the 1990’s the club undertook two more major developments. Office and flat accommodation at the corner of the ground was purchased with a view to diversifying the club’s income. Then it was decided to replace the Cavalier Bar with a much larger and better equipped function area to allow larger functions and company training days to also broaden the club’s income base. The name Bradman Suite was chosen for the development to mark the occasion, when, at Mannofield, almost exactly fifty years earlier, Sir Donald Bradman had led the 1948 Australian Touring side, and scored his last first class century. On the playing front the period was also one of great success. Founded on a well-run and stable coaching set-up which produced a stream of good players, the Scottish Counties Championship was won regularly, the Scottish Cup was won in 1986 and 1996, and, when the first \"Scottish Cricket League\" was started, Aberdeenshire triumphed in the first season (1996).\nInto the 21st century the club continues to develop, celebrated its 150th year in 2007 and in 2008 Mannofield became a fully accredited I.C.C. one-day-international ground.\nAt the 2008 Lloyds TSB Scotland SNCL awards, Aberdeenshire received the Magners Club of the Year Award in addition to the flag as Division 1 winners. Ken McCurdie also received the Groundsman of the Year, in recognition of his efforts in connection with the staging of One-Day Internationals at Mannofield for the first time.\nAberdeenshire featured in Sky Sports 'Clublife' series during the 2008 summer of England Test matches. The show saw the team coached by Ian Botham before featuring in, and eventually win, a Twenty20 tournament in Windsor.\nSeason of 2009 was a historic season in Aberdeenshire Cricket Club's history. The club won the SNCL Premier League and the Scottish Cup. This was the first time in 13 years since the club won a league and cup double, and the 1st time in its history since it has won the SNCL Premier League.\nBadge and Colours.\nIn 1893/4 Aberdeenshire CC employed the services of future England Test cricketer Schofield Haigh.\nHaigh joined the Aberdeen team from Yorkshire where he played his First Class cricket.\nThe importance of this signing was shown by ACC’s much debated agreement of club colours which had previously not been set.\nAs Yorkshires traditional colours were set as blue and yellow the club decided that from that point and ever since our colours have been, Cambridge Blue, Oxford Blue and Yellow.\nWe are very proud of our history and we wished to promote our colours which were laid down by our forefathers in the form of our present day playing attire.\nHome ground.\nMannofield Park in the Mannofield district of Aberdeen, Scotland is the regular home of the Scotland national cricket team and Aberdeenshire Cricket Club. It is also known as Citylets Mannofield for international fixtures.\nThe ground has also played host to 12 One Day Internationals, the first of which came in the 2008 Associates Tri-Series in Scotland when Ireland played New Zealand. The last One Day International to date came in May 2014 when Scotland lost to England.\nThe current Groundsman of Aberdeenshire CC is Calum Graeme Howard of Huntly, Aberdeenshire."

He played at representative level for Great Britain, England, Rugby League XIII and Yorkshire, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage No. 333) and Leeds as a , i.e. number 2 or 5, and coached at club level for Featherstone Rovers.\nBackground.\nStanley Smith worked as a foreman at a stone quarry in Tadcaster.\nPlaying career.\nClub career.\nSmith started his career at Wakefield Trinity before he was transferred to Leeds during January 1930 for a record fee of £1,075, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £307,200 in 2014). Smith played , i.e. number 5, in Leeds' 2–8 defeat by Hunslet in the Championship Final during the 1937–38 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 30 April 1938.\nSmith retired from first class rugby in January 1940 having played for Leeds for 10 years. He had a long-standing plan to retire from rugby so that he and his wife Hilda could focus on running their pub the Butchers Arms on Williams Street in Wakefield but the outbreak of WWII saw him joining the Army at the age of 30. Stan served in the REME seeing service throughout the North African and Italian campaigns and returning home in late 1945.\nInternational honours.\nStan Smith won caps for England while at Leeds in 1931 against Wales, in 1932 against Wales (2 matches), in 1934 against Australia, and France, in 1935 against France, and won caps for Great Britain while at Wakefield Trinity in 1929 against Australia, while at Leeds in 1930 against Australia (2 matches), in 1932 against Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand (3 matches), and in 1933 against Australia (2 matches).\nStan Smith played twice for an Rugby League XIII against France. Playing at left-wing on both occasions, the first was at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on 17 March 1934 when the English team won 32–16, this game was also the first international match played by the France national rugby league team. The second was at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds just over a year later, on 6 May 1935 when the English side won 25–18.\nCounty honours.\nStan Smith won cap(s) for Yorkshire while at Wakefield Trinity.\nCounty Cup Final appearances.\nStanley Smith played , i.e. number 5, in Leeds' 14–8 victory over Huddersfield in the 1937–38 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1937–38 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 30 October 1937.\nThe record for the most tries in a Yorkshire County Cup Final is 4-tries, and is jointly held by; Stan Moorhouse, Alan Smith, and Stanley Smith.\nGenealogical information.\nStan had family links to several well known rugby players, notably in the Batten and Metcalfe families. Stan's mother Selena and Billy Batten's wife Annie were sisters so Billy was Stan's uncle by marriage and Billy's rugby playing sons, Billy (Jr), Eric and Bob, and his grandson Ray were Stan's cousins. \nWhilst a player at Trinity Stan became good friends with his teammate Jimmy Metcalfe the son of James Davis Metcalfe who played at full back for Trinity in the period 1897-1911. Jimmy (Jr) introduced Stan to his sister Hilda and the two were married in 1932. Jimmy's (Jr) son Donald Metcalfe, played for Trinity in the 1950s and was Stan's nephew by marriage.\nNote.\nDuring the late 1950/60s there was a rugby league footballer who played for Wakefield Trinity, and Bramley, who was also called Stanley \"Stan\" Smith. These Stanley \"Stan\" Smith's are clearly not the same person and they are not related."

        "text": "John Evans (23 February 1871 – 19 July 1924) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who later 'went North', switching to the professional rugby league code. Evans played for several teams, but is most notable for playing club rugby for Llanelli, and international rugby for Wales.\nRugby career.\nEvans first played club rugby for his hometown club of Ammanford, before switching to first class Welsh club Llanelli. It was while representing Llanelli that Evans was first selected to play for Wales, in the second game of the 1896 Home Nations Championship. Evans came into a pack along with four other new caps, a reaction by the Welsh selectors to the terrible defeat by England in the previous game. The new players were chosen for their rough physical style of play, and were dubbed 'Rhondda forwards' after the tough coal playing men from that area. The initial decision worked, with Wales winning 6-0 against Scotland at the Cardiff Arms Park. Evans was reselected for the third and final game of the Championship, an away game to Ireland. This time the new forward strategy was not successful with the Irish kick-and-rush tactics, and Wales lost 4-8. Despite the loss Evans was re-selected for the only game Wales played in the 1897 Home Nations Championship. The match saw Wales beat England by a record amount, but due to the Gould affair, Wales left the International Rugby Board, and could not play in any further international games.\nIn 1897, Evans moved to the Rhondda where he joined valley team Llwynypia, although not a 'Rhondda forward' when first capped for Wales, by the time his international career had ended he was a Rhondda collier. When the next Wales international was played, Evans' position was taken by Hopkin Davies, and Evans was not selected to play for Wales again. It is recorded that Evans eventually switched codes, to professional rugby league joining Swinton RLFC in October 1897, as a forward (prior to the specialist positions of; ), during the era of contested scrums. Both of his sons, Jack and Bryn played rugby league during the 1920s and 1930s.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

He scored 38 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a semifinal win over Louisville, then scored 28 points and snared 11 boards against California in the title game.

The men's knockout games and the women's games, from semifinals onward were played in the North Greenwich Arena.\nThe US men's and US women's teams both successfully defended their Olympic basketball championships of 2008.\nSettings.\nTwo settings in London were used for the basketball tournaments: The O2 Arena (referred to as the \"North Greenwich Arena\" during the Olympics) and the Basketball Arena in Olympic Park at Stratford. The North Greenwich Arena was the setting for the knockout stages for the men, and also from the semifinal games onward for the women, whereas the Basketball Arena was the setting for the preliminary rounds and the women's quarterfinals.\nQualification.\nThe National Olympic Committees may enter up to one 12-player men's team and up to one 12-player women's team.\nHost.\nInitially, basketball was the only team sport in which the host country was not automatically awarded a team in the tournament. This was because the British basketball teams did not exist until 2006, and hence FIBA, the world's regulatory body of basketball, was concerned about the future of the British national basketball teams after 2012, as well as the probable lack of competitiveness of the British teams. However, in a meeting held in Lyon, France, on 13 March 2011, the FIBA's executive board agreed to allow the two British teams to enter automatically after all.\nCompetition format.\nTwelve qualified nations were drawn into two groups, each consisting of six teams. Each game result merits a corresponding point:\nIn case teams are tied on points, the tiebreaking criteria are, in order of first application:\nThe teams with the four best records qualified for the knockout stage, which was a single-elimination tournament. The semifinal winners contested for the gold medal, while the losers played for the bronze medal.\nMen's competition.\nThe draw for the groups of the men's tournament was made on 30 April 2012. Included are the teams' FIBA World Rankings prior to the tournament.\nWomen's competition.\nThe draw for the groups of the women's tournament was made on 30 April 2012.

The undefeated and second-ranked Stanford Indians of the Pacific Coast Conference defeated the #7 Nebraska Cornhuskers of the Big Six Conference, 21–13.\nThis was Nebraska's first bowl game and the eighth for Stanford, all in the Rose Bowl. Through 2020, it remains the only meeting between these football programs. This was the last edition of the Rose Bowl to feature a team from the Big Eight (now Big 12) until 2002.\nTeams.\nNebraska Cornhuskers.\nNebraska was 8–1 going into the Rose Bowl and ranked seventh in the nation; their only blemish was a 13–7 loss at top-ranked Minnesota, who did not play in a bowl game. After the announcement of the Rose Bowl acceptance, the celebration that followed lasted for 24 hours in Lincoln, according to newspaper reports. University classes were canceled, and students stormed the state capitol, demanding that the governor lead the singing of the school song, \"There Is No Place Like Nebraska.\" Led by fourth-year head coach Biff Jones, the Cornhuskers had two All-Americans: Warren Alfson and Forrest Behm.\nStanford Indians.\nStanford was led by first-year head coach Clark Shaughnessy, who brought a revolutionary football style called the T formation.\nThis new style of playing was filled with tricks, fakes, and pitchouts that helped the Indians to a perfect 9–0 regular season and a nickname of the \"Wow Boys\", a nod to Stanford's \"Vow Boys\" teams of the mid-1930s. The new features of the style involved quarterback Frankie Albert taking the snap directly from the center.\nThe season before, the 1939 Stanford varsity had been winless in their seven conference games under seventh-year head coach Tiny Thornhill and finished 1–7–1 overall.\nGame summary.\nHighlight of the game.\nThe highlight of the game is often considered to be one of the best plays in Rose Bowl history. The Indians drove from their own 23-yard line to the Cornhusker one-yard line before a valiant goal-line stand by Nebraska denied Stanford the end zone. Stanford had four cracks at the end zone from the one-yard line, but the Cornhuskers held each time.\nTrailing by one point late in the third quarter, Nebraska took over on their own one and opted to punt on first down, which started the play of the game. Kmetovic took the punt at the Cornhusker 40-yard line and dashed and darted his way to the end zone, giving Stanford a 21–13 lead, which was the final score.\nStatistics.\nNote: Both schools report slightly different stats, these stats are from Nebraska's records\nAftermath.\nThis game is generally considered the clincher that convinced football pundits that the T formation style was the offense of the future.\nAs the program's first bowl, the game retains a special place in Cornhuskers history; Hall of Fame head coach Bob Devaney arrived in 1962 and used to joke that he'd been in the state several years before he found out that Nebraska had actually \"lost\" the 1941 Rose Bowl.\nIn popular culture.\nThis game is described in detail by David Dodge in his mystery novel, \"Shear the Black Sheep\", published in 1942."

        "text": "The 2010 NCAA Division I lacrosse tournament was the 40th annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of men's college lacrosse among its Division I programs, held at the end of the 2010 NCAA Division I men's lacrosse season. The tournament was held from May 15–31, 2010.\nDuke defeated Notre Dame Fighting in the final, 6–5 in overtime, capturing the Blue Devil's first men's lacrosse championship.\nThe championship game was played at M&amp;T Bank Stadium, the home of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, in Baltimore, Maryland, with a crowd of 37,126 fans.\nVenues.\nBaltimore, Maryland was selected as the host for the final and semifinals, which were held at M&amp;T Bank Stadium, the home field of the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. The tournament was co-hosted by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Johns Hopkins University, Loyola University Maryland, and Towson University. Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York and Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey hosted the quarterfinals.\nIn order to host the event, Baltimore competed against Boston; Denver; Columbus, Ohio; and East Rutherford, New Jersey. Baltimore promoted its strong lacrosse heritage and M&amp;T Bank Stadium's close proximity to a wide range of hotels, restaurants, and shopping centers.\nQualifying.\nSixteen teams were selected to compete in the tournament based upon their performance during the regular season, and for some, a conference tournament.\nThe championship teams of six conferences were granted automatic tournament berths. Five of those were based upon the results of conference tournaments. The Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) did not hold a conference tournament and granted its automatic qualifier to regular season champions Denver. Conference tournament champions that automatically qualified were: Army of the Patriot League, Delaware of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), Mount Saint Mary's of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), Princeton of the Ivy League, and Stony Brook of the America East Conference.\nThe selection committee granted the other ten tournament teams at-large berths. All four Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) teams received at-large bids for the fourth straight year: Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Duke. Two berths were filled by the Big East Conference: Syracuse and Notre Dame. Ivy League runners-up Cornell, independent Johns Hopkins, Loyola of the ECAC, and Hofstra of the CAA were also selected.\nNotable teams considered to be \"on the bubble\" for selection, but not chosen, included Georgetown and Villanova of the Big East, Yale and Brown of the Ivy League, Drexel and UMass of the CAA. The selection of some at-large teams such as Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins instead of Georgetown, which missed the tournament for the third straight season, was considered a questionable snub by some analysts.\nGame summaries.\nFirst round.\nThe biggest surprise of the first round was Army's double-overtime upset of No. 2 seed Syracuse at the Carrier Dome. Some analysts ranked it among the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament. It was Army's first tournament win since 1993 and just the second home playoff loss for Syracuse since the tournament's inception; the other occurred in the 1991 semifinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nNotre Dame pulled off a second straight upset over No. 3 Maryland 7-5 after ousting No. 6 Princeton in the first round. The Irish qualified for the semifinals for only the second time in school history. Their only other appearance came in 2001. Duke ran away with a 17–9 win over rival North Carolina after a 6-goal spurt in the second half. It marks the fourth consecutive semifinal appearance for the Blue Devils and third NCAA quarterfinal victory over North Carolina in the last four years. Cornell quickly put an end to Army's hopes of another upset, racing out to a 4–0 lead in an eventual 14–5 victory. With the victory, the Big Red advanced to the Final Four for the second consecutive year.\nSemifinals.\nNotre Dame vs. Cornell.\nIn the first semifinal, Notre Dame once again used its stifling defense led by goalie Scott Rodgers to beat a third straight seeded opponent in No. 7 Cornell. The Irish led 6–3 at half time but two straight goals in the third quarter pulled Cornell to within two at 7–5. It was as close as the Big Red would get, however, as the Irish finished with a flurry to win 12–7. The win marked the first time that an unseeded team had reached the championship game since UMass in 2006. It also marked the first time in school history that Notre Dame advanced to the title game.\nDuke vs. Virginia.\nIn the second semifinal, No. 5 Duke upset No. 1 Virginia. After leading 7–5 at halftime, Virginia scored first in the second half to take an 8–5 lead, but Duke responded with a seven-goal blitz that made it 12–8 in favor of the Blue Devils early in the fourth quarter. Virginia would not go quietly, however, as the Cavaliers tied the game at 13 with just over a minute to play. With just 12 seconds left, Duke scored with the familiar combination of Ned Crotty to Max Quinzani to send Duke to its third championship game in six years.\nChampionship.\nNotre Dame vs. Duke.\nThe championship game featured two schools who had never won a national title before, the first time that had happened since 1973. This guaranteed that a first-time Division I lacrosse champion would be crowned, something that had not happened since Princeton in 1992. The game proved to be one of the closest championship contests ever, albeit the lowest scoring one as well. Neither team ever led by more than a single goal throughout the contest. After trailing 3–2 at halftime, Notre Dame took its first lead since the first minute of the game early in the fourth quarter. Duke tied the game a few minutes later, though, and had a chance to win in the final seconds of regulation, but stellar defense by Notre Dame and timely saves by tournament MVP Scott Rodgers sent the game to overtime. The slow pace of regulation did not continue into overtime, as Duke Sophomore CJ Costabile, a long stick midfielder, won the opening faceoff cleanly and sprinted straight downfield to score just 5 seconds into the extra period. The goal set the record for the fastest to end an overtime in NCAA championship history, and gave Duke its first national title in school history.\nPost-tournament honors.\nAfter the championship, Duke attackman Ned Crotty was honored with the Tewaaraton Trophy for the most outstanding Division I men's lacrosse player. The NCAA announced the All-Tournament team after the championship. Scott Rodgers, goalie for runner-up Notre Dame, was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament, the first time a player from the losing team had won the honor since 1996. The full team included four players from champion Duke, three from runner-up Notre Dame, two from semifinalist Virginia, and one from semifinalist Cornell. The following individuals were named to that team:"

        "title": "Rugby union in the Australian Capital Territory",
        "text": "Rugby union is a popular sport in the Australian Capital Territory. Rugby football began to be played in the regions around what is now Canberra more than a century ago.\nHistory.\nRugby union was established in the area around what is now the Australian Capital Territory well before it separated from New South Wales on 1 January 1911. Teams playing in the 19th century include Goulburn Rugby Union Club which was formed in 1872 and became a founding member of the Southern Rugby Union in 1874. Cooma played Snowy River as early as 1876, and Queanbeyan played Yass in 1878.\nThe first match of the 1899 British Lions tour was held at the Goulburn Showgrounds, and the Central Southern RFU put up a strong showing before the visitors prevailed 11–3. Central Southern beat the reigning Sydney premiers Glebe the following year.\nBeginnings.\nA team from Hall was playing rugby by 1907. Royal Military College, Duntroon played the game from the year it was founded in 1911. The Federal City Club also played rugby union prior to the First World War, including matches against a Glenlee team from Bungendore and the Rovers and Warrigal clubs from Queanbeyan.\nThe dominant rugby code in the region after the first world war was rugby league. Although Royal Military College remained with rugby union, matches had to be arranged with Sydney teams for the college to play the game. A Federal Capital Territory (FCT) branch of the NSW Rugby Union was founded in 1927, but there was not sufficient support for the union code to warrant the establishment of a formal competition. Royal Military College played a series of matches that year against the newly-formed Canberra Rugby Union Club instead. The Canberra club had adopted a black and white strip.\nThe FCT Rugby Union had to be re-established in 1930, and re-established again in 1937. It was renamed the Australian Capital Territory Rugby Union in 1939. No rugby union matches were played in Canberra for the five years prior to 1936, in the period when the Royal Military College was forced to relocate to the Victoria Barracks, Sydney due to the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression. After returning to Duntroon, the Military College played a re-formed Canberra Rugby Club in 1937, ten years after the teams had first met.\nThe First Grade competition was started in 1938 with four clubs playing in the inaugural season. The Territory's representative team hosted the All Blacks at Manuka Oval in 1938, with the New Zealanders winning by 57–5.\nGrowth of amateur rugby: 1946 to 1995.\nRugby union expanded quickly after World War II, particularly in New South Wales. The Australian Capital Territory team grew in stature through the 1950s and 1960s as part of the NSW Country Rugby Union. ACT won the Caldwell Cup for the Country Championship for the first time in 1964 and went on to win it three times in a row. In 1966, five Canberra players were chosen in the squad for the Combined NSW Country team that gave the touring British Lions team a physical match, losing narrowly by 6–3 in front of a record crowd at Manuka Oval.\nThe 1970s was a breakthrough decade. The ACT claimed their first win over an international side, defeating Tonga by 17-6 in 1973. ACT Rugby Union separated from NSW Country after the 1974 season and became directly affiliated to the Australian Rugby Football Union. In 1975 the ACT team won promotion to top division of the Wallaby Trophy, Australia's provincial championship at the time. The triumph was cut short, however, as the tournament was cancelled in that season. In 1978, the ACT defeated the reigning Five Nations champions Wales at Manuka Oval, showing that they could compete with some of the world's best players.\nAfter the ACT team had comprehensively beaten New South Wales in 1994, an invitation was issued for a Canberra club to play in the NSWRU Premiership for the following season. The ACT Rugby Union formed the Canberra Kookaburra Rugby Club in August 1994, with the Tuggeranong Vikings RUC as underwriters.\nBrumbies.\nThe Brumbies are the Australian Capital Territory's professional rugby union team and have competed in the transnational Super Rugby competition since the start of the professional era of rugby in 1996.\nCompetitions.\nSuper Rugby.\nThe Brumbies play in the Super Rugby competition against other professional teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and now also Argentina and Japan. The Brumbies have won the Super Rugby competition twice (2001 and 2004), and finished as runner-up four times (1997, 2000, 2002, 2013).\nNational Rugby Championship.\nThe ACT had one team in the National Rugby Championship (NRC), before the competition was stopped:\nACTRU Premier Division.\nThe Premier Division is contested in and around Canberra across four senior grades and three colts competitions. Club Championship trophies are also contested on overall results. The John I Dent Cup is the trophy for the first grade premiership competition, and the seven clubs currently competing for the premiership are:\nThe John I Dent Cup, which was first played for in 1938, was a gift to the union by the pastoralist John I Dent. The competition finals are now held at Viking Park."

The CEO of DHC is Yoshiaki Yoshida - one of the biggest supporters of the sport of bowling in Japan. DHC LBT started up in 2005, and was sanctioned by the Japan Professional Bowling Association (JPBA).\nIn addition to the Tour's tournaments, DHC also hosted the DHC Cup Girls Bowling International, at the time the third-biggest tournament for women in the world, just behind the Women's U.S. Open and the USBC Queens. The DHC members also competed in other non-DHC events, such as P★League.\nAccording to DHC's web site, the Tour was canceled, citing various circumstances. In May 2010, DHC officially separates itself from the JPBA, by announcing it will be the major sponsor of the \"LBO Ladies Bowling Tour\", and will be operated by the Ladies Bowling Organization of Japan. The JPBA and LBO are currently competing professional leagues. As of June 2010, twelve bowlers resigned from the JPBA and moved over to the LBO - including Hiroko Shimizu and Mai Takasaka."

        "text": "Paul Luther Snyder (June 11, 1935 – November 30, 2023) was an American front-office executive in Major League Baseball. He played an integral role in the rise and sustained dominance of the Atlanta Braves that began in and continued into the first decade of the 21st century, as the team's longtime amateur scouting director (1981–90; 1999–2000), assistant to the general manager (1991–95; 2001–06), and director of player development (1977–80; 1996–98).\nIn recognition of Snyder's career accomplishments, \"Baseball America\" named him one of the top 25 people in the game on the publication's 25th anniversary in 2006.\nLife and career.\nPaul Luther Snyder was born in Dallastown, Pennsylvania on June 11, 1935. He spent his entire 50-year professional baseball career in the Braves' organization, signing with them as an outfielder and first baseman in 1958 when the team was still based in Milwaukee. As a player, Snyder never reached the Major Leagues, peaking at the Triple-A level in 1963 with the Denver Bears of the Pacific Coast League — a season which also saw his debut as a minor league manager in the Braves' farm system. Snyder, however, was a strong hitter in his playing days, compiling a lifetime batting average of .318 during his seven-year active career. In his finest over-all campaign, 1962 with the Austin Senators of the Double-A Texas League, Snyder hit .312 with 19 home runs and 113 RBI in 132 games played. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood 6'2\" (1.9 m) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg).\nSnyder managed Braves' farm clubs and scouted for them between 1963 and 1972. In 1973, he joined the team's front office as assistant minor league administrator before taking the reins of the Braves' farm department in 1977. Working with then-general managers Bill Lucas and John Mullen, Snyder was a major architect of the Braves' strong early 1980s teams under manager Joe Torre—despite having suffered a stroke at age 40 that required brain surgery and an extensive period of rehabilitation.\nWhen the MLB Braves went through a prolonged rebuilding process after winning the National League West Division championship, Snyder, by now scouting director, assisted general manager Bobby Cox in drafting and developing the talent base—players such as Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, David Justice, Jeff Blauser and Chipper Jones—that served as the foundation for the Braves' string of first-place teams of the 1990s through , including the 1995 world champions. He also served as a top assistant to John Schuerholz when he took over the Atlanta front office after the season and performed several key functions in the Braves' baseball operations department in addition to working as scouting or player development director.\nSnyder retired from the Braves after the season, which saw Schuerholz move upstairs to the team presidency and a new general manager, Frank Wren, assume control of baseball operations. In 2005, he was inducted into the Braves Museum and Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was presented with the King of Baseball award given by Minor League Baseball. In 2013, he was selected for the Professional Baseball Scouts Hall of Fame.\nSnyder died on November 30, 2023, at the age of 88."

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Wales, and at club level for Aberavon and Swansea as a centre, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain and Wales, and at club level for Leeds, as a .\nPlaying career.\nRugby union career.\nDavies began playing rugby union as a schoolboy playing for both Aberavon Council School and Port Talbot County School. The first notable club that Davies represented was Aberavon, and it was from Aberavon that Davies was first selected to represent the Wales national team. Davies played two international games for Wales, both as part of the 1912 Five Nations Championship. Davies' first cap was against Scotland played at St Helen's, which Wales won 21–6. Davies was selected for the next Wales match of the tournament, an away encounter to Ireland. The game started well for Wales, with Davies scoring his only international points, a try in the first half which was converted by Jack Bancroft. Despite Wales leading 5–0, the more experienced Irish team came back in the second half winning 12–5.\nBy the end of 1912, Davies had switched clubs from Aberavon to Swansea, and in October he was selected to play for county team Glamorgan when they faced the second touring South African team. Davies was not originally a first choice for the team, with Cardiff's Billy Spiller chosen not only as centre but also team captain. Three of the backs selected for the encounter, Spiller, Swansea centre Alf Thomas and fullback Jack Bancroft were all withdrawn injured after the teams met in a club clash the previous Saturday. Davies was called in to replace Spiller and was also given the captaincy. The match was a one-sided competition with the South Africans running out winners by 35 points to 3.\nDavies played in his rugby in two parts of the United Kingdom, in Wales it was for Swansea, Glamoragn and Wales, while in the South of England he played for Exeter University, Plymouth Albion, and county rugby for Devon. In 1913 he was suspended by both Wales and Devon for alleged professionalism, and in March he decided to sever links with the union game by 'Going North' and joining Leeds R.L.F.C.\nRugby league honours.\nDavies won two caps for Wales while at Leeds in 1914 and 1921, and won caps for Great Britain in 1914 against Australia, and New Zealand. Davies played right- in Leeds' 2–35 defeat by Huddersfield in the Championship Final during the 1914–15 season, and in the 11–3 victory over Dewsbury in the 1921 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1921–22 season at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Saturday 26 November 1921."

He was drafted in the first round, 21st overall, of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nEarly life.\nJohn Carroll Moore Jr. was born on November 19, 1990, in Winnetka, Illinois. His maternal grandfather James B. Longley was the governor of Maine from 1975 until 1979.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Moore played in the 2003 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Chicago Young Americans minor ice hockey team. He later played for the Winnetka Minor Mite House League before joining the Winnetka Hockey travel program.\nJunior.\nIn 2007, during his junior year at New Trier High School, Moore joined the United States Hockey League's (USHL) Chicago Steel for their 2007–08 season. In 56 games with Chicago, Moore had four goals and 15 points, then he added two assists in seven playoff games. He returned to the Steel for the 2008–09 season and saw his numbers improve greatly, as Moore had 14 goals and 39 points in 57 games. However, Chicago did not make the playoffs. He was eligible for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and was the sixth-ranked North American player as well as the top-ranked North American defenseman.\nMoore was selected by the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in the second round of the 2009 OHL Priority Draft, also being selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round, 21st overall, of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to his rookie season with the Rangers, Moore was signed to a three-year entry level contract with the Blue Jackets on July 21, 2009. In his maiden season with the Rangers in 2009–10, Moore had 10 goals and 47 points in 61 games. Moore then put up impressive numbers in the playoffs, earning 16 points in 20 games as the Rangers lost to the Windsor Spitfires in the Western Conference Finals.\nProfessional.\nColumbus Blue Jackets.\nFollowing his rookie season with the Blue Jackets, Moore was assigned to start the 2010–11 season with the Blue Jackets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. After 47 games with the Falcons, Moore was recalled by the Blue Jackets and made his NHL debut in a 4–3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on February 5, 2011. His first NHL goal was scored on October 25, 2011 against Ty Conklin of the Detroit Red Wings.\nNew York Rangers.\nDuring the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Moore was included in the NHL trade deadline day deal made by the Blue Jackets that sent Derick Brassard, Derek Dorsett, himself and a sixth-round draft pick to the New York Rangers in exchange for Marián Gáborík and prospects Blake Parlett and Steven Delisle on April 3, 2013. In his first game as a Ranger, only three hours after the trade, Moore scored his first goal of the season in a 6–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nArizona Coyotes.\nOn March 1, 2015, Moore, along with Anthony Duclair, a 2015 second-round pick and a 2016 first-round pick, were traded to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for defensemen Keith Yandle, Chris Summers and a 2015 fourth-round pick. In his short time with the club, Moore recorded 1 goal and 5 assists in 19 games.\nOn June 29, Moore was not tendered an offer as a restricted free agent by the Coyotes, making him an unrestricted free agent.\nNew Jersey Devils.\nOn July 1, 2015, Moore signed as a free agent to a three-year, $5 million contract with the New Jersey Devils. \nDuring a game against the Washington Capitals in December 2016, Moore was awkwardly hit into the boards by Capitals forward Tom Wilson and stretchered off the ice. He missed 17 games to recover from a concussion before returning to the lineup on February 12, 2017, against the San Jose Sharks. When reflecting on his recovery, Moore stated he worked with Devils skills coach Pertti Hasanen and \"really kind of challenged myself when I was injured.\"\nBoston Bruins.\nOn July 1, 2018, Moore signed as a free agent to a five-year, $13.75 million contract with the Boston Bruins. Following the signing, Moore stated \"it was a slam dunk and something I wanted to happen...[Free agency] is a bizarre thing, but when [Bruins General Manager] Don [Sweeney] called it felt right and we just wanted to make it work, and I'm really grateful that we did.\" \nPrior to rejoining the Bruins following an injury, Moore was re-assigned to the Providence Bruins on a conditioning stint on December 1, 2019.\nFollowing the Bruins elimination from the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs, Moore underwent hip arthroscopy and labral repair surgery.\nOn October 9, 2021, Moore was placed on waivers, which he cleared. However, on October 11, 2021, he was announced as part of the Bruins' opening night roster.\nAnaheim Ducks.\nOn March 19, 2022 Moore was involved in a trade that sent him to the Anaheim Ducks along with Urho Vaakanainen in exchange for Hampus Lindholm. The Ducks then attempted to trade both Moore and the remainder of Ryan Kesler's contract to the Vegas Golden Knights in exchange for Evgenii Dadonov and a conditional second-round pick at the NHL trade deadline on March 21, 2022. However, the deal went into dispute due to a no-trade clause in Dadonov's contract. On March 23, the NHL officially cancelled the trade, therefore Moore remained in the Ducks' organization.\nPersonal life.\nMoore married fellow Illinois native Elizabeth Wanders in July 2016."

A pursuit event similar to this was skied at the 2002 Winter Olympics, where the gold was shared between Thomas Alsgaard (retired by 2006) and Frode Estil, but the 2002 event 2002 event was a 20 kilometre pursuit, not 30.\nThe event opened dramatically as Estil fell at the start, causing a mass collision. Then the pack kept together almost until the end, with skiers continually trailing off as they could not keep up with the pace. Eventually, five men came into the finishing straight together, after Anders Södergren of Sweden had tried to pull away on the final lap. However, Södergren could not keep up with the pace, and Russian Yevgeny Dementyev pulled away to defeat Estil and win Russia's first gold medal of the Games.\nResults.\nThe pursuit consisted of a 15 kilometre section raced in the classical style, followed by a 15 kilometre portion raced freestyle. In between the sections, each skier took time (approximately 30 seconds) to 'pit', changing their skis. Martin Tauber, an Austrian skier, originally placed 17th, but was disqualified after the IOC declared him permanently ineligible for doping-related violations.\nThe race was started at 13:45."

La Salle won the 1954 NCAA basketball tournament.\nSeason summary.\nSome basketball historians have called La Salle star Tom Gola the Magic Johnson of his day because, at 6-7, he could play all five positions. But not even Magic piled up the kind of numbers Gola did in leading the Explorers to the 1954 national championship - 21.7 points and 23 rebounds per game. Guard Frank O’Hara was Gola’s capable running mate along with five sophomores who played complementary roles.\nSophomore Robert Ames, later a CIA official killed in the 1983 bombing of the United States embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, averaged two points and one rebound in 14 games for the Explorers."

        "text": "Robert Stephen Dunne (born 22 April 1943) is a former New Zealand cricket umpire and a former first-class cricketer. He was the first umpire to officiate in 100 One Day International matches.\nDunne was born at Dunedin in Otago in 1943. He is married with two sons. Before becoming an umpire, he played in one first-class match for New Zealand Under-23s in March 1966 and five first-class matches for Otago in the Plunket Shield in 1968/9, mainly as a left-arm medium-paced bowler. He took 10 wickets at a bowling average of 41.10. He averaged a paltry 4.28 with the bat.\nHe umpired 39 Test matches and 100 ODIs between 1989 and 2002. His first 12 Tests were in New Zealand. In 1994, he and Brian Aldridge were the two New Zealand representatives on the first international panel of umpires, set up by the ICC to ensure that one neutral umpire would stand in every Test match (later supplemented by the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires).\nIn the 2nd ODI between New Zealand and Pakistan in December 1992, at McLean Park in Napier, he made the first run out decisions in New Zealand by a television third umpire.\nHe stood with Darrell Hair in the Boxing Day Test between Australia and Sri Lanka at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1995, in which Hair no-balled Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing. Dunne was criticised for failing to back Hair by similarly calling no-ball later in the match when Muralitharan bowled from Dunne's end, but he later defended himself, saying that the decision was too difficult to make on the field, and that he backed a previous decision to refer a bowler with a suspect action to the International Cricket Council for further investigation. In 2001, he and Doug Cowie reported Shoaib Akhtar after an ODI in at Carisbrook in Dunedin.\nHe stood in four matches in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, including the semi-final between India and Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which was abandoned due to the rioting crowd after India lost their eighth wicket chasing the Sri Lankan score. The match was awarded to Sri Lanka. He also umpired in five matches in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. In 1999/2000, he stood in Pakistan's first Test match in India for 12 years, and the first Test between the sides for nine years, at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.\nHis 100th ODI was the match between New Zealand and England at his home ground in Dunedin on 26 February 2002. He had also stood in his first ODI at Carisbrook, just over 13 years earlier.\nHe retired after he was not chosen as one of the eight umpires on the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, as he was considered not good enough for the modern game. He published an autobiographical account of his experiences, \"Alone in the Middle\", in 2003."

He was the first coach in UNF baseball history, having founded the program in the 1980s and serving as head coach from 1988–2010. UNF's baseball field, officially Dusty Rhodes Field at Harmon Stadium, is named in his honor.\nLife.\nDusty Rhodes started his coaching career in the minor leagues, working in the New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers organizations. He then shifted to college baseball, coaching at Palm Beach Junior College. He was hired by UNF in 1986 to start up the school's first baseball program.\nAs the coach at UNF, he saw the program through its days in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), NCAA Division II, and finally NCAA Division I. While in the NAIA he led UNF to three Number 1 rankings in NAIA and the Number 1 ranking in NCAA Division II in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. He coached the Ospreys to two NAIA World Series, and three Division II World Series, with a second place finish in the team's final year of Division II competition. In 2005, UNF's first season of Division I play, he led the Ospreys to a 34-21 record. In 2008, the Ospreys defeated four in-state opponents (the Florida Gators, Florida State Seminoles, Miami Hurricanes, and South Florida Bulls).\nIn 2004, Rhodes was the coach of the Greek national baseball team for the 2004 Athens Olympics. The team finished in 7th, with one win over Italy. He has also worked with the USA national team as an assistant. He also operated a baseball camp each year that takes place at Harmon Stadium.\nRhodes announced his retirement after the 2010 season. That summer he married his longtime girlfriend, a UNF employee. He was succeeded as head baseball coach by Smoke Laval. In 2010 UNF named its baseball field Dusty Rhodes Field at Harmon Stadium after Rhodes.\nAfter retiring from college coaching, Rhodes served as the hitting coach for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, Midwest League single-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers from 2011 to 2013."

In 1895 Jackson was selected for the Wales national team for the opening match of the 1895 Home Nations Championship. The game was played at home, at Swansea's St. Helen's to England. Jackson was one of five new caps brought into the Wales team, though he and Cardiff's William Elsey were the only new players in the pack. The Welsh forwards were outplayed by a livelier English pack in a game which saw Wales lose 6-14. Jackson was replaced for the next game by Harry Packer and never represented Wales again.\nIn 1899, Jackson was one of the Swansea team, who were invited to play against a French team in Paris. Although the French international team was not officially formed until 1906, there was a French Rugby Championship, and an 'All France' team was assembled to face Swansea. The two teams met on 16 April 1899 which Swansea won 30-3 with Jackson believed to have scored the first try.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

It was originally scheduled for 15 February, but high winds meant that only part of the ski jumping competition was completed on that day, with the conclusion, and the cross-country race, taking place on 16 February.\nResults.\nSki Jumping.\nEach of the four team members, performed two jumps, which were judged in the same fashion as the Olympic ski jumping competition. The scores for all the jumps each team took were summed, and used to calculate their deficit in the cross-country race. Each one point behind the leading score of Germany was equivalent to one second of time deficit. Heavy winds delayed the competition after the first round of jumps; these jumps eventually counted, and the competition was resumed the following day. The world championship team from Norway had to pull out of the competition, as four of its athletes became sick. Had the competition been restarted, they would have been able to compete with a different group of athletes, but keeping the scores from the first day meant that Norway was out. Italy also had to pull out, when Davide Bresadola was forced to go to hospital on account of illness.\nCross-Country.\nThe start for the 4 x 5 kilometre relay race was staggered, with a one-point deficit in the ski jump portion resulting in a one second deficit in starting the cross-country course. This stagger meant that the first team across the finish line, Austria was the overall winner of the event. The German team, which started first, led after the third relay leg, but Austria's Mario Stecher gained 36 seconds on Germany's Jens Gaiser on the final leg, taking the Austrian team to the gold medal."

        "title": "1996 Cricket World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1996 ICC Cricket World Cup Final was a cricket match played to determine the winner of the sixth installment of the ICC Cricket World Cup. The match was played on 17 March 1996 at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan. In 1996 the stadium had a capacity of about 60,000 spectators and was hosting a final for the first time. The match was contested between former World Cup winners Australia, who were considered the favourites and Sri Lanka. It was Australia's third World Cup final appearance after their win in the 1987 edition and the loss to West Indies in the 1975 ICC Cricket World Cup final. It was Sri Lanka's first final appearance.\nAfter Australia scored 241 runs for the loss of 7 wickets in their allotted 50 overs, Sri Lanka won the match by scoring 245 runs for the loss of only 3 wickets with 22 balls remaining. Consequently, Sri Lanka emerged as the champions of the 1996 world cup.\nGame summary.\nSri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga won the toss and sent Australia out to bat. Ranatunga later reminisced that he had visited the stadium the previous night with the manager and observed the \"weight of dew\" on the ground which led them to the conclusion that it would be advantageous to bat second.\nAfter a blazing start from captain Mark Taylor and young superstar and future captain Ricky Ponting, Australia fell from being 1–137 to 5–170 after Sri Lanka's four-pronged spin attack took its toll. Australia eventually reached 7–241 in its quota of 50 overs. Sri Lanka overcame a nervous start where they lost both openers before the score was 30, to win in 45 overs. Sri Lankan batting sensation Aravinda De Silva played a match-winning knock of 107 not out and was assisted ably by fellow veterans Asanka Gurusingha (65) and captain Ranatunga (47 not out). De Silva was named the man of the match for his all-round performance. Apart from his century while batting, he bowled 10 overs taking 3 wickets for 42 runs during the Australian innings. Sanath Jayasuriya was awarded the man of the series award.\nBackground.\nAustralia and Sri Lanka had never previously faced each other in a major tournament final. Australia were former winners of the World Cup in 1987 whilst Sri Lanka had never gotten past the group stages of the competition.\nThe two teams however, had a fierce rivalry stemming from Sri Lanka's tour to Australia in the summer of 1995/1996. Their up-and-coming spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan was the subject of much scrutiny during the tour as he was called for 'chucking' during the Boxing Day Test of 1995 by field umpire Darrell Hair. The treatment of Muralitharan was compared to a \"public execution\" by the commentator, Jim Maxwell. After the test series resulting in a resounding 3–0 win to Australia, the triangular one-day series, known as the 'Benson and Hedges World Series' was a much closer contest. Along with other participants the West Indies, Sri Lanka proved a challenge for the all conquering Australian team, who were not able to win easily like their past fixtures. Sri Lanka brushed the West Indies aside to reach the \nfinal of the tournament against Australia, sporting a full head of steam after defeating Australia in their previous match at the MCG. However, Australia ran out 2–0 winners and the tension between the teams was evident through the post-tournament celebrations. Mark Taylor, Australia's captain had offered to shake the hand of Ranatunga, who declined. Many thought that this was due to the Muralitharan affair. Many Sri Lankans cited the incident as an act of racism and discrimination towards the Sri Lankans and to Muralitharan himself. This was augmented by the chants from the fanatic Australian fans yelling \"No Ball!!\" every time Muralitharan bowled a ball.\nDuring the world cup, Australia and the West Indies refused to travel to Sri Lanka due to security concerns in the wake of a suicide bombing in Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lanka were awarded points from their match with Australia by default, this incident contributed to increasing tensions ahead of the final.\nRoad to Lahore.\nSri Lanka\nSri Lanka had finished top of Group A ahead of Australia in who were in the same group.\nTheir first match of the tournament was scheduled to be against Australia themselves at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. However, Australia citing safety concerns refused to play the game and forfeited, giving Sri Lanka a handy 2 points. Their next match against Zimbabwe also in Colombo proved to be an easy win for the Lankans with De Silva pounding 91 off 86 balls to lead the chase of 228 in 37 overs. The West Indies then also followed suit handing Sri Lanka a further 2 points for the same reason as the Australians. Sri Lanka then head to Delhi, India to take on an in-form India. Tendulkar blitzed a century before Sanath Jayasuriya provided some fireworks of his own smashing 79 off 76 balls and leading Sri Lanka to a comfortable 6 wicket win chasing 272 for victory. Sri Lanka's final group match was against the lowly Kenya who had upset the West Indies earlier in the tournament. However, Sri Lanka were far from complacent as a ruthless batting display lead them to the highest One Day International Team Score ever scoring 5–398 in their 50 overs. De Silva once again the star this time scoring 145.\nSri Lanka then faced England in the quarter-finals of the competition. But the Englishmen proved to be no contest for the Sri Lankan's as new star Sanath Jayasuriya revelled in his opening role scoring a merciless 82 off 44 balls leading Sri Lanka to reach the score of 237 in 40 overs.\nThe semi-finals saw Sri Lanka pitted against India yet again at the 120,000 seater stadium of Eden Gardens in Kolkata, India. India were hot favourites to win, despite Sri Lanka's hot form coming into the game. India's home advantage was expected to see them through to the final. Captain Mohammad Azharuddin won the toss and knowing Sri Lanka's ability to chase down totals whilst batting second, put them in to bat first, even though the pitch was predicted to play up under the floodlights. Sri Lanka's hopes seemed to be dashed as they lost both Jayasuriya and the equally destructive Romesh Kaluwitharana in the first over of the innings leaving Sri Lanka at 2–0. However, De Silva made a counterattacking 66 off just 47 balls shifting the momentum back to the Lankans. Sri Lanka eventually reached 8–251 from their 50 overs thanks to their long batting order. However, it again looked bleak for Sri Lanka as Sachin Tendulkar, India's own batting sensation lead India to 1–98 in around 20 overs. But his dismissal triggered an amazing collapse which left the favourites at 8–120. The Kolkata crowd began to throw bottles and other projectiles at the Sri Lankans who were awarded the match by default. On the day, 110,000 plus people attended the event at Eden Gardens\nAustralia\nAustralia, forfeited their match to Sri Lanka. However, they started their campaign well easily defeating Kenya by 97 runs. A few days later, they defeated India by 16 runs in a close match. They then defeated Zimbabwe by 8 wickets. This allowed them to qualify for the quarter-finals despite a four-wicket loss to the West Indies.\nIn the fourth quarterfinal, Australia defeated New Zealand by six wickets to qualify for the semi-finals. The semi final with West Indies was a very close match. West Indies were cruising to victory and needed only 43 runs from 52 balls with eight wickets in hand before suffering a dramatic collapse. In the last over, West Indies needed six runs to win, with the West Indian captain Richie Richardson remaining unbeaten. However, Courtney Walsh, who was on strike, lost his wicket to Glenn McGrath leading Australia to a very unlikely victory.\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1-36 (Mark Waugh), 2-137 (Mark Taylor), 3-152 (Ricky Ponting), 4-156 (Shane Warne), 5-170 (Steve Waugh), 6-202 (Stuart Law), 7-205 (Ian Healy)\nFall of wickets: 1-12 (Sanath Jayasuriya), 2-23 (Romesh Kaluwitharana), 3-148 (Asanka Gurusinha)"

Not long after his inclusion into the Swansea team, Howell was called up by the Welsh selectors to represent Wales as part of the 1888 Home Nations Championship. Howell was one of five new caps brought into the nine man pack for the first game against Scotland, along with Dick Kedzlie, Richard Powell and Swansea team-mates T. Williams and John Meredith. The game finished in an historic victory for Wales, when they beat the Scottish for the first time, winning by a solitary try.\nHowell was reselected for the second and last match of the Championship when he was called up to face Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 3 March 1888. Howell was part of an unchanged pack, the first time this had ever happened for the Wales team, but the team that had been so successful in disrupting the Scottish play, could not recreate their level of play in Ireland. The Irish beat the Welsh for the first time, which ended the Championship careers of eight of the Wales team. Howell was never selected for the national team again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

His 300th and last match was the 2–15 defeat by Workington Town at Borough Park, Workington on Saturday 20 September 1952.\nIn the early part of his career Ryan played mostly at centre but from 1945 onwards played primarily at fullback.\nRyan appeared in five consecutive Lancashire Cup finals between 1946 and 1950, appearing on the winning side in four. The only defeat was the first, a 3–7 defeat by Widnes in the 1945–46 Final at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 27 October 1945. The next four were victories; 9–3 over Belle Vue Rangers in the 1946–47 final at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 26 October 1946, a 10–7 victory over Belle Vue Rangers in the 1947–48 Final at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 1 November 1947, a 14–8 victory over Warrington in the 1948–49 Final at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 13 November 1948, and a 20–7 victory over Leigh in the 1949–50 Final during the 1949–50 season at Wilderspool on Saturday 29 October 1949.\nChampionship success came in the 1943–44 season where Ryan, playing out of position at played in both legs of the final against Dewsbury.

He signed for Leigh the same month, Wigan receiving half the desired fee - £250. Ryan made his one and only appearance for Leigh in February 1955 in a Challenge Cup match against Doncaster before the recurrence of the shoulder injury forced a permanent retirement. Ryan returned to Wigan as a director of the club in later years. Outside of rugby league Ryan worked in the brewing industry for the Burtonwood Brewery.\nInternational honours.\nRyan was first capped for in 1943 against and went on to appear for England a further 10 times; in 1945 against Wales, in 1946 against (2 matches), and Wales, in 1947 against Wales (2 matches), in 1948 against France (2 matches), in 1949 against France (2 matches), in 1950 against Wales.\nRyan was selected to tour Australia and New Zealand as part of the 1946 Great Britain Lions tour squad but only played in four non-test games before a hernia and subsequent surgery ruled him out of the rest of the tour. His first cap came against in 1947 as was followed by two caps against in 1948 and a final cap against Australia in 1950.\nRelatives.\nRyan's younger brother Andrew played for Warrington during the 1949–50 season."

The team is coached by Shea Ralph, entering her third season.\nMemorial Gymnasium.\nThe Commodores play their home games in Memorial Gymnasium. Memorial Gymnasium was built in the early 1950s. It was dedicated as the campus memorial to students and alumni killed in World War II; a plaque commemorating those who died is displayed in the Gym's North lobby.\nAt the time of the Gym's construction, there was a serious discussion within the Vanderbilt community about whether the school should de-emphasize intercollegiate athletics and refocus on its academic program. As a compromise between those who advocated increased athletics competition and those who argued in favor of de-emphasis, the Gymnasium was built to hold only about 9,000 seats, and it would be readily adaptable to other uses—significantly, as a possible concert hall.\nConsequently, the gymnasium floor was built up above its surroundings, more in the nature of a stage. The areas out of bounds along the sidelines were very wide, in contrast with the small facility which it replaced, where the walls were right along the sidelines and players could scrape their shoulders bringing the ball up the court. This necessitated the placement of the benches at the end of the court, which was not highly unusual at the time.\nMemorial Gym is well known for its unusual design. The end-of-the-floor bench location is now unique in major college basketball, and SEC coaches who travel to Memorial, along with coaches from other schools who have played at Vanderbilt as a post-season venue, have said that the unusual setup gives Vanderbilt a tremendous home court advantage, since no other facility in which opponents play is arranged in such a way.\nYear by year results.\nConference tournament winners noted with # Source\nPostseason results.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Commodores made one appearance in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 0–1."

        "text": "The 2010 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2009–10 season, and the culmination of the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Western Conference champion Chicago Blackhawks and the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia Flyers. It was Chicago's eleventh appearance in the Finals and their first since , a loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was Philadelphia's eighth appearance in the Finals and their first since , a loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Chicago defeated Philadelphia four games to two to win their fourth Stanley Cup in franchise history, and their first since , ending the longest active Stanley Cup drought.\nThe Blackhawks became the fourth major Chicago sports team to win a championship since 1986, joining the 1985 Chicago Bears, the Chicago Bulls dynasty of the 1990s, and the 2005 Chicago White Sox. The 2016 Chicago Cubs would complete the cycle of all Chicago sports teams winning at least one championship in 30 years. Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the 2010 playoffs, and was the first Blackhawks player to receive this honor. He and teammates Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook won the Olympic gold medal with Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics, adding the three players to the list of Ken Morrow () and Steve Yzerman and Brendan Shanahan (both ), as well as Drew Doughty and Jeff Carter (both ), as the only players to accomplish this double in the same year. Having played for Team USA at the Olympics, Patrick Kane joined Chris Chelios and Brett Hull (both 2002) as having won both the Olympic silver medal and Stanley Cup in the same year. Jonathan Toews also became the 24th player and the seventh Canadian to become a member of the Triple Gold Club having won an Olympic gold medal, an IIHF World Championship Gold Medal, and the Stanley Cup.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThis was the third straight Finals in which the Western Conference team was an Original Six team that won the Central Division and the Eastern Conference team was an Atlantic Division team from the state of Pennsylvania. The Red Wings and Penguins played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals in and .\nThe Blackhawks and Flyers had previously met in the 1971 playoffs; the Blackhawks defeated the Flyers in four games.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks finished the regular season as the Central Division champions with 112 points. This is the 14th division title in franchise history for Chicago, but the first since when it was called the Norris Division. As the second seed in the Western Conference playoffs, the Blackhawks defeated the seventh seed Nashville Predators and the third seed Vancouver Canucks in six games each, and then swept the first seed San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Final to advance to the Finals for the first time since .\nChicago's Marian Hossa is the first player in NHL history to appear in three straight Stanley Cup Finals with three different teams. He previously made the Final with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2008 and with the Detroit Red Wings in 2009. Along with Hossa, the other half of Chicago's preseason acquisition from Detroit, Tomas Kopecky, was also playing in his third straight Stanley Cup Finals.\nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nThe Philadelphia Flyers earned the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs after finishing the regular season with 88 points, and winning the tiebreaker over the Montreal Canadiens, with more wins (41 to 39). The Flyers were the last team to qualify for the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs. Their Cinderella march to the Finals began on the final day of the regular season when they met the New York Rangers in a winner-take-all match-up for the final playoff spot. Philadelphia defeated their Atlantic Division rivals 2–1 in a shootout, the first do-or-die shootout for a playoff spot in NHL history.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Flyers upset the second seed divisional rival New Jersey Devils in five games. In the second round, against the sixth-seeded Boston Bruins, Philadelphia became the third NHL team to win a seven-game series after being down three games to none (the others being the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders). In addition, in game seven of that series, the Flyers overcame a three goals to none deficit to win the game and series, 4–3.\nIn the Eastern Conference Final, the Flyers eliminated the Canadiens in five games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since . They were also the first team to reach the Finals with less than 90 points in the regular season since the Vancouver Canucks in , when they had 85. It also gave the city of Philadelphia the distinction of being the first city to have all its teams play in each of the four professional sports leagues title rounds since 2000, following the 76ers in the 2001 NBA Finals, the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX after the season, and the Phillies in back-to-back World Series in and , winning in 2008 to bring the city of Philadelphia a championship after 25 years. The Flyers attempted to win the Stanley Cup for the first time since winning back-to-back Stanley Cups in and .\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks won the first game by a score of 6–5 on the strength of two goals by Troy Brouwer. Throughout the game, the two teams traded goals with neither team having a lead greater than one. The Flyers opened the scoring at 6:38 of the first period on a goal by Ville Leino that deflected off the face of Niklas Hjalmarsson. The Blackhawks responded with two quick goals, one of which was shorthanded, to take the lead. The lead would not last long, however, as the Flyers would counter with two goals of their own to re-take the lead 3–2 after the first period. Patrick Sharp scored 1:11 into the second period to tie the game once again. Both teams would trade goals once again and tie the game at five after the second period. Michael Leighton was replaced by Brian Boucher after allowing the fifth Chicago goal. In the third period, Tomas Kopecky scored what would eventually prove to be the game winner at 8:25. Antti Niemi finished the game with 27 saves on 32 shots while Leighton saved 15 out of 20 shots. Boucher stopped 11 of 12 shots faced in relief of Leighton.\nGame two.\nThe Blackhawks took game two of the best-of-seven series by a score of 2–1, thus giving them a 2–0 series lead heading into games three and four in Philadelphia. In contrast to game one, game two was a low-scoring affair with much tighter defense displayed by both teams. Neither team would score in the opening frame as the game entered the first intermission scoreless. It was not until late in the second period that Chicago managed to get the ice breaker with a goal from Marian Hossa. The Blackhawks quickly added another goal just 28 seconds later on a wrist shot by Ben Eager. The Flyers would eventually reply in the third period on a power play goal by Simon Gagne but it would not be enough. Both goaltenders were much stronger as Antti Niemi stopped 32 of 33 shots for the Blackhawks while Michael Leighton rebounded with 24 stops on 26 shots. \nGame three.\nThe Flyers won game three in overtime, 4–3, to pull within two games to one in the series. Daniel Briere opened the scoring for Philadelphia with a power play goal at 14:58 of the first period. Duncan Keith tied the game at 1–1 early in the second period, and both teams added another goal to leave the score at 2–2 entering the third period. Patrick Kane scored with 17:10 remaining in the game to give the Blackhawks their first lead, but Ville Leino responded with the tying goal 20 seconds later. In overtime, shortly after a review determined that a shot by Gagne was not a goal, Claude Giroux scored the game-winner at 5:59 of the extra period. This was the first time since 1987 that the Flyers had won a game in the Stanley Cup Finals. \nGame four.\nThe Flyers evened the series at two games apiece by winning game four, 5–3. The Flyers took the lead 4:35 into the game on a Mike Richards power play goal. Matt Carle extended their lead to 2–0 at 14:48 of the first period. Sharp cut Philadelphia's lead in half with 1:28 left in the period, but Giroux restored the Flyers' two-goal advantage 51 seconds later. Following a scoreless second period, Leino gave Philadelphia a three-goal lead 6:43 into the third period. Dave Bolland (on a power play) and Brian Campbell scored later in the third to leave Chicago trailing 4–3 with 4:10 remaining. However, Jeff Carter scored an empty-net goal with 25 seconds left to clinch the Flyers' victory.\nGame five.\nThe Blackhawks took a 3–2 lead in the series with a 7–4 victory in game five. At 12:17 of the first period, Brent Seabrook scored on a power play to give Chicago the lead. Within the next six minutes, the Blackhawks tripled their advantage, adding goals by Bolland and Kris Versteeg to make the score 3–0. At the start of the second period, the Flyers again took Leighton out of the game, replacing him with Boucher. Four goals were scored in the second period—two by each team—and the Blackhawks entered the third period with a 5–2 lead. James van Riemsdyk pulled Philadelphia within two goals at 6:36 of the third. Sharp made the score 6–3 with 3:52 remaining, but Gagne answered for the Flyers 1:16 later. Thirty-one seconds after Gagne's goal, Dustin Byfuglien tallied an empty-net goal—his second goal of the game—which concluded the scoring. Flyers' alternate captain Chris Pronger was on the ice for six of Chicago's goals and was in the penalty box on the seventh. Discounting the power play goal, Pronger finished -5 on the game.\nGame six.\nThe sixth game required overtime, as the score was tied 3–3 at the end of the third period. Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks scored the Cup-winning goal at 4:06 into the overtime period, a shot in which the puck crossed the goal line and then got stuck underneath the padding in the back of the net. Several observers, including most of the players, announcers, and all the officials initially lost sight of the puck. Only Kane and Patrick Sharp started to celebrate immediately, soon followed by the rest of the Blackhawks. It was only after a video review that the goal was officially awarded.\nJonathan Toews won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. It was the first Cup to be won in overtime since .\nTelevision.\nIn Canada, the series was televised in English on CBC and in French on the cable network RDS. In the United States, NBC broadcast games one, two, five, and six, while Versus televised games three and four. In Europe, Viasat Sport broadcast the televised finals in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia), through five regional divisions of Viasat Sport. Its sister channel Viasat Sport East broadcast in the Russian language to the European and Eurasian countries of Russia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.\nRatings.\nGame one produced the best overnight rating in the United States for a game one since the 1999 Final. The 2.8 overnight rating and six share was a 12-percent increase from the first game of the 2009 Final between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Detroit Red Wings. Meanwhile, in Canada, game one was viewed by people on CBC.\nGame two of the series, on Memorial Day, earned a 4.1 rating. The number of viewers increased as the game averaged approximately viewers with a peak of at ET. According to NBC, this is the highest game two since at least the 1975 Final because data prior to then is unavailable. Game two also saw a 21-percent increase over 2009's second game. In local markets game two drew a 25.1 rating and 39 share in Chicago along with an 18.5 rating and 28 share in Philadelphia.\nGame three returned to cable on Versus where it received a 2.0 rating and viewers. The broadcast peaked at viewers at ET. It ranked as the highest rated and most viewed program in the history of Versus. It also ranked as the highest-rated and most-viewed Stanley Cup Finals game on cable television since .\nGame four saw a decline of 9% from the 2009 Final between the Penguins and the Red Wings as just viewers tuned into the game.\nWith the series returning to broadcast television on NBC, the ratings trend rebounded and improved over the 2009 Final ratings trend. Game five's prime time portion of the broadcast received a 3.3 final rating and averaged viewers, an increase of 38% in the ratings and 32% in viewers over the 2009 Final. Locally, the Chicago market received a 26.0 rating while Philadelphia had a 19.7 rating. The average for the three NBC broadcasts rose to viewers, an increase of 800,000 compared to 2009. This increase came despite going head to head with the 2010 NBA Finals.\nGame six was the most-watched NHL game since game six in 1974, drawing a 4.7 rating and 8 share, up 38 percent vs. 3.4/6 for game six in 2009. The top two markets were Chicago, with a 32.8/50 and Philadelphia, 26.8/38. In Canada, game six was the most-watched all-American Stanley Cup Finals game on the CBC, with 4.077 million viewers. The Final averaged 3.107 million viewers, up 44 percent from 2009.\nImpact and aftermath.\nBlackhawks.\nThe win was the Blackhawks' first championship since . It gave the city of Chicago the distinction of being the first city to have at least a championship in each of the four major professional sports since 1985. It also vaulted Toews into the Triple Gold Club, winning the Olympic gold medal in Vancouver earlier in 2010 and an IIHF World Championship Gold medal in 2007. Toews and defencemen Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook also became the fourth, fifth, and sixth players to win Olympic Gold and the Stanley Cup in the same year. With Chicago's win, the Toronto Maple Leafs are now the only Original Six team not to win the Stanley Cup or play in the Finals since the 1967 expansion; their most recent Finals appearance is 1967.\nThe day after the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley issued a proclamation declaring June 11 Chicago Blackhawks Day in the city of Chicago. That day, an estimated two million Chicagoans attended the Blackhawks Stanley Cup parade, more than the estimated 1.75 million who attended the parade for the Chicago White Sox's 2005 World Series championship, and more than the rallies at Grant Park for any of the Chicago Bulls' NBA championships. The Blackhawks' celebration also overshadowed the series between the White Sox and Chicago Cubs taking place around the same time. However, White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén said that the parade the White Sox had was far bigger than the Blackhawks'. Daley presented the proclamation to the team at the celebratory parade and rally.\nUS President Barack Obama, a former US Senator from Illinois and Chicago resident, phoned Joel Quennville to congratulate his team and to invite them to the White House. Obama joked that he now had \"bragging rights\" over Vice President Joe Biden, a Flyers fan.\nFlyers.\nThe loss by the Flyers was the sixth straight Finals series they lost, tying them with the 1933–40 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1956–95 Detroit Red Wings for most consecutive Finals lost.\nThe missing Cup-winning puck.\nSince the Cup-winning puck got stuck underneath the padding in the back of the net to end game six, there was controversy and speculation as to its whereabouts. Amid the confusion involving the video review and the subsequent celebrations, the Cup-winning puck got lost. Because it ended the Blackhawks' then-record for the longest active Cup drought, it was considered a valuable piece of sport memorabilia. So much so, a Chicago-based restaurant offered a $50,000 reward for it, and the FBI was called in to investigate the case.\nVideo and pictures taken from the game indicated that linesman Steve Miller was the first person who took the puck after the game-winning goal was scored, but he denied knowing where it eventually went. As a result of an ESPN story about the controversy on April 21, 2011, the league relieved Miller of his 2011 postseason duties for more than a week, citing that the controversy was a potential distraction during the playoffs. In reinstating Miller, the league said it stood by him and his story.\nControversy.\nControversy came throughout the first four games between the Blackhawks and Flyer defenceman Chris Pronger. Chicago complained that Pronger had gotten away with rough play that they felt was beyond the rules. The Blackhawks argued that even when they responded with the same actions that Pronger was being allowed to get away with, that they would instead be given a penalty. The Blackhawks set up a meeting with the NHL to make a complaint about Pronger's play.\nPronger had been noticed by the media and the NHL at the end of games one and two of the series as he picked up and left with the game puck at the conclusion of the games. When asked, Pronger replied that he had thrown the pucks in the garbage.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2010 Stanley Cup was presented to Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Blackhawks' 4–3 overtime win over the Flyers in game six.\nThe following Blackhawks players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2009–10 Chicago Blackhawks"

The final ranking event of the 2009-10 snooker season, it was the 34th year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible, first held in 1927. The event was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and had a total prize fund of £1,111,000, with £250,000 going to the winner of the event. The tournament was sponsored by sports betting company Betfred.\nJohn Higgins was the defending champion, but lost in the second round 11–13 to Steve Davis. Neil Robertson won the event after a 18–13 win over Graeme Dott in the final. In winning the event, Robertson was the second player from outside of the British Isles to win the event in the modern era of snooker, and the first Australian to win the event since the disputed 1952 World Snooker Championship which contained only Australian and New Zealand players. There were 60 century breaks made during the event, the highest being a 146 made by both Dott and Mark Allen.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Invented in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in Great Britain. In modern times it has been played worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nIn the 2010 tournament, 32 professional players competed in one-on-one snooker matches played over several , using a single-elimination tournament format. The 32 players were selected for the event using the snooker world rankings and a pre-tournament qualification competition. In 1927, the first world championship was won by Joe Davis. The event's final took place in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The event was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Scotsman John Higgins was the defending champion, having defeated Shaun Murphy 18–9 in the previous year's final. The event was sponsored by sports betting company Betfred, who extended their sponsorship of the event for a further four years.\nFormat.\nThe 2010 World Snooker Championship took place from 17 April to 3 May 2010 in Sheffield, England.

This was the 34th consecutive year that the tournament had been staged at the Crucible. The main stages of the event were broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players.

Noticing that ticket purchases for the boats were often confusing to prospective passengers, Jacobs began scalping boat tickets. He then bought concession rights on all the boats docked at the Battery, sold train tickets to recent immigrants, and eventually ran his own ferryboats.\nJacobs then became a ticket scalper in New York, buying and selling theater, opera, or sports events tickets. He began promoting events himself, including charity balls, bike races, and circuses.\nJacobs met famous boxing promoter Tex Rickard in 1906 at the Joe Gans-Battling Nelson bout in Goldfield, Nevada, and eventually became Rickard's \"money man\" by the time of the 1919 Jack Dempsey-Jess Willard bout.\nAfter Rickard's death in 1929, Jacobs then became a promoter of events at the Hippodrome in New York City's Sixth Avenue, and afterward, a promoter for Madison Square Garden – then the dominant New York City-area boxing promotion franchise – staging 320 shows there from 1937 to 1949.\nBoxing promoter.\nIn 1933, sportswriters Damon Runyon, Ed Frayne, and Bill Farnsworth of the Hearst newspaper chain arranged for Jacobs to stage Hearst's annual Milk Fund boxing benefit at the Bronx Coliseum; Jacobs promised the charity a substantially better cut of the proceeds than the event's prior promoter, Madison Square Garden. With this experience, Jacobs and the three sportswriters founded the Twentieth Century Sporting Club, a rival boxing promotion franchise to that of Madison Square Garden, later in 1933. Jacobs, as President of Twentieth Century Sports Club, at first used the Hippodrome in New York as his primary venue. The club’s initial bout was staged in January 1934 between Barney Ross and Billy Petrolle.\nJacobs' boxing promotion career changed forever in 1935, when he met with the management team of then up-and-coming African American heavyweight contender Joe Louis. Although Louis had black management at the time from his hometown of Detroit, Michigan, Jacobs promised the prospect of delivering a title shot to Louis, at a time when informal barriers still kept negro boxers from obtaining a world championship. Meeting at the Frog Club, a colored nightclub, Jacobs and the Louis team and hammered out a three-year exclusive boxing promotion deal.\nLouis's first bout in Yankee Stadium grossed $328,655, while his fight with Max Baer grossed over $1 million. After Louis' unexpected loss to Max Schmeling in 1936, Jacobs convinced Joe Gould, manager for heavyweight titleholder James Braddock – contractually obligated to defend his title against Madison Square Garden's preferred opponent Schmeling – to instead defend his crown against young Louis. While a boon for Louis, Gould's price was onerous; Jacobs would have to pay 10% of all future boxing promotion profits (including any future profits from Louis' future bouts) for ten years. Louis defeated Braddock and remained World Heavyweight Champion for an even longer period of time, until 1949. Every fight Louis fought as a champion was promoted by Jacobs.\nLeveraging his success with Louis, Jacobs' organization began to assert its control over other divisions. In August 1937, MSG leased Madison Square Garden's main facility as well as the outdoor Madison Square Garden Bowl to the Twentieth Century Sporting Club. In reality, this arrangement put MSG out of the big-time boxing promotion business, which Jacobs dominated from that time on. In 1938, Jacobs became the sole shareholder of the Twentieth Century Sporting Club, paying off Runyon and forcing the other two partners out.\nEventually Jacobs would come to control the championships of every weight division in boxing. In 1937, he originated the first paid radio sponsorship for a series of boxing matches, over 18 weeks, from the New York Hippodrome, heard on WHN, New York. Sam Taub was the blow-by-blow reporter. In September 1944, Jacobs secured the first commercial sponsorship of a television boxing match—the Featherweight title bout between Willie Pep and Chalky Wright. During World War II, he promoted a boxing extravaganza that realized $36 million in U.S. War Bond sales. Three times during his career Jacobs promoted million-dollar fights. His biggest championship fight gate was the Louis–Billy Conn rematch in 1946 that grossed $1,925,564.\nLater career and death.\nJacobs suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in 1946 but remained the head of the organization, with his relative Sol Strauss operating the club on a day-to-day basis. When Louis decided to retire and then go into business with the group that became the International Boxing Club, the Twentieth Century Sporting Club ceased to function; Jacobs sold it to Madison Square Garden in 1949. Jacobs remained in ill health and died in January 1953. He was buried in Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. He was posthumously elected to the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1982, and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990."

        "text": "The Oklahoma Sooners women's basketball team represents the University of Oklahoma (OU) and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I.\nHistory.\nOU women's basketball began during the 1974–75 academic year. In March 1990, Oklahoma officials released a statement saying that the women's basketball program was to be dropped, after many years of sub-par performance and low attendance. Many people voiced their complaints and eight days later, OU reinstated the program. At the time, the average attendance per game was 65 people. In 1996, Oklahoma hired former Norman High School women's basketball coach Sherri Coale to the same position at the university. The Sooner women's basketball team developed in years since to status as a leader in attendance across the nation. The Sooners averaged attendance of 6,851 in 2011–12 at home games, and the support for the sport led to Oklahoma hosting first and second-round games in the Women's NCAA Basketball Championships at Lloyd Noble Center in Norman. The Sooners also set a record on February 2, 2009, when they played host to the number 13 Tennessee Lady Volunteers, led by coach Pat Summit, who was trying to get career victory 1,000, something that no other coach had done before. The attendance for that game, which was held at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, was close to 13,000 as well as setting a record for the most watched women's basketball game in history. The Sooners led the Big 12 conference in attendance as well. As with the men's team, they call Lloyd Noble Center home.\nThe program gained national prominence during the 2002 post-season when they advanced to the national title game and lost to the University of Connecticut Huskies. In the 2005–06 season, the Sooners were led by their coach Sherri Coale and the nationally known sophomore twins Courtney and Ashley Paris, daughters of former San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle Bubba Paris, to the third round of the national tournament. The team also won the Big 12 regular-season championship (with a 16–0 conference record) and the Big 12 Tournament. They became the first Big 12 women's basketball team to remain undefeated throughout conference play.\nIn the 2008–09 season, the Sooners made it to the Final Four of the 2009 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. They advanced through the Oklahoma City Regional, where they enjoyed considerable home court advantage, as Norman and Oklahoma City are separated by fewer than 20 miles.\nThe 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons failed to result in regional championships and NCAA Final Four appearances. Playing through rigorous non-conference schedules and a rugged Big 12 slate, the Sooners received No. 6 seeds each of the two years. The 10–11 team advanced through the Charlottesville, Virginia, first and second round site with a win over nearby James Madison University and an upset win over the University of Miami Hurricanes. The season came to an abrupt halt in Dayton, Ohio, in the Sweet Sixteen, with the team falling to No. 2 seed Notre Dame, which steamrolled to a national championship appearance that year. The 11–12 team failed to make it past the No. 3 seed St. John's Red Storm in a 74–70 defeat in front of several thousand Sooner fans in Norman, Oklahoma. St. Johns lost in the Sweet Sixteen to the Duke Blue Devils in Fresno, California.\nOklahoma City hosted an NCAA regional in March 2013.\nThe 2012–13 Sooners missed graduating senior Jelena Serena, but retained the rest of the team. Adding to the corps were two National Top 20 recruits, Maddie Manning and Nicole Kornet, and Sooners Jasmine Hartman and Lyndsey Cloman rejoined the active roster. Both Hartman and Cloman sat out the entire 2011–12 season with injuries.\nConference affiliations.\nOklahoma has played in the Big 8 and the Big 12 conferences. The Sooners joined the Big 12 in 1996 when the Big 8 and four members of the Southwest Conference created the Big 12.\nOklahoma has been affiliated with the following conferences:\nCoaches.\nSince its formation in 1974 the team has been led by eight different head coaches with the most recent being Sherri Coale who retired after the 2020–21 season.\nChampionships.\nConference regular season.\n§ – Conference co-champions\nNCAA tournament history.\nThe Sooners reached the NCAA tournament and Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 1986. In 1995, Oklahoma made their second trip to the tourney, falling in the second round.\nAfter another break, the Sooners made their third appearance in the 1999–2000 season, and have become a mainstay in the tournament since then, entering the field of 64 every year since. In that time period, the Sooners have reached three Final Four appearances, which is tied for 9th in NCAA Women's Basketball History. Since 2002, the Sooners' first appearance, their three appearances ties them for fifth, behind Tennessee (6), Connecticut (5), Stanford (5) and Louisiana State (5).\nYear by year results.\nConference tournament winners noted with # Source \nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Sooners have appeared in 22 NCAA tournaments, with a record of 34–22.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\nThe following lists where the Sooners have been seeded in the NCAA tournament."

        "title": "Rugby union in South Korea",
        "text": "Rugby union in South Korea is a minor but growing sport. Of the two Korean nations, the game tends to be mostly played in South Korea; North Korea's mostly small rugby union presence is limited to Koreans in Japan.\nGoverning body.\nThe Korean Union was set up in 1946, and affiliated to the IRFB in 1988.\nHistory.\nIt is unknown when rugby was first played in Korea. During the mid-19th century, European sailors are recorded as playing some of the earliest games in north east Asia, in ports such as Shanghai and Yokohama in neighbouring China and Japan, but it is unclear whether this occurred in Korea itself.\nHowever, it seems certain it had some presence by the mid-20th century. Korea was to become occupied by Japan, the main rugby playing nation of Asia, and it could well have been introduced then. South Korea still maintains a fierce rivalry with Japan to this day.\nAfter World War II, and later, during the period of the Korean War, the large influx of troops from Commonwealth countries cemented its presence. One legacy of this is that South Korean rugby has traditionally been strongest in the army.\nHowever, South Korean rugby has a second string to its bow. The massive growth of the economy since the 1960s, meant that a number of Korean corporations were to set up company teams along the lines of those in Japan, and this has broken up the former dominance of the military.\nSouth Korea made a failed attempt to have rugby union at the Olympic Games readmitted, when they hosted the games in Seoul. Roh Tae-woo, who was South Korean president at the time, had been a player.\nSouth Korea have emerged as an important rugby nation in Asia, since they won the Asian Championship in 1990.\nNotable players include-\nExpatriate rugby.\nExpatriate rugby was first played in Korea in 1972. An expat team called the Seoul Wanderers were formed to give opposition to both the local university teams and stationed army teams. This team was made up of players from the UK, New Zealand, and Australia. The team was disbanded in 1976.\nIn early 1979 Franz Misch, Mike Seros and Brad Handley got together and formed a new club - the Seoul Survivors RFC. The club is still around today. \nToday a range of expat teams exist in South Korea which sees teams play rugby 10's in KERA-Korean Expat Rugby Association League. Unfortunately, a few clubs have disbanded due to the nature of expat-life - notably Daejeon and Daegu. Currently four clubs compete in the KERA League - Seoul Survivors RFC , Busan Rugby Club, Ulsan Goblins RFC and the Stars &amp; Stripes RFC (US Armed Forces). Each club has the opportunity to host a tournament and showcase the game in their respective cities. This has led to growing support for the game of Rugby Union. Many players travel considerable distances to practice with, and play for one of the mentioned teams. This is due to the fact that the pool of players are generally too small to support teams in the smaller cities and country-side of the Republic of Korea.\nThe Busan Rugby Club is one of the clubs that have experienced rapid growth in player numbers and support. This is due to the fact that Busan is the second largest city in South Korea, is a popular summer destination (notably Haeundae beach and Gwangali beach) and has a large expat population. The club also draws considerable player numbers from the province located around Busan, Gyeonsangnam-do. Starting in 2016, the Busan Rugby Club showed a huge revival in their efforts to be recognized as a leading expatriate rugby club in Korea, by appointing a qualified coach, focus on training, and winning matches. Their hard work and concerted efforts paid off handsomely when they made history in 2017, by winning the KERA 2017 League trophy (The Joe Day Cup), The South Sea Cup and the KERA 2017 Knock Out Shield for the first time in the club's history. Busan Rugby then repeated their 2017 success by retaining the Joe Day Cup in 2018.\nUpdated information about the latest match results and current league standings are available at KERA."

The team was given high expectations after advancing to the NCAA tournament Elite Eight in 2008.\nThis season was highlighted by the individual performance of Stephen Curry, who was the nation's leading scorer after switching from shooting guard to point guard. He averaged 28.6 points and 5.6 assists per game. Stephen also took the school record of career point-scorer from former All-American John Gerdy. After the season, Stephen announced his entry into the 2009 NBA Draft, ending his Davidson career.\nThe season ended on a disappointing note, as the Wildcats unexpectedly lost to College of Charleston in the SoCon Tournament semifinals, resulting in their omission from the NCAA basketball tournament.

        "text": "Six-red snooker (sometimes spelled six-reds, 6-red, and also known as super 6s), is a variant of snooker, but with only six initially on the table as opposed to the standard fifteen.\nOverview.\nIn Six-red snooker, the traditional game of snooker is shortened, with fewer red-balls to pot. All the usual Snooker rules apply with the following exceptions:\nThe maximum break in six-red snooker is 75, as compared to 147 for traditional snooker. The table is the same size as in the traditional 15-red game. The format was designed to feature shorter frames, due to fewer red balls.\nIt was hoped that the format would revive the popularity of snooker as a spectator sport, in the same way Twenty20 has done to cricket. Jimmy White said that six-red snooker could be one way of helping boost the game's popularity. Ali Carter also said he would be interested in playing the format.\nThe first international tournament in this format was contested in July 2008, with Ricky Walden defeating Stuart Bingham in the final. A six-red tournament was held during the 2009 World Snooker Championship as a sideshow, involving one-frame knockout matches. In the final veteran Tony Knowles defeated 13-year-old Ross Muir 52–18. Tickets were initially free; however, future events would have been pay-to-enter. The first world championship was held in Ireland between 15 and 18 December 2009. Mark Davis beat Mark Williams 6–3 in the final, becoming the first world champion of the six-red snooker format.\nSince this time, the Six-red World Championship has been contested in the regular season calendar, and also in the Asian Indoor and Martial arts games.\nTen-red snooker.\nA similar game consisting of ten red balls, rather than six is also played. Popular in the women's game, ten-red had a World Women's 10-Red Championship held annually in Leeds, England, from 2017 to 2019."

        "text": "John Griffin (2 August 1859 – 13 July 1895) was an English medical doctor who became an international rugby union forward for Wales despite having no connections to the country.\nPersonal background.\nGriffin was born in Southampton in 1859, the eldest son of Dr. R. W. Waudby Griffin. He was partly educated at St Bartholomew's Hospital before gaining a place at Edinburgh University from which he qualified. During the late 1880s Griffin emigrated to South Africa in an attempt to improve his health, after suffering from hemoptysis. He first spent some time in Pretoria as a locum tenens before gaining a more permanent position in Port Elizabeth, where he set up a practice. After several years his health improved and in 1893 he travelled back to England in charge of small-pox patients on board a steamship. On his return to South Africa it was obvious he was suffering from tuberculosis and his condition worsened. In 1895 he returned to Southampton to spend his last days at his mother's home where he died on 13 July.\nRugby career.\nGriffin was awarded his one and only international cap as part of the 1883 Home Nations Championship. Wales had only been playing rugby as an international country for two years when the team played in the 1883 Championship. This was the inaugural tournament and the fixture between Scotland and Wales was the first rugby encounter between the two countries. When Wales arrived in Edinburgh the party was a player short for the match, in similar circumstances to the 1882 clash with Ireland, and attempts were made to draft a player to fill the missing position. Griffin was at the time studying at Edinburgh University and had played rugby for the University team. Although not Welsh, the fact that he was English, made him the 'least Scottish' person to choose from and was brought into the Welsh squad. Griffin was one of three new caps in the Welsh squad, the others being Horace Lyne and John Arthur Jones, all three playing in the pack. Wales lost the game by three goals to one and Griffin returned to his studies and did not represent Wales again.\nAs part of the first British Isles tour to South Africa in 1889, the British side played three tests against the South African team. The first test was held in Port Elizabeth, and the game was refereed by Griffin.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

He played for the Grays Harbor Loggers and Little Falls Mets, hitting a combined .297 with 23 stolen bases in 66 games.

As the telecast began, winds up to 24 mph (38 km/h) began to deposit dust onto the lane surface, making the lanes virtually unplayable with standard reactive equipment and angles. Players began switching to plastic bowling balls as the dust continued to accumulate. Kelly Kulick survived a 170–160 final match against Missy Parkin to take the title.\nThe tournament was not held in 2014, due to lack of viable sponsorship. Instead, the BPAA Women's All-Star returned for a year along with the Senior Women's US Open. The U.S. Women's Open returned for 2015, as the USBC and BPAA announced that Bowlmor AMF, the largest operator of bowling centers in the world, had signed on as the title sponsor.

        "title": "World Series of Poker Casino Employee Championship",
        "text": "The Casino Employees Championship is one of only three closed tournaments awarding WSOP bracelets at the World Series of Poker gathering. While most of the events are open to the general public, participants in the Ladies Championship, Seniors Championship, and the Casino Employees Championship must meet certain eligibility requirements. While these events are closed, the winner of these events is \"afforded the same distinction as all gold bracelet tournaments.\" The WSOP bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win.\nHistory.\nThe World Series of Poker (WSOP), held annually in Las Vegas, is \"the oldest, largest, most prestigious, and most media-hyped gaming competition in the world\". In 2000, the WSOP started to honor Casino Employees by offering a bracelet event that only they could enter. The first tournament was called the \"Dealers World Poker Championship\" because it was limited to poker dealers. The following year the field was open to all casino employees.\nSince the tournament is restricted to casino employees, most of the big name poker professionals and previous bracelet winners are not allowed to participate. Therefore, even though the Casino Employee Championship is a World Series of Poker bracelet event, it has typically received relatively little coverage. Despite this perception, the Casino Employee Championship event does involve numerous recognized names in the poker world. The 2009 tournament included two time bracelet winner Pat Poels, WSOP vice president Ty Stewart, Bellagio Tournament Director/Former WSOP Director Jack McClelland, and Woman Poker Hall of Famer Marsha Waggoner.\nPrior to 2003, the tournament format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, was the largest field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the exception of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started on the first day of the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivalries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.\nHighlights.\nIn 2000, Dave Alizadeth from Las Vegas outlasted a field of 109 participants to become the first \"Dealers World Poker Championship\". While other Dealer Tournaments had a reputation for sloppy play, the first Dealer Championship was noted for the seriousness with which the players approached the game. In the end, however, the winner was not determined by the deal of the cards, but by a deal at the table. According to initial reports, the deal was only achieved because \"a World Series bracelet was not available for negotiation, the players decided to take their money and go home.\" Other sources, however, indicate that the event was always intended to be a bracelet event. Either way, the official WSOP standings, credits Alizadeth with winning a WSOP bracelet at this event. By contrast the final three contestants at the 2003 Championship were doing Kamikaze shots. \"We were all having such a great time,\" the winner David Lukaszewski said, \"sitting around playing poker that I think we may have forgotten about the prize money and the bracelet.\"\nThe 2002 Casino Employee Championship almost mirrored Treetop Straus's amazing comeback in the 1982 WSOP Main Event. At the 1982 Main Event, Treetop was down to one $500 chip and came back to win the tournament. At the Casino Employee Championship, Dave Crunkleton, who has made 11 final WSOP tables but never won a bracelet, was down to one $500 chip with only four players left in the tournament. Crunkleton went all in with pocket eights and then succeeded in rebuilding his stack to $26,000 before being busted in third place. The 2002 winner, David Warga went on to become the first Casino Employee Champion to win a WSOP open event in 2010.\nMany top professional poker players got their start working in casinos. 1998 WSOP Main Event Champion and five time bracelet winner, Scotty Nguyen's first job was as a dealer. Ted Forrest, another five time bracelet winner, credits his ability to read players because of his experience as a dealer. One-time bracelet winner Erick Lindgren also boasts a pedigree of starting out as a dealer."

        "text": "David John Daniel (1871 – 30 April 1948) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Llanelli and international rugby for Wales.\nPersonal history.\nDaniel was born in 1871 in Llanelli. He married Francis Ann Roberts and they had thirteen children. His son William Daniel was a boxer of some note, fighting under the name \"Gipsy Daniels\" he became British light-heavyweight boxing champion in 1927. Daniel was a mason by trade but also worked as a brewery worker.\nRugby career.\nDaniel came to note as a rugby player for first class side Llanelli. It was while playing for Llanelli that Daniel was first selected to represent Wales, an away game against Scotland as part of the 1891 Home Nations Championship. Daniel was one of three new caps in the Welsh squad for the Scotland game, but the only one brought into the pack. Under the captaincy of veteran forward Willie Thomas, Wales were outclassed by Scotland, who scored seven tries without reply. The next game of the Championship saw a vastly altered Welsh pack with four new caps, Daniel was one of the players dropped.\nDaniel failed to be reselected for three years, but in 1894, the year after Wales had won the Triple Crown, he was brought back into the pack as a replacement for Newport's David Samuel. Daniel kept his place throughout the Championship, which saw Wales lose to England and Ireland, but win at home to Scotland. Despite the fact the Daniel had held down a position for the full series, the next season he was again replaced, this time by William Elsey who was in turn replaced by Ernie George after a single game.\nAnother four seasons passed, and Daniel was again back in favour with the Welsh selectors, when he came into the Welsh squad to face Ireland as part of the 1898 Home Nations Championship. This was the first Wales match after the Gould Affair, and Daniel found himself the veteran pack leader, with five of the pack newly capped that match, and the other two positions held by Fred Cornish and Dick Hellings, both having played just a single game each. This meant that Daniel had twice as many caps as the entire seven other pack members combined. Despite the inexperience of the Welsh pack, Wales were victorious over the Irish, winning 11-3. The selectors reacted by keeping faith in the Welsh squad, which saw no newly capped players, and Daniel leading out an almost unchanged pack against England at Blackheath. Despite a try and a dropped goal from Viv Huzzey, Wales lost the game.\nDaniel's final season with Wales was during the 1899 Home Nations Championship. After a record win over England, Daniel missed the away game to Scotland, replaced by Fred Scrine, but returned for the home game to Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park; Daniel's final Wales international match.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Jones was a tinplate furnaceman by occupation and lived in Taibach all his life.\nRugby career.\nEvans first played club rugby for his hometown club of Taibach, before switching to Aberavon. Although Aberavon was an improving club it was still not a fashionable club to play for and had yet to provide an international player. In 1897 as part of the Home Nations Championship Jones made history for the club by being chosen to represent Wales. The Welsh team had been experiencing several years of unstable partnerships at half-back, and the opening match of the 1897 Championship was no exception, with Jones brought in with veteran player Selwyn Biggs as replacements for Llewellyn Lloyd and Fred Parfitt. The previous season's encounter with England had ended in a humiliating loss for Wales, but with a much changed team, the Welsh were far more competitive in the 1897 game. Wales beat England 11–0, with Jones scoring one of three Welsh tries, the other two coming from Arthur Boucher and Tom Pearson. Jones may have been selected for further games that season, but due to the Gould Affair, Wales left the International Rugby Board and could not play in any further international games. By the time Wales were reinstated, Jones' place had been taken by Cardiff's Jack Elliott, and Jones did not represent his country again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Northwestern Wildcats women's lacrosse",
        "text": "The Northwestern Wildcats women's lacrosse team is an NCAA Division I college lacrosse team representing Northwestern University as part of the Big Ten Conference. It was a member of the American Lacrosse Conference until the 2013-14 season, when the conference was dissolved as the Big Ten was sponsoring women's lacrosse from the 2014-15 season. The team began competition at the varsity level in 1982, operated as a club sport from 1993 to 2001, and resumed play at the varsity level in 2002. They play their home games at Lanny &amp; Sharon Martin Stadium and Ryan Fieldhouse in Evanston, IL. From 2005 to 2009, the team won the NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship five consecutive times and recorded two undefeated seasons. After losing in the finals in 2010, the Wildcats added their sixth and seventh championships in 2011 and 2012. The Wildcats won their eighth championship in 2023. The Midwestern team's success is a rarity in a sport that enjoys most of its popularity on the East Coast - the Wildcats are the only team from outside the Eastern Time Zone to win the national title.\nHistory.\nThe Wildcats began playing in 1982 and enjoyed success early, appearing in the NCAA tournament five times before budget cuts forced the team to disband in 1993. Northwestern hired former Maryland player Kelly Amonte Hiller to be the head coach when the university revived the team in 2002. Hiller had to think outside the box in forming her squad; she recruited two freshmen who had never played the game before after seeing them jog around campus (they went on to be named All-Americans). Her methods proved successful, however, and the team improved its record every year from its inception until 2005, when the Wildcats went undefeated and won their first national title. Two years and two more championships later in 2007, they joined Maryland as the only teams to win three consecutive national titles. The Wildcats would take home championship trophies again in 2008 and after a second undefeated season in 2009. The streak ended in 2010 when the team lost to Maryland in a championship game that set the attendance record for a women's lacrosse match in the United States. During their five-year championship run, the Wildcats had a record of 106-3 and were undefeated at home. The Wildcats started a new streak the following year when they won their sixth championship, and then a seventh in 2012. Their streak of finals appearances would end in 2013 following a Final Four loss to the North Carolina Tar Heels.\nWhen the team visited the White House after winning their first championship, they created a minor fashion scandal when some members wore flip-flops. The publicity inspired the team to auction off their sandals with the proceeds going to the Friends of Jaclyn charity. The team first met Jaclyn Murphy in 2005 when she was recovering from a brain tumor and their support prompted her father to start a charity that matches other college teams with pediatric brain tumor patients.\nIndividual career records.\nReference:\nSeasons.\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus.\nPostseason Results.\nThe Wildcats have appeared in 24 NCAA tournaments. Their postseason record is 54-16."

        "text": "Kevin Samuel Locke (born 4 April 1989), also known by the nickname of \"Knobby\", is a New Zealand former professional rugby league footballer who plays for the Northcote Tigers in the Auckland Rugby League. He previously played for the New Zealand Warriors in the National Rugby League and for the Salford Red Devils and Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in the Super League. He primarily plays as a and .\nPlaying career.\nA Northcote Tigers junior who attended Northcote college, Locke first gained attention when he played for the Auckland Lions in the NSWRL Premier League in 2007. In 2008 he was signed by the New Zealand Warriors and played in the Toyota Cup, finishing the season as the competition's second highest points scorer.\nOn 31 May 2009 Locke made his first grade début in round 12 against the Wests Tigers. He scored two tries and kicked one goal on début as the Warriors won 14–0. The Warriors failed to make the finals of the 2009 NRL Premiership, but Locke finished the season as the club's top point-scorer. He finished his Toyota Cup career at the end of 2009, having made thirty appearances, scoring eighteen tries and ninety nine goals.\nOn 27 June 2010, Locke grabbed his first hat-trick in first grade, bagging three tries as the Warriors defeated the Sydney Roosters 20–18 at AMI Stadium in Christchurch. In scoring his third and final try, Locke injured his hip when colliding with the goalpost, but it was later disclosed that the injury was not as serious as was first feared.\nLock played fullback for the New Zealand Warriors in their 24–10 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the 2011 NRL Grand Final. The game was played in front of 81,988 fans at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney.\nLocke remained at the club for 2012 after the New Zealand Warriors exercised an option on his contract. He then signed a contract with the club until the end of the 2014 season. However, Locke's position with the warriors was put under threat by the signing of English fullback Sam Tomkins from Wigan.\nIn May 2014, Salford Red Devils RLFC of the Super League announced Locke had signed a three-year deal to play for them, beginning in October 2014 ahead of the 2015 season, having rejected offers from Union clubs Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow Warriors.\nThe Salford club then negotiated his early release from the New Zealand Warriors, where in 2014 he had languished in the Warriors NSW Cup side with Tomkins preferred in the top grade and he arrived to make his début for the English club during the 2014 season at Huddersfield. Locke scored a try and kicked six goals in a 10–36 win.\nOn 26 June 2015, he signed for then-bottom Super League club Wakefield Trinity Wildcats until the end of the season, pending a visa being granted. In December 2015, video footage was revealed of Locke being the passenger in a car driven by fellow Wakefield player Tim Smith who had crashed the vehicle into wall of a house. Locke was later released by the club over the incident with Wakefield chairman, Michael Carter confirming the news stating \"Kevin won’t play for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats again,” said Carter. “We’ve concluded the case involving him, shook hands and gone our own ways\".\nIn June 2016 Locke signed a deal with Shute Shield rugby union side Southern Districts &amp; agreed to join the Western Sydney Rams in the NRC, however failed to get accustomed to the code-switch &amp; spent most of the season playing in the lower grades, he was subsequently left out of the NRC squad for the Rams. In November 2016, Locke signed a contract to join Manly. He was released during the pre-season and signed with the Sunshine Coast Falcons in the Queensland Cup. He was released and returned to New Zealand to play for the Point Chevalier Pirates in the Fox Memorial Shield mid season, 2016. Locke would later join the Northcote Tigers in the local Auckland competition.\nRepresentative career.\nIn 2006 Locke made the Junior Kiwis side.\nIn 2008 Locke played for the New Zealand Māori against the New Zealand national rugby league team in a warm-up to the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.\nIn 2009, Locke was named by the New Zealand national rugby league team in the 23 man squad to play in the Four Nations tournament in Europe, however he did not play a match for the Kiwis.\nLocke again played for the New Zealand Māori in 2010 against England.\nOn Sunday 16 October 2011 Locke made his début for the Kiwis against the Kangaroos at Hunter Stadium (formerly Ausgrid Stadium), playing in the fullback position. He had a strong game and scored a try, however the Kiwis went down heavily to Australia, with a final scoreline 42–6.\nLocke played fullback for New Zealand in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup final at the famous Old Trafford ground in Manchester, England, though Australia won the game 34–2 to regain the World Cup they had lost to the Kiwis in 2008. Due to the presence of Sam Tomkins at the Warriors in 2014, Locke languished in the Warriors NSW Cup side and as a consequence lost his place in the NZ test team to well performed Manly Sea Eagles utility back Peta Hiku for the 2014 Anzac Test at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nPersonal life.\nWhen he was 23, Locke was sentenced in the Auckland District Court to 80 hours community work and fined $1400 for driving while disqualified on 12 May 2012, but avoided a further driving ban; his club also fined him $5000. Locke has been suspended for driving twice as a result of demerit points and has been caught speeding on seven occasions.\nLocke married Australian Netballer Chelsea Locke (née Pitman) on 30 December 2015."

The International Fencing Federation (FIE) comprised only European federations at the time, with the exception of the United States. In 1936, on the 25th anniversary of the FIE and at the request of the Italian federation, the FIE congress decided to open the European Championships to all countries and granted retroactive recognition of the European Championships as World Championships.\nAfter 1937 the FIE focused on the organisation of the World Fencing Championships. Demand for European Championships appeared at the 1979 congress, but it was rejected on the ground that they would either belittle the World Championships or offer a poor fencing level. The question was put forth again the following year by the Yugoslav federation, with the support of the Italian federation, which offered to organize the first competition. The congress agreed to authorize such championships, on the condition that they would be held only when the World Championships were organized in a non-European country. The first edition took place in Foggia, Italy on 11 and 12 November 1981.

He was signed by the Seattle Mariners in 2000 and played several seasons in minor league baseball before he appeared in the major leagues. He has played with the San Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres, Houston Astros and Hiroshima Toyo Carp.\nMinor league career.\nGuzmán was signed by the Seattle Mariners as an undrafted free agent in 2000. He played in the Venezuelan leagues from 2001 through 2003 as a teenager. Guzmán came to the United States in 2004 and played with the Seattle High-A and Double-A affiliates through 2007 when he was granted free agency. The Oakland Athletics signed Guzmán as a minor league free agent, and he played for three Athletics minor league clubs in 2008 before again being granted free agency. He posted a .364 batting average with the Double-A Midland RockHounds, and a .237 average in a limited 59 at-bats with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats, but his defense was a liability and he made 22 errors in 317 chances in 2008 while playing third and second base.\nThe San Francisco Giants signed Guzmán as a minor league free agent and invited him to spring training in 2009. He had an impressive spring, hitting .404 in Cactus League games, but in late March he was sent to learn to play first base in minor league games where his footwork on defense would not be as crucial. Guzmán began the 2009 season with the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies, where he spent most of the season apart from a few short stints with the Major League club. He accumulated a .321 batting average and a .885 OPS in 115 games at Triple-A, playing first base almost exclusively.\nGuzmán spent all of 2010 with the Giants' Triple-A club, where he posted nearly identical numbers to 2009, a .321 batting average and .886 OPS in 125 games, while playing mostly in left field and at third base.\nMajor league career.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nGuzmán was promoted from Triple-A and made his major league debut with the San Francisco Giants on May 21, . He had 20 plate appearances in 12 games in 2009 spread over May, July, and September, making two starts at first base and one as a DH.\nOn January 22, 2010, Guzmán was designated for assignment by the San Francisco Giants to make room on the 40-man roster for Bengie Molina, and on February 4 Guzmán was outrighted to Triple-A where he spent all of 2010.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn November 20, Guzmán signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. He had his contract purchased by San Diego on June 16, 2011. \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" wrote that Guzmán line-drive hitting style was perfectly suited to the Padres' home at Petco Park, and he emerged as the best hitter on their 2011 team, hitting .312 with a .847 OPS in 247 at-bats. However, he was not a proficient fielder at either first base or left field. Padres general manager Jed Hoyer projected Guzmán as a second option at first base (behind Yonder Alonso) in 2012, otherwise he was a possibility in left field.\nIn 2012, Guzmán made the majority of starts in left field in April and May while Carlos Quentin was rehabbing a sore knee, and he returned to the position in September when Quentin's knee again bothered him. Otherwise, he made occasional starts at first and in right field, and he made 50 appearances as a pinch hitter. In a total of 321 plate appearances over 120 games, Guzmán hit .247 with a .737 OPS and 9 home runs.\nGuzmán made the Padres 25-man roster in 2013 as a reserve outfielder and first baseman. He made 25 starts in left field, allowing Carlos Quentin to rest his knees early and late in the season. He also made 33 starts at first base, many in late June and early July when Yonder Alonso was out with a hand injury. Overall in 2013, Guzmán appeared in 126 games, and had 288 at-bats, including 48 as a pinch hitter. He hit .226 with a .675 OPS and 9 home runs.\nHouston Astros.\nOn December 18, 2013, Guzmán was traded to the Houston Astros in exchange for Ryan Jackson. He appeared in 69 games for the Astros, primarily at first base, and hit .188 with a .520 OPS. He was outrighted off the roster on October 9, 2014.\nHiroshima Toyo Carp.\nOn October 26, 2014, it was announced that he had signed a one-year $1 million contract with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball. After the season, he signed a minor-league contract with the Chicago Cubs organization.\nChicago Cubs.\nGuzmán signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs in January 2016. He was released in March.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn April 18, 2016, Guzman signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican Baseball League to be a pitcher. He was released on May 29, 2016.\nPersonal life.\nGuzmán has a wife, Yolimar, and a daughter, Brianna Barbara."

        "title": "Mike Rizzo (baseball)",
        "text": "Michael Anthony Rizzo (born December 14, 1960) is an American baseball front office executive who is the president of baseball operations and general manager of the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB).\nAfter a brief playing career in minor league baseball, Rizzo transitioned into coaching and scouting. He became the director of scouting for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2000. Rizzo joined the Nationals in 2006 as an assistant general manager. He succeeded Jim Bowden as the Nationals' general manager in 2009, and was promoted to team president in 2013. Rizzo and the Nationals won the franchise's first World Series in , defeating the Houston Astros in seven games.\nEarly life.\nRizzo, a third-generation scout, grew up in Chicago as one of four children to Phil and Bernadine Rizzo. His father, Phil, was a former minor league baseball player who drove a truck for the city and scouted for the California Angels on a part-time basis. The Angels eventually made Phil a full-time scout. Many of the players he identified reached the majors. After 50 years in professional baseball, Phil was eventually part of the inaugural induction class that entered the Professional Baseball Scouts Hall of Fame in 2008. Phil continued his scouting career with the Nationals as a senior advisor to the GM until he passed away on February 1, 2020. Mike Rizzo's grandfather, Vito, was a semi-pro player before founding the family business: scouting.\nRizzo attended Holy Cross High School in River Grove, Illinois, Triton College, and Saint Xavier University, where he played college baseball for the Triton Trojans and Saint Xavier Cougars. \nEarly career.\nThe Angels drafted Rizzo in the 22nd round, with the 554th overall selection, in the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft. He played for the Salem Angels (Class A Short Season), Peoria Suns (Class A) and Redwood Pioneers (Class A Advanced) from 1982 to 1984. After the 1984 season, the Angels released Rizzo. His father suggested that he was not skilled enough to reach the major leagues, and advised he attend college.\nRizzo became an assistant coach at the University of Illinois while earning a Bachelor of Arts in Communications in 1988. Larry Himes, the scout who drafted Rizzo, became the general manager of the Chicago White Sox, and he hired Rizzo as a scout for the Upper Midwest region. While with the White Sox, Rizzo signed 2014 Hall of Fame inductee and two-time American League MVP Frank Thomas. He also scouted for the Boston Red Sox. Rizzo joined the Arizona Diamondbacks when the franchise was created in 1998, and served as the director of scouting for the Diamondbacks from 2000 to 2006. He helped transform the Diamondbacks farm system with exceptionally successful drafts. Following the 2005 campaign, Rizzo was promoted to Vice President of Scouting Operations. That same year, the Diamondbacks were named Topps' Organization of the Year. Rizzo earned a World Series ring with Arizona in 2001, and the organization brought an astounding number of homegrown players through to the Major Leagues during his tenure. Brandon Webb (2006  Cy Young Award winner), Carlos Gonzalez, Chad Tracy, Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Dan Uggla, Micah Owings, Tony Pena, Mark Reynolds, Conor Jackson, Miguel Montero, Chris Snyder, Carlos Quentin, Max Scherzer and Brett Anderson were all signed by Arizona under Rizzo's watch.\nWashington Nationals.\nSeeking to replace Joe Garagiola Jr. as the Diamondbacks' general manager, the team chose Josh Byrnes over Rizzo. As a result, Rizzo joined the Washington Nationals organization, when he was appointed assistant general manager and vice president of baseball operations by Jim Bowden on July 24, 2006. This move coincided with the franchise's ownership transfer from Major League Baseball to a Washington, D.C.-based investment group headed by Ted Lerner.\nThree days after Bowden's sudden resignation on March 1, 2009, Rizzo was promoted to general manager on an interim basis by team president Stan Kasten. He was named the full-time senior vice president and general manager on August 20, 2009. On October 19, 2010, Rizzo signed a five-year contract extension and was promoted to executive vice president of baseball operations and general manager. The last two years of this contract were club options. \nOn June 24, 2021 at Miami, the Nationals beat the Marlins, 7-3, marking Rizzo's 1,000th win as general manager since taking over the club during 2009 Spring Training. In doing so, he became the ninth active president of baseball operations and general manager to reach the 1,000 win mark and the sixth active to do it with one team. Since 2012, the Nationals have the fifth-best regular season record in Major League Baseball over this span, behind only the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals and Cleveland Guardians. \nThe Nationals have had success under Rizzo, winning a World Series in 2019 and four National League East titles (2012, 2014, 2016, 2017) during his tenure. In April 2022, Rizzo was inducted into the Triton College Alumni Wall of Fame. In December 2021, he was named the Italian American Baseball Foundation Executive of the Year. After winning the World Series in 2019, he was named Executive of the Year by Baseball America and the Boston Chapter of the BBWAA. The Boston Chapter of the BBWAA also honored him with the same award following the 2012 season. He also garnered Executive of the Year honors in 2012 from the Pitch and Hit Club of Chicago, which followed 2011 Man of the Year honors from the Lido Civic Club of Washington, D.C.\nIn November of 2009, Rizzo convinced Davey Johnson to sign on as senior advisor and help revamp the Nationals' on-field operations. In June of 2011, Rizzo appointed him field manager and Johnson led the team to its first playoff appearance and through the 2013 season. On December 5, 2010, Rizzo signed right fielder Jayson Werth to a seven-year contract that immediately changed the perception of the Nationals. One year later, Rizzo signed franchise cornerstone Ryan Zimmerman, to a six-year contract extension. From 2009 to 2012 Rizzo's Nationals won at least 10 more games than the season prior: 59 wins in 2009, 69 in '10, 80 in '11, 98 in '12. The last team to do this was the Boston Red Sox from 1906 to 1909, making the Nationals the first team in over 100 years to complete such a feat without the benefit of an artificially deflated win total associated with a work stoppage. Rizzo shut down ace pitcher Stephen Strasburg late in the 2012 season as he recovered from Tommy John surgery from the year before. The Nationals promoted Rizzo to president of baseball operations during the 2013 season.\nTo strengthen the rotation before the 2015 season, Rizzo signed ace pitcher Max Scherzer to a seven-year contract, introducing him on January 21, 2015. In December 2015, Rizzo pulled off a three-team trade that netted shortstop Trea Turner and right-handed pitcher Joe Ross from the San Diego Padres and sent outfielder Steven Souza Jr. to the Tampa Bay Rays. With the 2016 Baseball Winter Meetings taking place at nearby National Harbor, Md., Rizzo acquired outfielder Adam Eaton from the White Sox in exchange for prospects Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning. In 2016, the team picked up its option to extend Rizzo's contract through the 2018 season. \nWith Washington ahead in the division by nearly 10.0 games following the 2017 All-Star break, Rizzo got a jump on the trade market on July 16, fortifying Washington's bullpen by acquiring relievers Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson from the Oakland Athletics. On July 28, he acquired veteran position player Howie Kendrick from the Philadelphia Phillies. Moments before the July 31 deadline, Rizzo further added to the bullpen with the acquisition of Minnesota Twins reliever Brandon Kintzler. On April 5, 2018, Rizzo signed a contract extension through the 2020 season. When Kendrick went down with an Achilles injury on May 19, 2018, Rizzo promoted19-year-old outfield prospect Juan Soto to the Major Leagues. \nAfter 11 seasons as the head of Washington's baseball operations, Rizzo's team won the 2019 World Series, defeating the Houston Astros in seven games. Rizzo's contract was then extended through 2023, giving him a raise above his $4 million per year salary.\nIn a span of roughly 26 hours from July 29-30, 2021, Rizzo and the Washington Nationals acquired 12 players via six trades around the trade deadline. Those 12 players included Josiah Gray, Keibert Ruiz, Riley Adams, Mason Thompson, Gerardo Carrillo and Donovan Casey, among others. Other notable contributors Rizzo has brought in via trade during his tenure include Nelson Cruz, Josh Bell, Gio Gonzalez, Tanner Roark, Blake Treinen, Mark Melancon, Wilson Ramos, Denard Span, Kurt Suzuki, Michael Morse, and Sean Burnett, among others.\nOn July 2, 2022, the Nationals exercised Rizzo's option for the 2023 season.\nPersonal life.\nRizzo lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Jodi. His son, Michael Jr. is an entrepreneur living in San Diego, Calif."

The defending champion from the 2008 World Cup Final and the reigning Olympic champions qualify automatically. The remaining eight qualify through a special point-awarding system based on their best performance during the World Cup season, skipping past automatic qualifiers. Not counting the defending and Olympic champions, there will be a maximum of two shooters per event from the same country.\nThe qualification system awards a win with 15 points, a silver medal with 10, a bronze medal with 8, a fourth place with 5, a fifth with 4, a sixth with 3, a seventh with 2 and an eighth place with 1 point. It also gives out points for qualification scores within a certain range from the current world record: from 1 point for fourteen points off the record, to 15 points for equalling or raising it."

        "title": "2002 Breeders' Cup betting scandal",
        "text": "The 2002 Breeders' Cup betting scandal was an incident that arose when computer programmer Chris Harn conspired with two friends, Derrick Davis and Glen DaSilva, to manipulate bets in the 2002 Breeders' Cup, held at Arlington Park in Arlington Heights, Illinois. This enabled him to arrange a $3 million USD payout to the trio. The scam was exposed when 43-1 longshot Volponi won the Breeders' Cup Classic. This unanticipated victory made Davis the sole winner of the Pick 6 jackpot. Eventually, Harn, Davis and DaSilva entered pleas of guilty.\nThe incident was the largest betting scandal to take place in the United States in a century. It also exposed serious security flaws in the system used to collect bets for horse races.\nBackground.\nHarn was a computer programmer at Autotote, which handled the wagers for 65 percent of horse races in North America at the time. In the fall of 2001, Harn discovered unclaimed ticket data that if claimed, would total hundreds of thousands of dollars. Using this data, he reprinted the unclaimed tickets so that he and his friends could claim them at local tracks. However, cashing them was another matter. As an Autotote employee, he was restricted from making wagers himself. In any event, he was too well known at the tracks to cash them.\nTo solve this problem, he talked DaSilva and Davis into cashing the tickets at various tracks. The three men had been friends and fraternity brothers at Tau Kappa Epsilon during their days at Drexel University. DaSilva now lived in New York City while Davis lived in Baltimore. Davis and DaSilva traveled to several tracks in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania to cash the vouchers. The three men then split the winnings.\nHowever, Harn soon realized that if they kept it up too long, they'd eventually be tracked down. He looked for a way to get one big payoff that could allow him to easily cover his tracks. He found it in the Breeders' Cup, the richest day in American horse racing. Harn decided to go for the Ultra Pick 6, in hopes of scoring a win by picking the winners of the six major races of the competition—the Classic, Turf, Sprint, Distaff, Juvenile and Mile.\nFinding a weak link.\nAt the time, all wagers placed at the numerous off-track betting parlors around the country that were still live after the second race of a Pick 4 and the fourth race of a Pick 6 were forwarded to Autotote headquarters in Newark, Delaware and to the track where the race was held. Harn discovered that there was a half-hour delay between the end of the second or fourth race and when the live wagers were forwarded—enough time to alter the results. Harn was uniquely positioned to take advantage of this weak link. He was a \"super user\"—the highest level of access at Autotote. In fact, he was responsible for maintaining the entire network.\nHe had DaSilva set up an account at the Catskill Off-Track Betting Corporation in Pomona, New York. Harn liked Catskill because its security was fairly lax. Unlike other OTB parlors, it didn't require the bettor to be physically present to open an account, and also didn't have a transaction history file. It was also a fairly low-traffic facility, making it easier to alter bets. He'd set up the system himself, so he knew how it could be exploited.\nThe scheme.\nHarn had DaSilva conduct two dry runs of their scheme. On October 3, DaSilva bet on the Pick 4 harness races at Balmoral Park, about 45 miles from Arlington Park. After the first two races, Harn logged in and altered the original bets on the first two races, then picked every horse in the last two races. As a result, DaSilva netted $80,000 in winnings. Two days later, Harn and DaSilva repeated the pattern in a Pick 6 at Belmont Park. This time, DaSilva scored $100,000. For the Breeders' Cup, Harn had Davis open an account at Catskill in case the authorities got suspicious of DaSilva. Davis then called Catskill from his home in Baltimore to buy a $12 Pick 6 ticket, picking one winner in the first four races.\nOn Breeders' Cup Day, Harn slipped into his office at Autotote. To make sure he was covered, he remotely ejected the backup tape at Catskill before the first race. He then took several calls from Davis while the races were underway. After the fourth race, and half an hour before the Turf, Harn hacked onto the system and tracked down Davis' bet. He then changed Davis' original bet to reflect the actual four winners. After having the Catskill techs reinsert the tape, he bet on every horse running in the Turf and Classic, assuring that he would win. The plan worked, and they were able to turn their original $1,152 bet into almost $3.1 million in winnings--$2.57 million for winning the Pick 6, plus $498,000 in consolation prizes for picking five out of six winners.\nSuspicions mount.\nUnfortunately for Harn and his friends, the Classic was won by Volponi, a 43-to-1 longshot. Had a horse won with shorter odds, or if more money had been bet on Volponi, there would have been more winners—and a smaller payout—and Davis' bet would have looked normal. As it turned out, Davis held the only jackpot winner.\nThe nature of the bet raised suspicions as well. While most bettors pick more than one horse to increase their chances of winning, as mentioned above Davis selected only one horse for the first four races and effectively played the same ticket six times. It also seemed unusual that all the bets were placed through Catskill, a fairly small operation. The New York Racing Association asked the New York State Racing and Wagering Board to launch an investigation. As a first step, the board asked Arlington Park and Catskill not to pay out Davis' winnings. The New York State Police, FBI and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York later joined in the investigation.\nHarn and Davis were very nervous, but finally decided their only course was to claim the bet was legitimate. Davis went to the press, maintaining his innocence. He said the only reason that the payout was so large was that he'd intended to make a $2 bet rather than the $12 bet he'd actually made. Davis demanded proof of any wrongdoing.\nCaught.\nThe fact that the nature of the ticket changed so abruptly after the first four races (the same four winners picked for the first four races on every bet and then every possible combination of horses in the last two races) led investigators to wonder early on if someone had hacked into the system and changed the ticket. Naturally, the focus turned to the Autotote system. Autotote immediately suspected an inside job, and questioned all of its employees in Newark. They soon discovered that Harn wasn't scheduled to work on the day of the race, but had still been in the office. Even more seriously, they discovered Harn had tapped into the system and altered Davis' ticket after the first four races. When Harn couldn't explain his activity or what he was doing at work in the first place, Autotote fired him and turned over the results of its own investigation to New York State and federal officials.\nInvestigators soon discovered that Harn and Davis had been members of Drexel's Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter. Not long after that, they discovered DaSilva had been a member of that fraternity at the same time as Harn and Davis, and also had an account at Catskill. They soon discovered that DaSilva's bets at Balmoral and Belmont were similar in nature to the larger bet Davis made at the Breeders' Cup—raising suspicions that they were dry runs for the Breeders' Cup bet. The New York State Police also seized computers from Autotote and Harn's house, and also subpoenaed Harn's phone records. On November 12, Harn, Davis and DaSilva were each charged with one count of wire fraud in White Plains, New York. James Comey, the U.S. Attorney for Southern New York, portrayed the scheme as a 21st-century version of \"The Sting\".\nIn the face of mounting evidence—including numerous calls from Davis' cell phone to Harn's Autotote phone and witnesses who saw Harn logged into the Catskill site while on the phone— Harn opted to cooperate with investigators. He not only admitted rigging the Breeders' Cup bet and the test runs he'd conducted with DaSilva, but also told investigators about his scheme to cash unpaid tickets—something they didn't know anything about. Federal law requires anyone cooperating with prosecutors to disclose all criminal activity in which they'd engaged.\nOn November 20—a week after the indictment—Harn pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and computer fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He admitted to rigging the Breeders' Cup, Balmoral and Belmont bets. He also admitted to bilking legitimate winners out of $92,500 with his duplicate ticket scheme. On December 11, DaSilva pleaded guilty to similar charges, but claimed he didn't know Davis was in on the scheme and that he took no part in the Breeders' Cup bet. The next day, Davis pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and gave up all claims to the money.\nOn March 20, 2003; Harn was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison. Davis received 37 months while DaSilva received two years. The $3.1 million payoff was split among 78 people who'd gotten five out of six races right; each got $39,000 in addition to their original $4,600 consolation prizes.\nFallout.\nEven though Autotote officials characterized the scheme as the actions of a \"rogue software engineer\", the National Thoroughbred Racing Association took swift action in the face of a growing outcry once the nature of the scam emerged. It required all tote companies to modify their software to transmit betting information immediately after the bet has closed. It also pressured its member tracks into not doing business with parlors that didn't have the ability to record wagers taken over the phone.\nThe scheme was profiled on the Canadian television series \"Masterminds.\""

        "title": "Hotshot (basketball)",
        "text": "Hotshot is a basketball shooting game. Played mainly in New England, hotshot may be played by one or more players. Hotshot is unique in that it is easy to provide handicaps for less experienced players, allowing them to compete with better shooters. Hotshot is also unique in that it may be manipulated to fit any time frame, from five minutes to over an hour.\nRules of play.\nFirst, players choose a spot on the court from which to \"shoot for the ball\". Players each take a shot and the first to hit a shot successfully wins first possession of the ball. Once a player has won the ball, he chooses a number of spots, called \"hotspots\", on the court, from which to shoot. The number of hotspots to be chosen is determined before the game. No hotspot may be inside the key.\nOnce the player has chosen his hotspots, he proceeds to his first and takes five shots, keeping track of how many he has missed. On the fifth shot, or \"hotshot\", the player must prepare to make his own rebound as quickly as possible, because he will have to make a number of shots from wherever he recovers the ball. If he recovers the ball outside the three-point line, he may take his shots from wherever the ball passed over the three-point line; if the player made his \"hotshot\", he may take his shots from wherever the ball left the key, if it is outside the key when recovered. If the player hits all five of his hotspot shots, he receives a twenty-point bonus and need not recover his rebound, but may move on to his next hotspot.\nIf the player did not go five for five, the spot where the player recovers his rebound is known as the \"offspot.\" In order to proceed to his next hotspot, the player must make as many shots as he missed in the previous round in a row from his offspot. For example, if the player missed three shots from his hotspot, he must make three in a row from his offspot to proceed. If the player misses five shots from his offspot before making the necessary shots in a row, he receives a zero and may proceed to his next hotspot.\nOnce a player has shot from each of his hotspots, he adds up his score, then gives the ball to the next player.\nScoring.\nWhen shooting from a hotspot, scoring is simple: a player receives five points for a hit shot, and zero points for a miss. When shooting from an offspot, a player must make the necessary number of shots in a row to score any points. If the player does succeed in making his necessary shots, he receives ten points minus twice the number of shots he missed from his offspot. For example, if the player missed two shots before completing his offspot round, he would receive 10 - 2*2 points, or 10 - 4 = 6 points for the offspot round.\nTournament play.\nHotshot can also be a tournament. In tournaments the game is different from normal in a few ways. First players have only a minute to complete their turn, and must get their own rebounds on every shot and hotspots are worth different numbers of points depending on their distance from the basket. Also, offspot rounds are generally not part of tournaments. Players may get a bonus if they finish their round in less than a minute.\nAlternate versions.\nPenalties - In some versions, a player receives a penalty for missing all five of his hotspot shots. The penalty varies from ten to twenty, and in some versions, the player does not get an offspot round but must move directly to his next hotspot.\n\"Sprees\" - In some versions, a player may choose to yell the word \"spree\" after making five out of five shots from his hotspot. Upon calling \"spree\", the player forfeits his twenty-point bonus, but may continue taking shots from his hotspot until he misses or reaches fifteen shots total (including the original five shots). Every shot is worth five points as if the hotspot round was still going, and thus a player may receive a maximum of 75 points total at one hotspot. If a player calls spree, he need not take an offspot round.\nHandicaps - In some versions, players must all shoot from the same hotspots. In others, players may choose their own, with experienced players choosing more challenging shots than the novices. This allows for novices to compete with more advanced players, evening out the playing field.\nSwitching turns - Sometimes, players shoot from all their hotspots before giving the ball to the next player. Sometimes, players may alternate after every hotspot. This is a personal choice and may be made before the game."

As a player, he set a Southwest Conference record with 32 points in 1933 which stood for 16 years. Gray was a First-Team All-American guard in 1935 and was All-SWC all three years of his varsity career. He was known for his one-handed \"push\" shot, a precursor of the jump shot.\nWith one year of coaching experience, Gray took over the coaching job at age 25. In his first six years as coach beginning in 1937, he led the Longhorns to five winning seasons and led the Longhorns to their first Elite Eight in the first NCAA tournament in 1939. After returning from World War II, Gray led the Longhorns to their first Final Four in the 1947 NCAA tournament. He coached Basketball Hall of Famer Slater Martin from 1944 to 1949.\nGray got his team in the National Invitation Tournament in 1948, their first AP Poll ranking (#20 in 1949).\nGray ranks third all-time in Longhorns basketball history in wins with 194 victories to 97 losses and had a final Southwest Conference record of 89–55. He was head coach for 12 years, which as of 2011, ranked as the second-longest basketball coaching term at University of Texas."

He played at representative level for Great Britain and Yorkshire, and at club level for Castleford and Keighley as a .\nPlaying career.\nClub career.\nBorn in Castleford, Edwards started his career with his hometown club Castleford during the 1960–61 season. He won his first trophy with the club in 1965, playing at full-back in Castleford's 4–0 victory over St. Helens in the inaugural BBC2 Floodlit Trophy final on Tuesday 14 December 1965. Castleford won the trophy again in the two following seasons, with Edwards playing in both games — a 7–2 victory over Swinton in the 1966 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy final on Tuesday 20 December 1966, and an 8–5 victory over Leigh in the 1967 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy final on Saturday 16 January 1968.\nDuring the 1968–69 season, Edwards played full-back in Castleford's 11–22 defeat by Leeds in the 1968 Yorkshire Cup final on Saturday 19 October 1968. At the end of the season, Castleford won the 1969 Challenge Cup final, with Edwards playing full-back in a 11–6 victory over Salford on Saturday 17 May 1969.

        "text": "Donald Zimmerman (born 1953) is a television analyst and former American college lacrosse coach. He became a color analyst for ESPN in May 2016 and does both high school and college lacrosse games. Prior to becoming an analyst, he served as the head coach for the UMBC Retrievers at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County for 24 years. Between 1984 and 1987, Zimmerman coached Johns Hopkins to three national championships. Zimmerman was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 2017.\nEarly life.\nZimmerman attended St. Paul's School in Brooklandville, Maryland. While there, the lacrosse team on which he played won three Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) championships. Zimmerman then attended Randolph-Macon College before he transferred to Johns Hopkins University. He played lacrosse as a midfielder for the Blue Jays in 1975 and 1976. His senior year, he received honorable mention All-American honors and the Turnbull-Reynold Award for leadership and sportsmanship. He graduated in 1976.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching positions.\nAfter graduating, Zimmerman remained at Hopkins for a season to coach the lacrosse program's B squad in 1977. He spent the following season as an assistant coach at Princeton University. From 1979 to 1982, he served as an assistant under Willie Scroggs at the University of North Carolina. While there, the Tar Heels won the national championship in 1981 and 1982.\nJohns Hopkins.\nIn 1983, he returned to his alma mater, and became the head coach in 1984 after the retirement of Henry Ciccarone. That year, he led the Blue Jays to a perfect 14–0 season and became the first head coach to win an NCAA championship in his first season. In 1985, Hopkins again won the national title while suffering one loss. The following year, the Blue Jays compiled a 10–2 record, and were eliminated in the semifinals in overtime by the eventual national champions, North Carolina. In 1987, Zimmerman led the team to a 10–3 record and a third title. Upon expiration of his contract, he left Hopkins after compiling a 6–5 record in 1990. The reason he cited was the pressure associated with the high-profile position. In total, Zimmerman's teams at Johns Hopkins posted a 73–15 record.\nFormer Hopkins head coach Dave Pietramala spent his entire college playing career under Zimmerman, from 1986 to 1989. Former North Carolina and Hopkins head coach John Haus played for the Tar Heels under Zimmerman and then served as his assistant at Johns Hopkins. Zimmerman was the United States men's national lacrosse team's assistant coach for the 1986 World Lacrosse Championship.\nUMBC.\nZimmerman spent three years at Loyola as an assistant for the Greyhounds under Dave Cottle, before he was hired as head coach by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). The Retrievers continued to struggle early in Zimmerman's tenure, and during his first three seasons compiled a 14–25 mark. After a 3–9 campaign in 1996, UMBC became the most improved team in the nation with a 9–3 record for the 1997 season. In 1998, the Retrievers delivered a major upset by beating, 12–8, then first-ranked Maryland, the eventual national championship runners-up. The victory helped UMBC secure its first ever berth in the NCAA tournament. In 1999, the Retrievers again made an appearance in the tournament. Zimmerman coached the South squad in the 2002 North-South Senior All-Star Game.\nIn 2005, UMBC posted a 5–1 conference mark to achieve the America East regular season conference championship. The following year, the Retrievers defeated Binghamton and Albany in the America East tournament for the conference championship, and Zimmerman made his tenth appearance as a head coach in the NCAA tournament. He was named the 2006 America East Coach of the Year. In 2007, UMBC again advanced past Binghamton before falling to Albany in the America East championship game, and secured another berth in the NCAA tournament. There, they upset seventh-seeded Maryland in the first round for the school's first appearance in the NCAA quarterfinals.\nIn 2008, UMBC again faced Albany in the America East championship game. Halfway through the second period, the Retrievers trailed 11–2, but rallied to edge their opponents, 14–13. Zimmerman was named the 2008 America East Coach of the Year. In June, he was considered the frontrunner to replace John Haus who had been fired as North Carolina's head coach, but Zimmerman removed his name from consideration. He said, \"The people at UMBC have been good to me, and this is my home ... these are my kids and I recruited them. I just didn't think this was the right time to move.\"\nIn 2009, UMBC captured its fifth consecutive outright or shared America East regular season title. In the conference semifinals, the Retrievers edged Binghamton, 9–8. In the final, however, UMBC jumped out to an early lead over Albany and never relinquished it, and won, 15–7. Zimmerman was named the 2009 America East Coach of the Year. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Retrievers faced sixth-seeded North Carolina. UMBC entered the game with the number-one ranked midfield in the nation, but it was lacking in depth, and the first-string was thus forced to play most of the game. The Retrievers led 8–6 at halftime, but North Carolina assumed control during the third period and went on to win, 15–13.\nWhile coach at UMBC, Zimmerman has traveled to Japan, Argentina, and the United Kingdom in order to promote the sport of lacrosse. In 2002, 2004, and 2006, UMBC hosted fall scrimmages against teams from Keio University. In the summer of 2005, the Retrievers traveled to Japan. Regarding the possibility of the sport being a future Olympic event, Zimmerman said, \"It’s incumbent upon us to introduce and develop the game when opportunities occur in order to reach that goal.\" The Greater Baltimore Chapter of the United States Lacrosse Hall of Fame inducted Zimmerman on January 25, 2003.\nPersonal life.\nZimmerman lives in Towson, Maryland with his wife, Dorothy. They have two adult children, a son and a daughter."

        "text": "England 2018 was the Football Association's unsuccessful bid for the right to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. FIFA invited bidding countries to bid for either the 2018 or the 2022 finals, or both. The FA initially decided to bid for both, but with the withdrawal of all non-European bids for the 2018 event, this bid, and that of all other European bidding nations, were effectively disqualified from eligibility for the 2022 edition.\nEngland's bid was managed by England 2018/2022 Bidding Nation Ltd. This company was established by The FA for the purpose of bringing the World Cup tournament to England for the first time since 1966. England attempted to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup but lost out to Germany. England hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup and had the campaign been successful, England would have become the sixth nation to host the World Cup for a second time. It won the right to host Euro 1996. Andy Anson, the chief executive of England 2018, called for humility with England's bid claiming they \"must not fall victim to arrogance\" and that lessons had been learned from the unsuccessful attempt to host the 2006 competition. Anson stated that \"the tone of this campaign has to be different.\nBid team.\nThe board of \"England 2018\" was chaired by Lord Triesman, chairman of The FA, who has since resigned. He was joined by Geoffrey Thompson, vice president of FIFA; Lord Mawhinney, chairman of the Football League; Paul Elliott, who is the chairman of the Advisory Group to the bid; and Lord (Sebastian) Coe, who led London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, is chairman of LOCOG, and who took leave of absence from his role as chairman of the FIFA Ethics Committee to join the bid team. The chief executive of England 2018 was Andy Anson, formerly chief executive for Europe of the ATP, and previously commercial director of Manchester United.\nThe non-executive and subsidiary Advisory Group to the bid consisted of Karren Brady, former managing director of Birmingham City; Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP; David Gill, chief executive of Manchester United; the former Minister for Sport, Gerry Sutcliffe and Sir Keith Mills, deputy chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG).\nThe bid had the support of Prince William, the FA's president. The vice presidents of England's 2018 bid team were David Beckham, England international and the country's second most capped player; John Barnes, a former England international; England manager Fabio Capello; Hope Powell, manager of the England women's team; Peter Kenyon, chief executive of Chelsea; Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the PFA; Terry Leahy, the chief executive of Tesco; and economist Nicholas Stern.\nThe England World Cup bid also received the assistance of Ronnie Flanagan as an advisor on safety and security.\nSchedule.\nThe FA announced its intention to bid on 31 October 2007, and the Bid Registration Form was issued to FIFA's headquarters in Zürich on 17 March 2009. Detailed applications needed to be submitted to FIFA by December 2009, with the final submission of full details of the bid being sent by 14 May 2010. The host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments were announced in December 2010.\nEngland's bid was officially presented for the first time on 18 May 2009 by Adrian Chiles in the Bobby Moore Room at Wembley Stadium. England players from past and present including Wayne Rooney and Sir Bobby Charlton gave their support with Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with the support of Conservative Party leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg. The presentation also received an endorsement from West Ham United's Italian manager Gianfranco Zola and he believed that England 'would be a great place to play a World Cup'. After the presentation, the bid team spoke with representatives from each of the fifteen potential host cities.\nDetails.\nOne host city may have two designated World Cup stadiums though all others may have only one stadium in use. However, England's bid can contain more than one city with two stadiums or more. Now that the England bid team has put forward a number of potential host cities and venues, it is now the decision of FIFA to choose the final list of cities and stadia in late 2010. This would outline the venues of the World Cup if England were chosen to host the tournament.\nStadiums must also be able to accommodate a hospitality village no more than 150 metres from the stadium. They must have a capacity of at least 40,000 for group and second round matches and 60,000 for quarter finals and beyond, while the final must be played at a venue with a capacity of 80,000.\nWith regard to selecting a host city, FIFA and the England 2018 bid team assessed the candidates' capabilities to deliver on a number of areas including:\nVenues.\nA total of fifteen stadia from twelve cities were proposed to FIFA. Had England's bid been successful, the final decision on which would host matches would have been made in 2013. Three stadia would have been forwarded from London: Wembley Stadium, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium and either the Olympic Stadium or Tottenham Hotspur's yet-to-be-built new ground (if the latter were ready). At the time of bidding, the Olympic Stadium was under construction for the Olympic games in 2012; its future following the Olympics was unclear and beyond the control of the World Cup bid committee, and so the Tottenham ground was put forward alongside it. It was not made clear during the bid which stadium would have been preferred had both stadia been viable candidates in 2013.\nThe other stadia that were nominated were Sunderland's Stadium of Light, Birmingham's Villa Park, the New Nottingham Forest Stadium, Elland Road in Leeds, Sheffield's Hillsborough Stadium, St James' Park in Newcastle, the new Bristol City Stadium, Plymouth's Home Park, Old Trafford and the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, and, in Liverpool, either the existing Anfield or the proposed Stanley Park Stadium. In the case of Liverpool, the bid committee determined that the current Anfield stadium would have been, with minor improvements, acceptable for World Cup matches; however, because of Liverpool FC's plans to build a new ground, the committee specified that the new stadium would take the place of Anfield if it were ready in time.\nMany of the stadia selected would have required minor modernisation in order to meet the strict requirements for holding World Cup tournament games, as is usual for all pre-existing stadia. The grounds in Leeds, Sheffield, Milton Keynes and Plymouth in particular were all set for an increase in capacity, whilst new stadiums proposed in Nottingham and Bristol were a part of the bid.\na: Stadium used in 1966 FIFA World Cup\nb: Stadium used in UEFA Euro '96\nRejected bid venues.\nBefore the final decision was made by a 'technical panel', Derby, Kingston upon Hull, Leicester and Portsmouth (who later withdrew) were also among the list of possible venues until the 12 'final cities' were announced on 16 December 2009.\nOutcome and reaction.\nEngland's bid for the World Cup was unsuccessful, only receiving 2 out of 22 votes from the FIFA executive committee in the first round of voting. The rights to host the 2018 World Cup were eventually awarded to Russia.\nAt a conference in Qatar in March 2012, Premier League chairman and deputy chairman of the 2018 bid, Dave Richards, said FIFA allowed the FA to waste money on their 2018 World Cup bid when, he claimed, they had little chance of winning it, stating \"Why couldn't FIFA have said we want to take it to the Gulf? We spent £19m on that bid. When we went for it everybody believed we had a chance. But, as we went through it, a pattern emerged that suggested maybe we didn't.\" The Football Association and the Premier League distanced themselves from Richards' remarks, stressing that he was attending the conference in a personal capacity."

Princeton currently competes as a member of the Ivy League and plays its home games at the Class of 1952 Stadium in Princeton, New Jersey.\nPrior to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, Princeton was voted as national champion six times, in 1884, 1885, 1937, 1942, 1951, and 1953. Princeton also went undefeated in Ivy League play from 1957 to 1963 (Ivy League lacrosse began in 1956), and tied with Harvard in 1960 in an otherwise perfect season. Between 1957 and 1965, the team won nine consecutive Ivy League titles. The team has since won ten consecutive Ivy League titles from 1995 through 2004. Between 1990 and 2003, Princeton appeared in 14 consecutive NCAA tournaments.\nSince 1990, Princeton has won six NCAA national championships and has qualified for 21 of 31 Division I NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournaments. All six championships were won under former head coach Bill Tierney, who coached the team from 1988 to 2009. Tierney also led the Princeton program to two second-place finishes. In 2010, Chris Bates took over as head coach of the Princeton program. In 2010, Princeton won the inaugural Ivy League Lacrosse Tournament.\nHistory.\nPrinceton has been voted national champion six times (1884, 1885, 1937, 1942, 1951 and 1953). Some sources regard 1937 as the first national championship. Men's lacrosse has been contested in the Ivy League since 1956, initially with only six teams. Brown University began competing in the league in 1964 and Columbia University has never competed in the league. Between 1957 and 1965, Princeton won nine consecutive Ivy League championships. It had undefeated 5–0 conference records every year from 1957 to 1963 except 1960 when it had a tie with Harvard. Between 1967 and 1992 Princeton won no Ivy League championships, while Cornell was the dominant conference power. Until the 1990s, Princeton played at Finney Field. Princeton won seven more Ivy League championships in the 1990s including perfect 6–0 records in 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. 1997 is regarded as the best in school history with a record number of wins during its 15–0 season and 10 All-Americans plus 13 All-Ivy League selections. Princeton has won 27 Ivy League championships, second to Cornell's 32. Since the Ivy League lacrosse tournament was introduced in 2010 Princeton has won it twice, in 2010 and 2023. The school has 21 NCAA Division I Championship appearances, and 6 NCAA championships.\nTheir main Ivy League rivalry is with Cornell. On the non-conference slate is the annual rivalry with Johns Hopkins, first played in 1890 and a constant national fixture since the 1990s. Princeton also plays Rutgers for the Meistrell Cup in honor of Harland (Tots) Meistrell who restarted the dormant lacrosse program at Rutgers in 1920 and then restarted the dormant lacrosse program at Princeton in 1921.\nPrinceton has had a Top VIII Award winner and two Lt. Raymond Enners Awards for national player of the year. The school has seven Ivy League Players of the Year and nine Ivy League Rookies of the Year. The team has also had numerous national position awardees: five Ensign C. Markland Kelly, Jr. Awards (goaltenders), three Jack Turnbull Awards (attackman), two McLaughlin Awards (midfielder), and six Schmeisser Awards (defenseman). Two Princeton head coaches have won the F. Morris Touchstone Award. Princeton's first first team All-American in 1922.\nChampionships.\nFrom 1936 through 1970, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the annual champion, based on regular-season records. In 1971, the NCAA began hosting an annual men's tournament to determine the national champion. The Wingate Memorial Trophy was presented to the first two NCAA Division I champions (1971 and 1972) and was then retired.\nNCAA Tournament History.\nThe following is the complete history of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse in the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship.\nHonors.\nThe following players have been recognized with conference or national honors and awards for their play:\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nNational Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\nNational Lacrosse Hall of Fame inductees:\nStatistical accomplishments.\nMichael Sowers holds the school career scoring record with 302 points (2017–20), as well as the single-season record with 90 (2019). Jesse Hubbard holds the career record for goals scored with 163 (1995–98), while Gavin McBride holds the single season record with 54 (2015). Sowers also holds the career assists record with 181, and the single-season record with 56 (2018). Scott Bacigalupo holds the career saves record with 732 (1991–94), while William Cronin holds the single-season record with 277 (1973).\nMatt Bailer holds the NCAA Division I record for face-off percentage as one of nine players to have won all of his face-offs in a game where he participated in 10 or more (12 face-offs, 4/15/00, vs. Harvard). No other Tigers currently hold records, but Trevor Tierney formerly held the single-season goals against average (2001–2006, 5.70) and career goals against average (2001–2006, 6.65) NCAA records, while Kevin Gray held the career saves per game record (1977–1994, 15.64) and William Cronin held the career saves per game (1974–1977, 14.43) record.\nNumerous Tiger lacrosse players have been NCAA national statistical champions. Ryan Boyle leads the way as a former champion in several statistics: points per game (2003, 4.54), assists per game (2003, 3.77), assists per game (2004, 2.93), assists (2003, 49), assists (2004, 44). Trevor Tierney was twice a national statistical champion: goals against average (2001, 5.70) and save percentage (2001, .671). Additionally, Jon Hess (assists per game, 1998, 2.60), Patrick Cairns (goals against average, 1997, 6.44) and Corey Popham (goals against average, 1999, 7.07) have been national statistical champions.\nThe team has also led the nation on several occasions, including the following: scoring defense (1997, 6.87; 1998, 7.60; 1999, 7.15; 2001, 5.80; 2007, 6.21), scoring margin (1996, 8.27; 1998, 6.87) and winning percentage (1997, 15–0 – 1.000, 1998, 14–1 – .933, 2001, 14–1 – .933). The Princeton teams of the late 1990s were second only to the Cornell teams of the 1970s in terms of consecutive victories: consecutive victories: (3/16/96-3/7/98, 29, Cornell-42) and consecutive conference victories: (4/29/95-3/30/02, 37, Cornell-39).\nIn addition to national records, Princeton holds the following Ivy League records based on conference play. Ryan Boyle holds several individual conference records: single-season assists (32, 2003), career assists (86, 2001–04) and career points (120, 2001–04). The team holds conference records for single-game goals allowed (1, vs Penn, 1970) and single-season goals allowed (12, 1957).\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Princeton's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\n† NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus.\n†† Ivy League cancelled 2021 collegiate season due to the COVID-19 virus."

        "title": "Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse",
        "text": "The Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse team represents the University of Virginia in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's lacrosse. The Cavaliers compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and plays home games at Klöckner Stadium, or occasionally Turf Field or Scott Stadium, in Charlottesville, Virginia. The team is coached by Lars Tiffany, who led the team to back-to-back national titles in the 2019 NCAA Lacrosse Championship and 2021 NCAA Lacrosse Championship (the 2020 tournament being canceled due to COVID-19).\nWinning seven NCAA Championships and nine national titles overall, Virginia is one of the all-time great collegiate lacrosse programs. Virginia's 2006 team was one of the greatest in the history of the sport, finishing 17–0 out of a very competitive ACC, and winning 16 of its 17 games by four or more goals. Each former Virginia head coach in the NCAA era of men's lacrosse (Dom Starsia, \"Ace\" Adams, and Glenn Thiel) is among the top 25 of all-time lacrosse coaching wins. Both Tiffany and Starsia coincidentally moved into the Virginia position after they first achieved success as head coaches at their \"alma mater\" Brown University.\nVirginia's historic rivalries have extended to the championship matches of six different NCAA Tournaments, with the Cavaliers winning five of those six—defeating Syracuse in 1999, defeating Maryland in 2011 and in 2021, and defeating Johns Hopkins in 1972 and in 2003—while losing just one, in double-overtime, to Hopkins in 1980.\nHistory.\nUniversity records show that Virginia fielded lacrosse teams from 1904 to 1907, although no further information from that period is available. After a hiatus, lacrosse returned to Charlottesville in 1925 though the team struggled in the ensuing years. Through 1932, the Cavaliers won only one game, while they lost 30 and tied four. Virginia along with Duke, UNC, and Washington &amp; Lee played in the Dixie Lacrosse League from 1938 to 1942 with the Cavaliers winning the championship in the inaugural season. The team was disbanded after the 1932 season and would play sporadically until lacrosse returned for good in 1947. Two years later, Virginia won more games than it lost for the first time in school history when it posted a 7–4 record. The Cavaliers then posted an 8–3 mark in 1950 and 7–2 in 1951. The following season, they recorded an identical tally and the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) named Virginia the 1952 co-national champions.\nIn 1970, Virginia finished the season with an 8–2 record and the USILA again awarded them as co-champions with Navy and Johns Hopkins. The following season, the NCAA instituted a single-elimination tournament to determine the national championship, and the Cavaliers made an appearance but were eliminated by Navy in the first round. In 1972, Virginia again secured a tournament berth, and beat in succession Army, Cortland State, and Johns Hopkins for their first NCAA national championship. In 1978, former Army coach Jim \"Ace\" Adams took over as head coach, and from that season onward, Virginia has been a regular participant in the NCAA tournament. Since then, the Cavaliers have never failed to qualify in two consecutive seasons. Virginia advanced to the championship game in 1980, 1986, 1994, and 1996, each time falling to the eventual champion by one goal. In 1993, Dom Starsia became head coach, leading the Cavaliers to national titles in 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2011. Since the establishment of an ACC tournament in 1989, Virginia has won the regular-season championship ten times, more than any of the other three teams in the league.\nVirginia's 2006 season was remarkable as the Cavaliers became the first team in NCAA history to finish the season with a 17–0 record en route to the program's third national championship in eight years. The team won its games by an average of more than eight goals per game and drew comparisons to some of the best lacrosse teams of all time. The Virginia offense led the nation in scoring (15.28), while the defense ranked 10th, allowing fewer than eight goals per game. Eight Cavaliers were named All-Americans, the most in program history, and senior attackman Matt Ward received the Tewaaraton Trophy as the best player in the nation.\nIn 2011, the Cavaliers posted a 9–5 regular-season record before entering the NCAA tournament, where they defeated Bucknell, Cornell, Denver, and finally Maryland 9–7 to win their fifth NCAA championship. During the tournament, head coach Dom Starsia became the all-time wins leader in Division I men's lacrosse history, breaking Jack Emmer's previous mark of 326 wins. Five Cavaliers were named USILA All-Americans. Following the tournament, third-year attackman Steele Stanwick won the Tewaaraton Trophy as the nation's top player. Starsia left the program at the conclusion of the 2016 season after a poor run of four seasons that included two losing records – only the program's third and fourth since the NCAA championship era began in 1971.\nBrown head coach Lars Tiffany, who had played for Starsia at the college, was named as his replacement on June 21, 2016. In his third season, Tiffany led the Cavaliers to an 17–3 season record, an ACC championship, and back to the 2019 National Championship Game where they defeated Yale, 13–9, to claim their eighth title. After the 2020 season was cancelled due to COVID-19, Tiffany led the 2021 team to a 14–4 season record and the 2021 National Championship Game where they defeated Maryland, 17–16, to retain their title.\nRivalries.\nVirginia–Syracuse has been an extremely evenly matched series between two lacrosse titans. Virginia has gained the upper hand in the Johns Hopkins and Maryland rivalries since the 1980s and 1990s, but trails in those all-time series (especially to Johns Hopkins) as a \"late blooming\" national power.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Virginia's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:"

        "title": "2009 World Series of Poker results",
        "text": "The 2009 World Series of Poker was the 40th annual World Series of Poker (WSOP). Held in Las Vegas at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, the 2009 series began on May 27 and featured 57 poker championships in several variants. All events but the $10,000 World Championship No Limit Texas hold 'em Main Event, the most prestigious of the WSOP events, ended by July 15. The final table of the Main Event, known as the November Nine, was suspended until November, to allow for better television coverage. Following the WSOP custom since 1976, each of the event winners received a championship bracelet in addition to that event's prize money, which this year ranged from US$87,778 for the $500 Casino Employees No-Limit Hold'em to US$8,546,435 for the Main Event.\nWSOP game variants.\nMost of the tournaments played at the WSOP are variants of Texas Hold 'em. Hold 'em is a community card game where each player may use any combination of the five community cards and the player's own two hole cards to make a poker hand, in contrast to poker variants such as stud or draw in which each player holds a separate individual hand. Between 2000 and 2009, hold'em surpassed seven-card stud as the most common game in U.S. casinos. Seven-card stud is a poker variant wherein each player is dealt two hole cards and one face-up to start the hand, followed by three more face-up cards one at a time, and then another hidden card, with betting after each round. Another poker variant played is Omaha, a game in which each player is dealt four hole cards and must use exactly two of them in conjunction with three community cards to make the best possible five-card hand. Other games played at the 2008 tournament included Razz, HORSE, and Deuce-to-Seven.\nWithin each of these poker variants a myriad of options exist. For example, depending on the betting structure, a tournament might be described as no limit, limit or pot-limit. Games may also include other variations on the rules governing the execution of the specific game such as shootout, eight or better, or heads up.\n2009 highlights.\nThere were 57 events, two more than in 2008. The main event had 6,494 buy-ins, 350 fewer than the previous year. Other changes for 2009 include the elimination of rebuy events and the introduction of triple starting chips.\nIn recognition that 2009 was the 40th WSOP, the tournament started with a special $40,000 No-Limit event. As one of the most expensive poker tournaments ever, the event attracted what considered to be one of the toughest poker fields ever assembled. Poker pro, Vitaly Lunkin, won his second bracelet in this event. Lunkin then finished in second place at the $10,000 pot-limit Omaha event and the $50,000 HORSE Championship, finishing the summer with over $2.7 million. David Bach, a player with several final table appearances, won his first bracelet in the $50,000 HORSE Championship. At 18 hours and 44 minutes the final table of the $50K HORSE event was the second longest final table in WSOP history.\nJeff Lisandro became the fifth player to ever win three bracelets in the same year, and the first ever to win bracelets in all three stud variants offered at the WSOP (stud high-only, stud high-low, and Razz) in the same year. Poker superstar Barry Greenstein, said that \"A lot of people might have said before this year, we may not ever see another guy win three bracelets because the fields are so big... Lisandro proved them wrong.\" He was the first player to do so since Phil Ivey did it in 2002. By winning two bracelets, Ivey, considered by many to be the best overall poker player in the world, became the youngest player to ever amass seven WSOP bracelets. The milestone means he is tied with Poker Hall of Famer Billy Baxter at sixth place on the most bracelets list.\nDue to capacity limitations, the 2009 WSOP turned away over 500 players from the Main Event. Patrik Antonius, T. J. Cloutier, Layne Flack, Ted Forrest, Brandon Adams, Richard Ashby, and Mickey Appleman were among the notable players turned away from the Main Event. 1996 WSOP champion Huck Seed would have been included in that list, if he had not won the National Heads-Up Poker Championship which meant he was guaranteed entry into the 2009 WSOP Main Event.\nAnother tournament which met its capacity limits was the \"$1,000 buy-in Stimulus Special.\" This event set a new record for a non-main event tournament with 6,012 participants.\nReferences.\nThe $7.7 million prize pool was the largest non-main event prize pool in WSOP history.\nThe 918 players set a record turnout for an Omaha event at the WSOP.\nEvent 5 was originally scheduled to end on June 2, but because of the size of the field the tournament was extended a day.\nEvent 4 had the lowest buy-in of all the open events since the 2006 WSOP. Dubbed the \"$1,000 buy-in Stimulus Special,\" it set a new record for a non-main event tournament with 6,012 participants. This number would have been larger, but the tournament was capped at 6,012 players.\nLike all the Pot Limit Omaha events, event 52 was a \"Triple Chance\" event. In these events players had access to three equal units of chips. For example, in a $2500 event, players have access to a total of 7500 in chips, but they had to option to start with either 2500, 5000 or all 7500. If they started with 2500, and lost those chips, they could access another 2500 or their remaining 5000. They were not eliminated until they had lost all 7500 of their possible starting chips. Thus the event was not a rebuy event(There were no rebuy events in 2009 WSOP.), but rather one where players could lose all their chips during the first three rounds but not be eliminated until they lost all 7500 chips. If a player started with less than the full 7500, at the end of three rounds any remaining available 2500 units were added to the player's stacks, and anyone losing all their chips after that point would be eliminated.\nThe final table of the Main Event is now known as the November Nine as the nine players have to wait until November to determine who the champion is."

He was one of the most popular players on the Canton Professionals, the pre-National Football League version of the Canton Bulldogs who played in the Ohio League. The team's center, Turner played with the Pros from around 1911 until his death in 1914.\nCanton Professionals.\nBy 1911 Turner became the captain of the Professionals. At this time a rivalry existed between the team and Peggy Parratt, the captain of Shelby Blues. Parratt, prior to joining Shelby Blues, was the captain of the hated Massillon Tigers, the top rival for Canton.\nDuring a game in 1911, Turner pulled his entire team from the field to protest a referee's call in favor of the Shelby blues. In a post-game statement, Turner told the \"Canton Repository\" on November 26, 1911, \"Right or wrong, no more football for me after this; these old football duds, mud and dirt, go up to the attic to rot ... I'm done!\"\nDeath.\nNonetheless, Turner returned to the gridiron for the next three seasons. He continued to play for the Pros and kept up the rivalry with Parratt. However, tragedy struck near the end of the 1914 season when Turner was severely injured during a game against Parratt and the Akron Indians. While making a tackle on Akron's Joe Collins, Turner's back was fractured and his spinal cord was completely severed. According to Canton manager Jack Cusack, who was at Turner's bedside when he died, his last words were \"I know I must go,\" he said, \"but I'm satisfied, for we beat Peggy Parratt.\" Canton won the game 6–0.\nThe death of Turner was taken hard by the team. It was the first fatal accident involving a major professional football team in Ohio. The Professionals easily lost a rematch to the Indians a few days later."

The Illinois Fighting Illini finished the season with a record of 17 wins and 1 loss. The season was cut short as three of the five starters headed off to active duty in the armed forces. Illinois won the Big Ten Conference Title and had finished the regular season as the nations' top ranked team. Paced by a group of players known as the Whiz Kids, the team consisted of 20-year-old All-America forward Andy Phillip and teenagers Ken Menke, Gene Vance, Jack Smiley and team captain Art Mathisen. These players were so dominant in the Big Ten, that only Northwestern's Otto Graham could crack the all-conference team.\nThe Army drafted Mathisen, Menke and Smiley. That left only Vance and Phillip, both good enough to be selected to Illinois' All-Century team. Head coach Doug Mills made a decision in February 1943 that all five always supported, the club did not participate in either the NCAA or NIT tournament. Wyoming's NCAA championship that season may not have happened had Illinois’ season not coincided with World War II. The team was retroactively named the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nFour of the five, minus Mathisen, returned to Illinois and tried to recapture the glory for one more season in 1946–47 after the war ended, but the chemistry had changed as well as their talent. Illinois went 14–6.\nThe final living Whiz Kid, Gene Vance, died in 2012.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season"

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between Australia and South Africa",
        "text": " \nThe contest between The Wallabies and The Springboks is one of the major rivalries in rugby union. Since 2000s, the two teams have competed for the Mandela Challenge Plate.\nThe teams' first meeting was on 8 July 1933 at Newlands in Cape Town in the first of 5 tests on the 1933 Wallabies tour. The test was won 17–3 by South Africa who also won that first series 3–2.\nSouth Africa has a 53.8% winning record against Australia, and before the era of sporting boycotts, dominated the early encounters up to 1971.\nBoth sides have exhibited a considerable home advantage, with the Springboks winning more than 75% of matches played in South Africa, and the Wallabies winning more than 60% of matches played in Australia.\nIn the amateur era, the Springboks made five tours to Australia, and were undefeated in three of them. South Africa won three of the five test series they played in Australia; 2–0 in 1937, 2-0 in 1956 and 3–0 in 1971. By contrast, the Wallabies made six tours to South Africa, only once making it through undefeated, albeit on a tour comprising only four matches and one test in 1992. Prior to that, Australia's best away tour was the 2-all drawn test series of 1963.\nPrior to 1972, South African teams were racially selected, organised by the whites-only South African Rugby Board. Australia then supported the international boycott of sporting contacts with South Africa over the issue of apartheid. The teams did not meet again until 1992, when apartheid was being dismantled and the SARB had merged with the non-racial South African Rugby Union. Since that time Australia has won just over 50% of their games and has won the Mandela Plate nine times in the twelve years since its inception.\nIn the professional era, extended tours of each country have been replaced by participation in an annual series involving the top teams of the Southern Hemisphere. From 1996 through 2011, Australia and South Africa competed alongside New Zealand in the Tri Nations series. Starting in 2012, the three nations competed alongside Argentina in The Rugby Championship. In the Tri Nations era, the Wallabies and Springboks played two or three encounters each year on a home-and-away basis; the Rugby Championship features two annual encounters, also on a home-and-away basis.\nRugby World Cup.\nAustralia and South Africa have met three times in the Rugby World Cup. In 1995 they were drawn in the same pool and host nation South Africa won 27–18, going on to win the cup. In 1999 Australia knocked South Africa out of the competition in a semi-final at Twickenham, winning 27–21, after extra-time. In 2011, Australia again knocked South Africa out of the competition, in a quarter-final at Westpac Stadium in Wellington, winning 11–9.\nXV results.\nBelow is a list of matches that Australia has retrospectively awarded matches test match status by virtue of awarding caps, but South Africa did not award caps."

Mike's brother, Larry Corcoran, was also a Chicago White Stockings pitcher, and was Mike's teammate in 1884.\nMike played semi-pro baseball in New England in 1883, and participated in spring training with the New York Metropolitans of the American Association but did not make the team. He started one game for the White Stockings on July 15, 1884, in a game against the Detroit Wolverines at Recreation Park. He pitched all 9 innings for a complete game but gave up 16 hits and 14 runs, 4 of which were earned, and was charged with the loss in a 14–0 defeat. He also struck out 2 batters. The \"Inter Ocean\" wrote that \"The Chicagos, thinking they could win with any pitcher, presented a brother of Larry Corcoran’s and the home team made him think he had better sign with amateurs.\" The \"Detroit Free Press\" said that \"There is a strong resemblance between the brothers in feature, stature and action, but not in effectiveness.\" According to the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", after the game Corcoran \"went home satisfied that he is not a pitcher.\" Larry Corcoran pitched both the game before and the game after Mike Corcoran's start, giving the Corcoran brothers three consecutive starts.\nIn 1885 Corcoran played in the Colorado State League, with records of him playing for at least 3 teams in the league – the Leadville Blues, Pueblo Ponies and Denver Solis. When not playing baseball Corcoran worked as a carpenter. He died in 1927 from a heart disease."

Today, three Queensland clubs participate in the national competition while two formerly did so.\nThe team was announced at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre on 10 June 2008, ahead of the second State of Origin game in Brisbane. The players eligible for the team are players originally from Queensland and even though some players went to New South Wales and played for them under residential selection rules, these players could be chosen under their place of origin. The team was picked by a team of six judges in 2008 from a list of 100 nominated players. The judges were former administrator Kevin Brasch, former Queensland halfback Cyril Connell, writer Ian Heads, historian Professor Max Howell, commentator John McCoy and historian Greg Shannon."

        "text": "Resovia, officially known for sponsorship reasons as Asseco Resovia, is a professional men's volleyball club based in Rzeszów in southeastern Poland, founded in 1937. They compete in the Polish PlusLiga. \nThe club has won seven Polish Champion titles and three national cups. They won four league titles in the 1970s and the first title in the 21st century in 2012, which put an end to Skra Bełchatów's dominance in the PlusLiga which lasted for 7 consecutive seasons.\nClub history.\nResovia was established in 1937 in the city of Rzeszów. In 2006, Asseco became the main sponsor of the club. The name \"Resovia\" is derived from the Latin, meaning Rzeszów, what has been confirmed by the city council in 2013. In 1969, the club was promoted to the 1st Polish Volleyball League, the highest level volleyball league, playing there until 1991.\nThe 1970s were the most successful in the club's long history. During that time Resovia led by Jan Strzelczyk and Władyslaw Pałaszewski achieved its biggest successes, winning four Polish Championships (1971, 1972, 1974, 1975), one Polish Cup (1975), and a silver medal of the 1972–73 CEV European Champions Cup. The team of that time consisted of such players like Bronisław Bebel, Stanisław Gościniak, Marek Karbarz or Włodzimierz Stefański who played a major role in the Polish national volleyball team, leading Poland to the titles of 1976 Olympic Champions and 1974 World Champions. In the next years, the club also managed to win 2 Polish Cups in 1983 and 1987 before being relegated in 1991.\nAfter being relegated in 1991, the club spent over a decade in the 2nd Polish Volleyball League. In 2004, the team led by a former Resovia player – Jan Such, was promoted to the newly created professional volleyball league (official name since 2008: PlusLiga). Its first season in the top league Resovia ended in 7th place, achieving higher positions in the next years. In 2006, due to sponsorship reasons, the club changed its name to Asseco Resovia. During the 2007–08 season, Resovia, led by Andrzej Kowal, took part in the CEV Challenge Cup, losing both, the semifinal to Modena Volley (2–3), and a match for third place to the French team, Stade Poitevin Poitiers (0–3). Eventually, the 2008–09 PlusLiga season, Resovia finished in 2nd place (first medal after 20 years), and gained the right to play in the next CEV Champions League edition where they lost a two–game playoffs to Trentino BetClic (0–3, 1–3), the future competition champion. The 2009–10 PlusLiga season, Resovia finished in 3rd place. \nIn the 2010–11 PlusLiga season, Resovia reached the semifinals of the 2010–11 CEV Cup and lost a two–legged tie to the Italian team, Sisley Treviso (2–3, 1–3). The 2010–11 PlusLiga season Resovia for the second time in a row ended in 3rd place. After the season Ljubomir Travica left the club and a Polish coach Andrzej Kowal took over the team for the next 6 seasons. The next year due to the 3rd place last PlusLiga season Resovia once again spent playing in the CEV Cup, but for this time managed to reach the final and after tough fighting against Russian team Dynamo Moscow (2–3, 2–3) lost and was awarded with the silver medals. On the other hand, after 7 years of the PGE Skra Bełchatów dominance in the Polish league Resovia achieved its 5th title of the Polish Champion beating Skra in four matches (3–1) (first title after 37 years).\nIn the 2012–13 PlusLiga season, Resovia as a reigning Polish Champion was once again granted the right to compete in the upcoming 2012–13 CEV Champions League edition. The club ended in 2nd place in the league round and was eventually stopped by Italian team Lube Banca Marche Macerata in the Playoff 12 (0–3, 1–3). However, Resovia ended the season with another, 6th title of the Polish Champion beating ZAKSA Kędzierzyn-Koźle after five matches (3–2). In the next 2013–14 CEV Champions League edition, after achieving first place in the league round and beating Belgian team Knack Roeselare in the playoff stage Resovia has been defeated by another Polish club in the competition – Jastrzębski Węgiel (0–3, 1–3). In the domestic competition PGE Skra Bełchatów regained the Polish Champion title, defeating Resovia in 3 matches (3–0).\nDuring the 2014–15 PlusLiga season, Resovia was competing in the 2014–15 CEV Champions League. The club beat Russian club Lokomotiv Novosibirsk (3–1) and lost in revenge match in Rzeszów (2–3) on 11 March 2015. Resovia reached the Final Four, which was held in Berlin, Germany and played with another Polish team – PGE Skra Bełchatów and for the first time in competition's history two Polish teams played in the semifinal of the CEV Champions League. On 28 March 2015 Resovia beat PGE Skra Bełchatów in the semifinal (3–0) and eventually lost in final to Zenit Kazan (0–3). On 28 April 2015 Resovia won its 7th title of the Polish Champion.\nOn 16–17 April 2016, Resovia was a host of the 2015–16 CEV Champions League Final Four held in Tauron Arena Kraków. The team lost the semifinal to Zenit Kazan (1–3), and a match for third place to Cucine Lube Civitanova (2–3), and ended the tournament in 4th place. Russell Holmes received an individual award for the \"Best Middle Blocker\" of the tournament. During the 2015–16 PlusLiga season, Resovia took second place in the regular season because of the better set ratio than PGE Skra Bełchatów (Skra lost one more set than Resovia). In the final, ZAKSA Kędzierzyn-Koźle beat Resovia in three matches (0–3).\nSince 2016, the club failed to achieve any significant success ending the 2016–17 PlusLiga season in 4th place and losing the quarterfinal of the Polish Cup to Lotos Trefl Gdańsk. In the 2016–17 CEV Champions League season, the team ended in 3rd place in the league round, and as one of the three third–placed teams was promoted to the next stage. Resovia was not able to defeat Italian team Modena Volley and has been eliminated in the Playoff 12 (2–3, 1–3). By the end of the 2016–17 PlusLiga season, Andrzej Kowal announced his departure as the Resovia head coach. Roberto Serniotti was announced as the new Resovia head coach on 11 May 2017.\nAfter achieving 4th place in the previous PlusLiga season, Resovia took part in the 2017–18 CEV Cup reaching the semifinals and eventually losing to Russian team Belogorie Belgorod (0–3, 0–3). In the domestic league, Resovia achieved 6th place, losing in three matches (1–2) of the first round of the playoffs to Indykpol AZS Olsztyn. On 3 December 2017, an Italian expert Roberto Serniotti was dismissed as a head coach after spending only a few months in the club. He has been replaced by Andrzej Kowal who returned to his post after a short break. \nAt the beginning of the 2018–19 PlusLiga season, Resovia lost 4 matches in a row what resulted in dismissal of both Andrzej Kowal, and the club's chairman – Bartosz Górski. The club decided to employ a Romanian expert Gheorghe Crețu and a former Resovia player – Krzysztof Ignaczak as the club's new chairman. Nevertheless, the team did not manage to qualify to the playoff stage and eventually ended the season in 7th place. In the same season, Resovia took part in the 2018 Club World Championship held in Poland, surprisingly defeating the Brazilian team Sada Cruzeiro in the preliminary round and qualifying to the semifinals. In the semifinals, the team from Rzeszów has been defeated by Italian team Cucine Lube Civitanova in 4 sets (1–3) and ended the tournament in 4th place losing also a match for third place to the Russian team Fakel Novy Urengoy (1–3). The contract with Gheorghe Crețu was not renewed, and on 9 May 2020 Piotr Gruszka was announced as the new Resovia head coach. \nThe 2019–20 PlusLiga season can be named the worst in club's modern history. The team, led by Piotr Gruszka (dismissed on 30 January 2020), and Italian coach Emanuele Zanini (since 11 February 2020) ended the season in 13th place, winning only 7 out of 24 matches and barely avoiding relegation. Krzysztof Ignaczak resigned his post as the club's chairman on 14 February 2020, and has been replaced by Piotr Maciąg. Emanuele Zanini remained the head coach of Resovia until the end of the season. On 8 April 2020, an Italian expert Alberto Giuliani was announced as the new Resovia head coach.\nTeam.\n\"As of 2023–24 season\""

However, amongst the Nordic countries, it is by no means the weakest, Norway is good against smaller teams but is not very good under pressure but they still play well. \nas it is a more recent introduction to Finland, and has no presence in the other three nations. A major problem though, is the climate, which means that many pitches may be under snow for large parts of the year. Serious interest in the game began in the 1960s.\nFor many years, Oslo RFC was the most northerly rugby club in the world. Stavanger Rugby Club was formed in 1978 and played Oslo in the Autumn of that year, presenting Oslo with a trophy, a rock bit, in 1979, a return match was played in Stavanger; Oslo won both matches.. During the mid-1980s, Oslo RFC's nearest opposition in Norway was Stavanger, a round trip of 685 miles. Their nearest club was Karlstad RFC in \"Sweden\" a round trip of 310 miles.\nRugby has a much longer standing in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark, \nwhich have a combined figure of around 10,000 registered players, and it has been introduced there. Rugby union is also played in neighbouring\nShetland, and visitors from there have toured Norway, including people from the British military bases and ships there.\nNorway played its first international against Latvia who beat them 44–6. At the time, the Welsh fly-half Huw Howells was the driving force in trying to promote the game."

The Swedish Rugby Union ( was founded in 1932, and joined the IRB in 1988.\nHistory.\n\"Swedish football\" in the nineteenth century was a variant of association football with some rugby elements. By 1900, Swedish football clubs were using the Football Association's rules, with no rugby influence.\nThe pure form of rugby was introduced between the wars. The visiting cruisers of the British Royal Navy, and played the first recorded match in Stockholm The sport became well established in this period thanks also to the efforts of Yves Gylden, who had learnt the game in France, and founded the first three Swedish clubs in Stockholm.\nAs with many other countries in Europe, the Second World War nearly finished off the game. Sweden was neutral in this conflict, meaning that the game did not suffer the war casualties that it did in other countries. By 1960, the number of active clubs had declined to fewer than ten. This was remedied in the 60s and 70s by an intensive development programme, which helped to bring that figure up to at least 55 clubs in the mid 90s.\nA persistent problem for Swedish rugby has been the climate, which means that many pitches may be under snow for large parts of the year. For this reason rugby is a summer sport in Sweden, the season running from late April to the middle of October.\nNotable players include:\nClub Rugby.\nThe Allsvenskan is the highest tier of the national rugby union competition in Sweden. The first Swedish championship took place in 1943 and the current champions (2016) is Stockholm Exiles. Under the Allsvenskan is two levels of regional competition.\nNew for the 2010 season is a national rugby sevens series that will be played over multiple weekends. This initiative comes from the decision by the IOC to include rugby sevens in the Olympics.\nThe Swedish club champions also compete for the Nordic Cup with fellow club champions of Denmark, Finland and Norway."

The Poland women's rugby sevens team won the silver medal at the 2023 European Games behind Great Britain, progressing to the final 2024 Summer Olympic qualification tournament.\nGoverning body.\nPolish Rugby Union (Polski Związek Rugby) was founded in 1957, and joined the International Rugby Football Board in 1988. The official supplier of equipment to the PRU is the Polish company \"Gonga\".\nAn earlier Polish Rugby Union was set up in the early 1920s, but was disbanded in 1928.\nHistory.\nIn 1921, Louis Amblard, a Frenchman, set up the very first Polish rugby club called \"White Eagles\" (\"Białe Orły\"). The first match was in 1922, and the first club international in 1924 against a Romanian side.\nThe game became established in the Warsaw Military Academy in the early 1930s.\nThe tragic events of World War II and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact meant that the growth of Polish rugby was retarded until the 1950s. During World War II, there were occasional games between allied POWs in German camps in Poland. For example, a game was held between a Scottish and a Welsh XV, in ten inches of snow. No conversions were allowed, as the ball would have gone over the camp fence, and the game was twenty minutes each way. Players wore army boots, trousers, prison shirts and balaclavas.\nPolish rugby arguably achieved its greatest success in the late 1970s when the national team beat Italy, Spain and the USSR, and also held Romania to a 37–21 win in 1977.\nIn 1983, Poland failed to play in the FIRA Championships, and told FIRA that two of their players had died. It is not known where the other died, but one had died near Bucharest.\nThe Cold War frequently intruded – for example in the 1984 FIRA Championships, in the game against France, Poland demanded the removal of the French players Didier Camberabero, Henri Sanz and the Brive RFC centre Yves Fouget, because as members of the French armed forces, they were considered to be a security risk.\nBecause of high Polish emigration, particularly to France, and English speaking nations, the Polish team actually has a fairly large pool of potential players. In addition, a number of Poles returning from jobs in the British Isles and France, have carried the game back with them.\nThere are currently three divisions in Poland. The second division was relaunched in 2009 using some of the major teams providing 2nd XVs, along with some newly formed sides. The top division has 8 teams while the second division has 6 teams. Prior to that in 2008/2009 there were 10 teams in the top division and only 4 in the second. This led to some very uneven contests between the top teams and those at the bottom of the league. There is now also a regional league played in the centre of Poland (around Lodz and Warsaw) in which some smaller clubs have entered teams and second teams from some of the top clubs nationally compete.\nPolish rugby development, however, has tended to concentrate on rugby sevens as a means of introducing the sport to people. The PRU organises regular one day sevens tournaments over the spring/summer with teams travelling from all over the country. There are teams forming all over the country, but there is a shortage of quality coaching and basic equipment. Despite this rugby is making good headway.\nRugby tens also has some popularity in Poland.\nNational team.\nPoland's international debut was in 1958 against , and they won the match, 9–8.\nThey compete in the second division competition Rugby Europe Trophy, where the winner is promoted to the Premier Division Rugby Europe Championship. In 2018, Poland competed against Portugal, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Maldova.\nIn 2018, the Polish XV Men's team was ranked 35 in the world. They also compete in the VII's Europe Grand Prix 7s Series.\nWomen's Polish Rugby compete in the Women's 7s GPS, where they play other European countries, such as Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Italy, France, Russia and Germany\nNotable players.\nIn the 1990s, there were at least fifty Poles playing in the French first and second divisions. Notable amongst these was Grzegorz Kacala, the open side flanker, who helped Brive win the 1996 European Cup.\nMariusz Pudzianowski, better known as a Polish strongman, is one of the most famous Polish rugby players. He played with Budowlani Lodz but retired after one season.\nMen's rugby.\nXV Rugby.\nEkstraliga.\nRugby Ekstraliga\nTeams \nLiga I.\nTeams\nLiga II.\nII liga Rugby Teams\nSeven's Rugby.\nTeams.\nWomen's rugby.\nAlthough Poland's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2005.

Most national players play in lower division teams in France (even in second/third teams) while some national players play in the domestic league. The main teams are based in the three main conurbations of Tricity, in Warsaw and Łódź (the latter, being current national champions). In Poland, because rugby union is viewed as a \"power sport\", flamboyance is not encouraged. The lack of foreign coaches stifles development, which is reflected by the national team's performances in the European Nations Cup against nations with less financial muscle and a smaller player pool such as the and the , as well as matches against , and ."

        "text": "Rugby union in Switzerland is a minor but growing sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe Swiss Rugby Federation was founded in 1972 and joined the IRFB in 1988.\nHistory.\nLike neighbouring Germany, Austria and France, Swiss rugby is actually amongst the oldest in the world. The earliest recorded match in Switzerland was in 1869, and Lausanne RFC can claim to be as old as Blackheath.\nHowever, Swiss rugby continued at a very low key for over a hundred years. The World Wars and other global upheavals hindered the game, and it was really the presence of a number of ex-patriates working in the banking industry, or as tax exiles, who helped keep the game going.\nIn 1974, a side from Basel toured France and were on the end of record breaking defeats. They lost 127-0 to Grenoble, 104-3 to Thonon and 116-0 to Annecy. The captain of the Basel team, Pierre Langlois said, \"We conceded 73 tries, I think. We even had a penalty try given against us when we were losing by 100 points.\"\nSwiss rugby continued in a haphazard manner during the 1970s and 80s, for example, when was due to play Bellinzona RFC in Italy, two of their players were delayed by a landslide. In order to make up numbers, a journalist and their coach driver were added to the squad. They did so well in the game that they were invited to subsequent training sessions.\nThe Swiss Federation undertook an intensive development program in the 1980s, under Evelyne Oberson, and managed to gain a number of new native players. Ms Oberson, working often alone in Lausanne as a volunteer, was in every way a key element to Swiss rugby as, through her high level of personal organisation and admin skills, for the most part managed the (then) small Federation almost single-handedly. She was essential to Swiss rugby holding together from the 80s until its current format.\nIn 1989, Chris Thau claimed that Switzerland had around 1,000 players (a number which has increased somewhat since then).\nThere are at least thirty Swiss clubs at present.\nSwiss rugby is now dominated by home grown players, and for some the bright lights of French and Italian rugby might be a draw.\nMore recently, 2006-07 Heineken Cup clash between the French side Bourgoin and Irish rugby's Munster was moved from Bourgoin's home ground, to the Stade de Genève (Geneva Stadium). The stadium's capacity is 30,000, and attendance on the day was 16,255.\nNotable Swiss players include:"

They are currently ranked 61st, and have 3040 registered players.\nGoverning body.\nThe Taiwanese Rugby Union was founded in 1946, and joined the IRFB in 1986. Concerning its foundation, the efforts of Ke Zhi-Zhang (a.k.a. Ka Shi-Sho:柯子彰 in Japan) cannot be overlooked.\nHistory.\nRugby in Taiwan goes back to the turn of the 20th century, when the island was known as \"Formosa\". It has been claimed that it was being played even earlier by European sailors (as in Mainland China, and Japan).\nUnlike the PRC, rugby union has an unbroken history in Taiwan, but the Chinese Civil War and souring of relations with the mainland has meant it was effectively cut off.\nThe game has a long presence in this part of Asia, especially Japan and Hong Kong. Rugby was also played in Shanghai at an early date, and is played to a high degree in South Korea. Right now, Taiwan is no. 4 in Asia, behind Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.\nNot unlike South Korea, Taiwanese rugby has grown with the local economy, and has been tied up with corporate interests. Growing economic links with Japan, a major rugby playing nation, have helped the game in Taiwan from the 1960s to the present. Another thing that Taiwan has in common with South Korea is that it has always performed better at rugby sevens than the fifteen a side game.\nDuring the 70s and 80s, Taiwanese rugby underwent a big development programme, addressing issues such as the shortage of pitches. However, Taiwanese rugby is not short of other resources, and administrators such as Lin Chang Tang have been a great boon.\nTraditionally, Taiwan has suffered from a shortage of pitches. Taiwan is considered to be the fourth rugby nation of East Asia, after Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong respectively, although developments in the PRC and Malaysia may change that position.\nNotable Taiwanese players include -\nThe Chinese Question.\nBecause Taiwan's relationship with the People's Republic of China is an incredibly complex one, it competes under the name \"Chung Hua Taipei\" or \"Chinese Taipei\", rather than as either Taiwan or the Republic of China.\nBecause of political issues, with some commentators trying to work out how the entry of the PRC into international rugby would affect Taiwan's position. When the PRC joined the UN, it resulted in the expulsion of Taiwan."

Thus Thai rugby is not a legacy of colonialism.\nSome of the Thai middle class took up the sport in the 1920s, along with ex-patriates from French and English speaking countries.\nThe Second World War interrupted the development of the sport, but its adoption by the Thai military and police ensured its survival.\nThai rugby still has a strong ex-pat connection; one of the most famous players for Thailand is best known for being Will Carling's brother. The Southerners Sports Club (Bangkok), and the Old Bangkok Bangers Rugby Club are Thailand's main ex-pat rugby clubs, fielding sides in the local Thailand Rugby Union competition, and in local and international 7s and 10s tournaments.\nThere are now at least fifty clubs in Thailand.\nNational team.\nThailand has a national sevens team.

        "text": "Rugby union in Zambia is a minor but growing sport. The Zambia national rugby union team is currently ranked 67th by World Rugby. The Zambia Rugby Football Union has 9880 registered players and three formally organised clubs.\nThe governing body is the Zambia Rugby Football Union, which was founded in 1965, and affiliated to the IRFB in 1995.\nHistory.\nNot unlike other neighbouring African countries, Zambian rugby has been a legacy of British colonialism. Traditionally rugby in Zambia was seen as an expatriate sport, however, over the last 20 years it has become a truly Zambian sport with the majority of its players coming up through the schools and local club system.\nFifteens (XVs) rugby in Zambia is played at a basic level compared to the major rugby playing nations.\nZambia has over the last seven years built its own highly respected 7s tournament in the form of the Lusaka Mosi International Sevens. Past winners include the Springbok under-23s and the British Army. Zambia has beaten a number of South African Super 14 teams who have participated.\nIt should be remembered that Northern Rhodesia played jointly with Southern Rhodesia as RHODESIA wearing the famous Green and White hooped jersey as their international strip. In 1924 a British side would play against the Rhodesias. On 14 July 1928, Rhodesia played in Bulawayo against New Zealand, losing 8 to 44.\nDuring their 1938 tour to South Africa, the British Lions played two matches against the Rhodesias. The first, taking place on 20 July saw the British win 25 to 11; three days later the British won again, 45 to 11; these matches were played in Salisbury and Bulawayo. The 1949 Rhodesian Rugby team, led by John Morkel, famously beat a touring All Blacks side led by Fred Allen in Bulawayo 10-8 on 27 July 1949. Three days later they drew with the mighty All Blacks in Salisbury 3-3. Thus the Rhodesias not only became and remain the only non test side country in the world to beat the All Blacks but also one of only 7 national sides (the others being test nations - British Lions, South Africa, Australia, France, Ireland and Argentina) to have won a series against them too. The Northern Rhodesians who played in the 1949 games were: flanker C Jones (Nchanga), scrum half W Viljoen (Copperbelt), Fly half E.U. Karg (Mufulira) and inside centre W.E. Brune (Mufulira)\nIn 1960, New Zealand returned to play a match on 29 June in Kitwe, Northern Rhodesia against a Rhodesian \"A\" side and narrowly won 9-13 and then again on 2 July at Glamis Park, Salisbury with a full Rhodesia side losing 14 to 29, though gave the All Blacks a scare yet again, with the game being tied 6 all by half time. The 1962 tour of South Africa by the British Lions had Rhodesia as the opening fixture on the tour. The opening game of the Lions tour saw the visitors win in Bulawayo, beating Rhodesia 38 to 9 on 26 May. The next tour, in 1962, the Lions won in Salisbury, beating the side 32 to 6.\nThe famous Andy McDonald who played for the Springboks farmed just outside Livingstone. He once had shot at a lion which was attacking his cattle, but the lion turned on him and Andy fought against it bare fisted. The lion later pulled away and died of exhaustion! Colin Meades the All Blacks captain and known as a fearsome if not slightly unruly player said that McDonald was the strongest player he had ever played against, and for good reason. Other players from that era were Ronnie Hill and Des van Jaarsveld who started their rugby careers in Northern Rhodesia before moving south Van Jaarsveld went on to captain the Springboks just the once against Scotland and became the first Springbok captain who could not speak a word of Afrikaans!\nNorthern Rhodesia played against Southern Rhodesia in the Clarke Cup which Northern Rhodesia won more times than Southern Rhodesia. This was largely due to the number of excellent rugby players (Springboks amongst them) working on the Copperbelt at the time. The Northern Rhodesians played in a Royal Blue Jersey with two stripes (white and gold) across the chest whilst the Southerners played in Green with broad white stripe across the chest. The Green/White hooped jersey was originally used by the joint Rhodesian side for international games.\nNational teams.\nSevens rugby has become a strong point. The Zambia national rugby sevens team has beaten Italy and Canada, and came within 30 seconds of upsetting Australia, in the end narrowly losing 11-12. Zambia has appeared on the international stage, both at the South Africa Sevens and the Dubai Sevens.\nZambia also competes in the Africa Cup.\nClub Competition.\nZambia has an active league that has recently been amended to consist of a Super 8 format with a second league comprising smaller clubs and second teams from the Super 8. The season runs from March to October and consists of a period of time for league matches, a break for sevens rugby.\nMost clubs start training in the middle of January ready for the season to begin in March. League matches are played up until the start of June when a break is taken to allow concentration on sevens events. During the months break there are a number of local 7s events including the Rhino Sevens in Ndola, the Mufulira Sevens (the first sevens tournament held in Zambia) and the Mosi Sevens in Lusaka. The league continues again in July and generally runs through to October when the knock out cup competition takes place.\nIn Lusaka there are four active rugby clubs. Lusaka Rugby Club, Nkwazi rugby team , Green Buffaloes (the army team) and Red Arrows (the air force team) all play within Lusaka Showgrounds (see map on the Lusaka Rugby Club page) and both Lusaka Rugby Club and Red Arrows have an active club house with a number of facilities available for members and signed-in guests.\nOn the Great North Road between Lusaka and the Copperbelt is the town of Kabwe, home of Green Eagles Rugby Club.\nIn the Copperbelt, rugby is most popular, near or surpassing football. Towns all have their own rugby teams with a varying degree of facilities available at each club. Diggers Rugby Club in Kitwe has over the past few years been the most successful of the Copperbelt clubs and is the most active in terms of the number of players and of social activities happening at the club. They even have another team, Diggers B, active in the B-League. Nchanga Rugby Club are in Chingola, Roan Rugby Club are in Luanshya, Konkola Rugby Club is in Chilalabombwe and Mufulira popularly known as 'Reggae Boys', Ndola 'Killer Bees' and Chibuluma each have their own rugby club. Other teams are Kanshanshi in Solwezi, Prison Leopards in Kabwe while Kitwe Playing Fields and Chandesi have clubs in their respective towns.\nThe Roan Antelope Club in Luanshya formerly held the record for highest goal posts in the world, and were recognised by the \"Guinness Book of Records\" - they were 110 ft, 6 inches high.\nYouth.\nRugby is becoming increasingly popular with it being very active in schools such as Mpelembe Secondary School, Kitwe Boys, David Kaunda Technical School, Icengelo and Lechwe, both of the latter are Trust Schools. Two annual tournaments sponsored First Quantum Minerals (FQM) are hosted, one for Fifteens and the other for Sevens. Mpelembe and Icengelo have been the two most successful. Mpelembe went on to get sponsorship from mobile service providing giant, MTN, which was recently withdrawn.\nMiscellaneous.\nBob Hesford, born in Luanshya played for England gaining his first cap against Scotland at Twickenham on 21 February 1981. His position was flanker or wing forward. He played 5 test matches in his career. He also played for the Barbarians."
