        "title": "Bowling Green–Toledo football rivalry",
        "text": "The Bowling Green–Toledo football rivalry is annual college football rivalry game between Mid-American Conference members Bowling Green State University (BGSU) and the University of Toledo (UT). The universities are separated by about along Interstate 75 (I-75). The Bowling Green Falcons and Toledo Rockets have exchanged two traveling trophies; the Peace Pipe Trophy (1980–2010), and the Battle of I-75 Trophy (2011–present). Toledo currently leads the series 43–41–4.\nHistory.\nThe game is sometimes referred to as The Black Swamp Showdown and the Battle of I-75, as the cities of Toledo and Bowling Green are both located on I-75, just apart, and in the Black Swamp area of Northwest Ohio.\nTraveling trophies.\nPeace Pipe Trophy.\nIn 1980, a scale-down replica was fashioned and placed on top of a trophy created by former UT football player Frank Kralik. The Peace Pipe Trophy is a miniature replica of an American Indian sacred ceremonial pipe, sitting atop a trophy with both football teams' logos. Kralik donated the trophy to the university to be given to the winner of each year's football game, which like many other college football rivalries is usually the last game of the regular season for both teams. Though the two schools play in different divisions in the Mid-American Conference, they have yet to meet in the MAC Championship Game.\nThe awarding of the Peace Pipe Trophy was discontinued after the 2010 game. The schools agreed to change the trophy after conversations with members of the American Indian community. Taken into consideration was the spiritual symbolism of the ceremonial pipe to the American Indian community, as well as the NCAA's push to remove inappropriate American Indian nicknames and symbols associated with member's athletic teams. The Peace Pipe Trophy will be permanently housed in the Toledo football trophy case as the Rockets won the last battle for the Peace Pipe in 2010.\nBattle of I-75 Trophy.\nBeginning in 2011, the two schools started playing for the Battle of I-75 Trophy. Sponsored by Taylor Kia Automotive Group, it replaced the Peace Pipe Trophy. The Battle of I-75 Trophy was designed by Jeff Artz, who also designed the Fred Biletnikoff Award (awarded to America's top college football wide receiver). Toledo leads 10–2.\nRecent Toledo domination.\nToledo won nine straight games from 2010 to 2018. The 2017 contest was, \"a snoozer as they blew out the Falcons 66–37 before a crowd that barely dented the Doyt’s capacity. Coaches on both teams agreed, \"the fiercest and most-heated rivalry in the Mid-American Conference has lost some luster, and that's probably because of the lopsidedness\". In 2019, on the 100th anniversary of the rivalry, Toledo's streak ended as Bowling Green, a 26-point underdog, defeated the Rockets. The Falcons coached by first-year Head Coach Scot Loeffler dominated all game. Walk-on Grant Loy got his first career start at QB, rushing for 137 yards and a TD while throwing for another. The Falcons Defense led by Brandon Perce held the dominant Toledo offense to only 7 points as the Falcons won 20–7. Toledo resumed their winning ways in 2020 to continue to lead the overall series.\nNotable games.\n2010: First primetime game.\nOn November 17, 2010, Toledo and Bowling Green met for the first primetime game in series history. The game was held in Toledo and broadcast by ESPN2, Dave Neal and Andre Ware on the call. Toledo Rockets came into the game with a 6–4 record on the season. The Bowling Green Falcons came into the game at 2–8 on the season. The game was the last time they play for the Peace Pipe Trophy due to conversations with members of the American Indian community. Taken into consideration was the spiritual symbolism of the ceremonial pipe to the American Indian community, as well as the NCAA's push to remove inappropriate American Indian nicknames and symbols associated with member's athletic teams. Toledo defeated Bowling Green 33–14. The Rockets gained 537 yards and held the Falcons to 254 yards. Toledo forced five turnovers (three fumbles and two interceptions) in the game and gave up one interception. Toledo took a 26–7 lead at halftime. Then they only score fourteen points all together in the second half. \n2022: Barstool college football show.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Barstool College Football Show went to the Glass Bowl for the 87th meeting of Toledo and Bowling Green rivalry. Dan Katz also known as \"Big Cat\" received the key to Toledo from Wade Kapszukiewicz the mayor of Toledo. Bowling Green upset the Rockets in the snow by the score of 42–35."

        "text": "George Edkin Little (May 27, 1889 – February 23, 1957) was an American football player, and coach of football, basketball, and baseball, and college athletics administrator.\nLittle attended Ohio Wesleyan University from which he graduated in 1912. He served as the head football coach at the University of Cincinnati (1914–1915), Miami University (1916, 1919–1921), the University of Michigan (1924), and the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1925–1926), compiling a career college football record of 54–16–4. Little was also the head basketball coach at Cincinnati (1914–1916) and Miami (1916–1917, 1919–1922), tallying a career college basketball mark of 47–38.\nIn addition to coaching, Little served as the athletic director at Wisconsin (1925–1932) and Rutgers University (1932–1953) and as the executive secretary of the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1955.\nEarly years.\nLittle was born in May 1889 in Washington, D.C. His father, George Little, was a Pennsylvania native and a school teacher. His mother, Marion Little, was also a Pennsylvania native. He had a younger brother, Howard Little (born July 1890), and a younger sister, Elizabeth Little (born February 1897). At the time of the 1900 United States Census, the family was living in Wolf Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania.\nOhio Wesleyan.\nLittle attended Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, receiving a bachelor of science degree in 1912. He played as a guard on the Ohio Wesleyan football teams of 1909, 1910, and 1911. He also received three letters for his participation on the track team, and was president of the student body and student senate. The 1911 Ohio Wesleyan football team compiled a 6–3 record, held its opponents scoreless in all six victories, and narrowly lost to Ohio State by a 3–0 score. The 1912 Ohio Wesleyan yearbook, Le Bijou, said the following of Little:\nPrexy\" Little has won distinction as an athlete and a politician. For years he has guarded Wesleyan's interests on the gridiron, but has not limited his loyalty to that enterprise. We do not know what political intrigue made him President of the Student Body, but we know he has filled his office acceptably. He is a fellow of the fellows – not of any group, but of all the students. We respect him for his integrity, his sincerity, and his ability.\nCoaching and administrative career.\nOhio State.\nAfter graduating from Wesleyan, Little attended Ohio State University as an agriculture student. While there, he also served as an assistant coach for the 1912 and 1913 Ohio State Buckeyes football teams. He was \"given credit for lending much help\" to John Wilce in leading the 1912 Ohio State team to an Ohio Athletic Conference championship. The success of the 1912 team led to Ohio State's admission to the Big Ten Conference for the 1913 season.\nCincinnati.\nIn January 1914, Little was hired as the head football coach at University of Cincinnati. During the 1914 season, Little led Cincinnati to a 6–3 record, as his team shut out five opponents and outscored all opponents, 164 to 44. In 1915, his team compiled a 4–5 record and was outscored, 158 to 110.\nMiami.\nIn January 1916, Little was hired as the head football coach at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, succeeding Chester J. Roberts. During the 1916 season, Little led Miami to a 7–0–1 record and an Ohio Athletic Conference championship. This team shut out six of eight opponents and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 238 to 12. The only blemish on the record of the 1916 team as a scoreless tie with Denison.\nLittle's tenure was interrupted by his service in the armed forces during World War I. He served as a captain in the infantry from August 15, 1917, to August 7, 1918.\nHe returned and led the Redskins a 7–1 record in 1919 and a 5–2–1 record in 1920. He once again won the Ohio Athletic Conference championship in 1921 with a perfect 8–0 record. The 1921 team scored 238 points during the season and gave up only 13. In his four years as Miami's head coach, Little compiled a record of 27–3–2 including 21 games where the opponent did not score. He left Miami to become Fielding H. Yost's top assistant at the University of Michigan.\nMichigan.\nIn May 1922, Little was hired by the University of Michigan as assistant athletic director and assistant football coach. Little was the top assistant under Fielding H. Yost for the 1922 and 1923 seasons before being named head coach for the 1924 season. That year, he compiled a record of 6–2. Little and the Wolverines shut out their opponents in five of the six victories.\nWisconsin.\nIn January 1925, Little accepted an offer from the University of Wisconsin to become its athletic director. He also served as the head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers football team during the 1925 and 1926 seasons, compiling records of 6–1–1 in 1925 and 5–2–1 in 1926. His 1925 team finished in second place in the Big Ten Conference with its only loss being against his former team, Michigan, by a score of 21–0. The Wolverines were led by Yost, who had returned to the head coaching position.\nIn January 1927, Little stepped down as head coach of the Wisconsin football team to devote his full efforts to his position as the school's athletic director. His accomplishments as athletic director include the construction of the Wisconsin Field House in 1930. In December 1931, Little tendered his resignation as Wisconsin's athletic director, effective at the end of the academic year.\nRutgers.\nIn February 1932, Little resigned as Wisconsin's athletic director to accept a position as director of physical education at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, effective in April 1932. In that position, Little had control over intercollegiate and intramural sports as well as required and advanced physical education. He continued to be athletic director at Rutgers for more than 20 years. During his tenure at Rutgers, his accomplishments included the 1938 hiring of head football coach Harvey Harman, later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was also \"instrumental\" in the construction of Rugers Stadium, using funding from the Works Progress Administration. The 1938 dedication game resulted in the first Rutgers victory over Princeton since the first college football game in 1869. The stadium served as the home field for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team from 1938 to 1992.\nIn January 1952, Little was appointed as the executive director of the National Football Foundation and the National Football Hall of Fame (later renamed the College Football Hall of Fame) located on the Rutgers campus. He took a leave of absence from his position as Rutgers' athletic director and became seriously ill for several months during 1952.\nIn December 1953, Little formally stepped down as Rutgers' athletic director and assumed a new position as special assistant to the university president. He also continued in his post as executive secretary of the National Football Hall of Fame.\nLater years and honors.\nLittle continued to serve as executive secretary of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame until his death in 1957. In July 1955, Little was one of five coaches (along with Bernie Bierman, Wallace Wade, Matty Bell, and Eddie N. Robinson) inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted as a coach but also \"due to his work in organizing the Hall of Fame and serving as executive secretary.\"\nIn February 1957, Little died at age 67 from uremia at Middlesex General Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Little's funeral service was held at Kirkpatrick Chapel on Rutgers campus; he was buried at Picture Rocks, Pennsylvania.\nSince his death, several posthumous honors have been bestowed on Little, including the following:"

        "title": "Australian Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The Australian Rugby Championship, often abbreviated to the ARC and also known as the Mazda Australian Rugby Championship for sponsorship purposes, was a domestic professional men's rugby union football competition in Australia, which ran for only one season in 2007. It was the predecessor to the also now-defunct National Rugby Championship. The competition, similar to New Zealand's ITM Cup and South Africa's Currie Cup, aimed to bridge the gap between existing club rugby and the international Super Rugby competition then known as Super 14. The ARC involved eight teams: three from New South Wales, two from Queensland, and one each from the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Western Australia.\nFrom its inception the ARC divided many in Australian rugby, with arguments over the structure and format of the competition, and concerns that the creation of arbitrary state-based teams would undermine the strong club competitions in Sydney and Brisbane. On 18 December 2007, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) announced that the ARC would be shut down due to heavy financial losses: the ARC lost A$4.7 million during the 2007 season, with projected losses of $3.3 million for 2008.\nOn 10 December 2013, Bill Pulver, the CEO of the Australian Rugby Union, announced a new competition along similar lines, the National Rugby Championship, to include 8 to 10 teams in \"major population centres\".\nHistory.\nThe official announcement on the agreement to create a national rugby competition in Australia was made in mid-2006, following a 70-person three-day summit in Sydney that agreed to an eight team competition. However, the competition was not without its share of controversy, with some of the strong state-level clubs being against the formation of a new level of competition, claiming it could harm club and grassroots rugby. In September, an ARU board meeting, after hearing these concerns, officially approved the new competition.\nA month later, the competition kicked off, however the Queensland teams performed poorly as the East Coast Aces and Ballymore Tornadoes finished last and second last respectively. \nThe Perth Spirit performed the best out of the regular rounds winning six out of eight games, but due to bonus points finished third on the ladder behind the Central Coast Rays and minor premiers the .\nAfter the top four teams took part in the semi-finals, the Melbourne Rebels and Central Coast Rays would compete in the first and last ARC Grand Final: the Rays defeated the Rebels 20–12 to win the premiership.\nAfter a review of the ARC was undertaken following the 2007 season, it was found that it had run $1.3 million over budget and had lost $4.7 million for the 2007 season, with forecast losses for a 2008 season coming to a further $3.3 million. The ARU, concluding that a cumulative loss of $8 million over two years would be fiscal irresponsiblity and that it was likely there would be further heavy future losses beyond 2008, immediately decided to shut down the competition.\nFinal.\nDetails for the only season held:\nFormat.\nCompetition.\nThe competition ran for eight weeks, with finals being competed over an additional two weeks - each side played eight games, with the top four teams qualifying for the semi-finals where the winners move into the final. The competition kicked off in August, after the Super 14 and the March to July club competitions finished, and avoiding a clash with Australian under-19 and under-21 duties and the Pacific Nations Cup (in which Australia A played). In total, 35 matches were played in the ARC over 10 weeks from 11 August and 14 October, with games played on Fridays and Sundays. It was originally planned that games would not be played at 'traditional' times for rugby matches, but this decision was changed when the ABC insisted that its televised games be played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The inaugural final was played between the Central Coast Rays and the Melbourne Rebels in Gosford.\nPlayers.\nThe timeframe of the season ensured the availability of Super 14 players (excluding Wallabies). There was no draft, and players were free to choose their team, although there was a salary cap in place. Players came from local competitions (which includes Super 14 players). Each Super 14 franchise was aligned with the respective teams, except for Melbourne, as Victoria had no Super rugby team at the time.\nIt was planned that although 35 footballers will be on international duty for the Wallabies, over 90 Super 14 players would go into the ARC, leaving the way for over 120 footballers to step up from first grade club competitions.\nIt was also planned that each team would have one \"marquee\" footballer not be subject to financial restrictions of the player contracting protocol. The player could be either foreign or a non-contracted domestic footballer, and if a team signed an Australian as their marquee footballer, they would still be able to sign up a foreign footballer, though they would have to fit within the contract restrictions.\nRules.\nThe ARU announced in June 2007 that the inaugural championship would adopt the Experimental Law Variations (ELVs), which were initially trialled at South Africa's Stellenbosch University and which aim to bring more free-flowing play into the game. The laws were implemented in both the Sydney and Brisbane club competitions and were well received.\nReferees.\nThe referees supplied for the tournament predominantly come from the Australian Rugby Union Panels.\nReferees for the tournament included: Matt Goddard, James Leckie, James Scholtens, George Ayoub, Daniel Cheever, Brett Bowden, Andrew Lindsay and Geoff Acton.\nStuart Dickinson and Paul Marks did not referee in the tournament, as they refereed at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Championship was broadcast on free-to-air television during its only season. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) secured the rights to exclusively televise the competition from 2007 through to 2009 by agreeing to accept a substantial fee from the ARU in order to cover the matches. \nThe fact that the sport's governing organisation had to pay a television station to broadcast the Championship arguably left worrying implications for a code that was struggling to attract mainstream interest in Australia. The ABC committed to broadcast 19 matches during the season on ABC1 and ABC2: two matches from each round, the semi-finals and the final. \nThe previous time the ABC had covered elite-level rugby was for the 1991 Rugby World Cup (which Australia won).\nRegular season 2007.\nThe eight teams played four home games and four away games each during the preliminary competition rounds, consisting of a single round-robin with each team playing each other once plus an additional return match for the \"derby\" fixture played in the first round (these fixtures were matches between the closest neighbouring teams in most cases). The top four teams at the end of the preliminary competition rounds qualified for the title play-offs with semi-finals and finals.\nTitle play-offs 2007.\nThe top four sides in the regular season advanced to the knock-out stage of semi-finals and final to decide the Australian Rugby Championship title.\nPlayers 2007.\nLeading try scorers.\nSource: rugby.com.au\nLeading point scorers.\nSource: rugby.com.au\nSquad lists.\nTeam squad lists for the 2007 ARC:"

The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping.\nHistory.\nWhoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards.\nThe cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985. At the 1988 Winter Olympics the Gundersen method was adopted, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event.\nThe team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event.\nToday the International Ski Federation sanction no women's competitions. However it was decided in early-November 2016 that women's competitions were to be established at the Olympic Winter Games in 2022.\nMedal table.\nSources (after the 2022 Winter Olympics):&lt;br&gt;\n\"Accurate as of 2022 Winter Olympics.\""

The work gives both a general critical overview of \"Finnegans Wake\" and a detailed exegetical outline of the text.\nAccording to Campbell and Robinson, \"Finnegans Wake\" is best interpreted in light of Giambattista Vico's philosophy, which holds that history proceeds in cycles and fails to achieve meaningful progress over time.\nCampbell and Robinson began their analysis of Joyce's work because they had recognized in \"The Skin of Our Teeth\" (1942), the popular play by Thornton Wilder, an appropriation from Joyce's novel not only of themes but of plot and language as well. They published a pair of reviews-\"cum\"-denunciations of \"Skin of Our Teeth\", both entitled \"The Skin of \"Whose\" Teeth?\" in \"The Saturday Review\"."

He later served as a minor league manager, and in 1911 managed future Hall of Famer Ray Schalk in his first professional season with the Taylorville Christians. Adams had previously managed the Pana Coal Miners in 1907 and the Shelbyville Queen Citys in 1908, both in the Eastern Illinois League. According to the 1908 \"Spalding Guide\", Adams was the \"godfather\" of the Eastern Illinois League, which began in 1907 in Pana.\nBesides Shalk, other baseball figures Adams was associated with included Hall of Famer Frank Chance and minor leaguers Bert King and Dick Kinsella. By 1932 Adams owned a restaurant in Jackson, Missouri. Adams died in Montgomery City, Missouri at the age of 74 and is currently buried at Myers Cemetery in Herrick, Illinois.\nAdams' nickname of \"Wagon Tongue\" has been regarded by multiple baseball writers as one of baseball's all-time great nicknames."

        "text": "Thomas James \"Rusty\" Richards, MC (29 April 1882 – 25 September 1935) was an Australian military officer and national representative rugby union player, who was born at Vegetable Creek, Emmaville in New South Wales. Richards is the only Australian-born player to ever represent both Australia and the British Lions and as such the Tom Richards Trophy is named in his honor. He is an inductee to the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nRichard's Cornish father emigrated to Australia during the Gold Rush from Cornwall in the United Kingdom. Nicknamed \"Rusty\", he grew up in the gold mining town of Charters Towers in Northern Queensland. His interest in the rugby game developed when a New South Wales touring side visited his town. He started training and playing rugby, and went on to represent Queensland. His family moved to South Africa in 1905.\nRugby wanderer.\nHe continued playing rugby in South Africa, playing a small number of games for the Transvaal in the domestic Currie Cup competition. That year the South Africa national rugby union team was preparing for its first overseas tour to Great Britain, and the Currie Cup was used as a trial to select the touring squad. Richards was initially considered as a squad member but a complicated qualifying rule prevented his inclusion. He subsequently travelled to England where he continued playing rugby in the county championships spending a season representing Bristol. Richards also played at county level whilst in Britain and was chosen to play for Gloucester in their encounter with the South Africa team he was excluded from touring with.\nHe soon returned to Australia and became the lynch-pin of the Queensland pack, which led to him being selected for the 'Wallabies' in the 1908 tour of the United Kingdom. He played in both Test matches of the tour and was Australia's first try-scorer in the Test against Wales. The touring party took part in the 1908 Summer Olympics that were being held in London. The team won gold with Richards again scoring a try, over a Cornish side representing Great Britain. Richards thus became an Olympic Gold medallist.\nHe returned to South Africa after his touring duties. In 1910 the British Isles team were touring South Africa and in July of that year played Transvaal. The tourist had picked up a number of injuries and Richards was drafted in to face his old team as he qualified to play through his membership with Bristol. He ended up representing Britain on twelve occasions including two Tests against South Africa. He scored once for Britain, a try in the second encounter with Transvaal. He returned to Australia in 1911 and was selected to tour to the United States and Canada with Australia in 1912. He played at break-away in the sole Test of that tour - the November 1912 clash against the United States at Berkeley - and scored a try in that match. In 1913 his wanderlust returned, and he spent the year travelling around Europe, playing rugby in England, France, Italy and Switzerland. While in France he signed with Toulouse as a player and manager.\nWar service and later life.\nRichards enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 26 August 1914 and in October sailed for Egypt on the Transport \"Euripides\" with the 1st Field Ambulance. He was part of the landing at Gallipoli on the morning of 25 April 1915 and served as a stretcher-bearer. In July 1915 he was mentioned in divisional orders for \"acts of gallantry\" in May and June 1915. With the conclusion of the Gallipoli Campaign in December 1915 he returned to Egypt and then in March 1916 left for the Western Front, when he was also appointed lance corporal. On 25 November 1916 he was commissioned second lieutenant and, in December, transferred to the 1st Infantry Battalion. In May 1917, during the Battle of Arras near Bullecourt, he led a nineteen-man bombing party. He was promoted lieutenant in June 1917 and awarded the Military Cross in August for \"conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty\". In May 1917 he was accidentally injured in a bomb blast at the 1st ANZAC Training School. He was evacuated to England twice in 1917 and again in May 1918, with damage to his back and shoulders from a bomb blast. He left England in August 1918 and, after four months in South Africa en route, arrived in Sydney in February 1919 where his AIF appointment was terminated on 3 November.\nLegacy and accolades.\nThe Tom Richards Cup is the trophy that is played for between the British &amp; Irish Lions and Australia. In 2005 he was honoured as one of the inaugural five inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame. Upon his induction Australian Rugby Union President Paul McLean commented: \"late Tom Richards was an extraordinary character whom \"The Times\" described in 1908 as the first man to be picked for Earth if we were ever to play Mars!\""

        "title": "Beach rugby",
        "text": "Beach rugby is a sport that is based on rugby union. Currently there is not a centralized regulation of the sport as in beach soccer or beach volleyball, but leagues are common across Europe. The sport is particularly popular in Italy, in the Balkan region and in Eastern Europe. Casual games are played around the world using different sets of rules. However, organized leagues use a field that is only a fraction of the size of a standard rugby field, far fewer players on each team, shorter matches, and a simplified scoring system. Two popular tournaments in the United States are the 7s By The Sea tournament, held in Corpus Christi, Texas each summer, and The Beerfoot 7s tournament, played in Fort Myers Beach, Florida on the last weekend of July. \nThe inaugural European Beach Five Rugby Championships was held in Moscow in 2017 and is being held there since then.\nRules.\nIn Beach rugby, rucks, mauls, scrums, gang tackles, kicks above waist heights, lineouts are outlawed.\nField dimensions.\nThe size of a beach rugby field depends on the decision of the league. The field is between 30 and 50 metres long and 20–35 metres wide, and the in-goals are 3–7 metres deep. There are no goalposts on the field, and the lines are usually marked with some sort of tape or rope.\nNumber of players.\nDepending on the league and the field size, either 4 or 7 players are allowed on the field for one team at once. Between 3 and 7 reserves are allowed, again, depending on the league. Substitutions are often done \"on-the-fly,\" similar to ice hockey or futsal.\nThe ball.\nA standard rugby ball is used, but many leagues will use a size 4 ball instead of size 5, the size used in all levels of field rugby above youth. A rugby ball is oval-shaped and made of synthetic leather panels that have small dimples to enhance handling.\nScoring.\nMost leagues use a \"one try, one point\" scoring system, since there are no goalposts on the field. Occasionally, a sudden-death extra time period is used to resolve matches drawn at the end of regulation, but not all leagues use this rule.\nOne Italian league used a system where the in-goals were divided into five equal rectangles. A try scored from the outer rectangles was worth 3 points, from the central rectangle was 5 points, and from either of the two intermediate rectangles was worth 4 points. However, there is no evidence that this league still exists. The Ameland Beach Rugby Festival www.beachrugby.nl(The Netherlands) also uses this system.\nTiming.\nLeagues use either two 5 or 7 minute halves (with a 1 or 3 minute interval for halftime) as the length of a single match. Extra time may be played if the league in question calls for it."

The team is controlled by the Chinese Taipei Ice Hockey Federation and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Chinese Taipei is currently ranked 41st in the IIHF World Ranking and competes in the Division IIB.\nHistory.\nChinese Taipei has only been active in 1987, 2005, 2008 and 2010. In 1987, they competed unofficially in the World Championship Pool D in Perth, Australia where their best result was a 2–2 draw against Hong Kong. Chinese Taipei was not a member of the IIHF at the time, but showed up to the tournament anyway, and was allowed to play one game against each other team. In 2005, they played 3 friendlies, losing to Hong Kong once, 6–2 and defeating Thailand twice, 5–3 and 11–4. In 2008, they won the inaugural Challenge Cup of Asia held in Hong Kong. In 2009, they failed to send a team to the tournament and in April 2010, they hosted the tournament (now recognized by the IIHF) and won it again.\nAs with other sports teams, under political opposition from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China has competed under the \"Chinese Taipei\" banner as a result of the 1979 Nagoya Resolution.\nAll-time record against other nations.\nNote: Chinese Taipei was awarded a 5–0 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 2017 IIHF World Championship Division III after Bosnia and Herzegovina forfeited the game."

        "text": "Inner tube water polo (ITWP) is a variant of water polo with the important difference that players are required to float in inflatable inner tubes. By floating in an inner tube, players experience less contact and expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having to tread water. This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense conditioning required for conventional water polo.\nThis sport is predominantly played at universities, but can also be found in recreational adult leagues.\nGoalkeeper.\nThe goalkeeper position is played differently, depending on the host leagues rules. In some leagues, goalkeepers are the only players prohibited from using an innertube during play, requiring them to tread water or stand in a shallow body of water. In other leagues, goalkeepers may be permitted to play just as all other players. Finally, some leagues require the goalkeeper to play with an alteration to their tube. For example, a goalkeeper may be required to have a more deflated tube, be required to deflate and fold their tube in half and sit with the tube between their legs, or use a larger tube intended to make the goalkeeper less mobile. \nHistory.\nThe game was invented in 1969 by Gary Colberg, then UC Davis's associate athletic director of intramural sports and sport clubs.\nExternal links.\nhttps://www.bostonitwp.com"

        "title": "Mosman Rowing Club",
        "text": "Mosman Rowing Club is an all-level competitive and recreational rowing club on the North Shore of Sydney. Since 2007 the club's facilities have been wholly located at The Spit in Sydney's Middle Harbour, the northern arm of Port Jackson.\nMercantile club history.\nMosman's red and white hooped racing colours date back to 1873 when the Mercantile Rowing Club was founded on the west side of Sydney's Circular Quay at Dawes Point. A meeting of warehousemen and merchants' clerks had decided to form a second club the second in the colony (after Sydney Rowing Club). Henry Woolnough was the club's first chairman, he had earlier been a committee member at Sydney. Mercantile's first patron was the Governor of the New South Wales, Sir Hercules Robinson. Mercantile enjoyed a strong patronage but began to struggle in the 1890s and sustained losses when it opened an unsuccessful branch shed at Parramatta.\nMosman club history.\nIn 1911 due to poor water conditions in the busy port and the expiration of a lease, a decision was made to relocate the original boatshed and all rowing equipment to Mosman Bay on the northern side of the harbour and to re-establish the club as the \"Mosman Rowing Club\". The Dawes Point boatshed was purchased from the disbanded Mercantile club and rebuilt at Mosman in time for new club's official opening on 1 April 1911. The club operated from this building until 1933 when a new clubhouse was built on the same site. Boating and ferry traffic made this location less than ideal and from the 1950s senior training was done from Pearl Bay at The Spit near Mosman. A boatshed facility was built there in 1967 at the cost of $74,000. The Club's rowing facilities were progressively re-housed to Pearl Bay with the Mosman Bay site being transformed to a licensed social club. That site was closed in 2007 and major upgrading and a complete relocation to Pearl Bay had occurred by 2010.\nFrom 1956 the club owned bushland property at Killarney Heights on the foreshore of Middle Harbour with water access looking across to Castlecove. The site was used as a club recreation and rowing camp facility but was never able to be developed and fully utilised. In 2005 the club sold the land for $1.5M but retained a 150-year lease on a building on the property. In June 2012 the club also sold its lease on the building and severed its connection with the Killarney Point site.\nCompetition history.\nIn 1930 the Mosman VIII was chosen in toto as the state representative eight for New South Wales in the Kings Cup at the Australian Rowing Championships. The crew won the King's Cup. The Mosman club's win that year of the Sydney premiership pennant marked the ninth successive year the club had won the pennant and eclipsed the Sydney Rowing Club's 1880 to 1888 record for the longest successive run.\nCurrent facilities.\nThe MRC, based at Pearl Bay, Mosman is the main rowing centre for some 450 rowers, including elite, seniors, juniors, masters, recreational and school rowers. The shed houses over 100 rowing boats.\nThe MRC is self-funded by memberships, lease arrangements to schools and private members' ongoing fundraising activities. A number of Sydney's private girl's schools have a leasing and coaching arrangement with the club.\nMembers.\nMRC has had representatives in World Rowing Championships and Olympic Games rowing squads over its history. From the Rome 1960 until London 2012 the Mosman club had at least one representative in every Australian Olympic rowing squad excepting Moscow 1980 and Barcelona 1992.\nNotable club members include:\nOlympic representative members include:\nWorld Champions include:"

        "text": "Thomas Everette Wright (September 22, 1923 – September 5, 2017) was an American professional baseball player. The outfielder, born in Rutherfordton, North Carolina, played all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball (1948–56) for four American League teams. He threw right-handed, batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed as an active player.\nWright was signed by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1942. After his first professional season, he entered the United States Army Air Forces, where he served in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II and missed the 1943–45 seasons. He returned to baseball in 1946, and led the Class C Carolina League in batting average (.380) and hits (an even 200), while making the CL All-Star team. His performance earned him a three-level promotion to the Double-A Southern Association for 1947, where he batted .325 and was also named an All-Star. Then, in 1948, he hit over .300 (at .307) for a third straight season, this time in the Triple-A American Association. On September 15, , he made his Major League debut with the Red Sox—tripling as a pinch hitter in his first big-league at bat. Wright then returned to Triple-A for the entire campaign. He won the American Association batting championship (hitting .368) and collected 200 hits, second in the league. During the September 1949 pennant race, he made five pinch-hitting appearances for the Red Sox.\nWright spent all of on Boston's roster, hitting .318 in part-time and pinch-hitting duty, with 54 games played and 115 plate appearances. Of his 34 hits, only seven went for extra bases, all doubles. He then returned to Triple-A for much of , getting into only 28 games with Boston, 13 as a starting outfielder, and batting only .222. After the season, he was traded to the St. Louis Browns on November 28, 1951. In , Wright would set personal bests in games played (89) and hits (50), but he batted only .253 with two home runs and the Browns traded him after 29 games in St. Louis to the Chicago White Sox on June 15. He was a reserve outfielder for the ChiSox for the next year and a half, playing behind Minnie Miñoso, Sam Mele and Jim Rivera. During spring training on March 27, , he was traded for the third and last time, to the Washington Senators. But Wright was still unable to break into the everyday lineup, appearing in 76 games, half of them as a starting outfielder.\nHe spent most of and in minor league baseball, except for eight appearances as a pinch hitter and one game for Washington as a pinch runner at the tail end of 1955 and the beginning of 1956. On April 18, 1956, he played his final game after nine seasons in the big leagues. Wright retired after the 1957 minor league season.\nIn 341 MLB games played, Wright registered 175 hits, including 28 doubles and 11 triples, as well as six home runs and 99 RBI. He batted .255 lifetime.\nWright died September 5, 2017, aged 93.\nExternal links.\n, or SABR Biography Project"

        "title": "2006 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2006 UEFA Champions League final was an association football match between Barcelona of Spain and Arsenal of England at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Paris, France, on Wednesday, 17 May 2006. It was the final match of the 2005–06 season of Europe's primary cup competition, the UEFA Champions League. Barcelona were appearing in their fifth final, having won the competition once in 1992, while it was Arsenal's first (and to date, only) final appearance and the first appearance by a club from London.\nEach club progressed through the group stage and three knockout rounds to reach the final, playing 12 matches in total. Barcelona won their group and progressed to the final after beating Chelsea, Benfica and Milan, respectively. Arsenal won their group to move into the knockout stage, and progressed without conceding a goal against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, respectively.\nA crowd of 79,500 watched as Jens Lehmann was sent off early in the game. Despite this setback, Arsenal took the lead through Sol Campbell towards the end of the first half. After an hour, Henrik Larsson came on for Barcelona and was involved in both of their goals. Barcelona equalised through Samuel Eto'o near the end of the second half, and a few minutes later, Juliano Belletti scored to give Barcelona a 2–1 victory. This was Barcelona's second triumph in the competition, 14 years after they won their first European Cup in 1992.\nRoute to the final.\nTeams qualified for the Champions League group stage, either directly or through three preliminary rounds, based on both their position in the preceding domestic league and the strength of that league. Both Arsenal and Barcelona entered the competition in the group stages: Arsenal by finishing second in the 2004–05 FA Premier League, and Barcelona by winning La Liga. The group stages were contested as eight double round robin groups of four teams, with the top two qualifying for the knockout stage. Knockout matches were decided based on home and away matches, with the away goals rule, extra time and penalty shootouts as tiebreakers if needed.\nBuild-up.\nUEFA awarded the right to host the final to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis after considering its merits in terms of capacity, stadium infrastructure and dossiers including city and airport agreements and promotional plans. UEFA also conducted a variety of site visits. The Stade de France had previously staged the 2000 UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Valencia, which Madrid won 3–0. Saint-Denis was chosen to host the final in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first European Cup final in 1956, held in nearby Paris at the Parc des Princes, now home of Paris Saint-Germain. The Parc des Princes also hosted the 1975 and 1981 European Cup finals, the 1978 and 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals, and the 1998 UEFA Cup final.\nBarcelona showed the match live from their Mini Estadi on a television screen for an estimated audience of 15,276. Before the final, an estimated 1.2 million people descended into the streets of Barcelona, as the team toured the city on two open-top double-decker buses to celebrate winning La Liga. Arsenal went into the match with the record for the longest time without a conceding a goal, having played 919 minutes since conceding against AFC Ajax in the group stage. Arsenal's appearance in the match came six years to the day since their last European final, when they faced Galatasaray in the 2000 UEFA Cup final; they lost on penalties after the match had finished goalless after extra time. Of the players who featured in that final, only Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp remained at the club, while Sylvinho, who had featured for Arsenal in the final, was now a Barcelona player.\nIt was the first time Arsenal had appeared in the European Cup final, which also made them the first club from London to do so. Barcelona were appearing in the final for the fifth time; their last appearance was a 4–0 loss to Milan in 1994. Two more losses preceded the 1994 final (1961 and 1986), and their only success in the competition came in 1992 when they beat Sampdoria. Barcelona went into the final as domestic league champions, having won La Liga a fortnight earlier. They were regarded as the best side on the continent because they possessed players such as Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o. Barcelona player Deco dismissed the notion of Barcelona being favourites, insisting they would not be complacent: \"Milan were winning 3–0 last year against Liverpool and ended up losing in the end. We need to be serious, calm and fully concentrated so that we don't make any errors\".\nNeither side had been beaten en route to the final, with Arsenal only conceding two goals in their 12 matches before the final, including a record ten successive matches without conceding. Barcelona, on the other hand, had scored 114 goals in all competitions before the final. The two finalists were guaranteed a financial windfall from their progress to the final. Arsenal would receive a revenue of around €37.3 million if they won and approximately €34.7 million if they lost. Barcelona would earn €31.5 million from revenue if they won, and around €28.9 million if they were to lose. Included in the total for participating in the final, the UEFA Champions League winners would collect approximately €6.4 million, with the runners-up receiving approximately €3.8 million. The final marked the appearance of a new trophy following Liverpool's triumph over Milan the previous year. As Liverpool won the competition for the fifth time they were entitled to keep the trophy, creating the need for a new one.\nBarcelona were expected to line up in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. He had pulled a thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he was included in the 22-man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would leave it late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad, Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal were expected to line up in a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pires on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match that this would be Pires' last match as he had agreed to join Villarreal next season.\nOn the morning of the final it emerged that the assistant referee for the game Ole Hermann Borgan had posed for photographs in a Barcelona shirt for \"Drammens Tidende\", a Norwegian newspaper. After initially sticking by the official, UEFA eventually decided to replace him with fellow Norwegian Arild Sundet. Norway's head of refereeing Rune Pedersen stated: \"It is an unwritten rule that referees should not do anything that can doubt their impartial stance\".\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nBarcelona fielded a 4–3–3 formation with Mark van Bommel and Edmílson lining up in midfield alongside Deco, ahead of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. Lionel Messi did not feature in the matchday squad, despite returning from injury and featuring in the 22-man squad, while Henrik Larsson was among the substitutes in potentially his last game for the club. Arsenal fielded a 4–4–1–1 formation, which saw Emmanuel Eboué replace the injured Lauren, and Ashley Cole return at left-back to make only his third appearance in the competition that season due to injury. Thierry Henry was deployed as the lone striker, with Freddie Ljungberg playing off his shoulder.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nAs both teams' first-choice kits featured a shade of red, Arsenal wore their yellow away strip, while Barcelona wore their traditional blue and maroon striped kit. Arsenal won the coin toss and Barcelona kicked off. Barcelona almost immediately came under pressure when Thierry Henry shot straight at Barcelona goalkeeper Víctor Valdés, who conceded a corner. From the resulting corner Arsenal had another chance again courtesy of Henry, whose shot was again saved by Valdés. The next attack in the seventh minute resulted in Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann saving from Ludovic Giuly after he shot from a narrow angle. Four minutes later Barcelona were awarded a free-kick 35 yards from goal; Ronaldinho shot wide of the goal.\nWith 18 minutes played, Lehmann became the first player to be sent off in a European Cup final after he brought down Samuel Eto'o outside the Arsenal box. Giuly subsequently put the ball in the back of the net, but the goal was not allowed due to the foul. Arsenal substituted Robert Pires for Manuel Almunia, their substitute goalkeeper. The free-kick was sent wide by Ronaldinho. Following Lehmann's dismissal Barcelona exerted more pressure on Arsenal, to the point where Emmanuel Eboué was cautioned for a high tackle.\nIn the 37th minute Arsenal overcame their numerical disadvantage to score when Sol Campbell headed in from a Thierry Henry free-kick following Carles Puyol's foul on Emmanuel Eboué. Some believed that Eboué was guilty of diving. Arsenal held onto their lead for the remainder of the half. Barcelona's best chance came from Eto'o, whose shot hit the post via a save from Almunia.\nSecond half.\nAt half-time, Barcelona replaced Edmílson, who had picked up an injury in the first half, with Andrés Iniesta. Almunia saved a shot from Iniesta six minutes into the half.\nAfter 61 minutes, Barcelona substituted Larsson for Van Bommel. Minutes later, Alexander Hleb received a pass from Henry but shot wide of the goal. Arsenal began to press forward and both Henry and Ljungberg saw shots saved; Henry then had another chance to score after being put through by Hleb, but he shot straight at Valdés. Following this attack, Oleguer was replaced by Juliano Belletti, and Arsenal replaced Cesc Fàbregas with Mathieu Flamini.\nNext, Iniesta sent a pass through the inside-left channel to Larsson whose one-touch, right-footed lay-off quickly released Eto'o to equalise for Barcelona. Four minutes later, Larsson was again the provider, playing a one-two with Belletti in the inside-right channel, before the Brazilian full-back shot right-footed through Almunia's legs to score at the near post.\nThe remaining minutes saw Arsenal replace Hleb with Reyes in an attempt to equalise, but Barcelona had the best chance during this period, only for Giuly to hit his shot straight at Almunia. Following this, Larsson impeded the Arsenal goalkeeper and was cautioned. The match finished soon after with Barcelona winning 2–1. With this defeat, Arsenal became the first English club and third overall – after Hamburger SV and Fiorentina – to have been runner-up in all three major European competitions (European Champion Clubs' Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the now-defunct Cup Winners' Cup).\nPost-match.\nBarcelona captain Carles Puyol collected the trophy from UEFA president Lennart Johansson as Barcelona celebrated their second European Cup triumph. As a result of winning the UEFA Champions League, Barcelona would face Sevilla, the winners of the UEFA Cup, in the UEFA Super Cup. The subsequent match, played on 25 August 2006, was won 3–0 by Sevilla. Barcelona's victory meant they would also participate in the FIFA Club World Cup. Receiving a bye in the first round, they beat Club América 4–0 in the semi-finals to progress to the final where they faced Copa Libertadores champions Internacional, who won 1–0.\nMuch of the discussion after the match centred around referee Terje Hauge's decision to send off Lehmann. Football pundit Mark Lawrenson stated: \"The game changed when Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off\". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger agreed: \"When Jens Lehmann got sent off, that left us with 70 minutes to play with ten against eleven, against a team that retains the ball very well\". He refused to openly criticise this decision, although he did criticise the decision to award Barcelona's first goal, as he felt that Samuel Eto'o was offside. Wenger was also adamant that his young side would bounce back from the defeat. One person who did criticise the referee was Thierry Henry, stating: \"I was kicked all over the place. I expected the referee to do his job. I don't think he did\". There was much discussion after the match over whether Henry would remain with Arsenal or move to Barcelona, whom he had been linked with a move to over the past months. Arsène Wenger was asked post match if Henry would leave, to which the Arsenal manager replied: \"I don't know. I don't think so\". However, on 19 May, Henry signed a new four-year contract with Arsenal, ending the speculation about a possible move to Barcelona.\nThierry Henry paid tribute to Larsson's contribution to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, \"People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; you need to talk about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight.\" Henry also remarked, \"You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision.\" Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.\nHenrik Larsson, who provided the two assists for the goals, was delighted with the triumph and had no regrets over deciding to leave Barcelona after the match: \"I want to play football. I feel I haven't played as much as I would love to because of the great players we have at Barcelona\". Fellow Barcelona player Giovanni van Bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club: \"It's special to win the final, and even more special to do it against your old team\". Samuel Eto'o, scorer of Barcelona's first goal, cited Liverpool's comeback against Milan as inspiration for Barcelona's victory: \"After having seen what Liverpool did last year, we told ourselves not to throw in the towel. We followed Liverpool's example\". Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard praised the role of goalkeeper Victor Valdés in their victory, stating that he made a number of important saves to keep them in the match: \"Valdes played a decisive role. He saved us at crucial moments\"."

Top seeds Roger Federer and Justine Henin managed to defeat their opponents easily. Philipp Kohlschreiber became the first seeded player to exit the tournament. Seeded players Martina Hingis and Patty Schnyder were pushed by their opponents, each playing 3 sets with Hingis saving 2 match points. Serena Williams, Marion Bartoli and Shahar Pe'er won their games simply.\nDay 2.\nDaniela Hantuchová easily dispatched Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Favourites such as Jelena Janković, Maria Sharapova, Amélie Mauresmo, Novak Djokovic, James Blake and Rafael Nadal won their matches with ease. However, Venus Williams was almost knocked out by Alla Kudryavtseva, when she won 2–6, 6–3, 7–5.\nDay 3.\nAndy Roddick and Richard Gasquet advanced towards third round, true to expectations. Justine Henin, Ana Ivanovic, Martina Hingis and Serena Williams also beat their opponents with little difficulty. Lucky loser Alizé Cornet defeated ranked number 42 Maria Kirilenko. Unfortunately the evening matches were delayed due to the rain.\nDay 4.\nDinara Safina became today's highest-ranked woman to lose, while Tommy Robredo the highest-ranked man to lose on day 4. However, other seeded players like Ana Ivanovic, Elena Dementieva, Roger Federer and Marat Safin have done their jobs well and advanced towards third round. Also, Serena and Venus Williams returned to their doubles competitions by beating Anne Keothavong and Claire Curran in the first round.\nDay 5.\nThe players who began their games at 11 o'clock were delayed by rain, but it did not affect Justine Henin, Jelena Janković and Patty Schnyder who all hastily completed their matches. Anna Chakvetadze is the highest-ranked woman to lose so far, while Fernando González became the highest-seeded man to lose so far.\nDay 6.\nThe tournament suffered massive rain disruptions, with Amélie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova being the only singles players to complete (and win) their matches. The afternoon matches were also delayed by rain. Fans on Centre and Court 2 received full refunds; because they saw less than an hour of play, with Mauresmo's win lasting 57 minutes.\nDay 7.\nThere was a little bit of rain and a few surprises too. Although there was more rain, Justine Henin found time to advance to the quarterfinals, while Elena Dementieva surprised everyone by losing to an unseeded Tamira Paszek. Agnieszka Radwańska, after sending seeded Martina Müller out in the second round a few days earlier, couldn't do the same thing to Svetlana Kuznetsova. In a highly intense match, Serena Williams cramped against Daniela Hantuchová late in a second set. Serena battled the injury, losing the second set tie-break but winning after a rain delay.\nDay 8.\nMost of the women's 4th round matches were delayed by rain, however, some matches were completed; Svetlana Kuznetsova ended Tamira Paszek's dazzling run; 3rd seed and in-form Serb Jelena Janković was defeated by Marion Bartoli; and 2006 champion and 4th seed Amélie Mauresmo fell to Nicole Vaidišová.\nDay 9.\nRafael Nadal finally won his match against Robin Söderling, which had lasted since Saturday.

Maria Sharapova lost to Venus Williams in straight sets 6–1, 6–3 in one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Justine Henin and Marion Bartoli became the first female semifinalists. The second round doubles match between Brazilians André Sá and Marcelo Melo against Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett set two Wimbledon records, one of most games played in a match (102) and the longest fifth set ever (28–26). This was the second longest match in the history of The Championships, at 5 hours and 58 minutes. The Brazilian duo won.\nDay 10.\nVenus Williams became another semifinalist after her victory over Svetlana Kuznetsova in straight sets again.

He played college football at McNeese State University. He was signed by the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2004, and also played for the Kansas City Chiefs and California Redwoods.\nProfessional career.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nFor the first three years of his career, Sams proved to be a valuable asset to the Ravens return game, and one of the better return men in the league. After joining the team as an undrafted free agent, his rookie season he posted 1826 total kick and punt return yards., including 2 punt return touchdowns. The following season, he missed two games, but still recorded 1,399 total return yards, with a career long of 82 yards. In 2006, he had an equally productive season, and was on pace to have the best season of his career before going down with injury in Game 12. Two weeks prior to that, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had one of the best games of his career, returning for more yards than the Falcons had rushing, combined, at 212. His best career game, his rookie season, he had 250 total yards and a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs.\nSams suffered a broken leg against the Cincinnati Bengals and missed the remainder of Baltimore's 2007 season. Before suffering the injury, he helped keep the team in the game with 177 return yards, though they would ultimately lose on a late flag that negated a Todd Heap touchdown.\nAlthough he was let go following this season, in favor of Yamon Figurs, a return man who wound up being released himself in 2009, in Sams' career as a Raven prior to injury, he became the second best return specialist in Baltimore Ravens history, with 4,481 total return yards in just over three seasons. That mark is second only to Jermaine Lewis, who was the team's all-time leading return man, with 5,883 regular season return yards in six seasons.\nHis rookie season mark of 1,251 kick return yards, still stands as the best single season kick return total in team history.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nOn April 9, 2008, Sams signed a one-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was released four games into the regular season on October 1 after the team signed wide receiver Mark Bradley.\nCalifornia Redwoods.\nSams was drafted by the California Redwoods of the United Football League in the UFL Premiere Season Draft in 2009. He signed with the team on August 18.\nHe led the UFL's inaugural season as the league's leading kick returner, with 375 yards.\nNFL statistics.\nReturning Stats "

The association is funded by player fees and private sponsorship.\nHistory.\nIn 1988, an ice skating rink was built in Singapore by a private investor; Fuji Ice Palace in the outskirts of the City Central. In the mid-1990s the Fuji Ice Palace&gt; found a new location at Jurong East Entertainment Center (near the Jurong East MRT station) where it has operated until 2008. By 16 October 2008, Fuji Ice Palace had ceased its operations. By the year 2012, three more ice skating rinks have been built. Namely, Kallang Ice World, Marina Bay Sands and The Rink @ Jcube, in which The Rink @ JCube stands on the previous location of the Fuji Ice Palace. In 1997 a local league was started at Fuji, organized by the Ice Hockey Association, Singapore (IHAS)) with six teams. Due to the high costs for individual players, the league shut down after one year of operation. Between that time and the formation of the AIHA and NIHL in late 2000, \"pick-up\" sessions of informal games were organized by various local and expatriate players. The Canadian Association of Singapore has also run various hockey activities over the years, most recently a comprehensive youth hockey program since at least 1997.\nThe National Ice Hockey League of Singapore and its parent body, the Amateur Ice Hockey Association (Singapore) were the brainchild of Greg Blakney, a longtime Asian and Singaporean resident. Greg had a vision of creating a comprehensive infrastructure for developing hockey in Singapore, from bringing together the top players on the island (locals and expats) to play in the NIHL, to helping recruit and develop local talent. The league has grown steadily since inception, spending many thousands of dollars on developing the sport of hockey in Singapore along the way. It has only been since the creation of the AIHA and NIHL, that Singapore has had the foundation on which to build a meaningful national ice hockey body."

        "text": "Christian Keener \"Red\" Cagle (May 1, 1905 – December 26, 1942) was an American professional football player in the National Football League (NFL). He was a three-time All-American playing college football for the Army Black Knights A star halfback, Cagle's prominence landed him on the cover of \"Time\" magazine in 1929.\nFor five seasons, running from 1930 to 1934, Cagle played professional football in the NFL. His 1932 salary with the New York Football Giants was second highest in the entire league. The following year Cagle became a co-owner of the new Brooklyn Dodgers NFL franchise, for which he also played, selling his stake upon his retirement in 1934.\nCagle was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.\nCollege career.\nCagle first starred at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then named Southwestern Louisiana Institute or SLI) from 1922 to 1925, where he earned a degree in arts and sciences. In his career at Southwestern Louisiana, he scored 235 points from touchdowns, extra points and field goals, a school record that lasted until 1989. His time at Southwestern Louisiana has him placed among the all-time greats of early Southern football. Besides being the football captain (1925), he also was a star in basketball and track and field sports at Southwestern Louisiana, where he received a degree in arts and sciences.\nCagle then played football for four years in the Army football team at the United States Military Academy, from 1926 to 1929, but did not graduate because he had secretly married in August 1928 in violation of academy rules. He was forced to resign in May 1930. Known as the \"Red Thunderbolt of West Point,\" he was an All-American halfback for the last three years. His longest runs were 75 yards against Yale, 1928; 70 yards against Ohio Wesleyan, and 65 yards against Yale, 1929. In four years at Army he scored 169 points, averaged 6.4 yards per attempt in rushing and 26.4 yards on kickoff returns.\nAs the team captain in 1929, he was featured on the September 23 cover of \"Time\" magazine of that same year. Cagle was noted for playing with the chin strap loose from his helmet, and sometimes without helmet. Sportswriters liked to refer to him as \"Onward Christian\" because of his ability to advance the ball.\nProfessional career.\nCagle played professional football for five seasons, including the New York Giants from 1930 to 1932. During his final year with the Giants Cagel was the highest paid member of the team, earning a handsome $500 per game — second in the entire league to the $550 per game earned by superstar halfback Red Grange of the Chicago Bears.\nIn 1933, he and fellow former New York Giants player John Simms Kelly became co-owners of the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers franchise. Cagle played for the team in 1933 and 1934. Dan Topping bought Cagle's half of the team in 1934.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in Merryville, Louisiana, he was one of eight children, including five brothers and two sisters. Cagle was named after an uncle, who in turn was named after the late Bishop Christian Keener of the Methodist church. He attended high school in Merryville, a small community about 20 miles (30 km) southwest of De Ridder. According to local legend, he was known for getting off the school bus and racing it to school, a race that he quite often won. The football field at Merryville High School is named Keener Cagle Field in his honor.\nHe secretly married Marian Haile in 1928 after meeting her at Louisiana-Lafayette.\nCagle died in 1942, at 37 years of age, from a peculiar mishap the day after Christmas (December 26). He was believed to have tripped down a flight of stairs at the Fulton Street station of the New York City Subway on December 23. According to \"The Advertiser\" report, \"Cagle tripped and fell the full length of a flight of subway steps.\" He died three days later of a fractured skull. At the time of his death he had lived in a Queens apartment house with his wife and was employed by an insurance company."

Butler had first commentated alongside veteran Bill McLaren and after McClaren's retirement Butler became the BBC's lead Rugby Union commentator.\nHe received some attention when it became public knowledge that Austin Healey's newspaper column had been written by Butler whilst Healey was on tour with the British and Irish Lions Rugby squad in Australia in 2001.\nBefore commentating on a match, Butler prepared for several hours, absorbing as much information as he could, but taking few notes, and likened it to cramming for an examination. He described writing a match report, often under time pressure, as telling a story which does not necessarily have to follow the timeline of the match so long as it is entertaining and complete.\nIn 2008 Butler provided commentary for archery at the Beijing Olympics.\nButler presented the history series: \"Wales and the History of the World\" (BBC1 Wales), \"Hidden Histories\" (BBC2), \"Welsh Towns at War\" (BBC1) in 2014 and two series of \"Welsh Towns\" (BBC2 Wales) in 2015. He was on the commentating team for the Invictus Games. He also worked on association football assignments, including a special interview with Eric Cantona for an FA Cup Final edition of Grandstand in 1994.\nWriting, charity work and politics.\nButler published several novels, including two based on rugby. He was also an ambassador for Prostate Cymru, a Welsh organisation to raise prostate cancer awareness.\nButler was a supporter of Welsh independence and spoke at a pro independence march in Merthyr Tydfil organised by YesCymru and AUOB Cymru on 7 September 2019.\nPersonal life and death.\nButler was married to Susan at the time of his death and had six children.\nButler actively joined fundraising efforts for both Prostate Cymru and the Velindre Cancer Centre. On 15 September 2022, whilst taking part with 25 other Prostate Cymru charity walkers, including his daughter Nell, on the Inca Trail Trek to Machu Picchu, Peru, Butler died peacefully in his sleep at Ecoinka base camp near Cusco in the Andes. He was 65."

        "text": "Eric Blake Owens (born February 3, 1971) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. He played for five Major League Baseball (MLB) teams from 1995 through 2003.\nCareer.\nOwens was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth round of the 1992 MLB draft out of Ferrum College, where he played baseball and football. As a ballplayer, he led his team into the NCAA Regionals three times and was named to the All-America first team in 1991 and 1992, including a pair of South Regional runner-up finishes in both seasons, while earning Dixie Conference Player of the Year honors in 1992.\nOwens left Ferrum the owner of seven school records, including marks for career batting average (.430), stolen bases (68) and triples (18), while batting over .400 in each of his three college seasons.\nOwens made his MLB debut with the Reds in 1995, playing with them for three seasons before joining the Milwaukee Brewers (1998), San Diego Padres (1999–2000), Florida Marlins (2001–2002) and Anaheim Angels (2003).\nOn July 15, 1999, Owens became the first player to collect a hit at Safeco Field, lining the sixth pitch of the game from Seattle Mariners starter Jamie Moyer into shallow right field during an interleague game.\nThe Padres traded Owens to the Marlins prior to the 2001 season in a five-player deal that included Matt Clement and a minor leaguer in exchange for César Crespo and Mark Kotsay.\nAdditionally, Owens played in the Minor Leagues in all or parts of 10 seasons spanning 1992–2005, including stints with the Toledo Mud Hens of the Detroit Tigers organization in 2004 and the Mexican League in 2005.

        "title": "Motocross Maniacs",
        "text": " is a platform racing video game released in 1989 by Konami, for the Game Boy handheld.\nSummary.\nThe player controls a motorcycle moving one way horizontally, much like Nintendo's \"Excitebike\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System. When a level has been completed within its time limit, the player starts on the next.\nWith only eight different levels and fairly simple gameplay, the game's complexity is not too different from other Game Boy games released around the introduction of the system. Despite this, \"Motocross Maniacs\" requires quite some skill to master. Additionally, the game provides replay value by letting the player beat previous time records, which are announced at the completion of a level. The game's cartridge, however, does not retain these records after the Game Boy is turned off.\nTwo sequels were released, \"Motocross Maniacs 2\" for the Game Boy Color and \"Motocross Maniacs Advance\" for the Game Boy Advance. \"Motocross Maniacs 2\" is largely similar to the original, aside from the addition of championship mode where the player competes against computer-controlled racers. \"Motocross Maniacs Advance\", however, did introduce major changes and more features, including revamped graphics, selectable characters, and newly-designed 2.5D levels.\nGameplay.\nThe player's control over the motorcycle allows moving the front wheel upwards or downwards, allowing for jumps over obstacles and rotating stunts when in the air. If the player lands incorrectly, the rider will fall off the bike and climb back on it. This is a main cause of time loss in the game.\nThe bike is provided with only limited fuel (represented as \"TIME\" bar), and the player must complete the course before running out of fuel. The game ends when the time limit is depleted.\nThe bike also has the ability to use nitrous oxide for a short speed boost. This allows for large jumps and can be necessary for making loops.\nNitrous power-ups can be obtained within a level (marked as a large \"N\"), but often they will require one to be used to get them in the first place. Thus when the player has depleted his supply, it can be very hard or even impossible to regain more boosts. Furthermore, some levels have sections that require one or more boosts to pass, making it nearly impossible to complete the level without any.\nOther power-ups in the game include extra fuel (marked as \"T\"), increased speed (marked as \"S\", continues until the player crashes) and enhanced traction (marked as \"R\", also continues until the player crashes).\nThe player can also perform combos by making frontflips and backflips, and consecutive combos grants the player a flying booster (represented by \"JET\") that allows the bike to jump up high if several boosts are used.\nMany levels offer multiple directions for the player. One usually contains extra power-ups and requires the use of boosts and agility to successfully traverse, while the other simply requires jumping obstacles on the ground, often including loose sand and gravel that will slow down the motorcycle.\nModes.\nThere are eight different levels, which become harder to complete as they progress. Any level can be selected from the beginning of the game, together with an A, B or C difficulty level which determines the time available to complete the level.\nThe game has three different modes of play:\nFor the two versus modes, the second player appears as a silhouette behind the player, similar to time trials in other racing games.\nReception.\nIn 2019, PC Magazine included MotoCross Maniacs in their \"The 10 Best Game Boy Games\" writing: \"Simple yet deep gameplay will keep you coming back for more in this timeless motorsports title.\""

        "title": "American Football Ireland",
        "text": "American Football Ireland (AFI) is the National Governing Body for American football for the island of Ireland. Founded in 1984 the AFI is entirely volunteer run and all American football played in Ireland is played at an amateur level.\nHistory.\n1980s and 1990s.\nThe first Shamrock Bowl game was played in 1986 between the Craigavon Cowboys and the Dublin Celts. The Cowboys won the first title played in Dublin. The Celts then went on to be the number 1 team in Ireland for the next 10 years, winning the Shamrock Bowl 5 times. \nThe Celts were also the First Irish team to represent Ireland in the Euro Bowl – the then Champions league of European American Football.\n2000s.\nDuring 2000, plans were made to resurrect the IAFL. The only fixture to be played in Ireland that year was an Irish selection against a visiting high school team – Mount St. Josephs from Maryland USA. In 2001, the Carrickfergus Knights, Dublin Dragons, Dublin Rebels and University of Limerick Vikings played a full league season of football. The Dublin Rebels defeated the Carrickfergus Knights in Shamrock Bowl XV, which was played in Carrickfergus.\nAll four teams participated in the reformation of the Irish American Football League (IAFL). A new league structure and administration was put in place and the IAFL helped form the Irish American Football Association (IAFA) – the new national governing body for the sport. During 2002, the sport found a new lease on life in Ireland. Again, four teams contested the league with the Carrickfergus Knights defeating the UL Vikings in Shamrock Bowl XVI. However, during the course of the year there were some significant developments. Firstly, three development teams applied to join the league for 2003. Secondly, an Irish team won an International club competition for the first time ever. In June, the Dublin Rebels travelled to Belgium and won the Charleroi Trophy against the Charleroi Cougars and two French teams – Reims Champs and Forbach Taupes. The season finished on a high note with the visit of Team Canada, the Canadian U21 team. The Carrickfergus Knights played Team Canada in Dublin and performed well in a 34–6 defeat.\n2003 turned out to be one of the best years ever for Irish American football. Three more teams – Cork, Belfast &amp; Craigavon – joined the IAFL bringing the total up to seven. The Carrickfergus Knights, Cork Admirals, Dublin Dragons and Dublin Rebels played in Division 1. The Belfast Bulls, Craigavon Cowboys and UL Vikings played in Division 2 which was created to help development teams get competitive game experience.\nMembership in the IAFL increased significantly and the standard of play was higher than in previous years. In June 2003, the Dublin Rebels returned to Belgium to defend their Charleroi Trophy title. They were joined in Belgium by the Carrickfergus Knights. The Rebels won the Charleroi Trophy, defeating local team, the Charleroi Cougars in the Tournament final. The Knights came third, ahead of French team, Celtes de Mitry.\nThe Knights finished first in the league to qualify for the Shamrock Bowl. The Rebels beat the Cork Admirals in the semi-final and then defeated the Knights 24–12 in a spectacular Shamrock Bowl XVII, played at Suttonians RFC in Dublin. The game attracted a large crowd and some media attention – highlights were broadcast on TV3 in Ireland and Sky Sports throughout Europe. The Belfast Bulls won the Division 2 title. The season finished with the first ever IAFL Allstar game in which the North defeated the South 7–0.\nDuring the 2003–2004 off-season, Coach Phil DeMonte (ex-Oxford University Cavaliers) was appointed as the head coach of the Irish National Team and IAFL Allstars. Coach DeMonte will also help with the education of coaches throughout Ireland. 2004 promised to be the best season ever for Irish American football both on and off the field and did not fail to deliver. 6 teams played a full competitive league schedule and the standard of play was higher than at any time in the previous 10 years. IAFL membership reached an all-time high of more than 300 registered players. All teams had bigger rosters and most of the rookies were in the 17–21 age group. The Dublin Rebels defeated the Carrickfergus Knights 24–22 in Shamrock Bowl XVIII. The game, which attracted a record attendance for an IAFL game, is regarded as the best ever Shamrock Bowl. 2004 also saw the return of the Ireland team. The team played two fixtures including the inaugural Celtic Classic against John Carroll University from Ohio, USA.\nIn 2005 the same six teams competed for the Shamrock Bowl. Again the Rebels ran out victorious with a tough fought win against the Belfast Bulls in the big game.\nThe 2006 season saw the addition of new teams the DCU Saints and Dublin Marshals to the IAFL making the total number of competing teams, 8, the highest it had been in many years. The UL Vikings faced the Rebels in the Bowl game, which the Rebels won, making it their fourth consecutive Shamrock Bowl win.\nThe 2007 season was contested by nine teams, following the addition of the Belfast Trojans and the Tallaght Outlaws to the league. The 2007 Shamrock Bowl was won by UL Vikings.\nAfter the 2008 season, the Tallaght Outlaws decided to stop playing in the league, after playing two full seasons in the league.\nStructure.\nAFI oversee the administration of 3 codes:\nWithin the Senior American Football code, there are 3 separate divisions:\nThe Youth American Football section expands year on year, with a record 7 teams competing for the AFI Youth Plate in 2019. The Cork Admirals are the current champions.\nThe Flag Football section is split into 2 separate conferences:\nThe Premier Division consists of eight senior teams. For the 2021 Season, the Premier Division will consist of:\nTeams.\nThe League consists of three tiers of football, starting with the Premier Division, also known as the SBC. Below are the IAFL 1 and IAFL 2 divisions. The 2019 season was the last year the League ran due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults.\n2006 season.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nLeague Table\n2007 season.\nFormat\nIn 2007, to cope with the growing number of teams, a divisional format was introduced to replace the old league format. In it, the existing teams were divided into three divisions, Northern, Central and Southern, three teams in each. The idea of the divisional format is that any new teams, such as the up-coming development teams, will easily fit into the divisional format without dramatically increasing the length of the season, which currently runs from February/March to Early August. The top team from each division all go into the play-offs and the two second placed teams, with the highest numbers of points, playing a wildcard game for the 4th spot. The winners of the playoffs battle it out for the Shamrock Bowl.\nThe 2007 IAFL season, complete with new divisional format was due to begin on 4 March with the College Championship game between DCU Saints and UL Vikings, but the game was delayed due to rain, so the season proper began on 25 March when the Cork Admirals beat the Belfast Bulls, the UL Vikings beat the Tallaght Outlaws and Dublin Rebels (then Shamrock Bowl Holders) beat the DCU Saints. The season continued throughout April and May, with the IAFL College Championship Game eventually been rescheduled on 3 June, with the UL Vikings beating the DCU Saints 50–2.\nDuring the course of the regular season, two non-league games were played against foreign opposition, with CMS College Stags beating the Tallaght Outlaws 67–0 and, in the Claddagh Classic on 2 June, the Team USA All-Stars beat the Carrickfergus Knights 26–0.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNorthern Division\nCentral Division\nSouthern Division\nThe play-off positions were decided on the last day of the regular season, with the Belfast Bulls, Dublin Rebels and UL Vikings securing their respective Divisional titles and the Belfast Trojans and Cork Admirals as the wildcard teams. Cork Admirals won the wildcard game and set up a play-off tie with the Dublin Rebels, strongly fancied to retain the Shamrock Bowl for the 5th consecutive time. However, Cork managed to win a close fought 8–6 victory and secured their first ever bowl appearance against UL Vikings, who beat the Belfast Bulls 44–2 to set the stage for the first ever all-Munster Shamrock Bowl. The UL Vikings won a close game 22–14 to win Shamrock Bowl XXI and claim their first ever title.\n2008 season.\nAn AGM held on 25 November decided the format for the 2008 season. It was decided to gradually phase out under 18 kitted players and start a junior (i.e. 16–18 age group) league. It was also decided to run a DV-8's league, where development teams and entrants from already established teams can field rookies in 8 a side matches. This would also help teams who are just starting out to get some playing time and reduce the pressure to find new players, which has plagued new IAFL teams in the past.\nIt was decided to keep the league format the same. The same teams will compete in the same divisions, with the exception of the Dublin Rhinos, a spin-off from the Dublin Dragons, who will replace the Dragons in the IAFL Central. The league for 2008 looks like this.\nThe Development League (DV8) consists of the following teams.\n2009 season.\nIt was decided to continue running the DV-8's league, where development teams could learn and improve on the basics of football in a competitive league setting. This would also help teams who are just starting out to get some playing time and reduce the pressure to find new players, which has plagued new IAFL teams in the past.\nThe IAFL format was changed to a single division rather than the previous North, South and Central divisions in which each team would play eight matches, seeded to make the league more competitive. the top four teams would go to the playoffs in which the number 1 seeded team would face the number 4 seeded team, and the number 2 seeded team would face the number 2 seeded team. both winners would then play in the shamrock bowl. the league looks like this:\nThe Development League (DV8) consists of the following teams.\n2010 season.\nThe 2010 IAFL season, has returned to the divisional format. There are now an unprecedented number of teams competing in this fast growing league with a total of 11 teams taking part in the senior IAFL and 3 teams plus a number of rookie teams provided by some of the larger senior teams in the DV-8's. The league format will look like this:\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNorthern Division\nCentral Division\nSouthern Division\nDV8's\n2012 season.\nThis years IAFL will be contested by a record 11 teams. The Tullamore Phoenix step up from DV8s level to join the ten sides who contested the 2011 season. The regular will start in late February, which is earlier than in previous years. It will conclude on 10 June. The playoffs and Shamrock Bowl will take place from mid June to mid July.\nThe big change this year is that the structure has been changed from 3 regional divisions to 2 regional divisions – IAFL North and IAFL South. These divisions will have 5 and 6 teams respectively as opposed to either 3 or 4 under last years format. This change gives a better balance between the divisions. Consequently, there will be some changes to the playoff structure. The top team in each division will host a Semi-Final. Each 3rd placed team will travel to the 2nd placed team in their division in the Wildcard round.\nAs with last year, each team will play 8 regular season games. Most teams will play all the teams in their division once and a selection of teams in the other division. This is a change from last years format whereby teams played home and away against all divisional opponents. However, the change gives teams a greater variety of opponents as well more common opponents.\nThere are 4 doubleheaders scheduled for the upcoming season where four teams will play at one venue on the same day. Each of these should be great day out for IAFL supporters.\nThe schedule and divisional standings can be found below. Please note that there are a small number confirmations to be made, so please check this site regularly for updates. One of these confirmations is the annual Colours match between Trinity College and UCD.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNorth\nSouth\n2013 season.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNorth\nSouth\n2014 season.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNorth\nSouth\n2015 season.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNorth\nSouth\n2016 season.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNorth\nSouth\n2016 Playoffs.\nShamrock Bowl Preview\nShamrock Bowl Results"

        "text": "Randy J. Walker (May 29, 1954 – June 29, 2006) was an American college football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Miami University from 1990 to 1998 and at Northwestern University from 1999 to 2005, compiling a career head coaching record of 96–81–5. Walker won 59 games at Miami, more than noted coaches who preceded him such as Sid Gillman, Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, Bill Mallory, and Ara Parseghian.\nPlaying career.\nWalker had a standout season his last year in high school for the Troy Trojans in Troy, Ohio. He received recruiting offers from Big Ten schools like Northwestern University and Ohio State University, but choose instead to follow his high school sweetheart, Tammy, to Miami University (Tammy was a year older and already there).\nHe played three seasons at fullback for the Miami Redskins in Oxford under head coaches Bill Mallory and Dick Crum. His teammates included former Illinois coach Ron Zook and NFL standouts Rob Carpenter and Sherman Smith.\nIn his three years the team went 32–1–1 and was ranked #15 in 1973, #10 in 1974 and #12 in 1975. Miami won the Mid-American Conference in all three years. Miami also went to the Tangerine Bowl (presently the Capital One Bowl) where they beat Florida in 1973, Georgia in 1974 and South Carolina in 1975. In his senior year Walker was named the team's most valuable player. For his career he ran for 1757 yards.\nHe was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals (1976; 13th round), but chose to become an assistant coach instead.\nCoaching career.\nWalker was an assistant coach for the Miami Redskins (1976–1977; running backs), then the University of North Carolina Tar Heels (running backs coach 1978–1981; quarterbacks coach 1982–1985; offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach 1985–1987), and finally the Northwestern Wildcats (1988–1989; running backs).\nMiami.\nWalker became Miami's 30th head coach, succeeding Tim Rose whose contract was not renewed. In his first year the Redskins posted a 5–5–1 record, which was a vast improvement for a team that had only won two games in the two previous years. Walker made steady improvement in his nine years, culminating with a 10–1 record in his last year with the RedHawks. This team was led by record-breaking running back Travis Prentice. Walker finished with 59–35–5 record including several victories over ranked opponents from major conference such as #25 Northwestern in 1995, #12 Virginia Tech in 1997 and #12 North Carolina in 1998. However, he never won the Mid-American Conference Championship.\nNorthwestern.\nWalker had a 37–46 career record at Northwestern. In 2000, Walker overhauled the offense and introduced the spread formation. Unlike most other spread offenses, Walker's featured a very strong running game. His run game was so strong, in fact, that only one season in Walker's entire time at Northwestern did he fail to coach a 1000-yard rusher. This offense helped the Wildcats share the Big Ten title in his second year. He is third behind Pappy Waldorf in career victories. Walker also was the first Wildcat coach to lead three different teams to bowl games. In addition, he became the first Wildcat coach ever to guide three straight teams to four or more Big Ten wins.\nDeath.\nOn June 29, 2006, Walker, who was only 52, died suddenly of an apparent heart attack, leaving the Northwestern community shocked and saddened. He had battled a viral heart infection in the fall of 2004. On July 7, 2006 Pat Fitzgerald was named to replace him as head coach of the Wildcats. \nPersonal life.\nBorn to Jim Walker, an accountant with Hobart Corporation, and Ruth Ann Walker, he grew up in Troy, Ohio and graduated from Troy High School, where he played fullback and defensive back on the 1971 team that was picked by the \"Dayton Daily News\" as the area's best team over the past 50 years. As a student, he sang the lead in school musicals (including Tevye in \"Fiddler on the Roof\"), played the violin, and was active in student government. He graduated from Miami University in 1976 with a B.A. in social studies education and, in 1981, earned his master's degree in education administration.\nHe is survived by his wife and high-school sweetheart, Tammy (aka \"Tamara\"; née Weikert), and two children, daughter Abbey and son Jamie.\nHe met Tammy when he was on student council his junior year in high school. They were both put on a committee to plan a Thanksgiving dance in 1970. She was a senior and after she chose to attend Miami University he followed her there. They were married in 1975.\nIn an interview in 2000, Walker told Skip Myslenski of the \"Chicago Tribune\" that the defining moment in his life came in 1969. On a high school team that was rebuilding and led by undersized sophomores like himself, they were having a terrible season (they went 2–7–1). On the last play of the last game of the season, with the game tied 22–22 against powerful rival Dayton Wayne, the pass went to the 165-pound Walker. He was tackled 18 inches from the end zone. After the game his coach, James \"Jim\" Conard, made the entire team walk around with a piece of cloth that was 18 inches long, until the start of the 1970 season.\nWalker gave up his first love, baseball, joined the track team for speed and stamina, and started lifting weights, gaining 30 pounds. Reporting to fall practice at 195 pounds, Walker's teams would not lose another game the remaining two seasons, going 20–0.\nReferences.\n "

Following a hiatus after the 1957 World Professional Match-play Championship, the event was revived by Rex Williams on a challenge basis, with the champion being opposed by prominent players. This began in 1964, organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council. The 1957 champion John Pulman contested and won all seven challenge matches against various opponents in the next five years, until the tournament reverted to a knock-out format in 1969.\nEach match was played over differing lengths and locations, with some being played over a series of matches rather than . Three of the matches were played at the Burroughes Hall in London, England; two across South Africa; one in St George's Hall, Liverpool, and the final match in Bolton. The highest made over the series was a 142 made by Williams in the 25–22 match loss to Pulman.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport's origin dates to the late 19th century and British Army soldiers stationed in India. Snooker gained in popularity in across the British Isles. The championship had traditionally been played as a single-elimination tournament annually since 1927 with a hiatus during between 1940 and 1946. Known as the World Professional Match-play Championship in 1957 the event failed to generate interest from the top professional players, with defending champion Fred Davis failing to enter. The event was won by John Pulman, but with waning interest and the highest ranked players not playing the event was not held after 1957.\nEnglish player Rex Williams ran a four player tournament in Blackheath in 1964, the first commercially sponsored professional snooker event since 1960. This and taking Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC) chairman Harold Phillips out to lunch led to the BA&amp;CC allowing Williams to run a revival of the World Snooker Championship. The championship would be defended on a challenge basis, with defending champion Pulman facing a prominent snooker professional. The winner of the match would then become the new champion. The agreement between the BA&amp;CC and the players in 1964 stated that there should be a minimum side stake of £50 involved, that matches could be of any duration agreed by both participants and that the challenger would be responsible for finding a suitable venue.\nSummary.\n1964.\nThe World Snooker Championship was revived in 1964 with a match between 40-year-old John Pulman and 50-year-old Fred Davis. It was a best-of-37 match, played over three days from 20 to 22 April at Burroughes Hall in London, England. Davis had won the official championship three times and the World Professional Match-play Championship five times. He had not taken part in the last championship in 1957, which Pulman had won. Pulman took an early 4–2 lead, but Davis was ahead 7–5 at the end of the first day and maintained his two-frame advantage after the second day, leading 13–11. Davis made a break of 108 on the afternoon of the final day, but Pulman won four of the six frames in the session to level the match at 15–15. He then won the first three frames of the evening session to lead 18–15 and, although Davis won the next frame, Pulman took the fifth to win the title 19–16.\nSix months after winning the first challenge match, John Pulman was challenged by organiser Rex Williams in another match held at Burroughes Hall. This consisted of a best-of-73 frames match played over six days, from 12 to 17 October 1964. Williams led 8–4 at the end of the first day, but Pulman won 11 of the 12 frames on the second day to go ahead 15–9, extending his lead to 31–17 after four days. Pulman won the match on the fifth day with a 37–23 winning lead, making a break of 109 in frame 57. The remaining 13 were played on the final day with Pulman finishing 40–33 ahead.\nMarch 1965.\nFred Davis challenged John Pulman for the world title in March 1965. The match was again 73 frames long, played over six days from 15 to 21 March at Burroughes Hall in London. The two players were closely matched throughout. Davis led 7–5 after the first day, but Pulman had taken the lead 13–11 by the end of the second day and pulled further ahead on the third, before Davis recovered to level the match at 18–18. Pulman made a break of 100 on the fourth day; they won six frames apiece to level the score once again at 24–24. The pair were still tied after the fifth day at 30–30, with Davis making a break of 105. Pulman eventually won the match 37–36.\nSouth Africa matches.\nIn September 1965, John Pulman and Rex Williams left England to play a series of 51 seven-frame matches in South Africa for the World Championship. The number of matches was later reduced to 49 and in December Pulman took a winning lead of 25–20 to retain the title. Eventually only 47 matches were played, with Pulman winning the series 25–22. In the 24th match of the series, played in November in the South African city of East London, Williams compiled a break of 142, breaking the official tournament record of 136 set by Joe Davis in 1946. Although equalled by Bill Werbeniuk in 1979, this remained the highest break at the World Championship until Doug Mountjoy compiled a 145 in the 1981 tournament.\nAfter winning this series of matches, Pulman played South African Fred Van Rensburg in December 1965, winning the match 39–12. The winner of the June 1965 South African Professional Championship was supposed to be given the opportunity to challenge for the world title, with that match being sponsored by brandy company Richelieu et Cie. Although Perrie Mans defeated Van Rensburg 13–11 in the final, it was Van Rensberg who was given the opportunity. This decision was unpopular and contributed to a lack of coverage in the South African press of the match. Little is known about the match, except that Pulman led 9–1, 15–5 and 24–6 on his way to victory. In January 1966, Pulman and Williams played a five-day 35-frame match against Van Rensburg and amateur Manuel Francisco, taking a winning 18–7 lead on the fourth day; the match ending 24–11.\nApril 1966 matches.\nDavis met John Pulman for a third challenge in April 1966, in a series of matches promoted by the Lancashire Billiard Traders' Association. There were seven best-of-five frame matches with the player who won four matches winning the championship. The matches were all played in the concert room of St George's Hall, Liverpool from 18 to 23 April. Pulman won the first three matches, 3–2, 4–1 and 4–1, with Davis winning the fourth and fifth matches 3–2. On 22 April Pulman achieved victory by winning the sixth match, 4–2. He won the last match the following day to finish with five wins to Davis's two.\nMarch 1968.\nAustralian player Eddie Charlton challenged John Pulman in Bolton for a 73-frame match played from 4 to 9 March 1968. Pulman won the opening frame with a break of 77, but was 2–4 in arrears at the end of the first session. Charlton then extended the lead to 6–2, before Pulman won four consecutive frames to level at 6–6 by the end of the opening day's play. Pulman also won the first three frames on the second day, with Charlton taking the following two. The pair each took two of the next four frames as the score went from Pulman 9–8 ahead to 13–11 ahead at the end of the second day. In the 21st frame, after Pulman had potted the first red, Charlton potted the 14 remaining reds, with seven blacks, six pinks and a green, and then all the colours except the black, for a break of 122.\nOn the third day, Charlton won five of the six frames in the afternoon session to lead 16–14. In the evening session, Pulman drew level at 16–16. Charlton won the 33rd frame, and looked likely to win the 34th as well after making a break of 52, but Pulman eventually won the frame on the black. Pulman then won the last two frame of the day, with the last frame of the day also being decided on the final black, meaning that Pulman retained a 19–17 lead after the third day. Pulman won five of six frames in the afternoon session of the fourth day, and four of six in the evening session, with his good safety play often leading to Charlton leaving him good opportunities, and so extended his lead to 28–20 after the fourth day. With the players both winning six frames on the fifth day, it ended with Pulman leading 34–26, needing three of the remaining 13 frames. Pulman won three of the first five frames on the final afternoon to win the match 37–28. The remaining eight dead frames were played, the final score being 39–34.\nThis was the last challenge match, as the event reverted to a traditional tournament for the 1969 World Snooker Championship, and except for a round-robin stage at the 1971 World Snooker Championship, the event has been played as a single-elimination tournament since. Pulman had been touring snooker clubs as promotional work for the tobacco brand John Player, and the company had sponsored his match against Charlton. The good attendances for the challenge match led to John Player deciding to sponsor the 1969 World Snooker Championship as a knockout tournament."

        "text": "Peter John Lee (born January 2, 1956) is an English-born Canadian professional ice hockey manager and former professional ice hockey player. He played 431 National Hockey League games with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lee has been serving as CEO of Eisbären Berlin of Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga since 2005.\nEarly life.\nLee was born in Ellesmere, England, United Kingdom, and raised in Arvida, Quebec. As a youth, he learned to skate on the outdoor surface of Arvida's Powell Park, and later played for that town's Pee-Wee Orioles minor ice hockey. He played in the 1967, 1968 and 1969 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the Orioles. The family moved to Ottawa in his mid-teen years.\nPlaying career.\nLee was recruited along with his brother David by the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He enjoyed a stellar junior career with the Ottawa 67's, where he became one of the few junior players to record more than 400 career points. He was awarded CHL Player of the Year in 1975–76. He set the OHL career scoring record with 213 career goals—a record that lasted for 33 years, until March 8, 2009, when John Tavares scored his 214th to surpass Lee.\nAfter setting a new league record with 81 goals in 1975–76, Lee was chosen in the first round of the 1976 NHL Entry Draft (12th overall) by the Montreal Canadiens. Though he would spend two seasons with their farm team, the Nova Scotia Voyageurs, Lee never played for the Canadiens. On November 29, 1977, Montreal traded Lee, along with Peter Mahovlich, to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for emerging star Pierre Larouche and the rights to forward Peter Marsh.\nLee was a fine offensive addition to the Pens and was a key playmaker on the powerplay. He reached the 30-goal mark twice and scored a personal best 64 points in 1980–81 playing on a line with Greg Malone and Rod Schutt. Unfortunately, the Penguins were not a successful team at that time, and Lee only played 19 playoff games during his five and a half years with the organization. He finished his NHL career with 245 points in 431 games.\nFollowing the 1982–83 season, Lee left North America to play for Düsseldorfer EG of Germany. He scored 340 goals in 450 matches with the club before retiring in 1997.\nLee was inducted into the German Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in 2008.\nCoaching and managing career.\nLee replaced legendary coach Brian Kilrea behind the Ottawa 67's bench in 1994–95, but a dismal performance by the team prompted Kilrea to return and replace him for the 1995–96 campaign. He would return to Germany the following season and briefly resurrected his playing career.\nLee served as head coach of Eisbären Berlin from December 1997 until January 2000. He then was the manager of the club and got promoted to CEO in 2005. In 2008 and 2010 he received \"Eishockey News DEL Manager of the Year\" honours. During the 2006 Olympic Games in Torino, Lee served as an assistant coach of the Swiss National Team.\nFamily.\nHe is the son of professional soccer player Eric Lee who competed for Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics and a cousin of comedian Bob Mills"

The 60-lap race was the eighth round of the 2006 Formula One season.\nTicket sales were rather slow; the race was scheduled far earlier than normal, and local Jenson Button had a rather poor season the previous year. When the race sold out in 2005, Button had been coming off one of his best years. Also, the weekend clashed with England's first World Cup game. Jacques Villeneuve and Juan Pablo Montoya both scored their final World Championship points by finishing in eighth and sixth respectively.\nButton had a very poor qualifying run and started the race 19th; after a blinding first few laps, Jenson's engine caught fire on lap 9, due to an oil leak that also caused the car to spin out of the race. Scotsman David Coulthard also had a poor race suffering from understeer.\nFernando Alonso became the first Spanish driver and the youngest driver (24 years and 317 days) to get a hat trick (pole position, winning and fastest lap in the same race). He fell one lap short of clinching a Grand Chelem (leading every lap, he would finally achieve this at the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix).\nThis race also featured the first ever pit stop to have involved a woman, during a Midland F1 pit stop for Tiago Monteiro, ITV-F1's then pit-lane reporter Louise Goodman was the left rear tyre changer.\nThe only other noticeable incident of the race happened on the first lap, when Scott Speed pushed Ralf Schumacher's Toyota right in the path of Mark Webber at the entrance on the Hangar Straight. Schumacher and Webber retired on the spot, while Speed crawled to the pits and drove straight into the garage at the end of lap 1.\nFriday drivers.\nThe bottom 6 teams in the 2005 Constructors' Championship and Super Aguri were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race."

        "title": "Scott Hamilton (rugby union)",
        "text": "Scott Elliot Hamilton (born 4 March 1980) is a New Zealand international rugby union player, who plays both on the wing or at fullback; he played two times for the All Blacks in 2006 and has played for the Crusaders in Super Rugby and Canterbury in the NPC. New Zealand's provincial competition. Hamilton moved to Leicester Tigers in 2008 where he played 142 games in 7 seasons winning three Premiership Rugby titles in 2009, 2010 and 2013.\nHe was a player-coach at Coventry RFC in National League 1 for the 2015–16 season and since 2016 has been a player and Director of Rugby at National 2 side Hinckley.\nCareer.\nBorn in Christchurch, New Zealand, unlike many of his peers, Hamilton did not feature in age group teams in his development years. In fact, while at school at Christchurch Boys' High School, Hamilton could not make his first XV, instead playing in the third XV. However, with his skill set, and at the end of the Crusaders and Canterbury backlines, it was considered by most rugby pundits to be a formality that he would eventually go on to higher honours – a point alluded to by his nickname FABSH (Future All Black Scott Hamilton). It was a surprise to many that it took as long as it did for him to be named in the All Black squad for the first time. He was named in the All Blacks squad to play Ireland. All Blacks coach Graham Henry said of Hamilton's All Black selection, \"We like the way he anticipates, he's got a good feel for the game in the back three. He reads the play well. He's got a huge work rate and he's deserved of selection\".\nDue to an injury to All Black wing Sitiveni Sivivatu, Hamilton was promoted from the bench of the 2006 mid-year series against Ireland, to the starting 15 for the Argentina test. This was Hamilton's All Black début, and he celebrated it by scoring a match winning try in the second half.\nHamilton signed a contract with Leicester Tigers in 2008. In his first two seasons he helped Leicester to back to back Premiership titles.\nAfter joining Coventry on loan in February 2015, Hamilton signed permanently for the 2015–16 season. Scott then joined Hinckley RFC at the start of 2016/17 season as a player/coach and played a key role in keeping the side in National 2 North at the first attempt. He rolled back the years in the final game of the season against Harrogate stepping two men and accelerating away to score only his second try of the season. Now in semi- retirement as a player, he is concentrating on his director of Rugby role at Hinckley, however he continues to make cameos off the bench including a match winning try in September 2019 against Luctonians.\nHe also plays cricket at Kibworth CC."

        "title": "2006 Monaco Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2006 Monaco Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2006) was a Formula One motor race held on 28 May 2006 at the Circuit de Monaco. The 78-lap race was the seventh round of the 2006 Formula One season. Prior to the race, Renault's Fernando Alonso had finished on the podium in all of the previous six Grands Prix, winning three of those races. His main championship rival, Michael Schumacher was looking to win the race as it would equal Ayrton Senna's record at Monaco for most wins (six).\nThe race was remembered by many people for Michael Schumacher's actions during the closing stages of the qualifying session for the race, where he stopped his car in the \"Rascasse\" corner, thus preventing his rival Fernando Alonso from attempting to improve his time. Schumacher maintained that this was an innocent mistake; his actions were deemed deliberate by the race stewards and he was demoted to the back of the grid as punishment for his actions, promoting Alonso from second to pole position. It was also remembered for Schumacher coming back from his penalty during the race to finish fifth on a circuit that is notorious for overtaking being almost impossible.\nFernando Alonso went on to win the race, his first in Monaco. Juan Pablo Montoya came second, scoring his last podium and David Coulthard took full advantage of Jarno Trulli's late hydraulic failure to finish in third, scoring Red Bull Racing's first ever podium finish and also first ever podium for Ferrari as an engine supplier for a customer team since 2003 United States Grand Prix when Sauber was a Ferrari customer team but badged as Petronas. It was also his first podium finish since the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix.\nReport.\nBackground.\nDuring the break between the Spanish Grand Prix and the Monaco Grand Prix, a test session was held at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Fernando Alonso topped the times on the first day of testing, under a tenth of a second faster than the Ferrari of Felipe Massa who was second fastest. Toyota also had a promising day testing their new car, the Toyota TF106B, with Jarno Trulli coming in third place, who was also less than a tenth of a second behind Alonso. Heikki Kovalainen in the second Renault was fourth ahead of both the McLarens of Räikkönen and Montoya. Alonso was top on day two as well, with Kovalainen second in the other Renault. Jacques Villeneuve was third in his BMW Sauber, a second slower than the Renaults. Klien, Trulli and Massa completed the top six respectively. Villeneuve got the better of the two Renaults on day three, the Canadian was over four tenths faster than his nearest rival, Heikki Kovalainen. Toyota were fastest on day four, Olivier Panis was fastest ahead of Ricardo Zonta and the two McLarens of Pedro de la Rosa and Gary Paffett.\nAs well as testing in Paul Ricard, some teams, namely Honda and Williams, were testing at an Italian circuit near Vallelunga, which had recently had a new chicane added to it to help simulate Monaco's characteristics. Honda's Anthony Davidson was top of the time sheet on day one, with Alexander Wurz's Williams around 4 tenths behind him. Honda continued to their advantage over Williams on day two of testing, with Jenson Button topping the times; Davidson was second and Mark Webber was third. Honda were fastest again on day three, this time Rubens Barrichello was fastest with Jenson Button in second and Mark Webber third. Williams were left on their own in Vallelunga on day four, Mark Webber and Narain Karthikeyan driving for Williams. The Australian was fastest with Karthikeyan around 4 tenths slower than him.\nFriday drivers.\nThe bottom 6 teams in the 2005 Constructors' Championship and Super Aguri were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.\nPractice.\nFernando Alonso showed he had intention of winning his first Monaco Grand Prix as he was fastest in the opening practice session, recording a best lap of 1:16.712, a tenth of a second faster than Honda test driver Anthony Davidson, who recorded a personal best of 1:16.872. Underlining Renault's challenge was third-fastest Giancarlo Fisichella, who was right behind Mondini, with a best time of 1:16.88.\nAlexander Wurz was fastest in the second practice session, one tenth faster than Mondini and two tenths faster than third fastest, Juan Pablo Montoya. Wurz was very pleased with his performance in practice, \"I went through my tyre choice and I have to say the way the circuit is progressing, it is coming to us just as it did at the Nürburgring, which is good. This makes me quite confident and positive that we will have a good weekend\" he said. Anthony Davidson had dislodged a marker stick in the \"\"Swimming Pool\" to cause the red flag at the start of the session. After the restart, Davidson got his entry to the \"Ste Devote\"\" corner wrong and understeered into the tyre wall, removing the Honda's front wing and left front wheel.\nAlonso was quickest in the Saturday morning session. Michael Schumacher, who had challenged Alonso all through the session, was second, 2 tenths slower than Alonso. Fisichella was third, Coulthard fourth, Nico Rosberg fifth, and Montoya sixth.\nQualifying.\nConditions were warm and sunny for the qualifying session for the race the following day, perhaps the biggest challenge for the drivers was getting a \"clear track\", meaning the drivers wanted a qualifying run without any cars in their way as this can seriously compromise a driver's time with the lack of width around the track so there was a possibility of a \"big-name\" going out before the top ten shootout. Vitantonio Liuzzi was the first driver to set a time in the session. By the time everyone, except Michael Schumacher, had set a time, Felipe Massa lost control of his Ferrari at \"Casino Square\"; so the Brazilian would start from the back of the grid and the session was red flagged. The session restarted at 1:10pm local time and Schumacher did set a time and was safely through to the second phase. Scott Speed had a good chance of qualifying for the second session, but an error at the chicane meant he was eliminated from qualifying. Rubens Barrichello made a last-ditch effort to get out of the elimination zone and did as he moved up to eighth. At the end of the first session Michael Schumacher was fastest, while Christijan Albers, Tiago Monteiro, Takuma Sato, Franck Montagny,\nScott Speed and Felipe Massa were eliminated.\nNick Heidfeld was the first to set a time in the second session before being beaten by the Renault of Fernando Alonso and McLaren's Kimi Räikkönen who would later battle for the fastest time for the remainder of the session. So the 2005 pole position man, Kimi Räikkönen, was fastest with Fernando Alonso closely behind. David Coulthard was the surprise addition to the final session in his Red Bull. Ralf Schumacher, Christian Klien, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Jenson Button, Jacques Villeneuve and Nick Heidfeld were eliminated.\nThe final qualifying session was overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's actions in the dying moments of the session as his rival, Fernando Alonso, was on a flying lap and was, at sector two, over two tenths of a second faster than the German. However, Schumacher slid into and stopped his car against the barriers in the \"Rascasse\" corner, which compromised Alonso's lap. When asked about the incident, Schumacher responded by saying that he \"locked up the front and went wide.\" The consensus in the paddock was that it was a deliberate act and the issue was raised with the race stewards. The stewards agreed and punished Schumacher by sending him to the back of the grid, alongside his teammate, making this the first time ever in the history of the sport that two Ferrari team cars would start a race on the back row. Ferrari's Managerial Director, Jean Todt, said that he was \"disgusted\" by the decision. Steward Joaquin Verdegay commented, \"He performed some absolutely unnecessary and pathetic counter-steering, and that lasted five metres, until there was no more chances of going through the turn normally. He lost control of the car while travelling at . That's something completely unjustifiable.\" Former driver Keke Rosberg said of the incident, \"It was the cheapest, dirtiest thing I have ever seen in F1. He should leave F1 and go home.\"\nSchumacher was not the only driver to be punished in qualifying; Giancarlo Fisichella was also punished by the stewards for blocking David Coulthard from improving his time and the Italian lost his three fastest lap times and dropped five places on the grid.\nRace.\nWith Schumacher starting from the back of the grid and Mark Webber between him and his closest rival, Kimi Räikkönen, Fernando Alonso was in a good position. Like the qualifying session the day before, the sun was out and was most certainly staying out for the entire race. Coming into first corner, Alonso led the Williams of Webber and the two McLarens of Räikkönen and Montoya, nearly all 22 cars escaped the first corner unscathed, only Tiago Monteiro had picked up a problem, losing his front wing after a minor collision with his teammate, Christijan Albers. By the end of lap one, Michael Schumacher had already passed Takuma Sato after starting the race from the pit lane and Alonso led the race by 8 tenths of a second from Mark Webber. The Australian ran wide at \"St Devote\" and was overtaken by Räikkönen at \"Casino Square\" during lap two and was now catching Alonso by setting the fastest lap and by lap four Räikkönen had Alonso in his sight.\nIn the mid-field, Schumacher was up in 16th place and was right behind the Honda of Jenson Button, but he would not get past Button until the 21st lap when he overtook the Briton in the Chicane. By lap 14, the leaders had already caught up with the backmarkers of the two Super Aguris and Monteiro's Midland. Albers was given a stop-and-go penalty on lap 18 for causing an avoidable collision with his teammate and took his penalty a lap later. By lap 21, the first round of pit stops had begun, Tiago Monteiro, who had already been into the pits, was the first driver to make a scheduled stop. Räikkönen was the first of the top three drivers to pit, which was on lap 22. Alonso pitted from the lead two laps later, leaving Mark Webber in the race lead. After a fast in-lap, Webber pitted from the lead and had the potential to come out ahead of Räikkönen. But he failed to come out in front of the Finnish driver and retained his position. By lap 34, Schumacher was up in 13th position, behind David Coulthard, but two laps later Schumacher came in for his first stop of the race and, with a stop of 9.1 seconds, was fueled until the end of the race.\nBy lap 46, Rubens Barrichello, who had been off pace for the entire race, pitted in for his first and only stop of the race. Webber was having a good race for Williams that afternoon, but it was to be cut short due to an exhaust failure; as the Australian completed his 48th lap, smoke started to appear at the back of his car and it blew up in flames at the exit of the pit lane. The safety car was deployed so marshals could get Webber's Williams off track so the rest of the field could resume racing without running into the immobile Williams. The entire field took advantage of the safety car period, and pitted a lap later for new tires and fuel. After two laps under the safety car, Räikkönen had bad luck as well when a heat shield, which had caught fire before in the first practice session, caught fire again, burning through the car's wiring and, judging by the on-board footage, cutting off the electricity to the engine; Räikkönen parked his McLaren at the exit of the Portier turn. Following this, the Finn opted to return to his private yacht as the race carried on.\nWith the safety car coming back into the pits, Alonso restarted in first place with Juan Pablo Montoya right behind him and Rubens Barrichello third; Coulthard and Schumacher were in the points as well. By lap 57, Alonso had a commanding lead of over 15 seconds to Montoya. Christian Klien retired a lap later, promoting his teammate David Coulthard to fifth and Michael Schumacher to sixth. Jacques Villeneuve got a drive-through penalty on lap 59 because he overtook under safety car conditions. Schumacher was closing fast on sixth-place Coulthard at about five seconds a lap, lapping in the 1:15's, but the Scot was over 35 seconds ahead of him. Barrichello, who was having a good Grand Prix up to lap 63, when he was given a drive through penalty for speeding in the pit lane; thus promoting Jarno Trulli up to third place and Coulthard to fourth. Barrichello came back in fifth place.\nWith a podium almost certain for Trulli, his Toyota team were pleased with the new car's performance but, on lap 72, the Italian had a hydraulic failure that shut the car down on the way up to the Casino, promoting Coulthard to third, who was now on course to take Red Bull's first podium, and moving Trulli's teammate, Ralf Schumacher, who had had a very quiet Grand Prix, up into the points. By lap 75 and with only a few laps to go, Michael Schumacher had closed right up on his old Ferrari teammate, Rubens Barrichello, but despite a number of attempts, Schumacher failed to get past the Honda and finished fifth. Giancarlo Fisichella was sixth in the sister Renault; Nick Heidfeld was seventh, and Ralf Schumacher took the final point up for grabs in eighth.\nOn the podium, Coulthard wore a Superman cape, given that Red Bull was in that race promoting the superhero's newest film, \"Superman Returns\". No champagne was sprayed due to death of Édouard Michelin on Friday.\nPost-race.\nSchumacher's actions in the qualifying session would serve as ammunition for Schumacher's critics to go along with his actions in the 1994 Australian Grand Prix and the 1997 European Grand Prix, although Schumacher never accepted the allegations that he \"parked\" his Ferrari on purpose to block Fernando Alonso from taking pole position off him. However, this race is also regarded as one of Schumacher's best performances owing to the immense difficulty to overtake in Monaco, which did not stop him from overtaking at least 11 cars on the narrow track.\nThe Grand Prix was also the last time that Juan Pablo Montoya stepped onto a Formula One podium as well as Red Bull Racing's first podium finish. This would also be the last Monaco Grand Prix for Montoya and Jacques Villeneuve. Michael Schumacher did not return to Monaco until the 2010 Formula One season."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks",
        "text": " \nListed below are the longest consecutive games played in Major League Baseball history. To compile such a streak, a player must appear in every game played by his team. The streak is broken if the team completes a game in which the player neither takes a turn at bat nor plays a half-inning in the field.\nThe record of playing in 2,632 consecutive games over more than 16 years is held by Cal Ripken Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles. Ripken surpassed Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees, whose record of 2,130 consecutive games had stood for 56 years. Before Gehrig, the record was held by Everett Scott (1,307 consecutive games), a shortstop with the Red Sox and Yankees whose streak ended in 1925, less than a month before Gehrig's began. Scott broke the previous record which was established by George Pinkney (577 consecutive games) from 1885 to 1890.\nThe record for a National League player is held by Steve Garvey of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres (1975–1983), though Garvey's 1,207-game streak is less than half the length of Ripken's. Previous holders of the National League record include Billy Williams of the Chicago Cubs (1963–1970), Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals (1952–1957), and Gus Suhr of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1931–1937).\nOf the top 17 streaks on this list, 9 were compiled by members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Two others are separate streaks compiled by Pete Rose, who was named one of the top 30 players of the 20th century but is banned from the Hall of Fame.\nList.\n\"Minimum 500 consecutive games played\"\nOfficial definition.\nMLB's rule 10.23(c), defining consecutive game streaks, is as follows: \"A consecutive game playing streak shall be extended if the player plays one half inning on defense, or if he completes a time at bat by reaching base or being put out. A pinch running appearance only shall not extend the streak. If a player is ejected from a game by an umpire before he can comply with the requirements of this rule, his streak shall continue.\"\nThus it is possible for a pinch-runner to enter a game and record a statistic—steal a base, be caught stealing, or score a run—without being credited with a (consecutive) game played. Indeed, Juan Pierre appeared in 821 consecutive games from 2002 to 2007, but on June 3, 2005, he was used solely as a pinch runner. Under Rule 10.23(c), this resulted in separate games-played streaks of 386 and 434 games.\nSimilarly, a fielder can field a ball in play, make a putout or an assist, and even commit an error, without being credited with a (consecutive) game played. For example, Hideki Matsui's consecutive games streak was ended when he broke his wrist diving for a ball with two outs in the first inning of the Yankee game of May 11, 2006. That game would have been #519 in his MLB streak and #1,769 in his MLB/Japan game streak (see below), but since Matsui did not play a full half inning on defense, that game is sometimes not counted in his streak. MLB and the Society for American Baseball Research both credit Matsui with having played 519 consecutive MLB games.\nStreak starts, continuations, and ends.\nLou Gehrig's streak started as a pinch-hitter. The next day he started at first base in place of slumping Wally Pipp and stayed there for fourteen years. On July 14, 1934, Gehrig, suffering from an attack of lumbago, was listed in the Yankee lineup at shortstop. He batted in the top of the first inning to preserve the streak, singled, and was promptly removed from the game. Gehrig's streak was ended by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the disease that would take his life. His physical abilities rapidly declining, Gehrig told manager Joe McCarthy to take him out of the lineup on May 2, 1939. He never played again, dying in 1941.\nGarvey's streak was ended when he dislocated his thumb in a home plate collision against the Atlanta Braves.\nScott's streak was ended when Manager Miller Huggins benched him in favor of Pee Wee Wanninger.\nRipken says that the closest he ever came to not playing during his streak was the day after he twisted his knee during a bench-clearing brawl against the Seattle Mariners in June 1993. When the 1994–95 player's strike threatened to destroy Ripken's streak as baseball owners planned to use replacement players, Baltimore owner Peter Angelos announced that the Orioles would rather not field a team than see Ripken's streak snapped. The replacement player scenario never came to pass, as the remainder of the 1994 season—including the World Series—was cancelled due to the strike. Ripken broke Gehrig's record on September 6, 1995. Ripken himself made the decision not to play on September 20, 1998, the Orioles' last home game of the season. Rookie Ryan Minor played third base for Ripken in a 5–4 loss to the Yankees. Ripken's record is considered by many to be unbreakable.\nMiguel Tejada's streak ended after Doug Brocail hit Tejada on the wrist with a pitch on June 20, 2007. During the game on June 21, Tejada took an at-bat in the top half of the first inning, bunting into a fielder's choice. He was removed from the game for a pinch runner, officially keeping the streak alive. But Tejada was then diagnosed with a broken wrist and went to the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 games.\nConsecutive innings.\nAccording to the Society for American Baseball Research, from June 5, 1982, to September 14, 1987, Cal Ripken Jr. played 8,264 consecutive innings, which is believed to be a record, although not one that is officially kept by MLB. The second-longest streak known to have occurred is 5,152 consecutive innings by George Pinkney, who mostly played in the American Association during the record-setting stretch, which lasted from 1885 to 1890.\nCombined Japanese–US streak.\nHideki Matsui assembled a consecutive games streak of 1,769 games combined between the Japanese league Yomiuri Giants and the Major league New York Yankees. If games in Japan were counted, this would place Matsui behind only Ripken and Gehrig for streaks in Major League Baseball, although other streaks that took place solely in Japan have been longer (Sachio Kinugasa's streak of 2,215 games, which was a world record until broken by Ripken, as well as Takashi Toritani's streak of 1,939 games.) The MLB portion of Matsui's streak lasted for 519 games and is an MLB record for consecutive games to start a player's career. The entire combined streak stretched from August 22, 1993, to May 10, 2006, and was ended by a wrist injury sustained during what was his 519th consecutive game (see above). The MLB portion of the streak extended from March 31, 2003 (opening day), until May 10, 2006."

        "title": "Swimming lessons",
        "text": "Swimming lessons are the process of learning to swim. In most countries there is a definition of a number of swimming levels that are reached in the process of the curriculum. The respective certificates of swimming tests are required for further training in aquatic abilities. Many countries have defined a minimum swimming level that children should reach by the end of primary education, in most cases with the help of school swimming classes being part of the normal curriculum.\nChildren are often given swimming lessons, which serve to develop swimming technique and confidence. Children were traditionally viewed not to be able to swim independently until 4 years of age,\nbut infant swimming lessons are now recommended to prevent drowning and increase water familiarality. There are many different ways of learning to swim with swimming lessons. There are community center lessons, semi-private lessons and private lessons. Swimming lessons can support children with special needs through adaptive swimming lessons.\nInfant swimming lessons.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends swimming lessons for children from 1–4, along with other precautionary measures to prevent drowning. In 2010, the American Academy of Pediatrics reversed its previous position in which it had disapproved of lessons before age 4, indicating that the evidence no longer supported an advisory against early swimming lessons.\nThere is an essential difference between the new infant swimming lessons and the traditional parent-child water play sessions. Infant swimming lessons, sometimes called infant swim recovery, teach infants and toddlers how to recover from an accidental fall into a body of water. Unlike traditional parent/toddler classes, which encourage the child's face in the water through blowing bubbles, infant swimming lessons instill in the child the skills to regain buoyancy from a submerged state and to tilt the head back, getting it out of the water to take breaths and cry for help. Children ages one to six-years-old learn advanced safety skills to roll to their backs to take a breath and then to roll back to their stomachs to continue swimming. \nSwimming lessons reduce the risk of drowning by 88% for babies and children up to 4 years old.\nSchool swimming.\nIn many locations, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies. Many schools also include swimming lessons into their physical education (PE) curricula, provided either in the schools' own pools, another school's pool, or in the nearest public pool.\nThe Department for Education in England includes learning to swim as a compulsory element in primary school PE curriculum. According to the department's website, at the end of year 6 (age 11), all children \"should be taught to...swim 25 metres\" (front and back) and demonstrate an understanding of water safety. Schools can decide when and where pupils will learn to swim. Many children in the UK learn to swim in lessons that are not provided by their primary school and can swim 25 meters by the age of 6. The National Governing body for Swimming is Swim England who train and accredit 80% of swimming teachers in England and Wales * [Ofqual statistics 2012-17] Advocates for school swimming lessons in the United States frequently cite the CDC estimate that 34% of 80%American adults are unable to swim 24 yards.\nIn Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, the curriculum for 11-year-olds in the fifth grade states that all children should learn how to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water. Most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim —of which at least is on their back—after first falling into deep water and submerging their head underwater. Even though about 95 percent of Swedish schoolchildren know how to swim, drowning remains the third-most common cause of death among children.\nIn both the Netherlands and Belgium, swimming lessons during school time (\"schoolzwemmen\", or school swimming) are supported by the government. Most schools provide swimming lessons. There is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the Netherlands and in Belgium; the Dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is \"schoolslag\" (schoolstroke). The children learn a variant of the breaststroke. In recent years however, most Dutch towns have abolished school swimming in order to cut expenses.\nIn Germany and Austria, school swimming (\"Schulschwimmen\") is part of the elementary school curriculum leading to the entry level certificate (\"Frühschwimmer\") for about 90 percent of the children (a 95% goal set by the ministers for education with actual percentages ranging as low as 75% in some schools). About 50 percent reach a higher swimming level certificate during school swimming. In Switzerland most schools offer a swimming course, though only 70% of the students take part in it, which has led to the \"Schulschwimmen für alle\" petition in 2007. Unlike in Germany and Austria, the Swiss school swimming test commonly includes a jump from the diving tower.\nIn France, school swimming (\"natation scolaire\") is part of the curriculum for physical education in the second and third grade in elementary school, or for children aged between 4 and 6 years of age. The aim is successful completion of entry into water then swimming for , before floating for 10 seconds, then swimming on the front and on the back for each, ending with retrieval of an object from deep water of more than .\nIn England, the \"Top-ups scheme\" calls for those schoolchildren who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons. These children who have not reached the National Curriculum standard of swimming by the time they leave primary school will be given a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.\nIn Canada and Mexico there has been a call for swimming to be included in the public school curriculum, which has been implemented slowly in a few schools.\nIn Singapore, most swimming schools teach the SwimSafer Programme introduced by Singapore National Water Safety Council in July 2010 with support from the Singapore Sports Council. The SwimSafer Programme combines instruction in swimming and life-saving skills.\nSwimming levels.\nAustria.\nThe \"Arbeitsgemeinschaft Österreichisches Wasserrettungswesen\" (working committee for water rescue in Austria) is a joint committee of private organizations and government bodies. They have defined four grade levels of swimming lessons used in school swimming.\nAdditionally, the ÖWR water rescue organization's testing requirements for the \"Jugendschwimmerschein\" (youth swimmer certificate) includes 50 metres of breast stroke under 1 minute 5 seconds, 50 metres front crawl under 1 minute, 50 metres back crawl under 1 minute 19 seconds, description of lifeguard rules, 50 metres of rescue swimming with another similar-weight person, 100-metre snorkel under 1 minute 50 seconds, and 100 metres of swimming while clothed.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the Canadian Red Cross Swim program is used, with over one million Canadians enrolling each year. Similar to the system set out by the American Red Cross, the Swim Kids program for school-aged children consists of ten levels that progress from basic confidence-building skills to more complicated strokes and techniques. In beginner levels, students learn breathing techniques, basic water safety skills, and introductory swimming techniques including how to float and glide in the water at shallow depths. At intermediate levels, students are taught six swim strokes including front crawl, sculling, back crawl, breast stroke, elementary back stroke, and sidestroke. Advanced levels of the program teach students to use these techniques to swim in deeper water and remain safe while swimming. Upon successful completion of the ten levels of the program, students are eligible to enter the Bronze Medal programs (Bronze Star, Bronze Medallion, and Bronze Cross) to learn lifesaving skills. After completing all three Bronze Medal program courses, students can further advance with additional programs such as Water Safety Instructor (WSI) that teach them how to become swimming instructors themselves. Additional programs following the same structure at a faster pace are also available for teenagers and adults who wish to learn how to swim safely and build confidence in the water.\nAdditionally, 800,000 Canadians participate annually in Lifesaving Society (LSS) swimming, lifesaving, lifeguard, first aid, and leadership training programs. Each year LSS certifies thousands of instructors who provide the leadership for those training programs. As Canada's leading lifeguarding experts, LSS sets the standard for professional lifeguard training and certify Canada's National Lifeguards.\nGermany.\nThe \"Schwimmabzeichen\" (swimming badge) is assigned in four levels: Entry, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The levels are defined by the \"Bundesverband zur Förderung der Schwimmausbildung\" (federal association for promotion of swimming lessons—assembling NGO associations) in coordination with the federal \"Kultusministerkonferenz\" (assembly of the ministers for education of each \"Bundesland\"-state).\nThe entry level \"Frühschwimmer\" (early swimmer) includes a swimming test where the student shows a jump from side, a 25-metre swim (no style prescribed), and pickup of an object underwater. The \"Frühschwimmer\" level is better known by its mascot \"Seepferdchen\" (seahorse) shown on the badge, leading many to refer to it as the \"Seepferdchen\" certificate.\nThe bronze badge requires 200 metres of swimming in under 15 minutes (no style prescribed).\nThe silver badge requires 400 metres of swimming in under 12 minutes, pickup of an object from deep water (more than 2 metres), jump and dive from the side, and 10 metres of swimming underwater.\nThe gold badge requires 1,000 metres of swimming (under 24 minutes for males and under 29 minutes for females), sport swimming of 100 meters (under 1:50 for males and 2:00 for females), 100 metres of back crawl, 50 metres of rescue swimming, 15 metres of swimming underwater, pickup of three objects from deep water (2 metres minimum, under 3 minutes, maximum 3 attempts).\nLifeguard certificates are defined separately by each organization; the entry level is \"Junior-Retter\" (junior rescuer) at the DLRG (the largest aquatics life saving organization in the world) and \"Juniorwasserretter\" (junior water rescuer) at the \"Wasserwacht\" (water rescue branch of the German Red Cross). Extended Lifeguard certificate grades can be obtained at three levels of the \"Rettungsschwimmabzeichen\" (rescue swimming badge) in bronze, silver, and gold.\nNetherlands.\nThe Dutch National Swimming diploma is issued by the National council for swim safety. The national swimming diploma exist of the Swim-ABC and separate swimming skill diplomas. The National Council for swim safety advises children to get the full Swim-ABC program. This three-stage program will teach children the basic skills of swimming. When a child understands and masters the fundamentals of the basic swimming skills, they will earn a diploma. The Swim-ABC program consists of three separate diploma's. After getting all diploma's you officially meet the standards of the National norm of swim safety.\nSingapore.\nThe Singapore SwimSafer program works to help children learn how to swim and how to be safe in the water. This is a six-stage program that encourages kids to have fun and to learn at a pace that is right for them.\nThe programme was reviewed in 2016-2017 and refreshed version of SwimSafer was developed. SwimSafer 2.0 teaches people of all ages and varying abilities to swim and be safe in, or and around water. This programme emphasises skill development in conjunction with water safety and personal water survival education.\nSwitzerland.\nIn Switzerland the \"Schwimmtests\" (swimming tests) are not organized in levels; instead each ability is tested by itself and a number of test certificates are put in a group designation. The swimming tests are defined by \"swimsports.ch\", which is an association of swimming NGOs and the federal institute for sports (BASPO).\nThe Entry level has six tests: \"Ente\" (duck), \"Schwan\" (swan), \"Seehund\" (sea lion), \"Nilpferd\" (hippo), \"Schildkröte\" (turtle), and \"Biber\" (beaver).\nThe Basic level has seven tests: \"Krebs\" (crab), \"Seepferd\" (seahorse), \"Frosch\" (frog), \"Pinguin\" (penguin), \"Tintenfisch\" (cuttlefish), \"Krokodil\" (crocodile), and \"Eisbär\" (polar bear).\nThe Advanced level has eight tests: \"Wal\" (whale), \"Hecht\" (pike), \"Hai\" (shark), \"Delfin\" (dolphin), and four additional tests with no symbols assigned.\nUnited Kingdom.\nScotland\nIn Scotland swimming lessons are undertaken by pupils at an age 8 or 9 when the child is in Primary 5. These lessons take place during the school day. The Scottish Amateur Swimming Association – known as Scottish Swimming – has called for all young children to be entitled to free swimming lessons as they have been in England and Wales since the 1990s. Swimming lessons in Scotland have come under criticism because of the long waiting lists where in some counties there is a waiting list of up to 2000 children, or 1040 days. This has led to an increase of private swimming schools start up which are able to use private pools (as opposed to council run lessons only using council pools).\nLessons in Scotland generally follow two main award schemes, the STA (Swimming Teachers' Association) or Swim England (SE) award schemes. The council lessons tend to follow the SE Scheme whilst private swimming lessons use either of them. There have been a number of high-profile cases of private swimming lessons changing from SE to STA. Recognised by employers for their quality, Swim England consistently remain the preferred choice of over 80% of swimming teachers in England and Wales* [Ofqual statistics 2012-17] The STA also teaches about life-saving techniques in their lessons which the ASA offer as a separate course in conjunction with the Royal Life Saving Society. In England, all schools must provide swimming instruction either in key stage 1 or key stage 2. In particular, pupils should be taught to: swim competently, confidently and proficiently over a distance of at least 25 metres use a range of strokes effectively [for example, front crawl, backstroke and breaststroke] perform safe self-rescue in different water-based situations. There is no provision for this in the Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, most swimming schools use the swimming levels \"Learn To Swim\" as defined by the American Red Cross.\nLifeguard certificates are obtained directly in courses of the American Red Cross. The course length varies with 30 to 37 hours with an option for blended learning for the five certificates of Pool Lifeguarding, Waterfront Lifeguarding, Waterpark Lifeguarding, Aquatic Attractions Lifeguarding and Shallow Water Lifeguarding."

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1992 Summer Olympics took place on 28 July at the Piscines Bernat Picornell in Barcelona, Spain. There were 75 competitors from 52 nations. Nations had been limited to two swimmers each since the 1984 Games. The event was won by Alexander Popov of the Unified Team. Gustavo Borges's silver was Brazil's first medal in the men's 100 metre freestyle since 1960. Stéphan Caron of France repeated as bronze medalist, the eighth man to win multiple medals in the event. It was the first time since 1968 that the United States had competed and not won the event and the first time since 1956 that the Americans had competed and not taken any medal, as Jon Olsen finished fourth and defending champion Matt Biondi came in fifth.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nFive of the eight finalists from the 1988 Games returned: gold medalist Matt Biondi of the United States, bronze medalist Stéphan Caron of France, fourth-place finisher Gennadiy Prigoda of the Soviet Union (now competing for the Unified Team), sixth-place finisher Andrew Baildon of Australia, and eighth-place finisher Tommy Werner of Sweden.\nBiondi was the favorite, having also won the 1991 World Championship and his 1988 world record still standing. Caron and 1991 European Champion Alexander Popov were also contenders.\nAlbania, Lithuania, the Maldives, Saudi Arabia, and the Seychelles each made their debut in the event; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team and competitors from Yugoslavia competed as Independent Olympic Participants. The United States made its 20th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition used the A/B final format instituted in 1984. The competition consisted of two rounds: heats and finals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the A final, competing for medals through 8th place. The swimmers with the next 8 times in the semifinals competed in the B final for 9th through 16th place. Swim-offs were used as necessary to determine advancement.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition. Gustavo Borges set a new South American area record, and two national records were set: the Russian record by Alexander Popov and the Puerto Rican record by Ricardo Busquets.\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A (Q), while the next eight to final B (q).\nFinals.\nFinal A.\nPopov won, well ahead of everyone else. An equipment error resulted in the scoreboard initially displaying Caron as the second-place swimmer and Borges as last. Borges last was an obvious mistake to anyone watching; he had been fighting for second. His touchpad had malfunctioned. Officials reviewed film of \"his\" finish, assigning him a time of 49.53—equal to Biondi; they then realized that the film had been \"of Biondi\". Looking at the correct finish, the officials gave Borges a time of 49.43, good for the silver medal."

The event was won by Yevgeny Sadovyi of the Unified Team; it was the first victory in the men's 200 metre freestyle by an athlete from the former Soviet Union since Moscow 1980. Anders Holmertz of Sweden repeated as the silver medalist, becoming the first man to win multiple medals in the event. Antti Kasvio earned a bronze medal in Finland's debut in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nThree of the 8 finalists from the 1988 Games returned: silver medalist Anders Holmertz of Sweden, fourth-place finisher Artur Wojdat of Poland, and sixth-place finisher Steffen Zesner of East Germany (now competing for unified Germany). Reigning World Champion and world record holder Giorgio Lamberti of Italy competed in the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay but not this event after a bout of flu at the Italian trials kept him from qualifying. Reigning Olympic champion and Olympic record holder Duncan Armstrong of Australia also competed only in the relay. The other two medalists from the 1991 World Aquatics Championships were Zesner (silver) and Wojdat (bronze).\nBolivia, Finland, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Slovenia, and Sri Lanka each made their debut in the event; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. Australia made its ninth appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 8 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The 1984 event had also introduced a consolation or \"B\" final; the swimmers placing 9th through 16th in the heats competed in this \"B\" final for placing. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A (Q), while the next eight to final B (q).\nFinals.\nThere were two finals, one for the top 8 swimmers and one for the next 8 (9th through 16th)."

Students in Pre-Kindergarten through fourth grade attend Hynes Elementary School, and those in grades five through eight attend Golf Middle School. The school district has an enrollment of approximately 695 students (as of 2022) and is served by 90 teachers and staff.\nThe school district serves students in parts of Morton Grove, Niles, and Glenview (Reserve at Glenview apartment community). Geographically the district also includes a portion of Skokie that lack residents. Despite its name, the district does not include any part of Golf, Illinois, although it did prior to 1982.\nAs of the 2000 census, the district's total population was 6,738, with 2,446 households.\nThe district serves approximately 695 students.\nSchools.\nDistrict 67 has two schools:\nHynes Elementary School was built in 1957 and is named after former district teacher, principal and superintendent Irene E. Hynes.\nThe original Golf Elementary School was built in 1927 as a four-room school. It was expanded four times before being supplemented by Hynes Elementary School in 1957. Golf Junior High School was added in 1961. The Golf Middle School building remains at the site.\nDistrict 67 owns Frank Hren Discovery Park, which is adjacent to Golf Middle School. Frank P.

Terms of members are staggered so there are three or four positions filled at each school board election. Vacancies created by death or resignation are filled by appointment (by the remaining board members) until the following election. School board members complete statutorily required training and participate in other education related training.\nCommunity.\nThe school district is supported by an active parent-teacher association (School District 67 Parent Teacher Association),Golf PTA and by the Golf School District Foundation.Golf School District 67 Foundation\nA district Community Engagement Committee works to develop community partnerships, engage community members on topics relevant to district decisions and planning, and involve parents and other community members in activities and educational initiatives.\nDistrict 67 is a member of the Illinois Association of School Boards.Directory of Member Districts | IASB\nThe district is also a member of the Morton Grove Chamber of Commerce Directory Alpha Search: g | Morton Grove Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Niles Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry.Directory Alpha Search: G | Niles Chamber of Commerce and Industry\nRecognition.\nThe district achieved Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) every year since AYP's inception.\nDistrict schools received the Illinois Honor Roll Award for Academic\nExcellence in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\nGolf Middle School recently received a Blue Ribbon Award from the Illinois Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance.\nNational School Boards Association Salute District: Technology.\nThe district was awarded the Bright Red Apple Award in 2012 and 2013.\nIn 2014, the Illinois Association of School Boards awarded its 'School Board Governance Recognition' to the District 67 School Board. The award is designed to acknowledge school boards that have engaged in activities and modeled behaviors leading to excellence in local school governance in support of quality public education.\nHomefacts.com gave the district an overall 'A+' rating in 2014.\nHistory.\nThe Golf school district is named after the original Golf School, and the Village of Golf that the school originally served. The first Golf School was a prototypical \"one room country schoolhouse\" that was little more than a wooden shed with windows. It had no electricity or indoor plumbing. The single room was expanded to four, then replaced by a Works Progress Administration-built concrete and masonry structure capable of serving hundreds of students.\nDuring its time, the original Golf School was very much a rural institution, and presumably the only public-funded institute of primary/secondary education in its area at that time. The baby boom after World War II saw the landscape being converted from rural to suburban, and a sudden population growth. The Village of Golf was content to remain a hamlet, but the municipalities that surrounded it, Glenview, Morton Grove and Niles, expanded rapidly, consuming all unincorporated land. The prairie, forests and farmland that remained was rapidly developed for housing and shopping.\nHynes Elementary School joined the district in 1957, filling the distance between Golf School and Morton Grove School. In 1961, Golf Junior High School was built on the west side of the Golf School campus (the Golf School building was set back to the northeast corner of the parcel), and Golf School became Golf Elementary School. Shortly thereafter the Golf Junior High School building was expanded with modern, air-conditioned classrooms in the new wing. Golf Junior High School took students from Golf Elementary and Hynes Elementary schools, and sent graduates on to Niles North High School for secondary education.\nBy 1975 the baby boom population growth of students had turned into a population decline, and downsizing plans were enacted. The c. 1934 Golf Elementary School building was scheduled for demolition with no replacement. Hynes Elementary School became the only elementary school for the district, and Golf Junior High School (grades 6-8) became the 4-year Golf Middle School, accepting grades 5 through 8. The Village of Golf, after which the district was named, decided to send its children to public schools in Glenview.\nBefore the end of the 20th century the last working farm in District 67, Delaine Farm, had been converted into a housing development. In less than 70 years the demographics of District 67 have changed radically from rural and agrarian to suburban and professional."

        "title": "Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame",
        "text": "The Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame is a collection of plaques, mounted on a brick wall next to the Left Field Gate at Citizens Bank Park, the ballpark of the Philadelphia Phillies. From 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one figure from their franchise history and one notable person from the Philadelphia Athletics (A's) organization each year—with the exception of 1983, when the Phillies inducted their Centennial Team. Once Veterans Stadium closed in 2003, the wall plaques used to recognize the Phillies' members were moved to Citizens Bank Park; however, the Phillies no longer induct notable Athletics. Each person inducted into the Wall of Fame was honored with a metal plaque showing the person's face; their position with, and years of service to the team; and a summary of their most important contributions. In March 2004, the Athletics' plaques were relocated to the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, and a single plaque listing all of the A's inductees was attached to a statue of Connie Mack located across the street from Citizens Bank Park. After the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society closed its Hatboro location in 2013, the Athletics’ plaques were put on display at Spike’s Trophies in Philadelphia, among other memorabilia of the team..\nHistory.\nOriginally, the goal of the Wall of Fame was to induct the greatest players in Phillies and Athletics history; however, exceptions have been made for non-players who have made significant contributions to the organization. Mack, the Athletics' first inductee, had an 11-year playing career in the National League and the Players' League, but is most remembered for his managerial career, and was honored as such on the Wall. Members have been inducted for contributions in more than one area; Paul Owens, inducted in 1988, spent 48 years as a member of the Phillies organization, contributing as a scout, manager, general manager, and team executive. The Phillies have inducted four first basemen, four second basemen, five third basemen, three shortstops, one utility infielder, three catchers, 21 outfielders, 18 pitchers, seven managers, one general manager, one coach, two team executives, and two sportscasters. Twenty-one members of the Wall of Fame are also members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. All of the inductees in the first four seasons from both teams are members; Del Ennis was the first non-member to be inducted.\nThe first figures to be inducted into the Wall of Fame were Robin Roberts, who was inducted for the Phillies; and Mack, inducted for the A's. Roberts pitched in Philadelphia for 13 seasons as a member of the National League team, and Mack managed the American League club from 1901 to 1950. Although the Athletics have retired no numbers for players from their Philadelphia years, all seven players for whom the Phillies have retired a number or honored a \"P\" have been inducted into the Wall of Fame: Roberts (1978), Richie Ashburn (1979), Chuck Klein (1980), Grover Cleveland Alexander (1981), Jim Bunning (1984), Steve Carlton (1989), Mike Schmidt (1990), Dick Allen (1994) and Roy Halladay (2021).\nOn April 10, 2017, it was announced Pete Rose would be that year's inductee into the wall of fame. However, on August 12, 2017, just 10 days before the ceremony, the Phillies announced Rose would not be inducted amid statutory rape allegations. Instead of inducting someone new, they celebrated past inductees.\nFor the 2018 season Citizens Bank Park was renovated, resulting in the Phillies Wall of Fame being moved from Ashburn Alley. A new Wall of Fame area was created behind the Left Field scoreboard, next to the Left Field gate. This overhauled Left Field Plaza honors the team’s history and incorporates new concession offerings. Featuring large replicas of the team’s World Series trophies from 1980 and 2008, statues of its retired numbers along with the relocated Wall of Fame it is an area for fans to learn about and honor the team's past.\nInductees.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCentennial Team.\nIn 1983, rather than inducting a player into the Wall of Fame, the Phillies selected their Centennial Team, commemorating the best players of the first 100 years in franchise history. The Centennial Team includes players from several periods in Phillies history. The team is honored with a plaque listing the names of all players selected at the left end of the Wall of Fame. 11 members of the Centennial Team also have their own individual plaques on the Wall; those not otherwise included on the Wall are Jim Konstanty and Pete Rose."

        "title": "Rugby League Week",
        "text": "Rugby League Week (frequently abbreviated to RLW) was the highest selling Australian rugby league magazine, ahead of major competitor \"Big League\". It was published weekly (on Wednesdays) during the Australian rugby league season, which runs from March to late September (roughly corresponding to the southern hemisphere autumn and winter). The magazine was headquartered in Sydney.\nHistory.\nRugby League Week was launched in 1970. In 2001 the magazine's name was changed to \"League Week\", to avoid confusion with rugby union. It reverted to \"Rugby League Week\" in 2003. It was owned by Bauer Media Group. The former owner was ACP Magazines. The last edition was published on 27 March 2017.\nContent.\nThe magazine contained news coverage of Australian rugby league, focused primarily on the first-grade NRL competition (previously the NSWFL) but with coverage also devoted to lower-level competitions. There were usually also several profiles of rugby league players in each edition. A number of league personalities, including Mark Geyer, Stacey Jones and Wally Lewis, had regular columns; unconfirmed rumours and miscellaneous gossip are reported in a column written by 'The Mole'.\nEach edition contains previews of the games to be played in the next NRL round, running from Friday to Monday. Details of every match from the previous round are also included: the games are assessed and each player who took the field, as well as the referee, is given a rating. Details of when and by whom points were scored are also included. (Before the formation of the Brisbane Broncos, these ratings and details were also given for the Brisbane Rugby League competition.) Results, but not ratings, are published for most notable rugby league competitions in Australia, as well as major competitions in New Zealand and England.\nPlayer of the Year.\nRelated to the rating of players ever since \"Rugby League Week\" was first published during the 1970 NSWRFL season has been its Player of the Year award.\nSince 1978, players have been rated out of ten for every game. To deal with absences from club rugby due to interstate and Test duty, the five lowest scores of every player are deleted from their final score. After these five lowest scores are removed, the player with the highest score wins the award.\nFrom 1970 to 1977, the method of judging was the same except that players were awarded points out of five instead of ten.\nThe Immortals.\nIn 1981 \"Rugby League Week\" named 'The Immortals', four players that they considered to be the greatest in Australian history. In 1999 another two were added and in 2003 another one. At the end of the 2012 NRL season it was decided that Andrew Johns would become the eighth immortal. Currently numbering eight, The Immortals are:\nTen out of Ten.\nSince the 1978 NSWRFL season, Rugby League Week has rated each player in each premiership and representative game on a scale of 1-10. There have been 17 players since 1978 to achieve the rare feat of being rated 10/10 for a game. Manly-Warringah second row forward Terry Randall had the honour of being the first player to be rated 10/10 in the opening round of the 1978 season. Parramatta halfback Peter Sterling is the only player to achieve this twice while Brad Fittler is the only player to receive 10/10 in a representative game having done so in the second test of the 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand.\nRLW's 10/10 ratings since 1978 include:"

        "text": "A rowing club is a club for people interested in the sport of rowing. Rowing clubs are usually near a body of water, either natural or artificial, that is large enough for maneuvering the rowing boats. Clubs usually have a boathouse with racks to store boats, and a dock or slipway to get them into the water. Many clubs host rowing competitions, known as regattas or head races, and send teams to compete in other regattas and head races.\nThere are also indoor rowing clubs, where training and competition centers on rowing machines. There are indoor rowing regattas, such as CRASH-B Sprints which takes place every winter in Boston.\nThere are also rowing clubs without their own boathouses or equipment. For example, many high schools and universities maintain an alumni rowing club. Members of these clubs typically train on their own and meet up with their fellow club members to race. The club status must be maintained in order to participate in events sanctioned by USRowing, British Rowing, or other governing bodies."

        "text": "Ryan Terry Clark (born October 12, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a safety in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the LSU Tigers, and was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2002. Clark also played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and for the Washington Redskins. He won a Super Bowl ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, and made a Pro Bowl in 2011.\nClark has a sickle cell trait condition which made it dangerous for him to play at high altitudes, such as in Denver, Colorado.\nEarly years.\nClark was born in Marrero, Louisiana. In 1997 he graduated from Archbishop Shaw High School.\nCollege career.\nAt Louisiana State University, Clark started 36 consecutive games for the LSU Tigers football team. In 2000, he was selected to the All-SEC second team by the league's coaches. Clark ranked third on the Tigers in 2001 with 88 tackles, including 63 solo, and also intercepted three passes. He recorded five tackles, including a 13-yard sack, in the Sugar Bowl and was LSU's Special Teams Player of the Year in 1998.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\n2002.\nClark went undrafted in the 2002 NFL draft.\nOn April 26, 2002, the New York Giants signed Clark to a three-year, $906,000 contract as an undrafted free agent that included a signing bonus of $1,000.\nDuring training camp, Clark delivered a late hit to teammate and rookie wide receiver Tim Carter that sidelined the second round pick for six weeks. Head coach Jim Fassel named Clark a backup safety and a part of the special teams unit to begin his rookie season. Clark made his professional regular season debut during the New York Giants' 16–13 loss against the San Francisco 49ers. The following week, Clark made his first career tackle as the Giants defeated the St. Louis Rams 26–21. On October 21, 2002, the New York Giants released Clark and replaced him with veteran safety Johnnie Harris. On October 23, 2002, the New York Giants signed Clark to their practice squad where he would remain for the rest of his rookie season.\n2003.\nThroughout training camp in 2003, Clark competed for a roster spot against Shaun Williams and Ike Charlton. Head coach Jim Fassel named Clark the primary backup safety to begin the regular season, behind starters Shaun Williams and Omar Stoutmire. On October 19, 2003, Clark earned his first career start and deflected a single pass during a 14–10 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 7. In Week 12, he collected a season-high five solo tackles as the Giants lost 19–13 at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On December 28, 2003, Clark recorded three solo tackles and made his first career sack during a 37–24 loss against the Carolina Panthers in Week 17. Clark sacked Panthers' quarterback Jake Delhomme for a seven-yard loss in the third quarter. Clark finished the 2003 NFL season with 21 combined tackles (19 solo), two pass deflections, and one sack in 16 games and four starts.\nOn May 28, 2004, the New York Giants waived Clark after signing free agent safety Brent Alexander.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn July 31, 2004, the Washington Redskins signed Clark to a two-year, $835,000 contract as an unrestricted free agent. Head coach Joe Gibbs named Clark a backup safety behind Matt Bowen, Andre Lott, and rookie Sean Taylor. In Week 6, Clark became the starting free safety, alongside strong safety Sean Taylor, after season-ending injuries sidelined Matt Bowen and Andre Lott. On November 14, 2004, Clark collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (ten solo) during a 17–10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Clark finished the 2004 NFL season with 81 combined tackles (65 solo) and a pass deflection in 15 games and 11 starts.\n2005.\nThroughout training camp in 2005, Clark competed to be a backup safety against Pierson Prioleau. Clark began the season as the backup strong safety and was inactive for the first two games due to a sprained knee. In Week 4, Clark became the starting strong safety after Prioleau sustained a hamstring injury. Clark was inactive for the Redskins' Week 6 loss at the Kansas City Chiefs due to a chest injury. On October 30, 2005, Clark collected a season-high 11 solo tackles, deflected one pass, and made his first career interception during a 36–0 loss at the New York Giants in Week 8, intercepting a pass by Giants' quarterback Eli Manning that was intended for wide receiver Plaxico Burress. The following week, Clark recorded four combined tackles, a pass deflection, and intercepted a pass by Donovan McNabb during the fourth quarter of a 17–10 win against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 9. Clark finished the 2005 NFL season 57 combined tackles (42 solo), a career-high three interceptions, two pass deflections, two forced fumbles, and was credited with half a sack in 13 games and 13 starts.\nWhile he played well for Washington and wanted to re-sign with the team, the Redskins decided to cut ties with him and signed Adam Archuleta to be their new starting safety; the signing would be cited years later by NFL Network as one of the worst free agent signings in NFL history, along with other free agent busts by the Redskins including Deion Sanders and Albert Haynesworth.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\n2006.\nOn March 14, 2006, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Clark to a four-year, $7 million contract that included a signing bonus of $1.65 million. Clark was signed as a replacement for Chris Hope, who declined the Steelers' contract offer and opted to sign with the Tennessee Titans. Throughout training camp, Clark competed to be the starting free safety against Tyrone Carter. Head coach Bill Cowher named Clark the starting free safety to begin the regular season, alongside strong safety Troy Polamalu.\nOn October 8, 2006, Clark recorded nine combined tackles (six solo), one pass deflection, and made his first interception as a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers during a 23–12 loss at the San Diego Chargers in Week 5. He intercepted a pass by Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers during the first quarter. Clark was inactive for two games (Weeks 16–17) due to a groin injury.\nIn 2006, Clark made 72 tackles playing free safety for the Steelers, along with one interception and three fumble recoveries. He played 13 games and started 12 of them, missing the final three with a groin injury. During training camp before the 2007 season, he remained a starter despite a position battle with second year player Anthony Smith.\n2007.\nDuring a 2007 game against the Denver Broncos at Invesco Field at Mile High, Clark developed severe pain in his left side and had to be rushed to the hospital. It turned out that Clark had had a splenic infarction due to the sickle cell trait which he has had since he was a child; these are usually a risk at high altitudes. Clark had to have his spleen and gall bladder removed, ending his season. He lost 30 pounds after the removal, but returned to the Steelers in 2008. Although Clark was medically cleared to play in Denver's thin air without any complications, the Steelers took the precautionary measure of deactivating him for the four games played in Denver thereafter during Clark's career with the team—a 2009 Monday Night game, a 2010 preseason game, a 2011 playoff game and the 2012 season opener.\n2008–2010.\nClark was the Steelers' recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award in 2008. After the 2008 season, Clark started in Super Bowl XLIII where the Steelers won against the Arizona Cardinals, recording five total tackles. After the 2010 season, he started in the Steelers' appearance in Super Bowl XLV against the Green Bay Packers, where he recorded eight total tackles in the 31–25 loss.\n2011–2014.\nSet to become a free agent in the 2014 offseason, the Steelers made no attempt to resign Clark. The Steelers proceeded with their plans to replace him after they signed Mike Mitchell to a long-term contract on March 11, 2014, to become the team's new starting free safety.\nWashington Redskins (second stint).\nOn March 31, 2014, Clark returned to Washington on a one-year contract. With DeAngelo Hall on injured reserve, he was named the team's defensive captain in his place. He recorded his only interception of the season against quarterback Andrew Luck in a loss against the Indianapolis Colts on November 30.\nRetirement.\nOn February 18, 2015, Clark announced his retirement from the NFL. He signed a one-day contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers to ensure he retired a Steeler.\nPost-playing career.\nBroadcasting career.\nIn March 2015, Clark was signed by ESPN as an NFL analyst to appear on \"NFL Live\", \"SportsCenter\", 'Get Up!' and \"First Take.\"\nIn July 2021, Clark and former UFC heavyweight and light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier began hosting the weekly MMA podcast \"DC &amp; RC\" on ESPN.\nIn 2023, Clark was named winner of the “Outstanding Personality/Studio Analyst” category at the 44th annual Sports Emmy Awards.\nHe is currently the host of a weekly highlight show Inside the NFL, a role he has held since the show first moved to The CW in 2023.\nPodcasting.\nIn 2022, Ryan partnered with Shots Podcast Network to create The Pivot Podcast with his friends and retired NFL players Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder.\nPersonal life.\nClark is married to Yonka Clark. The couple have three children together: Jaden, Jordan, and Loghan. Jordan plays football at Notre Dame.\nClark was active in the community and, while with the Giants, he participated in the 2002 United Way Hometown Huddle by conducting a football clinic at the Highbridge Center for members of Alianza Dominicana, a local United Way agency that services families in Washington Heights. He joined forces with students from the Leadership In Public Services High School located at Ground Zero for \"Operation PaintFest.\" Sponsored by the Foundation for Hospital Art, the participants created paintings of hope that would later be donated to the five New York City hospitals involved in the September 11 attacks tragedies.\nClark is involved with sickle cell disease awareness, research, treatment and programming in Pittsburgh. In 2012, he announced the formation of Ryan Clark's Cure League to raise awareness about sickle cell trait and eventually find a cure."

These are generally not supervised by adults. Participants wear helmets and sometimes gloves and fight in a locker room. The object of the game is to score as many hits on the head as possible until the opponent is knocked down, gives up, or their helmet falls off.\nThe game is often seen as rite of passage for players and fighters feel peer pressure to participate. There is false sense of security among teens that face and head are protected.\nAn editorial in the May/June 2006 \"Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine\" brought attention to the game and its risk of concussion.

        "text": "James Lee Donaldson III (born August 16, 1957) is a British-American former professional basketball player who grew up in California and played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association and several leagues across Europe. Born in Heacham, England, Donaldson played high school basketball for Luther Burbank High School in California before enrolling at Washington State University to play for the Cougars.\nEarly life.\nDonaldson was born as a military brat in Heacham, England, to a father who was stationed in the Air Force.\nAmateur career.\nDonaldson, a 7'2\" center, starred at Luther Burbank High School and Washington State in the late 1970s. In his 4 seasons at WSU he averaged 8.5 points per game and 8.1 rebounds per game in 84 games. As of April 2015 he was the all-time leader in career blocked shots (176), blocks average (2.1), single-season blocks (82 in 1977–78), single-season blocks average (3.0 in 1977–78) and single-game blocked shots (eight versus Stanford, January 25, 1978). He was inducted into the Pac-12 Hall of Honor and WSU's athletic hall of fame in 2006.\nProfessional career.\nAfter being drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1979 NBA draft he signed a contract with 3A Antonini Siena of the Italian Serie A.\nDonaldson played three seasons with Seattle before moving on to the San Diego (later Los Angeles) Clippers. During the 1984–85 NBA season, he led the league in field goal percentage at 0.637—still one of the ten highest percentages in NBA history.\nDonaldson cited Artis Gilmore, Darryl Dawkins, Moses Malone, Truck Robinson and Maurice Lucas as some of the strongest players he played against early in his career.\nDonaldson joined the Dallas Mavericks in 1985. He joked with teammates that leaving the lowly, dysfunctional Clippers for the Mavericks was like dying and going to heaven. He had his finest years while playing for the Mavericks, providing rebounding and shot-blocking to complement Dallas' star-studded line-up, which included Mark Aguirre, Rolando Blackman, Roy Tarpley, Derek Harper, Sam Perkins, and Brad Davis. Donaldson himself earned a spot on the 1988 All-Star Team during a season in which the Mavericks reached the Western Conference Finals before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. The NY Daily News named him the worst All-Star player ever after a fans voting. Sadly, things fell apart for the Mavericks generally in the late 1980s and early 1990s as their core group was either traded away (like Aguirre) or squandered vast potential via personal problems (like Tarpley) and Donaldson became the target for many fans and even his teammates for the franchise's woes, making the end of his otherwise hugely successful tenure in Dallas inevitable.\nIn 1990 he was founder and CEO of a dating magazine named Eligibles. It was published for a brief period of time in Dallas-Ft. Worth before going out of business. \nAfter brief stints with the New York Knicks (traded midway through 1991–92 for Brian Quinnett) and Utah Jazz (49 games in two seasons combined) in the early 1990s, injuries forced Donaldson into retirement from the NBA. He left the league in 1995, with 8,203 career points, 7,492 career rebounds and 1,267 career blocks. He played in 957 NBA games without ever attempting a 3-point shot, a record among players from the 3-point era.\nOn August 1, 1993 he signed for Greek Basket League club Iraklis. He played in 30 games for Iraklis averaging 12.1 points per game, 12.2 rebounds per game and 2.2 blocks per game. In the 1996–97 season he played for Caja San Fernando averaging 3.5 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. He also had spells with Snai Montecatini (Italy, 1997–98, for only six games), Breogán Lugo (Spain, two stints, in 1998 and 1999) and Gymnastikos S. Larissas (Greek Second Division, 1998–99), retiring for good at the age of 41.\nPersonal life.\nUpon retiring, Donaldson settled in the Seattle area, where he ran the Donaldson Clinic, a physical therapy business in Mill Creek, Washington, until February 2018. He is also a motivational speaker.\nIn 2009, Donaldson ran for the non-partisan office of Seattle mayor and came in fourth among the candidates. In 2010, Donaldson joined the College Success Foundation as the Director of the Tacoma College Success Foundation.\nIn January 2018, Donaldson survived an aortic dissection."

He was a former radio personality for the San Jose Sharks and was their television color commentator from 2014 to 2020.\nPlaying career.\nBaker was selected by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1988 NHL Supplemental Draft. Following an outstanding college career with the St. Lawrence University Skating Saints, Baker went on to play in ten NHL seasons. In 404 career games, he tallied 71 goals and 150 points. Baker also appeared in 25 Stanley Cup playoff games. As a player, Baker is best known for scoring the series-winning goal for the San Jose Sharks in the seventh game of the 1994 Western Conference Quarterfinals against the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings. Baker is tied with Jeff Friesen for the Sharks single-season short-handed goals record with six, set in his 1995-96 season during which he scored 16 total goals.\nIn 2005–06 season, Baker returned to the San Jose Sharks, joining Dan Rusanowsky and David Maley on the Sharks' radio broadcast team. He called most games with Rusanowsky, although he would occasionally be replaced by Maley when sent on assignments for the organization. On occasions, Baker and Maley joined Rusanowsky in a popular \"triple-cast\" format. Beginning with the 2008–09 season, Baker formally hosted pre-game and post-game shows for Sharks games on NBC Sports Bay Area. He became Randy Hahn's color commentator on the Sharks' NBC Sports California broadcasts in 2014 after Drew Remenda's departure to a same role for the Edmonton Oilers, but this time, he called all Sharks home games from \"Inside-the-Glass.\" From the 2018–19 season until 2020, he and Bret Hedican joined Randy Hahn in a popular \"triple-cast\" format.\nBaker was also a co-coach of the Santa Clara Blackhawks CAHA state championship winning Bantam A team for the 2009–10 season."

        "text": "The EHF Champions League is the most important club handball competition for men's teams in Europe and involves the leading teams from the top European nations. The competition is organised every year by EHF. The official name for the men's competition is the EHF Champions League Men.\nThe EHF coefficient rank decides which teams have access and in which stage they enter.\nEligibility and qualifying.\nEach year, the EHF publishes a ranking list of its member federations. The first 9 nations are automatically permitted to participate in the tournament with their national champion. The national federation ranked first place in the EHF European League, currently Germany, is awarded a second qualification berth for the domestic runner-up. The remaining six positions are designated through wildcards, with each national federation without two teams already qualified able to submit a single applicant. The wildcards are judged on five criteria: venue, TV, spectators, results in past EHF competitions and product management and digital.\nTournament format.\nEach year, the EHF publishes a ranking list of its member federations. The first nine nations are allowed to participate in the tournament with their national champion. In addition, the tenth spot is reserved for the best ranked national federation of the EHF European League Men. The national federations are allowed to request upgrades for their teams eligible to play in the EHF European League and based on the criteria list the EHF Executive Committee approves six upgrades.\nThe EHF Champions League is divided into four stages. All participating teams enter the competition in the group phase.\nThe current playing system has been introduced before the 2020/21 season.\nGroup phase.\nSince the 2020/21 season, the format sees two groups formed, with eight teams each in Group A and B. All the teams in each group play each other twice, in home and away matches (14 rounds in total). The first two teams in Groups A and B advance directly to the quarter-finals, while teams from positions three to six in each of these groups proceed to the playoff. The season is over for the last two teams in each group after the completion of the group phase.\nPlay off.\nThe pairings for the playoff are decided by the placement of the teams at the end of the group phase (A6 vs B3, B6 vs A3, A5 vs B4 and B5 vs A4). Each pairing is decided via a home and away format, with the aggregate winners over the two legs advancing to the quarter-finals. The higher ranked teams in the group phase have the home right advantage in the second leg.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe pairings for the quarter-finals are also decided by the placement in the group phase (Winner of A5/B4 vs A1, Winner B5/A4 vs B1, Winner A6/B3 vs A2, Winner B6/A3 vs B2). The ties are decided through a home and away format, with the four winners over the two legs played in each pairing advancing to the EHF FINAL4. The higher ranked teams in the group phase have the home right advantage in the second leg.\nEHF FINAL4.\nThe official name for the men's EHF FINAL4 is the EHF FINAL4 Men. The participating EHF FINAL4 teams are paired for the semifinals through a draw and play the last two matches of the season over a single weekend at one venue. The two semi-finals are played on a Saturday, with the third-place game and final on a Sunday.\nBrand Sound.\nMuch like the visual brand identity, the brand sound identity will acoustically connect the various leagues and tournaments which fit under the EHF umbrella. For the EHF Brand Sound, the authors got to the core of \"The Sound of Handball\" and created a handball sound DNA as the recurring element across all audio-visual applications. The jump shot was identified as the most iconic and defining handball movement.\nThrough video analysis and motion tracking, the jump shot was extracted into a rhythmic design pattern. There are numerous application opportunities of the brand sound, which will be developed over time. First implementations of the new EHF Brand Sound will be heard in the EHF Champions League. The premium character of this tournament was translated into a modern sound design through a new EHF Champions League sound logo and anthem. Both will come to life in the arena and will consistently complement all audio-visual communications.\nThe previous anthem for the EHF Champions League is \"Hymn of the Champions\", used until the end of the 2019/20 season and exclusively written by Austrian film composer Roman Kariolou in 2007. The recording played during the entry ceremony before every game was performed by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra, conducted by David Hernando.\nWinners.\nEHF Champions League.\nNotes: \nRecords and statistics.\nGoals scored in the Final Four by nations.\nAll the goals scored in the Final Four by the nationality of the players. \nCoaches with most titles.\n\"* Horst Dreischang won titles with Gummersbach in 1967 and 1970.

He was part of the Western Province team that won the Currie Cup in 1997, contributing immensely with his accurate goal kicking. It was this dependable boot that led to his recall to the Springbok team in 2003 after a two-year absence, but following a difficult tournament and South Africa's disappointing exit in the quarter-finals, Koen was signed by Narbonne in France. After two years dogged by injury, Koen moved back to Western Province as only the second full-time kicking coach in South Africa.

It was founded as a continental governing body on February 13, 1976 in the headquarters of the Mexican Olympic Committee in Mexico City. The Pan American Badminton Confederation was founded by Badminton Canada, the Jamaica Badminton Association, Federacion Mexicana de Badminton, Comision Nacional de Badminton Peru and the United States Badminton Association. \nBPAC was founded in Mexico City in 1976 and had nominated Victor Jaramillo of Mexico as President until an official election was scheduled to take place at the first Pan Am Championships the following year. The first Badminton Pan Am Championships was held in Moncton, New Brunswick-Canada, in April 1977.\nJaramillo was confirmed as president and stayed in position until 1981. During these five years, the Pan American Badminton Championships were held in Canada, Peru, Mexico, and USA. As far as Pan Am Junior Championships, they were held in Mexico, Canada, USA and Peru. From 1981 to 1987, there was no contest until November 1987 when the V Pan Am Badminton Championships was held in Lima, Peru.\nOutstanding efforts were made by Helen Baxter of Canada trying to reactivate the Pan American Badminton Confederation since 1982 and also with the help on the part of the Badminton Peru National Commission President, Mr. José Andrés Bellido, Badminton Pan Am, once again, became an active member of the then International Badminton Federation in 1987.

There are now currently 37 member associations, of which 3 countries are associate members (French Guiana, Guadeloupe &amp; Martinique). Its headquarters are now located in Lima, Peru.\nFollowing a general meeting held in Campinas, Brazil back in November, 2006, the confederation decided to change the name from Pan American Badminton Confederation to Badminton Pan Am.\nMember associations.\nBadminton Pan Am has 37 member associations:"

        "title": "Clemson Rugby",
        "text": "The Clemson University Rugby Football Club (often abbreviated as Clemson Rugby) was founded in 1967. Clemson finished the 2005 Season ranked #14, the 2006 Season ranked #13 in the nation, and the 2007 season #17. Clemson's best season was in 1996 when the team advanced to the quarterfinals of the national playoffs and finished ranked 7th nationally. Rugby is one of the oldest club sports at Clemson University. The team has gone 57–15 in the last three years, with the only losses coming to men's teams and top 20 ranked college rugby teams. There was also an article about Clemson Rugby in the Greenville News in the Spring of 2006.\nTroy Hall has served as the head coach of Clemson Rugby since 2020.\nChampionships.\nNational Playoffs:\nHistory.\nIn spring 1967 four friends, Frank N. Mora III (Puerto Rico), Jeremy Pike (Australia), Nick Schoular (United Kingdom), and Geoff Tyers (United Kingdom) led the effort to bring the sport of rugby to Clemson University. During the first few years the team struggled through many years of hardships like most new teams working to increase membership, secure matches and develop coaching skills. As time passed, however, the team improved. In 1971, Clemson Rugby secured a significant upset victory over Yale — the 1970 Ivy League champions who were on a 19-game winning streak. Clemson Rugby soon became a major force in collegiate rugby.\nDuring the first half of the 1970s the club was one of only a handful in the South. As a result, it led to the team consistently competing against University of North Carolina, Charleston Rugby Club, N.C. State, Atlanta Old White and Medical College of Georgia. In 1973 Clemson rugby alumni Jim McMillan helped found the rugby team at the Medical College of Georgia. In 1972 the club took its first international tour to the Bahamas. The club lost a very tight match to the Freeport Rugby Club due to a very questionable call by the referee in the last minute of the match. The Freeport rugby club at that time had never lost to a U.S. team.\nIn November 1980 the team hosted the ACC rugby tournament in Clemson. After a series of challenging matches the team ended up facing the University of Virginia in the finals. The match was played in very cold and yet conditions; however, Clemson emerged victorious. During the mid-1980s the club continued to play full spring and fall schedules, adding to the list of rival clubs Belmont Abbey, Wake Forest, Olde Grey, Johnson City and the Citadel. A tour to Florida was made in spring 1985.\nIn 1989, Clemson rugby finished 12th in the country with an undefeated record.\nThe 1990s were a time for change within Clemson rugby. Former Clemson player Frank Graziano (class of 1977) became the program's first ever head coach in 1991. Graziano instilled an idea of field dominance nationally. During Coach Graziano's time with the team, Clemson rugby achieved several major accomplishments: Clemson's first undefeated season, Georgia Rugby Union champions, a number one ranking in the Southeast, and entrance into the quarterfinals of the national playoffs where the Tigers matched up against Penn State after a first-round victory over Cornell University.\nIn Clemson rugby's 30th year and in the same school year of Coach Graziano's departure for a USA Rugby Collegiate Director position, the Tigers remained strong. The Tigers performed well against university teams throughout the south. A difficult fall led to a successful spring semester in which Clemson Rugby would again be in the national spotlight. After defeating every southern team they faced, the Tigers headed to the Round of 16 of the national playoffs.\nClemson's best season was 1996, when the team advanced to the national college rugby quarterfinals. Clemson also advanced to the round of 16 of the national playoffs for three consecutive years from 2005 to 2007. Clemson has played since 2011 in the Atlantic Coast Rugby League against its traditional ACC rivals. Clemson placed second in its conference in the spring 2012 season with a 6-1 conference record, missing out to Maryland for the conference title and a place in the national college rugby playoffs. Clemson finished the spring 2013 season with a 6-1 conference record, and then defeated South Carolina 29–7 in the round of 16 national playoffs, before losing in the quarterfinals to Central Florida 20–24.\nClemson currently competes as a Division IAA team in the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference, which is affiliated with National Collegiate Rugby.\nTeam record.\n2005-2006: 14-4 Clemson outscored their opponents 766–313. 0–2 in National Tournament, 35–46 against Navy and 22–32 against UC Santa Barbara. \n2004-2005: 17-8-1 Second in the South. 0–2 in National Tournament, 18–35 against Army and 26–46 to Penn State. \n2003-2004: 20-2 \nSpring 2001: 3-3 \nSpring 1998: 7-0 Defeated Citadel 100-0 and Emory 94-0 \nFall 1997: 3-3 \nSpring 1997: 5-3 \nFall 1996: 5-5 \nFall 1995: 6-1-1 \nSpring 1995: 10-0 Defeated USC 85-0\nRecords.\nClemson went 14–0 in the fall 2003 for the best winning percentage ever for the Fall Season. Clemson won 19 games In the fall of 2004 for the most ever in the Fall Season.\nClemson set the team scoring record in 2006 with a 118–3 victory over the University of Florida. Clemson's previous record was in 1998 when they defeated Citadel 100–0.\nFoundation and Alumni.\nClemson Rugby has grown off the field as well. The Tigers have made several large strides in improving Clemson Rugby's organization. The team has set up an alumni fund to allow graduates to give back to the club. The annual alumni gathering at homecoming is a highly anticipated event where former players and supporters are hosted at several events including a dinner, inter-collegiate rugby match, an alumni match against the college team, and a post match cookout which allows the past players to socialize with the present players and tell old war stories. \nThe Clemson Rugby Foundation helps increase the support of the Clemson Rugby teams. The Clemson Rugby Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and was founded during Clemson Rugby's 40th year. The Foundation has allowed the alumni and supporters a more organized way of supporting rugby at Clemson, including the creation of several scholarships, coaching stipends, and other grants.\nPlayers.\nClemson has had numerous South All-Stars, U-19 All-stars and GRU All-stars during the team's history:\nClemson Alumni have gone on to play in the top league in the country: Rugby Super League in the last few years: \nCoaches:\nAll-South Selections.\n2008 South All-Stars\n\"Mike Fitzgerald\", \"Ben \"Broadway\" Walence\" \n2007 South All-Stars\n\"Mike \"Irish\" Ireson\", \"Mike Fitzgerald\", \"Geoff Clott\", \"Ben \"Broadway\" Walence\" \n2006 South All-Stars\n\"Jason Hinchman\", \"Dutch Jones\", \"Mike Fitzgerald\", \"Robert Bortins\", \"Matt \"Wayne\" Bassett\" \n2005 South All-Stars\n\"Jason Hinchman\", \"Dutch Jones\", \"Mike \"Irish\" Ireson\", \"Bryan Burton\" \n2004 South All-Stars\n\"Jason Hinchman\", \"Dutch Jones\", \"Shawn Hanna\", \"Scott Waggeman\", \"Ryan Wolf\" \n2003 South All-Stars\n\"None\" \n2002 South All-Stars\n\"None\" \n2001 South All-Stars\n\"Will Phillips\" and \"Neil Yanik\"\n2000 South All-Stars\n\"Will Phillips\", \"Johnathon Mullikin\", and \"Neil Yanik\" \n1999 South All-Stars\n\"Unknown\" \n1998 South All-Stars\n\"Andras Bende\", \"Jim Gaine\", \"Will Phillips\"\n1997 South All-Stars\n\"Andras Bende\", \"Jim Gaine\", \"David Merchant\", \"Will Phillips\"\nPrevious seasons.\nFall season summary 2004.\nDec 03, 2004 First XV results: \nRecord: 8-1-1 \nPoints For: 378 \nPoints against: 115 \nAvg.

Outscoring their opponents 819–245 in 22 games, the Tigers averaged a 26-point margin of victory. While recording five shutouts, their largest victories came over Georgia 85–0 and Florida 72–5. The team won two tournaments and had nine games where the Tigers kept their opponents under ten points. The two losses came in the playoffs to the University of North Carolina and the University of Tennessee, and CURFC would have to wait another year to make it to the Sweet 16. Clemson Rugby also traveled to Louisiana on their first fall break tour since 1995 and returned undefeated against LSU and Tulane.\nClemson has been successful due in part to their recruiting efforts and attitude towards the sport. \"We have gone away from the idea that the students will come out if they are interested.\" Coach Jim Gaine stated. \"We do our best to market the sport as an avenue for the students to continue competition and be a part of the Clemson experience, not just another thing to do after class.\" The Tigers have five players representing the south collegiate all-stars in Boulder, Colorado, this June at the National All-Star Championship."

        "text": "The 91st Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 27, 2007. It was the twelfth Indianapolis 500 sanctioned by the Indy Racing League and the fifth race of the 2007 IndyCar Series season. Hélio Castroneves started the race on the pole position.\nThe race began at 1:11 p.m. EDT, and was televised in the United States on the ABC. The race was broadcast in high-definition for the first time. The race also was carried live on the IMS Radio Network and XM Satellite Radio.\nOn lap 113, the race underwent a lengthy rain delay, with Tony Kanaan tentatively sitting as the leader. After three hours, the rain ceased, the track was dried, and the race restarted shortly before 6:15 p.m. EDT. A crash on lap 162 between Dan Wheldon and Marco Andretti brought out the yellow flag with Dario Franchitti leading. Under the caution, rain began falling again and officials halted the race on lap 166. Dario Franchitti was declared the winner after leading 34 laps during the race.\nAll entries utilized ethanol, after 42 years of utilizing methanol. As part of a two-year roll-out, the cars used a 10% ethanol blend in 2006, and for 2007, the cars utilized a full ethanol mixture. Although branded as \"100% percent fuel-grade\", the fuel was actually a denatured 98% ethanol/2% gasoline blend (E98). The 2007 race was also the final 500 to see the Panoz chassis in competition.\nQualifying (second weekend).\nSaturday May 19, 2007 - Third Day Qualifying.\n†Qualification withdrawn on bump day.\n††Bumped on bump day.\nCarb Day.\nFriday May 25, 2007 - Checkers/Rally's Pit Stop Challenge.\nTeam Penske won the 31st annual pit stop contest, their record tenth overall victory in the event. The teams of Hélio Castroneves and Sam Hornish Jr. (both Penske entries) met in the finals with Castroneves and his chief mechanic Rick Rinaman winning the $100,000 first prize after an 8.335-second pit stop.\nStarting grid.\n' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner; ' = Indianapolis 500 rookie \nFailed to Qualify\nRace summary.\nPre-race.\nRain fell overnight, but stopped before the gates opened in the morning. At 7:45 a.m., rain began to fall again, and threatened to delay or wash out the race. Around 10:00 a.m., the rain stopped and maintenance crews began to dry the track. Despite the morning showers, Speedway chairperson Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines on time as scheduled at 1:05 p.m. EDT.\nStart.\nDuring the pace lap, the race nearly took a dramatic turn as pole-sitter Hélio Castroneves failed to start. After several attempts, his car finally fired, and he joined the field in turn 4. A rather ragged start saw Castroneves take the lead into the first turn, but Tony Kanaan slipped by to lead lap one. Green-flag racing continued until lap 11, when John Andretti lost a rear-view mirror, bringing out a debris caution yellow flag.\nWhen racing resumed, Castroneves, Tony Kanaan, Marco Andretti, and Scott Dixon all took their turn at the lead. Roberto Moreno caused the 2nd caution when he slid high in turn 1, slapped the wall, and hit the wall again in turn 2 before coming to rest. Jon Herb was the next car to be in an accident after he slid in turn 2 and hit the wall, ending his day. Milka Duno also spun in turn 1 and backed her car into the wall, damaging and ending her day as well.\nOn the 74th lap, Dario Franchitti took the lead for the first time, and led until he pit on the 89th lap. Around that time, officials were warning that rain was approaching the area. After several drivers sequenced through green-flag pit stops, Tony Kanaan led Marco Andretti. Suddenly, on the 99th lap, John Andretti got high in turn two, and crashed into the outside wall, bringing out the caution. Jeff Simmons found himself unexpectedly in the lead, but pitted a lap later, giving Marco Andretti the lead. With rain only a few miles away, the ensuing lap 107 restart could decide the winner. As the green came out, Tony Kanaan got the jump on Andretti, and took the lead in turn 1. Moments later, Phil Giebler spun and crashed in turn 1, bringing the yellow out once again. Before safety crews could clear the track, heavy rain fell, and the race was red flagged.\nRed flag.\nWhen the race was stopped, 113 laps were completed. A race is required to go a minimum of 101 laps before it can be official. If rain continued the rest of the afternoon, it could be declared official. Andretti Green Racing was scored 1st-2nd-3rd with Kanaan leading, Marco Andretti second, and Danica Patrick third. After nearly three hours, the rain stopped and the track was dry. Shortly after 6:00 p.m., the field lined up in the pits for a restart.\nRestart.\nTony Kanaan took over where he left off and pulled away from the field. Danica Patrick got by Marco Andretti and took over second place. Approximately 30 laps of uninterrupted intense green flag racing followed. Another sequence of green-flag pit stops saw all of the leaders head to the pits. Jaques Lazier stayed out a couple of extra laps, and led the race for the first time in his career. After the stops, Kanaan returned to the lead, followed by defending champion Sam Hornish Jr.\nFinish.\nOn the 151st lap, Marty Roth slid high in turn 1 and smacked the wall, and started an exciting sequence of events. The skies were darkening, and rain was fast approaching again, which would certainly end the race for good. Under the yellow, many leaders pit for tires and fuel, while some drivers, including Dario Franchitti and Scott Dixon, stayed out to gain track position. On the 156th lap, the field went back to green, however, in turn four, Tony Kanaan came up on the back of Jaques Lazier, sending Lazier into the wall, and sending Kanaan's car into a spin. He blew a tire and coasted into the pits. Moments later, the field assembled for what was expected to be the final restart before the rains came. Franchitti, working lap 163, held the lead into the backstretch. Behind him, Marco Andretti tangled with Dan Wheldon, and Andretti's car flipped down the backstretch. Buddy Rice was also involved. Before the track could be cleared, a heavy rainstorm fell on the track, and the race was called after 166 laps with Dario Franchitti declared the winner. A makeshift victory lane celebration was held indoors underneath the Pagoda, as had been done for Rice who also won in the rain in 2004.\nAs of the 2022 race, this was the most recent \"500\" to be shortened by rain.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nRace statistics.\nNine drivers led the race, with a total of twenty-three lead changes.\nAwards.\nThe Victory Celebration was held Monday May 28, 2007. Some of the many awards handed out during the evening included:\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was broadcast in the United States on ABC for the 43rd consecutive year. Time trials were shown live on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2. For the first time, the race would be aired in high definition.\nThis was the final 500 broadcast for Rusty Wallace as he was involved with ESPN on ABC NASCAR broadcasts.\nFor the second year in a row, the telecast utilized the Side-by-Side format for commercial breaks.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the IMS Radio Network for the 55th consecutive year. Mike King served as anchor. Davey Hamilton, who previously served as the \"driver expert\" on the network, returned to cockpit for the first time since 2001. After six years recovery from his serious crash, he offered live in-car reporting to the broadcast during caution periods.\nMaking a popular return to the IMS Radio Network was former \"Voice of the 500\" Bob Jenkins. In 2006, Jenkins had worked on the Speedway public address system, but for 2007, he took over the turn two reporting location. Jenkins filled the spot previously held by Adam Alexander, who departed the network.\nFor the third year in a row, Kevin Olson conducted his annual pre-race interview with David Letterman. Olson served as a pit reporter in the center pits during the early stages of the race, then later moved to cover the garages and track hospital."

League play featured continental tournaments for men and women, from which the top teams emerged to play in the championship tournament (the \"Super Final\") where the league champion team is crowned.\nMen's league play began in 2002, to capitalize on increased worldwide popularity of water polo created by the 2000 Olympic Games, especially in Europe, North America and Australia. The women’s league was added in 2004, based on growing interest in women's play.\nIn October 2022, FINA announced that the tournament would be replaced with the FINA Water Polo World Cup and FINA Women's Water Polo World Cup from 2023 on.\nPlay format.\nMatches consisted of four eight-minute quarters, with a five-minute half-time break. Tie games were decided by an immediate penalty shootout. The game venues had television requirements to bring the sport to the biggest audience possible. Rule changes were made to provide more spectacular play and yield higher scores.\nPreliminary rounds of play were organized by continent: Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. The structure of continental play varied within the league.

        "text": "David Morris (born 27 November 1988 in Kilkenny) is an Irish former professional snooker player. In the 2015-2016 he was ranked as Ireland's number 3 player, after Fergal O'Brien and Ken Doherty.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAged 16, he reached the quarter finals of the U21 World Snooker Championships. He has been Irish champion at every level, winning the overall National championship every year from 2004 to 2006 (becoming the youngest ever winner in 2004). For 2006–07 he made his debut on the main tour, reaching the last 64 in two tournaments.\nHis best run in the 2007–2008 season was to the last 48 of the UK Championships, where he lost to Dave Harold (who also defeated him in qualifying for the previous year's Welsh Open). His only opening-round defeat that year was to Supoj Saenla in the World Championship, but despite this setback in the highest ranking-point event of the season he did enough to reach the top 64 of the rankings. He also won the Lucan Racing Irish Classic, an event staged by Fergal O'Brien featuring 8 (mostly Irish) professionals – Morris beat O'Brien 5–3 in the final.\nIn qualifying for the 2008/2009 Bahrain Championship Morris defeated countryman Rodney Goggins and Adrian Gunnell to reach the final qualifying round, where he lost 0–5 to Michael Holt, scoring just 10 points in the process (the lowest in a match of five or more frames since 1992)\n2010/2011.\nHe made an important breakthrough at the World Open by beating Robert Milkins 3–1 and Ben Woollaston 3–0 to qualify for the televised stages of an event for the first time. However, he was drawn against the current world champion Neil Robertson losing 3–1.\n2011/2012.\nMorris left his best run of results in the ranking events until the last tournament of the season, the World Championship. He beat Kacper Filipiak, Mark Joyce and Alan McManus before losing to Barry Hawkins 4–10 in the final qualifying round.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He played in 11 of the 12 PTC events throughout the season, with his best finish coming in Event 9 where he reached the last 16. He was placed 66 on the PTC Order of Merit and finished the season ranked world number 71, outside of the top 64 who automatically retain their places on the tour for the 2012–13 season.\n2012/2013.\nMorris entered qualifying for the 2013 World Championship but lost 1–5 to Joe Swail in the second preliminary round.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the 2013 Q School to try and win a place back on the snooker tour and missed the final black for a 147 in his first match of the second event. Morris won through to the final round of that event but lost 0–4 to Ross Muir. He also reached the final round in the last event and this time succeeded by defeating Gareth Green 4–1 to earn a spot for the 2013–14 season.\n2013/2014.\nMorris began the 2013–14 season by qualifying for the 2013 Wuxi Classic, where he reached the quarter-finals in a ranking event for the first time in his career. He beat Gary Wilson 5–4, Gerard Greene 5–2 and survived a tense 37-minute final frame decider to see off Ali Carter 5–4.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He faced Matthew Stevens in the quarters and led 2–1 early on, but then did not score a point in the next three frames and went on to lose 5–2. Morris also had a very good run at the UK Championship with successes over Jamie Cope, 2002 world champion Peter Ebdon and Mitchell Travis, before losing 6–1 in the last 16 to Stuart Bingham. Morris was beaten in the first round of four more ranking events before the end of the season.\n2014/2015.\nIn the 2014–15 season, Morris qualified for the Wuxi Classic and the International Championship but lost in the first round of both tournaments. For the second successive year he reached the fourth round of the UK Championship, defeating Li Hang 6–4 in the first round before beating reigning world champion and world number one Mark Selby 6–4 in the second round, a victory that was described as the most significant win of his career to date. He went on to defeat David Gilbert 6–2 in the last 32, but lost 3–6 to Stephen Maguire in the last 16. Morris beat Joe O'Connor 4–0 at the Welsh Open, but lost by a reversal of this scoreline in the second round against Neil Robertson.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He qualified for the Indian Open and the China Open, losing 4–0 to Graeme Dott in the second round of the former and 5–1 to Stephen Maguire in the first round of the latter. Morris ended the season at a career-high 51st in the world rankings.\n2015/2016.\nAfter being knocked out in the third qualifying round of both the Australian Goldfields Open and Shanghai Masters, Morris could only win three more matches during the rest of the season. This meant he dropped off the tour as he finished the year 69th, outside the top 64 in the world rankings. Morris did not enter Q School."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, and Baltimore Orioles.\nHe played for the Newport Buffaloes high school team. Signed as an amateur free agent by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1940, Cox made his MLB debut with the Pirates on September 20, 1941, playing in ten games at shortstop that season before serving in the military during World War II.\nAfter returning to the Pirates, he was the starting shortstop in 1946 and 1947 before being traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers on December 8, 1947, along with Preacher Roe and Gene Mauch, for Dixie Walker, Hal Gregg and Vic Lombardi.\nCox was the third baseman of a Dodgers infield in the 1950s that included Gil Hodges, Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese.\nIn the 1953 World Series, Cox had a two-run double in Game 2 and a three-run homer in Game 5 against the New York Yankees. He batted .304 for the Series and led Brooklyn in runs batted in with six.\nCox was acquired along with Preacher Roe by the Baltimore Orioles from the Dodgers on December 14, 1954 for a pair of minor-leaguers, infielder Harry Schwegman and right-handed pitcher John Jancse, and $60,000. He was an infield starter (principally at third base) and leadoff hitter for the Orioles for the first half of 1955. He was traded along with Gene Woodling from the Orioles to the Cleveland Indians for Dave Pope, Wally Westlake and cash before the trade deadline on June 15, 1955. He would not report to his new team. Even after a meeting with Indians' manager Al López, Cox resolved to retire and did so on June 17.`\nIn 1058 games over 11 seasons, Cox posted a .262 batting average (974-for-3712) with 470 runs, 174 doubles, 32 triples, 66 home runs, 351 RBI, 42 stolen bases, .318 on-base percentage and .380 slugging percentage.

        "title": "Lacrosse stick",
        "text": "A lacrosse stick or crosse is used to play the sport of lacrosse. Players use the lacrosse stick to handle the ball and to strike or \"check\" opposing players' sticks, causing them to drop the ball. The head of a lacrosse stick is roughly triangular in shape and is strung with loose netting that allows the ball to be caught, carried (known as \"cradling\"), passed, or shot.\nHistory of lacrosse sticks.\nIndigenous stick history and variations.\nModern day lacrosse descends from and resembles games played by various Native American communities. Many of those games closely resemble what is now known as stickball. \nMany early stickball sticks were essentially giant wooden spoons with no netting. More advanced sticks featured one end being bent into a 4 to 5-inch diameter circle. This circle would have netting made of wattup, and later on deer sinew. The tension in the netting of the stick allowed for players to strike the ball as someone would do in tennis. These sticks were typically 2 to 5 feet long and were bent into shape after being softened with steam. This variation was played by many Great Lakes tribes. \nSome tribes would use two sticks to play. The player would carry the ball by sandwiching it between the two sticks. This two-stick variation was played by many southeastern and southwestern tribes. \nThe modern one-stick version of lacrosse is most closely modeled after the Iroquois. The sticks used by the Iroquois featured a U-shaped head rather than a circular one closely resembled the wooden sticks used today.\nTraditions and decorations.\nLacrosse sticks were often very treasured by their users. Players received a stick when they were born and were buried with their stick when they died. The practice still exists today to some degree, but Native Americans are not to be presented with or buried with a plastic modern lacrosse stick.\nMany stickball players decorated their sticks with the hair animals like horses or raccoons hoping to match that animals speed and agility.\nDuring grand matches or special events some players would decorate their sticks with feathers or dye their sticks different colors as a form of customization.\nSome sticks would have elaborate carvings on them for spiritual reasons.\nEarly production of lacrosse sticks (1880s-1968).\nSometime between 1884 and 1893, Frank Lally started the first lacrosse stick factory. He hired various native stickmakers to facilitate the assembly line style process. This company would close during World War Two and sold their equipment to the Chilsholm Lacrosse Manufacturing Company. During the great depression Colin Chisholm, and the Roundpoint brothers (who had worked in the Lally factory previously) started a competing lacrosse manufacturing company known as the Chisholm Lacrosse Manufacturing Company. This company operated on Cornwall Island, part of the Akwesasne Mohawk reserve, and had dozens of Mohawk stick makers working for it. At one point the Chisholm factory was believed to be producing as much as 97-percent of the worlds lacrosse sticks. They also supplied college teams and major lacrosse companies such as Brine with sticks. In 1968, the Chisholm factory burnt down. The ensuing shortage of lacrosse sticks likely sped up the transition to plastic lacrosse sticks.\nIn 1937, Robert Pool designed the first double walled stick head, it was not used at the time but the design influenced the creation of today's plastic lacrosse heads.\nProduction of the modern lacrosse stick.\nPre-1970.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s companies such as Brine and STX began experimenting with different materials to develop lacrosse sticks. The Brine company was founded in early 1920s and had developed other wooden sticks. It also experimented with materials such as laminated wood, fibreglass, plastic, and aluminum. STX was founded in the 1960s in Baltimore by lacrosse players working for WT Burnett, a plastics company. They were experimenting with various lighter synthetic materials. Brine settled on a Dupont plastic called \"Surlyn\", while STX settled on Dupont \"Adiprene\" urethane rubber.\n1970s.\nOn April 21, 1970, STX was issued the patent for the first plastic head. The head was placed onto a wooden shaft. Since the stick was symmetrical in shape, it could be used by both left-handed and right-handed individuals, as opposed to traditional sticks which had different designs depending on handedness. The stick was triangular in shape and did not feature the \"pinched\" sidewalls, where the stick remains narrow throughout the bottom and middle of the head and widens near the top, we now see on modern lacrosse sticks. These sticks were also what is now referred to as \"non-offset\" or \"onset\". Offset lacrosse heads would be introduced in the mid-1990s and is extremely common on newer lacrosse heads.\nEarly lacrosse sticks were extremely basic with little complexity in selecting equipment. Players essentially only needed to select the brand of stick they wanted, and from their selected the stick that brand offered for their position.\nOn July 2, 1974 the patent was granted to STX for pocket mesh. By the 1980s, mesh had largely replaced traditional mesh as the preferred stick stringing method.\n1980s.\nIn the early 1980s, the first aluminum shafts were developed. The hollow aluminum shafts were lighter than wood and thus led to significantly faster stick movement, shots, and passes.\nIn the 1981 Brine released the Brine \"Magnum\" which was an early attempt at a pinched head. In the late-1980s, Brine released the Brine \"Shotgun\" and the \"Shotgun II\" which further developed the pinched head idea.\n1990s.\nThe offset head.\nOn August 18, 1995, Brine filed the patent for the \"scooped\" head which featured what we now know as offset. As shown in the original patent, offset is when sidewall curves in order to form a scoop-like shape. \nOn December 5, 1995 Brine filed the patent for the Brine \"Edge\", it would be the first head to feature an offset design and it quickly began to dominate the playing space. The patent for the offset in the Brine Edge was slightly different than original offset patent, it featured sidewalls that extended from a lower point of the base rather than simply curving from the top of the base. \nThe creation of offset technology was revolutionary technology for lacrosse heads, it allowed for the ball to sit lower on the axis of the shaft which increased control and feel for the ball. Within a few years offset sticks became the norm. STX responded to the issue of offset heads by creating their own similar technology known as \"Forward Cant\". STX created both shafts and heads with forward cant. The shafts with forward cant would face no issues, the heads however, were similar to Brines offset technology and would face legal issues.\nIn 1999, Brine filed a patent infringement against STX for their three offset (or forward cant) heads: the \"X2\", the \"Proton\", and the \"Octane\". After trial, it was ruled that STX had willingly infringed on the patent of the Brine Edge and awarded damages in favor of Brine. STX was also barred from selling their three offset heads, however the X2 and the Proton would later go on to have other variations made.\nTraditional stick.\nA wood lacrosse stick is usually crafted from hickory trees. The lacrosse stick is given its shape through steam bending. Holes are drilled in the top portion of the head and the sidewall (\"i.e.\", the side of the stick head), permitting weaving of string, which is then hardened by dipping them in resin. Leather \"runners\" are strung from the top of the \"head\" to the \"throat\" of the stick. Then nylon string is woven in to create the pocket.\nThe wooden lacrosse stick dates back to the creation of the sport and is still made by craftsmen around the world. Though modern lacrosse sticks made of plastic have become the overwhelming choice for contemporary lacrosse players, traditional wooden lacrosse sticks are still commonly used by box lacrosse goaltenders, senior and masters players, and by women's field lacrosse players. Wooden sticks are still legal under Canadian Lacrosse Association, NCAA, and World Lacrosse rules but are subject to the same size regulations as modern lacrosse sticks. The only exception to this is the Western Lacrosse Association, which prohibited the use of wooden sticks by non-goaltenders some years ago. The last WLA player to use one was A.J. Smith of the Coquitlam Adanacs, c. 2003–04, who had been grandfathered.\nMen's modern stick.\nHead.\nIn 1970, the first patent (US Patent #3,507,495) for a synthetic lacrosse stick was issued to STX. A modern lacrosse stick consists of a plastic molded head attached to a metal or composite shaft. The head is strung with nylon or leather strings to form a pocket. The dimensions of the stick (length, width, sidewall height, and depth of the pocket) are governed by league rules, such as NCAA rules for collegiate players or World Lacrosse rules for international players.\nFor field players in men's lacrosse, the head of the stick must be wide at its widest point under NCAA rules. In order to prevent the ball from being stuck in the crosse, the two sidewalls cannot be any closer than 3 inches at any point between 1.25 inches from the throat of the head, to 5 inches from the throat of the head. When it reaches 5 inches from the throat of the head, the sidewalls may be between 3.5 inches apart and 4 inches apart on the front of the head, and must be 3.5 inches apart on the back of the head. The head of the stick must also be a minimum of 10 inches in length; length is measured from the outside of the head to the beginning of the throat.\nThe head of the goalie's stick is much larger and must be between 10 and 12 inches wide under NCAA rules or up to 15 inches (38 cm) wide under World Lacrosse rules. A goalie head may not exceed 16.5 inches in length. \nThe sidewalls of the head may not be more than two inches (5 cm) tall for all sticks.\nThe flat table test states that, when laid flat on a table facedown, the furthest point from the tabletop cannot exceed 2.75 inches.\nPocket.\nThe pocket of the head is where the ball is carried and caught. It consists of interwoven string attached to the head. Traditional stringing with leather strings interwoven with nylon has declined in popularity in favor of synthetic mesh stringing. Mesh is typically made of nylon and comes in a variety of diamond configurations, which can affect the pocket's throwing and retention characteristics.\nThe typical mesh pocket uses four main nylon strings to affix the mesh piece to the head: a topstring, two sidewalls, and a bottom string. The topstring is often made of a slightly thicker string, in order to resist the abrasive forces that come from scooping the ball up. The sidewalls are used to affix individual mesh diamonds to the sidewall holes on the sidewall of the head. The sidewalls have the most effect on the pocket's performance, as they dictate the placement of the pocket in the head, the tightness of the channel of the pocket, and even the pocket depth. The bottom string is used to fine-tune the pocket depth, and serves to keep the ball from slipping through the bottom of the pocket.\nIn addition to the four strings used to affix the mesh piece, shooting strings are woven through the diamonds of the mesh in order to help fine-tune the pocket's characteristics. They can either be made of typical nylon string, or a hockey style lace. Shooting strings are often used in straight, U, or V shapes. They serve to increase the pocket's hold on the ball, as well as fine-tune the way the stick throws. They can act to change the tension of various portions of the pocket, helping to create a \"ramp\" for the ball to roll along as it exits the pocket.\nAs of the 2013 season, the NCAA has passed a rule stating that shooting strings are limited to an area within a 4-inch (10 cm) arc drawn from the top of the plastic of the scoop. This essentially eliminates U- or V-shaped shooting strings, as they almost always cross below the 4-inch (10 cm) line. The pocket depth is governed by rule as well. When the ball is placed in the deepest point, the top of the ball must not be below the bottom of the sidewall. This rule does not apply to the goalie's stick.\nShaft.\nModern handles, more commonly referred to as \"shafts\", are made of hollow metal. They are usually octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of aluminum, titanium, scandium, or alloy, but some shafts are still made from other materials, including wood, plastic, or fiberglass. The open end of the hollow shaft must be covered with tape or a plug (commonly referred to as the \"butt\" or \"butt end\" of the stick), usually made of rubber. The head of the stick is usually attached to the shaft with a screw to keep it in place.\nStick length is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men's sticks (including the head) be from 40 to 42 inches (102 to 107 cm) long for offensive players, 52 to 72 inches (132 to 183 cm) long for defensemen, and 40 to 72 inches (102 to 183 cm) long for goalies. Offensive players usually prefer their sticks to be the minimum length (40 inches or 102 cm) in order to give them the advantage of having a shorter stick to protect from defensive checks. Conversely, defensive players usually prefer their sticks to be the maximum length (72 inches or 183 cm) to permit them the greatest range in covering their offensive player.\nIn 2016, a rules clarification was made by the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Rules Committee. Questions have arisen regarding the alteration of the shaft circumference. The circumference of the shaft cannot exceed 3 1/2\" (8.9 cm). To be clear, added tape to the shaft must not make the shaft exceed this circumference measurement.\nWomen's modern stick.\nThis section uses the World Lacrosse official women's field lacrosse rule book. There may be differences in exact measurements throughout different levels of play.\nHead.\nNCAA rules dictate that the head of a woman's stick may be from seven to nine inches wide at its widest point. World Lacrosse rules require the widest point of the head to be a minimum of 16 centimeters or roughly 6.3 inches for plastic heads. The inside width of the stick must continually increase from the ball stop to the widest point of the head. \nGoalie sticks have a maximum length of 42 centimeters (16.5 inches). The sidewall height must be a minimum of 2.54 centimeters (1 inch) and a maximum of 5.1 centimeters (2 inches). \nPocket.\nUp until 2018, nylon mesh was not permitted in women's sticks, although traditional stringing remains a popular option. When strung traditionally, the pocket is allowed to have between two and five runners, and between eight and twelve stitches of cross-lacing. Each runner must run the full length of the head. The stringing of the stick must be attached to the bottom of the sidewall as opposed to the top.\nWomen's lacrosse sticks are permitted to have two shooting strings. The top shooting string must be attached to the top-third of the head. Unlike in men's lacrosse, the bottom shooting string may be in an \"inverted U\" shape so long as the shooting string connects to the side wall in the top-half of the head.\nThe legal depth of a women's stick pocket is determined by the following test: the top of the lacrosse ball, when placed in the pocket, must remain above the top edge of the sidewall.\nThe rules for stringing a goalie stick differ from a field players stick. When a goalie stick is strung traditionally, they are required to have 6 or 7 runners, while also using eight to twelve stitches of cross-lacing. A goalie has no restrictions for the placement or design of shooter strings so long as the ball can move freely in the stick. A goalie stick may have unlimited pocket depth so long as the ball can move freely. \nShaft.\nWomen's sticks are allowed to be 35.5 to 43.25 inches (90 to 110 cm) long. Goalies may play with a shaft that is 90 to 135 centimeters (35.4 to 53.1 inches) long. Players under the age of 15 are allowed to use sticks shorter than 90 centimeters so that play can be more comfortable. Shafts may be constructed of wood, metal-alloy, or another composite material.

Dixon played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Chicago Black Hawks, Montreal Maroons, Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Eagles, Boston Bruins and New York Americans between 1927 and 1937. Prior to turning professional Graham played for the Owen Sound Greys, winning the 1924 Memorial Cup as Canadian junior champions.\nPlaying career.\nAs a junior player Graham played for the Owen Sound Greys, helping them win the 1924 Memorial Cup as Canadian junior champions. He played two seasons of senior hockey before he turning professional in 1926, signing with the Chicago Cardinals of the American Hockey Association. He played for the team for one year, and after they folded Graham moved cross-town to the Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Graham's NHL debut came on November 15, 1927, against the Boston Bruins, and his first goal, and only point of the season, was on January 4, 1928, against the Montreal Canadiens.\nPartway through the season Graham was traded to the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Prairie Hockey League in January 1928, though Moose Jaw traded him the same day to the Saskatoon Sheiks, where Graham finished the 1927–28 season with. He then signed with the Tulsa Oilers of the AHA, and spent the 1928–29 and most of the 1929–30 seasons there before being traded back to the Black Hawks. Graham remained with Chicago until 1933 when he was traded to the Montreal Maroons, where he played 19 games before being traded in January 1934 to the Detroit Red Wings. With the Red Wings he played 52 games over two seasons, as well as 7 games for their International Hockey League affiliate, the Detroit Olympics, before being traded again, this time to the St. Louis Eagles, where he played the last 13 games of the 1934–35 season.\nThe Eagles folded after the season and the players were dispersed to the other NHL teams, with Graham being selected by the Boston Bruins. He would play the 1935–36 season and the first game of the 1936–37 season with the Bruins, scoring four goals and one assist in 49 games, before being traded to the New York Americans, where he finished the 1936–37 season with, playing 31 games. Graham played a further season in the International American Hockey League before retiring in 1938. Graham subsequently became an ice hockey referee.\nGraham played in two Stanley Cup Finals during his career. The first was in 1931 Stanley Cup Finals with Chicago, who lost to the Montreal Canadiens. He reached the finals again in 1934 with Detroit, joined by former Owen Sound teammate Cooney Weiland, but lost to the Black Hawks."

        "text": "The 2001 Giro d'Italia was the 84th edition of the Giro. It began with a prologue that went from Montesilvano to Pescara. The race came to a close on June 10 with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Twenty teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Gilberto Simoni of the team. Second and third were the Spanish riders Abraham Olano and Unai Osa.\nIn the race's other classifications, rider Fredy González won the mountains classification, Massimo Strazzer of the team won the intergiro classification and the points classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was also won by .\nTeams.\nA total of 20 teams were invited to participate in the 2001 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 180 cyclists. Out of the 180 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 136 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe 20 teams that took part in the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 2001 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano and organizers RCS Sport on 11 November 2000 in Milan at the Verdi theatre. It contained two time trial events, both of which were individual. In the stages containing categorized climbs, four had summit finishes: stage 4, to Mercogliano; stage 13, to Passo Pordoi; and stage 18, to Santuario. The organizers chose to include one rest day. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained the same amount of rest days, and one less individual time trial. In addition, this race had an opening prologue like the year before. It was the longest Grand Tour of the season.\nThe race will only leave Italy once during its twenty-two racing days as it enters Slovenia where the day finishes in Ljubljana. The lone rest day came after sixteen racing days, on 5 June.\nA \"Cycling News\" writer felt there were two very tough stages in the race, stages 13 and stage 18. In particular the writer felt the two passes of the Passo Pordoi and the climbs of Passo Rolle and Passo Fedaia made stage 13 particularly difficult. The eighteenth stage contained the Cima Coppi Colle Fauniera which was an climb with an average gradient of 9.5%. The previous year's winner Garzelli described the route to be a \"hard Giro, but not the hardest.\" Pantani said it was an \"uncertain Giro\" and that the limited time trial distances and fewer climbing kilometers would help Jan Ullrich. Former winner Three-time winner Felice Gimondi agreed with Pantani regarding Ullrich and the route, stating that \"it should make certain the presence of Ullrich.\" Cipollini commented that it's a \"Giro with something for everyone.\"\nClassification Leadership.\nIn the 2001 Giro d'Italia, five different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2001 was the Colle Fauniera, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the intergiro classification, marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Italian Massimo Strazzer won the Most Combative classification. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. Mario Cipollini won the Azzurri d'Italia classification. Paolo Savoldelli won the combination classification.\nDoping cases.\nDuring the Giro, test for EPO performed on Sergio Barbero in the 2001 Tour of Romandie came back positive. For this reason, Barbero did not start the twelfth stage, pending confirmation of his penalty.\nRiccardo Forconi and Pascal Hervé tested positive for EPO, and were not allowed to start stage 17.\nAfter stage 17, the Italian police held a doping raid in the cyclists' hotels. Doping was found in Dario Frigo's room, and he was removed from the race, and banned for 6 months.\nNoan Lelarge tested positive for a banned steroid, and was consequently fired by his team ."

It was decided in three matches which drew a total attendance of 180,074. Queensland won the series 2-1, their first outright series victory since 2001 and the first in their record-breaking run of eight consecutive series wins. Prior to game one there was growing concern about the long term future of State of Origin, many commentators were beginning to wonder if Queensland would ever win another series after three consecutive New South Wales victories.\nGame I.\nCraig Gower was originally picked for the New South Wales side at halfback but pulled out because of injury. Matt Orford was forced to turn down selection as cover for Gower, also because of injury. Both Andrew Johns and Trent Barrett turned down coming out of retirement to play in the fixture so eventually Brett Finch was selected to start at halfback in jersey no. 20 for New South Wales as a last-minute inclusion.\nThe Queensland selectors picked a total of seven State of Origin debutants for game I.\nGame I was played at Telstra Stadium, Sydney, and won by New South Wales 17-16, following a late field goal by NSW late-choice halfback, Brett Finch.\nGame II.\nFor Queensland, Origin debutant Adam Mogg replaced the injured Greg Inglis\nIn game II, Queensland levelled the series at home at Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane, with a commanding 30-6 victory.\nGame III.\nJustin Hodges was ruled out of the Queensland side for game III after he re-tore his hamstring and was replaced by Josh Hannay. Steven Bell was also ruled out after he sustained a fractured cheekbone in game II.\nAfter the heavy loss in game II the New South Wales selectors made five changes, bringing in Matt Cooper, Paul Gallen, Craig Gower, Luke O'Donnell and Ben Hornby as well as moving Matt King into the centres, Mark Gasnier to five-eighth and Luke Bailey into the starting side.\nGame III was held at Telstra Dome, Melbourne, and was the first decider played at a neutral venue. Queensland were trailing 14-4 with ten minutes remaining, however scored two converted tries in the space of five minutes – first Brent Tate's long-range try after a line break from Thurston and then Lockyer intercepting a Hodgson pass inside New South Wales' own half – to take the match and series, winning 16-14."

        "text": "Andrew Mulligan Green (born July 7, 1977) is an American former professional baseball utility player and manager who is currently a member of the front office for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is a former manager of the San Diego Padres and has also served as third base coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks and bench coach of the Chicago Cubs.\nHe was a versatile fielder, who had the ability to play in almost all of the positions in baseball. After making his debut, he played second base, third base, shortstop, and in the outfield. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed as an active player.\nHe was a consistent .300 hitter in the minor leagues, won a Pacific Coast League MVP award, and played in the majors for three years with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After a year with the Nippon Ham Fighters in Japan, he played in the Cincinnati Reds organization and returned to the Major Leagues for a brief time in 2009 with the New York Mets.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur career.\nAndy Green was named Kentucky High School Scholar-Athlete of the Year and National Christian Scholar-Athlete of the Year in 1996 and also served as his high school class valedictorian. He attended the University of Kentucky on an academic scholarship. He earned a BA in business administration (finance), graduating Summa Cum Laude (3.89 GPA). He broke five school records at UK and set longstanding school records in hits (277) and runs scored (199). As a senior in 2000, he batted .368 with a slugging percentage of .603 and stole 27 bases. He was inducted into the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame in 2015. The Arizona Diamondbacks took him in the 24th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft.\n2000–2003: Minors.\nGreen spent most of his first pro season with the Missoula Osprey, hitting .229/.324/.277 and going 8 for 11 in steals. He was 0 for 9 in 3 games for the South Bend Silver Hawks. Arizona did not let him go, though, and he improved in 2001, batting .300/.379/.394 for South Bend and stealing 51 of 66 bases. He was 60 steals behind Midwest League (MWL) leader Chris Morris but led MWL second basemen in fielding percentage (.973), putouts (234), assists (336) and double plays (63) and was selected by \"Baseball America\" as MWL Best Defensive Second Baseman.\nIn 2002, Green hit .222/.294/.333 in a 27-game glance at Triple-A with the Tucson Sidewinders but spent most of the year in High-A, where the 24/25-year-old batted .309/.401/.464 with the Lancaster JetHawks. He drove 36 doubles and had 15 steals but was thrown out 10 times. His 44 doubles between the two teams put him 5th in the minor leagues that year. He was three doubles away from the California League lead and was 5th in the league in batting average. On August 21, he hit for the cycle, going 4 for 5 with a 9th-inning homer to seal the deal; it was one of just six home runs he clubbed that year for Lancaster.\nGreen had his third .300 stop in 2003 with the El Paso Diablos, posting a .302/.366/.400 line, doubling 38 times (only four other extra-base hits) and stealing 17 in 26 tries. He tied Justin Leone for the Texas League lead in doubles and was third in average, trailing Ramón Nivar and Jake Weber.\n2004–2006: Tucson and Arizona.\nAndy returned to Tucson in 2004 and hit .327/.394/.534 with 31 doubles in 77 games. That earned him a call-up to the Diamondbacks, where he only managed a .202/.241/.266 line in 46 games as a backup infielder. His first big-league hit was a pinch-hit homer against José Contreras. Green had his biggest minor league season in 2005. He batted .343/.422/.587 with the Sidewinders with 46 doubles, 13 triples, 19 homers and 125 runs in 135 games while rapping 182 hits. In addition to second, he played third, short and the outfield. He led the Pacific Coast League in runs, hits, total bases (311), doubles and triples and was 6th in average. He reached base in 54 consecutive games at one point and almost doubled his career home run total. He tied for 8th in the minors in average, scored 11 more runs than any other minor league that year, was second in the minors in hits, second in total bases, tied for third in doubles and second in extra-base hits. \"Baseball America\" named him a second-team minor league All-Star behind Howie Kendrick among second basemen on the farm and the top 2B in AAA. He was named to the PCL All-Star team at second base and won the league MVP award.\nIn a September call-up to Arizona, Andy managed a .226/.359/.258 line in 17 games.\nGreen won the final spot on the 2006 Diamondbacks roster but was rarely used, hitting .186/.293/.267 as a backup infielder and in the difficult role of pinch-hitting (though he batted .234/.345/.362 in 56 pinch-hit games). He only got nine starts during the year. He also briefly appeared with Tucson in a rehab stint, batting only .240/.288/.320 in 18 games there. That year, he was honored by the Kentucky State legislature, which proclaimed him an \"outstanding citizen of the Commonwealth and an exemplary role model for the young student athletes in the Bluegrass State.\"\n2007: Japan.\nAfter the 2006 season ended, Andy began a long series of negotiations with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, who had just won the 2006 Japan Series but had lost star Michihiro Ogasawara to free agency and outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo to retirement. In late November, Arizona, sold Green's rights to Nippon Ham, which signed him for a $50,000 bonus and $660,000 salary for 2007. There was an option for Nippon Ham for 2008 for $850,000 with a $100,000 buyout clause.\nGreen battled injuries and spent much of his Japanese term in \"ni-gun\". He was placed on waivers in late August.\n2008–2009: Return to the majors.\nLate in 2007, Green was signed by the Cincinnati Reds. He began the 2008 season with the Louisville Bats, where he hit .233 in 71 games. He was released on July 1, then was picked up by the New York Mets organization, where he suddenly started hitting very well. He batted .331 with 8 home runs (13 on the season) in 52 games with the New Orleans Zephyrs of the PCL to give the Mets a reason to keep him for another year. He returned to the Major Leagues for 4 games with the Mets in 2009, going 1 for 4. It pushed his lifetime Major League batting average above the Mendoza line. He spent most of the season with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, hitting .259 in 50 games. He spent the majority of the season on the disabled list and had rehabilitation assignments with the GCL Mets and the Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York–Penn League.\nOn January 5, 2010, Green signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the New York Mets. He was released after the season.\nCoach and managerial career.\nGreen led the Missoula Osprey to the Pioneer League Championship in 2012.\nIn 2013, after leading the Mobile BayBears to consecutive first and second half division titles, he was named Southern League's Manager of the Year. Green was named the 2014 Southern League manager of the year and was the first manager in Southern League history to win that award in consecutive years.\nIn 2015, Green served as the third base coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nAfter spending one season as a third base coach for the Diamondbacks, on October 29, 2015, Green was named manager of the San Diego Padres. Green's first managerial ejection occurred on April 19, 2016, during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. After a balk was called on Padres pitcher Colin Rea, then reversed, then called again, Green came out to argue with umpires Mark Carlson and Brian Gorman. Gorman eventually ejected Green, and Green had to be escorted back to the dugout by bench coach Mark McGwire. Green's first season was marred by a rebuild, as the Padres front office traded away veterans James Shields, Melvin Upton Jr., and Matt Kemp, leading to a 68–94 season.\nOn August 13, 2017, the San Diego Padres announced that they had extended Green through the 2021 season.\nGreen was fired by the Padres on September 21, 2019. The team had posted a 69–85 record under him up to that point in the season and a 274–366 record overall during his tenure. Bench coach Rod Barajas replaced Green as interim manager for the remainder of the season.\nOn December 9, 2019, Green was hired as the bench coach of the Chicago Cubs under new manager David Ross. Upon the hiring of Craig Counsell to replace Ross, Green departed the Cubs and joined the Mets organization within the team's front office. He now serves as the team's Senior Vice President for Player Development."

He made his senior debut at 15 for the Peterborough Pirates in the British National League. He made 13 appearances for the club throughout the season, scoring one goal.\nClarke spent each of the next five seasons playing for the Pirates, totalling 96 points from 135 appearances. He made his debut for the national team in the 1999 World Junior Championships before being promoted into the full seniors a year later. There was a rumour that Clarke would become only the second ever British trained player drafted into the NHL but was passed over in the draft for his lack of size.\nIn 2000, Clarke signed for Superleague side Newcastle Jesters. British players were a rarity in the league at the time and Clarke earned seven points from forty-one appearances. In 2001, financial problems at Newcastle saw Clarke move to the London Knights, where he scored three points from ten appearances.\nIn 2002, Clarke moved back to the British National League by joining the Guildford Flames, scoring forty-nine points in forty-one appearances.\nWhen the Superleague folded during the summer of 2003, the remaining clubs formed the Elite Ice Hockey League. Clarke was signed by the Nottingham Panthers where he became a fan favourite taking thirty points from forty four games in his first season and sixty-one from sixty in his second. In 2005–06, Clarke re-signed for the third season in Nottingham, totalling 26 points from forty-four appearances.\nIn the 2006–07 season Clarke re-signed again under new Coach Mike Ellis and Assistant Coach Calle Carllson, Clarke was also named captain following a player vote.\nFor the 2007–08 season, Clarke played for Alleghe in Italy before re-signing for the Nottingham Panthers for the 2008–09 season.\nClarke was re-signed by Nottingham for the 2009/10 season where he helped the Panthers win the Challenge cup and qualify for the final four of the Elite league playoffs. The Panthers finished third in the league standings for 2009/10.\nAfter the 2010 playoffs, Clarke left with the Team GB squad for the Division 1 World championships in Slovenia where they would end up finishing in fourth position. The GB team fell foul of the volcanic ash cloud that cancelled flights throughout Europe at this time and had to endure a 27-hour bus journey from England to Slovenia.\nOn 21 April 2010, the Nottingham Panthers issued a press release stating that Clarke had signed again for the Nottingham club for the forthcoming 2010/2011 season.\nClarke wears the number 5 as his preference.\nDavid Clarke officially retired after the 2017/18 EIHL season."

The Giro began with a prologue that navigated through the streets of the Dutch city Groningen. The race came to a close with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Twenty-two teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Paolo Savoldelli of the Index Alexia team. Second and third were the American Tyler Hamilton and Italian Pietro Caucchioli.\nIn the race's other classifications, rider Julio Alberto Pérez won the mountains classification, Massimo Strazzer of the team won the intergiro classification, and Acqua &amp; Sapone rider Mario Cipollini won the points classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the twenty-two teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was also won by Alessio.\nTeams.\nA total of 22 teams were invited to participate in the 2002 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198 cyclists. Out of the 198 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 140 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe 22 teams that took part in the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 2002 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 17 November 2001 in Milan. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. In the stages containing categorized climbs, four had summit finishes: stage 5, to Limone Piemonte; stage 11, to Campitello Matese; stage 13, to San Giacomo; and stage 17, to Passo Coe. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained one more rest day, and one more individual time trial. In addition, this race had an opening prologue like the year before.\nClassification Leadership.\nIn the 2002 Giro d'Italia, five different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2002 was the Passo Pordoi, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the intergiro classification, marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Italian Massimo Strazzer won the Most Combative classification. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was won by Mario Cipollini. The \"Trofeo Fuga Piaggio\" classification rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. The classification was won by Mariano Piccoli. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. was the most successful in avoiding penalties after not being penalized during the race, and so won the Fair Play classification."

        "text": "William Augustus \"Dub\" Jones (born December 29, 1924) is an American former professional football player who was a halfback for ten seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and the old All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily for the Cleveland Browns. He shares the NFL record for touchdowns scored in a single game, with six.\nJones was born into an athletic family in Louisiana and played a variety of sports, including football, at his high school in Ruston. The team won the state championship in 1941, his senior year. Jones attended Louisiana State University on a scholarship for a year before being transferred to Tulane University in New Orleans as part of a World War II-era U.S. Navy training program. He played football at Tulane for two seasons before joining the Miami Seahawks of the new AAFC in 1946.\nThe Seahawks traded Jones at the end of the 1946 season to the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers, who subsequently sent him to the Browns before the 1948 season. That year, the Browns won all of their games and the AAFC championship. The team repeated as champions in 1949, but the AAFC dissolved at the end of the year and the Browns joined the NFL. A tall flanker back who was both a running and receiving threat, Jones was a key part of Browns teams that won NFL championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955. He was twice named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game, including in 1951, when he set his touchdown record.\nJones retired after the 1955 season, but returned to the Browns as an assistant coach in 1963. The Browns won the NFL championship the following year. Jones left football for good in 1968 and went back to Ruston, where he worked with one of his sons in a general contracting business. Jones is a member of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame and the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame.\nEarly life and college.\nJones was born in Arcadia, Louisiana, but moved with his mother and three brothers to nearby Ruston after his father died when he was three years old. He played Little League Baseball as a child and went to watch boxing matches and baseball and football games at the nearby Louisiana Tech University.\nJones attended Ruston High School starting in 1938, and played football under head coach L.J. \"Hoss\" Garrett. He was small in stature and did not make the first team until his senior year in 1941. Ruston's Bearcats football team won its first-ever state championship that year, with Jones playing left halfback and tailback. Jones also played baseball and basketball and boxed in high school.\nAfter graduating, Jones got a scholarship to attend Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, where one of his brothers played football. He stayed there for a year before joining the U.S. Navy as American involvement in World War II intensified. The Navy transferred him to a V-12 training program at Tulane University in New Orleans, where he played as a halfback and a safety in 1943 and 1944.\nJones carried the football for a total of 700 yards of rushing and scored four touchdowns in 1944, his junior year, and was named an All-American and an All-Southeastern Conference player by sportswriters. He trained as a fireman aboard submarines while in the Navy, and in 1945 he played football for a military team at the Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut. Before beginning his professional career, he played in the 1946 Chicago College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual contest between the National Football League champion and a squad of the country's best college players. Led by quarterback and future teammate Otto Graham, the college players beat the Los Angeles Rams 16–0 that year.\nProfessional career.\nJones was selected by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies. When the Miami Seahawks of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) offered him a $12,000 contract, however, he accepted it and joined the team. The Seahawks won just three games in 1946, the AAFC's first season of play, and Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers, another AAFC team, in December. The Seahawks, meanwhile, folded and were moved to Baltimore after the season because of poor attendance and shaky finances. Jones played sparingly for the Dodgers in the last three games of the 1946 season, rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries.\nThe Dodgers traded for Jones in part to replace Glenn Dobbs – a star tailback in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries. Jones himself was hurt early in the 1947 season, however, when he was hit by Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns. Injuries to his knee, hip and clavicle forced him to sit out for several weeks. He broke his hand when he returned and had to play exclusively on defense for the rest of the season.\nPaul Brown, the head coach of the Browns, was impressed with Jones's defensive play for Brooklyn, and traded away the rights to University of Michigan star Bob Chappuis to acquire him in June 1948. Jones began his career with the Browns as a defensive back, but was switched to halfback early in the 1948 season because his performance on defense wasn't up to Brown's standards. Jones played on offense alongside Graham, the team's quarterback, and star fullback Marion Motley as the Browns won all of their games in 1948 and beat the Buffalo Bills for their third straight AAFC championship. He ended the year with 149 rushing yards on 33 carries.\nOver the next two seasons, Jones developed into a star flanker, a position he helped invent. He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two main ends, Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Jones often went in motion behind the line of scrimmage before the snap at a time when few players did so, causing confusion and mismatches on defense. He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.\nJones came into his own in the 1950 season, when the Browns joined the NFL following the dissolution of the AAFC. Cleveland won the NFL championship against the Rams that year, helped by Jones's skill receiving short passes underneath opponents' coverage. Jones had 31 receptions and 11 rushing and receiving touchdowns in 1950.\nJones continued to excel in 1951, scoring 12 touchdowns and amassing a career-high 1,062 yards from scrimmage. He tied an NFL record in a November 25 game by scoring six touchdowns - 4 rushing, 2 receiving - in a 42-21 win over the Chicago Bears, a single-game record he shares with Ernie Nevers (1929), Gale Sayers (1965), and Alvin Kamara (2020). The Browns finished the season with an 11–1 win–loss record and advanced to the championship game, but lost this time to the Rams. Jones came in second in the NFL in touchdowns scored and was named to the Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game. He was also selected by sportswriters as a first-team All-Pro. \"Dub has the speed, the guts and the know-how of a great player,\" Paul Brown said at the time, calling him \"the most underrated player in the league.\"\nJones made the Pro Bowl again in 1952, when he had 952 total yards and six touchdowns. Cleveland advanced to the NFL championship for the third time in a row that year, losing 17–7 to the Detroit Lions. In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns, and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for two more years, winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good. He pulled his hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season, an injury that caused him to miss several games and bothered him all season.\nLater life and coaching career.\nJones spent seven years working at his business in Ruston after leaving the Browns. He worked briefly as a special instructor for the Houston Oilers and an occasional advisor to college programs in Louisiana, but otherwise was out of football. He returned to the Browns as an assistant coach, however, in March 1963 after Paul Brown was fired by team owner Art Modell. Blanton Collier, Brown's long-time deputy, became head coach and put Jones in charge of the receivers. Jones and Collier had been close during his playing days, and Collier considered him an astute student of the game.\nUnder Collier, Jones supervised the offensive backfield and the ends, but was also the Browns' offensive play-caller. He directed the team from the press box on Collier's behalf because Collier was hard of hearing and could not do so himself. The Browns won their first six games at the beginning of Jones's coaching career in the 1963 season, although a late slump cost them a spot in the championship game. The team regrouped the following year, ending with a 10–3–1 win–loss–tie record and winning the NFL's eastern division. Cleveland went on to win the championship game against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The Browns advanced to the championship game again the following year, but lost to the Green Bay Packers. During his tenure as a coach, Jones was the primary position coach for running backs Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly, both of whom are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also coached receiver Paul Warfield, another hall of fame member who helped propel the Browns to the 1964 championship.\nJones stayed with the Browns until early 1968, when he quit and was replaced by Nick Skorich. The Browns had offered him a part-time coaching job but made clear that he could not stay on as offensive coordinator; Jones declined the reduced role. After leaving the Browns, Jones moved back to Ruston and did occasional scouting for the team at the nearby Grambling State University. He was also a volunteer coach of receivers on Grambling's football team. Later in life, he worked for his son Tom's general contracting business in Ruston.\nJones was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1982 and the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame in 1984. He is the father of former NFL quarterback Bert Jones, who played 10 seasons in the 1970s and 1980s for the Baltimore Colts and Los Angeles Rams and won the NFL's most valuable player award in 1976. Jones and his wife, Schump, have seven children, including four sons who played college football."

        "text": "Bradley John Nelson (born December 23, 1982) is an American former professional baseball player. He played primarily first base and outfield in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers.\nHigh school.\nNelson played high school baseball at Bishop Garrigan High School in Algona, Iowa. He was a pitcher and utility infielder. He started varsity halfway through his eighth grade summer and led the team to the state championship game as a sophomore. The team he played on that season continues to hold the state records for most runs (523), home runs (90), and RBIs (461) in a season; Nelson himself holds the state records for most hits (83) and most RBIs (91) in a season.\nProfessional career.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nHe was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fourth round of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft.\nNelson has played professionally for the Rookie Level Arizona League Brewers and Ogden Raptors, the Single-A Beloit Snappers and High Desert Mavericks, the Double-A Huntsville Stars, and the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. He was part of the Sounds team that won the Pacific Coast League championship.\nHe was selected to play in the Midwest League All-Star game in Lansing, Michigan, and the Southern League All-Star Game in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In both all-star appearances, he won the home run derby that was part of the All-Star festivities. He was also named the Milwaukee Brewers' 2002 Minor League Player of the Year, after leading all minor leaguers with 116 RBIs and 49 doubles at the age of 19.\nIn addition to his positive career statistics, Nelson also holds the Pacific Coast League record for most strikeouts in a single game, with seven strike-outs in 11 plate appearances in a 24-inning game (the longest game in PCL history) in which the Nashville Sounds played against the New Orleans Zephyrs on May 5 and 6, .\nFor the season, he played with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, but was called up to the Brewers on September 1; he made his major league debut that afternoon. On September 2, Nelson collected his first major league hit, a pinch-hit double in the 10th inning against Luis Ayala of the New York Mets. After a successful 2009 spring training, the Brewers kept Nelson on the 25-man roster to start the following year. However, after going hitless in 21 at-bats primarily as a pinch hitter to start the season, Nelson was outrighted to AAA, and replaced with infielder Mat Gamel, on May 14. Rather than report back to the Brewers' minor league system, Nelson opted for free agency the next day.\nSeattle Mariners.\nAfter spending eight years in the Brewers organization, with 28 games at the major league level, Nelson signed a minor-league contract with the Seattle Mariners on May 19, 2009. After spending the rest of 2009 with the Mariners' top farm club, the Tacoma Rainiers, Nelson signed another minor-league deal with the Mariners on January 14, 2010, and was again invited to spring training with the club. Like in Milwaukee, a crowded first base caused the Mariners to cut Nelson on March 13, 2010, and send him to their minor league camp. He spent the entire 2010 season in Tacoma, and became a free agent on November 6, 2010.\nTexas Rangers.\nNelson played in the Texas Rangers organization in 2011 and 2012.\nChicago Cubs.\nHe played in the Chicago Cubs organization in 2013.\nMinnesota Twins.\nHe signed a minor league deal with the Minnesota Twins in February 2014. He was released on July 19, 2014."

        "title": "Atlanta Junior Golf Association",
        "text": "The Atlanta Junior Golf Association is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Atlanta, Georgia. It was established in 1974 as the Dekalb Junior Golf Association with less than 100 members and conducted approximately one dozen events. Today it boasts over 1150 members annually and, for the first time in history, hosted 100 tournaments in 2007. Most of the tournaments take place from the end of May through the end of July, followed by four (4) season-ending championships and a Fall Tournament Series of 11 events. \nThe Atlanta Junior Golf Association was Mike Bentley's invention, who later moved onward and upward from the Atlanta Junior Golf Association to develop the American Junior Golf Association. It is run by three full-time staff members, one USGA P.J. Boatwright, Jr. Intern and one summer communications intern. It is governed by a board of directors made up of men and women from the Atlanta Area who are golf enthusiasts and junior golf supporters.\nMission.\nThe purpose of Atlanta Junior Golf is to provide an environment where a junior golfer, male or female ages 7–18, can enjoy golf and progress at his or her own rate from beginner to a proficient level while promoting and preserving the traditions and integrity of the game.\nMembership.\nMembership is open to junior golfers between the ages of 7 and 18 years who have not yet turned 19 and have not yet started college. All members must pay an annual, non-refundable membership fee which gives them access to all Atlanta Junior Golf tournaments and special events. \nMembership is divided into skill levels. Juniors may choose from Beginner, 9-Hole Club, 9-Hole Open, 18-Hole Club and 18-Hole Open Divisions. Within each of these divisions are separate age groups, thus ensuring each junior is always competing with other players of a similar age and ability. \nSeveral current members of the PGA, LPGA and NCAA golf programs are alums of Atlanta Junior Golf, including LPGA Tour player Angela Jerman, former University of Georgia standout and 2007 Ben Hogan Award winner Chris Kirk and former Auburn University golfer Margaret Shirley.\nSpecial events.\nAtlanta Junior Golf conducts several special events throughout the year, starting in January with 'College Day'. Atlanta area college coaches generously volunteer their Saturday morning to offer guidance to college hopefuls. Topics covered include golf resumes, NCAA Rules &amp; Regulations, time management, college recruiting, and other related issues. \nIn the spring, Atlanta Junior Golf conducts rules seminars which first and second year members must attend. The Georgia Junior Four-Ball is also conducted in the spring. \nThe summer tournament series culminates in four championships: the Beginner Open, Club Championship, 9-Hole Classic and Grand Championship. \nJuniors who participate in the 'Beginner Division' are invited to play in the year-end \"Beginner Open\". \nThe Club Championship is an invitational event for juniors who participated in 9-Hole or 18-Hole Club Divisions. 9-Hole players play in a one-day championship and 18-Hole players get the taste of two-day championship. \nThe 9-Hole Classic is a two-day championship for juniors from the 9-Hole Open Division. Each day consists of 9 holes with First, Second and Third place being awarded upon completion of the second day's round. This event is typically held at Ansley Golf Club in Atlanta. \nGrand Championship is another invitational tournament, hosted for qualifiers from the 18-Hole Open Division. The Grand Championship is a three-day, 54-hole tournament that has been held at many different golf courses from Sea Palms to Chateau Elan Callaway Gardens. Winning the Overall Girls Championship or the Overall Boys Championship is the highest award for an Atlanta Junior Golf Member. \nThe Fall Tournament Series is conducted over the fall months and was originally designed to offer juniors more local events in golf's general 'off season'. One-day and multi-day events are offered in this series. \nThe Atlanta-Kauai Team Challenge is a match play event between Atlanta Junior Golf and the Kauai Junior Golf Association from Kauai, Hawaii. This event pits 16 juniors from Atlanta against 16 juniors from Kauai and alternates between Atlanta and Kauai for the host location. This event usually ends up being as much, if not more, of a cultural exchange than a golf tournament.\nThe Georgia Cup is another match play event that is contested between the Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus and Savannah Junior Golf Associations. This event is played in the fall over a Saturday and Sunday and consists of 8 representatives from each association playing match play against each other. In 16 years, Atlanta Junior Golf has been Georgia Cup Champions 14 times.\nAwards.\nAtlanta Junior Golf hosts an Annual Awards Banquet at Druid Hills Golf Club every fall. Several awards are presented at this event including the following: \nPartners.\nAtlanta Junior Golf relies on corporate partnership to ensure costs to members are kept low. Atlanta Junior Golf thanks the following partners: \nPresenting Partner\nMajor Partners\nOn The Web.\nAtlanta Junior Golf Official Website \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/06/obituaries/p-j-boatwright-jr-authority-on-rules-for-golf-dies-at-63.html"

        "title": "2010 Women's Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup was the sixth edition of the Women's Rugby World Cup and was held in England. The International Rugby Board Executive Committee selected the host union following a recommendation from the Rugby World Cup Limited board after considering bids from the Rugby Football Union and the German Rugby Union – it had been England's third successive bid after being rejected in 2002 and 2006. The tournament was again being organised by the International Rugby Board (IRB) as opposed to the host union, and included five matches for all teams played on 20, 24, 28 August and 1 and 5 September. In May 2009 it was announced that the semi-final, 3rd place play off and final would take place at The Stoop and not Twickenham as had previously been suggested. Pool games were held at the Surrey Sports Park in Guildford.\nInterest in the tournament was far higher than had been anticipated. It was broadcast to 127 countries and all 2,500 seats at the opening two days of pool games were sold out, as was the third day despite the capacity being raised to 3,200. The semi-finals attracted over 6,000 spectators, while the final drew a crowd of 13,253 – a world record for a women's rugby international – and well as a worldwide TV audience of (according to IRB figures) half a million.\nThe competition was won by New Zealand who beat England 13–10 in the final.\nThree tries from the tournament were shortlisted for the IRB's \"Try of the Year\" award.\nBidding process.\nThe Rugby Football Union for Women and the Rugby Football Union along with Germany, South Africa and Kazakhstan made bids to host the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup. On 23 September, Rugby World Cup Limited Board chairman, Bernard Lapasset, announced that England would host the World Cup at various venues across West London.\nQualifying.\nNew Zealand, England and France qualified directly as the top three teams from the 2006 World Cup. Wales and Ireland qualified as second and third place finishers in the 2009 Six Nations Championship. Scotland and Sweden qualified as the top two teams from the 2009 European Trophy. The United States, Canada and South Africa qualified directly as the only teams from their region. Kazakhstan qualified after winning the 2009 ARFU Women's Championship. Australia qualified as the second Oceania representative.\nTickets and sponsorship.\nTickets had been available since 22 March 2010 and they could be purchased online at Ticketmaster or by phone, with an innovative ticketing structure based on some tournament passes and individual match day tickets.&lt;br&gt;\nThirteen matches were broadcast live through a platform provided by host broadcaster Sky Sports in 127 territories to a potential audience of 227 million homes, smashing the 2006 World Cup benchmark in Canada (75 territories and a potential reach of 97 million homes). The programming hours was increased from 60 in 2006 to 220 in this edition.&lt;br&gt;\nThe commercial partners of the tournament were Nike, Heineken, the Coca-Cola Company's sports drink Powerade, Holiday Inn, British rugby equipment supplier Rhino Rugby, University of Surrey and UK National Lottery.\nMatch officials.\nIn December 2009, the IRB announced a panel of 14 match officials for the tournament, including seven world's leading female referees and three specialist assistant referees with previous Women's Rugby World Cup experience.&lt;br&gt;\nEngland's Clare Daniels officiated the opening match between Canada and Scotland, while Australian Sarah Corrigan refereed the final between England and New Zealand.\nFormat.\nThe competition was contested over 16 days and 30 matches between 12 nations, divided into three pools of four teams. The tournament began on 20 August at Surrey Sports Park with a match between Canada and Scotland and ended with the final held at Twickenham Stoop on 5 September between England and New Zealand.\nPool stage.\nDefending champions New Zealand, hosts and 2006 runners-up England and 2006 bronze winners France all ranked top seeds in their pool. Teams played each other in each pool on a round robin basis, while match points were awarded according to the international standards: 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 point for scoring 4 or more tries or for losing by 7 or less than 7 points.&lt;br&gt;\nAt the end of the pool stage, the teams in a pool were ranked according to their cumulative match points. If two or more teams had been level, the following criteria would have been used in this order until one of the teams could be determined as the higher ranked:\nRanking finals.\nThe teams were seeded based on the position in which they finished in their respective pools and the points scored during the pool stage. The three pool winners and the best runner-up went through to the semi-finals. The other two runners-up and the best two 3rd-place finishers went into a sort of a competition for 5th place, whilst the bottom three teams competed for 9th place.&lt;br&gt;\nThe ranking finals were set as it follows:\nFinals.\nIf teams had been tied at full-time, the winner would have been determined through a 10-minutes extra time (the first team to score any points would have been declared the winner) or eventually a kicking competition (five players from each team would have kicked from three different points on the 22-metre line)."

The first two contain only normal teams, the third contains only ultra teams, and the fourth allows a player to create their own league from any mixture of normal and ultra teams. A player can either control a normal baseball team or an ultra baseball team with super hitting and pitching plays to boost their chances of winning.\nEach Ultra play uses a certain number of points. Ultra points are limited and when they are all used up no more ultra plays can be performed. There are also some Ultra Upgrades, for outfielders and batters. These cost more points to assign, but become intrinsic effects, and do not cost points to use.\nWithin \"Baseball Simulator 1.000\", there is an exhibition mode, a regular season mode, and a team edit mode that allows the player to make his own players to form a customized baseball team.\nA magic number appears during the regular season, telling the leading team how many victories they have to make until they are assured the pennant.\nA season can be 5, 30, 60, 120, or 165 games. Out of the 18 possible teams, only six teams can be used in a division/league during the season. However, there are no playoffs for the top two teams. Whoever wins the division is the champion.\n\"Baseball Simulator\" series.\nThese baseball titles included some form of \"Super League\" where pitchers and batters would have special abilities.\nReception.\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" awarded it \"Best Sports-Themed Video Game\" in their 1989 awards issue, giving it \"top honors ... [for] taking liberty with the sport itself\". \"1up.com\" listed it as one of the \"hidden gems\" of the NES, calling it one of the best baseball games for the system."

        "title": "List of worst Major League Baseball season win–loss records",
        "text": "Listed below are the Major League Baseball teams with the worst season won-lost records, as determined by win percentage (.300 or less), minimum 120 games played.\nSeason records.\nThe following teams finished the season with a .300 winning percentage or lower.\n1898 St. Louis Browns and 1899 Cleveland Spiders.\nThe 1899 Cleveland Spiders own the worst single-season record of all time (minimum 120 games) and for all eras, finishing at 20–134 (.130 percentage) in the final year of the National League's 12-team era in the 1890s; for comparison, this projects to 21–141 under the current 162-game schedule, and Pythagorean expectation based on the Spiders' results and the current 162-game schedule predicts a record of 24–138.\nThe Spiders had reasonable success in the 1890s, with seven straight winning seasons from 1892 to 1898 and a Temple Cup victory in 1895, while the once four-time American Association champion St. Louis Browns had fallen to 29–102 in 1897 (11–61 on the road) and to 39–111 (19–67 on the road) in 1898. The Spiders ownership, the Robison brothers, bought the Browns in time for the 1899 season, creating a conflict-of-interest situation which was later outlawed, and on the eve of the season, traded almost all of Cleveland's star players to St. Louis for very little in return, with respectable results for St. Louis and disastrous results for Cleveland.\nThe 1899 Spiders set the major league record for most consecutive losses in a season (24, from July 26 to September 16), and had six losing streaks of 10 games or more. The Spiders lost 40 of their last 41 games, finishing 84 games behind the 1899 National League champion Brooklyn Superbas and 35 games behind the second-last-placed Washington Senators. They also lost 27 games in September, a record for the most games lost in a month until the 1909 Washington Senators went 5–29 in July.\nDue to paltry attendances, the Spiders played 112 games on the road, finishing with a road record of 11–101 (the 101 road losses is a record which is unbreakable under the current MLB scheduling rules, which allow a maximum of 81 road games).\nThe 1899 Browns, renamed the \"Perfectos\" and staffed with all the best players from the 1898 Spiders (six of the Spiders' eight starting position players, and four starting pitchers, including the great Cy Young) improved by 44½ games, from 39–111 to 84–67. However, all St. Louis ultimately did was trade places with Cleveland in the standings. The Browns/Perfectos were renamed the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900, and are unrelated to the American League St. Louis Browns that adopted the discarded nickname and also appear on this list.\nAfter the 1899 season, the National League contracted from twelve to eight clubs for the 1900 season, with the Spiders, the original Baltimore Orioles, Louisville Colonels (Louisville has not had another major league team since), and the original Washington Senators folding operations. Baltimore had also been stripped of its best players by Brooklyn in 1899, to somewhat less dramatic effect, but still enough to speed their demise.\nThe downsized 1900 National League allowed the Western League to fulfill its dreams of becoming a major league, filling the void in a number of cities by renaming itself the American League in 1900, and declaring itself a major league in 1901.\nPre-1886 teams.\nWith shorter schedules before 1886, it was much more common for teams to finish with sub-.300 winning percentages, as there was less of the evening-out effect of a longer season, and some seasons had a number of teams, with nine in 1884 alone (between the three leagues that year).\nIn the list below (minimum 15 games played), four teams finished with worse overall winning percentages than the 1899 Spiders, but these teams played in leagues whose status as \"major\" is questionable: three of these occurred in the National Association (its status as a major league has long been disputed), and the other occurred in the Union Association (conventionally listed as a major league, but this status has been questioned due to the league's overall lack of playing talent and poor organizational structure).\nFurther to this, contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league, with the earliest record referencing the Union Association as a major league dating to 1922.\nOther teams 1886–present.\nThe 1889 Colonels finished 9–65 on the road, and their .122 road winning percentage is the third lowest in MLB history for a minimum of 60 games.\nThe 1890 Alleghenys were gutted before the season when nearly all of their best players defected to the Pittsburgh Burghers of the Players' League. Poor attendances meant that they played 97 of their 136 games on the road, finishing with a road record of 9–88: the 88 road losses remained a record until 1899, and is unreachable under current MLB scheduling rules, with the Alleghenys' .093 road winning percentage being the lowest in MLB history for a minimum of 60 games.\nThe Philadelphia Athletics were a dominant team in the early 1910s, winning American League pennants in 1913 and 1914 and the World Series in 1913. However, owner-manager Connie Mack felt that he was unable to pay his star players' salaries while the Federal League was in operation, and he sold or traded most of them after the 1914 World Series, in which the A's were upset by the Boston Braves in a 4-game sweep. The Athletics then finished in last place from 1915 to 1922. In 1916, they went 36–117, including 13–64 on the road. The 1916 Athletics' .235 winning percentage is the sixth-lowest of any MLB team and the lowest since 1900, along with their .170 road winning percentage.\nThe 1935 Boston Braves featured Hall of Famers Rabbit Maranville (age 43) and Babe Ruth (age 40). Braves owner Emil Fuchs had promised Ruth an ownership stake in the Braves and a chance to manage the club in the near future but had little intention of delivering either. Ruth retired on June 1, 1935, having hit .181 in 72 at-bats for the Braves, with six home runs (the last three all coming on the same day, May 25, 1935, at Pittsburgh). Fuchs, who had been plagued by financial problems for a decade, was forced to give up control of the Braves before the end of the season. The Braves' home winning percentage of .167 is the fifth-lowest of any MLB team and the lowest since 1900.\nThe 1962 New York Mets were an expansion team created to fill the void after the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers left New York City at the end of the 1957 season. The Mets, filled with castoffs like \"Marvelous\" Marv Throneberry as well as aging Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn and low-talent rookies such as Choo-Choo Coleman, finished 40–120, the third-worst winning percentage in the modern era (.250) and the modern-era record for most losses. The Mets went on to finish last or next-to-last for seven years in a row before they shocked the baseball world by winning the 1969 World Series.\nThe 2003 Detroit Tigers stood at 38–118 after 156 games, but won five of their last six games. On September 27, in their penultimate game, the Tigers came back from an 8–0 deficit to beat the Minnesota Twins 9–8. When the Tigers won the season finale to avoid tying the record, they received a standing ovation from the crowd. Mike Maroth, a starting pitcher for that Tigers team, went 9–21 and became the first pitcher to lose 20 games in a season since Brian Kingman dropped 20 games for the 1980 Oakland Athletics. Ramón Santiago became only the 12th Triple Crown loser (a player who finishes last in all of the three Triple Crown categories) in modern MLB history. One baseball statistician described the Tigers as possibly \"the worst team of all time without a good excuse\", as virtually every other team on the list had been effectively reduced to minor-league status, was plagued by financial problems, or was a first-year expansion team.\nThe 2018 Baltimore Orioles were the first team since the 2003 Tigers to win fewer than 50 games and finished 61 games behind the eventual AL East and World Series champion Boston Red Sox.\nAlthough the 2020 Pittsburgh Pirates had a 19–41 record, the fewest wins in a regular season since 1886, it is ignored because this took place in a pandemic-shortened season of sixty games, since the winning percentage was .317, higher than the .300 cutoff mentioned here."

        "text": "The National Tennis Center (), is a tennis center located in the Olympic Green. It opened on 1 October 2007. It hosted the tennis preliminaries and finals of singles and doubles for men and women at the Beijing 2008 Olympics as well as the Paralympic wheelchair tennis competitions. In 2009, it became the home of the China Open.\nGeneral information.\nThe center is located in Beijing, just from the Beijing National Stadium (a.k.a. The Birds Nest Stadium).\nThe tennis center covers an area of with a floor space of . \nThe center currently has 12 competition hard courts and 35 training courts, including 20 hard courts, 10 indoor hard courts, 2 artificial grass courts, 2 indoor clay courts, and a mini hard court.\nThe main court, named Diamond Court (nicknamed National Tennis Stadium), has a capacity of 15,000. The Lotus Court (10,000 capacity), Moon Court, and Brad Drewett Court all have 12 stands, which represent petals of lotus flowers, one of the emblems of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Lotus court has a capacity of 10,000. Moon Court has a capacity of 4,000 and Brad Drewett Court has a capacity of 2,000. The courts have been specially designed for natural air ventilation to reduce the amount of air pollution entering the courts, ensuring optimal health for both athletes and spectators. It also allows the courts to be cooled and with an installation of cooling machines, the courts' temperatures can easily be reduced to five degrees Celsius. Curtains attached to the roofs of the courts also allows them to be cooled in the heat of the sun.\nThe project embodies the concepts of Green Olympics, Hi-Tech Olympics, and People's Olympics. It integrates design experience of world sport architecture and will be a tennis competition venue of the state of the art design in keeping with international standards.\nIn 2009 the China Open, which is an ATP World Tour 500 series event and a WTA Premier Mandatory tournament, moved its location to this center from its former location, the Beijing Tennis Center.\nRename.\nThe National Tennis Center was named as The Olympic Green Tennis Center or Beijing Olympic Green Tennis Court (), at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. Since it started to host the China Open, the venue was renamed to National Tennis Center in 2009.\nTimeline.\nBefore The Olympics.\nAll courts except for the National Tennis Stadium were opened on 1 October 2007 and were tested between 6 and 20 October 2007 in the Good Luck Beijing 2007 ITF Pro Circuit, where 36 men and 44 women competed.\nDuring The Olympics.\nThe Courts hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The following competitions were played:\nDuring The Paralympics.\nThe Courts also hosted the wheelchair tennis competitions of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. These were played between 8 and 15 September 2008.\n112 athletes (approximately 64-80 male and 32~48 female) were classified into disability group.\nThe competitions played included:\nAfter The Olympics/Paralympics.\nAfter the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic games of 2008, the center remained standing. It did not host the 2008 China Open Tennis tournament, despite rumours it would. However, it became the new home of the China Open from 2009 onwards. A new center court, National Tennis Stadium, was completed in 2011. Featuring a retractable roof, this new court possesses a capacity of 15,000 spectators, making it the world's fifth largest tennis stadium by capacity. Lincuiqiao Station on Beijing Subway Line 8 opened in the same year, providing the closest public transport access to the tennis center."

        "title": "Fred Mitchell (baseball)",
        "text": "Frederick Francis Mitchell, born Frederick Francis Yapp (June 5, 1878 – October 13, 1970), was an American right-handed pitcher, catcher, first baseman and manager in Major League Baseball. Mitchell was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts as Frederick Francis Yapp, although he went by Mitchell (which he would legally change his name to in 1943).\nPlaying career.\nHe pitched for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Athletics, Philadelphia Phillies, and Brooklyn Superbas from to before returning to the major leagues as a catcher for the New York Highlanders in . Mitchell appeared in 97 games over the course of twelve years as a pitcher that sometimes dabbled in the infield. He batted .210 in 201 games while catching 62 games in 1910. He was one of the few players to have played for both Boston franchises along with the Yankees. He was noted for relieving Hall of Famer Cy Young in the first-ever Red Sox game. He stopped playing after the 1913 season, although he dabbled in assisting with the pitching for the team for the following year, essentially serving as an early example of a pitching coach.\nManagerial career.\nThe Cubs desired Mitchell despite him being under contract to the Braves. They traded Joe Kelly and cash for the rights to Mitchell. On December 14, 1916, he was signed by the Cubs by owner Charles Weeghman. Mitchell was the fifth manager to have been hired after Frank Chance had departed the team after the 1912 season, with Mitchell being the only one to serve longer than one season. He took a team that won 67 games and lead them to 74 in . The following season was reduced in games due to US involvement in World War I that meant for a September postseason and 131 games for a season. Mitchell was named team president prior to the season. The Cubs would go 84–45 (with two ties) while finishing first in the National League despite having their star pitcher in Grover Cleveland Alexander leave the team to serve in the war. In the World Series that year, they faced the Boston Red Sox (including Hall of Famers in Harry Hooper and Babe Ruth) in a series that was one of the lowest-scoring in history. The Cubs out-hit and out-scored the Red Sox narrowly (ten to nine), but the Cubs could not recover from losing three of the first four games, with Cubs ace Hippo Vaughn losing twice. The Series was later plagued with allegations of a Series fix circled around two Cubs pitchers (Phil Douglas and Claude Hendrix), although nothing was proven definitively.\nAfter the season, he hired sportswriter William Veeck Sr, who became his successor as president. Mitchell's two subsequent seasons resulted in the same number of wins while other National League teams passed them by, and he was let go after finishing fifth (18 games behind) in 1920.\nMitchell was hired for the 1921 season in Boston for the Braves. He rebounded them to a 79–74 record (a seventeen-game improvement), good for a fourth-place finish. It proved to be the best mark of his tenure with the Braves, who would plummet to losing 100 games in the next two seasons before Mitchell was fired (the Braves would proceed to have an era of .500 or less seasons until 1933). He retired with a record of 494–543–7 record.\nAfter he was fired by the Braves, he returned to Harvard University. Mitchell coached the Crimson for twelve seasons over three tenures (1916, 1926, 1929–1938), with his record being 216–134. Harvard joined the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League for the 1933 season, and he would lead them to their first ever regular season title with a 8–4 record in 1936 that tied for first with Dartmouth. He remained at Harvard for thirty years until his retirement. Mitchell was best known for his excellence in coaching.\nDeath.\nMitchell died in Newton, Massachusetts at age 92. He is buried in Brookside Cemetery in Stow, Massachusetts."

        "text": "Emil Edwin Fuchs (April 17, 1878 – December 5, 1961) was a German-born American baseball owner and executive.\nLife.\nFuchs was born in Hamburg, Germany to Jewish parents, Hermann and Henrietta, but grew up on the Lower East Side of New York. He received his LLB degree from New York University, and began practicing law in 1899. He was married to Oretta, and the couple had two sons (Job and Robert) and one daughter (Helen A. Meltzer). From 1902 to 1910 Fuchs was Deputy Attorney General for New York.\nCareer in baseball.\nFuchs was the attorney for John McGraw's New York Giants when he bought the Boston Braves with Christy Mathewson and James McDonough in 1922. Mathewson was originally intended to be the principal owner. However, Mathewson's precarious health (he'd suffered a severe case of tuberculosis shortly after World War I and never recovered) forced him to turn over the team presidency to Fuchs after the 1923 season. After Jack Slattery quit as manager, Fuchs hired Rogers Hornsby to manage the rest of the 1928 season. However, Fuchs was already in financial trouble, and was forced to sell Hornsby to the Chicago Cubs after the season. He then took over as his own manager, finishing in last place. The Philadelphia Phillies loaned Fuchs $35,000 to keep the Braves solvent.\nBy 1935, he was in such dire straits that he could not afford the rent on Braves Field. When he learned that Babe Ruth's days as a New York Yankee were numbered, Fuchs bought the slugger from Jacob Ruppert. The move returned the Babe to the city where he had begun his major league career; he'd played for the Red Sox from 1914 to 1919. Ruth was named vice-president and assistant manager of the Braves, and promised a share of team profits. Fuchs also hinted that Ruth, who made no secret of his managerial ambitions, could become manager as early as 1936. Ruth soon realized that his titles were almost meaningless, and that Fuchs was merely using him in a last-ditch effort to revive his fortunes. Seeing a team in disarray, Ruth announced his retirement on June 1. Fuchs was forced to sell the team to minority partner Charles Adams on July 31, 1935. After selling the Braves, he resumed his law career. He died in Boston, Massachusetts.\nLegacy.\nThe Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America annually awards the Judge Emil Fuchs Memorial Award for Long and Meritorious Service to baseball."

        "title": "Rules of golf",
        "text": "The rules of golf consist of a standard set of regulations and procedures by which the sport of golf should be played. They are jointly written and administered by The R&amp;A (spun off from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 2004) and the United States Golf Association (USGA). The R&amp;A is the governing body of golf worldwide except in the United States and Mexico, which are the responsibility of the USGA. The rule book, entitled \"Rules of Golf\", is updated and published on a regular basis and also includes rules governing amateur status.\nThe rules of golf cover all aspects of play, including definitions of terminology, procedures and equipment parameters. It also prescribes specific penalties that may be enacted in certain situations and for rule infractions. A central principle, although not one of the numbered rules, is found in the R&amp;A rule book's inside front cover: \"Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what is fair. But to do what is fair, you need to know the Rules of Golf.\"\nIn addition to the rules, golf adheres to a code of conduct known as etiquette, which generally means playing the game with due respect for the golf course and other players. Etiquette is often seen as being as important to the sport as the rules themselves.\nHistory.\nBefore the rules of golf were standardised golf clubs commonly had their own set of rules, which while broadly the same had subtle differences, such as allowing for the removal of loose impediments, e.g. leaves and small stones. In the late 19th century, most clubs began to align themselves with either the Society of St. Andrews Golfers, later the R&amp;A, or the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith, later the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers.\nThe earliest surviving written rules of golf were produced by the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith on March 7, 1744, for a tournament played on April 2. They were entitled \"Articles and Laws in Playing at Golf\" and consisted of 13 rules. The original manuscript of the rules is in the collection of the National Library of Scotland:\nDebate surrounds the authorship of these regulations, which were signed by John Rattray and which—on matters of order of play, outside interference, water hazards, holing out, making a stroke, and the stroke and distance penalty for the loss of a ball—remain an integral part of the modern game. Rattray's sole signature does not guarantee that he was wholly responsible for them, though his prominence within the company and Edinburgh society at large makes him the most likely candidate. Under these rules he went on to win the silver club for a second time in April 1745.\n\"Rules of Golf\" (book).\nThe \"Rules of Golf\" and the \"Rules of Amateur Status\" are published every four years by the governing bodies of golf (R&amp;A/USGA) to define how the game is to be played. The \"Rules\" have been published jointly in this manner since 1952, although the code was not completely uniform until 2000 (with mostly minor revisions to Appendix I). Before 2012 the USGA and R&amp;A presented the same content differently in separate editions. The same content is now published in a uniform fashion with similar formatting and covers — the only differences are now some spelling and their logos. The Rules Committee of The R&amp;A, which was spun off from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 2004, has responsibility for upkeep and application of the rules worldwide except in the United States and Mexico, which are the responsibility of the United States Golf Association (USGA).\nThe term \"Rules\" can be said to include the following: \nThrough the course of 2020, the USGA and R&amp;A devised World Handicap System came into effect, replacing the many different handicapping systems in use around the world. While the USGA directly administers the course rating system in its territories, the R&amp;A defers this responsibility to the various national governing bodies.\nEtiquette.\nThe \"Rules of Golf\" book includes a section on proper etiquette, defining recommendations that make the game safe, enjoyable and fair for all players. While none of these guidelines are enforced by penalty in and of themselves, the course authorities or other local \"committee\" may, under Rule 33-7, disqualify any player who acts in serious breach of etiquette, thereby violating the \"spirit of the game\". Such serious breaches include actions made with intent to damage the course, facilities or other players' equipment, to injure other players or disturb/distract them while making their play, to unreasonably hold up or delay other players from continuing their game, or to use any of the Rules or Decisions for the purpose of gaining an unfair advantage over any other player.\nDefinitions.\nThe rulebook also include definitions of terms used throughout the rule-book (sometimes including examples of what does or does not meet a definition), and defines the use of particular words in context to clarify what is meant by the use of a word. The rules, for instance, differentiate between use of \"a\" and \"the\" referring to objects involved in play (\"a ball\" refers to any ball that can be used in a situation; \"the ball\" specifically refers to the ball previously mentioned in the Rule), or between \"may\" (discretionary), \"should\" (non-binding recommendation) and \"must\" (binding requirement). Where used in the Rules, the definitions of the terms are binding and must be strictly observed; players must not use a differing definition in order to include or exclude an object involved in play from a particular Rule governing the object.\nDecisions.\nIn addition to the Rules and Etiquette, a number of interpretations of the Rules have been published by the USGA/R&amp;A that prescribe the proper procedure in certain situations where the Rules themselves may not be clear. The Decisions are numbered based on the Rule or sub-rule being interpreted and the order in which Decisions were published. When a player has a question, they may ask a rules official who has an actual \"Decisions Book\".\nDecisions may be simple clarifications, define the proper procedure in exceptional or unforeseen cases, or rule that specific actions, equipment or fixtures used by a player or implemented by the committee are legal or illegal. These decisions are binding in situations where they apply, as they define the proper implementation of the Rules themselves. They are not included in most rulebooks, but like the Rules they are available for reference on the USGA website.\nNotable rule changes.\nThe biggest change that came with the 2008–2011 edition was a new rule about clubheads not having too much 'spring' effect. This has led to the publishing of lists of conforming and non-conforming drivers.\nIn 2010 a new rule governing grooves came into force for professional and high-level amateur competition. The change was made in order to decrease the amount of back spin that players were able to produce, particularly from the rough. However, due to a previous legal settlement with Ping following an earlier rule change in the early 1990s, their \"Eye 2\" irons, which were otherwise non-conforming, were deemed legal. This led to a controversy in the early stages of the 2010 PGA Tour season when Phil Mickelson used these irons. While Mickelson's use of the irons was ruled legal, Ping decided to surrender its remaining rights under the now-20-year-old legal settlement, and the original Ping Eye 2 sets are now officially non-conforming. Ping continues to produce a set of wedges with this name and general shape, but these new Ping Eye 2 wedges have conforming face and groove designs.\nThe 2012–2015 edition was published October 24, 2011. Nine rules were changed, the most significant being Ball Moving After Address (Rule 18-2b). Rory McIlroy was penalized by this Rule in the final round of the 2011 Open Championship.\nThe 2016 edition added Rule 14-1b, which forbids players from anchoring a club against their body in any way (such as directly against the body or by using their forearm to create an anchor point back to their body). While the rule change is expected to prominently affect the users of long putters, the two governing bodies stated that \"the proposed rule narrowly targets only a few types of strokes, while preserving a golfer's ability to play a wide variety of strokes in his or her individual style.\"\nOn April 25, 2017, Decision 34-3/10 was issued, which limits the usage of video footage as evidence of certain infractions if the infraction \"can't be seen with the naked eye\", or the player had done \"all that can be reasonably expected to make an accurate estimation or measurement\" in order to correctly play or spot their ball, even if video evidence suggests otherwise. Although the sanctioning bodies stated that this was part of an effort to update and modernize the Rules, media outlets considered the ruling to be a response to an incident from the 2017 ANA Inspiration tournament, where Lexi Thompson was retroactively penalized four strokes from her third round score for mis-placing a ball, as reported by a television viewer, going as far as nicknaming it the \"Lexi Thompson rule\".\nFollowing a lengthy consultation process, the Rules of Golf were completely rewritten and updated with many significant changes, including to some basic terminology. Notable changes included dropping from knee height (previously shoulder), putting out on the green with the flagstick left in (previously incurred a penalty), a defined relief area, reduced search time (3 minutes instead of the previous 5) and ability to repair spike/shoe damage on the green. The new rules came into effect on January 1, 2019."

He served as the head football coach at North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts—now known as North Carolina State University from 1899 to 1900 and Georgia Tech in 1901, compiling a career coaching record of 5–7–3.\nMcKee was born and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, the son of Dr. James McKee and Mildred Sasser McKee. He received his secondary education at the Raleigh Male Academy. McKee enrolled at the University of North Carolina and played on the North Carolina Tar Heels football team from 1897 to 1898 as tackle. While at the school, he was also a member of the Zeta Psi Fraternity.\nAfter graduation, McKee coached at North Carolina A&amp;M from 1899 to 1900, leading his teams to record of 1–7–2 two seasons. In 1901, he coached at Georgia Tech, guiding the 1901 Georgia Tech football team to a record of 4–0–1. After Georgia Tech's season ended, McKee joined the staff of the 1901 Georgia Bulldogs football team in their preparation against Auburn. McKee sued the Georgia Tech in June 1902 for breach of contract for the amount of $500.\nFollowing his football coaching career, he received a medical degree from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1907, and entered into medical practice in his hometown of Raleigh. During World War I, McKee achieved the rank of major in the American Expeditionary Forces as a field surgeon with the 1st Gas Regiment. McKee returned to Raleigh after the war where he was the city physician until 1948. “Dr. John” was very well known throughout the state of North Carolina for his gruff but compassionate sense of humor and his propensity to curse. He loved to drive a T-Model Ford automobile. When Ford discontinued the car, McKee refused to drive any longer despite the fact he was issued a new Buick every year by the Raleigh city fathers, and police officers and firemen took him on his rounds every morning. McKee died in Morganton, North Carolina on April 22, 1950, at the home of his son, Dr. John S. McKee, Jr., superintendent of the Broughton State Mental Hospital."

He is currently the defence coach for the New South Wales Waratahs and the Australian national team.\nEarly years.\nAs a boy, Grey lived in Papua New Guinea and Fiji for three years. He moved to Queensland and started at The Southport School in 1987.\nCareer.\nAfter he left school Grey joined the Queensland Reds extended training squad. In 1997 he played two games for Queensland against France, at Ballymore Stadium. At the end of 1997, after being invited on a NSW development tour of the UK, he was offered a full contract with the New South Wales Waratahs.\nHe made his Waratahs debut in March 1998, against the ACT Brumbies, at Sydney Football Stadium. Between 1998 and 2005, Grey played 94 Super games for the Waratahs, 92 at centre, one at flyhalf, and one as a flanker. (For the Wallabies, he was also named to play at least one Test at flyhalf.)\nIn 1998, Grey played his first Test for Australia, when he came off the bench against Scotland to score a try.\nIn 2001 Grey was involved in controversy after a cynical high tackle on Richard Hill during a Lions test match.\nIn 2005, Grey made a strong statement against racist slurs of the kind attributed to him during a Test against South Africa. According to a UK newspaper, Grey said: \"I am personally offended by the reports because I consider remarks of the type I am alleged to have made to be appalling in every respect.\"\nGray went on to play 35 Tests for Australia. He was a member of the victorious Wallabies at the 1999 Rugby World Cup, coached by Rod Macqueen. In 89th minute of the final, Grey left the bench to relieve inside centre Tim Horan. He was a member of Australia's 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, and trained with fellow centre Stirling Mortlock.\nAfter leaving the Waratahs, Grey spent five years in Japan.

As player-coach he helped Kyuden achieve promotion to the Top League for the 2007-8 season.\nIn April 2010, Grey became the Melbourne Rebels first defence (or skills) Coach. The 2011 Super Rugby season was the Rebels first in Super Rugby. Gray had been recruited by Rebels founding coach Rod Macqueen. Stirling Mortlock became captain. After the 2011 season Macqueen handed over to Damien Hill who promoted Grey to Assistant Coach in preparation for 2012.\nHowever, in 2013, Grey was recruited by newly appointed Waratahs head coach Michael Cheika for the 2013 Super Rugby season. He had a massive influence on the team in his debut season, improving the Waratahs defence to secure 9th in the standings with a better points for than against. In 2014, he helped guide the Waratahs to their first ever Super Rugby title, which included the Waratahs having a home grand final as they finished top of the standings after the regular season. In February 2015, he was appointed as defence coach for the Australian national side for the 2015 Rugby World Cup by newly appointed head coach Michael Cheika.\nDuring the 2015 Super Rugby season, Grey's defensive structures were challenged, with the Waratahs leaking 41 tries, almost double the amount of the 2013 Season, 24. He was heavily criticised after the 35–17 loss to the Highlanders in the semi-final in Sydney, having conceded 20 points in the second half of the match to see the Waratahs knocked out of the tournament.\nEducation.\nGrey has a bachelor's degree in Business Management and a master's in Marketing."

        "text": "Scott Maurice Robertson (born 21 August 1974) is a New Zealand rugby union coach and former player. He is the current head coach of the All Blacks, the men's New Zealand national team.\nDuring his time as Crusaders coach, not only did he win all seven finals since he took the reins, he has a record of 98 wins, just 17 losses and 2 draws out of 117 games, making him the most successful Super Rugby coach since the competition began.\nNickname \"Razor\", he played as a flanker for Bay of Plenty, Perpignan, Canterbury and the Crusaders. He won 23 international caps for New Zealand between 1998 and 2002.\nHe was the head coach of the New Zealand U20 team, the Canterbury ITM Cup team, and the Crusaders in Super Rugby. With the Crusaders, he won seven consecutive Super Rugby championships, from 2017 to 2023.\nPlaying career.\nRobertson grew up in Tauranga and attended Mount Maunganui College. He played for Bay of Plenty. In 1996 he moved to Canterbury to play for the Crusaders in the first year of the Super 12 competition. He played as a flanker.\nAfter leaving the Crusaders, Robertson moved to Europe, where he played for a number of clubs, including Ards (Northern Ireland), Ayr (Scotland) and Perpignan (France). He eventually moved to Japan where he played for the Ricoh Black Rams, before retiring in 2007.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring from playing, Robertson became the head coach at Sumner Rugby Club in Christchurch, New Zealand. In 2004 he was active in establishing an under-19 team at Sumner.\nAfter working as the assistant coach of Canterbury for five years under head coaches Rob Penney (2008–2011) and Tabai Matson (2012), Robertson was appointed Canterbury's head coach in 2013, when they won the Final in the Premiership Division of the ITM Cup. Under his guidance, Canterbury won the competition again in 2015. Robertson was also appointed as head coach of the Brazil national rugby union team for the 2012 and 2013 seasons, as part of a partnership between the Brazilian Rugby Union and the Crusaders.\nIn 2014, the New Zealand Rugby Union appointed Robertson head coach of the New Zealand Under-20 team, which subsequently won the 2015 World Rugby Under 20 Championship in Italy.\nRobertson coached the New Zealand Under-20s in the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship in Manchester, where they failed to make the play-offs.\nIn June 2016, Robertson was appointed head coach for the Crusaders for the 2017-2019 Super Rugby seasons. During the 2017 season Robertson captured a Super Rugby title with a 25–17 victory over the Lions, becoming only the second first-year coach to win a championship after Dave Rennie in 2012 with conference rivals the Chiefs. On 4 August 2018 he achieved a second straight Super Rugby title with his Crusaders team again defeating the Lions 37–18, again following in the footsteps of Rennie being the second rookie coach to win 2 titles in 2 seasons.\nIn winning the Crusaders' third successive title, Robertson became the first \"rookie\" Super Rugby coach to win 3 successive titles in their first three seasons as a head coach. The last time a team won three titles in a row was the Crusaders as well between 1998 &amp; 2000, where Wayne Smith led them to two championships before taking up a role with the All Blacks, Robbie Deans would then claim the third title in 2000 beginning one of the most successful periods in the franchise's history.\nIn 2020, and 2021 Robertson coached the Crusaders to two successful Super Rugby Aotearoa championships. These were both considered a soft-competition on the Super Level due to the pandemic and only playing 5 New Zealand teams, with many of the teams suffering key player losses early on. Since becoming head coach of the Crusaders, the only competition he hasn't won was the 2021 Super Rugby Trans-Tasman add-on, and despite earning 5 wins from 5 games, the Crusaders only ranked third (based on points difference), and missed the final.\nFollowing on from the successful Super Rugby Aotearoa campaigns, Robertson again coached the Crusaders to a championship, this time in the maiden Super Rugby Pacific Format in 2022.\nOn 24 June 2023 he coached the Crusaders to a 7th consecutive title with a 20–25 win over the Chiefs, in Hamilton.\nRobertson is known for his post victory match break dancing routine \nIn March 2023, it was announced that he would take over from Ian Foster as head coach of New Zealand from the start of 2024. Though his first All Blacks fixtures as head coach will not occur until 2024, his time as head coach began on 1 November 2023, after the conclusion of the 2023 Rugby World Cup tournament.\nMedia work.\nRobertson was a guest commentator for the 2017 British &amp; Irish Lions tour series."

        "text": "The Philadelphia International Championship was an annual bicycle race held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was described as \"America's top international cycling classic, and one of the richest and most prestigious one day races outside of Europe.\" It was one of the longest single-day races in the U.S. at . The men's event was ranked 1.1 by the International Cycling Union (UCI), the sport's governing body, which made it the highest ranked single-day race in the Western Hemisphere after the UCI World Tour Grand Prix Cycliste de Montreal and Grand Prix Cycliste de Quebec. It was part of the UCI America Tour.\nThe race had existed since 1985, but its name changed a number of times, because of the changing of names of its corporate sponsors, due to bank mergers and acquisitions. The title sponsor was originally CoreStates Bank, followed by First Union Bank in 1998, then Wachovia Bank in 2002. In November 2005, Wachovia withdrew its sponsorship. With assistance from former Philadelphia mayor and then-Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, a corporate sponsor was found in 2006; Commerce Bank made a four-year commitment. Due to its acquisition by Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2007, Commerce Bank became TD Bank in 2008.\nThe Philadelphia International Championship was once the final leg of a one-week, 3-race circuit called the TD Bank Triple Crown of Cycling. The races took place in Lancaster, Reading and Philadelphia. The opening race was the Lancaster Classic, followed four days later by the Reading Classic, with the finale in Philadelphia three days after that.\nThrough 2005, the highest placed finisher registered in the United States was named the USPRO champion, whether or not he won the race. The race was often called the USPRO Championship; however, USA Cycling, the national governing body, stripped the Philadelphia race of the USPRO title, wanting to limit the race to Americans. Local organizers insisted the field remain open to the pros from all around the world.\nThere was a men's and a women's race, the latter called the \"Liberty Classic\". The seven-lap men's race consisted of a three-lap opening circuit, followed by seven laps of the primary circuit, then a five-lap 4.8 km closing circuit. The total distance was . The women's race was on the same course but started later and was shorter: 4 laps of the primary circuit for .\nThe race started on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and then headed along Kelly Drive into the northwest section of the city, through East Falls, Manayunk, and Roxborough, then returned to the Parkway and Logan Circle to complete its loop, passing parts of Fairmount Park along the way.\nTop cyclists who have participated include Eric Heiden, who won the race in 1985, Greg LeMond, and Lance Armstrong, who started his professional career when he won the race in 1993.\nThe cancellation of the 2017 races was announced by the UCI at the end of January 2017, citing difficulty in obtaining sponsorship resulting in financial difficulties for the organisers.\nManayunk Wall.\nIn bicycling terminology, a \"wall\" is a steep incline. The Manayunk Wall, located by Jerry Casale and David Chauner when they were laying out the course in 1985, refers to Levering Street and Lyceum Avenue in northwest Philadelphia. It begins at Main Street and Levering Street in the neighborhood of Manayunk, proceeds on the well-worn cobblestone Cresson Street under the elevated railway, then back on to Levering Street.\nMost of the Wall is part of Levering Street, but it becomes Lyceum Avenue at Tower Street. The steepest section, a 17-percent grade, commences just after the slight left turn when going up at the intersection with Tower Street, and ends at the intersection with Fleming street. It becomes less steep on the stretch with O'Brien's as it crosses Manayunk Avenue. It nearly flattens and ends at Pechin Street in Roxborough, which most news crews set up for broadcasting. The right turn off Lyceum Avenue onto Pechin Street begins The Fall from the Wall. Manayunk Avenue is the boundary of Manayunk and Roxborough.\nO'Brien's Water Hole along the wall sets up a water sprinkler for cyclists to ride through. In early years, no one seemed to mind but as the race became more important, it was criticized as a distraction and reduced.\nOn June 5, 2002, Manayunk designated the 17-percent grade as the Manayunk Wall. Olympic gold medalist Marty Nothstein presented a plaque.\nDownhill Race.\nAt midnight, the morning of the international championship, an unlicensed race down The Wall took place from 1996-2006. \"The Downhill\" was conceived at Dawson Street Pub. Racers gathered there to walk to The Wall. The race started at Manayunk Avenue and Lyceum Avenue and continued to the bottom of the hill or until where police blocked the street. The race included BMX bikes, tricycles, shopping carts, wheelchairs, skateboards, bed frames and roller skates. The event grew in popularity after being promoted on a radio station in 2003 and several thousand spectators attended in 2006. A young man was injured during the 2006 race when he was blindsided by another individual who was careening down the wall in a shopping cart. Police are generally credited as permanently stopping the race.\nOn September 6, 2008 the Red Bull Soapbox Race was held at the Manayunk Wall."

Though perhaps best known for his interests in Thoroughbreds, his interests were diversified and he became a bulwark of the Ontario Hockey Association in its struggling years. When John Ross Robertson became the Ontario Hockey Association president in its 10th year of existence, he realized that he needed strong men around him to make the organization a success so he called upon Nelson, sports editor of the \"Toronto Globe\", for assistance. Nelson served as OHA vice president from 1903 to 1905. The following season he was named OHA governor to the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada and was later elected a life member. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947.\nNelson was born in Hamilton, Canada West, in 1859 and died on a steamer on the Panama Canal in April 1932 of a heart attack.\nIn 1933, Canadian Olympic Committee member W.

        "text": "The IIHF World Junior Championship (WJC), sometimes referred to as World Juniors, is an annual event organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for national under-20 ice hockey teams from around the world. It is traditionally held in late December, ending in early January (beginning from Boxing Day to January 5). The tournament usually attracts the top hockey players in this age category. \nThe main tournament features the top ten ranked hockey nations in the world, comprising the 'Top Division', from which a world champion is crowned. There are also three lower pools—Divisions I, II and III—that each play separate tournaments playing for the right to be promoted to a higher pool, or face relegation to a lower pool.\nThe competition's profile is particularly high in Canada, and this is partly for historical reasons in that prior to NHL players being allowed in the Winter Olympics, this was a rare tournament where the best western players faced the best players from the Soviet bloc, and the only other tournament of similar stature where this occurred was the irregularly scheduled Canada Cup invitational tournament. The tournament's stature in Canada can also be credited to Canada's strong performance in the tournament (it has won the gold medal twenty times since its inception), the role of hockey in Canadian culture, along with strong media coverage and fan attendance. As such, in recent years, nearly half of the tournaments have been held in Canadian cities, with the remainder being held in Europe and the United States.\nUnited States is the defending champion of the tournament, after defeating Sweden to win the 2024 edition in Gothenburg, Sweden.\nHistory.\nThe first official tournament was held in 1977, although the first three tournaments were held unofficially from 1974 to 1976. The tournament has been dominated by the teams from Canada and Soviet Union/CIS/Russia, together accounting for 33 of the 48 overall gold medals awarded (through 2024). The USSR won the first four official tournaments, while the Canadians put together five straight championships between 1993 and 1997, and another five straight from 2005 to 2009. Canada leads the all-time gold medal count with 20 golds, while the Soviet Union, the CIS, and Russia combined have 13 golds.\nWhen it began, the World Junior Championship was a relatively obscure tournament. It has since grown in prestige, particularly in Canada, where the tournament ranks as one of the most important events on the sports calendar and during the holiday season. \"The Globe and Mail\" writer Bruce Dowbiggin credits TSN, along with Canada's strong performance at the tournament, for turning it from an obscure non-event when it acquired the rights in 1991 (which had started to grow in prominence due to the 1987 Punch-up in Piestany) to one of Canada's most beloved annual sports events, and at the same time cementing the link between Canadian nationalism and hockey, and inspiring the NHL's Winter Classic. Based on increasing attendances for countries repeatedly hosting the event, the popularity of the tournament seems to be growing in other nations as well.\nAt editions of the tournament held in the country, games involving Team Canada consistently sell out NHL arenas, offering large profit guarantees to Hockey Canada and the IIHF. In the 21st century, Canada has and will continue to host the tournament every second or third year due to the significantly greater following the tournament has in Canada compared to other participating countries.\nOriginally, Switzerland was selected to host the WJHC in 2010, but withdrew.\nBuffalo, New York, in the United States, hosted the tournament in 2011 and 2018; in both cases, proximity to Canada's population core in Southern Ontario was a key factor in the city winning the bidding rights.\nThe tournament offers one of the most prestigious stages for young hockey players, significantly boosting a player's value for upcoming NHL Entry Drafts.\nPunch-up in Piestany.\nOne of the most infamous incidents in WJC history occurred in 1987 in Piestany, Czechoslovakia (now part of Slovakia), where a bench-clearing brawl occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union. It began when the Soviet Union's Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Canadian player Theoren Fleury. The Soviet Union's Evgeny Davydov then came off the bench, eventually leading to both benches emptying. The officials, unable to break up the numerous fights, left the ice and eventually tried shutting off the arena lights, but the brawl lasted for 20 minutes before the IIHF declared the game null and void. A 35-minute emergency meeting was held, resulting in the delegates voting 7–1 (the sole dissenter was Canadian Dennis McDonald) to eject both teams from the tournament. The Canadian team chose to leave rather than stay for the end-of-tournament dinner, from which the Soviet team was banned.\nWhile the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal and was leading 4–2 at the time of the brawl. The gold medal ultimately went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had previously been eliminated from medal contention, was awarded the bronze.\nFuture tournaments.\nThese tournaments have been announced:\nThe IIHF announced that Canada will host the tournament every other year until their agreement with Hockey Canada runs out in 2034.\nParticipating countries.\nCanada, Finland, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia/Czechia have participated in all 44 IIHF Ice Hockey World Junior Championships as well as the three unofficial tournaments. The United States has participated in all except the unofficial tournament in 1976. USSR/CIS/Russia participated in all tournaments until the 2023 edition (having been suspended by the IIHF in February 2022).\nWhen Czechoslovakia peacefully split in 1993, Czechia remained in Pool A but Slovakia was placed in Pool C (now Division II). Slovakia was promoted to the top division for the 1996 Championships and has remained there since.\nWhen the Soviet Union broke up, Russia remained in Pool A, while all other former Soviet republics started competing in Pool C in 1993.\nStarting with the 1996 tournament, the competition was increased from an 8-team round-robin to the current 10-team format, including elimination rounds. Since then, Switzerland has become a regular participant.\nGermany has been a frequent participant in the top pool, having played there roughly half the time in the past decade. Latvia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan have also each made a number of top division appearances since the early 1990s. Less frequent top pool appearances have been made by Austria, Denmark, France, Japan, Norway, Poland and Ukraine.\nAt the most recent championship, held in Sweden in 2024, participating teams included Canada, Czechia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Norway, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.\nPlayer eligibility.\nA player is eligible to play in the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships if:\nIf a player who has never played in IIHF-organized competition wishes to switch national eligibility, he must have played in competitions for two consecutive years in the new country without playing in another country, as well as show his move to the new country's national association with an international transfer card. In case the player has previously played in IIHF-organized competition but wishes to switch national eligibility, he must have played in competitions for four consecutive years in the new country without playing in another country, he must show his move to the new country's national association with an international transfer card, as well as be a citizen of the new country. A player may only switch national eligibility once.\nTournament awards.\nAt the conclusion of each tournament, the Directorate of the IIHF presents awards to the Top Goalie, Forward, and Defenceman of the tournament. The media attending the event select an All-Star team separately from this.\nBroadcast coverage.\nThe following television networks and websites broadcast World Junior Championship games on television or online.\nTSN is the IIHF's main broadcast partner for this tournament. TSN.ca carries all games excluding relegation games live, as well as most games on demand after their completion. Beginning with 2022 WJC, the international feed produced by TSN as seen on NHL Network's USA Hockey team games has the IIHF lettering for game scores instead of TSN's.\nStarting with the 2013 tournament, a paywall and geo-block was implemented on TSN's online coverage. The same system applies to Canadian cable subscribers and subscribers of TSN's streaming service - users cannot stream the tournament outside of Canada on TSN Direct.\nNorway is currently a 'blackout' zone. Neither Eurosport or Viasat carry the tournament."

        "title": "2006 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 90th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 28, 2006. Sam Hornish Jr. won from the pole position. It was Hornish's first and only win at Indianapolis, and the record fourteenth Indy victory for Penske Racing. Hornish would later win the IndyCar Series championship, the second driver in a row to sweep the Indy 500 and season championship in the same season.\nIn one of the most dramatic finishes in Indy history, 19-year old rookie Marco Andretti took the lead with three laps to go, after passing his father Michael Andretti on the outside of turn one. Marco Andretti battled Sam Hornish Jr. over the final two laps, holding off the challenge until the final straightaway. On the final lap, Hornish passed Marco Andretti about 450 feet from the finish line to take the win. It was the first time a driver successfully made a pass for the lead on the final lap for victory in the 90-year history of the event.\nThe margin of victory was 0.0635 seconds - just over one car-length - which was the second-closest finish in Indy history at the time. (As of 2019, it is the third-closest). Hornish had earned the pole in qualifying with a four-lap average of , and second place Marco Andretti was unanimously voted the Rookie of the Year. Defending race winner and defending IndyCar champion Dan Wheldon dominated much of the race, leading 148 of the 200 laps. However, a small tire puncture forced him to make his final pit stop earlier than planned, which coupled with an untimely caution period, saw him slip to fourth at the finish.\nThe race was sanctioned by the Indy Racing League and was part of the 2006 IndyCar Series season. With a high temperature of , it was one of the hottest days on record for the running of the Indy 500. Rain and cold temperatures washed out the first weekend of time trials, and washed out or delayed numerous days of practice. Race weekend, however, was sunny with no precipitation.\nBackground.\nChevrolet and Toyota withdrew from the series, leaving Honda as the sole engine provider for all teams for 2006 through 2011. Three races preceded the Indy 500, and Hélio Castroneves, with two wins and one second place, held a large points lead going into the month of May.\nA new series initiative introduced the use of ethanol fuel. As part of a two-year roll-out, all entries for 2006 were required to utilize a 10% ethanol/90% methanol fuel blend (E10). Previously, from 1974 to 2005, methanol was the only fuel permitted, and from 1965 to 1973, the rules were crafted in such a fashion as to encourage the use of methanol in order to be competitive. \nTeam and driver changes.\nSeveral drivers shuffles occurred during the offseason. Defending Indy 500 winner and 2005 IndyCar champion Dan Wheldon switched from Andretti Green Racing to Ganassi. Wheldon started off the season with a victory at the season opener at Homestead. However, the race was marred by the death of Paul Dana during the morning practice session.\nMarco Andretti moved up from the Indy Lights series and took over the vacated spot at Andretti Green Racing. In December, team owner Michael Andretti announced he would come out of retirement to race at Indy, alongside his son. Similarly, owner/driver Eddie Cheever announced he would get back into the car, participating in four races, including Indy.\nTomas Scheckter moved from Panther to Vision Racing. Vítor Meira took over the vacant spot at Panther, leaving the Rahal team. Paul Dana was signed as the third car for RLR, but was replaced by Jeff Simmons after his tragic fatal crash. Rahal maintained the services of Buddy Rice and Danica Patrick.\nAfter a brief retirement, Al Unser Jr., who missed the 2005 race, signed with Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing. Unser would race alongside teammate Buddy Lazier, who signed on for a partial season ride at DRR.\nHemelgarn Racing signed P. J. Chesson with financial backing from NBA basketball player Carmelo Anthony. An aggressive marketing campaign nicknamed the entry \"Car Melo\", and also acquired the services of Jeff Bucknum for a two-car effort. However, by month's end, a disastrous result saw the two cars crash out together on lap 2, placing 32nd-33rd respectively. Hemelgarn subsequently closed its doors for the remainder of the season.\nPractice (week 1).\nRookie Orientation - Sunday May 7.\nOpening day featured rookie orientation and refresher tests. The day opened with the Andretti family celebrating three generations (Mario, Michael, and Marco) taking a ceremonial lap around the track together.\nMichael Andretti, Al Unser Jr., and Arie Luyendyk Jr. participated in refresher tests. Rookies P. J. Chesson and Marco Andretti passed the four-phase rookie test. Townsend Bell took only \"shake down\" laps. Michael Andretti (220.999 mph) was the fastest car of the day.\nRookie Orientation - Monday May 8.\nThe second day of rookie orientation saw Thiago Medeiros pass the rookie test. Townsend Bell (221.381 mph) was the fastest car of the day.\nTuesday May 9.\nThe first full day of veteran practice. Sam Hornish Jr. (224.811 mph) was the fastest car of the day.\nWednesday May 10.\nSam Hornish Jr. (226.056 mph) was the fastest car of the day. The track closed early due to rain at 3:30 p.m.\nThursday May 11.\nRain delayed the start of practice until nearly 2 p.m. Marty Roth spun in turn two, but made no contact. Sam Hornish Jr. (226.789 mph) was the fastest car of the day.\n\"Fast\" Friday May 12.\nRain washed out practice for the day.\nTime trials (first weekend wash out).\nSaturday May 13.\nTime trials was scheduled for four days. The \"11/11/11\" format was to be utilized, with eleven positions available on pole day. However, rain washed out time trials for the day. Pole day qualifying was rescheduled for Sunday May 14.\nSunday May 14.\nThe \"11/11/11\" format was scheduled to be used, and thus 22 position were to be open for qualifying on Sunday May 14. Rain continued to fall, but the track dried shortly after 1 p.m. The cars took to the track for practice for about an hour, and Dan Wheldon turned the fastest lap of the month at 228.663 mph. At 2:15 p.m., the rain resumed, and the track was closed for the day. Time trials was washed out for the entire weekend for the first time since 1983.\nPractice (week 2).\nWednesday May 17.\nSam Hornish Jr. (224.381 mph) was the fastest car of the day. Rain closed the track early at 4:26 p.m.\nThursday May 18.\nRain kept the track closed until 3:45 p.m. Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Thiago Medeiros suffered crashes. The brief session was ended at 5:52 p.m., as rain fell again. Sam Hornish Jr. (224.381 mph) was the fastest car of the day.\n\"Fast\" Friday II May 19.\nSam Hornish Jr. (227.925 mph) was the fastest car of the day. Hornish led the speed charts on all three practice days during the second week. Marty Roth spun but made no contact. Jeff Simmons crashed in turn one, but was uninjured.\nTime trials (second weekend).\nPole Day - Saturday May 20.\nSince the first two days of time trials were rained out, 33 positions were available for time trials on May 20. The field was filled to 32 cars by the end of the day. Sam Hornish Jr., won the pole with the fastest four-lap qualifying speed of .\nOnly one driver waved off during the day. Dario Franchitti experienced engine trouble after three laps, but later completed his attempt after an engine change. Although the new qualifying rules allowed qualified cars to be withdrawn and re-qualified in hopes of gaining a better starting position (with a maximum of three attempts per day), only one driver took the opportunity to do so. Townsend Bell's qualification run of was withdrawn, and he achieved an average of on his second attempt. This improved his starting position by only one spot.\nBump Day - Sunday May 21.\nThe day opened with one position open in the field, and two drivers prepared to make an attempt. Rookie Thiago Medeiros, who had crashed his lone car on Thursday, returned to the track for practice.\nMost of the afternoon focused on race day practice for already-qualified cars. Sam Hornish Jr. (226.256 mph) led the speed charts for practice laps, capping off a month where he led the speed chart every day he took practice laps except one.\nMarty Roth was the only driver besides Medeiros that was looking to make an attempt. At 3:30 p.m., polesitter Sam Hornish Jr. spun in turn one and hit the outside wall while practicing in a backup car. He was uninjured.\nWith about an hour to go, A. J. Foyt brought a backup car to pit lane, driver Ryan Briscoe was getting settled into the car, fueling rumors of a late qualifying run.\nAt 5:08 p.m., Thiago Medeiros completed a qualifying attempt, and filled the field to 33 cars, however he was slowest and now on the bubble.\nWith 23 minutes left in the day, Marty Roth spun during a practice run, and crashed into the outside wall in turn 1. He was not injured, but the car was wrecked, and his chances to qualify were finished. The day ended with Medeiros the only car to complete an attempt for the afternoon with Briscoe deciding against making a run.\nCarb Day - Friday May 26.\nSam Hornish Jr. once again led the speed charts (220.698 mph). It was the ninth day of the month that Hornish completed the fastest practice lap.\nPenske Racing with driver Hélio Castroneves won the 30th Annual Checker's/Rally's Indy 500 Pit Stop Challenge.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nAfter considerable rain during the month, race day was sunny and hot. Temperatures topped out at , one of the hottest days for the Indy 500 on record.\nDue to the state of Indiana observing Daylight Saving Time, the start of the race was scheduled for 1:11 p.m. EDT. Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines at 1:04 p.m. EDT, and all 33 cars pulled away for the pace laps, with Lance Armstrong driving the pace car.\nSugar Ray Leonard waved the green flag to start the race, and polesitter Sam Hornish Jr. took the lead into turn one. Down the back stretch, Hélio Castroneves passed Hornish for the lead, and Dan Wheldon moved into second. Castroneves led the opening lap.\nOn the second lap in turn two, Jeff Bucknum spun out and collected his teammate P. J. Chesson, taking both of the entries from Hemelgarn Racing out of the race and sadly out for the remainder of the season.\nFirst half.\nAfter the Hemelgarn incident, a long period of green-flag racing ensued, lasting 60 laps. During this period, Dan Wheldon dominated the race, briefly losing then regaining the lead during a round of green-flag pit stops around laps 36-39. By lap 64, Wheldon had built up a 19-second lead—nearly half a lap—over the next nearest competitor, and after 65 laps had lapped twenty-five of the other cars in the race, including all five of the other former 500 winners, leaving only eight cars on the lead lap.\nThe field tightened during a yellow flag on lap 67 due to a crash by Tomas Scheckter. The crash sent debris into the inside grandstand, injuring five spectators, none seriously. Wheldon maintained the lead through a series of pit stops, and led at the halfway point.\nSecond half.\nWheldon gave up the lead briefly during pit stop on lap 108, which allowed Scott Dixon to lead.\nOn lap 110, Hélio Castroneves struck Buddy Rice from behind, taking out both cars. It was the first time two former winners had been involved in the same crash in the Indy 500 since 1992. It was also the first time in his career that Castroneves failed to finish the race.\nSam Hornish Jr., took the lead from Wheldon on lap 130. Wheldon, however, would regain the lead on lap 145 and hold it through lap 182.\nOn lap 149, Al Unser Jr. precipitated a caution period after spinning down the back-stretch and crashing in turn 3. During the caution, Jeff Simmons left the pit area with the fuel hose nozzle still attached. The hose tore, and Simmons's car dropped the nozzle out on the track in turn 3. On lap 150, the leaders pitted. Sam Hornish Jr. started to pull out of his pits with the hose still attached. The hose ripped, but Hornish stopped in the pits allowing the crew to disengage the nozzle. Team owner Roger Penske accepted responsibility for the error, having told Hornish to go before the fueling was complete. Fuel spilled in the pit stall, but Hornish was able to return to the track and stay on the lead lap.\nStill under caution on lap 155, the field was preparing to go back to green when Jeff Simmons wrecked in the north chute. The caution was prolonged. On lap 160, Michael Andretti and Sam Hornish Jr. ducked into the pits to top off their fuel. Both would be able to make it to the finish without another pit stop. On lap 163, the green came back out with Dan Wheldon leading. Sam Hornish Jr. was assessed a \"drive-through\" penalty (being required to drive once through pit road, without stopping, obeying the pit road speed limit) for the pit violation moments earlier. Hornish returned to the track over 30 seconds behind the leader, but he was still on the lead lap.\nWith twenty laps to go, Dan Wheldon and Tony Kanaan were running nose-to-tail in 1st-2nd. All of the lead lap cars would need to make one final pit stop for fuel, except for Sam Hornish Jr. and Michael Andretti. Eighth place Hornish was less than 10 seconds ahead of Wheldon and Kanaan, barely clinging to the lead lap. Down the backstretch on lap 183, Wheldon came up on the lapped car of Kosuke Matsuura, and was momentarily blocked. Kanaan darted into the lead on the inside. But in turn three, Kanaan and Wheldon split the slower car of Max Papis, going three-wide through the northchute. Wheldon got up into the marbles in turn four, and punctured a tire. As they went through turn one on lap 184, Wheldon nearly got sideways, and he had to back off his pace. Wheldon immediately headed for the pits for tires and fuel (a few laps earlier than planned). But due to the puncture he lost several seconds on his in-lap. \nTony Kanaan was now in front, with Andretti Green Racing teammates holding the top four spots (Kanaan, Marco Andretti, Dario Franchitti, and Michael Andretti). Seven cars were on the lead lap, with Hornish in 6th and Wheldon now down to 7th, both clinging to the tail end of the lead lap.\nLate Race Caution and Finish.\nMarco Andretti, running second, went to the pits for fuel on lap 190. As Marco Andretti was pitting, Felipe Giaffone crashed in turn two, bringing out the yellow. Marco Andretti (legally) slipped by the pace car exiting the pits, and avoided losing a lap in the shuffle. Leader Tony Kanaan, who still needed to pit, was stuck out on the track as the pits were closed at the onset of the yellow. The pits re-opened as the field came by for lap 193. Kanaan and Dario Franchitti ducked into the pits for fuel. Fan-favorite Michael Andretti stayed out on the track, and assumed the lead. Michael had come out of retirement to race with his 19-year-old son Marco, who cycled up to second place. In his 15th Indy 500, Michael was still looking for his first Indy victory. Scott Dixon was lined up third, and Sam Hornish Jr. was now up to fourth.\nThe green came out with 4 laps to go. Michael Andretti led the field, with his son Marco close behind in second. Hornish made a desperate pass deeper in the field, and emerged in third place as the field exited turn 2.\nWith three laps to go, Marco Andretti pulled outside of his father down the frontstretch, and passed his father for the lead in turn 1. Marco began to pull away as Michael now assumed a blocking role to protect his son's lead. Down the backstretch, Michael tried but failed to hold off the charging Hornish, and Hornish took over second place.\nWith two laps to go, Marco led Hornish by a half second, with Michael still in third. Down the backstretch, Hornish tried to squeeze past Marco as they approached turn three. He was pinched down, and ran out of race track, and had to back off. Hornish lost his momentum, and Marco pulled out to a 1-second lead at the start/finish line with one lap to go.\nOn the final lap, Marco held his lead down the back stretch. In turn three, however, Hornish began to reel him in. As the two cars exited turn four, Hornish executed a slingshot pass in the final 400 feet. He beat Marco Andretti to the finish line by 0.0635 seconds, the equivalent of about . It was the second-closest finish in Indy 500 history. It was also the first time in Indy history that a driver made a pass for the lead to win the race on the final lap.\nAfterwards, Hornish commented on his last-second pass, \"I figured I came all this way, I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what.\"\nThird-place finisher Michael Andretti had high praise for his son: \"I felt so bad for Marco, but I'm so proud. He drove a hell of a race. I drove with him a hell of a lot in that race. He drove like a champion. He drove like he's been out there 10 years.\" But Marco wanted more: \"I do not want to wait until next year. I have to take advantage of everything because second's nothing,\" he said.\nAfter leading 148 laps, 2005 winner Dan Wheldon failed in his bid to win back-to-back races. He recovered from the punctured tire on lap 183 to finish in the top five. On the final lap, while most of the attention was focused on Andretti and Hornish, Wheldon slipped by Tony Kanaan for position going into turn three, and came home fourth.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. Mike King served as chief announcer.\nFor the second year in a row, pit reporter Kevin Olson conducted a pre-race interview with David Letterman. This would be the final 500 on the radio for Adam Alexander.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports, except in Indianapolis on WRTV, where it was tape delayed to primetime due to the seats not completely sold out. After a critically unpopular season as chief announcer for the IndyCar series on ABC/ESPN, Todd Harris was removed from the broadcast booth. Veteran announcer Marty Reid took over as play-by-play. Scott Goodyear returned as driver analyst. Joining them in the booth was 1989 NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Rusty Wallace, who served as co-analyst with Goodyear.\nFor the first time ever, the broadcast utilized the Side-By-Side feature during commercial breaks. This was also the final \"500\" broadcast solely in standard-definition."

He was also named to the 1964 AFL All-Star team.\n1965.\nJOE NAMATH, quarterback, New York Jets (UPI, TSN)\nChoosing the American Football League's Jets (and $427,000) over the NFL, Namath was 164 of 340 for 2,220 yards and 18 touchdowns in his rookie season for the Jets, and was selected to the 1965 AFL All-Star team.\n1966.\nBOBBY BURNETT, halfback, Buffalo Bills (UPI, TSN)\nArkansas' Bobby Burnett had a combined total of 1,185 yards rushing and receiving at the halfback position, with over 12 yards per catch and 4 touchdowns on 34 receptions, and 766 yards on 187 rushes, with 4 rushing touchdowns. He was also selected to the 1966 AFL All-Star team.\n1967.\nGeorge Webster created the \"roverback\" position, as a linebacker with a defensive back's moves and speed. He started as a rookie and had 15 tackles in his first game. The Oilers' defense held opponents under 200 points in 1967, helping them win the East Division title. He averaged more than ten tackles a game and was first-team All-AFL in 1967.\nAP selected Webster as their defensive Rookie of the Year and selected Dickie Post as AP AFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.

        "text": "The European Rugby Champions Cup is an annual rugby union competition for European clubs whose countries compete in the Six Nations Championship. Introduced in 2014, the competition replaced the Heineken Cup, which had been run by European Rugby Cup (ERC) since 1995, following disagreements between its shareholders over the structure and governance of the competition.\nIt is organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), with teams qualifying via their final positions in their respective national/cross-border leagues (Premiership, Top 14, and Pro14). The winners of the first final were French team Toulouse, who beat Welsh side Cardiff 21–18 after extra time.\n20 teams initially compete in five separate pools. The top eight teams from the pools progress to the knockout stage. If the score in a knockout match is a draw after 80 minutes of regular play, an additional 20-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If the score remains tied, an additional 10 minutes of sudden-death extra time are played, with the first team to score points immediately declared the winner. If no team is able to break the tie during extra time, the winner is ultimately decided by a penalty shootout. As well as the first final, the 2005 final between French teams Toulouse and Stade Français went to extra time, which Toulouse won 18–12.\nToulouse are the most successful team in the history of the tournament, with five wins. Leinster have won the competition four times, while Toulon and Saracens are third with three wins. Toulon are the only team to have won three consecutive tournaments, from 2013 to 2015. Three teams have played in more than one final and failed to win any of them – Clermont three times, Racing 92, Stade Français and Biarritz twice. No teams from Scotland and Italy have progressed to the final.\nThe 2017–18 final was held in Bilbao, marking the first time that the final was contested in a country without a team participating in the competition. The 2020–21 final was relocated from Marseille to London. and the 2021–22 final was held in Marseille instead."

        "text": "Slovenia competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\nAlpine skiing.\nEntering the Games, no Slovenian man was ranked in the top 20 of the World Cup standings in any alpine event, but they achieved several top-20 finishes in Turin, with the best a 12th place in the giant slalom from Mitja Valenčič. On the women's side, Tina Maze was ranked 5th in GS, but the top showing came from her team-mate Ana Drev, who posted one of the strongest second runs to end up 9th.\nBiathlon.\nThe Slovenian flagbearer, Tadeja Brankovič, contributed to the biathlon team's top finish in Turin, the 6th place earned by the women's relay. Teja Gregorin was the best individual performer, placing in the top-20 in all of her races. The best performance in the relay, however, came from neither Brankovič nor Gregorin, but from Dijana Grudiček, who pulled the team up as high as 5th.\nCross-country skiing.\nPetra Majdič was Slovenia's top cross-country skier in Turin, finishing 6th in the women's 10 km, and the only skier to proceed out of the qualifying rounds in the sprint. Majdič advanced to the semifinals, but placed 4th in her semi and in the B Final en route to an 8th place finish.\nFigure skating.\nUrbas, who had placed 17th at the most recent European Championships, was second-to-last after the short program, and did not advance to compete in the free skate.\nKey: CD = Compulsory Dance, FD = Free Dance, FS = Free Skate, OD = Original Dance, SP = Short Program\nFreestyle skiing.\nMiha Gale was scheduled to compete, but pulled out after an injury in training, leaving Nina Bednarik as the only Slovenian freestyle skier competing in Turin.\nLuge.\nDomen Pociecha was the only Slovenian lugist in Turin. He was one of the weaker starters, but nonetheless managed to finish 26th, ahead of 10 other competitors.\nNordic combined.\nDamjan Vtič competed in two events as the sole Slovenian Nordic combined athlete in Turin; his best finish was 34th in the sprint.\nNote: 'Deficit' refers to the amount of time behind the leader a competitor began the cross-country portion of the event. Italicized numbers show the final deficit from the winner's finishing time.\nSki jumping.\nSlovenia was the defending Olympic and World bronze medalists in the team event, but struggled in Turin, finishing tenth, and not qualifying for the second round of jumps. Rok Benkovič, who was the defending world champion, in the normal hill event, had a very poor first jump in the final, ending up 49th. The best individual performance came from Jernej Damjan, who was 28th in the large hill event.\nNote: PQ indicates a skier was pre-qualified for the final, based on entry rankings.\nSnowboarding.\nFour snowboarders represented Slovenia in Turin, all in the parallel giant slalom. Two, Rok Flander and Dejan Kosir, qualified for the knockout stages, and advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to a Schoch brother, Flander to Philipp and Kosir to Simon. The two ended up 7th and 6th, respectively, after each faced two other Swiss racers in the consolation rounds.\nKey: '+ Time' represents a deficit; the brackets indicate the results of each run."

        "title": "1971 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 55th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was a motor race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Saturday, May 29, 1971. Al Unser Sr. won for the second consecutive year, dominating most of the race. Unser became the fourth driver to win the Indy 500 in back-to-back years, and it was his second of a record-tying four Indy victories.\nThe race was marred by a crash involving the pace car at the start. Eldon Palmer, a local Indianapolis-area Dodge dealer, lost control of the Dodge Challenger pace car at the south end of the pit area, and it crashed into a photographers' stand, injuring 29 people, two seriously.\nPeter Revson started on the pole with a record speed of , more than a mile per hour faster than any other qualifier, with defending Indy 500 winner and USAC National Champion Al Unser in the middle of the second row. Mark Donohue, who qualified in the middle of the front row, took the lead at the start of the race and led the first 50 laps. A mechanical issue ended his day, however, on lap 66, at which time Unser assumed the lead. He and Joe Leonard swapped the lead several times during the middle portion of the race, but Unser led for the final 83 laps, giving him a win for the second year in a row. He was the first to successfully defend his title since Bill Vukovich won in 1953–1954.\nUnser became the first and only driver to-date to win the race on his birthday (32nd); which was also coincidentally the first time the race had ever been held on May 29, and he also became the first winner to celebrate in the new victory lane. The new winner's area, now featuring black and white checkered ramps, was moved from the south end of the pits to the \"horseshoe\" area immediately below the Master Control Tower, near the start/finish line.\nThe 1971 Indy 500 was part of the newly re-organized USAC Marlboro Championship Trail, in which dirt tracks were separated from the paved ovals and road courses. From then on, the Gold Crown championship schedule would consist solely of paved tracks (both ovals and road courses), giving the national championship a decidedly new look for the 1970s and beyond. In addition, with 500-mile races at Ontario and Pocono now on the schedule, Indy car racing formed its first \"triple crown.\"\nThe city of Indianapolis celebrated its Sesquicentennial in 1971, and the occasion was reflected on the bronze and silver pit badges for the month of May. During the week leading up to the race, Indianapolis was also the site of 1971 NATO International Conference of Cities.\nRace schedule.\nIn the days leading up to the race, Speedway officials announced that female reporters would be allowed in the pit area and garage area for the first time.\nFor this race, and again in 1972, the race was scheduled for the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act had taken effect in 1971, and the Speedway moved the race off of its original traditional fixed date of May 30. Through 1970, Memorial Day was a fixed date holiday observed on May 30 regardless of the day of the week. From 1911 to 1970, the race was scheduled for May 30, regardless of the day of the week, unless May 30 fell on a Sunday. In those cases, the race would be scheduled for Monday May 31. In 1973, it was scheduled for Monday (but rain delayed it until Wednesday), and from 1974 onward, it was scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.\nFor 1971, the traditional Carburetion Day practice, held on Wednesday May 26, was officially open to the public for the first time.\nTime trials.\nFor the first time, USAC firmed up the rules regarding pole day qualifying. As had been done in previous years, a blind draw would be held to determine the order of qualifying on pole day. However, starting in 1971, all drivers/cars in the original qualifying draw order would be allowed the opportunity to make at least one attempt in the pole round regardless if rain halted the session and pushed it off to another day. Previously, if rain interrupted the qualifying line on pole day, any cars left in the original qualifying order at the time the track closed because of weather or the track closing at 6:00 p.m. were deemed to qualify on the next round.\nDuring practice, McLaren arrived at the track with the new M16 chassis, drawing attention and some controversy due to presence of a large rear wing affixed to the engine cover. USAC rules through 1971 required that any aerodynamic devices were to be an integral part of the bodywork. After inspection, officials ultimately approved the device, as McLaren argued it was part of the engine cover. The engine cover was not much more than a flat, plate-like shape that ran along the top of the engine, with the wing affixed to the rear. As practice began, the McLaren entries quickly established themselves as favorites for the pole position.\nPole Day - Saturday May 15.\nMcLaren M16 cars dominated qualifying during a record-shattering afternoon. The chassis took 1st, 2nd, and 4th starting positions, but the results were not without some surprise. Mark Donohue in the Penske-owned McLaren had broken the 180 mph barrier during practice on Thursday, establishing himself as the favorite for the pole. Donohue lucked out with an early draw on Pole Day, going out third in line. He posted a four-lap average of 177.087 mph to sit on the provisional pole. It was a new track record, but a little disappointing compared to the 180 mph lap he had two days earlier.\nLater in the day, Peter Revson, driving a works McLaren, bumped Donohue from the pole with a four-lap average of 178.696 mph. The pole position far out of reach for the rest of the field. Donohue reportedly suffered handling problems with his car during his run, purportedly as a result of his crew refusing to dial it in as he requested. Donohue then confided with his friend Revson, who then clandestinely borrowed Donohue's chassis set-up advice to knock him off the pole. Bobby Unser in an Eagle chassis, squeezed between the three McLaren cars by qualifying third.\nSecond Day - Sunday May 16.\nThree drivers completed runs, with Bud Tingelstad (170.156 mph) the fastest of the afternoon. Mike Mosley returned after two crashes the previous day, and qualified solidly over 169 mph.\nThird Day - Saturday May 22.\nA busy day saw the field filled to 33 cars car. The day concluded with Steve Krisiloff bumping out rookie Sam Posey. \nBump Day - Sunday May 23.\nStrong winds kept speeds down, and only three drivers successfully bumped their way into the field. The windy conditions led to six crashes, and hopefuls waited until the final 45 minutes before they took to the track. The session started out with Mel Kenyon bumping out Carl Williams. Bob Harkey bumped Dick Simon, and Art Pollard got back into the field by bumping Jim McElreath.\nJim Hurtubise once again tried to qualify his front-engined roadster, but on his second lap, hit the outside wall at the head of the main stretch. His first two laps would not have been fast enough to bump his way in. The day ended as Dick Simon (waved off) and Jerry Grant (waved off) made unsuccessful attempts.\nAfter qualifying, car owner Dick Simon announced he was going to take over the machine qualified by John Mahler. By rule, the car must move to the rear of the grid (33rd) on race day.\nPace car crash.\nFor 1971, none of the Big Three auto manufacturers chose to supply a pace car for the Indianapolis 500, as the muscle car market had dried up and marketing efforts were shifted elsewhere. Four local Indianapolis-area Dodge dealers, spearheaded by Eldon Palmer, stepped up to supply the fleet of pace cars. The vehicle chosen was the Dodge Challenger 383-4V. Palmer was chosen to drive the pace car at the start of the race.\nIn preparation for the race, Palmer or an aide supposedly set up an orange flag (sometimes reported as an orange traffic cone) in the pit lane to provide himself with a braking reference point. However, there has been some dispute regarding the existence of the marker at all. One account claimed it had not been there for several days. During the parade and pace lap, Tony Hulman, ABC broadcaster Chris Schenkel, and John Glenn served as passengers in the car. Palmer practiced the run the day before the race.\nAs the field came down the main stretch for the start, Palmer pulled into the pits and accelerated down the pit lane. Palmer continued to accelerate, under the impression that he was required to cross the start/finish line in the pit area prior to, or at the same time, as the race cars doing so out on the track. His reference flag (or cone) had been removed and he missed his planned braking spot. Moving upwards of perhaps , Palmer realized he was going too fast, and rather than perilously veering back on to the racing surface, he braked heavily and lost control. Palmer had refused to blame the car, stating afterwards that \"the equipment was good, disc brakes. I just didn't have enough track to stop.\" However, testimony during a 1974 civil trial stated that the pace car was supposed to be ordered with power disc brakes, but was built and delivered to the track with only manual drum brakes. Furthermore, Palmer's attorney added that a security guard running out of the way effectively blocked the exit to the pits.\nThe car swerved and skidded to the end of the pit lane, and crashed into a photographers' stand. The stand toppled and collapsed, injuring 29 people, but no one was killed. Dr. Vicente Alvarez, a freelance photographer from Argentina, was one of two on the stand who were seriously injured. Alvarez survived, and died in the late 1990s. Tony Hulman suffered a sprained ankle, and a shaken Schenkel sat out the remainder of the ABC broadcast.\nPalmer maintained possession of the car, and eventually it was repaired and restored. Ultimately, Palmer himself was largely exonerated. Indiana businessman Steven Cage purchased the vehicle in 2006, and it currently is displayed at his RPM Collection in Fishers, Indiana. Reactions of the accident were very critical afterwards, and for the next several years, the pace car drivers selected were either former Indy drivers or people with racing experience.\nRace details.\nFirst half.\nDespite the pace car crash near the exit of the pits, the green light came on, and the race continued underway. Mark Donohue grabbed the lead from the middle of the front row.\nOn lap 12, Steve Krisiloff blew an engine, spilling oil in turn three. Mel Kenyon slid in the oil making contact with the turn three wall. Gordon Johncock and Mario Andretti continued to race each other through three yellow lights. When they arrived at turn three, track workers were on the scene beside the Kenyon machine. Having not heeded the yellow lights, both Johncock and Andretti slid in the oil with Johncock crashing into the Kenyon car, running over the top of it and destroying both cars. Kenyon, fortunately, had seen Johncock coming and dropped back down into the cockpit of his race car. Johncock's car left a tire mark on the top of Kenyon's helmet. The only injury received by Kenyon was a small cut on his shin from the dash board being pushed down onto his legs. All four cars were out of the race, and the yellow light was on for 19 minutes to clean up the accident.\nDonohue led the first 50 laps, then the lead traded hands during pit stops between Joe Leonard, Bobby Unser, as well as Al Unser. After leading a total of 52 laps, Mark Donohue dropped out on lap 66 with broken gears. He came to a stop in turn four, and parked the car in the infield, just north of the entrance to the pits.\nLloyd Ruby led at the halfway point.\nSecond half.\nOn lap 111, David Hobbs blew an engine on the main stretch. Rick Muther spun in the oil, his car veered to the inside wall, then bounced across the track, hitting Hobbs, and lifting up on two wheels. Hobbs' car was pushed head-on into the wall, but he was not seriously injured. Both cars slid down the main stretch, and came to a rest just beyond the start/finish line. The track was blocked except for a narrow portion on the inside where other cars were able to skirt by. The incident happened right in front of Al Unser, who was the leading the race at the moment. The yellow light came on for 12 minutes to clean up the crash.\nAfter a series of pit stops by the leaders under the yellow, the green eventually came back out with Al Unser leading.\nWith less than 40 laps to go, Al Unser continued to lead, with Peter Revson second, Bobby Unser third, and A. J. Foyt fourth.\nOn lap 167, Mike Mosley lost a wheel in turn 4. He smacked the outside wall in turn four hard, then bounced across the track and hit the inside wall. Leader Al Unser was ahead of the crash, and second place Peter Revson just slipped by. Third place Bobby Unser spun to avoid Mosley, and hit the outside wall. Mosley's car then crashed into the parked cars of Mark Donohue and Steve Krisiloff, that were sitting near the entrance to the pits. A fire broke out, at which time 8th running Gary Bettenhausen stopped his car, and ran to the scene to help. Fire crews quickly doused the flames, and Mosley suffered a broken leg. Bill Vukovich II also spun to avoid the crash, but he was able to continue. The yellow remained on for 22 minutes to clean up the crash.\nThe green light came back on with less than 20 laps to go. Al Unser held a comfortable lead, and won his second 500 in a row. Despite four yellows for 53 minutes (about 48 laps), the average speed of 157.735 mph was a new record at the time. Bettenhausen, who finished 10th, was given a cheer at the finish for stopping to help Mosley and Unser on lap 164.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. It was carried on over 1,200 affiliates, including shortwave transmission to Europe, Asia, and Vietnam. The broadcast reached an estimated 100 million listeners worldwide. Sid Collins served as chief announcer and Len Sutton served as \"driver expert.\" At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane.\nThe entire on-air crew remained mostly consistent from 1966 to 1970. Bob Forbes was assigned as \"wireless\" microphone, covering the garages and roving reports. The pre-race coverage was 30 minutes long. In a departure from previous years, Sid Collins decided to eliminate booth interviews with celebrities during the race. The only exception was an interview with Hugh Downs, but that was during the post-race coverage. In addition, Luke Walton interviewed Evel Knievel in the pit area during the early stages of the race. Knievel was making his first visit to the 500, as a guest of the A. J. Foyt team.\nTelevision.\nFor the first time, the race was carried in the United States the same day the race was held, on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. The race was held in the afternoon, and the broadcast aired in prime time later in the day.\nThe broadcast totaled two hours, and came on-air at 8:30 p.m. (eastern). Among the notable appearances, was David Letterman, at the time employed by then-ABC Indianapolis affiliate WLWI, who served as a roving turn reporter. Letterman interviewed Mario Andretti after he dropped out of the race.\nChris Schenkel began what would be a decade-long tenure as host, while Jim McKay anchored the broadcast as play-by-play announcer. But Schenkel's day as host was short. Riding in (and broadcasting from) the pace car at the start of the race, he was slightly injured when the pace car crashed after coming into the pits at the start of the race.\nThe broadcast was re-aired numerous times on ESPN Classic from February 2002 until the network's shutdown at the end of 2021.

        "title": "1972 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 56th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Saturday, May 27, 1972. The race is notable in that for the first time, the cars were permitted bolt-on wings, and speeds climbed dramatically. Bobby Unser won the pole position at a then-remarkable speed of for four laps, breaking Peter Revson's track record of from 1971 by – the largest one-year track record increase in Indy history. The race average speed of was also a new record, which stood until 1984.\nGary Bettenhausen led 138 laps until his car suffered ignition trouble on lap 176, and he coasted to the pits. Jerry Grant took over the lead, but pitted for a new tire and fuel on lap 188 in teammate Bobby Unser's pit - for which he was later disqualified. Bettenhausen's Penske teammate Mark Donohue won the race, after leading only the final 13 laps. It was owner Roger Penske's first of nineteen Indy 500 victories (as of 2023) and the first victory for a McLaren chassis at Indy. Al Unser Sr., who won the race in 1970 and 1971, was looking to become the first driver in history to \"three-peat\" at the Indianapolis 500. He fell short, but his runner-up finish ties for the best three-year span (1st-1st-2nd) in Indy history.\nFor the first time, Jim Nabors was invited to sing \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" during the pre-race ceremonies. Nabors accepted and performed with little rehearsal and was warmly received. It was the beginning of a 36-year tradition, where Nabors performed nearly every year from 1972 through 2014.\nThe 1972 race was the first to utilize the Electro-PACER Light system to facilitate the yellow light periods. Speedway officials still did not utilize the pace car during cautions, and this enforcement tool would be used at Indy for seven years, albeit not without controversy in subsequent races. This system was similar in concept to systems such as the Virtual Safety Car and the \"Slow zone\" that became popular in the 2010s. Although the technology for the Electro-PACER system was primitive compared to the later systems used over forty years later.\nAfter the decade of the 1960s saw numerous drivers from Europe and other nationalities, the 1972 race was the first since 1962 and the last to have an all-American lineup. Mario Andretti who was born in Istria (part of Italy at the time) was a naturalized U.S. citizen at the time of this race.\nRace schedule.\nFollowing the pattern set in 1970 and 1971, the race was scheduled for the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. This would be the final Indy 500 scheduled for a Saturday (the 1986 race was held on a Saturday due to a week-long rain delay). Falling on May 27, it was also the earliest calendar date that race had been held up to that point. In 1973, the race would be scheduled for Monday, and starting in 1974, the race would permanently move to the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.\nOn Sunday May 28, the annual 500 Victory Banquet was held at the newly completed Indiana Convention Center for the first time.\nPractice and time trials.\nIn 1972, for the first time, USAC allowed bolt-on wings to be affixed the cars. Previously, \"wings\" were required to be integral parts of the car's bodywork. Downforce levels increased by significant margins, and speeds climbed substantially during practice. During a tire test in March, Bobby Unser reportedly drove a lap of 190.8 mph, the first driver ever to lap the Speedway unofficially at over 190 mph.\nThe existing official track record going into the month had been set by Peter Revson in 1971 at 179.354 mph. During the first week of practice, the stage was set for record speeds early on. During the first day the track was available, Sunday April 30, Jim Malloy became the first driver to break the 180 mph barrier in practice, at 181.415 mph. Later in the week, Malloy ran a practice lap of 188.048 mph, by far an unofficial track record. By the end of the first week of practice, 11 drivers had practiced over 180 mph.\nDuring the second week of practice, Gary Bettenhausen turned a lap of 190.315 mph on Sunday May 7. He became the first driver ever of the month to break 190 mph. Two days later, Bettenhausen was over 191 mph. Not to be upstaged, on Wednesday May 10, Bobby Unser blistered the track at 194.721 mph.\nBy the eve of pole day, three drivers had cracked the 190 mph barrier in practice, and more than a dozen had practiced faster than the existing qualifying record.\nFirst day time trials – Saturday May 13.\nPole day time trials were scheduled for Saturday May 13, however, rain kept the track closed most of the day. The track opened briefly for practice, and at 5:50 p.m. time trials began. Three cars made it on the track, but none of them completed runs. A. J. Foyt was the last car out, but he blew his engine in turn two right after taking the green flag.\nSecond day time trials – Sunday May 14.\nPole qualifying was moved into Sunday, and the qualifying line picked up where it had left off the day before. The track opened for practice promptly at 9 a.m. At 10:21 a.m., Jim Malloy slid high exiting turn 3, and hit the outside wall in the north short chute. He suffered fractured arms and legs, burns, and was in critical condition. Four days later, Malloy would die from his injuries.\nAfter the Malloy crash, rain closed the track until 2:30 p.m. Bill Vukovich II was the first driver to make a qualifying attempt. His first lap of 185.797 mph was a new one-lap track record, and the first official lap at Indy over 180 mph. However, he did a 360° spin in turn one, and came to rest against the outside wall on the second lap, and the run was for naught. Mike Mosley went out next, but the car quit on the final lap. More rain fell, and the track closed for another hour to wait out the shower.\nAt 4:15 p.m., Joe Leonard (185.223 mph) became the first driver to complete a qualifying run. He set one and four-lap records, but they would not last long. Mario Andretti (187.617 mph) was the next car out, and he took over the top spot temporarily, also breaking the track record in the process.\nShortly before 5 p.m., Bobby Unser took to the track. He set new all-time one and four-lap qualifying records, becoming the first driver to officially break the 190 mph barrier at Indianapolis.\nUnser established himself as the man to beat for the pole position. He shattered the previous year's track record by over 17 mph. Twelve cars completed runs and the 6 o'clock gun closed the track with six cars still left in line. The pole position round would be stretched into the following weekend. Among those not yet on the track were Mark Donohue and Peter Revson. After blowing his engine Saturday, A. J. Foyt was ineligible for the pole, and was not yet in the field either.\nThird Day – Saturday May 20.\nSix cars entered the day still eligible for the pole round, and five of those made attempts. Mark Donohue put himself on the front row with a run of 191.408 mph. Moments later, Peter Revson put himself second with a run of 192.885 mph. Bobby Unser held on to the pole position, and the front of the field was set. For the first time since 1940–1941, the same three drivers qualified on the front row in consecutive years. Unser, Revson, and Donohue started on the front row (albeit in different order) in 1971 as well.\nAt 11:30 a.m., \"third day\" qualifying commenced. A. J. Foyt put his car solidly in the field with 188.996 mph. Two-time defending race winner Al Unser, Sr. also qualified. The fastest of the \"third day\" qualifiers would be Jerry Grant, with a run of 189.294 mph.\nAt the end of the day, the field was filled to 27 cars.\nBump Day – Sunday May 21 (Jim Hurtubise \"Beer engine\").\nAfter blowing five engines during the month, Gordon Johncock finally put a car in the field. His speed of 188.511 mph would be the fastest of the day (8th-fastest overall), and he qualified in 26th.\nAt 5 p.m., Salt Walther filled the field to 33 cars. Wally Dallenbach (178.423 mph) was now on the bubble. Dallenbach survived three attempts, but was eventually bumped by Cale Yarborough with a half-hour remaining. Yarborough (178.864 mph) beat Dallenbach's time by a mere 0.50 seconds, however, Yarborough himself was now on the bubble. An agonizing final 25 minutes saw six drivers try to bump him out. One by one, they each fell short. Seconds before the 6 o'clock gun, Wally Dallenbach got in a back-up car for one last chance. His first two laps were just shy of bumping in, and on his third lap, the car began smoking. He was forced to pull into the pits and wave off the run. The field was set with Yarborough holding on to make the field. All 33 cars in the field qualified faster than the pole car from the previous year.\nAs the attention on the track was focusing on Cale Yarborough, Jim Hurtubise wheeled his Gohr Distributing-sponsored Mallard roadster in the qualifying line shortly before the closing deadline of 6 p.m. Gohr Distributing was a Buffalo-area beer distributor for various brands of beer, and they promoted the Miller High Life brand on the car. Since Hurtubise had already qualified himself, when asked why he was putting the car in line, he claimed he 'might put someone else in it,' a practice that was commonplace at the time. Hurtubise had become known for last-minute (unsuccessful) qualifying efforts in his obsolete front-engined roadster, usually to the delight of fans, but sometimes drawing the ire of others. Time expired before the Mallard got anywhere near the front of the line. In fact, Hurtubise purposely queued the car late on purpose so it would not make it to the front. The engine cover was then removed to reveal that car had no engine. Instead it had a plastic-lined trough filled with ice and a number of chilled bottles of his sponsor's product, which he shared with the other pit crews and race officials. Most in attendance found the gesture to be humorous, however, some officials were not amused. Some were even becoming skeptical before he opened the cover, as already melting ice was leaving a trail of water visible on the pit lane beneath the car. It would be the first of several run-ins Hurtubise would have with USAC officials. This type of stall tactic infuriated officials, which made further rule changes to prevent this ruse. (In modern times, alcohol is prohibited in the pit area owing to WADA Code that prohibits alcohol among participants in motorsport events.) As a result, cars are now subject to cursory inspection, even before arriving at the official technical inspection area, and must obtain a sticker from officials to notify officials the car has been approved before entering the qualifying line.\nCarburetion Day.\nDuring practice on May 16, Art Pollard wrecked his qualified car. The team was forced to replace it with a back-up car. Pollard, however, suffered a fractured leg, and was out for the remainder of the month. The team hired Wally Dallenbach (who had been bumped) to drive as a substitute. For race day, the car was moved to the 33rd starting position due to the car/driver change.\nThe final practice session was scheduled for Wednesday May 24 from 1-4 p.m. Gordon Johncock (186.4 mph) was the fastest car of the day. No accidents were reported, and two drivers (John Mahler and Carl Williams) skipped the session altogether.\nElectro-PACER Light System / Rule changes.\nThe Carburetion Day practice session was expanded to allow the drivers more opportunity to practice under the new Electro-PACER Light system. The new devices were installed around the track to facilitate enforcement of the caution periods. At the time, the pace car was not utilized during caution periods, nor did the field pack up under yellow.\nThe PACER system featured a series of eight message panels situated around the track at equal intervals. They were programmed to enforce an 80 mph speed limit during caution periods. Drivers were instructed to hold their position under yellow, and each message board around the track would display a number from 1 to 9, illustrating the gap between themselves and the car in front of him. The goal and the requirement was to keep the numbers consistent at all of the boards around the entire circuit. For instance, if a driver saw a \"7\" on the first board he encountered, he was to drive at such a speed that would display a \"7\" at all of the boards around the circuit for the remainder of the caution period. If he saw a \"6\" on the next board, it indicated that he was going too fast, and he would have to slow down a bit. If it displayed an \"8\" on the next board, that meant he was driving too slow, and needed to speed up slightly. Officials were stationed around the track to observe and issue penalties for violating the PACER system, which could mean a one-lap penalty for repeated abuse.\nThe Electro-PACER Light system would be used at Indianapolis from 1972 through 1978. Despite its seemingly simple format and instructions, it would be the source of ire and controversy during the years that it was used. Some drivers discovered and exploited loopholes in the system, and officials would find it more difficult to police than they expected. The PACER system would be a primitive precursor to later systems such as the Virtual Safety Car and \"Slow Zones\" introduced in the 2010s in Formula One and at Le Mans, respectively. In the end, the drivers themselves lobbied for the pack-up rule during caution periods, and it was finally adopted in 1979.\nOne additional rule change for 1972 involved the mandatory pit stops. A minimum of four pit stops (fuel hookup required) was required for 1972. The change was up from two pit stops in 1965–1967, and up from three in 1968–1971. Individual tire changes were still optional, but the rapidly increasing speeds from 1972 on would generate greater tire wear. As a result, tire changes became increasingly necessary and more common. Several drivers won the race in the 1960s without changing any tires, but no longer would that be practical nor feasible.\nRace summary.\nPre-race ceremonies — Jim Nabors.\nOn race morning, track president Tony Hulman was reportedly chatting with William F. Harrah, owner of Harrah's casino. Jim Nabors was accompanying Harrah as a guest at the race. Hulman recognized Nabors, and asked him if he wanted to 'sing the song' during the pre-race ceremonies. Believing that Hulman was talking about \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", Nabors agreed, and walked over to arrange with the Purdue Band. Nabors asked the band leader what key they were going to play, and it was not until that moment that he was informed he was going to be singing \"Back Home Again in Indiana\". A surprised Nabors quickly jotted the lyrics down on a sheet of paper, climbed up on a ladder, and performed the song unrehearsed. Although some contemporary accounts vary, it was nevertheless the beginning of a 36-year tradition that would see Nabors perform the song at Indianapolis nearly every year through 2014.\nStart.\nTony Hulman gave the command to start engines, and the field began to pull away for two pace laps. After the pace car crash a year earlier, the veteran driver Jim Rathmann was assigned the pace car driving duties. The passengers in the Hurst/Olds pace car included Tony Hulman, astronaut Pete Conrad, Chris Schenkel of ABC Sports, Bob Draper (Hurst), and Dolly Cole (wife of GM executive Ed Cole), believed to be the first woman ever to ride in the pace car.\nAs the field pushed off from the starting grid, A. J. Foyt's car stalled and failed to pull away. His crew hurriedly wheeled the car to the south end of the pit, and tried to figure out what was wrong with the machine. With the rest of the field gone, Foyt was possibly out of the race before the green flag. As the field was coming out of turn four, the starter held up one finger, indicating that the pace car should take the field on a second pace lap. However, at that moment the crew got Foyt's car running, and quickly pushed him away. The starter waved the pace car off the track and abruptly dropped the green flag, catching many drivers in the wrong gear to go racing and making for a ragged start. With Foyt slowly coming up to speed on the apron, the field blasted by him into turn one. Just as the race went green, rookie Salt Walther dropped out from a parts failure.\nFirst half.\nBobby Unser grabbed the lead in the first turn, and led the first 30 laps. Unser set a blistering pace with Mark Donohue and Jerry Grant running close behind. On lap 31, Bobby Unser slowed and headed to the pits with a broken ignition rotor. Unser was out of the race, and Gary Bettenhausen took the lead.\nA. J. Foyt was forced to play catch-up from the onset, but was running fast laps in the 180 mph range. His day was short, however, as he blew the turbocharger. After several lengthy pit stops, Foyt dropped out of the race. Among the early outs were Peter Revson (started 2nd) and Johnny Rutherford (started 8th). During a pit stop around lap 42, Jerry Grant and Mark Donohue battled side-by-side as they exited their stalls, and Donohue nearly crashed into the scoring pylon. Meanwhile, a fire broke out in the pit area of Wally Dallenbach, but he was able to continue.\nMike Mosley took the lead on lap 54. Two laps later, he lost a wheel and crashed into the outside wall in turn four. The impact ruptured the fuel tank, and the car caught fire as it slid down the mainstretch. Mosley unbuckled before the car came to a rest and jumped from the car trying to put out the flames. Mosley suffered burns but was not seriously injured. It was the second year in a row Mosley wrecked out in the fourth turn.\nOn lap 81, for the second time, Wally Dallenbach had a fire in the pits.\nAt the halfway point, 13 cars were out of the race. Gary Bettenhausen continued to dominate the race, and led at the halfway point. After completing 94 laps, Jim Hurtubise ran out of fuel in turn two. When the safety truck went to tow him back to the pits, they proceeded to tow him through the infield and the garage area gate rather than directly around the track back to his pit stall. He refueled and rejoined the race, but was subsequently disqualified for leaving the race track. Some feel it was a \"payback\" gesture by USAC for Hurtubise's antics on bump day regarding his 'beer engine.'\nSecond half.\nGary Bettenhausen continued to lead, pushing record speeds. Attrition began to take its toll on the field. By the 400-mile mark, eighteen cars were out of the race.\nLee Kunzman lost a wheel in turn two, bringing out a yellow light on the leader's lap 147.\nWally Dallenbach had his third fire in the pits on lap 151. The final round of scheduled pit stops occurred for the leaders around laps 160-165. Bettenhausen pitted first on lap 162, briefly giving the lead over to Jerry Grant. When Grant pitted four laps later, his long pit stop relinquished the lead back to Bettenhausen. Grant himself later theorized that, because he was running a high line to improve his Eagle-Offy's handling, he might have picked up debris that caused a puncture of his right-front tire.\nThe yellow light came on with about 27 laps to go for debris on the backstretch. When the green light came back on, Gary Bettenhausen's car seemed to hesitate. With 25 laps to go, Bettenhausen suddenly started slowing in the north end of the track. After leading 138 laps, his car quit with ignition trouble. Bettenhausen later reported that the car had also suffered a pinhole puncture in the radiator earlier in the race. Slowly losing water, the engine temperature stayed in a mostly safe range while at racing speed, but during the yellow caution period, it overheated. He limped around very slowly for a handful of laps, then parked the car in the pits for a 14th place finish.\nJerry Grant blasted by to take the lead, and Bettenhausen's Penske teammate Mark Donohue was now promoted to second place.\nFinish.\nWith 13 laps to go, Jerry Grant led Mark Donohue and Al Unser Sr. Grant was forced to make a pit stop on lap 188 to change a bad tire. Grant entered the pit area, but he overshot his own pit stall and instead pulled into the pit box of his teammate Bobby Unser (Unser was already out of the race). Grant's crew carried their equipment to Unser's pit box and serviced Grant's right front tire. In the confusion, Unser's crew refueled Grant's car with fuel from Unser's pitside tank. By the time Grant went back out on the race track, he had lost the lead.\nWith Grant's unscheduled pit stop, Mark Donohue took the lead on lap 188. Grant dropped to second place on the track. Donohue had about a one-lap lead over Grant, and third place Al Unser was two laps down. Mike Hiss spun in the south shortchute between turns 1 and 2 on lap 194, but did not hit the wall. Hiss continued, and the yellow light was on for less than one minute. The green flag came back out with five laps to go.\nDonohue led the final 13 laps, and scored his first Indy 500 victory, and the first Indy victory for car owner Roger Penske. Per the rules of the time, the remainder of the field was permitted to continue racing for about five minutes after Donohue took the checkered flag. During that time, Sam Posey and Mario Andretti made pit stops, with Posey taking on fuel and returning to the track to finish 5th. Andretti was out of fuel, and dropped from 5th to 8th in the final standings.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the finish, USAC official Frank Delroy announced there would be no penalty for Grant pitting in the wrong stall. The initial ruling was that no fuel actually flowed into the tank. However, the decision would be further investigated during the evening, and a final ruling would be made when official results posted at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.\nPost race.\nJerry Grant penalty.\nThe morning after the race, USAC officials penalized Jerry Grant for taking fuel from Bobby Unser's pit tank. They disqualified him from that point on, and erased the final 12 laps from his tally. He was officially scored as out of the race with 188 laps completed. The penalty elevated Al Unser Sr. to second place, and dropped Grant to 12th finishing position. According to the rules, each car was allotted a strict limit of only 250 gallons of methanol in their pit-side tank (not including the fuel in the car at the start of the race) to complete the full 500 miles.\nThe details of the pit snafu were never fully explained, and remains a topic of discussion among historians and fans. The team maintained that fueling the car was an unintentional mistake, however, others felt otherwise. It has been reported by some witnesses that Grant was directed into Unser's pit stall by the crew, while others believe Grant simply overshot his own stall. Several possible theories emerged, with one prevailing opinion suggesting that Grant's car was out of fuel, and his pit-side tank was also empty, due to him running high turbocharger boost during the race. Grant supposedly needed a splash of fuel to make it to the finish, and since Bobby Unser dropped out early, his pit-side tank was still mostly full. It was thought that Grant deliberately stopped in Unser's pit, aware of the predicament, and knowing Unser's tank would fill his car sufficiently and quicker. Another claim was made to Grant's defense that while the fuel hose was admittedly hooked up, no fuel actually flowed into the car. This claim was quickly dismissed. Grant maintained later in life the infraction was unintentional, maintained his innocence, and felt the penalty was unjust.\nPost-race notes.\nMark Donohue won the race leading only the final 13 laps, the third-lowest total in Indy history to that point (Joe Dawson led two laps in 1912, and Graham Hill led ten laps in 1966). The race was slowed five times for cautions for only 20 minutes. Donohue's average speed of 162.962 mph set a new race record that would last until 1984.\nVanguard Racing (of which Leonard W. Miller was involved), became the first African American-owned team to enter a car in the Indy 500. John Mahler (who was white) served as the driver. He dropped out after 99 laps with a broken piston.\nBox score.\nDonohue finished the race distance with a time of 3:04:05.54. The top four racers were given additional time after his finish to complete the 500 mile race distance; 5th place and below was flagged off the track without having done so.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nNote: Jim Hurtubise completed 171 laps which would have unofficially placed him 16th, but he was penalized for being towed through the infield on lap 94, and all subsequent laps were disallowed. Car owner Dick Sommers filed a protest, but it was denied.\nPace car.\nThe Pace Car was a 1972 Hurst/Olds convertible with a Hurst Performance modified 455 cubic inch W-30 engine built to pre-smog high compression 1970 specs. It was equipped with a TH-400 transmission and a \"His and Hers\" Hurst Dual Gate shifter, plus a 3.42 rear axle ratio. An all aluminum W-27 differential cover was used for weight and cooling purposes. Mark Donohue was given the car for winning the race that day. About 629 of these cars were built for public consumption of which 130 were convertibles, 220 with sunroofs and the remaining 279 being hardtops. Almost all of these Pace Car replicas had the less powerful L-75 455 engine and 3.23 axle. A W-30 (L-77) could be ordered but only with 1972 specs netting 300HP with only 8.5 compression. All were painted Cameo white and carried unique 3M Firefrost Gold reflective fade out(pin dotted) laser stripes. In addition to this package, special Indy Pace Car decals with festival stickers could be ordered with large H/O stickers adorning the quarter panels.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. It was carried on over 1,200 affiliates, including shortwave transmission to Japan, Vietnam, the Arctic and Antarctic. The broadcast reached an estimated 100 million listeners worldwide. Sid Collins served as chief announcer and Len Sutton served as \"driver expert\" for the seventh and final time. At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane.\nSid Collins celebrated his milestone 25th year as chief announcer. During the pre-race coverage, Governor Edgar Whitcomb presented Collins with the Distinguished Hoosier Award, a recognition from American Forces Network, and a personalized letter of recognition from President Richard Nixon. Indianapolis mayor Dick Lugar likewise presented Collins with a silver microphone and declared May 27, 1972, as \"Sid Collins Day\".\nThe entire on-air crew remained mostly consistent from 1966 to 1971. Bob Forbes was assigned as \"wireless\" microphone, covering the garages and roving reports. For 1972, the pre-race coverage expanded from 30 minutes to 45 minutes and came on-air at 10:15 a.m. local time. Howdy Bell's vantage point in turn two (an observation spot against the outside of the retaining wall), would be the final time reporting from that location. Starting in 1973, the vantage point would move to the new VIP Suites.\nJim Shelton (born May 27, 1919), who was reporting his 23rd race on the crew, was also celebrating his 53rd birthday.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. The race was held in the afternoon, and the broadcast aired in prime time later in the day. The two and a half hour broadcast was hosted by Chris Schenkel. Jim McKay and Jackie Stewart served as booth announcers. Chris Economaki was one of the pit reporters. Keith Jackson and Stu Nahan hosted a separate 30-minute trackside report before the ABC telecast that was available to some viewers on the west coast."

        "text": "The 57th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Wednesday, May 30, 1973. The race was held over three days due to rain and suffered two major accidents. Three competitors - two drivers and one pit crew member - died from injuries suffered as a result of accidents that occurred during the month, another driver was critically injured, and over a dozen spectators suffered injuries and/or burns. After 133 laps (), rain halted the race, and Gordon Johncock was declared the winner, the first of his two Indy triumphs (1973, 1982).\nGoing into the month, the mood was bright and excitement was high for record speeds. Competitors, media, and fans were eagerly anticipating the possibility of breaking the elusive and daunting barrier during time trials. The month took a tragic turn, however, when driver Art Pollard died in a crash during a practice session on May 12, 1973. Later that same day, Johnny Rutherford set a new track record during time trials. His best lap at fell just short of breaking the highly sought-after speed barrier. Despite Rutherford's headlines on pole day, the mood meanwhile around the garage area was becoming anxious and uncertain. Fears were growing about rising speeds and safety. Inclement weather was also interfering.\nThe race was scheduled for Monday May 28, but was aborted due to a major accident at the start. Driver David \"Salt\" Walther was critically injured and numerous spectators in the track boxes and first few rows of the Paddock grandstands suffered burns from a fireball resulting from the accident. Numerous spectators required hospitalization, and some were left in critical condition; with the blast of heat felt as much as 100 yards away. Although it doesn't show up on the TV broadcasts and films, the fireball actually was a somewhat bluish flame, from eyewitness accounts. Also, rain mercifully washed out the day during the red flag period, as two vertical stanchions of the outside catchfence were broken and needed to be repaired before any racing could resume. Rain also washed out any chance to hold the race on Tuesday May 29 as well. Only a fraction of the typical Indy crowd arrived to watch the race by the time it was run on Wednesday May 30; and in fact since schools were closed in Speedway and within a few miles around west Indianapolis due to traffic, many hundreds of schoolkids and parents were bussed in to fill the grandstands for free.\nThe Wednesday race suffered two separate fatal accidents. The first involved driver David \"Swede\" Savage; the second, Armando Teran, a pit crew member for Graham McRae, the STP teammate to Savage, when Teran stepped out into the pit lane and was hit by a safety truck going in the opposite direction. Both occurred at lap 59 of the race. Owing to the tragic circumstances, relentless weather problems, rain-shortened finish, and overall glum mood during the month, the 1973 race is widely considered the worst year for the running of the Indianapolis 500. In contemporary accounts, the race had been called \"jinxed\" by Dan Gurney, Chris Economaki, and Jim McKay. Statistically, it was the track's deadliest month of May since 1937.\nNational media opinions, as well as those from team owners and crew, were highly critical in the aftermath of the race, focusing mainly on inadequate safety measures. The circumstances led to sweeping rule changes by USAC, some made effective for the Schaefer 500 at Pocono Raceway four weeks later. Numerous safety improvements were made to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway track itself that were completed for 1974.\nOff the track, the Speedway had completed construction of its first VIP Suites outside of turn two. Following in the footsteps of Ontario Motor Speedway, Indianapolis becomes the second major racing facility to feature luxury boxes.\nRace schedule.\nIn 1971, the Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect, moving Memorial Day from the fixed date of May 30 to the final Monday in May. For 1971 and 1972, the race was held on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. The Speedway still maintained a policy of not holding the race on a Sunday, and for 1973, the race was scheduled for the Monday Memorial Day holiday itself (May 28). The change was made after requests from spectators, many complaining that it was inconvenient to the many people who had to work on Saturdays.\nThe 500 Festival Committee had a desire to move their annual parade downtown to Saturday afternoon. Since its inception in 1957, in most years the parade was held at night during the week. For 1973, the parade was held Saturday, the public driver's meeting was scheduled for Sunday, and the race was scheduled for Monday. This schedule would stay in place for only one year. A decision was made that starting in 1974, the race would permanently move to Sunday.\nPractice and time trials.\nPractice.\nJust one year prior, USAC began allowing bolt-on wings. The increased downforce increased lap speeds nearly in just three years. The dramatic rise went from in 1970, to flirting with the barrier for 1973. During Goodyear tire tests in late March, Gordon Johncock set an unofficial track record of . Experts and officials agree that the safety features in the cars were not prepared for the speeds attained. In addition, engine development with the turbocharged version of the venerable I-4 Offenhauser had resulted in horsepower readings in high-boost qualifying trim in excess of . According to Mario Andretti, this was sufficient to induce rear wheelspin on the \"short chutes\" between turns 1 and 2 and turns 3 and 4—an unnerving sensation for even the bravest, most skilled and experienced of drivers.\nThe track opened on Saturday April 28 with Gary Bettenhausen earning the honor of \"first driver on the track\". Rain and winds plagued practice during the first week, while drivers started creeping up the speed chart. On Monday April 30, chief steward Harlan Fengler lifted the speed limit and speeds climbed quickly. Gordon Johncock set an unofficial lap of over to set the early pace. Johnny Rutherford was another member of the \"190 mph club\" with several laps in the mid-190 mph range. On May 5, Swede Savage upped the speed chart to , inching closer to the elusive mark.\nOn Sunday May 6, three drivers left the grounds to race in the NASCAR Winston 500 at Talladega. A huge crash, described as the worst crash in the history of NASCAR, put Bobby Allison and Gordon Johncock out of that race. Dick Simon, however, escaped the incident, with Simon coming home 7th. All three returned to qualify at Indy.\nRain and high winds kept speeds down in the second week of practice. Mario Andretti turned a lap of on Thursday May 10. The final day of practice before pole day was Friday May 11. From April 28 – May 11, there were only three accidents reported in practice that involved wall contact, none of which caused serious injuries.\nBy the eve of pole day, no drivers had eclipsed the barrier according to published reports, but conditions were favorable for pole day, and anticipation was high.\nPole Day – Saturday May 12 – Death of Art Pollard.\nPole day dawned sunny with high temperatures in the . Brief showers caused officials to turn on the yellow light a few times during the day, but they did not significantly affect the proceedings. An enormous crowd estimated at 250,000 arrived, anticipating the first ever 200 mph lap at Indy. Practice opened promptly at 9:00 a.m., but was quickly marred by the crash of Art Pollard. At 9:37 a.m., Pollard hit the outside wall in turn 1, spun to the inside, then flipped over, coming to a rest in turn two with flames and heavy damage. Pollard's injuries were reported to include pulmonary damage due to flame inhalation, third degree burns on both hands, face and neck, a fractured right arm, a fractured leg, and a severe spinal injury. He was pronounced dead at Methodist Hospital one hour and three minutes after the crash.\nDespite the crash, time trials began on time at 11 a.m. Peter Revson was the first driver in the field, with a fast run of . The next car out, Gary Bettenhausen, upped the mark to , just short of the existing track record.\nAt 12:29 p.m., Swede Savage took to the track, and was the first to set records. His first lap of set a one-lap record, and his four-lap speed of was also a record. The result put him tentatively on the pole.\nAt 1:37 p.m., Johnny Rutherford took to the track, and electrified the crowd into a frenzy. His third lap of was just 0.21 seconds shy of the elusive barrier. his four-lap average of secured the pole position.\nDefending race winner Mark Donohue squeezed onto the front row with a run of . In the final hour, Bobby Unser was the last driver of the day with a shot at history. He came close to Rutherford, but his four-lap average of was good enough only for second starting position.\nAt the end of the day, the field was filled to 24 cars. A. J. Foyt () and Sam Posey () were the two slowest. Foyt, who was over during the week, waved off once, and had to settle for a slow run.\nSecond day – Sunday May 13.\nA fairly busy second day of time trials saw six cars added to the field without incident. John Martin () was the fastest of the day. Posey and Foyt were still the two slowest cars in the field.\nThird Day – Saturday May 19.\nRain kept cars off the track for most of the day. Lightning, hail, and a tornado warning, emptied the grandstands at 3 p.m. In the final ten minutes, two cars (Tom Bigelow and Sammy Sessions) made it out on the track for qualifying attempts, but neither were successful. Bigelow spun on his warm up lap, and Sessions waved off.\nBump Day – Sunday May 20.\nWith three spots left open in the field, the final day of time trials was expected to be busy, but saw only moderate action. Sammy Sessions was the first car out, and completed his run, slightly slower than his run a day earlier. After a down period in the mid-afternoon, the field was filled to 33 cars at 5:37 p.m. Tom Bigelow was on the bubble.\nWith 15 minutes left in the day. Jim McElreath bumped out Tom Bigelow. Sam Posey was now on the bubble. Next out was Jim Hurtubise, but he was too slow. With one minute left before the 6 o'clock gun, George Snider got in a Foyt backup car. A fast run of bumped Posey, and the field was set.\nRace running.\nMonday May 28 – Salt Walther crash.\nOn race day, a crowd estimated at 350,000 waited as morning rain delayed the proceedings for four hours and four minutes from its original scheduled time of 11:00 a.m. Tony Hulman gave the command to start engines just after 3:00 p.m., and the field pulled away for the pace laps. Bob Harkey's car did not fire, and his crew wheeled the car back to the pits. It was discovered earlier that morning that the engine had failed. Rather than withdraw (and forfeit their starting spot to Tom Bigelow, the first alternate), the crew kept the engine issue secret, and gridded the car as normal. They worked on the car briefly to give the impression that the engine failed when the starting command was given.\nAt the start, an 11-car accident unfolded on the main stretch approximately 200 yards past the start/finish line, which halted the race immediately. As the green flag fell, Steve Krisiloff's car developed ignition problems and slowed on the front straightaway, falling back to parallel with the fifth row by the time he crossed the start/finish line. This caused the rest of the field behind Krisiloff to shuffle towards the outside to avoid the slowing car. Seconds later in the sixth row, just past the start/finish line, Salt Walther tangled wheels with Jerry Grant, climbed over Grant's left-front wheel, overturned in the air and slammed into the catch fence. The car cut a section out of the fence on impact, breaking two 4-inch steel stanchions before being thrown back onto the track by the reinforcing cables positioned behind the fence. The impact ripped open both of Walther's fuel tanks, sending 75 gallons of flaming methanol in a massive pale blue fireball (not apparent on TV or film footage) and dousing many spectators, with the blast of heat felt at least 100 yards away in the Paddock grandstand and Track Boxes, per eyewitness accounts. Eleven grandstand spectators were injured, and nine required hospitalization. As the front of Walther's car dug into the fence, the nose was also sheared off and Walther's legs were exposed. The car landed back on the racing surface upside-down, and spun wildly down the main stretch, spraying burning fuel in all directions. The spinning car was hit by at least two other cars, and a total of at least ten other cars became involved in the crash, including: Wally Dallenbach, Mike Hiss, Lee Kunzman, John Martin, David Hobbs, Mike Mosley, Jim McElreath and Dick Simon. Several cars were damaged extensively, and debris and burning fuel now littered the track. Kunzman later recalled that he thought he had been blinded by hitting the burning fuel until his car stopped and he flipped up his visor, as the intense heat had crinkled it so severely, he could not see where he was going.\nWalther's car came to rest upside-down near the pit exit. Walther suffered severe burns and injuries to his hands. Meanwhile, Bobby Unser had grabbed the race lead going into turn one, ahead of pole-sitter Johnny Rutherford. The race was immediately red-flagged, and the start was negated. The cars that had avoided the wreck parked at the head of the front stretch, and were eventually wheeled back to the pits. Safety crews attended to the crash scene, aided injured spectators, and also started repairing the catch fence and stanchions. The other drivers involved in the crash suffered only minor injuries (one report listed John Martin, Mike Hiss and Lee Kunzman as being treated for minor injuries at the track field hospital and released); Walther was transported to Methodist Hospital and remained hospitalized for months thereafter. Before all the cleanup and the repairs to the catchfence and two broken stanchions completed, rain began to fall again. The rest of the day was washed out, and officials rescheduled the start for 9:00 a.m. Tuesday.\nTuesday May 29.\nOn Tuesday May 29, the scheduled start time of the race was 9:00 a.m. At dawn, the skies were reported as clear, but soon after, rain fell in the morning hours, delaying any attempt to start until 10:15 a.m. Attendance was visibly down from Monday and estimated at 175,000–200,000.\nOfficials announced that the race would restart from scratch, and the single lap driven by some of the cars on Monday would not count in the scoring. Cars were gridded in their original starting positions, sans Walther, who was credited with 33rd place. All cars damaged in Monday's crash were allowed to make repairs, and Bob Harkey's team installed a new engine overnight.\nA heated pre-race meeting was held between the drivers and officials, and the subject of the crash and the speed of the pace car at the start was the focus. Drivers were complaining that the pace of the start () was too slow, and pointed to the ragged start of 1972 as well as reason to increase the pace car speed to .\nThe command to fire engines was given shortly after 10 o'clock, and the field of 32 cars pulled away for the warm-up laps. On the second parade lap, a light rain began to fall, and the track was red-flagged again. The cars were halted on the main stretch to wait out the shower. Rain continued to fall most of the day. Many fans headed for the exits, and eventually crews wheeled the cars back to the garage area yet again. During the delay, a pick-up soccer game broke out on the pit lane. At 1:48 p.m., the race was postponed until Wednesday.\nWednesday May 30.\nOn Wednesday, morning rain threatened to wash out the race for an unprecedented third day in a row. The start time was once again slated for 9:00 a.m., but again the participants and spectators had to wait. Estimates put the Wednesday attendance as low as 20,000, 35,000, or 50–60,000, and rain check tickets were no longer asked for at the gate. However, at least one estimate put the total attendance at 125,000 once the race got going. In addition since schools were closed on the west side of Indianapolis and in the town of Speedway due to traffic jams, school busloads of kids and parents were offered free rides to the Speedway to help fill the grandstands. After over two days of rainy revelry, the infield was overwhelmed with mud and garbage. The grandstands and bathrooms were littered with trash, and the walkways and grass parking lots were flooded. The infamous Snake Pit was described as a \"bog\". The health department overseeing the event even threatened to keep the race from running at all if it was rained out again on Wednesday, due to the deteriorating conditions of the infield.\nThe mood around the garage area was glum. Crews were exhausted, and drivers were apprehensive. It was now the longest rain delay in Indy 500 history to-date. Johnny Rutherford later quipped that if a poll had been taken around the garage area, the consensus would have been to leave and move on to the next race (Milwaukee). Media had already nicknamed the race the \"72 Hours of Indianapolis\", a play on the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The cars had sat mostly idle for the past nine days (except for the traditional Carburetion Day practice), raising separate concerns about potential mechanical and handling problems.\nThe delays at Indianapolis were beginning to have cascade effects on the schedule. Owing to the delay, USAC elected to postpone the next race of the season, the Rex Mays 150 at Milwaukee from June 3 to 10. Hotels, motels, and restaurants, as well as bus transit companies, airlines, and car rental companies were all jammed and some were overbooked. Local schools reported high absenteeism, and a handful of schools close to the track closed due to traffic congestion.\nAround midday, the sun finally came out for a few hours, and the track surface dried enough for a race start at 2:10 p.m.\nStart.\nOn the pace lap, the car of David Hobbs began smoking heavily. He pitted, and later rejoined the race. Bobby Unser took the lead at the start, and led the first 39 laps.\nThe first 56 laps were run with only two brief cautions, for only minor incidents. However, there was considerable attrition. Bobby Allison blew his engine at the completion of the first lap, Peter Revson brushed the wall in turn four on lap 3, and Mario Andretti broke a piston on lap 4.\nThe first yellow light came out on lap 17 when Bob Harkey's engine seized. It spilled oil, causing him to spin out and stall on the backstretch. Mark Donohue was the only one of the leaders that chose to pit during the yellow. Bobby Unser continued to lead, with Gordon Johncock running second, and Johnny Rutherford third. A. J. Foyt coasted to a stop in the pits after 37 laps with a broken rod bolt. Bobby Unser made his first pit stop on lap 40, briefly handing the lead to Johncock. Unser's pit stop dragged on for almost 45 seconds, and Swede Savage took over third.\nJohncock led laps 40–42, then made a pit stop. The lead was assumed by Swede Savage on lap 43, with Al Unser now second. Joe Leonard brought out the yellow for two minutes when he spun on lap 45 in the north chute between turns 3 and 4. Savage and Al Unser battled closely for several laps, with the lapped car of Roger McCluskey also in the mix. Unser was able to get by McCluskey on the backstretch on lap 53. He then made a slingshot pass around Savage for the lead going into turn one on lap 54.\nOn lap 55, Johnny Rutherford was given the black flag and went to the pits to check for leaking fluid. At the same time, Mark Donohue's car slowed and he went to the pits (and later dropped out) with a bad piston in what was his final 500.\nBy lap 57, only 22 cars of the starting field of 33 were on track.\nSwede Savage crash and death of Armando Teran.\nOn the 57th lap, Swede Savage made a pit stop. His car was filled with of methanol and fitted with a new right rear tire. On lap 59, Savage was in 2nd place, a few seconds behind race leader Al Unser. As Unser committed to a lap 59 pit stop ahead of him, Savage lost control of his car as he exited turn four. The car twitched back and forth, and then slid across to the inside of the track at nearly top speed. It hit the angled inside wall nearly head-on. The force of the impact, with the car carrying a full load of fuel in both tanks, caused the car to explode in a plume of flame. The force of the fuel exploding was so great that some structural rivets were blown rearward out of the car. The engine and transaxle tumbled end-over-end to the pit lane entrance while Savage, still strapped in his seat, was thrown back across the circuit. Savage came to rest adjacent to the outer retaining wall, fully conscious and completely exposed while he sat in a pool of flaming methanol fuel. The other cars on the track quickly stopped in turn four, as the track was completely blocked with debris and fire. A now third red flag was displayed at the flag stand which stopped the race at 3:05 p.m..\nTrack and safety crews immediately descended onto the crash scene to aid Savage. One fire truck, driven by fire/safety truck driver Jerry Flake, was signaled to head to the scene by Cleon Reynolds, the Chief of the Speedway Fire Department. Flake was stationed at the south end of the pits, and had to traverse the pit lane 'against traffic' to reach the Savage crash as quickly as possible. Driving a safety vehicle against the flow of racing and pit traffic was permissible in the USAC safety rules of 1973, and Reynolds' hand signal to Flake specifically instructed him to do exactly this. Flake reported \"laying on the horn\" and slow progress through the pit lane as people were in the way.\nAs Flake began speeding toward Savage's crash via the pit lane, numerous pit crew members from several teams moved to cross pit lane, toward the grass infield at trackside. Among those who did was George Bignotti, chief mechanic for Gordon Johncock, and 22-year-old Armando Teran, pit board man for Graham McRae. \"I had just crossed the lane\", Bignotti begins. Flake, driving northbound in pit lane at high speed, describes what he saw: \"All of a sudden things cleared up on the pit road and I had a clear shot all the way up to Savage's car which I could see burning. Then out of nowhere, a guy was in front of me...\"\nFlake's truck struck Teran, his body tossed about , an impact violent enough to knock him out of his shoes. As Bignotti relays it, \"I heard the car coming, and — whap — it hit him\". The incident was easily seen by thousands of spectators, as it occurred on the pit lane at the start/finish line. Teran suffered crushed ribs and a broken skull, and although he lived through the initial impact, he died shortly afterward after being transported to Methodist Hospital.\nIt was erroneously reported by media that Flake was at fault in the Teran collision because of driving against racing traffic; in 1973, safety trucks were permitted by USAC to drive in the opposite direction of the racing cars as Flake had done. The following year, USAC specifically prohibited safety trucks from driving in the opposite direction. For Teran's part, there was no rule forbidding him from leaving the pit wall, as a team's pit board, or \"chalkboard\" man, either.\nFinish.\nSavage was taken to the hospital with third degree burns and flame inhalation, but was in stable condition. After a red flag delay of about an hour and eleven minutes, the two crash scenes were cleared; the race resumed at 4:16 pm. After witnessing the Savage crash, a disconsolate George Snider decided to climb out of his car for the day. He turned it over to A. J. Foyt, his car owner. Foyt himself had already dropped out on lap 37, and was standing by in case he was needed for relief.\nThe race restarted on lap 61 with Al Unser leading, and attrition continued to take a toll on the field. On lap 73, Jimmy Caruthers blew his engine, and a connecting rod flew out, punctured, and violently blew his right front tire on the main stretch. He was able to maintain control of the car, and coasted around to the pit area. Al Unser's day ended with a blown engine on lap 75, and Gordon Johncock, another of Savage's Patrick Racing/STP teammates, assumed the lead.\nIn quick succession, seven cars dropped out between laps 91 and 101, including Bobby Unser, A. J. Foyt (in George Snider's car), and Dick Simon. The race finally reached the halfway point, and became official upon the completion of lap 101. By this time, only eleven cars were still running, just two on the lead lap. Gordon Johncock was leading and Bill Vukovich II had climbed all the way up to second position. Track officials began assembling victory lane, as dark skies were looming, evening was soon approaching, and they did not expect the race to go the full distance.\nJerry Karl, after about two hours of repairs in the pits, rejoined the race running over 100 laps down. He was able to move up to 26th place.\nOn the 129th lap a light rain began to fall, and the yellow light came on with Gordon Johncock leading. Only eleven cars were still on the track. After 133 laps, at about 5:30 p.m., the rain started to fall much harder, forcing the fourth and final red flag to come out. Although officials had not yet decided to call the race, it was obvious to everyone that the race was over; when the rain came, it was near-dusk, and the track was soon \"lost\" to the moisture, necessitating a lengthy drying period, which the remaining daylight would not provide. Johncock's Patrick Racing crew began to celebrate, along with a post-race winner's interview with a mostly despondent co-owner Andy Granatelli. Minutes after Granatelli's interview, officials declared the race complete, with Johncock the winner. Johncock led the most laps with a total of 64.\nPost-race.\nThe 1973 race was the shortest \"500\" on record at the time (), with the exception of the 1916 race, which was actually scheduled for . Three years later, the 1976 race was halted at an even shorter distance of , just past the halfway point when the race became official on lap 101.\nThe traditional victory banquet was canceled earlier in the day, and the victory lane celebration was fairly brief and muted. Johncock left the track soon after the race to visit Savage at the hospital, along with team owner Pat Patrick. Johncock and Patrick, and a few other crew members ended the day with a \"victory dinner\" which consisted of fast food hamburgers at the Burger Chef just east of the Speedway on Georgetown Road. BorgWarner gave Johncock a ceremony for his 1973 win in August 2021 at his forestry mill in South Branch, Michigan to celebrate his 85th birthday, with the trophy (riding in a Verizon 200 marked van) visiting landmarks in the city in addition to his forestry mill.\nThe Johncock family -- featuring Gordon, his wife Sue, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, along with surviving crew members of both the 1973 and 1982 wins, were given an official victory celebration for the 1973 win on April 24, 2023. The Speedway museum rolled out his 1982 race winner, and the family was given a tour of the oval on a Speedway bus. Following the museum tour, the formal victory banquet for the 1973 win was held at Binkley's Kitchen and Bar on North College Avenue in Indianapolis, where BorgWarner presented Gordon with the Champion Driver's Trophy, awarded to winners since 1988, and in more recent years given to drivers on milestone anniversaries of their race wins, and Sue a bouquet of flowers.\nAftermath.\nThe race and its safety concerns caused immediate uproar among racing owners, crew, and track owners. Two days after the race, team owner Andy Granatelli (whose car, driven by Johncock, won the race), declared that he would withdraw from USAC racing in 1974 unless changes were made. On June 2, Dr. Joseph Mattioli, owner of Pocono International Raceway, was calling for USAC to make changes \"(restricting) speeds of the race car so that we can once again have auto races that are competitive, exciting, and relatively safe\" for the next 500-mile race on the USAC schedule in early July.\nUSAC acted quickly. On the evening of June 2, 1973, the weekend after the race, USAC held an unscheduled meeting, revising rules. The large rear wings used in 1972–73 were cut back in size from , fuel tank capacity was drastically reduced from with the single tank mandated to be placed in the left sidepod, and the allowable fuel to be consumed in a 500-mile race was reduced from . Those changes were designed to slow the cars down. USAC also created a rule specifically disallowing the pit sign carrier from leaving his post as Teran did, for the duration of a race. (The pit signs have since been replaced by two-way radio communication, and after 2013 were prohibited during the race.) All of these rule changes were effective as of the Pocono 500 at Pocono Raceway to be held on July 1, 1973. USAC also delayed the Rex Mays 150 race in Milwaukee one week, to June 9–10, because of the lengthy delay in running the Indianapolis 500 race.\nOn July 2, 33 days after his on track injury, Swede Savage died in the hospital from complications arising from his injuries and treatment. The true cause of his death remains a point of dispute. It had been widely reported that Savage's death was caused by kidney failure, while others have said that Savage died from lung failure due to flame inhalation. Dr. Steve Olvey, Savage's attending physician (and later CART's director of medical affairs), claimed in his book \"Rapid Response\" that the real cause of death was complications related to contaminated plasma. Olvey claimed that Savage contracted hepatitis B from a transfusion, causing his liver to fail. According to Savage's father, the percentage of oxygen they were giving Swede just prior to his death, due to the damage to his lungs from the flames inhaled from the accident, was such that there was no way he could have survived, even if he had not contracted hepatitis B. Lung failure was repeated as the cause of death by Savage's daughter Angela in a May 2015 interview.\nAt the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, several safety changes were made for the 1974 race. The angled inside wall at the northwest corner of the track (which had also played a role in the Dave MacDonald/Eddie Sachs double-fatality in 1964) was removed, and the pit entrance was widened. Retaining walls were heightened and catch fences were improved around the track. A flag stand for the race starter and other officials was built over the outside wall of the track directly above the start-finish line (previously the starter was positioned down at the inside wall of the track itself). In addition, some spectator areas were moved back away from the track, and all of the rows of Track Box seats along the front stretch were removed. There was not another on-track fatality at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway until 1982 in which Gordon Smiley died in qualifying. Gordon Johncock also won that race.\nAs of 2023, Savage's death in 1973 is the last driver fatality at the Speedway that occurred as a result of a crash during the Indianapolis 500 itself, but the last fatality at the Speedway as a result of a race crash was a 2010 MotoGP support race where a 13-year old rider was killed on the formation lap.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer and Fred Agabashian served as \"driver expert\", replacing Len Sutton. Fred Agabashian returned after a six-year absence. The race was held over three days, and the network covered activities live on all three days.\nThis would be Mike Ahern's final race with the network crew. For 1973, the turn two reporting location was moved to the new VIP Suites, which had just been constructed. Bob Forbes served as wireless roving reporter, concentrating on the garage area.\nAt the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. The race was scheduled to air on Monday May 28 at 9 p.m. EDT for a two-hour same-day tape delay broadcast. However, the race suffered the crash of Salt Walther and rain prevented it from being restarted. The network showed a brief clip of Walther's crash, then filled the rest of the timeslot with a movie instead. On Tuesday May 29, the race was to be rescheduled for 9 a.m., but it was again rained out as well. On Wednesday May 30, the race was finally held, and ABC planned to air the broadcast in primetime on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. EDT. The broadcast featured a rebroadcast of Monday's aborted attempt at a start, as well as the conclusion on Wednesday.\nAnalyst Jackie Stewart was to be the color commentator, but was only able to be at the grounds on Monday and Tuesday as he left the Speedway Wednesday for Formula One commitments at the 1973 Monaco Grand Prix which he won. Chris Economaki substituted for Stewart in the booth on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Chris Schenkel rode and reported from inside the pace car.\nBecause of the long delay after Swede Savage's accident, some of the later portions of the race were still being edited as the beginning of the race was being broadcast.\nThe race was billed on ABC as \"Goodyear Presents the Indianapolis 500 Race\".\nThe broadcast re-aired on ESPN Classic for the first time on August 12, 2011. The broadcast was slightly edited from the original airing, as a scene in the immediate aftermath of Armando Teran's fatal accident was omitted (but is still available on YouTube). The broadcast was shown again on ESPN Classic on May 30, 2013 (the 40th anniversary).\nDocumentary films.\nSeveral documentary films were also produced discussing the 1973 Indianapolis 500. These include:\n\"The 200 MPH Barrier\", narrated by Ralph Camargo, Dynamic Films (for Ashland Oil)\n\"\", narrated by William Conrad (the 1973 Indianapolis 500 is one of the film's subjects)\n\"Fire and Rain\", for the STP-sponsored Patrick Racing teams (Johncock, McRae, Savage), Allend'or Productions\n\"The Longest May\", narrated by Tom Carnegie, McGraw-Hill productions\n\"The Indianapolis 500: The 70s\", narrated by Tom Carnegie (1973 was featured including interviews by the drivers who were there)"

        "text": "The 58th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 26, 1974. Johnny Rutherford, in his eleventh attempt, won the race from the 25th starting position, the farthest back since Louis Meyer in 1936. It was the first of his three Indy victories, and started a three-year stretch where he finished 1st-2nd-1st.\nThe race was run relatively clean, with no major crashes or injuries, a sharp contrast from the tragic 1973 event. In order to increase safety, significant improvements were made to the track and cars. Wings were reduced in size, fuel tank capacity was reduced, and pop-off valves were added to the turbocharger plenums in order to reduce horsepower and curtail speeds.\nFor the first time in Indy history, the race was scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. This ended the \"never on a Sunday\" policy previously held from 1911 to 1973. At the time, it was also the earliest calendar date (May 26) that the race had ever been held. With the implementation of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1971, the holiday was now observed on the last Monday of May (25–31), creating a three-day weekend (Saturday–Monday) every year.\nOn race day, A. J. Foyt broke the all-time record for most career starts at Indianapolis. The 1974 race was his 17th Indy 500 start (all consecutive), breaking the record of 16 previously held by Cliff Bergere and Chet Miller. Foyt would go on to start a total of 35 consecutive races (1958–1992), and as of 2023, still holds the record for most starts.\nBackground.\nSchedule changes.\nThe race was run in the wake of the energy crisis, which precipitated several changes to the schedule. During the offseason, government officials were pressuring sports and recreational organizations to curtail their energy consumption. Track management did not want to shorten the traditional 500-mile race distance, but agreed to voluntarily curtail other track activities. In the first half of 1974, NASCAR decided to trim all of their race distances by 10%, as well as scale back practice and ancillary events. Earlier in the year, the Daytona 500 was notably trimmed by 20 laps (the race officially started on lap 21), and the race ran a distance of only 450 miles. Furthermore, the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring were canceled outright.\nUSAC opted to cut a week of practice out of the schedule for the Indy 500. Previously, the track would open for practice on May 1 (or as early as the Saturday \"before\" May 1). For 1974, the track opened three weeks before the race. Time trials were cut back from four days to two. Pole day would be held on the Saturday two weeks before the race, and Bump Day would be held on the Saturday one week before the race.\nIn addition, the track would begin opening on practice days around 12 noon, rather than the previous 9 a.m. Normally, the first few hours of practice were quiet and leisurely with few cars taking advantage of the track time. Thus they were deemed superfluous and excessive on resources and operating costs. This change was also introduced because it made logical sense to have drivers practicing on the track at the same time of day as they would be running in time trials and the race itself (theoretically it would better mimic the conditions encountered on those days).\nThe reduced on-track time was seen as a way to reduce overall fuel consumption – fewer days that fans would drive their cars to the track – but a mostly insignificant reduction of the actual methanol fuel used by the race cars.\nSafety improvements.\nAfter the tragic 1973 race, several changes were made to the course, as well as the car rules. The pit lane was widened, and lengthened to the north by about 400 feet. In addition, the inside wall from turn 4 to the pit entrance, which had played a part in the fatal 1973 crash that killed Swede Savage and the 1964 crash that killed Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs, was moved in, which allowed cars to have a much easier entrance into the pit lane as asphalt replaced grass in that area. The heights of the inside and outside retaining walls were also raised and set at a uniform height, a second safety fence was added to the existing fencing throughout, and several rows of trackside seats on the main straightaway were removed.\nAlso part of the improvements were a new flagstand and officials' booth. Tom Binford, the new chief steward for 1974, requested the construction of an elevated booth, to be located on the outside of the track at the start/finish line. The flagging duties were moved to the new perch. Previously they were done from a small trackside platform on the inside grass along the pit lane, and prior to that, on the race track itself. Though flagman Pat Vidan did not particularly like the confines of the new flagstand (it constricted his grandiose waving style), the officials preferred their improved view of the track and the isolation the booth provided (previously the officials were stationed on the pit lane, in full ear of the often confrontational participants).\nJust three days after the 1973 race, USAC held an urgent meeting to draft emergency rule changes in time for the Pocono 500. Rear wings were reduced in size from 64 inches to 55 inches. On-board fuel capacity was reduced from down to , and fuel tanks were only allowed on the left side of the car, with the exception of a 2 gallon pick-up tank. An energy-absorbing material was to be placed in the spot formerly occupied by the right-side tank, and total fuel allotment for the 500 miles was reduced from 375 to 340 gallons. By May 1974, the rules were changed once more, further reducing the total fuel allotment to 280 gallons, and rear wings down to 43 inches.\nThree Time Formula One World Champion Jackie Stewart who was reporting for ABC Sports filmed a piece on improved safety and he said \"The cars wishing to enter the pitlane should continue though turn four low on the racetrack on the new black surface. I don't much like the idea of the infield to be used by emergency equipment to go in the opposite direction of the race cars themselves but of course these are ambulances and wreckers so it may have to happen. The pit lane has been extended by a full one and a half football fields in length, it's demarcation point is this structure. Now this I disapprove of because if a race car hit's this, it's going to be a horrible accident and I think it's unnecessary. The new pit lane operation however I think is going to be considerably safer and considerably better then what we ever seen at Indianapolis before.\" Stewart then question Binford about the changes saying \"I think they are two benefits that I could think of off hand, one of is that we can bring the pace car off sooner then [sic] we were able to do in the past, out and away from the field in the fourth turn.\"\nDuring time trials, all cars were required to carry a pop-off valve to control turbocharger \"boost.\" Maximum boost levels were set at 80 inHG. The reduction of boost, reduction of wing sizes, and other technical changes lowered speeds by about 8–10 mph from 1973. As a result, top speeds would be around 190 mph, and the elusive 200 mph barrier would be out-of-reach for 1974.\nRule changes.\nIn response to the fatal accident of pit crew member Armando Teran in 1973, safety trucks were prohibited from driving on the racing surface in the opposite direction of the racing cars. Teran was struck by a fire truck rushing to the scene of Swede Savage's accident.\nDuring time trials, a new safety rule was put into place to convey to the officials the start of a qualifying attempt. When a driver was on his three warm-up laps, a crew member(s) from his team was now stationed at the north end of the mainstretch, and provided with two flags (green and yellow). When the car came around after the third and final warm-up lap, the crew member was instructed to wave a green flag in the air to signify the driver will begin the run. If the crew waves a yellow flag, or waves no flag, the run does not start, the car returns to the pits, and the attempt does not count. As in previous years, each car was still permitted up to three official qualifying attempts.\nPreviously, the driver himself would make the decision on whether to start the qualifying run. He would do so by raising his hand in the air as he approached the start/finish line. Due to the significantly rising speeds, and the awkwardness of doing so in the increasingly confined cockpits, this practice was abandoned. For instance, during qualifying in 1970, Lloyd Ruby raised his hand to make his attempt, but officials did not see it, and inadvertently waved him off. After he persuaded the officials for a do-over, he burned a piston. It was also in the interest of safety, reflecting upon an incident that involved Bobby Grim during the 1959 race. Grim suffered magneto failure and began coasting to the pits. As was customary for drivers of the time, he raised his arm to signify to the other drivers he had lost power. However, due to the high speed he was still traveling, he painfully dislocated his arm in the process.\nThis new arrangement also made it simpler for the crew to \"wave off\" an unsatisfactory attempt already in progress. At any time during the four-lap run, if the crew was dissatisfied with the performance, they could wave a yellow flag, and officials would immediately abort the run. Crews could now wave off a run without needing input from, or conveying the message to, the driver out on the track. Previously the only way to wave off a run was to pull into the pits. Typically, crew members would use hand-held stopwatches and clock their car from a reference point in turn four. That would give them enough time to estimate their forthcoming lap time, and decide whether to abort the run before the car crossed the start/finish line. Furthermore, the rules made it clear that the instant the yellow flag was waved by the crew, the run was aborted, irrespective of the position of the car out on the track. If the car continued down the mainstretch, it would not matter if he/she proceeded to cross the finish line. Previously, if a car physically crossed the finish line, the run counted and was locked in, even if the team was intending to wave off the run. That situation made for some precarious maneuvers to the pit lane or to cars stopping out on the track to avoid crossing the finish line and 'locking in' the undesirable qualifying time.\nDeparture of Firestone.\nThe 1974 race would be the last, temporarily, for Firestone, who dropped out of Indy car competition effective at the end of the season. Firestone had been a fixture at the Indianapolis 500 dating back to 1911. Firestone-shod cars had won the Indianapolis 500 a total of 48 times to date, including the first race and 43 consecutive from 1920 to 1966. By the mid-1960s, Goodyear had joined the sport, and began a fiercely-competitive \"tire war\". Firestone had not won the 500 since Al Unser won back-to-back in 1970-1971. Starting in 1975, Goodyear became the lone tire supplier for Championship Car racing and the Indy 500 - an arrangement that would continue through 1994. Firestone made a heralded return to Indy car competition in 1995, and eventually became the exclusive tire supplier starting in 2000.\nTime trials.\nQualifying was scheduled for two days (Saturday May 11 &amp; Saturday May 18). Each day was slated to have two separate sessions, an early session from 11:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., followed by a late session from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The four total sessions were intended to mimic the traditional four days of time trials which had been scaled back for 1974 due to the energy crisis. The pole position was to be the fastest driver before 2:30 p.m. on the first day (May 11), or once the original qualifying draw had exhausted. Officials announced that the pole round would be extended beyond 2:30 p.m. only if all cars had not yet had their opportunity to make their allotted attempt. Qualifiers from the late session would line up behind the qualifiers from the early session, and so on.\nRain, however, threw a wrench into the plan on both days. Pole qualifying ended up stretching in to the second day. Once the pole round was finally completed, bump day qualifying immediately commenced, and the four sessions plan was scrapped.\nPole day.\nPole Day was scheduled for Saturday May 11. A. J. Foyt drew the first spot in the qualifying draw, and was the first car to make an attempt when the track opening at 11 a.m. His four-lap speed of 191.632 mph placed him tentatively on the pole position.\nWally Dallenbach completed a run of 189.683 mph, which put him in second starting position. His car featured a controversial \"king sized\" turbocharger, which some competitors complained was too large to be controlled by the standard issue pop-off valves. Ultimately, Dallenbach's blower was deemed legal, but USAC ruled that the team had to use the same turbo in the race. They would not be allowed to swap it out for the more fuel-conservative smaller turbo on race day.\nAt 12:25 p.m. rain halted qualifying. Only nine cars had completed an attempt.\nAt 3:35 p.m., the track was dried, and qualifying resumed. Five more cars were able to take to the track, but rain returned, and the track was closed for the day at 4:20 p.m. The field was only filled to 15 cars, and several drivers, including Mario Andretti and Gordon Johncock were still in line and eligible for the pole. Al Unser and Johnny Rutherford, however, both suffered blown engines during the day, and had to forfeit their spots in the qualifying line. Both would be ineligible for the pole, and would have to be second-day qualifiers.\nBump day.\nThe track opened for time trials on Saturday May 18 with eleven cars still eligible for the pole position round. Gordon Johncock was the first driver out, and he completed a run of 186.287 mph. The next car out was Mike Hiss, who qualified third at 187.490 mph. Andretti was the last driver who was a factor for the pole, but he ended up fifth. At 12:30 p.m., the pole round was officially over, with A. J. Foyt holding on to the pole position. The field officially was filled to 24 cars. As soon as the pole round had concluded, rain fell, closing the track for almost four hours.\nAt 4:20 p.m., the track was dried and re-opened for Bump Day time trials. Rutherford, who missed out on the pole round, qualified at 190.446 mph, the second-fastest car in the field. Since he was a second day qualifier, however, he was forced to line up behind the first-day qualifiers in 25th position.\nWith fifteen minutes left in the day, the field was filled to 33 cars. Johnny Parsons bumped Jigger Sirois out of the field with nine minutes left. The final car to make an attempt was rookie Jan Opperman, who qualified for the 32nd position, bumping Denny Zimmerman. Sammy Sessions and others were left waiting in line at the 6 o'clock gun. A protest was filed by owners representing nine cars that were not able to make an attempt (mostly due to the numerous rain delays), but it was dismissed.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nAt the start, Wally Dallenbach blasted from the middle of the front row to take the lead into turn one. His aforementioned \"king-sized\" turbocharger was credited for the fast start, but its reliability was a source of considerable concern. Dallenbach set a new race record for one-lap of 191.408 mph on lap 2, as he pulled out to a sizable lead. The lead was short-lived, however, as Dallenbach broke a piston and coasted to a stop on lap 3. Attrition was very high early on, as eight cars dropped out with mechanical problems by lap 11. Mario Andretti and Gary Bettenhausen each broke a valve, and Mike Mosley blew an engine. Rick Muther pulled into the pits with problems during the pace lap, but rejoined the race, only to lose a piston after 11 laps.\nA. J. Foyt took the lead when Dallenbach dropped out. Rutherford was charging dramatically from the 25th starting position. By lap 23, he was running third, and on lap 24, he passed Bobby Unser to take 2nd position.\nFirst half.\nThe top five consisted of Foyt, Rutherford, Bobby Unser, rookie Tom Sneva and Al Unser. By lap 45, Rutherford was driving very aggressively in traffic, and caught up to Foyt. The two cars ran nose-to-tail over the next several laps.\nDuring the second sequence of pit stops around lap 50, teammates Gordon Johncock and Steve Krisiloff both ran out of fuel. They coasted back to the pits and lost considerable time on the track. Bobby Unser also ran out of fuel, and top of that, had a 39 second pit stop. On lap 62, the first caution came out when Larry Cannon stalled on the backstretch. Under the yellow, A. J. Foyt had a terrible pit stop of 53 seconds, which allowed Rutherford to take the lead for the first time on lap 65.\nThe green came out on lap 68, but only lasted three laps, as Jimmy Caruthers blew an engine, and dropped oil on the track. Five laps later, Pancho Carter lightly brushed the wall exiting turn four, but the car did not suffer significant damage.\nOn the next green flag pit stop around lap 90, Rutherford was on the receiving end of good luck. He ducked into the pits under green, but seconds later the caution came out for a spin by Jan Opperman, which allowed Rutherford to pit with little time lost.\nSecond half.\nJerry Karl crashed in turn 3 after completing 115 laps. During the caution, Johnny Rutherford exited the pits right in front of second place A. J. Foyt, and held the lead. Seconds later, the green light came back on while the drivers were in the southchute. Foyt got the jump on the restart, and passed Rutherford for the lead in turn 2.\nAt lap 130, Foyt, Rutherford, and Bobby Unser were running 1st-2nd-3rd. Al Unser dropped out on lap 131 with a broken valve, bringing out the caution for a tow-in. Foyt ducked into the pits, and Rutherford was now the leader again.\nOn lap 138, the green light came back on. Foyt came through traffic and passed Rutherford for the lead down the mainstretch. A lap later though, Foyt's car began smoking, and he was issued the black flag due to leaking oil. After two pit stops, Foyt dropped out with a broken turbocharger scavenger pump.\nRutherford took over the lead on lap 141, and seemed to have the race in hand. Bobby Unser was the only other car on the lead lap, but was between 15-20 second behind. Rutherford had a close call in turn one while attempting to pass lap traffic. As he was lapping Pancho Carter and Jim McElreath, Carter spun right next to him in turn one. McElreath narrowly avoided him, and all three cars continued.\nRutherford gave up the lead only one more time on lap 176 during a pit stop. He led the final 24 laps to win his first Indianapolis 500. David Hobbs' 5th-place finish was the only top ten at Indianapolis for a foreign driver in the 1970s (except Andretti, who was born in Italy but was a naturalized U.S. citizen).\nImmediately after the checkered flag was waved for Johnny Rutherford, a multitude of fans streamed onto the active track in turn 3. This forced the race steward to immediately halt the race, rather than give lapped drivers five extra minutes to complete the race distance as had been the custom since 1964 (before 1964, the time allowed was even longer). The fan incursion caused the Indianapolis 500 race rules to be changed for 1975 and beyond, so that the winner crossing the line ends the race, and all competitors behind the race winner are allowed only to finish their current running lap under green.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. The broadcast reached an estimated 1,200 affiliates and carriers. Sid Collins served as chief announcer and Fred Agabashian served as \"driver expert.\" At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. The broadcast opened with a 45-minute prerace.\nSeveral shuffles occurred amongst the reporters and locations, the most significant changes in almost a decade. Mike Ahern retired from the crew and his prestigious turn one location. Veteran Ron Carrell moved from turn three to take over turn one. Among the newcomers was Paul Page, who debuted as a pit reporter. The reporting location for turn three was moved to a platform on the \"L\" grandstand. Doug Zink took over turn three, and rookie Jerry Baker made his 500 radio debut on the backstretch.\nFor the first time, there were five pit/garage reporters on the crew. For the 1974 race, the length of the pit road was increased, and the additional reporter was added to help cover the expansion. Bob Forbes was once again the \"wireless\" roving reporter.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. Jim McKay returned as announcer, but Jackie Stewart was in Monaco for coverage of the grand prix but Stewart recorded features during the qualifying weekends before he went to Monaco and the features were aired on race day before sending a report from Monaco of the race. Former driver Sam Posey joined the crew as booth analyst.\nThe broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic since May 2011.\nSince April 25, 2019 the full race broadcast was made available on the official Indianapolis Motor Speedway YouTube channel."

        "text": "The 59th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 25, 1975. A. J. Foyt started on the pole position and Bobby Unser won his second Indianapolis 500. Dan Gurney, one of the founders of All American Racers, who finished second as a driver himself in 1968–1969, won his first and only Indy 500 as a car owner. Gurney's Eagle chassis itself scored its third \"500\" win. The race was part of the 1975 USAC National Championship Trail.\nOn the 174th lap (435 miles), a heavy downpour pelted the Speedway, and officials immediately ended the race, just 26 laps short of the scheduled distance. Bobby Unser was leading the race at the red flag, and was declared the winner. Defending champion Johnny Rutherford was in second place, and pole-sitter A. J. Foyt came home third.\nTom Sneva survived a spectacular crash in turn two on lap 125. His car touched wheels with the car of Eldon Rasmussen, and flipped into the catch fence near the Turn Two Suites. The engine on Sneva's car ripped off in a huge fire-flash, and the car came to rest upright with Sneva trapped in the cockpit. Sneva miraculously suffered only minor injuries, and walked away from the wreck with assistance from the safety crews.\nOn the morning of the race, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was ceremoniously designated to the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, the Hulman family celebrated thirty years of ownership of the facility.\nRace schedule.\nA year earlier (1974), the race was held in the wake of the energy crisis. USAC cut out a week of practice, and trimmed time trials from four days to two days, in order to reduce energy consumption. These changes were well received by competitors and fans, and USAC decided to make the reduction of practice time permanent; however, time trials were restored back to four days for 1975 and beyond.\nTime trials.\nFor the second year in a row, turbocharger \"boost\" levels were set at 80 inHG maximum. Once again, top speeds would be in the low to mid-190 mph range, and would not challenge the track record.\nOn Thursday May 8, Gordon Johncock showed himself as a favorite for the pole, completing a practice lap at 195.228 mph. Johncock consistently led the speed charts on four of the practice days. A. J. Foyt was close behind, topping the speed chart twice.\nPole Day – Saturday May 10.\nPole day dawned sunny and mild. Rookie Al Loquasto was the first driver out to qualify. Mike Mosley (187.833 mph) led the speeds early on, and was the fastest car through the first hour. At 12:15 p.m., Tom Sneva (190.094 mph) moved into the top spot.\nAbout an hour later, Bobby Unser took to the track, and at 191.073 mph, bumped Sneva off the pole spot. Unser's speed did not last long, as Gordon Johncock, the next car out, then took over the provisional pole at 191.652 mph. The track remained mostly quiet over the next three hours, as drivers waited for cooler conditions.\nShortly after 4 p.m., the track action ramped up once again. A. J. Foyt blistered the track, with his first lap coming in at 195.313 mph. His four-lap average of 193.975 mph secured the pole position.\nThe final qualifying attempt of the afternoon was put in by Bill Puterbaugh. After six years of failure, Puterbaugh finally qualified for his first Indy 500. He pumped his fist as he returned to the pits, putting in the 15th-fastest speed of the day.\nThe day closed with the field filled to 22 cars. With Foyt, Johncock, and Bobby Unser qualifying 1-2-3, it was the first time in Indy history that former winners swept the front row.\nSecond Day – Sunday May 11.\nAfter blowing his engine the day before, Wally Dallenbach returned to the track and qualified. His speed of 190.646 mph was the 4th-fastest overall, but as a second day qualifier, he would be forced to line up 21st.\nA total of six cars qualified, and at the close of the first weekend of time trials, the field was filled to 28 cars.\nThird Day – Saturday May 17.\nWith five spots open in the field, qualifying opened with Mike Hiss the first car to make an attempt. The field was quickly filled to 33 cars, and Lee Kunzman was the first car on the bubble.\nMario Andretti returned from Monaco, and put his car solidly in the field with a speed of 186.480 mph, easily the fastest driver of the day, bumping Kunzman in the process. At 12:18 p.m., Al Loquasto was now on the bubble.\nBilly Scott made two attempts to bump his way in, but blew his engine on the first attempt, and waved off the second. No other cars made an attempt the rest of the day.\nBump Day – Sunday May 18.\nOn the final day of time trials, Al Loquasto still clung to the bubble spot. Eldon Rasmussen was the first car out to make an attempt. His first lap was over 183 mph, but the next two laps dropped off and the team waved off the run. Three hours later, Jim Hurtubise blew an engine after one slow lap, and Loquasto was still on the bubble after over 24 hours.\nWith about an hour left in the day, Loquasto survived yet two more attempts. At 5:18 p.m., with just under 42 minutes left in the day, Eldon Rasmussen made his second attempt. His speed of 181.910 mph bumped Loquasto and the field was set.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nGordon Johncock took the lead at the start and led the first 8 laps. But Johncock dropped out on lap 11 with an ignition failure. Also out early were Salt Walther (his Indy record third last place finish), and Lloyd Ruby, both out with engine problems.\nPolesitter A. J. Foyt took the lead on lap 9. He briefly lost the lead for three laps during a pit stop on lap 22, but re-assumed the lead on lap 25, and led through lap 58. Salt Walther, who had dropped out, summoned his teammate Bob Harkey to the pits on lap 18. Walther climbed in the car and took over the machine for the remainder of the race. While the driver switch was apparently agreed upon before the race if the circumstances arose, Walther was criticized for making the switch under green, and not waiting for a caution period. The Harkey/Walther car fell a few laps down during the stop.\nFirst half.\nThe first yellow came out on lap 45 for Mike Hiss, who went high and brushed the wall in turn three.\nDuring his first scheduled pit stop, Mario Andretti's car stalled several times trying to leave the pit lane. He lost several laps, but eventually rejoined the race. On the leaders' lap 68, Andretti spun out on the backstretch, and slammed into the inside wall near the entrance to turn three. He was out of the race after completing only 49 laps.\nWally Dallenbach took the lead for the first time on lap 59. He would lead a total of 96 laps, giving up the lead only during pit stops.\nNASCAR regular Bobby Allison managed to lead one lap during a pit stop shuffle, in what would be his final start at Indy. Allison had decided to skip the World 600 at Charlotte and was the final noteworthy \"cross over\" driver to the Indy 500 during that era.\nOn the 73rd lap, A. J. Foyt passed Cliff Bergere (2,425) for first place all-time in total laps completed at the Indy 500.\nSecond half.\nDuring a sequence of green flag pit stops, A. J. Foyt appeared to run out of fuel going into turn 1. Coasting down the backstretch, seemingly without power, it appeared that Foyt was fiddling with his headrest or something behind the cockpit. Seconds later, he was back up to speed, and made it to the pits for fuel.\nOn lap 125, Tom Sneva approached the lapped car of Eldon Rasmussen in turn 1. As the two cars went side-by-side in turn two, they touched wheels and Sneva's car flipped up into a huge wreck. Sneva did a barrel-roll over the front nose of Rasmussen's car, becoming completely airborne and upside-down. The car rolled upright, and hit the outside wall and catch fence with the back end. The engine, gearbox, and rear of the car were ripped from the chassis, leaving a huge fire flash as the fuel and oil ignited in front of the Turn Two Suites. The cockpit section continued down the track, flipping at least twice, and came to rest on the track, right side up, then spun for several yards, coming to rest facing backwards. The engine and other parts scattered in different directions, and littered the track with debris bringing out the caution.\nSneva was conscious when the car came to rest, and immediately started unbuckling his seat belts trying to get out. The back of the car was still on fire, and he unknowingly lifted his visor, which singed his face with burns. He then put his hand down in a pool of methanol, which burned his fingers. His legs were trapped in the cockpit, and he was not able to get out of the car on his own. Rescue workers immediately arrived at the scene, and put out the remaining fires. A moment later, he was pulled from the wreck, and with assistance, walked to the ambulance.\nSneva did not suffer any serious bodily injuries, but was listed in serious condition with burns to his face and hands. After a couple days, Sneva's condition was quickly upgraded, and after a month, he was back racing.\nAfter leading 96 laps, Wally Dallenbach dropped out with a blown piston on lap 162. That handed the lead to Johnny Rutherford, with Bobby Unser now in second.\nBobby Unser took the lead on lap 165. The skies were threatening, and rain was expected to move into the vicinity of the Speedway.\nFinish.\nOn lap 170, Gary Bettenhausen's right rear hub exploded and he lost the wheel down the mainstretch. Precariously riding on three wheels, he skillfully managed to keep the car mostly off the wall, and was able to park the car down in the infield of turn one. The caution light came on for the debris, and leader Bobby Unser ducked into the pits for a quick stop (fuel only). Second place Johnny Rutherford also made a pit stop. A minor fire broke out in Dick Simon's pit, but it was quickly doused.\nUnder the yellow, the skies became increasingly dark, and the rain that had been threatening finally was about to arrive.\nBobby Unser suddenly ducked into the pits for a second \"splash-and-go\" pit stop, topping off the tank in just 6 seconds. Unser's pit stop allowed third place A. J. Foyt to unlap himself back onto the lead lap. One lap later, the skies opened up, and it began to pour rain. It was lap 174 and Bobby Unser was leading, with Johnny Rutherford about a half lap behind in second. The track became flooded and many of the cars began hydroplaning and spinning out of control. The visibility dropped to near zero, as the heavy rain and the \"rooster tails\" made it difficult for the drivers to see. Fans began scurrying for cover. Bill Vukovich II's car skidded in turn 4, slid backwards to the inside of the turn and backed into the fencing, narrowly missing a spectator, but Vukovich somehow managed to get it back under control.\nStarter Pat Vidan took out the red and checkered flag, and the race was halted plus declared complete. The leaders had to precariously coast around to the finish line. Despite several wrecked cars blocking the track, Unser, Rutherford, and Foyt all managed to make it to the finish line cleanly. The race was officially called with Unser completing 174 laps (435 miles), just 26 laps short of the scheduled distance. Defending champion Johnny Rutherford followed with a second place, and pole-sitter Foyt finished third, still looking for the elusive fourth Indy win.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. The broadcast crew was largely familiar from 1974. The broadcast was carried on 1,200 affiliates including shortwave transmissions via AFN to Europe, Asia, Thailand, and many other locales. It was heard by over 100 million listeners worldwide. Collins had no celebrity guests in the booth during the race. But during the pre-race coverage, Collins interviewed Senator Barry Goldwater as well as Pete DePaolo, who was celebrating fifty years since his victory in 1925.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. Longtime Indy fixture Jim McKay sat out the broadcast for one year and was replaced by announcer Keith Jackson. McKay was sent on other assignments in the 1975 season, including the 1975 Monaco Grand Prix. Jackie Stewart returned to serve as analyst after missing the 1974 race. Stewart covered both Monaco and Indianapolis. Sam Posey, who served as analyst in 1974, was moved to the pit area.\nThe broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic since May 2011."

        "title": "1976 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 60th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 30, 1976. Polesitter Johnny Rutherford took the lead on lap 80, and was leading when rain halted the race on lap 103. Two hours later, the race was about to be resumed, but rain fell again. USAC officials called the race at that point, reverted the scoring back to the completion of lap 102, and Johnny Rutherford was declared the winner. Rutherford famously walked to Victory Lane, his second career Indy 500 triumph, having completed only , the shortest official race on record. Janet Guthrie became the first female driver to enter the Indianapolis 500. However, her team was underfunded, and she experienced numerous mechanical and engine problems during the month. While she managed to pass her rookie test, and ran numerous practice laps in multiple cars, she was unable to make an attempt to qualify. She would return with a successful effort a year later in 1977.\nHours after the race, IMS Vice President Elmer George was shot and killed during a confrontation. He had been in charge of the IMS Radio Network and was the son-in-law of IMS owner Tony Hulman. The confrontation was unrelated to the running of the race. In addition, 1976 would be the final Indy 500 for longtime radio anchor Sid Collins. After a surgery to repair a disk in his neck, Collins was still suffering muscular and neurological ailments, which made his work at the 1976 race physically difficult. He was later diagnosed with ALS, and committed suicide on May 2, 1977.\nRutherford's victory would be the final win at Indy for the venerable Offenhauser engine. It was the beginning of the end of an era which had seen 27 Indy 500 victories for the Offy powerplant.\nThe month of May 1976 was highlighted by the grand opening of the new Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. Located in the track infield, the new museum replaced a much smaller facility on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road. It was also the 30th anniversary of the first 500 under Tony Hulman's ownership, the 50th year since the incorporation of the Town of Speedway, and coincided with the year-long United States Bicentennial celebration.\nRace schedule.\nOn May 2, six days before the race cars took to the track, former Governor of California Ronald Reagan visited the Speedway. Reagan was in town campaigning for the 1976 Indiana Republican primary to be held on May 4. Reagan met with Tony Hulman, toured the Speedway, and drove around the track in one of the Buick pace cars.\nPractice and time trials.\nThe biggest story of practice was the appearance of Janet Guthrie, who was attempting to become the first female driver to qualify for the Indianapolis 500. Considerable media attention followed her through the month, however, the first two weeks of practice were plagued with various troubles. In addition, her participation was met with resistance by some fellow competitors. Upon her arrival at the airport, her flight lost her luggage (which included her helmet and driving suit). On the first day of practice, teammate Dick Simon was shaking the car down, but suffered an oil leak. On the second day, he burned a piston and had a turbocharger fire. Guthrie was unable to take to the track until Monday. Her first foray in the machine was short-lived, as she too burned a piston after only seven laps at speed.\nOn Tuesday, Guthrie started her rookie test, and despite low oil pressure and overheating, she made it through the first phase. On Thursday, she was trying to finish the second phase, but rain cut the run short. She finally completed her rookie test on Monday May 17, with a top lap of 171.429 mph.\nPractice for the veterans was led by Johnny Rutherford, Al Unser and A. J. Foyt. In the third year of a rules package crafted to slow the cars down, there were no expectations of record speeds for 1976. Top speeds were in the high 180 mph range, with the best lap (189.833 mph) going to Rutherford. The existing track record (set in 1973) of 199.071 mph would stand for yet another year.\nThe most serious crash of practice was that of rookie Eddie Miller. He lost control coming out of turn one, and spun to the inside. The car hit an earth embankment, flipped over wildly, cleared two fences, then came to rest upside-down near the bleachers. Miller suffered a neck fracture, and would never return to Indy.\nPole day – Saturday May 15.\nOvernight rain delayed the start of time trials until 2:30 p.m. During practice, Johnny Rutherford finally broke the 190 mph barrier for the month, making him the favorite for the pole position.\nAt 3:30 p.m., Gordon Johncock (188.531 mph) put himself tentatively on the pole, and his speed would comfortably put him on the front row. About an hour later, Johnny Rutherford (188.957 mph) bumped Johncock off the top spot and would hold on to win the pole position. A. J. Foyt settled for fifth (185.261 mph), and Tom Sneva (186.355 mph) qualified for the outside of the front row.\nQualifying closed at 6 p.m. with nine cars in the field. Five drivers were still eligible for the pole round, however, none of those left in line were considered a contender for the pole. The day closed with the front row consisting of Rutherford, Johncock, and Sneva. \nSecond day – Sunday May 16.\nOnly two cars that were eligible for the pole round made runs, and the field was filled to 11 cars. Moments later, the \"second day\" of time trials officially commenced. Mario Andretti, who had left Indianapolis to compete in the Belgian Grand Prix, dropped out of that race. Andretti would be back at the track soon, planning to put a car in the field on the second weekend of time trials.\nMike Mosley (187.588 mph) and Bobby Unser (187.520 mph) were the quickest of the day, but as \"second day\" qualifiers, they lined up 12th and 13th, respectively.\nThird day – Saturday May 22.\nMario Andretti returned to Indianapolis after competing in the Belgian Grand Prix. Andretti was expected to get up to speed quickly, and did not disappoint. His qualifying speed of 189.404 mph was faster than the pole speed, and Andretti became the fastest qualifier in the field. However, since he was a \"third day\" qualifier, he was forced to line up behind the previous days' qualifiers. On race day, he would start in 19th position.\nA busy day of time trials saw the field filled to 33 cars at 5:37 p.m. The day ended with two cars bumped, and at least five drivers looking to make the field on Bump day.\nAmong those who did not make an attempt yet was Janet Guthrie. Still having problems finding speed in her #27 entry, her best practice lap of 173.611 mph was still too slow to bump her way in. A rumor was already circulating around the garage area that Foyt was going to lend her one of his backup cars (#1) – a car in which he practiced at over 190 mph on Friday.\nBump Day – Sunday May 23.\nThe story of the day was Janet Guthrie, who arranged a deal with A. J. Foyt to borrow his #1 entry for practice. Shortly after 10 a.m., Guthrie was in the car shaking it down. Her lap of 180.796 mph was easily her fastest lap of the month. Despite her considerable gains in speed, Guthrie did not end up making an attempt to qualify.\nAs the afternoon was winding down, the attention shifted to the cars trying to bump their way into the field in the final hour. David Hobbs bumped his way in at 4:55 p.m. Eldon Rasmussen was now on the bubble. Rasmussen survived three attempts, but at 5:59 p.m., Jan Opperman took to the track. Opperman's run of 181.717 mph bumped Rasmussen from the field, and the lineup was set.\nAfter creating a media and fan frenzy, Janet Guthrie left the track without making the field. With the spotlight still on her, she quickly found herself an alternative. Promoter Humpy Wheeler consummated a deal for Guthrie to acquire a car from NASCAR owner Ralph Moody, and within 48 hours, flew her to Charlotte to qualify instead for the World 600.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nRace day dawned with blue skies and temperatures in the 60s. Rain was in the forecast for later in the afternoon. Tony Hulman gave the command to start engines at 10:53 a.m. EST, and the field pulled away for one parade lap and one pace lap. Country singer, and part-time NASCAR driver Marty Robbins drove the Buick pace car.\nAt the start, polesitter Johnny Rutherford took the lead into turn one, and led the first three laps. A. J. Foyt moved up to second, then passed Rutherford for the lead on lap 4. Back in the pack, Mario Andretti charged quickly from 19th starting position to 7th in two laps.\nMoments later, Dick Simon blew an engine and stalled on the backstretch, bringing out the first caution. By lap ten, Simon, Spike Gehlhausen, Bill Vukovich II, and David Hobbs were all out of the race early with engine-related problems.\nThe green came back out on lap 7 with Foyt leading. On lap 10, Roger McCluskey lost control in turn three, hit the outside wall, then spun to the infield grass. Several leaders pitted under the caution. At lap 10, the top five was Foyt, Rutherford, Johncock, Sneva, and Dallenbach. A. J. Foyt was among those who went to the pits. As he pulled away, he snagged the crewman's wing adjuster, and he drove away with the long extension wrench still attached. Foyt was about to be black-flagged, but the adjuster fell off harmlessly. The debris lengthened the yellow light period for an additional three laps.\nFirst half.\nGordon Johncock took over the lead on lap 20, following Foyt's mishap. Johnny Rutherford ran second, and Foyt had dropped to third.\nAt lap 50, Johnny Rutherford was now leading, with Foyt second, and Johncock fading to third. Pancho Carter and Wally Dallenbach were running in the top five, with Tom Sneva close behind. Also climbing into the top ten was Salt Walther, in his best run at Indy thus far.\nAfter running in the top ten early on, Gary Bettenhausen dropped out on lap 52 with a broken turbo wastegate.\nJohnny Parsons lost a right front wheel on lap 60, bringing out the yellow. Rutherford had already made a pit stop, while Foyt had not. Foyt was able to pit under the caution, and gained enough track position to take the lead for the restart on lap 65. This was ultimately to set the tone of the race, which ultimately became a \"Texas shootout\" between Dallas native Rutherford, and Houston native Foyt.\nFoyt led Rutherford by about 9.5 seconds on lap 70. At that point, Rutherford began to close the gap. The sky was darkening, and rain was being reported in nearby Brownsburg. Rutherford charged to take the lead on lap 80, and began to pull away. At the same time, Foyt was beginning to suffer from handling problems.\nJerry Grant ran out of fuel on lap 91, bringing out the yellow. The green came back out on lap 95 with Rutherford first and Foyt second. Rain was quickly approaching. The yellow came out for drizzle on lap 100. On lap 103, the rain began to fall harder, and the red flag was displayed, halting the race. The race was stopped at approximately 12:42 p.m. local time.\nRain delay.\nThe cars were parked in the pits and covered with tarps, with Rutherford leading and Foyt second. In order for the race to be ruled official, it had to complete one lap beyond the halfway point (101 laps). Since the race was on lap 103, it could be deemed official, and if the rains continued the rest of the afternoon, USAC could call the race at that point.\nSince it was only 12:45 p.m., and with 97 laps still remaining, officials decided not to call the race prematurely. However, they did begin assembling the Victory Lane platform. By 1:15 p.m., it appeared that the rain had stopped, and track drying efforts were underway in earnest. About a half hour later, some light rain began to fall again.\nUnder the red flag, A. J. Foyt's team discovered a broken anti-roll bar linkage, and were able to make repairs. The team expected the car's handling to improve if and when the race was resumed.\nAt about 2:15 p.m., the rain had stopped, and the sun was shining through the clouds. With safety trucks and a jet dryer circulating, the track was almost dry. At 2:45 p.m., chief steward Tom Binford announced that the race will resume in about twenty minutes, and the focus shifted to the restart procedure. The decision was made to restart the race in single file, and give the field three or four warm up laps.\nAt 3:00 p.m. the call was made for the cars to line up in the grid, anticipating a restart. Some drivers began climbing into their machines.\nFinish.\nWith the cars lining up in the pit lane for a restart, observers around the circuit reported a dry track, but intermittent rain drops were falling at various locations. Some drivers were already in their cockpits. Soon after, umbrellas started opening up, and the rain began to fall harder around the track. Some fans began to look for cover, and the crews quickly covered up the cars again with tarps.\nAt roughly 3:15 p.m., the rain was falling harder, and the officials decided that the track was \"lost.\" They judged there was not sufficient time left in the day to wait out the shower, dry the track once again, and complete the final 97 laps. At that time, they declared the race official. The scoring was reverted to the completion of lap 102, and Johnny Rutherford was declared the winner.\nBefore his crew was able to wheel the car to Victory Lane, Johnny Rutherford was surrounded by media and reporters, and famously walked to Victory Lane.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nLegacy.\nRutherford capped off a three-year stint with finishes of 1st-2nd-1st from 1974 to 1976, tied for the best three-year span in Indy history. It was equaled by Wilbur Shaw in 1937–1940 (1st–2nd–1st–1st), Al Unser in 1970–1972 (1st–1st–2nd) and by Hélio Castroneves in 2001–2003 (1st–1st–2nd).\nAs of 2023, the 1976 race is the shortest Indy 500 on record, completing only 102 laps (255 miles) out of the scheduled 200 laps. By USAC rule, the race was required to complete 101 laps – one lap \"beyond\" the halfway point – to be considered official and full points, unlike most motorsport that use a rule under the FIA Code requiring just three green flag laps for an official race with a percentage of points on a sliding scale with three-fourths distance required for full points. It is also regarded as the \"shortest\" 500 mile race in a major U.S. series. Among other rain-shortened 500-mile races, the 1980 CRC Chemicals Rebel 500 that was the 105th and final win by David Pearson went 189 laps (258.67 miles) because of darkness after a weather delay caused by rain and hail lasting more than two-hours on Lap 106 of 367, and NASCAR attempted to restart the race with only one hour before sunset in order to reach the minimum distance, the only other 500 mile race that ran less than 260 miles. \nAt one lap beyond official rate status, a 2002 NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Darlington Raceway is the shortest race with similar rules. The 147-lap, 200.8 mile race won by Jeff Burton in August 2002 ran only to the minimum -- 74 laps. There have been a NASCAR Xfinity Series and Craftsman Truck Series race each that have ended at less than half distance, but declared official because both points-paying interval laps were completed -- Sheldon Creed's 2020 win at Kentucky Speedway, which was flagged for lightning after two 35-lap stages were completed of the 150-lap race, and Noah Gragson's 2022 Kansas Speedway win, which ended because of rain after two 45-lap stages of the 200-lap race were completed, \nThe 1976 race was the third race in four years (1973, 1975, 1976) to end rain-shortened. There would not be another rain-shortened Indy 500 until 2004. Rutherford's win from the pole was also somewhat trend-setting - only three other drivers had done so in the previous 22 years. In the next six years, the polesitter would finish either 1st or 2nd.\nThis was also the final 500 victory for the four-cylinder Offenhauser engine. Starting in 1977, the V-8 engines (from both Cosworth and Foyt) would start to make the four cylinder engine obsolete. 1980 was the real last hurrah for the engine, as the DGS version placed third with Gary Bettenhausen. No four-cylinder engine would qualify for the race beginning in 1981.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. The network celebrated its 25th anniversary. Sid Collins served as chief announcer for the 25th time. Unbeknownst to all involved, 1976 would be the final Indy 500 for Collins. After a surgery to repair a disk in his neck, Collins was still suffering muscular and neurological ailments, which made his work at the 1976 race physically difficult. He was later diagnosed with ALS, and committed suicide on May 3, 1977.\nThis would be the third and final time Paul Page reported from the pit area. The following year he would be elevated to the chief announcer position. In addition, third-year veteran Jerry Baker would report from the backstretch for the final time, starting in 1977 he was a pit reporter. Bob Forbes served as the wireless roving reporter in the garages. The broadcast reached over 1,200 affiliates, including foreign language translations into Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. It was picked up by Armed Forces Radio, and also transmitted to Japan, Central America and South America.\nCollins customarily ended his broadcasts with \"words of wisdom\", vignettes, or a set-piece monologue for the listeners. His final broadcast was closed with the following sign-off quote:\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. Jim McKay returned to anchor the broadcast, after sitting out the 1975 race. Analyst Jackie Stewart was absent from the broadcast, as he was in Monte Carlo for coverage of the Monaco Grand Prix, to be aired on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" the following weekend. Stewart, however, did record interviews during the month that aired during the Indy 500 broadcast. Stewart was paired with Keith Jackson at Monaco, the same pairing that had called the previous year's \"500\" on ABC in 1975. Former driver Sam Posey joined McKay at Indianapolis, his second time on the crew as booth analyst, and third year overall.\n\"Heavy Action\" was used in an \"Indianapolis 500\" opening credits for the first time as \"Monday Night Football\" Producers Roone Arledge and Chuck Howard along with Directors Larry Kamm and Don Ohlmeyer also did work on this broadcast."

        "text": "The 61st 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 29, 1977. Considered one of the most historically significant editions of the Indianapolis 500, several sidebar stories complemented the unprecedented accomplishment of race winner A. J. Foyt. Foyt became the first driver to win the Indianapolis 500 four times. As of 2023, Foyt's record has been tied by Al Unser Sr., Rick Mears and Hélio Castroneves, but still stands as an Indy 500 record. Foyt's victory is also the last time the winning car (both chassis and engine) was built entirely within the United States.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was part of the 1977 USAC National Championship Trail. After rain-shortened races in three of the past four years (1973, 1975, 1976), the 1977 race was run the full distance under hot and sunny conditions.\nTwo major stories headlined qualifying. During time trials, Tom Sneva won the pole position with a new track record. He became the first driver to break the 200 mph barrier at the Speedway. On the final day of time trials, Janet Guthrie broke the gender barrier by becoming the first female driver to qualify for the Indy 500.\nDuring the summer of 1976, the entire track was repaved in asphalt. It marked the first time since the original brick surface was laid in the fall of 1909 that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was repaved in its entirety. The surface was allowed to cure over the winter, and during a tire test in March, Gordon Johncock ran a lap of 200.401 mph, an unofficial track record.\nThis would be the final Indy 500 for track owner Tony Hulman, who would die of heart failure on October 27, 1977. IMS Radio Network anchor Sid Collins did not call the race for the first time since 1951. Collins committed suicide on May 2, just five days before opening day, after being diagnosed with ALS. Collins was replaced by new \"Voice of the 500\" Paul Page. Then less than a year later, eight USAC officials would be killed in a plane crash.\nOther historical milestones during the month included the first grandson of a former driver entering (Teddy Pilette) and the first father and son combination attempting to qualify for the same race (Jim and James McElreath Jr.). However, neither Pilette (grandson of 1913 competitor Théodore Pilette) nor McElreath Jr. succeeded in making the field.\nTime trials.\nPole Day – Saturday May 14.\nDuring the first week of practice, several drivers flirted with the elusive 200 mph barrier. Mario Andretti, A. J. Foyt, and Johnny Rutherford all ran unofficial practice laps over 200 mph. All three became immediate favorites for the pole position. Going into the month, the official one-lap track record was still 199.071 mph, set by Johnny Rutherford back in 1973.\nPole day was sunny and warm, and an estimated 200,000 spectators arrived anticipating a record-setting day. No drivers broke the 200 mph barrier during practice on the morning of pole day, but participants and observers expected the record to fall during official time trials. At 11:00 a.m., A. J. Foyt was the first driver to make an attempt. His four-lap speed of 193.465 mph was far short of the record. About a half hour later, Al Unser Sr. (195.950 mph) went faster and knocked Foyt off of the top spot.\nAt 11:51 a.m., Tom Sneva took to the track. He set new all-time one-lap and four-lap track records. He became the first driver to break the 200 mph barrier at Indianapolis.\nThough his last two laps dropped off, Sneva's four-lap average was fast enough to secure the pole position. Sneva was rewarded by having 200 silver dollars poured into his helmet. The symbolic gesture, performed by Phil Hedback of Bryant Heating and Cooling Company, mimicked Parnelli Jones, who broke the 150 mph barrier in 1962, and was awarded with 150 silver dollars poured into his helmet.\nAbout an hour later, USAC officials retracted A. J. Foyt's qualifying time. During post-inspection, they discovered that his pop-off valve was fractured and malfunctioned. Since the infraction was not Foyt's fault, he was allowed to re-qualify. Foyt's speed of 194.563 mph was faster than his previous attempt, and he would line up 4th.\nBobby Unser (197.618 mph) put himself in the middle of the front row, bumping his brother Al to the outside. Johnny Rutherford, an early favorite for the front row, waved off his first run, then stalled on his second run. The day ended with the field filled to 16 cars, with Rutherford among those not qualified. Sneva was the only driver to run any laps over 200 mph all afternoon.\nSecond Day – Sunday May 15.\nJohnny Rutherford (197.325 mph) put in the third-fastest speed in the field, but as a second day qualifier, he was forced to line up behind the first day qualifiers in 17th position.\nFive cars completed runs, filling the field to 21 cars. Clay Regazzoni wrecked during his attempt, but was not seriously injured. Regazzoni was planning on running both Indy and the Monaco Grand Prix, but the crash complicated his travel schedule.\nThird Day – Saturday May 21.\nClay Regazzoni started the day in Monte Carlo, but rain washed out his chance to qualify for the Monaco Grand Prix. Car owner Teddy Yip made plans to fly him back to Indy and attempt to qualify for the 500. Mario Andretti, who put in a safe qualifying time at Indy the weekend before, remained in Monaco to compete in the race, he would finish 5th.\nQualifying was sparse during the early parts of the day, with at least 12 cars taking to the track, but only two attempts run to completion. At the end of the day, the field was filled to 27 cars. Clay Regazzoni did not make it to the Speedway in enough time, and he would have to wait until Sunday.\nBump Day – Sunday May 22.\nThe final day of time trials became a historic milestone in auto racing history. Janet Guthrie was the first car to take the track, and she became the first female driver to qualify for the Indianapolis 500. Her four-lap average of 188.403 mph put her safely in the field, and she was the fastest car of the afternoon. Like he did for Tom Sneva a week earlier, Phil Hedback poured 188 silver dollars in her helmet, matching her qualifying speed, which was also a female closed-course speed record.\nAfter a hectic travel burden, Clay Regazzoni finally put a car in the field.\nAt about 3:30 p.m., Salt Walther (184.549 mph) completed a run, followed later by Bubby Jones (184.938 mph), and the field was filled to 33 cars. Cliff Hucul (187.198 mph) bumped out Walther. With about an hour to go, Eldon Rasmussen bumped out Vern Schuppan, and John Mahler bumped out Joe Saldana.\nThe final hour of qualifying saw several drivers try, but fail, to bump their way in. Young rookie Rick Mears was too slow on his two attempts, and he failed to qualify. Jim Hurtubise once again was the center of attention for a few minutes, as he rolled out his Mallard/Offy to the qualifying line. After one slow lap he waved off, and it was the final qualifying attempt ever made by a front-engined car at Indy.\nAs the 6 o'clock gun fired, James McElreath, Jr. was the final car on the track, but his speed was too slow to make the field. Jim and James, Jr. were trying to become the first father and son to qualify for the same Indy 500. James, Jr. fell short, however, and would die in a sprint car crash later in the year, never having a chance to race together.\nCarburetion Day – Thursday May 26.\nAfter qualifying closed, the team of Salt Walther purchased the qualified car of Bill Puterbaugh from owner Lee Elkins. Salt's father George and brother Jeff were responsible for the purchase, and paid a reported $60,000 for the entry, and subsequently fired Puterbaugh from the ride. Salt Walther was named the new driver for the car, and it was repainted in his livery. According to the rules, the car would have to move to the rear of the field on race day. Almost immediately, the situation received significant negative criticism. A day later, Puterbaugh was reinstated to the ride, therefore Puterbaugh was reinstated to his 28th starting position.\nThe final practice day saw Johnny Rutherford (194.533 mph) set the fastest lap. Mike Mosley was the only incident of the day, suffering a broken piston. Later in the afternoon, Jim McElreath's #73 Carrillo team won the first annual Miller Pit Stop Contest.\nStarting lineup.\nFailed to qualify.\n' = Indianapolis 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner\nRace summary.\nPre-race.\nAfter Janet Guthrie became the first female driver to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, controversy began to surround the famous starting command, \"Gentlemen, start your engines!\" Speedway management did not want to alter the traditional phrase. During the week before the race, the management announced that they would not change the wording of the command, but numerous suggestions were being offered by various promoters and members of the media around the country. Looking for an excuse, the management insisted that the cars were actually started by male crew members with an electric hand-held starter from behind the car. Guthrie and her crew were quite displeased by the stubbornness of the Speedway management, considering her unprecedented accomplishment. The crew reacted by assigning Kay Bignotti (wife of George Bignotti) as the crew member to operate the inertial starter at the back of Guthrie's car. The Speedway's argument fell apart, and they decided upon a special amended command for that year. They did not announce beforehand what the special command would be, and Hulman's highly anticipated phrase was the following:\nThe issues with the starting command were not Guthrie's only troubles. On the morning of the race, an official inspecting the pit area discovered that Guthrie's pit side fuel tank hose was leaking. Dripping methanol fuel was observed under the tank, and officials threatened to disqualify the team if they could not contain the leak. A hasty repair was made by wrapping a plastic bag around the hose, and the officials were satisfied.\nFirst half.\nAt the start, Al Unser swept from the outside of the front row, and led into turn one. Polesitter Tom Sneva grabbed second. Bobby Unser settled into third. Johnny Rutherford over-revved the engine, and dropped out with gearbox failure. Janet Guthrie was in the pits early with engine trouble. She would suffer a long day of numerous frustrating pits stops.\nGordon Johncock took the lead for the first time on lap 18. After Johncock pitted, A. J. Foyt led laps 27–51.\nLloyd Ruby crashed in turn two and brought out the yellow on lap 49. It would be Ruby's final Indy 500. During the sequence of pit stops, Gordon Johncock came to the lead, and led most of the laps to the midpoint.\nEldon Rasmussen brought out the yellow for a spin on lap 69. He was able to continue. It was only the second, and would be the last, on-track incident of the race. At the halfway point, attrition had taken its toll during the hot day. Only 17 cars were still running.\nSecond half.\nGordon Johncock was the dominating leader in the second half. He took the lead again on lap 97, and led through lap 179. A. J. Foyt, Tom Sneva, and Al Unser were the closest pursuers.\nA long stretch of green flag racing continued until lap 159, when George Snider and Pancho Carter stalled on the track.\nAfter numerous attempts to re-join the race, Janet Guthrie finally dropped out on the leader's lap 149, having completed only 27 laps. On one of the many pit stops, fuel from the overflow hose leaked out and spilled into the cockpit. Guthrie's crew had to escort her back to the garage area and find a place for her to shower off in private (there were no women's restrooms in the garage area at the time) to clean off the spilled fuel prior to addressing the media.\nTwo cycles of pit stops remained for the leaders. Gordon Johncock continued to lead A. J. Foyt. Tom Sneva was also still on the lead lap. The three leaders made the next-to-last pits stops within one lap of each other. Johncock was beginning to complain of dehydration and heat exhaustion, and the crew doused him with water. Johncock, however, managed to return to the track with a lead of about 15–20 seconds.\nFinish.\nWith 20 laps to go, Johncock still led Foyt by 10 seconds. Sneva was lurking in third place. With Johncock physically ailing, A. J. Foyt began to close the margin. Johncock made his final stop on lap 181. He took on fuel only, and the crew again doused him with water. He pulled away after a 14.7 second stop. Two laps later, Foyt made his final stop. Foyt took on right side tires and fuel, and was away in only 12.9 seconds. Johncock re-assumed the lead, but it was down to only 7 seconds.\nSuddenly as Johncock hit the mainstretch the next time around to complete lap 184, a huge cloud of smoke came from his car and he veered to the inside. Johncock parked the car in turn one with a broken crankshaft. Foyt inherited the lead with only 16 laps to go. Johncock climbed from his car, and hopped into the infield creek to splash some water on himself to cool off.\nFoyt now held a nearly 30-second lead over second place Tom Sneva. Foyt was able to cruise comfortably over the final 15 laps and became the first driver to win the Indianapolis 500 four times.\nPost race.\nThe historic accomplishment was highly celebrated, and Foyt invited track owner Tony Hulman to ride with him in the pace car to salute the fans. It was one of the very few times that Tony Hulman rode with the winner of the race, and his last, as he died the following October.\nTom Sneva bettered his 6th-place finish from the previous year to a solid 2nd place. It was his first of three runner-up finishes prior to his 1983 victory. He would ride this momentum by winning the Pocono 500 later in the season, and won the 1977 USAC National Championship. His brother Jerry Sneva came home tenth, and won rookie of the year honors.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Following the suicide of chief announcer Sid Collins on May 2, Paul Page was elevated to the anchor position and became the new \"Voice of the 500.\" Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. Fred Agabashian returned for his 12th and final year as the \"driver expert.\" At the opening of the broadcast, veteran Jim Shelton reported on the death of Collins to the worldwide listening audience, then introduced Page as the new anchor.\nPaul Page had been groomed by Sid Collins to be his eventual replacement. Despite the bereavement of the crew regarding Collins’ death, the broadcast was a flawless affair, and ushered in a new era for the network. In the coming years, Page would upgrade the workings of the broadcast, including enhanced communication with the reporters, and new talent at the positions.\nThis would be the 30th year for Jim Shelton on the crew, reporting from his familiar fourth turn position. Darl Wible debuted on the crew in 1977, reporting from the backstretch location. Bob Forbes served as the wireless roving reporter in the garages. Among the celebrities interviewed in the pits were Evel Knievel, Sam Hanks, and Formula One commentator Anthony Marsh.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. \"Heavy Action\" was used in an \"Indianapolis 500\" opening credits for the second time as \"Monday Night Football\" Producers Roone Arledge and Chuck Howard along with Directors Chet Forte and Larry Kamm also did work on this broadcast. Jim McKay anchored the broadcast. The broadcast took place in the midst of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians strike at ABC. Unlike previous years during this era, ABC-TV got the first interview with the race winner, as Bill Flemming spoke with A. J. Foyt prior to Lou Palmer.\nThe broadcast has re-aired in partiality on ESPN Classic since May 2011.\nThe broadcast is also available for free via the official IndyCar Series and official Indianapolis Motor Speedway YouTube channels."

        "text": "The 62nd 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 28, 1978. Danny Ongais dominated the early stages of the race but eventually dropped out with a blown engine. Al Unser Sr. dominated the second half, and held a large lead late in the race. However, Unser bent the front wing of his Lola during a pit stop on lap 180, causing his handling to go away over the final twenty laps. Second place Tom Sneva charged to catch Unser's crippled Lola but came up 8 seconds short at the finish line – the second-closest finish in Indy history to that point. Unser held off the challenge, and became a three-time winner of the 500. It was Al Unser's third Indy victory in the decade of the 1970s, and the fifth of nine overall victories by the Unser family.\nAl Unser Sr. entered the month having won the 1977 California 500 at Ontario the previous September. Later in the 1978 season, Unser would go on to win the Pocono 500 and the California 500 again, sweeping the \"triple crown\" of Indy car racing for 1978. As of 2015 (the last year there was a \"Triple Crown\") Unser is the only driver in history to win all three 500-mile \"triple crown\" races in the same season, and coupled with the win at Ontario in 1977, set a record by winning four straight 500-mile Indy car races.\nSecond year driver Janet Guthrie finished ninth, and it was later revealed she drove with a fractured wrist. It was the highest finish for a female driver in Indy history until Danica Patrick finished in fourth place in 2005. During time trials, Tom Sneva, who had broken the barrier a year earlier, bettered his own record. This time he managed to complete all four qualifying laps over , setting once again new one-lap and four-lap track records.\nTony Hulman, the popular owner and president of the track since 1945, died the previous October. His widow Mary F. Hulman was named the chairperson of the board of the Speedway, and for the first time she delivered the famous starting command. Along with the death of Tony Hulman, the race was held just five weeks after eight USAC officials were killed in a plane crash. With dissent increasing among the participants about organizational issues and poor revenue, the 1978 race would be the final Indy 500 contested prior to the formation of CART and prior to the first open wheel \"split.\"\nAl Unser's victory was the first Indy triumph for the Cosworth DFX V8 engine. The British-based engine building company would go on to win the Indianapolis 500 for ten consecutive years.\nPractice and time trials.\nOn Wednesday May 10, Mario Andretti turned a practice lap of , faster than the track record. Minutes later, Danny Ongais upped the best speed to . On Thursday May 11, rookie Rick Mears () also joined the coveted \" club\" in practice. Johnny Rutherford () and A. J. Foyt () were also within striking distance.\nOn Friday May 12, the final day of practice before pole qualifying was scheduled to be held, Mario Andretti shattered the unofficial track record, turning a lap of . Also over were Mears, Rutherford, and Foyt. Tom Sneva, the driver who broke the barrier a year earlier, was the slowest of the three Penske cars, managing only a lap during practice.\nThe first weekend of time trials was scheduled for May 13–14. Rain washed out the entire first weekend, and pole qualifying was moved to Saturday May 20.\nThe rainout complicated the schedule for Mario Andretti. He was forced to leave the track and fly to Zolder for the Grand Prix of Belgium. Arrangements were being made for another driver to qualify the car for him, and he would return to the cockpit for race day. With no track activity possible at Indy for Sunday, A. J. Foyt flew to Talladega and finished third in the NASCAR Winston 500.\nDuring the second week of practice, Pancho Carter and Tom Sneva joined the \" club.\" Sneva had a hand-timed lap of about , inching closer to Andretti's mark from the previous week. Danny Ongais destroyed his primary car in a crash in turn four on Tuesday May 16. He was not seriously injured, but would have to qualify with his back-up car.\nPole Day – Saturday May 20.\nPole day dawned with temperatures in the high 70s and low 80s. Qualifying started promptly at 11:00 a.m., with Johnny Rutherford first out on the track. He fell short of the barrier on all four laps, and settled for an average of .\nAt 12:03 p.m., Tom Sneva took to the track. Following in his own footsteps from the previous year, he set new all-time one and four lap track records, becoming the first driver in Indy history to complete all four qualifying laps over .\nDue to changes in the rules in subsequent years, his one and four lap track records would stand until 1982. Sneva's four-lap average secured the pole position, his second pole in a row.\nSneva's Penske teammate, rookie Rick Mears, was the next car out. Mears completed three laps over , and his four-lap average of was a rookie speed record, and would be good enough for the front row.\nJanet Guthrie returned for her second start, and qualified strongly at . At 12:39 p.m., Danny Ongais made it an \"all \" front row, securing second starting position at .\nAfter practicing over , A. J. Foyt was forced to wave off his run, and missed his chance to qualify in the pole round. Mike Hiss was hired by Penske to drive substitute for Mario Andretti during time trials. He qualified the car with a respectable speed of (8th). However, on race day, Andretti would get back in the car, and he would be forced to line up in the 33rd starting position due to the driver switch.\nRain late in the day hampered the qualifying attempts. The trip through the original qualifying line exhausted at 5 p.m., and Tom Sneva officially secured the pole position. Several drivers including Bobby Unser, A. J. Foyt, and Pancho Carter, were unable to qualify during the pole round. At 5 p.m., the \"third day\" of time trials officially commenced, and those drivers would line up behind the cars from the pole round.\nThe day ended with the field filled to twenty cars. Bobby Unser finished his run as a \"third day\" qualifier in the rain. The track was closed for the day as soon as Unser returned to the pits at 5:11 p.m.\nBump Day – Sunday May 21.\nThe final day of time trials opened with 13 spots unfilled. A. J. Foyt at was the fastest of the day. His speed was tied for second-fastest, but as a final day qualifier, he would line up 20th.\nRoger Rager was the only major on-track incident of the day. On his second warm-up lap, he hit the outside wall in turn four, suffering an injured hand. He would miss the race. Larry Cannon brushed the wall on his second qualifying lap, and Dick Simon brushed the wall on the main stretch shaking down a car for Bill Puterbaugh. The car lost two wheels and it was too late in the day for the car to be repaired.\nIn the final hour, there was one spot left in the field when Bob Harkey was preparing to make his attempt. Jim Hurtubise, who had once again entered his now-infamous Mallard/Offy front-engined car, had been denied the permission to qualify, due to lack of speed. USAC had decided to set a minimum speed in order to pass \"final\" inspection, receive the appropriate sticker, and be allowed to make a qualifying attempt. They deemed Hurtubise ineligible, claiming he had not broken , despite some claiming he had lapped over . Hurtubise considered the ruling a personal harassment, lies, and an effort by USAC, Goodyear, and the Speedway to single him out and keep him from qualifying. After being a popular fixture amongst the fans for many years, several episodes of antics had caused some to begin to view Hurtubise unfavorably. Hurtubise got into a heated exchange with chief steward Tom Binford, then proceeded to climb into Harkey's car, shouting \"If I can't qualify, no one can!\" After a few minutes, Hurtubise was coaxed out of the car, and Harkey climbed in to crank it up. With some encouragement from the crowd, Hurtubise then jumped in front of Harkey, preventing him from pulling out of the pits. He had to be restrained by safety patrol members, and Harkey managed to pull away. While Harkey was on the backstretch of his warm-up lap, Hurtubise jumped over the pit wall and ran out on the race track in order to disrupt and halt the qualifying attempt. Running down the main stretch, several guards chased after him. Hurtubise was tackled by John Martin and was then detained by police. By this time, the crowd's opinion had changed, and they began booing and jeering Hurtubise for going too far by disrupting qualifying. Hurtubise was banned from the track for the remainder of the month.\nHarkey managed to finish his qualifying attempt without incident, but his speed was not fast enough to stand. Within twenty minutes, Harkey was bumped by Joe Saldana. The day closed with Cliff Hucul bumping Graham McRae with two minutes left in the day.\nAfter missing time trials, Mario Andretti won the Grand Prix of Belgium. He traveled back to Indianapolis during the week, and would be back in time for Carburetion Day \"tests.\"\nStarting lineup.\nFailed to qualify.\n' = Indianapolis 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner\nRace summary.\nStart.\nRace day dawned hot and humid, with temperatures in the high 80s (°F). After the death of Tony Hulman, the starting command was recited by his widow Mary F. Hulman. With Janet Guthrie in the field once again, the traditional command was again tweaked. This time command was worded \"Lady and Gentlemen, start your engines!\"\nDuring the pace laps, Gary Bettenhausen pulled into the pits with mechanical trouble, and missed the start. At the green flag, Danny Ongais darted into the lead, with Tom Sneva falling in line behind him in second. Rick Mears suddenly faded and pulled to the outside, and was passed by several cars. Ongais completed the first lap at a record speed of .\nSheldon Kinser stalled on the backstretch, and brought out the yellow light for three laps. Rick Mears ducked into the pits for an unscheduled stop. He had neglected to fasten his helmet strap properly, and nearly lost his helmet at the start of the race. He was able to properly fasten his helmet, and returned to the race.\nThe green came back out on lap 5, with Ongais pulling out to a comfortable lead. Cliff Hucul went to pits, and was out of the race with a broken oil line.\nFirst half.\nMario Andretti quickly charged from last starting position to run as high as 13th in the early going. However, he was forced to pit to change a bad spark plug wire. He lost 8 laps, and was effectively out of contention for the rest of the day.\nOn lap 26, Spike Gehlhausen crashed exiting turn 2, and came to rest along the outside wall on the backstretch. Leader Danny Ongais was in the pits when the yellow came out, which gave the lead temporarily to Steve Krisiloff. However, under the yellow light condition, Krisiloff violated the PACER light rules, and was penalized one lap. That gave the lead to Tom Sneva. With Ongais in second right behind Sneva, the green light came back on down the backstretch on lap 31. Sneva led for barely a lap, and Ongais passed him for the lead the next time by.\nSalt Walther dropped out with a bad clutch, and proceeded to rant his frustration of his chief mechanic Tommy Smith during a heated television interview. It was reported that Smith made a change to the throttling system the night before the race; while Walther's team worked on repairing the car, Smith reportedly left the track, having parted ways with the team.\nDanny Ongais led 68 of the first 75 laps. The team reported that Ongais had lost his two-way radio, and was forced to communicate only by sign boards for the rest of the race.\nAl Unser Sr. took the lead for the first time on lap 76. He held the lead at the halfway point. A. J. Foyt, who had charged near the front early on, started to fade, and after long pit stops, was laps down to the leaders. Janet Guthrie, on the other hand, was moving up into the top ten.\nSecond half.\nRookie Rick Mears dropped out after 103 laps with a blown engine. By lap 120, thirteen cars were out of the race, with hot conditions contributing to the attrition.\nAl Unser Sr. led, with Danny Ongais and Tom Sneva in the top three. Unser continued to hold a small lead over Ongais, with his crew's efficient and quick pit stops increasing the margin.\nSuddenly on lap 145, second place Danny Ongais came into the pits with smoke pouring from the car. After having led 71 laps (nearly half the race up to that point), Ongais was out with a blown engine.\nFinish.\nAl Unser Sr. led second place Tom Sneva by over 20 seconds. Those were the only two cars left on the lead lap. On lap 180, Unser came onto the pits for his final stop. Unser overshot his pit box by a few feet, and hit a spare tire with his front wing. The team decided not to change tires, and filled the car with fuel only. His stop was 17 seconds, his worst pit stop of the day.\nOne lap later, Tom Sneva pitted, taking fuel only. His pit stop, however, was not fast, and he did not immediately gain ground on Unser. With a 30-second lead, Unser had 19 laps to victory. However, his front wing was damaged from hitting the tire, and Unser's handling was starting to go away. Sneva began cutting away at his lead, by about a second per lap.\nWith three laps to go, Sneva had cut the lead to 14 seconds. Then with one lap to go, it was down to 10 seconds.\nOn the final lap, third place Gordon Johncock slipped by Unser to get one of his laps back. Unser nursed the car around on the final lap, and won this third Indy 500. Second place for the second year in a row Tom Sneva finished 8.09 seconds behind, the second-closest finish in Indy history to that point.\nWally Dallenbach and A. J. Foyt both stalled on the course out of fuel, but both finished strongly, 5th and 7th, respectively. Janet Guthrie finished 9th, and revealed after the race that she drove with a fractured wrist. Two days before the race, she fell during a charity tennis match, suffering the injury.\nLate in the race, the Patrick Racing Wildcats of Gordon Johncock and Steve Krisiloff were penalized one lap by stewards - Johncock for running over an air-hose, and Krisiloff for speeding too fast under caution. If the penalties had not happened, Johncock would have barely finished runner-up behind Al Unser, and Krisiloff would have still finished fourth, but would have been the only driver one lap down. George Bignotti announced his intentions to protest Johncock's penalty, claiming that officials overlooked Unser running over his air hose, and did not treat both drivers equally. However, post-race footage showed that Unser, although coming very close, did not run over his air hose, and the team declined to protest.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network.

On that day while he was doing a helicopter traffic report, Page was nearly killed in an accident, as the helicopter he was riding aboard crashed near Speedway Senior High School in Speedway, Indiana. Page would fully recover to call the race. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. Mike Hiss, who had served as a substitute driver for Mario Andretti during time trials, served as the \"driver expert.\"\nThis would be the 31st and final year for Jim Shelton on the crew.

        "text": "The 63rd 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday May 27, 1979. Second-year driver Rick Mears took the lead for the final time with 18 laps to go, and won his first of four Indianapolis 500 races. It was also Mears' first of a record six Indy 500 pole positions. Brothers Al and Bobby Unser combined to lead 174 of the 200 laps, but Al dropped out around the midpoint, and Bobby slipped to 5th place at the finish nursing mechanical issues. It was also Roger Penske's second Indy 500 victory as a car owner.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was part of the 1979 USAC National Championship. However, many of the participants entered the race only as a one-off, and instead broke off and took part in the inaugural 1979 SCCA/CART Indy Car Series. It was the beginning of the first open-wheel \"split\".\nThe month of May 1979 was filled with controversy on and off the track. A court injunction was issued after USAC initially denied entries by some teams that were part of the CART series. During time trials, several cars were disqualified due to illegal wastegate exhaust pipes. Qualifying closed with the traditional 33 cars in the field. However, the day before the race a special qualifying session was held to allow certain entries a last chance to qualify. Two additional cars were added to the field, for a total of 35 cars (the most since 1933).\nThe high tensions and technical squabbles during the month attracted considerable negative criticism from sports writers and media. The race itself, however, was competitive and entertaining, and completed without major incident or controversy.\nAmong those in attendance was former president Gerald Ford. Ford also served as the grand marshal of the 500 Festival Parade. The 1979 race is also notable in that it was the first to utilize the \"pack-up\" rule during caution periods, eliminating the virtual safety car rules (\"Electro-PACER\") used from 1972 to 1978. The pace car, which started the race, would now lead the field under the yellow flag.\nControversies.\nUSAC/CART \"Split\".\nFollowing the death of Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony Hulman in 1977, and the deadly 1978 USAC plane crash, owners and participants in Indy car racing were anxious to reorganize the sport. By 1978, a growing dissent amongst the participants was based on many factors, including poor promotion and low revenue. Indy Car events outside of the Indianapolis 500 were suffering from poor attendance, and few events were even televised. Robin Miller even accused the Speedway of offering a purse that was too low considering the stature of the event and the costs of racing at the time. Further complicating the issue were rumors that Goodyear was considering pulling out of the sport. In addition, the venerable 4-cylinder turbo Offenhauser (a favorite of the USAC-loyal teams) was at a horsepower disadvantage to the new V8 Cosworth DFX. USAC began retooling turbocharger boost rules to ensure the Offy and the \"stock block\" engines remained competitive, which caused new disagreements about equivalency formulas and favoritism.\nDriver, owner, and advocate Dan Gurney published a white paper lobbying several complaints and charges against USAC and IMS, concluding that new organization was necessary to ensure the success of Indy car racing into the future. In late 1978, several existing Indy car owners broke off and created the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) series with some initial assistance from the Sports Car Club of America (in order to be recognized by Automobile Competition Committee for the United States). The seed of dissent had been growing for several years before the accident, and claims the crash was an immediate cause for the 1979 USAC/CART \"split\" are considered for the most part unfounded.\nThe first major salvo was made on March 25, 1979, when the CART-based teams boycotted the USAC Datsun Twin 200 at Ontario Motor Speedway. A. J. Foyt, who at first sided with the CART contingent, retracted his loyalty, and crossed back over to the USAC side. After the boycott, Foyt suggested that USAC should penalize the CART-based teams, and refuse their entries to the Indy 500. Among the drivers affected were Bobby Unser, Al Unser, Johnny Rutherford, Danny Ongais, Gordon Johncock, Steve Krisiloff, and Wally Dallenbach – some of the top names in the sport.\nThree days before the published deadline, CART president U. E. \"Pat\" Patrick delivered a block of 44 entries to the 1979 Indianapolis 500 for the CART-based teams. On April 19, however, the USAC board of directors voted unanimously to reject the entries of six key teams: Penske, Patrick, McLaren, Fletcher, Chaparral, and Gurney. These six teams (19 cars) were alleged to be \"harmful to racing\" and \"not in good standing with USAC.\" USAC sent the owners a telegram informing them of the situation while they were participating in the CART race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, the Gould Twin Dixie 125s.\nOn April 26, the \"rejected six\" teams filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, requesting an injunction to allow the teams to compete in the 1979 Indy 500. They cited antitrust and restraint of trade. On May 5, judge James Ellsworth Noland issued the injunction, but restrained the teams from disrupting or interfering with the running of the event.\nIllegal wastegate manifolds.\nDuring the month, a second controversy erupted regarding the technical regulations of the turbocharger wastegate. The specifications called for wastegate exhaust pipes to be a minimum of 1.470 inches (inside diameter). The standard pipe diameter was typically 2 inches. In addition, the pop-off valves affixed to the cars were to be set at 50 inHg of \"boost\" for qualifying (down from 80 inHg). USAC issued a last-minute ruling that in-car adjustments of the boost dial would be banned during time trials.\nA few teams discovered what they considered a \"loophole\" in the rules. They utilized a larger diameter wastegate pipe, but welded a washer inside of it that had a circular opening of exactly 1.470 inches. This had the effect of creating back pressure, in hopes of over-riding the pop-off valve, and thus over-boosting the engine, and increasing horsepower.\nOn May 19 (the third day of time trials) the cars of Dick Ferguson, Steve Krisiloff, and Tom Bigelow were disqualified and fined $5,000 because they \"had altered their wastegate exhaust pipes by the addition of restrictions which significantly affect the air flow.\" USAC charged that the teams had tampered with the wastegate exhaust pipe, thus illegally over-riding the pop-off valve, and potentially over-boosting the engine. An appeal was made the next morning, but USAC denied the appeal. Furthermore, they released a memo which stated that any cars qualifying on Sunday May 20 must have unrestricted wastegate pipes (no washers were allowed to be welded inside) that are exactly 1.470 inches in diameter or greater.\nThe ruling created controversy in the garage area, as a further examination of the rules showed a \"gray area\" regarding the inlet opening configuration. In addition, several complaints surfaced when teams charged USAC with essentially changing the rules in the middle of qualifying – a move which actually affected other already-qualified cars from the first weekend.\nThe controversy ultimately led to a fifth day of time trials, held the day before the race. Eleven entries that were identified as being denied a fair attempt to qualify were allowed to participate. Each car was allowed one attempt, and if they completed their run faster than the slowest car already in the field, they would qualify for the starting grid. The ruling allowed for a potential 44-car field on race day. Only two cars accomplished the feat, and they were added to the back of the grid for a field of 35 cars.\nPractice – Week 1.\nSaturday May 5.\nOpening Day saw sparse activity. Only three cars took to the track, with Larry \"Boom Boom\" Cannon earning the honor of first car on the track. Later in the day, judge James Ellsworth Noland issued the injunction requested by the CART teams, and all entries were allowed to practice. Dick Simon, who was subpoenaed to testify downtown at the hearing, spent enough time at the track to run a lap of , the fastest of the day.\nSunday May 6.\nHurley Haywood was the fastest of the day with a lap at . The previously rejected CART teams arrived at the garage area, but none took to the track.\nMonday May 7.\nThe \"Rejected Six\" CART teams took their first laps of the month, with Rick Mears turning the fastest lap of the day at . Danny Ongais was a close second at . Spike Gehlhausen had the only incident of the day, when a water line broke, spewing hot fluid into the cockpit. He suffered first and second degree burns, but was cleared to drive.\nTuesday May 8.\nMears ran the fastest speed of the month thus far, with a hand-timed lap of .\nWednesday May 9.\nA. J. Foyt moved to the top of the speed chart, completing a lap at . Al Unser was second-fastest at .\nThursday May 10.\nFoyt bettered his speed from Wednesday at , maintaining his grasp on the fastest lap of the month.\nFriday May 11.\nBobby Unser became the latest driver over , and Al Unser, Sr. was the fastest of the afternoon at . Moisture kept the track closed until 1:10 p.m., meaning only 2 hours and 10 minutes were lost due to weather all month thus far. Foyt finished the week with the top practice speed, and Mears had several hand-timed laps in the range.\nTime Trials – Weekend 1.\nPole Day – Saturday May 12.\nRain kept the track closed on pole day until after 4 p.m. At 4:19 p.m., the track opened for practice, with the temperature and winds up to . During the first practice session, Danny Ongais, a favorite for the front row, wrecked in turn 4 after completing a lap of . He was pinned in the car for over twenty minutes, and suffered a concussion. He was taken to Methodist Hospital for observation, and returned to his home in Costa Mesa, California, for a few days to recuperate.\nThe crash by Ongais kept the track closed for 40 minutes as crews extricated him from the car and cleaned up the debris. Two other yellows closed the track for another ten minutes, and the day came to a close at 6 p.m. without a single car being able to make a qualifying attempt.\nSecond Day – Sunday May 13.\nPole qualifying shifted to Sunday, with partly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s. Due to the new technical rules for 1979, including pop-off valve settings and wastegate regulations, the speeds in time trials were not expected to reach those set in 1977–1978 (over ). A hectic, non-stop day of qualifying occurred, with no less than 45 cars pulling away for qualifying attempts.\nJohnny Rutherford was the first driver to complete a run at , and became the coveted 'first driver in the field.' Wally Dallenbach was the next car out, and temporarily put himself on the pole with a speed of . Shortly before 1 p.m. Al Unser Sr. took over the provisional pole position with a four-lap average of . A little over an hour later, Al's brother Bobby Unser put himself temporarily in second position at .\nAt 4 p.m., Tom Sneva (who won the pole position in 1977–1978) took to the track looking for his record third consecutive Indy 500 pole. He took over the top spot with a four-lap average of . There were only two cars left in line with a legitimate shot for the pole: A. J. Foyt and Rick Mears.\nAt 4:32 p.m., Foyt's run of was far short of being fast enough for the pole, but secured him a spot in row 2. The final qualifier for the pole round was Rick Mears. His four-lap average of won him his first of what would be record six career Indy 500 pole positions. Sneva was bumped to second on the grid.\nAt 4:50 p.m., the original pole qualifying round was over, and \"Second Day\" qualifying commenced. At the end of the day, the field was filled to 25 cars.\nPractice – Week 2.\nMonday May 14.\nUSAC announced that for the first time, the \"pack-up rule\" would be used during caution periods at the Indy 500. Like the format used in NASCAR and at other Indy car races, when the caution flag came out, the pace car would enter the track and pick up the leader. The remainder of the field would bunch up behind the pace car. The previous system, the Electro-PACER Light system, was scrapped.\nJohnny Rutherford, who was already in the field, posted the fastest lap at . Bobby Unser shook down a Penske back-up car, which some speculated would be for Mario Andretti. Andretti was participating in Formula One full-time in 1979 to defend his 1978 World Championship, and a scheduling conflict with Monaco was expected to keep Mario away from Indy in 1979.\nTuesday May 15.\nVern Schuppan was the fastest of the non-qualified drivers at . Bobby Unser continued to practice in the back-up car, but insisted it was to test nose configurations and not being prepared for another driver.\nWednesday May 16.\nEldon Rasmussen crashed in turn three, but was not injured. Later, Roger Rager spun in turn 3, but did not make contact. Johnny Rutherford was the fastest of the day at .\nThursday May 17.\nBilly Engelhart wrecked in turn 1, suffering a broken leg, and was sidelined for the rest of the month. Speeds dropped off for the day, with A. J. Foyt having the best lap of the day at . Heavy activity amongst the numerous non-qualified cars was noted.\nFriday May 18.\nThe final full day of practice saw heavy activity with no incidents reported. Danny Ongais returned to the track to get ready to qualify, but Dr. Thomas A. Hanna, the Speedway medical director, would not clear him to drive for the day.\nDespite some unfounded rumors circulating around the garage area, Mario Andretti decided not to skip Monaco, and would miss the Indy 500 for the first time since arriving as a rookie in 1965. Meanwhile, Indy rookie and NASCAR regular Neil Bonnett flew to Dover to qualify for the Mason-Dixon 500. He planned on putting in a qualifying time for the Winston Cup race on Friday, then returning Saturday to Indianapolis in order to qualify for the Indy 500. However, it rained in Dover on Friday, washing out Cup qualifying. NASCAR qualifying was shifted to Saturday, and due to the time constraints, Bonnett decided to withdraw from Indy. Jerry Sneva took over the car. Bonnett went on to win the Dover NASCAR race, and never returned to Indy.\nTime Trials – Weekend 2.\nThird Day – Saturday May 19.\nThe third day of time trials saw heavy activity. The day opened with 8 spots available on the grid. Hurley Haywood was the first car to go out, and he ran his first lap over . His second and third laps, however, dropped off drastically, and his crew waved off.\nSeveral cars went out in the first hour, and at 1:15 p.m., Jim McElreath filled the field to 33 cars. Larry Cannon was the first car on the bubble. Dick Simon bumped him out with ease. Tom Bigelow was now on the bubble. He survived three wave offs, but Jerry Sneva managed to bump him out at 2 p.m. Jerry Sneva's run was not without excitement, as he suffered a stuck throttle. Rather than wave off, he managed to control the engine with the kill switch, and completed the four laps without incident.\nWith John Martin now on the bubble, Dick Ferguson took to the track. His speed of bumped Martin from the field. However, in post-inspection, Ferguson was disqualified and fined $5,000 for an illegal wastegate inlet. Rather than welding a washer inside of the wastegate like others had done, his mechanic Wayne Woodward had welded a complete obstruction in the pipe, attempting to illegally over-ride the popoff valve. Martin was re-instated to the field. Meanwhile, Tom Bigelow bumped out Steve Krisiloff as this was going on.\nMartin didn't last long, as Steve Krisiloff got into his backup car and bumped him out a few minutes later. The day concluded with Larry Rice bumping out John Mahler.\nAfter the track closed, USAC disqualified Steve Krisiloff and Tom Bigelow for the same infraction that Dick Ferguson was disqualified for earlier – illegal wastegate exhaust pipes and attempting to over-ride the pop-off valve. As a result, the bumped cars of John Mahler and John Martin were re-instated to the field.\nBump Day – Sunday May 20.\nAfter the disqualification of three cars on Saturday, USAC issued a memo clarifying their wastegate specifications. Some teams began to voice their complaints that it was not fair for USAC to essentially change the rules midway through time trials. With the increased scrutiny on the wastegate inlets, drivers claimed it was difficult for a legal car to bump out a car already in the field that had cheated, and that the officials were not policing it properly.\nThe final day scheduled for qualifying began on time around noon. Bill Alsup was the first car to make an attempt, and John Martin was bumped out of the field once again. Danny Ongais, who returned to the cockpit after his crash last weekend, followed suit by \"re-bumping\" John Mahler. Ongais had complained that USAC officials were deliberately preventing him from returning to the cockpit after his injury. However, after lobbying from his co-competitor and friend Al Unser, officials finally cleared him to drive.\nTom Bigelow and Steve Krisiloff, both whom were disqualified on Saturday, returned to the track, and bumped their way into the field. Dick Ferguson, however, was too slow, and exhausted his three attempts. Further complicating the day, USAC disqualified Bill Alsup for using the same engine that Bobby Unser had already qualified with.\nThe day ended with John Mahler taking the track at 5:59 p.m., and bumping his way back into the field.\nCarburetion Day – Thursday May 24.\nAfter qualifying was closed, eight teams that failed to qualify filed a protest on Monday May 21. They charged that the turbocharger wastegate inlet rules were unfair, and there was too much of a gray area to begin with. In addition, they claimed that many cars that qualified during the first weekend of time trials were technically illegal, but that officials were only closely checking the cars that made attempts on the second weekend.\nThe protest was denied, but USAC president Dick King announced that the 11 cars that were bumped from the field would be allowed a special qualifying session if all 33 cars in the field signed a special agreement. Dick Ferguson was not among the 11 drivers named as eligible for the special session, so his car owner filed suit in county court on Tuesday to have the race halted until his car was re-instated. Part of the suit called for all 33 qualified cars to be summoned to court to have their wastegate pipes measured. The suit was dropped.\nOn Carb Day, Gordon Johncock led the speed chart with a lap of . A total of 34 cars took laps, without any major incidents. Howdy Holmes blew an engine, Mike Mosley blew a transmission, and Salt Walther suffered a broken oil scavenger pump.\nOf the 33 cars thus qualified, 31 took practice laps. Bill Vukovich II and Dana Carter were assigned as the alternates, and both took practice laps as well. Bob Harkey, however, was not eligible to practice, and pulled out on the track anyway. USAC officials black-flagged him, and made him return to the garage area.\nBy mid-day Thursday, only 31 of the 33 cars in the field signed the waiver agreeing to extend time trials. The proposal offered Monday was considered void since two teams refused to sign on.\nAlso that day the 3rd annual Miller Pit Stop Challenge was held. Team McLaren with driver Johnny Rutherford and Chief Mechanics Phil Sharp and Steve Roby won the contest. Runner up was team Jerry O'Connell with driver Tom Sneva.\nSpecial Qualifying Session – Saturday May 26.\nOn Friday May 25, USAC reversed their decision, and declared that in the best interest of the event, they would hold a special qualifying session Saturday morning for the 11 cars that were bumped from the field. The 33 cars that were already in the field were \"locked in,\" and could not be bumped. Each of the eleven cars would be allowed only one attempt. There were no wave offs allowed, and if the run was incomplete, or if the driver missed their turn in line, the attempt was forfeited. If the driver completed the four-lap qualifying run faster than the slowest car in the field (Roger McCluskey at ), he would be added to the rear of the grid. That potentially meant that up to a record 44 cars could start on race day.\nOnly two cars, Bill Vukovich II and George Snider ran fast enough, and the final grid comprised 35 cars. Despite the record number of entries and expanded field, only one rookie, Howdy Holmes, qualified for the race. He would win the rookie of the year award by default.\nStarting Lineup.\nFailed to Qualify.\nOthers.\n' = Indianapolis 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner\nRace summary.\nFirst half.\nRain fell the night before the race, and the weather forecast for race day was bleak. However, in the morning, the skies cleared, the track dried, and the race began on-time as scheduled.\nAt the start, Al Unser Sr. swept from the outside of the front row, and led the field into turn one. Unser was driving Jim Hall's radical new Chaparral 2K chassis. He pulled out to a commanding lead, and proceeded to lead the first 24 laps. Heavy attrition early on saw seven cars out with mechanical problems by lap 22.\nCliff Hucul stalled on lap 28, bringing out the first caution during the first sequence of pit stops. As the field went back to green, Al Unser again dominated. On lap 43, Wally Dallenbach lost a wheel down the backstretch, and had to precariously guide his car back to the pits on three wheels.\nWith Al Unser still dominating, the rest of the top five was Rick Mears, Bobby Unser, and Johnny Rutherford.\nRutherford then headed to the pits with a broken gear. After lengthy repairs, he returned to the race. Leader Al Unser came in for a routine pit stop under the caution on lap 97. Moments later, he was back into the pits after it was reported that something may have been leaking or smoking from the back of the car. Still under the caution, after a quick consultation, Unser returned to the track. The green flag back came out with Bobby Unser now leading.\nSecond half.\nOn lap 103, Al Unser Sr. was running second to Bobby Unser when heavy smoke and flames started coming from the back of the car. The Chaparral 2K experienced a failed transmission oil fitting, and Unser was out of the race. After mutual differences, Unser decided to leave the team at the end of the season.\nWith Al out, his brother Bobby was now in control. Rick Mears was holding second, and A. J. Foyt was moving up to third, one lap down.\nThe first crash of the day involved Larry Rice on lap 156.\nWith twenty laps to go, Bobby Unser led his Penske teammate Rick Mears by a few car lengths. A. J. Foyt was running third, one lap down. Suddenly on lap 181, Bobby Unser veered to the inside of the track. He was off the pace with gearbox trouble. That handed the lead to Rick Mears with 19 laps to go. Less than a lap later, A. J. Foyt (now in second) got by Mears to un-lap himself. Bobby Unser would stay out on the track and nursed his ailing car to a 5th-place finish in third gear.\nFinish.\nRick Mears made his final pit stop from the lead on lap 185. He took on fuel only, and no tires. A. J. Foyt followed, completing a fast 8.5-second pit stop. The leaders pits stops were over, and Mears now held a 38-second lead over Foyt.\nSuddenly with 8 laps to go, Tom Sneva wrecked in turn four, bringing out the yellow, and bunching up the field. The green came back out for one last sprint to the finish with four laps to go. Rick Mears led, with A. J. Foyt at the tail-end of the pack. Mike Mosley was one lap down in third place, however, an early-race scoring error was tentatively showing him two laps down in 5th place. Foyt was mired in heavy traffic, and needed to pass at least 14 cars to catch up to Mears. With Foyt struggling to make up the ground, his engine lost a cylinder. Down on power, Foyt began to slow. Third-place Mosley, fighting to stay ahead of fourth-place Danny Ongais, un-lapped himself on the final lap and continued to charge. Meanwhile, Mears cruised unchallenged to the finish line. Mears in only his second start, won his first of four Indy 500 victories.\nComing off of turn four with the checkered flag waving, A. J. Foyt's engine quit. He pulled to the inside and was coasting down the frontstretch towards the finish line. Mike Mosley was storming down the frontstretch at full speed, but Foyt nipped him at the finish line by 2.3 seconds to hold on to second position. Though it was not known at the moment, Mosley's charge on the final lap nearly gave him second place. After the race, officials discovered a scoring error, and realized that Mosely was not credited with a lap at the start of the race. In the official results, Mosely was credited with third place, just behind Foyt.\nBill Vukovich II, who was one of only two drivers to make the field during the special Saturday qualifying session, charged all the way from 34th starting position to 8th at the finish.\nBorn in 1951, Rick Mears became the first Indy 500 winner born after World War II. It was also the last checkered flag for USAC chief starter/flagman Pat Vidan. This would be the final Indianapolis 500 participation for Team McLaren who left Indy car racing as a team all together until their return in 2017.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\n Indicates diver eligible for CART Championship points only.\n Indicates driver eligible for USAC Championship Trail points only.\nChampionship standings.\nPoints championship standings after this race.

        "title": "1969 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 53rd International 500 Mile Sweepstakes was an auto race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Friday, May 30, 1969. It was the third round of the 1969 USAC Championship Car season. Polesitter A. J. Foyt led the race in the early stages, looking to become the first four-time winner of the 500. Near the halfway point, however, a lengthy pit stop to repair a broken manifold put him many laps down. Despite a hard-charging run towards the end, he wound up managing only an eighth-place finish, 19 laps down. Lloyd Ruby, a driver with a hard-luck reputation at the Speedway, was leading the race just after the midpoint. During a pit stop, he pulled away with the fueling hose still attached, ripped a hole in the fuel tank, and was out of the race. The incident put Mario Andretti in the lead for rest of the way.\nMario Andretti led 116 laps total and won for car owner Andy Granatelli. With Andretti's finish time of 3:11:14.71, it was the fastest run Indianapolis 500 up to that date, breaking the previous record by nearly five minutes. Andretti's victory capped off an up-and-down month of May. He entered the month as a favorite, but he crashed his primary car, a radical four-wheel-drive Lotus, during practice. Andretti suffered burns but was able to qualify a back-up car in the middle of the front row. Mario Andretti's 1969 Indy 500 win is the lone victory at the race for the storied Andretti racing family. As of 2024, no Andretti has won the Indianapolis 500 since. Likewise, it was a triumphant first victory for owner Granatelli, after a long presence at Indianapolis - and a long string of disappointments, first with Novis, and then with the Turbines.\nWhile Foyt and Andretti qualified 1st-2nd, the most notable story from time trials was the plight of Leon Duray \"Jigger\" Sirois, whose pit crew inadvisedly waved off his qualifying run on pole day. It would go down in history as one of the most famous gaffes in Indy history.\nAfter five drivers were killed at the Speedway in the decade of the 1960s, the month of May 1969 was relatively clean, with no major injuries. The only injuries for the month were during two practice crashes. Mario Andretti suffered burns to his face, and Sammy Sessions, who suffered a fractured knee cap. Al Unser actually suffered the most serious injury of the month, when he crashed his personal motorcycle in the infield. He suffered a broken leg the night before time trials was to begin, and had to sit out the race. Bud Tingelstad served as his replacement in the Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing entry.\nThe car in which Andretti won the 1969 Indy 500 is owned by the Smithsonian, while a replica made from the original blueprints sits on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum.\nRule changes.\nFor 1969, not a single front-engined car managed to qualify for the race, and ultimately, one would never do so again. All 33 cars in the field were rear-engined piston-powered machines. After the famous near-miss failures of the controversial STP Granatelli Turbine machines in 1967 and 1968, USAC imposed additional restrictions that effectively rendered them uncompetitive. The annulus inlet was further reduced from 15.999 in2 to 11.999 in2, and the Granatelli team abandoned the project. USAC stopped short of an outright ban on turbine cars, and it was not last time one would be entered. However, a turbine car would never manage to qualify for the race again.\nBy 1969, USAC had slowly begun to relax the rules regarding wings. While bolt-on wings were still not allowed, similar devices such as airfoils and spoilers were permitted, as long as they were an integral part of the bodywork. Several cars arrived at the track with a myriad of aerodynamic devices.\nGoodyear arrived at the track in 1969 with a new, low-profile, wider tire.\nRace schedule.\nThe 1969 race was the most recent Indy 500 scheduled for a Friday; the Uniform Monday Holiday Act was implemented in 1971 and Memorial Day became a three-day holiday weekend (Saturday–Monday) annually. Only one other subsequent year (1973) would the race be scheduled for a weekday. In 1970–1972, the race was scheduled for a Saturday, and beginning in 1974, the race has been scheduled for a Sunday.\nPractice and time trials.\nThe track opened on May 1 to light activity for the first few days. By Tuesday May 6, activity had picked up, and the top drivers were lapping in the 165 mph range. On Wednesday May 7, A. J. Foyt turned a lap of 169.237 mph, establishing himself as the top driver during the first week of practice.\nDuring the second week of practice, Mario Andretti took over the speed chart. On Monday May 12, he ran a lap of 170.197 mph, then followed it up on Wednesday May 14 with a lap of 171.657 mph. Al Unser was close behind with a lap of 169.141 mph.\nOn Thursday May 15, A. J. Foyt joined the \"170 mph\" club with a lap of 170.875 mph. By the end of the week, three drivers were over 170. Roger McCluskey posed a 170.283 mph on Friday May 16, the day before time trials was scheduled to begin. Through two weeks, though, no drivers had topped Joe Leonard's track record of 171.959 mph set in 1968.\nSaturday May 17 – Jigger Sirois.\nPole day was scheduled for Saturday May 17 from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. However, rain threatened to wash out the afternoon. At the time, the qualifying rules were a bit unclear and they did not necessarily provide extensions or provisions in case of a rain delay or a rain stoppage during the pole position round. Only cars that made an attempt before the rains came (and before the track was scheduled to close at 6 o'clock) might be eligible for the pole position. Rookie Leon Duray \"Jigger\" Sirois drew the #1 spot in the qualifying order.\nAt 4:12 p.m., the track was dry and finally opened for qualifying. Sirois took to the track for his first (of three allotted) qualifying attempt. He completed his first three laps at:\nHowever, on his fourth and final lap, his pit crew - seemingly dissatisfied with the run thus far - displayed the yellow flag and waved off the run, and it was aborted. Arnie Knepper was the second car in line, and pulled away for his warm up laps. Rain began to fall again before Knepper even saw the green flag. The track closed for the day.\nThat evening, Al Unser Sr., who had won the season opener at Phoenix, took to the infield to pass the time during the rain delay. He climbed on his motorcycle, and started riding around. In a small jump over a ditch, he toppled and the kickstand came down and pierced his left leg. He suffered a compound fracture to his left tibia, and was taken to the hospital. Unser was put in a cast, and was sidelined for a month and a half.\nSunday May 18.\nRain washed out time trials for the second day in a row. It was the first time in modern history that the entire first weekend of time trials was lost due to rain. Pole day was rescheduled for Saturday May 24.\nAt 1:04 p.m., a few cars make it out on the track for practice, but that lasted for only 18 minutes. Heavy rain and a tornado watch in the area closed the track for the day.\nIt was quickly noticed by media and fans that had Jigger Sirois' crew not waved off his final lap on Saturday, he would have been the lone qualifier of the weekend and sat on the coveted provisional pole position for at least an entire week.\nSaturday May 24.\nAfter 23 days of waiting, and two rainouts, the field was finally ready to begin time trials. On Wednesday May 21, pole favorite Mario Andretti suffered a serious crash in turn four during a practice run. He suffered burns to his face, but no other serious injuries. His four-wheel drive Lotus machine was destroyed, and Andretti would have to qualify a back-up car.\nA. J. Foyt won the pole position with a speed of 170.568 mph. A total of 25 cars completed runs. After his practice crash, Mario Andretti qualified the Brawner-Hawk for the middle of row one. Due to his facial burns, Mario asked his twin brother Aldo to stand in for him during the traditional front row photo session.\nThe news of Foyt winning the pole was relayed to the astronauts on Apollo 10.\nSunday May 25.\nThe field was filled to 33 cars with two cars bumped. For the first time in modern history, the field lined up coincidentally by speed from top-to-bottom.\nOn the second weekend of time trials, Jigger Sirois waved off his second attempt, and also waved off his third and final attempt when his speed was not fast enough. As it ended up, Sirois's first attempt on May 17 would have been fast enough to qualify for the race and possibly, depending on interpretation of the rules, the pole position. Sirois never managed to qualify at Indy in subsequent years, and became a source of popular folklore.\nRace recap.\nStart.\nOn the grid, LeeRoy Yarbrough's car failed to start, and the field pulled away, leaving him behind. On the pace lap, Yarbrough was able to get his car cranked, and frantically charged to catch up to the pack. He jockeyed to find his rightful starting position in row three, but managed only to make it mid-pack as the field took the green flag. Going into turn one, Mario Andretti took the lead from the middle of the front row, with polesitter A. J. Foyt following in second. Bruce Walkup, meanwhile, was out on the first lap with a transmission failure.\nFirst half.\nAndretti led the first five laps, then Foyt took the lead going into turn one. One of the weaknesses of the turbocharged Fords used by Andretti (and several other top drivers) was overheating. So Andretti eased slightly and Foyt took over. Foyt would lead for 66 laps in the first half. The early stages of the race saw heavy attrition and a series of unscheduled pit stops. Several cars were out before lap 30, including Art Pollard, Ronnie Bucknum, Johnny Rutherford, and Jim McElreath, who had a fire as the car went down into turn one. McElreath was able to stop the car in turn 1 and got out uninjured, bringing out the first of only two yellow light periods. Retiring to the pits early was Gordon Johncock and Bobby Unser, as well as Jack Brabham, whose Repco engine would eventually suffer ignition failure.\nThe second of two yellow light periods came out on lap 87 when Arnie Knepper broke a suspension piece, causing him to crash in turn 4. He hit the outside wall and came to rest near the entrance to the pit area. Wally Dallenbach spun under the yellow and dropped out with a bad clutch.\nOn lap 99, A. J. Foyt headed to the pits with a split manifold. He spent over twenty minutes in the pits as the team made repairs. However, he did return to the race. With the Foyt team scrambling to diagnose A.J.'s troubles, the team neglected to signal George Snider to the pits, and Snider ran out of fuel on the track. Snider was eventually pushed back to the pits and rejoined the race, but he lost a considerable number of laps.\nIn the first half, Andy Granatelli's three-car effort was down to one as both Art Pollard and Carl Williams were out early. Mario Andretti was the only Granatelli car still running. After years of disappointment, including the frustrations of the turbines the past two years, Andretti was still in position to finally give Granatelli his first 500 victory.\nSecond half.\nAfter leading ten laps up to that point, Lloyd Ruby went into the pits on lap 105. As the team was refueling the car, Ruby started to pull away too soon, with the hose still attached. A large hole was ruptured in the side of the fuel tank, and all the fuel spilled out onto the pavement. Ruby was out of the race, leaving Mario Andretti alone in front.\nOn lap 150, Joe Leonard was black-flagged for leaking fluid. He made a long pit stop to replace a punctured radiator, returned to the race, and managed a 6th-place finish. A. J. Foyt, after returning from repairs, was now among the fastest cars on the track. His hard charging second half saw him finish in 8th place.\nMario Andretti dominated the second half, and won comfortably over second place Dan Gurney. But Andretti's race was not without incident. On one occasion, he nearly hit the wall in turn two. On his final pit stop, he knocked over chief mechanic Clint Brawner, and nearly stalled the engine as he was pushed away. His transmission fluid was low, the clutch was reportedly slipping, and despite an extra radiator added by Brawner behind the driver's seat after qualifying, engine temperature was running high. Despite the complications, Andretti maintained over a full-lap lead late in the race and cruised to victory.\nCar owner Andy Granatelli, who abandoned the turbine cars after the heartbreaks of 1967 and 1968, planted a famous kiss on Andretti's cheek in victory lane. There were no yellow lights during the second half, and the final 110 laps were run under green. Andretti ran the whole race without changing tires.\nIn victory lane, an emotional happy Mario stated:\n\"I wanted to win this race so bad that you can't believe it. I will be having to pinch myself for the rest of the night. I am happy for Andy and STP. This is my biggest win and it's awesome.\"\nBox score.\nThe top four racers were allowed to complete the entire 500 mile race distance. Eight additional cars were running as of the race finish, but were flagged off the track not having completed the entire distance. Andretti's race completion time of 3:11:14.71 was the fastest ever as of 1969.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer and Len Sutton served as \"driver expert.\" At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. The broadcast came on-air with a 30-minute pre-race.\nThe broadcast was carried on over 950 affiliates, including AFN, shortwave to troops in Vietnam, and the CBC. Foreign language translations were made in French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The broadcast was also carried in Mexico City on XEVIB.

        "text": "The 51st International 500 Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, over two days, Tuesday May 30 and Wednesday May 31, 1967. The race was dominated by Parnelli Jones in the radically new, four-wheel drive STP-Paxton Turbocar gas turbine entered by prolific car owner Andy Granatelli. With three laps to go, however, Jones coasted to a stop when a $6 transmission bearing failed. A. J. Foyt assumed the lead, and weaved his way through a pileup on the final lap, to win his third Indy 500 victory.\nFoyt's victory was the first Indy 500 win for Goodyear tires since 1919. After leaving the sport in 1922, Goodyear returned to the sport in 1964, and in 1967, snapped Firestone's record of 43 consecutive Indy 500 wins.\nThe race was scheduled for Tuesday May 30. The race started on time at 11:00 a.m. EST, but after only 18 laps, rain began to fall. The race was red-flagged, and the resumption was held at 10:00 a.m. the following day. Though temperatures on Wednesday were cool, skies were sunny, and the race was run to completion.\nRace schedule.\nThe annual 500 Victory Banquet was scheduled for Wednesday May 31. After the race was postponed for rain, the banquet was still held as scheduled, which was just hours after the checkered flag fell.\nTime trials.\nPole day – Saturday May 13.\nGoing into time trials, Mario Andretti was the favorite for the pole position. On the final day of practice, he turned the fastest practice lap in Indy history at over 168 mph. Among the others that were expected to challenge for the front row were Roger McCluskey, A. J. Foyt, and Gordon Johncock. Parnelli Jones, driving the new Granatelli STP-Paxton Turbocar gas turbine was in the top ten of practice speeds, but never on top, and some in the garage area were accusing the team of sandbagging.\nThe first car out to qualify was Ronnie Duman. At about 2:30 p.m., Joe Leonard took over the provisional pole position with a run of 166.098 mph, a new track record. About an hour and a half later, Dan Gurney took over the pole with another record run of 167.224 mph. Gurney's time on top was short-lived, however, as Mario Andretti was the next car to make an attempt. Andretti set new 1-lap and 4-lap track records to win the pole position for the second year in a row. His third lap (169.779 mph) stood as the single lap record, and his four-lap average wound up at 168.982 mph.\nAt the end of the day, the field was filled to 25 cars. Later in the day, Gordon Johncock (166.559 mph) squeezed himself on to the front row, qualifying third. A. J. Foyt suffered mechanical trouble on his first attempt, and pulled off the course. Later on, he returned to the track to qualify in fourth starting position. Parnelli Jones in the Granatelli Turbine qualified 6th. As was noted by many other teams at the time, Jones qualified with a race day set-up, while the piston-powered entries practiced and qualified with \"qualifying setups,\" including light fuel loads, lightened transmission components, higher-revving gear ratios, a percentage of \"pop,\" or nitromethane in the fuel, and so on. The STP crew had Jones qualify with a straight race-day setup, including the use of standard fuel (aircraft-grade kerosene, in this case).\nSecond day – Sunday May 14.\nThe second day of time trials was rained out.\nThird day – Saturday May 20.\nThe field filled to 33 cars after 23 attempts were made. Six cars were bumped including Jackie Stewart. Roger McCluskey, who was not able to qualify on pole day, was the fastest car of the afternoon (165.563 mph).\nBump day – Sunday May 21.\nGraham Hill and Jackie Stewart successfully bumped their way into the field. Jim Hurtubise tried to qualify using a front-engined car, but he was too slow.\nRace summary.\nStart (Tuesday).\nThe race started on Tuesday May 30 under threatening skies. At the start, polesitter Mario Andretti briefly took the lead into turn one. However, Jones swept to the outside from 6th starting position, and passed four cars in turn one. Exiting turn two, he dove below Andretti and took the lead down the backstretch. Jones ran the first lap at a record 154 mph, and started pulling out to a sizable lead.\nOn lap 3, LeeRoy Yarbrough spun in turn four, briefly bringing out the yellow. His car was not damaged, and he continued. After only a few laps, Mario Andretti pulled into the pits with mechanical troubles. The crew went to work on the car. On lap 18, rain began to fall, and the yellow light came on with Jones leading. On the 19th lap, the red flag came out and the race was halted at approximately 11:16 am. The rain continued most of the afternoon, and at about 4:15 p.m., officials postponed the conclusion until the next day. Scoring reverted to the completion of the 18th lap, and all cars were eligible for the resumption except Lloyd Ruby, who had already wheeled his car back to the garage with broken valves.\nRestart (Wednesday).\nWednesday May 31 dawned cool but sunny and the race was resumed at 10:00 a.m. local time. George Snider fell ill overnight with a cold, and Lloyd Ruby, who had dropped out the day earlier, took over his car in relief for Wednesday. Two unscored warm-up laps were run behind the pace car, and the field of now 32 cars took the green flag to restart single-file. Jones continued where he left off and led on what was now the 19th lap.\nFirst half.\nOn lap 52, LeeRoy Yarbrough suffered his second spin in turn four in two days. This time he tangled with the leader Parnelli Jones. Jones went low to lap Yarbrough, but was pinched down on the apron and the two cars touched wheels. Both cars went spinning into the grass, but they were not damaged and both drivers drove away unscathed. Dan Gurney briefly took the lead after the incident, but gave it up after only two laps when he pitted.\nThe first half shaped up with Jones dominating in the Turbine, chased by Dan Gurney, A. J. Foyt, and Al Unser, Sr., among others. On the leader's 65th lap, Mario Andretti lost a wheel in the exit of turn one. He came a stop in turn two and was out of the race with only 59 laps completed.\nOn his first pit stop on lap 80, Parnelli Jones escaped possible disaster as he began to pull away before the fuel hose was disengaged. The hose jerked and caused a spill, but Jones pulled away without damage and without a fire breaking out. A. J. Foyt slipped by to take the lead. Four laps later Foyt handed the lead back to Jones when he himself pitted.\nSeveral cars were involved in a quick succession of crashes around the midway point. Art Pollard spun in turn three, but continued. Moments later, Carl Williams spun in front of Bob Veith as they diced through traffic in turn three. Veith's car suffered major damage to the nose, but both drivers were able to continue. Under the same yellow light, Wally Dallenbach wrecked into the inside wall of the mainstretch. Moments later, Cale Yarborough spun out in the north chute. Approaching the scene, Lloyd Ruby (in George Snider's car) spun out with LeeRoy Yarbrough, and both cars went sliding to the infield grass in turn four. Ruby's car hit the inside fence and was out. LeeRoy Yarbrough, after his third spin of the race, was also out. Cale Yarborough, however, got back in his car and continued. About three laps later, Johnny Rutherford wrecked on his own in turn two.\nSecond half.\nParnelli Jones continued to dominate the race, but gave up the lead to A. J. Foyt for laps 131–149. Dan Gurney, a contender in the first half, dropped out on lap 160.\nArnie Knepper (engine), Jackie Stewart (engine), Cale Yarborough and Mel Kenyon (crash), all dropped out of the race. Jochen Rindt, who experienced a difficult month and a difficult race, dropped out with a broken valve. Rindt, apparently not impressed with the Speedway, said he was not interested in coming back, but he did return one additional time in 1968.\nWith about 7 laps left for the leaders, Gordon Johncock spun out, briefly bringing out the yellow. At this point, Parnelli Jones seemingly had the race wrapped up, holding nearly a full lap lead over second place A. J. Foyt. Third place Al Unser was more than two laps down. Shockingly, with only four laps to go, a $6 transmission bearing failed, and the Turbine quietly coasted to a stop near the entrance to pit lane. The STP Granatelli team was in disbelief as they ran to the car's aid.\nA. J. Foyt drove by into first place with only four laps to go, but the drama was not yet over. On the final lap, Foyt was driving through turn four when a four-car crash broke out at the north end of the main straightaway. Foyt had a premonition of trouble (he later suggested that he had subconsciously noticed the crowd looking down the straightaway instead of at him) and backed off, and with savvy driving, weaved his way through the wreckage. He avoided the spinning cars and debris and took the checkered flag for his third win at Indianapolis. Foyt's winning speed of was a new record. The red and checkered flags immediately halted the race. Al Unser finished in second place for the first of three times in his career.\nBox score.\nNote: George Snider completed laps 1–16 on Tuesday, but fell ill and was relieved by Lloyd Ruby on Wednesday for laps 17–99\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer for the 16th year. It was Collins' 20th year overall with the crew. Len Sutton served as \"driver expert\" for the second year. At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane.\nThe entire on-air crew remained consistent from 1966. The broadcast reached over 900 affiliates including Armed Forces Network, the CBC, and shortwave to Vietnam. The broadcast had an estimated 100 million listeners worldwide. The original broadcast on Tuesday May 30 came on air at 10:30 a.m. local time and was scheduled for four and a half hours, including a 30-minute pre-race segment. When the race was red flagged for rain, the network signed off at 11:45 a.m., and returned for brief weather updates at 12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m., 1:15 p.m., 2:15 p.m., 3:15 p.m., 3:45 p.m., and 4:15 p.m., at which time the race was officially postponed. During the rain delay on Tuesday, guests to the booth included J. C. Agajanian, Rory Calhoun, as well as Lorne Greene and Michael Landon, both from the TV series \"Bonanza\". Greene and Landon had been grand marshals for the 500 Festival Parade.\nOn Wednesday May 31, the broadcast came on air at 9:45 a.m. local time, leading up to the 10:00 a.m. resumption. All of the announcers and reporters from Tuesday returned to their assignments for Wednesday. Booth guests on Wednesday included Pete DePaolo, Jim Murray, Tom Harmon, and 500 Festival queen Janice Cruze Bretz. During the post-race, Sid Collins was presented with a Resolution passed by the California State Legislature from State Senator George Deukmejian and Lt. Governor Bob Finch honoring Collins' twentieth year serving on the network.\nFor 1967, the flagship station changed from WIBC to WTHI in Terre Haute.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\". The broadcast aired on Saturday June 10. Jim McKay anchored the telecast for the first time, with analysts Rodger Ward and pit work from Chris Economaki. The opening featured a brief recap of time trials, followed by edited race coverage.\nThe broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic starting in May 2011.\nThe race was shown live on MCA closed-circuit television in approximately 150-175 theaters and venues across the United States. Charlie Brockman served as anchor. The feed was transmitted internationally to Europe utilizing the \"Early Bird\" satellite, and to Japan using the \"Lani Bird\" satellite. Due to the rain delay, coverage was not available to international viewers on Wednesday. Viewers at U.S. venues were able to watch the second day of coverage with rain checks.\nGallery.\nNOTE: The revolutionary #40 STP Turbine in the photo taken in the Speedway Museum is actually a replica built from the blueprints (as is the replica of Parnelli Jones' 1963 #98 Indy 500-winning car): The actual #40 is in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History."

        "text": "The 50th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Monday, May 30, 1966. The official program cover for the race celebrated both the 50th running of the race, and 150th anniversary of Indiana statehood.\nEleven of the 33 starters were eliminated in a first-lap accident right after receiving the green flag on the main stretch. Only A. J. Foyt was injured, hurting his hand scaling the catch fence trying to escape the wreck scene. Only seven cars, the fewest finishers ever, were still running by the end of the race. First-time starter Jackie Stewart led by over a lap late in the race in John Mecom's Lola T90-Ford. However, inside ten laps to go, his oil pressure dropped too low due to a broken scavenge pump. Stewart parked the car, and after briefly attempting to push some ways, he walked back to the pits. Fellow rookie Graham Hill inherited the lead and led a total of 10 laps to win, the first rookie winner since 1927. Despite parking the car, Stewart was voted the rookie of the year over Hill, completing enough laps to finish in 6th place.\nDefending race winner Jim Clark spun twice during the race, and finished second. For the second year in a row, the Wood Brothers from the NASCAR Grand National circuit were invited to work pit stops, this time for Dan Gurney. However, the car dropped out of the race in the crash on the opening lap.\nPractice and time trials.\nBackground.\nThree-year veteran Johnny Rutherford was injured in a serious crash on April 3 at Eldora, and was forced to sit out the 1966 race.\nThe Mecom Racing Team was scheduled to field drivers Walt Hansgen, Rodger Ward, and Jackie Stewart. However, Hansgen died from injuries suffered in a crash during a test session at Le Mans on April 3. Graham Hill was named as a late replacement, and his name was not even listed on the entry list in the official program.\nPractice.\nPractice for the \"Golden Anniversary 500\" opened on Saturday April 30, but cold temperatures and rainy weather for the first few days kept most cars off the track. Chuck Hulse (149.8 mph) was the fastest car over the first weekend. On Monday May 2, Art Pollard became the first rookie to pass the 145 mph rookie test. Jackie Stewart also passed his rookie test.\nOn Tuesday May 10, Mario Andretti turned a practice lap of 164.5 mph during practice, establishing himself as an early favorite for the pole position. Among the others over the 160 mph mark were A. J. Foyt, George Snider, and Dan Gurney.\nRain washed out practice on Wednesday May 11.\nOn Friday May 13, the final day of practice before time trials, Mario Andretti shattered the unofficial track record by more than 5 mph, running a lap of 167.411 mph. Rain hampered most of the day, but Andretti put together additional laps of 166 mph, and 164 mph. The next-fastest car was Jim Clark, whose best lap was 165.7 mph.\nSaturday May 14 – Pole Day time trials.\nMario Andretti won the pole position with a four-lap track record of 165.889 mph. His best single lap was a record 166.328 mph.\nChuck Rodee was killed in a crash. On his second warmup lap in turn one, Rodee backed into the outside wall, and he died of his injuries at the hospital.\nA total of 18 cars completed qualifying runs on a chilly pole day.\nSunday May 15 – Second Day Time trials.\nAfter crashing on pole day, A. J. Foyt qualified at 161.355 mph, the fourth-fastest car in the field.\nSaturday May 21 – Third Day Time trials.\nUnser brothers Bobby and Al qualified, with rookie Al (162.272 mph) leading the speeds for the day. Bobby Grim qualified his turbo Offy front-engined roadster at 158.367 mph, the only such car in the field.\nSunday May 22 – Bump Day Time trials.\nTwo drivers managed to bump their way into the field, Ronnie Duman and Larry Dickson. Greg Weld wrecked two cars (one of which was a popular Granatelli-Novi), but was uninjured. Bobby Grim, the slowest qualifier, holds on to the make the field in his front-engined roadster.\nRace recap.\nStart.\nAs the field came down the main stretch for the start, Billy Foster was among those jockeying for position. As the green flag fell, he nearly touched wheels with Gordon Johncock and lost control. He spun directly into the outside wall, just beyond the start/finish line, and triggered a huge pileup. Sixteen cars were involved, with debris and loose wheels bouncing all over the racing surface.\nAs the drivers instinctively scurried out of their machines to avoid possible flames (although no significant fires had broken out), A. J. Foyt became the only driver casualty of the incident. He injured his hand climbing over the catch fence on the outside of the track. He was checked out at the infield hospital, and cleared to drive relief if needed. One spectator was hit by a wheel from the crash.\nOf the sixteen cars, eleven were damaged beyond repair. The red flag came out, and after the cleanup, the race lined up for a restart with only 22 cars. The red flag delay was about 1 hour and 24 minutes.\nWhen the race was restarted, the field took several warm up laps, and restarted single file. The yellow light came back on almost immediately when Johnny Boyd crashed in turn 1 on the first green lap.\nRace.\nThe early half of the race was dominated by Lloyd Ruby, who was seeking his first win in the Indianapolis 500. However, a bad pit stop resulted in Ruby losing a couple of laps and he went on to finish 11th. Jackie Stewart dominated the second half of the race, leading 40 laps. Stewart was leading by a little over a lap before his car broke with 10 laps to go. Graham Hill inherited the lead, led the final laps, and won the race. His original margin of victory was 42 seconds over second place, Jim Clark, pending the final results.\nControversy.\nDuring the race, confusion broke out over the running order, which resulted in people being unsure, even to this day, on who won the race. The confusion in the scoring led to a controversy, wherein second place Jim Clark's team thought they were the rightful winner. Clark had spun on two separate occasions during the race, but did not make serious contact during either incident. He did not stall his engine either time, and was able to drive to the pits for the crew to inspect the car quickly both times. Clark's team contended that he did not lose a significant amount of track position, and estimated that they were still one lap ahead of Graham Hill at the finish. The scoring pylon, which was manually controlled and unofficial, changed frequently and somewhat sporadically as the scoring was ironed out, much to the dismay of Clark's crew in particular, and much to the confusion of spectators. The unofficial results at the conclusion of the race showed Graham Hill winning by 41.13 seconds over Clark.\nThe morning after the race, USAC released the official results, and the standings were unchanged. Colin Chapman and Andy Granatelli, the entrants of Clark's Lotus team, declined to file an official protest. A possible explanation given was that the Lotus crew did not see Hill pass by Clark during the aftermath of the second spin.\nRace winner Graham Hill admitted to having an \"uneventful race\", being \"puzzled\" and \"surprised\" to be the winner, while other unsatisfied competitors quipped that he had \"never passed a car all day long.\" The IMS Radio Network, which scored the race independently from the USAC officials, also came up with Hill as the first place car. The apparent controversy died out quickly, and no official action was ever taken. Years later the subject is still mildly debated in racing circles.\nA theory emerged that scorers accidentally omitted one lap from Jim Clark's official tally. Therefore, he was effectively placed behind Hill at the finish. The car of Al Unser was painted nearly identical to Clark's. The theory is that when Al Unser crashed out of the race on lap 161, scorers mistakenly thought it was Clark, and as Clark drove by in the immediate aftermath, they credited that lap to Unser by mistake. Another version of the theory suggests an opposite situation - one of Unser's laps was erroneously credited to Clark's tally early on, and when the scoring serials were compiled and settled later in the race, the extra lap was correctly deleted.\nAlongside the controversy between Hill and Clark, fourth place Gordon Johncock is also theorized by some observers to have actually been the rightful winner of the race. Johncock completed the 500 miles in less elapsed time than Hill, Clark, and third place Jim McElreath. However, Johncock had suffered minor damage during the first lap accident, and restarted the race in the pit lane due to the crew changing the nose cone. USAC officials did not score his first lap out of the pit lane, and he effectively ran all day carrying a one lap penalty to the field.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. Len Sutton joined the crew, serving as \"driver expert,\" replacing Fred Agabashian. The network had gained sponsorship from Autolite, but Agabashian worked for Champion, and he considered it a conflict of interest, so he stepped aside. He would eventually return to the network in 1973–77. At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. The broadcast was scheduled for four and a half hours (including a 30-minute pre-race), but the red flag delay at the start extended it.\nThe broadcast was carried on over 725 affiliates in all 50 states, and 850 stations worldwide including shortwave transmissions from New York and Los Angeles, and XEVIP in Mexico City. Through Armed Forces Network, the broadcast reached worldwide to locations including Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Saigon, Okinowa, Philippines, England, Spain, the Azores, Italy, France, Germany, Turkey, Greece, Pakistan, Morocco, Libya, Newfoundland, Iceland, Labrador, Greenland, and both the North and South poles. In the Indianapolis area, nearly every major radio station simulcast the broadcast. The race was heard by an estimated 100 million listeners.\nBill Frosh, who had reported from turn one for over a decade, left the on-air crew, working instead in production. Mike Ahern took over the prestigious turn one position. Newcomer Doug Zink took the backstretch location, while second-year member Ron Carrell moved to turn three.\nThe off-air, two-man serial scoring team of Bill Fleetemeyer and Bill Lamb were commended for their contributions to the broadcast. During this era, the radio network crew typically facilitated its own team of unofficial serial scorers to track the progress of the race. That allowed the scoring reports to be announced on-air faster than the official USAC scorekeepers could produce them from race control. Despite the controversy over the scoring between winner Graham Hill and second place Jim Clark, Fleetemeyer and Lamb also came up with Hill as the first place car.\nFor 1967, the flagship station changed from WIBC to WTHI in Terre Haute. Guests in the booth during the red flag delay included Peter DePaolo, Cesar Romero, Johnnie Parsons, Wally Parks, Lucy Foyt, Phil Harris, General Howdy Wilcox, and Larry Bisceglia. During the race, guests that stopped by included Walt Arfons, Frank Borman, Al Bloemker, Louis Meyer, Mickey Thompson, J. C. Agajanian, and Duke Nalon. Senator Birch Bayh visited the booth, accompanied by Wyoming Senator Gale W. McGee and Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman.\nAs a gesture celebrating the network's 15th anniversary, as well as the 50th running of the 500, guests were presented with a commemorative gold filled Zippo lighter. One station, KXO in California, was noted and recognized as being one of the few original affiliates to carry the race all fifteen years since the network's inception.\nTelevision.\nThe race was shown live on MCA closed-circuit television in nearly 200 theaters across the United States. Charlie Brockman served as anchor. For the first time, the feed was transmitted internationally to Europe utilizing the \"Early Bird\" satellite. A short video clip showing the restart after the first-lap accident, and a longer clip of the last 55 laps of the race, both synchronized to audio from the IMS Radio broadcast, have been posted on YouTube.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\". The broadcast aired on Saturday June 4. Chris Schenkel anchored the telecast for the first time. Much of the video was culled from the live closed-circuit color telecast of the race."

        "text": "The 48th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Saturday, May 30, 1964. The race was won by A. J. Foyt, but is primarily remembered for a fiery seven-car accident which resulted in the deaths of racers Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald. It is also the last race won by a front-engined \"roadster\", as all subsequent races have been won by rear-engined, formula-style cars. It was Foyt's second of four Indy 500 victories.\nJim Clark, who finished second the previous year, won the pole position in the Lotus 34 quad-cam Ford V-8. He took the lead at the start, and led for a total of 14 laps. However, a tire failure caused a broken suspension, and he dropped out on lap 47. Team manager Colin Chapman had chosen special soft-compound Dunlop tires for qualifying, and the rules dictated that the same type of tires be used for the race, where they suffered from a high wear rate. Clark's Lotus teammate Dan Gurney was later pulled from the race after experiencing similar tire wear.\nBobby Marshman led during the early stages of the race, at one point stretching his lead to as much as 90 seconds. During his aggressive charge in front, he became uncharacteristically obsessed with putting A. J. Foyt a lap down. On lap 39, he went too low in turn one, bottoming out the car, and dropped out with a broken transmission oil plug. Defending race champion Parnelli Jones later dropped out after a his car caught fire after he exited his pit box, crashing it into the outside pit wall. With Marshman, Clark, and Jones all out of the race, A. J. Foyt cruised to victory, leading the final 146 laps.\nRace winner Foyt drove the whole 500 miles without changing tires. Goodyear supplied tires for some entries, but participated only in practice. No cars used Goodyear tires during the race itself. Foyt's 1964 winning car remains the only car in the collection of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame and Museum, regularly on display, that has never been restored to pre race condition.\nTime trials.\nTime trials were scheduled for four days.\nSachs/MacDonald crash.\n\"Sears-Allstate Special\".\nDave MacDonald was driving a car owned and designed by Mickey Thompson, the #83 \"Sears-Allstate Special\". It was a rear-engined car that first raced in 1963, updated with a streamlined body for 1964. The car utilized Allstate tires, manufactured by Armstrong Tire and Rubber Co. Due to rule changes by USAC for 1964, the car was required to utilize tires (it previously used ones). The wheels were most notably enclosed in the front and the rear by streamlined bodywork, intended to take advantage of aerodynamic effects to increase top speeds. However, it is believed that the wheel encasements, as well as the bodywork in general, made the car difficult to handle.\nThe fuel tanks were located in the sidepods of the car surrounding the cockpit, and held exactly 75 gallons of fuel, per race USAC rules as published in the race programs sold trackside. The tanks each had a single bladder installed by the late Dave Zieger, in a fiberglass shell supported by the fill neck and a molded fiberglass body housing and a flat thin magnesium plate beneath the tank, braced by two steel straps hanging from the top rails of the frame. Following the crash, numerous erroneous accounts described the tanks as oversized, some claiming they held upwards of . An urban legend circulated that Thompson was boasting plans to drive the entire 500 miles without a pit stop, using an oversized fuel tank, but this has been proven false. The crashworthiness of the car and the fuel cell was brought into question at the time.\nPractice and qualifying.\nDuring practice, it was discovered immediately that the car's handling was seriously flawed. Masten Gregory complained that aerodynamic lift reduced the steering response. Gregory suffered a crash on May 6, and quit the team due to what he believed was a terribly-handling car.\nDave MacDonald managed to qualify his car without incident. Eddie Johnson qualified the second team car. On Carburetion Day, MacDonald tested the car, with conflicting accounts on whether he ever drove with a full load of fuel. Other drivers in the paddock were known to be concerned about the car, and at least one account claimed that 1963 pole winner and reigning Formula One World Champion Jim Clark advised MacDonald to get out of the car. Another Formula One driver and future Indy 500 winner Graham Hill had actually tested the car at the speedway in 1963 but had refused to drive it because of its bad handling.\nCrash.\nOn the first lap, MacDonald passed at least five other cars. As he passed Johnny Rutherford and Sachs, Rutherford noticed MacDonald's car was handling poorly, zig-zagging, and throwing grass and dirt up from the edge of the track. Rutherford later said, watching the behavior of MacDonald's car, he thought, \"he's either gonna win this thing or crash.\" Eyewitness accounts and film footage are inconsistent about the exact details of MacDonald's first two laps, but it is generally agreed he was attempting to pass many cars.\nOn the second lap, MacDonald's car spun coming off turn four, as he was turning down below the groove to pass Jim Hurtubise and Walt Hansgen. The car slid across the track and hit the inside wall, igniting the gasoline in the tank and resulting in a massive fire. His car then slid back across the track, causing seven more cars to be involved. Ronnie Duman crashed, spun in flames and hit the pit lane wall, and was burned. Bobby Unser hit Duman's car from behind, and Johnny Rutherford's car on its left rear tire, and crashed into the outside wall. Chuck Stevenson and Norm Hall also crashed.\nSachs aimed for an opening along the outside wall, but MacDonald's burning car slid into his path. Sachs hit MacDonald's car broadside, causing a second explosion; Sachs died instantly, although it remains unknown if he died of blunt force trauma or incendiary injuries. Despite Sachs's body being trapped in the burning car, his driver's suit was only scorched and he received burns on his face and hands. The car was covered with a tarp before being towed to the garage area for removal of his body. A lemon that had been on a string around Sachs's neck was found inside Rutherford's engine compartment after the crash.\nMacDonald was pulled from the wreckage and taken into the infield hospital. Although very badly burned, he was alive. His lungs were seared from flame inhalation, causing acute pulmonary edema. He died at 13:20 after being taken to Methodist Hospital.\nThe crash was well documented in film and still images, and shown worldwide. For the first time in its history, the Indianapolis 500 was stopped because of an accident. Partially in response to media pressure, USAC mandated cars carry less fuel (and crafted the rules to effectively eliminate the use of gasoline, effective for the 1965 season). This resulted in a change to methanol fuel, with a switch to ethanol starting in 2006, although gasoline returned in 2012 with the introduction of the current E85 formula of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Another response to the crash was the 1965 introduction of the Firestone \"RaceSafe\" fuel cell, with technology used in military helicopters.\nThe Sachs/MacDonald crash came just six days after the fiery crash of Fireball Roberts at the World 600. Roberts would succumb on July 2. The sense of gloom within the American racing community was further compounded when, just a week after the tragedy at Indianapolis, popular driver Jim Hurtubise was critically burned at Milwaukee.\n2016 reunion.\nThe crash deeply disturbed the MacDonald family. Members of MacDonald's family avoided visiting the Speedway. Closure was not met until son Rich MacDonald began researching his father's career, with the DaveMacDonald.net Web domain since 2003 a tribute to his father's accomplishments and a family diary to the modern era, meeting Sachs's son Edward Julius III (known as Eddie Jr) on social media. Curt Cavin, an \"Indianapolis Star\" reporter, was able to contact MacDonald first, and shortly afterwards, contacted Sachs. Along with other contacts, most notably Angela Savage, daughter of Swede Savage, killed in the 1973 race, whose first visit to the 500 was celebrated in 2014 and has become an annual visit, the MacDonalds were able to meet at the Speedway again.\nAt the 2016 Indianapolis 500, Sherry MacDonald, Dave's widow and son Rich MacDonald appeared for race day, and were joined by Eddie Sachs III. All three took a photo near the site of the fatal crash, the wall which had been heightened and where track boxes had been removed in time for the 1974, that at the time was marked by the series fuel supplier sign behind the wall, which since 2000 has been the pit lane exit for clockwise road course events.\nEarlier in 2016, Rich MacDonald appeared in a podcast presented by Angela Savage, the posthumously born daughter of Swede (killed at the 1973 race), which struck a friendship between the two children of the fallen racers. Rich and Angela have appeared together at events.\nBox score.\nBeginning in 1964, the time allowed for drivers behind the winner to complete the 200-lap race distance was reduced to \"approximately five minutes of extra time\", whereas before 1964, several minutes might be granted for the purpose. This five-minute time allowance was allowed until 1974, after which all drivers were flagged off the track after the winner crossed the line.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nFor the first time ever, the race was shown live, flag-to-flag, on closed-circuit television in theater venues across the county. Charlie Brockman served as the anchor. A few minutes of filmed highlights appeared a week later on ABC's \"Wide World Of Sports\"\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. Fred Agabashian served as \"driver expert.\" Lou Palmer conducted the winner's interview in victory lane. The broadcast was carried by a record 558 affiliates in the United States. With the addition of WJAR-AM in Providence, Rhode Island, for the first time, the broadcast was carried by at least one affiliate originating in all 50 states. Previously, listeners in Rhode Island (and elsewhere) may have only been able to hear the broadcast from a signal from a neighboring state. The broadcast featured a 30-minute pre-race.\nBernie Herman departed the crew, and newcomer Chuck Marlowe was stationed at the backstretch location. During the broadcast, a young Donald Davidson visited the booth, and made a brief appearance for an interview. Charlie Brockman left the radio crew permanently in 1964 to take over anchoring the MCA closed-circuit television broadcast. John DeCamp joined the booth to serve as statistician. Other guests in the booth included Pete DePaolo, and Indiana Governor Matthew E. Welsh.\nEddie Sachs eulogy.\nDuring the live radio broadcast of the race, IMS Radio Network anchor Sid Collins drew critical praise for an impromptu on-air eulogy for Eddie Sachs. During the red flag, track public address announcer Tom Carnegie made the official announcement of the death of Sachs (MacDonald had not yet expired, and his death was not announced until later). The announcement was simulcast on the radio feed.\nSilence was heard on-air for about five seconds, and at that point, Collins chimed in with a solemn, unprepared eulogy:\nCollins received over 30,000 letters requesting a transcript of the eulogy. Rebroadcasts of the speech in subsequent years have generally omitted Collins's reference to Sachs's consecutive pole positions, due to his accidental misattribution of their being won a year later than they actually were, in 1960 and 1961."

        "text": "The 47th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Thursday, May 30, 1963. Rufus Parnelli Jones took his only Indy 500 win. This win was controversial because his car (nicknamed \"Calhoun\") spewed oil from a cracked overflow tank for many laps, which allegedly caused at least one driver to spin and crash. USAC officials put off black-flagging Jones after car owner J. C. Agajanian ran down pit lane and convinced them that the oil leak was below the level of a known crack and would not leak any further. Lotus owner Colin Chapman, whose English-built, rear-engined Lotus-Ford finished second in the hands of Scotsman Jim Clark, accused USAC officials of being biased in favor of the American driver and car.\nThe non-black flagging of Jones remains controversial. Many, including Chapman and writer Brock Yates, believed that officials would have black flagged Jones if an American driver and car had been in second place instead of Clark in the British built Lotus. Goodyear arrived at the track and supplied tires for some entries, but participated only in practice. No cars used Goodyear tires during time trials or the race itself. It was the first time since about 1921 that Goodyear attempted to compete at Indy. Goodyear had last won the race in 1919.\nTime trials.\nTime trials was scheduled for four days.\nRace details.\nStart.\nParnelli Jones started from the pole position, and at the start, led the field into turn one. A fierce duel broke out in the opening laps. Jim Hurtubise, who started in the middle of the front row, caught up to Jones down the backstretch, and passed him for the lead. Hurtubise led at the stripe at the completion of lap 1. On lap 2, Jones caught up to Hurtubise again, and took the lead back in turn four, and led lap 2. Hurtubise dove down to re-take the lead in turn one, but Jones was able to slip by and hold the position.\nOn lap 3, Bobby Unser swerved to avoid running into the car of Dick Rathmann. Unser spun out and crashed into the wall in turn one. The yellow light would stay on for nearly ten minutes to clean up a gasoline spill caused by the wreck. Jones continued to lead, and when the green flag came back out on lap 10, he pulled out to a sizable margin.\nFirst half.\nWith Jones ahead, Hurtubise was running second, holding off Roger McCluskey and Bobby Marshman in 3rd-4th. Hurtubise held off their challenge for many laps, his powerful Novi engine blasting down the long straights. By lap 40, however, McCluskey and Marshman finally got by Hurtubise. Jones was all alone though, ahead by over 20 seconds.\nOn lap 46, the yellow came out for a crash by Bud Tingelstad in turn two. At the same time, Allen Crowe lost a wheel and crashed in turn 1. Still under the caution light on lap 50, Jim McElreath and Bobby Marshman spun in the pit area. They avoided a major mishap and made no contact. They got to their pit stalls, and rejoined the race.\nLeader Parnelli Jones made his first pit stop on lap 62. As the other leaders pitted one by one, Jim Clark and Dan Gurney (driving the Lotus 29-Ford rear-engined machines) worked their way to the front of the field. The venerable front engine roadsters were expected to make 2–3 pits stops each, while the rear-engined Lotus machines were planning on only one pit stop for fuel. Tire wear was a concern for the heavy roadsters, but the Lotus team was hoping to go the whole way without changing any tires. Clark passed Roger McCluskey for the lead on lap 68.\nWith Clark and Gurney running 1st-2nd, Parnelli Jones was running third. Despite having already pitted, Jones remarkably was only about 18 seconds behind. The superior handling the rear-engined machines enjoyed in the corners was still somewhat trumped by the higher top speed the front-engined roadsters achieved down the long straights.\nIt was around lap 80 that observers began to see oil smoke intermittently trailing Parnelli Jones' car. Jim Clark made his lone scheduled pit stop on lap 95, taking on fuel and changing three tires (the rarely-worn left-front was left in place). His stop was timed at 33 seconds. That gave the lead back to Jones, who now enjoyed a 37-second margin. Dan Gurney in the other Lotus, however, had a worn out right-rear tire, and his pit stop dragged on for 42 seconds. Gurney went a lap down and dropped to 9th place.\nJim Hurtubise, an early contender who started slipping in the standings due to handling issues, dropped out at the halfway point with an oil leak.\nSecond half.\nJim McElreath spun in the pits, brushed the wall, and lost a wheel. He was able to get to his pit stall, and was able to rejoin the race.\nJust after the 120-lap mark, Eddie Johnson spun about three-fourths the way down the backstretch, likely due to hitting an oil slick. He spun to the inside, and crashed into the inside wall. Under the yellow light on lap 125, Parnelli Jones made his second pit stop, taking advantage of the caution. After a 27-second pit stop, he came out of the pits still in the lead, and lost minimal ground.\nWith 50 laps to go, Parnelli Jones had a 43-second lead over second place Jim Clark, and A. J. Foyt was in third. All other cars were at least one lap down. Dan Gurney had worked his way back up to 4th, Roger McCluskey was running 5th, followed by Eddie Sachs, Rodger Ward, Jim McElreath, Don Branson, and Bobby Marshman filling out the top ten.\nAt around lap 160, Duane Carter blew an engine in turn one, bringing out the yellow light. Leader Parnelli Jones took advantage of the yellow once again, and ducked into the pits. He changed tires in 20 seconds, and was back out on the track. His once commanding lead, however, was down to only 10 seconds. The Lotus team of Jim Clark and Dan Gurney were now running 2nd and 4th, respectively, and the question remained if they would both be able to go the distance without another pit stop to change tires.\nWhen the green came back out, Jim Clark began steadily closing the gap behind Parnelli Jones. With 25 laps to go, Jones' lead was down to only 5–6 seconds. Meanwhile, Dan Gurney was forced to the pits with a worn out right-rear tire. A couple laps later, he was back in the pits to change the right-front, and Gurney fell out of contention for the victory. He wound up 7th at the finish.\nFinish.\nIn the closing laps, Eddie Sachs spun on two occasions, once on lap 179, then again in turn three on about lap 189, the second time hitting the wall and losing a wheel. The second spin was the impetus of a controversy that embroiled over the next few minutes.\nWith about twenty laps to go, USAC officials were growing increasingly concerned with the sight of smoke venting from the leader's car. Parnelli Jones had been visibly leaking oil for some time due to a horizontal crack in the external oil tank at the rear of the car. Some observers were reporting the smoke was more intense, particularly in the turns, and that dripping oil was making the track slick, which led to Eddie Sach's crash in turn three. USAC chief steward Harlan Fengler was contemplating displaying the black flag to Jones, which would have sent him to the pits for consultation, and almost certainly deny him any chance at victory.\nJ. C. Agajanian, the owner of the Jones entry, immediately confronted Harlan Fengler and Henry Banks in a heated exchange at the start/finish line. Colin Chapman of the Lotus team also rushed over to join the discussion, arguing for Clark's case, and that Jones should be disqualified for leaking oil. Agajanian argued that the leak was minor, and had ceased once it dropped below the level of the crack. He also quipped that other cars on the track were leaking worse, without recourse. The confrontation went on for several minutes on the grass parapet by the starter's stand, and USAC ultimately decided not to black flag Jones.\nThe green light came back on for lap 193, and Jones quickly pulled out to a 21-second lead. After Clark had narrowed the gap significantly, Jones was again holding a commanding lead. Parnelli Jones stayed in front and led to the finish. With the white flag waving, third place Roger McCluskey was running right with Jones down the mainstretch. The two cars were dicing through some traffic, and McCluskey spun out and came to a rest in turn three, bringing out a last-lap yellow flag. Jones narrowly skirted by the incident on the outside unscathed, and cruised to victory. Jim Clark come home second, and A. J. Foyt finished third.\nPost-race.\nThe day after the race, Eddie Sachs and Parnelli Jones got into an argument, and exchanged fists over the oil leak controversy. Chief steward Harlan Fengler explained his decision not to black flag Jones, citing that the leak had subsided, and that so few laps were left, that he didn't want to \"take this race away from a man on a snap judgement.\"\nThe Lotus team, while unhappy with the perceived favoritism offered to the American participants, ultimately declined to protest. They acknowledged Jones' clear superiority in the event. In addition, Ford officials recognized that a victory through disqualification of Clark's biggest competitor would not be well received by the American public.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network.

        "text": "The 46th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Wednesday, May 30, 1962.\nA historic pole day saw Parnelli Jones break the barrier in qualifying. Rodger Ward and Len Sutton finished 1st-2nd for Leader Cards Racing.\nThe 1962 Indy 500 marked the final 500 wherein the entire 33-car field consisted of U.S.-born participants. It was also the first race held with the track surface paved entirely in asphalt, with just the ceremonial single yard of bricks exposed at the start/finish line.\nRace schedule.\nFor 1962, the Opening Day of practice was shifted back to Saturday April 28. Time trials were held on the second and third weekends of May, allowing the 500 Festival Open Invitation golf tournament the entire fourth weekend of May. Bump Day was held May 20, ten days prior to the race. Carburetion Day, the final day of practice was held Monday May 28, along with the 500 Festival Parade later that evening.\nTime trials.\nTime trials were scheduled for four days.\nRace recap.\nFirst half.\nParnelli Jones took the lead at the start, and led the first 59 laps. The first incident on the track occurred on lap 17. A four-car crash in turn four involved Jack Turner, Bob Christie, Allen Crowe, and Chuck Rodee. A lengthy yellow light period was needed to clean up the incident.\nSecond half.\nRodger Ward led the final 31 laps en route to victory. It was his second 500 win, after winning also in 1959. His Leader Cards teammate Len Sutton finished second, accomplishing the first team \"sweep\" of 1st-2nd since the Blue Crown team did it in 1947 and 1948.\nAfter dominating much of the early race, Parnelli Jones, who started on the pole and led 120 laps, finished 7th. Jones chances for victory faded around the lap 125 mark when he lost his brakes. Unable to easily bring his car to a halt during pit stops, his crew put out tires so he could bump up against them or ride over them in order to help stop the car.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network.

        "text": "The 45th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Tuesday, May 30, 1961. For the first time since 1949, the Indianapolis 500 was not recognized on the World Championship calendar. The race celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first Indy 500 in 1911.\nEddie Sachs and A. J. Foyt were battling for 1st-2nd in the latter stages of the race. On Foyt's final scheduled pit stop, his crew was unable to properly engage the fuel mechanism, and his car did not take on a full load of fuel. Foyt returned to the track, and was pulling away from Sachs. Foyt's car was running faster due to the light fuel load, but his crew signaled him that he would be unable to make it to the finish without another pit stop. The crew borrowed a fuel feed mechanism from Len Sutton's team, and signaled Foyt to the pits.\nFoyt gave up the lead on lap 184 for a splash-and-go. That handed the lead to Sachs, who was now leading by 25 seconds. With three laps to go, the warning tread showed on Sachs' rear tire and Sachs decided to play it safe. Rather than nurse the car around, he pitted to replace the worn tire on lap 197. Foyt took the lead with three laps to go and won his first (of four) Indy 500 victories by a margin of 8.28 seconds.\nA notable story included the appearance of two-time defending Formula One World Champion Jack Brabham from Australia, who drove the race in a low-slung, British built Cooper powered by a Coventry Climax engine. Dubbed the \"British Invasion,\" it would be the first notable post-war appearance of a rear-engined car, and within five years the rear-engined revolution would take over the Speedway. The venerable front-engined roadsters with their larger and more powerful engines were much faster down the long straights, but the superior handling of Brabham's Cooper in the corners kept his car competitive. Brabham qualified 17th at 145.144 mp/h and drove the car to a respectable 9th-place finish, completing all 200 laps. He had planned to run conservatively and make only two pit stops, but tire wear and fuel consumption forced him to make a 3rd stop, negating his strategy. Had he driven more aggressively with three pit stops, he might have been much closer to the lead serial.\nFive months after the race in October 1961, the front straight of the track was paved over with asphalt, and thus the entire track was now paved in asphalt and only a single yard of bricks at the start/finish line was left exposed from the original 1909 brick surface. The remainder of the original 3,200,000 bricks now lie underneath the asphalt surface. This meant that the 1961 race was the last 500 in which cars raced on the original bricks other than those at the start/finish line.\nPractice and time trials.\nNicknamed the \"Tinley Park Express,\" Tony Bettenhausen, Sr. was killed in a crash during a practice run on May 12. He was testing a car for Paul Russo. It was determined that an anchor bolt fell off the front radius rod support, permitting the front axle to twist and mis-align the front wheels when the brakes were applied. The car plunged into the outside wall, then rode along the top, snapping fence poles and tearing segments of the catch fence. The car came to rest upside-down on top of the outside wall, and Bettenhausen was killed instantly. Before the time trials Bettenhausen had been the favorite to become the first driver to break the 150 mph barrier at the Speedway.Time trials was scheduled for four days:\nEddie Sachs sat on the pole with an average speed of 147.481 mph (237.348 km/h).\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nTrack worker fatality.\nJohn Masariu, 38 father of 6, of Danville, Indiana was serving as a member of the fire/safety crew. On the 127th lap of the race, driver Eddie Johnson spun out in turn 4, but did not suffer significant damage and he was not injured. A small fire broke out on the car. A safety fire truck went to his aid. John Masariu, who was the principal of Ben Davis Junior High and was serving as a safety worker, fell or jumped off the back of the fire truck. A moment later, the truck driven by James (Johnny) Williams accidentally backed over him, and he was injured fatally.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network.

        "text": "The 29th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday, May 30, 1941. The start of the race was delayed due to a fire that swept through the garage area on race morning. No persons were injured, but one car in the field was destroyed. The race rolled off with only 31 cars, and ran to its scheduled distance. This would be the final \"500\" prior to the United States involvement in WWII. It was not known at the time, but it would be the final race organized by Speedway president Eddie Rickenbacker, and due to the war, the race would not be held again until 1946.\nRace details.\nSam Hanks was injured in a practice crash the day before the race and withdrew. Rather than elevate the first alternate to the starting field, Hanks was credited with 33rd place.\nGarage area fire.\nOn the morning of the race a fire broke out in the \"Gasoline Alley\" garage area. George Barringer's revolutionary rear-engined car was destroyed. At the time, the car was being refueled (with gasoline). In a nearby garage, another car which was owned by Joel Thorne was being worked on with a welder. The fumes caught fire from the sparks of the welding, and a huge fire broke out which burned down about a third of the southern bank of garages. The start of the race was delayed by a couple hours, and fire fighters had trouble getting to the Speedway to put out the blaze due to the heavy race day traffic. Barringer's car was withdrawn, and he was credited with 32nd finishing position. With both Sam Hanks and Barringer out, the race lined up with only 31 cars.\nVarious equipment, tools, parts, and other supplies were lost in the fire. Two cars that did not qualify for the race were reported to have been damaged. However, all of the other cars that qualified for the race were safely evacuated. No major injuries were reported. The fire was put out, but the site smoldered throughout the day, and smoke continued to rise even after the race had safely started.\nAbout a month later, the entire garage complex was demolished. At some point during summer and fall of 1941, a new Gasoline Alley was built in it place. However, it would sit unused until 1946.\nWilbur Shaw.\nTwo-time defending champion (and three-time winner overall) Wilbur Shaw crashed while leading on lap 152, and failed in his bid to become the first driver to three-peat at the Indianapolis 500 (and first four-time winner). As of 2023, no driver has ever won the Indianapolis 500 three consecutive years. Going down the mainstretch, the car lost control, and hit the outside wall, rupturing the gas tank. Shaw was drenched with fuel, and suffered a back injury which left him immobile for several minutes. Despite the fuel spill, the fuel did not ignite, and Shaw was brought to safety by the medical staff.\nIt is believed that the morning garage fire had an effect on Shaw's efforts. At some point before the race, Shaw's crew was preparing his tires for race day, and used chalk to write notes on the spare tires. One particular wheel was determined to be out of balance, and rather than being discarded, it was labeled in chalk with the words \"USE LAST\". However, the firefighters' water hoses are believed to have washed off the chalk message. Shaw inadvertently took on the bad wheel during a pit stop, which caused his crash.\nShaw never drove another competitive lap at the Speedway, although he did participate in a special private tire test at the Speedway during World War II.\nFloyd Davis &amp; Mauri Rose.\nFloyd Davis was the starting driver for the #16 car. On lap 72, Davis came in for a pit stop, and was relieved by Mauri Rose. Rose had started the race in another car and dropped out earlier. Car owner Lou Moore was apparently unsatisfied with Davis' performance thus far in the race, and ordered Rose to take over. Rose charged up the standings and took the lead in the #16 car, and went on to win. Both drivers were credited as \"co-winners,\" similar to what occurred in the 1924 race. This marked the last time that one car would carry two drivers to victory at Indy.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nOther Notes.\nSpeedway president Eddie Rickenbacker did not attend the race, and instead listened to it on the radio.

        "text": "The 1942 Indianapolis 500 was scheduled for Saturday May 30, 1942, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It was to be the 30th annual running of the famous automobile race. The race was canceled due to the United States involvement in World War II. In total, the Indianapolis 500 was not held from 1942 to 1945.\nThis was the second instance in which the Indianapolis Motor Speedway suspended the annual running of the Indianapolis 500. During World War I the Speedway management voluntarily suspended competition in 1917–1918. However, for World War II, the decision to cancel the race was more resolute, and ultimately was part of a four-year nationwide ban on automobile racing.\nDuring the war, the track was closed and neglected, and fell into a terrible state of disrepair. Towards the end of the war, revival of the \"500\" appeared unlikely, and the facility was in danger of being demolished in favor of development.\nBackground.\nOffseason.\nFollowing the 1941 race, the 1941 National Championship was won by Rex Mays. With the hostilities of World War II escalating abroad, rumors began to circulate during the summer of 1941 that the 1942 race may be suspended. Track officials, however, rebuffed the rumors, and insisted the race would go on as planned. The AAA Contest Board announced their rules package for 1942, and with the United States still not involved in the war, preparations were underway to race. Rules and specifications were effectively frozen, as parts shortages due to the war were beginning to affect the sport.\nA fire had swept through the \"Gasoline Alley\" garage area on the morning of the 1941 race, destroying the car of George Barringer, and burning down about a third of the southern bank of garages. About a month later, plans were drafted to rebuild the garages, and the work was done at some point during the summer and fall of 1941.\nAs was customary at the time, a number of non-points exhibition races took place at the Speedway in July, August, and September 1941. These races were usually put on to entertain visiting conventioneers. On September 9, 1941, an exhibition \"match race\" was held at the Speedway to entertain delegates attending the National Association of Postal Supervisors convention. Five drivers - Duke Nalon, Cliff Bergere, Russ Snowberger, Chet Miller, and George Connor - ran two short races. Nalon won the first, a 10-mile race, and Bergere won the second, a 15-mile race. It would be the last event held at the Speedway before the war intervened.\nCancellation.\nTicket order forms were available for the race in November 1941. Less than a month later, the attack on Pearl Harbor launched the United States into World War II. Within days, public and political pressure began to mount on Speedway management to suspend the race.\nInitially, the Speedway management was noncommittal about canceling the race, and tentatively proceeded with plans for the race. On December 29, 1941, Speedway president Eddie Rickenbacker announced that the 1942 Indianapolis 500 was canceled, and the race would remain suspended throughout the duration of the war. Unlike during World War I, all automobile racing under the auspices of the AAA Contest Board was suspended, and furthermore in July 1942, the federal government moved to ban automobile racing, primarily on account of rationing. Other reasons cited, however, included the need for the skilled mechanics and technicians from the racing fraternity to shift their labor to war efforts, or even enlistment. In addition, the intrinsic use of auto racing as a testing and proving ground for the automobile industry was largely unimportant, as the industry had already shifted its focus to wartime production and away from motoring public.\nRickenbacker initially offered the Speedway to the U. S. military for any purpose they saw fit. During World War I, it was activated as the 821st Aero Repair Squadron. But they could not use it during World War II, because warplanes of the day needed longer runways than the track's mile straights provided. Thus the Speedway gates were locked, and the facility was abandoned. In March 1942, nearly the entire Speedway staff was laid off, and the headquarters offices at 444 North Capital Avenue in downtown Indianapolis was closed. The race would not be held from 1942 to 1945. The golf course on the premises, however, did operate for at least some time during the war. During the period in which the track was closed, it fell into a terrible state of disrepair. Grass and weeds overwhelmed the brick racing surface, and the old wooden grandstands became frail and unsuitable and inhospitable. The infield became an un-kept quagmire of weeds and overgrowth. Locals would occasionally wander the dormant infield, hunting small vermin, ride bicycles around the course, or simply explore the grounds.\nMany former and future Indianapolis 500 drivers were servicemen in the war effort during World War II. Sam Hanks is believed to be the only driver who served in the war, and drove in the race both before and after. Some drivers from before the war period worked as consultants during the war to various suppliers. Most drivers who served did not return to racing afterwards, but a number of drivers who were not servicemen drove before and after. Several World War II veterans returned home to later become Indy drivers, including winners Lee Wallard, Bob Sweikert, and Rodger Ward.\nRevival.\nTowards the end of the war, Firestone received permission from the U.S. government to conduct a tire test at the Speedway. On or approximately November 25, 1944, Firestone tested several passenger cars at the track. On November 29, 1944, Wilbur Shaw tested a race car, driving a full 500 miles, averaging about 100 mph. A second similar test was reported in the spring of 1945. Driver Sam Hanks took a tour of the facility with mechanic Harry C. \"Cotton\" Henning, and reported that the track was overgrown with weeds, the bleachers were about to collapse, and both conjectured that the race was finished.\nOn May 30, 1945, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope came to the Speedway to hold a war bonds rally, putting on a 45-minute show with Jerry Colonna and other entertainers. They then took part in a charity golf tournament at the Speedway Golf Course with Ed Dudley.\nAfter World War II was over in the summer of 1945, Eddie Rickenbacker was mostly uninterested in reviving the Speedway, due to other commitments, including his involvement with Eastern Air Lines. He was looking to sell the property, perhaps to developers. Wilbur Shaw helped consummate a deal for Tony Hulman to purchase the track in November 1945, and it reopened in 1946. Hulman worked diligently over the next few months to revive and clean up the dilapidated facility, and make it suitable for world-class racing once again.\nThe 30th Indianapolis 500 was held May 30, 1946."

This was the first Indianapolis 500 presided over by new track owner Tony Hulman. The track had closed in late 1941 due to World War II, and over the next four years, the facility fell into a terrible state of disrepair. Hulman purchased the Speedway in November 1945, and quickly went to work cleaning up the grounds, which had become overwhelmed by overgrowth and weeds. The Speedway re-opened, and the 1946 race was considered a rousing success.\nRace winner George Robson would be killed in a racing crash just months after the victory.\nThe 1946 running of the 500 was the first of sixty-one consecutive years (1946-2006) that featured popular fixture Tom Carnegie on the Speedway public address system.\nDuring the pre-race ceremonies, James Melton performed the song \"Back Home Again in Indiana.\" It was the first time the traditional song had been performed before the start of the race.\nSale of the Speedway.\nOn December 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor launched the United States into World War II. On December 29, 1941, then-president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Eddie Rickenbacker announced that the 1942 Indianapolis 500 was cancelled, and the race would remain suspended throughout the duration of the war. The Speedway gates were locked, and the facility was abandoned. The race would not be held from 1942 to 1945. During the period in which the track was closed, it fell into a terrible state of disrepair. Grass and weeds overwhelmed the brick racing surface, and the old wooden grandstands became frail and unsuitable and inhospitable.\nTony Hulman announced the Indianapolis 500 would resume on its traditional date of Memorial Day for 1946. The AAA Contest Board subsequently announced that the specifications and rules would remain largely unchanged from 1941. \nIn mid-December, Indiana Lieutenant Governor Richard T. James, while on an official trip to Europe, formally extended invitations to European racing teams to enter for the 500.\nRace schedule.\nThe deadline for entries to be received was midnight on May 1, along with a $125 entry fee. As had been customary, the track was made available for practice beginning May 1. Some teams, however, began arriving and setting up at the track as early as mid-March. Due to the ongoing renovations and construction, spectators were not allowed through the gates until May 11; only participants and press were allowed to enter the gates before then. In addition, practice over the first ten days of May was limited to 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. daily. On May 11, the track was opened to spectators for the first time during the month for a charge of 50¢ per person. Also on May 11, practice time was extended from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.\nTime trials was tentatively scheduled for five days - the two weekends leading up to race day, along with the Tuesday two days before the race. However, rain and the lingering shortage of necessary parts kept many of the cars off the track. Eventually, eight total days were made available for qualifying in order to fill the field to the traditional 33 cars.\nRace preparations.\nJanuary.\nThe rules announced were largely carried over from 1941, with few changes. Prize money was set at $20,000 for first place, and the traditional 33 cars would make up the starting grid.\nFebruary.\nTickets for the 1946 Indianapolis 500 officially went on sale on February 1. Mail orders had been pouring steadily in since the track was sold in November. Some eager fans sent requests for tickets as early as August (shortly after V-J Day) anticipating the track would reopen. Even though at the time there were no plans yet in place to reopen the track, much less hold the race.\nNumerous announcements were made with regard to officials and personnel. Seth Klein returned as the chief starter, Chester Ricker returned as the director of timing and scoring, and Henry Ford II was named the driver of the Lincoln Continental pace car. Kirkpatrick studio was signed on as the official photographers of the 500-mile race. The Indiana State Police was assigned to crowd control duties.\nEntries slowly began to arrive, bringing the total to six by the end of the month. Cliff Bergere and Joie Chitwood were the first two drivers to be entered. Cars were entered for Russ Snowberger, Ted Horn and George Connor. On February 7, Harry McQuinn flew into the Speedway, landing his Aeronca Champion airplane on the backstretch, arriving to personally deliver his entry for the race. Construction workers at the track briefly halted work to watch the plane land. Though not yet entered, driver Al Putnam was preparing for the race.\nMarch.\nSpeedway officials continued to rebuild staff for the race. Clifford M. Rigsbee was appointed head of a new technical group at the Speedway. A welcoming committee with the local chamber of commerce was formed, in order to re-acclimate spectators to the event after the hiatus during the war. In addition, the Speedway announced Dr. E. Rogers Smith as the chief of the track medical staff.\nThe $300,000 renovation project at the track was reported to be on-schedule. The grounds were now mostly cleaned up, and the biggest item of work was the pouring of concrete for the new Paddock grandstand across from the Pagoda. Excavation for the new G grandstand was underway, and many new parquet seats were already in place behind the pit area. The old diner adjacent to Gasoline Alley had been razed and a new restaurant was to be built in its place. With less than two months until race day, advanced reserved tickets sales were reported as brisk.\nBy the end of the month, the entry list was up to 15 cars. Cars were entered for Al Putnam, Steve Truchan, and Arthur M. Sims entered the machine that Wilbur Shaw drove to victory in the 1937 race, but a driver was not yet named. One other car was entered by Ed Walsh without a driver named. Three-time pole position holder and 1941 National Champion Rex Mays was slated to drive the \"Bowes Seal Fast Special\", the same car he drove to second place in 1941. Despite facing financial and transportation difficulties, at least five European drivers were inquiring about submitting entries.\nEarly in the month, a minor controversy loomed. It was reported some drivers, particularly those from the U.S. West Coast, were expressing concern about the perceived low purse announced for the race.\nApril.\nWith less than a month to go before the track officially opened for practice, entries continued to pour in. Cars were entered for Harry Schell, Raphaël Bethenod, Emil Andres, George Barringer, Joel Thorne, Cliff Bergere, Rudolf Caracciola, Tazio Nuvolari, Chet Miller, and several others. By the end of the month, the entry list was up to 44 cars.\nRefurbishment of the facility continued, including the near-completion of new grandstands. On April 6, the Speedway Golf Course opened for business. Officials announced that a small number of tickets were still available.\nGeorge Barringer arrived with his car on April 22, and two days later on April 24, Barringer became the first driver to take to the track for the year. Barringer's supercharged rear-engined machine completed laps over 115 mph. Track president Wilbur Shaw, George Connor, Chet Miller, and others were on hand to watch. The following day, April 25, Tony Bettenhausen became the second driver to take laps.\nOff the track, Roy E. Cole, vice-president in charge of engineering at Studebaker, was named the chairman of the technical committee for the race. Also, the Lap Prize Fund was accumulating, and the prize fund was announced at $60,000, quelling some of the concern about a low purse.\nPractice.\nThe track officially opened for practice on Wednesday May 1. However, practice time was limited to 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm for the first ten days in order to allow construction crews extra time to finish refurbishing the facility. In addition, spectators were not allowed inside the gates until May 11. The deadline for entries to be received was midnight on May 1, and any entries postmarked on or before May 1 were accepted. Numerous entries came in just before the deadline, bringing the total to 56 cars.\nDuring the first week, many drivers and mechanics had arrived at the track, often seen hanging out at the restaurant in Gasoline Alley, and working on cars. However, few cars took to the track yet. At least ten cars were already in the garage area by Saturday May 4, with more arriving each day. At the end of the first week, Tazio Nuvolari announced he was withdrawing from the race, due to the death of his son. Achille Varzi was named his replacement, but the car would ultimately fail to qualify.\nPractice started in earnest beginning on May 11. The track was now open from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and spectators were allowed to attended.\nTime trials.\nTime trials was originally scheduled for five days (May 18–19, 25–26, and 28), but rain delays took away available track time. In addition, post-war shortages of certain replacement parts delayed some cars from being able to participate in practice sessions. Officials eventually would make the track available for qualifying on three additional days in order to fill the field to the traditional 33 cars. The minimum speed to qualify was set at 115 mph. Approximately 56 entries were expected to make attempts to qualify.\nOfficials retained the four lap (10-mile) qualifying runs that were traditional from 1920–1933 and from 1939–1941. The fastest qualifier on the first day of time trials (\"pole day\") would win the pole position. Cars that qualified on the second day would line up behind the first qualifiers, and so on. Prior to World War II, on time trials days the track would typically be open until \"sundown.\" But for 1946, the times were standardized such that the track would close each day at 5:30 p.m., except for the final day - unless weather interfered.\nSaturday May 18.\nThe first day of time trials was scheduled for Saturday May 18. The track would be open from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The favorites for the front row included Harry McQuinn, Cliff Bergere, Rex Mays, and Ted Horn. Since many teams were lacking practice time, and some lacking parts, less than a dozen cars were expected to take to the track on Saturday.\nOver 20,000 spectators arrived for the first significant track action in nearly five years. However, rain threatened most of the afternoon, and allowed only six cars to complete runs. During a practice run, Frank McGurk in the \"Shoof Special\" spun coming out of turn four and hit the outside wall. The car hit the outside rail a second time, then slid across the track hitting the inside guardrail. McGurk was not seriously injured. The car was not seriously damaged, and was expected to be repaired. Pole favorites Rex Mays and Ted Horn suffered engine problems, preventing them from going out Saturday. Horn broke a water pump, while Mays suffered broken connecting rods and bearings.\nIndy veteran Cliff Bergere won the pole position with a speed of 126.471 mph. At age 49, Bergere became the oldest pole winner in Indy history up to that point. Paul Russo, driving a unique twin-four-cylinder engine machine, qualified second to sit in the middle of the front row. On Russo's car, one engine drove the front axle, and the second engine drove the rear axle. Russo was on pace to take the pole through three laps, but on his fourth and final lap, one of his superchargers got too hot, and dropped the speed down. Sam Hanks rounded out the front row, despite leaking oil which obscured his goggles. Rear-wheel drive cars swept two spots on the front row, with Jimmy Jackson (5th) the highest front-wheel-drive-only machine.\nRain closed the track for nearly two hours, prompting officials to extend qualifying until 7:30 p.m. Still, only seven cars made runs, and only six were completed. Mauri Rose had a fast first lap that could have put him on the front row, but the engine threw a rod on lap two.\nSunday May 19.\nTime trials was scheduled for 12:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. A crowd of 40,000-60,000 spectators arrived but not a single car made a qualifying attempt. High winds kept most cars off the track early on, and later rain washed out most of remainder of the afternoon. Some cars did practice, but when the rains came, most spectators departed. Officials announced that Monday May 20 would be designated for qualifying, in order to make up for lost track time over the weekend.\nMonday May 20.\nAfter weather interfered on Sunday, officials made Monday May 20 available for qualifications. Three cars completed runs in front of a small crowd of only 3,000 spectators. Ted Horn (driving Wilbur Shaw's 1940 winning car) was the fastest of the day. Horn's car, prepared by \"Cotton\" Henning, ran two identical laps, and put him on the inside of row three.\nOfficials announced that Tuesday May 21 would not be available for qualifications.\nTuesday May 21.\nCharles Van Acker crashed. Duke Nalon made an exhibition run.\nWednesday May 22.\nQualifying resumed on Wednesday May 22. Approximately 20,000 spectators saw five cars complete runs, and the field was filled to 14 cars. Mauri Rose, who threw a rod on his first attempts, returned Wednesday with a different engine, was the fastest car of the day.\nDuring a practice run for his driver's test, Hal Robson broke an axle in turn two, lost a wheel, and spun out. Robson was not injured, and completed the test later on in a different car.\nSaturday May 25.\nAfter two days of practice only, time trials resumed on Saturday May 25. With a speed of 128.861 mph, Rex Mays tentatively became the fastest qualifier in the field. As a qualifier on the fourth day, however, Mays would line up in 14th starting position. Mays was followed by George Robson and Jimmy Wilburn, both over 125 mph. Wilburn had passed his rookie driver's test just two hours prior to making his attempt. A crowd of about 12,500 witnessed the afternoon.\nSunday May 26.\nRalph Hepburn shattered the one-lap and four-lap track records and became the fastest qualifier in the field. Hepburn returned to the track a day after his car quit during his first attempt. Under cold weather and threatening skies, about 22,500 spectators saw fours drivers complete runs, and the field was filled to 22 cars.\nHepburn's fourth lap was the fastest, a track record , and his four-lap average was a record . Hepburn drove the 8-cylinder front-wheel drive \"Novi Governor Special\", entered by W.S. Winfield.\nMonday May 27.\nAt the request of many teams, time trials was extended into yet another day, with the track open from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Four cars completed runs, tentatively filling the field to 27 cars. Hal Robson joined his brother George in the field, but the speeds were noticeably down from Sunday's record-breaking efforts.\nWith only one day remaining to qualify, six positions were tentatively left to be filled.\nTuesday May 28.\nThe deadline for qualifications was set at sundown (8:08 p.m.) on Tuesday May 28. When the day opened, six spots were left open in the field. Tony Bettenhausen withdrew his previously-qualified car due to a broken crankshaft. He would re-qualify a new car to be the fastest driver of the day.\nDuring a practice run, Caracciola, in one of the \"Thorne Engineering Special\"s, lost control and crashed in turn two. He was thrown from the machine, which was badly damaged. Caracciola was seriously injured, and rushed to the hospital. After his release from the hospital, track owner Tony Hulman invited Caracciola to recuperate at his home in Terre Haute.\nDanny Kladis was the first driver to complete a run during the afternoon, at a relatively slow pace of . He slipped down the standings as the day progressed, but his speed would hold up and he barely held on to qualify 33rd. Late in the afternoon, Charles Van Acker completed his required four laps at an average of 115.666 mph to fill the field at 33 cars. Buddy Rusch was now \"on the bubble\", the slowest car in the field. Steve Truchan was the next car out, but he pulled into the pits after only three laps.\nJust minutes before sundown, three cars took to the track in an effort to bump their way into the field. Tony Bettenhausen, Billy Devore and George Connor all took to the track at the same time in order to make it in before the deadline. Bettenhausen earned a new spot in the field after withdrawing his previous car. Connor and Devore bumped Buddy Rusch and Charles Van Acker, respectively. One final car, Freddie Winnai made a last-ditch effort to make the field, but the car quit before completing a lap.\nRace summary.\nAt the start, Mauri Rose tied an Indy record by leading the first lap from the 9th starting position. Attrition was high in the first race after World War II, as three of the first four cars on the grid were out before the 50 mile mark (20 laps). Paul Russo crashed in turn 3 on lap 16. Debris, oil, and leaking gasoline at the crash scene necessitated a lengthy caution period. Russo suffered a broken leg, and some other minor injuries. Several other drivers dropped out early with a bevy of mechanical problems, including Sam Hanks, Rex Mays, George Barringer, Henry Banks, and George Connor.\nOn lap 40, Mauri Rose suffered a heavy crash in turn 3. Rose entered the race as the defending co-winner, having won the 1941 race with Floyd Davis. Rose spun and the car reportedly rolled over the retaining wall. Rose suffered burns, but no critical injuries.\nGeorge Robson took the lead for good on lap 93. His six-cylinder Sparks was the first 6-cylinder winning car since Ray Harroun in 1911. Rookie Jimmy Jackson finished second, at the relatively close margin of 44 seconds.\nTed Horn made two lengthy pit stops and fell seven laps behind the last running car. Horn returned to the track, and charged all the way up to third place at the finish. Horn was the fastest car on the track in the second half, and he completed the entire 500 miles, but was 12 minutes behind Robson.\nA mild controversy came about after the race, as race winner Robson was accused of breaking the rules by not exiting the cockpit of the car during pit stops. A protest was filed, but it was later dismissed. Only nine cars were still running at the finish. Rookie Bill Sheffler, running off the pace most of the afternoon, nursed his car to 9th place finish. Under the rules at the time, all cars still running at the finish were placed ahead all cars that had dropped out - regardless of total laps completed. Sheffler, running a pace of about 60 mph, managed to complete 139 laps before he was flagged off as the last car still running.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Mutual Broadcasting System.

Despite the one-time altered distance, the race is still considered part of the continuous lineage of the Memorial Day classic, known as the Indianapolis 500. In addition to the altered distance, the start time was moved from 10:00 a.m. to the early afternoon (1:30 p.m.)\nEddie Rickenbacker took the lead at the start, and led the first nine laps until dropping out with steering problems.

        "text": "The 7th Liberty 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, May 31, 1919.\nAfter a two-year hiatus due to World War I, the Indianapolis 500 returned to competition in 1919. Howdy Wilcox won, accompanied by riding mechanic Leo Banks. More than half the field (19 of 33 cars) consisted of rookie drivers, tied for the most ever, excluding the inaugural race where all 40 cars were considered \"rookies.\" Ralph DePalma, the 1915 winner, and the driver who suffered a defeat in 1912, again put in a strong performance. DePalma led 93 of the first 102 laps, and drove the first half at record-breaking speed. Tire problems, however, necessitated a long pit stop, and DePalma finished in 6th place.\nRain was a factor during practice, limiting available track time in the days immediately leading up to time trials. Since most teams did not arrive until later in the month, some cars had very limited preparation time. Qualifying was supposed to be held on just one day, but officials decided to add two additional days due to the lost track time.\nThe first half of the race was marred by three fatalities. Driver Arthur Thurman died in a crash on lap 45. On lap 96, Louis LeCocq and his riding mechanic Robert Bandini wrecked in turn two, and both were burned to death.\nRace background.\nOver two years had gone by since the last competitive events had been held at the Speedway. The 1916 race was followed by the Harvest Auto Racing Classic, at which point the track was closed due to the escalation of World War I. When the Armistice was signed in November 1918, the Speedway management was anxious to begin planning for the resumption of the 500-mile race for 1919. Some early rumors circulated that the race may change dates to July 4, or even expand to 1,000 miles. These rumors were briefly entertained when the AAA Contest Board announced that both May 30 and July 4 were being set aside on the calendar for the event.\nOn December 6, 1918, Speedway business manager T.E. \"Pop\" Myers announced that the 1919 Indianapolis 500 would be scheduled for Friday, May 30. It was decided to keep the traditional date, and likewise return the race to a distance of 500 miles. The 1916 race had been scheduled for 300 miles (a decision that management later mostly regretted), the only such time which the race was scheduled for less than 500 miles. AAA would return as the sanctioning body. An editorial the following day in the \"Indianapolis News\", however, sharply criticized the choice of Memorial Day. It was going to be the first \"Decoration Day\" holiday following the end of the \"Great War\", and they believed that the holiday should be left alone to properly honor the many thousands of war casualties. About a week later, Speedway management announced that they would change the date to Saturday May 31. The race was deliberately moved off Memorial Day (Friday May 30) and pushed to Saturday so as not to detract from the holiday.\nThe race was given a new name for 1919, the Liberty Sweepstakes as a gesture to the peacetime brought on by victory and the end of the war. The new title was used for only one year. Without hesitation, Cliff Durant submitted the first entry on December 16.\nPractice.\nThe deadline for entries to be submitted was midnight on Thursday May 1. A total of 43 cars were entered, including three entries by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The AAA Contest Board confirmed that the maximum starting field rule of 33 cars would apply.\nTime trials.\nTime trials were scheduled for three days, May 27–29. Elimination trials consisted of one timed lap. This would be the final time single-lap qualifying runs were used at Indianapolis. In 1920, four-lap time trial runs would be introduced. For the first time, qualifiers would line up in the grid by speed based on the day they qualified. All cars that qualified on the first day would line up by speed rank first, with the fastest qualifier starting on the pole position. The remaining cars that qualified on subsequent days would line up by speed rank behind the first day qualifiers. The cars from the second and third days, however, were merged on the grid. This format was adopted in order to encourage more drivers to qualify early on, instead of waiting until the last minute.\nOriginally it was planned for all elimination trials to be held on Tuesday, but due to inclement weather, the schedule was expanded to allow Wednesday and Thursday as well. The minimum speed to qualify was set at 80 mph, and the field was set at a maximum of 33 cars. Based on the entries prepared at the track, the expectation was that about six cars would fail to qualify.\nIn an effort to foil the \"bootleg\" programs that were being printed and sold in and around the Speedway, car numbers were not assigned until race morning.\nTuesday May 27.\nThe first day of time trials was held Tuesday May 27 starting at 10:00 a.m. Ralph DePalma (98.2 mph) was the first car in the field. Former winner René Thomas shattered the track record with a lap of 104.7 mph to secure the pole position. Thomas went out late in the afternoon, deciding to wait out windy conditions. A total of eleven cars completed runs, all over 90 mph. Howdy Wilcox went out after Thomas, and qualified second with a speed of 100.0 mph.\nWednesday May 28.\nThe second day of time trials was held Wednesday May 28. The qualifiers on the second and third day would line up behind the qualifiers from the first day. Louis Chevrolet drove a Frontenac at a speed of 103.1 mph to be the fastest car of the day. Tommy Milton was on his way to qualifying over 101 mph, but his car slowed, and he managed a lap of only 89.9 mph.\nDuring a practice run, Omar Toft spun in the south turns, but avoided contact and was able to continue around. Two cars, Al Cotey and Dave Lewis, made an attempt but failed to qualify. Cotey was too slow (below the 80 mph minimum) and Lewis suffered engine failure. Both drivers were eligible to try again on Thursday.\nA total of 13 cars completed qualifying runs Wednesday, filling the field to 24 cars. The final starting positions, however, for those 13 cars would not be finalized until qualifying was completed on Thursday.\nThursday May 29.\nThe third and final day of time trials was held Thursday May 29. The day opened with nine spots available in the field.\nThe 1913 winner Jules Goux was the final car to qualify. During a practice run on Thursday, he suffered a broken piston and broken connecting rod, which blew a hole in the Peugeot's engine block. The Premier team offered him a spare engine, and Goux spent the entire day working to install it. Late in the day, just minutes before sundown, Goux took the car to the track. After one single warm-up lap, he signaled to officials to start the run. His lap of 95 mph bumped James Reynolds, and Goux surprisingly made the field. Not as lucky was Dave Lewis. A day after suffering engine problems, Evans was on his qualifying lap, running over 100 mph. Two-thirds of the way through the lap, the bearings in the engine burned out, and broke the crankcase.\nDuring an exhibition run, Ralph DePalma attempted to set track records in a 950-c.i.d. car, the same car he set records in at Daytona. He failed to break René Thomas's one-lap record from Tuesday, but he did set 5-mile and 10-mile distance speed records.\nRace recap.\nThe start of the race was scheduled for Saturday May 31 at 11:00 a.m. local time. The facility was closed to the public on Friday, but participants were allowed a brief period of practice time on Friday morning for last-minute preparations. The rest of the day was spent prepping the track by scrubbing the brick surface of oil and debris.\nMaurice Becker, the riding mechanic for Howdy Wilcox during the month, was disallowed by his family from participating in the race. He was replaced for the race by Leo Banks just hours before the start.\nA crowd estimated at 120,000 arrived at the Speedway on a hot and sunny Saturday morning. At 8 a.m., the Purdue Band entertained fans. Pace car driver Jesse G. Vincent, with passenger Eddie Rickenbacker, took the field around for one unscored warm-up lap. At a speed of about 80 mph, the field was released for the start. André Boillot's car initially failed to pull away, but eventually got started, and sprinted to catch up to the rest of the field.\nFirst half.\nThe first half of the race belonged to 1915 winner Ralph DePalma. Depalma led the first 65 laps, and raced at a record pace. With an average speed of over 92 mph, DePalma was shattering existing track records. Though the pace was incredible, his lead was not large. His closest contenders stayed within reach. Louis Chevrolet took the lead for lap 66–74, before giving it back to DePalma. Also in the top five were Earl Cooper, Howdy Wilcox, and René Thomas.\nTwo fatal accidents, taking the lives of three competitors, marred the first half of the race. On lap 45, Arthur Thurman lost control at about 90 mph, swerved to the inside wall on the backstretch, then flipped over three times. Thurman was thrown from the car, and landed about twenty-five feet away. He died about ten minutes later as he was being taken to the hospital. His riding mechanic Nicholas Molinaro suffered a fractured skull, but survived.\nOn the 96th lap, Louis LeCocq and his riding mechanic Robert Bandini lost control and turned over in the exit of turn two. The fuel tank ruptured and burst into flames. Both LeCocq and Bandini were pinned underneath the car, doused with gasoline, and burned to death at the scene. With other cars whizzing by, flaming gasoline was spread in all directions, as crews attempted to extinguish the flames.\nSecond half.\nAfter dominating most of the first half, Ralph DePalma gave up the lead on lap 103 to make a pit stop. DePalma was experiencing tire trouble, and was forced to make long stop to make repairs. DePalma lost about ten laps in the pits, and fell out of contention.\nHowdy Wilcox took the lead on lap 103, and led the rest of the way. After major crashes and high attrition in the first half, the second half of the race settled down into a steady pace. Only three cars dropped out in the second half, leaving 14 cars running to complete 500 miles. Wilcox made a pit stop for tires and fuel at some point after the 400 mile mark. He came out of the pits with a two-lap lead over Eddie Hearne, and cruised the rest of the way.\nLate in the race, Louis Chevrolet reportedly came into the pits on three wheels. He made repairs, and finished in 7th place. After losing much time in the pits, Ralph DePalma worked his way back up to finish 6th. DePalma nipped Chevrolet at the scoring line by a fraction of a second in the battle for 6th-7th. DePalma led 93 laps, bringing his career total so far to 425 laps led - by far the most of any driver during that era. (DePalma would lead 613 laps in his career).\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie"

        "text": "The 31st International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday, May 30, 1947. It was the opening round of the 11 races that comprised the 1947 AAA Championship Car season. The 1946 winner, George Robson, had been killed on September 2, 1946 in a racing incident. Driver Shorty Cantlon would be killed in an accident during the race.\nBeginning in 1947 the Speedway issued \"Bronze\" and \"Silver\" badges. Bronze badges allowed gate and garage access during the month and silver badges did the same but also allowed pit access. On race day, one needed a Back Up Card Early bronze badges were indeed bronze, but silver badges were only a silver colored pot metal. Bronze badges began being made of a bronze colored pot metal sometime in the late 1950s or early 1960s.\nTime trials &amp; ASPAR boycott.\nTime trials was scheduled for five days. The minimum speed to qualify was set at 115 mph. In the months leading up to the race, several top drivers that were members of a union, the American Society of Professional Auto Racing (ASPAR), threatened to boycott the race over the purse size. The AAA Contest Board refused to heed their demands, and when the entry list was closed on May 8, many of the top drivers, particularly several popular west coast drivers, were not on the list. A total of 35 cars were entered, but at least nine had no driver listed, and 13 of the entries were inexperienced novice drivers. After the practice began for the month, officials decreed that the boycotting drivers would not be allowed late entry. After several weeks of dispute, an agreement was made for the ASPAR drivers to participate midway through the month.\nWhen qualifying closed at 6 p.m. on Wednesday May 28, the field had only been filled to 28 cars. Duke Dinsmore was the final qualifier, completing his run amidst some scoring confusion by the officials, just as the time had run out. Race officials initially stressed that Wednesday would be the final day available to qualify. However, a day later, they re-opened qualifying for one hour late on Thursday May 29 in an effort to fill the field. Mel Hansen and Emil Andres were the only two cars to complete attempts, and after approval by the other entries, were added to the grid to bring the field to 30 cars.\nThe heartbreak story of the day belonged to driver Billy Devore. After failing to make the field on Wednesday, the Bill Schoof crew worked diligently to make repairs to their car, hoping that officials would re-open qualifying. When word was announced that additional time trials would be held Thursday, the crew scrambled to get the car prepared. Late in the evening, with about 20 minutes left until closing, the crew drove the race car from their garage about six miles away to the track with a police escort. When they arrived at the gate at 6:58 p.m., however, officials closed time trials, and DeVore was not permitted to qualify.\nRace summary.\nLate in the race, Lou Moore teammates Bill Holland and Mauri Rose were running 1st and 2nd. The pit crew displayed a confusing chalkboard sign with the letters \"EZY\" to Holland, presumably meaning for him to take the final laps at a reduced pace to safely make it to the finish. Mauri Rose ignored the board, and charged to catch up to Holland. Holland believed he held a lap lead over Rose, and allowed him to catch up. The two drivers waved as Rose passed Holland, with Holland believing it was not more than a congratulatory gesture.\nIn reality, the pass Rose made was for the lead, and he led the final 8 laps to take the controversial victory. The race was marred by a 41st lap crash that claimed the life of Shorty Cantlon.\nRose's distance finish time of 4:17:52.17 was the second fastest finish of the Indianapolis 500 ever, at the time. Only the 1938 Indianapolis 500 had been completed in a faster total time as of 1947. After Rose completed the 500 mile distance, approximately 40 minutes was given for additional drivers to finish, before any remaining drivers who had \"not\" completed the distance by then were flagged off the track. The 1947 race was also the coldest on record, with an average temperature of 50 degrees and morning low of 37.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Mutual Broadcasting System, the precursor to the IMS Radio Network.

        "title": "Walt Williams (baseball)",
        "text": "Walter Allen Williams (December 19, 1943 – January 23, 2016) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball and the Nippon Professional Baseball league as an outfielder between and , most prominently as a member of the Chicago White Sox where, he established himself as a fan favorite for his enthusiastic playing style. He also played for the Houston Colt .45s, Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees before playing for two seasons in the Nippon Professional Baseball league with the Nippon-Ham Fighters.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Brownwood, Texas, Williams was nicknamed No-Neck due to his relatively short stature (5 feet 6 inches) combined with a muscular, compact torso and a short neck. His odd physical appearance was the result of a typhus injection he received as a baby. After Williams' hometown was hit by a flood, the government gave typhus injections to prevent the spread of the disease. Williams was so muscular even as a baby that medical personnel were unable to reach a vein, except in the back of his neck. He developed a crick in his neck, which then stiffened and shrank. Williams was sent in adolescence to live with an aunt in San Francisco, where he graduated from Galileo High School having played football, basketball and baseball for the school teams.\nBaseball career.\nWilliams was signed by the Houston Colt .45's as an amateur free agent in 1963. After spending one season in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut at the age of 20 with the Colt .45's on April 21, 1964. Williams played in only 10 games with the Colt .45's, when he was selected off waivers on May 26, 1964 by the St. Louis Cardinals. \nWilliams was sent back to the minor leagues to play for the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the Northern League, where he posted a .318 batting average in 88 games. He progressed to the Tulsa Oilers in 1965 where, he scored 106 runs and hit .330 to win the Texas League batting championship. In 1966, Williams repeated his performance with a batting average of .330 and scored 107 runs. On December 14, 1966, he was traded by the St. Louis Cardinals with Don Dennis to the Chicago White Sox for Lee White and Johnny Romano.\nWilliams returned to the major leagues in 1967 during an era dominated by pitching. He hit for a .240 batting average in 1967, in a year in which only four players hit above .300. Led by manager Eddie Stanky, the 1967 White Sox were in a tight pennant race with the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers and the Minnesota Twins before fading to a fourth-place finish. Williams' hustling style of play became evident during a June 14 game against the Red Sox. With a baserunner on second base, Williams fielded a single to right field and threw the ball to home plate. First baseman Tom McCraw intercepted the throw then, trapped the hitter in a rundown as he had strayed too far from first base. Shortstop Ron Hansen's return throw to first base was wide and the ball rolled towards the Red Sox dugout. Appearing seemingly from out of nowhere, Williams dived for the ball before it reached the dugout then, he sprang to his feet and threw it to second base where Hansen tagged the baserunner out. With his cheerful demeanor and hustling style of play, Williams became a fan-favorite during his tenure with the White Sox.\nIn 1968, he split his playing time between the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League where he hit for a .318 average and, the White Sox where, he hit for only a .241 average in 63 games. Carl Yastrzemski would be the only player in the American League to break the .300 mark in 1968. Williams had a breakout season in 1969 when he became the White Sox' starting right fielder and, produced a career-high .304 batting average to finish sixth in the American League batting championship and scored 59 runs. He was one of only six American League players to have a batting average above the .300 mark and, the first White Sox player in six seasons to hit above 300. Williams struck out only 33 times and grounded into just 5 double plays during the 1969 season. Williams was the fifth-toughest to strike out in the league; he was fanned only once every 14.3 at bats.\nAfter the 1969 season, he became embroiled in a contract dispute with White Sox General Manager, Ed Short, who told Williams if he refused the team's salary offer, he wouldn't get the chance to play regularly. Williams' batting average would drop to .251 in 110 games in 1970. Short was fired in 1971 and Williams rebounded to lead the White Sox with a .294 average and a career-high .344 on-base percentage. When the White Sox acquired first baseman Dick Allen in 1972, they moved former first baseman Carlos May to left field, leaving Williams to battle for the final two outfield positions with Rick Reichardt, Pat Kelly, Jay Johnstone and Jim Lyttle. He appeared in only 77 games, posting a .249 batting average as the White Sox battled for the American League West Division lead before finishing the season in second place, five and a half games behind the eventual world champions, the Oakland Athletics.\nDuring his off-season, Williams volunteered his time to talk to children who were first time drug offenders as part of the Cook County drug abuse prevention program. On October 19, 1972, Williams was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Eddie Leon. In January 1973, Williams' two-year-old son died from spinal meningitis while he was playing in the Venezuelan Winter League for the Águilas del Zulia.\nHe became a utility player and occasional designated hitter for the Indians in 1973, producing a .284 batting average with career-highs in home runs (8) and runs batted in (38). On August 21, 1973, Williams broke up a bid for a no-hit game by former teammate Stan Bahnsen when he hit a single with two outs in the ninth inning.\nOn March 19, 1974, Williams was traded to the New York Yankees as part of a three-team trade. He continued his role as a utility player and designated hitter with the Yankees but, only produced a .113 batting average in 43 games. He recovered in 1975 with a .281 batting average in 82 games, helping the Yankees take first place in the American League East Division in late June before the team faded to third place at the end of the year.\nAfter being released by the Yankees on January 27, 1976, Williams played in Japan for the Nippon-Ham Fighters from 1976 to 1977. He then played in the Mexican League from 1978 to 1979, playing in his final professional game at the age of 35. In 1989, he played for the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a 10-year major league career, Williams played in 842 games, accumulating 640 hits in 2,373 at bats for a .270 career batting average along with 33 home runs, 173 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .310. Williams was a good defensive outfielder, committed 19 errors in 565 games for a fielding percentage of .981. He played the entire 1971 season without committing an error, compiling a 1.000 fielding percentage.\nMinor league managing career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Williams worked as the Sports Director of the Brownwood Community Center in his hometown. He then served as the White Sox first base coach during the 1988 season. In 1992, Williams became the manager of the Gastonia Rangers in the South Atlantic League. In 1993 and 1994 he managed the Charleston RiverDogs. His managing record over three seasons was 187 wins and 228 losses. Williams also managed the Altoona Rail Kings of the Heartland League in 1997, winning 36 games and losing 36.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams' nephew, Derwin Williams, played in the National Football League. Williams' great-grand nephew, Mason Williams, plays in MLB. Williams died after a heart attack on January 23, 2016, in Abilene, Texas."

        "title": "1999 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 1999 UEFA Champions League final was an association football match between Manchester United of England and Bayern Munich of Germany, played at Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain, on 26 May 1999, to determine the winner of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League. Injury time goals from Manchester United's Ole Gunnar Solskjær cancelled out Mario Basler's early goal for Bayern to give Manchester United a 2–1 win and their first European Cup title since 1968, their second overall. Referee Pierluigi Collina has cited this match as one of the most memorable of his career, and described the noise from the crowd at the end of the game as being like a \"lion's roar\".\nThe two sides had played each other earlier in the competition, having both been drawn in Group D in the group stage; Bayern won the group, while Manchester United qualified for the knockout phase as one of the two best runners-up across all six groups. After beating Inter Milan in the quarter-finals, Manchester United beat another Italian side, Juventus, in the semis to reach the final; meanwhile, Bayern beat fellow Germans Kaiserslautern in the quarter-finals, before overcoming Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv in the semis. The victory completed a treble-winning season for Manchester United, having already secured the Premier League and FA Cup titles in the preceding 10 days. Bayern were also playing for a treble, having won the Bundesliga and reached the DFB-Pokal final, although they went on to lose that match as well to Werder Bremen on penalties.\nBackground.\nManchester United and Bayern Munich had only met twice in competitive matches before the final, both meetings coming earlier in the 1998–99 season and both finished as draws. Manchester United's only other German opponents in their history were Borussia Dortmund, against whom they had an overall winning record, with three wins, two defeats and a draw in their six matches, including a 10–1 aggregate win in the second round of the 1964–65 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a 2–0 aggregate defeat in the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League semi-finals. Bayern Munich had an equally narrow advantage in their 22 matches against English opposition, with seven wins, nine draws and six defeats, including a win over Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup final and a defeat to Aston Villa in the 1982 final.\nIncluding the victory over Leeds in 1975, Bayern Munich had won the European Cup on three occasions going into the 1999 final. With three victories in a row from 1974 to 1976, they became only the third team to achieve such a feat after Real Madrid (1956 to 1960) and Ajax (1971 to 1973). They had also finished as runners-up twice: in 1982 against Aston Villa and 1987 against Porto. Although Bayern had been waiting 23 years for a European Cup title, Manchester United had had to wait even longer, as their only victory had come in 1968 against Benfica at Wembley in extra time. Their manager then was Matt Busby, who had been seriously injured 10 years earlier in the Munich air disaster, which killed eight of his players on the way back from a European Cup tie in Belgrade, before rebuilding the team to become European Cup winners. Busby died in 1994; the day of the 1999 Champions League final would have been his 90th birthday.\nAlthough it was the second Champions League season to feature clubs that had not won their national leagues the year before, Manchester United and Bayern Munich were the first such clubs to reach the final of the competition. Nevertheless, both went into the match as champions, having won their domestic leagues in 1998–99; Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title with a 1–1 draw against Hertha BSC on 9 May with three games to go, while Manchester United left it until the last day of the season (16 May), when they came back from 1–0 down against Tottenham Hotspur to win 2–1 and beat Arsenal to the title by a point. Both teams were also playing for the treble; in addition to their league win, Manchester United had beaten Newcastle United in the 1999 FA Cup Final on 22 May to claim the Double, while Bayern were due to play Werder Bremen in the 1999 DFB-Pokal Final on 12 June.\nRoute to the final.\nQualifying round.\nSince neither Manchester United nor Bayern Munich had won their respective leagues in 1997–98, both sides faced a qualifier to enter the 1998–99 Champions League. Manchester United were drawn against Polish champions ŁKS Łódź and won 2–0 on aggregate, goals from Ryan Giggs and Andy Cole in the first leg at Old Trafford giving them the victory. Bayern Munich had an easier time against Yugoslavian champions Obilić, winning 4–0 in the first leg at the Olympiastadion with goals from Stefan Effenberg, Giovane Élber, Alexander Zickler and Thorsten Fink, all scored in the space of 17 second-half minutes. In the second leg, played at Partizan's ground in Belgrade, an 88th-minute goal from Lothar Matthäus rescued a 1–1 draw to give Bayern a 5–1 win on aggregate.\nGroup stage.\nIn the draw for the group stage, Bayern Munich were placed in Pot 2 and Manchester United in Pot 3 as Germany was higher than England in the UEFA association club coefficient rankings. They were drawn together in Group D, along with Spanish champions Barcelona and Danish champions Brøndby, in what became known as the \"group of death\". United and Bayern found themselves bottom of the group after the first round of matches, in which Bayern lost 2–1 away to Brøndby after surrendering a 1–0 lead in the last three minutes; United, meanwhile, played out a 3–3 draw at home to Barcelona after twice giving up the lead. The first group stage meeting between United and Bayern took place at the Olympiastadion on matchday 2 and finished in a 2–2 draw; Élber opened the scoring for Bayern before goals from Dwight Yorke and Paul Scholes gave United the lead, only for a Teddy Sheringham own goal – brought about by an error by Peter Schmeichel – to level the scores in the 89th minute.\nMatchdays 3 and 4 saw double-headers, with Manchester United taking on Brøndby and Bayern Munich playing Barcelona. Manchester United beat Brøndby 6–2 in their first match at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, then 5–0 at Old Trafford two weeks later. Bayern also recorded a pair of victories over Barcelona, winning 1–0 at the Olympiastadion and 2–1 at the Camp Nou. On matchday 5, United played their second match against Barcelona – their first trip of the season to the Camp Nou – and again the two sides played out a 3–3 draw. With Bayern beating Brøndby 2–0 at home, the German side moved onto 10 points and took top spot in the group going into the final round of matches, one point ahead of United. Qualification for the quarter-finals was only guaranteed for the group winners, meaning that both United and Bayern had to play for victory in their final match against each other at Old Trafford. United took the lead just before half-time through a Roy Keane strike from just outside the penalty area; however, Hasan Salihamidžić equalised for Bayern in the 55th minute and the game finished as a 1–1 draw. The result meant that Bayern finished as group winners, but United's 10 points from their six matches was enough to see them go through as one of the two group runners-up with the best record.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the quarter-finals, Bayern Munich were drawn against Group F winners and fellow German side Kaiserslautern, while Manchester United were paired with Group C winners Inter Milan. Two Yorke goals gave United a 2–0 win in their first leg at Old Trafford, while Bayern beat Kaiserslautern by the same scoreline at the Olympiastadion through goals from Élber and Effenberg. In the second leg, Nicola Ventola pulled a goal back for Inter, but Paul Scholes secured United's passage to the semi-finals with a late away goal. Meanwhile, Bayern won convincingly at Kaiserslautern, as goals from Effenberg, Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and an own goal from Uwe Rösler gave them a 4–0 win, 6–0 on aggregate.\nUnited again came up against Italian opposition in the semi-finals, facing Juventus, who had beaten Greek side Olympiacos in the quarters, and Bayern were drawn against Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv, who beat reigning champions Real Madrid to reach the semis. Both first legs finished as draws; Giggs scored in injury time to secure a 1–1 home draw for Manchester United after Antonio Conte had put Juventus ahead midway through the first half, while Bayern also had to come from behind to draw 3–3 in Kyiv. A single goal from Basler proved the difference between Bayern and Dynamo in the second leg, giving the Germans a 4–3 aggregate win. Manchester United fell behind early in the second leg in Turin, as Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Goals from Keane and Yorke before half-time levelled the tie but gave United the advantage on away goals, before Cole secured victory with the winning goal seven minutes from the end of the match.\nPre-match.\nVenue and ticketing.\nThe Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona, Spain, was selected as the venue for the final at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Lisbon, Portugal, on 6 October 1998. The selection process had begun more than four months earlier, in May 1998, when FC Barcelona submitted the Camp Nou as a contender to host the match in recognition of the club's centenary year. The other venues in contention to host the match were London's Wembley Stadium and Marseille's Stade Vélodrome, but the Camp Nou was considered by UEFA's Stadiums Commission to be the favourite for its superior security, comfort and capacity. The Camp Nou had hosted one previous European Cup final: Italian club Milan's 4–0 victory over Steaua București of Romania in 1989. It had also hosted two Cup Winners' Cup finals, in 1972 and 1982; the latter was won on home turf by Barcelona.\nThe Camp Nou was constructed over three years from 1954 to 1957 as a replacement for Barcelona's previous home, the nearby Camp de Les Corts. The original capacity of the Camp Nou was just over 93,000, but its first major European final, the 1972 Cup Winners' Cup Final, was attended by just 35,000 spectators. 1982 was the stadium's busiest year to date, hosting not only the 1982 Cup Winners' Cup Final, but also five matches at the FIFA World Cup, including the opening match, all three matches in Group A of the second group stage and the semi-final between Poland and Italy. Subsequent renovations meant that by 1999, the stadium's capacity had reached 115,000.\nDue to UEFA regulations regarding standing at football matches, the Camp Nou's terraced sections were closed for the 1999 Champions League final, reducing the capacity to approximately 92,000. Of these, around two-thirds were reserved for the two finalist clubs (approximately 30,000 tickets each). The remaining third was divided between fans of FC Barcelona (around 7,500 tickets), UEFA, and competition sponsors. After an initial announcement that the clubs would only receive 25,000 tickets each, the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA) called that figure \"ridiculous\", claiming it would push black market prices to \"astronomical levels\"; the group's spokesman, Lee Hodgkiss, suggested a figure closer to 50,000 would be more appropriate, given the stadium's usual capacity of around 115,000. Despite the club receiving only 30,000 tickets, it was estimated that up to 100,000 Manchester United fans travelled to Barcelona for the final, paying around £300 for flights and around £1,000 for match tickets. Many were able to buy tickets from touts, who had paid up to £400 to buy from Barcelona fans who had bought through their club for the equivalent of £28.\nAs well as reducing the capacity of the stadium, UEFA also mandated that the Camp Nou pitch be narrowed by from to , to match UEFA's 'standard' pitch size.\nMatch officials.\nThe match referee was Pierluigi Collina of the Italian Football Federation. Collina was promoted to the FIFA International Referees list in 1995, and took charge of his first UEFA Cup matches in the 1995–96 season. He had only refereed eight Champions League matches before the 1999 final, three of which came in the group stage earlier in the season, including the match between Barcelona and Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou on 4 November 1998; however, he had also taken charge of four matches at the 1996 Summer Olympics, including the final between Nigeria and Argentina, and two group stage matches at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Collina was supported by fellow Italian officials Gennaro Mazzei and Claudio Puglisi as assistant referees, and fourth official Fiorenzo Treossi.\nMatch ball.\nThe match ball for the final was the Nike NK 800 Geo, a white ball with a standard 32-panel design. It featured a large \"swoosh\" across two adjacent hexagonal panels with the Champions League logo on a pentagonal panel above, and a pattern of five-pointed stars similar to those used in the UEFA Champions League logo over the entire surface of the ball.\nKits.\nAs both Manchester United and Bayern Munich's primary kits featured significant amounts of red, UEFA regulations about kit clashes would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt it would have been a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.\nOpening ceremony.\nBefore kick-off, opera singer Montserrat Caballé – moving around the field on the back of a golf cart – performed a live version of \"Barcelona\", a song she recorded with the late Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1987, accompanied by a recording of Mercury on the stadium's electronic screen. The opening ceremony featured inflatable versions of some of Barcelona's most recognisable landmarks, as well as flag-bearers waving flags of the crests of the participating teams. Bayern Munich's fans, meanwhile, created a tifo of the name of their team with thousands of coloured cards.\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nManchester United left England two days before the final, first flying from Manchester Ringway Airport to Heathrow, where they boarded a Concorde aircraft for the flight to Barcelona. They stayed in the Meliá Gran hotel in the town of Sitges, about down the coast south-west of Barcelona. Captain Roy Keane and midfielder Paul Scholes both missed out on the final due to suspension; manager Alex Ferguson had originally considered selecting Giggs to join Nicky Butt in central midfield, but ultimately picked David Beckham as a player who could help the team control possession in the middle of the pitch, with Giggs on the right wing and Jesper Blomqvist starting on the left. Keane had suffered an ankle injury in the FA Cup final that would keep him out until the start of the following season, but his suspension rendered the injury irrelevant to his selection. Norwegian defender Henning Berg also missed out through injury, meaning that his compatriot Ronny Johnsen – who had been an early contender to play alongside Butt in midfield – played in central defence alongside Jaap Stam, who overcame an Achilles injury. With Keane out, goalkeeper Schmeichel – who in November 1998 had announced his intention to leave Manchester United at the end of the season – was named as captain for his final Manchester United appearance; this meant that both sides were captained by their goalkeepers, as Oliver Kahn wore the armband for Bayern. As Manchester United's top two goalscorers throughout the season, Cole and Yorke started up front, leaving Sheringham – who had played a part in both goals in the FA Cup Final a few days earlier – on the bench. Also on the bench were fellow striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær, back-up goalkeeper Raimond van der Gouw, defenders David May, Phil Neville and Wes Brown, and midfielder Jonathan Greening.\nBayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld announced his team's line-up for the final two full days ahead of the match. Injuries also impacted on his selections, with French left-back Bixente Lizarazu and Brazilian forward Élber having suffered season-ending knee injuries. Élber's absence resulted in Bayern playing a three-man attack of Basler, Jancker and Zickler, while Lizarazu was replaced on the left flank by Michael Tarnat playing in a wing-back role opposite Markus Babbel on the right. Babbel was originally intended to play a man-marking role on Giggs, with his defensive abilities earning him selection ahead of the more attack-minded Thomas Strunz; however, this was nullified by Giggs' selection on the right wing, where he would play against Tarnat. The Bayern defence was anchored around sweeper Matthäus, who played behind Thomas Linke and Ghana international Samuel Kuffour – the only non-German in the Bayern side (by comparison, Manchester United had four Englishmen in their team); Linke and Kuffour's partnership at centre-back meant club captain Thomas Helmer had to settle for a place on the bench. Effenberg and Jens Jeremies played in central midfield for Bayern, with Jeremies man-marking Beckham.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nSix minutes into the match, Johnsen fouled Bayern striker Jancker just outside the area, and Basler placed a low free kick around the United wall to score the first goal, as Schmeichel was caught flat-footed. Although they were now a goal down, United began to dominate possession, but failed to create any clear-cut chances. The Bayern defence remained strong and well-organised, as Cole found out when his close-range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders. As Bayern began to look increasingly dangerous on the counter-attack than their opponents did in possession, Jancker repeatedly tested the United back four with a number of clever runs, some of which were flagged offside.\nCole once again found himself with a chance in the Bayern box, but goalkeeper Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Zickler sent a shot just wide from the edge of the box. As half-time approached, United winger Giggs, playing out of position on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that was as close as they were to come to a goal in the first half.\nSecond half.\nThe German team started the second half in a more positive mood, with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel within a minute after the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, first firing a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Babbel, who missed the ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs crossed towards Blomqvist, who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Ferguson to bring on Sheringham. Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Effenberg for a long-range shot that went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and into Schmeichel's arms. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy, when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game crept into the last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.\nInjury time.\nUnited won a corner just as the fourth official indicated three minutes of injury time, and with so little time left for an equaliser, Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived at the feet of Giggs on the edge of the area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 36 seconds into injury time. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.\nLess than 30 seconds after the subsequent kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time, under instruction from Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding the head of Sheringham, who nodded the ball down across the face of goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, stuck out a foot and poked the ball into the roof of the Bayern goal for United to take the lead with just 43 seconds of the three minutes of injury time to play. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.\nThe game restarted, but many Bayern players were overwhelmed with despair, virtually unable to continue and needed the assistance of referee Collina to drag themselves off the ground. They were stunned to have lost a game they had thought won just minutes before; several celebratory flares had already been ignited by the Bayern fans moments before United equalised, and ribbons in the club's colours had already been secured to the trophy itself in preparation for the presentation ceremony. United held onto their lead to record their second European Cup title, and at the final whistle, referee Collina described the cheers from the fans as being like a \"lion's roar\". Kuffour broke down in tears after the game, beating the floor in despair, and Jancker collapsed in anguish. Matthäus had captained Bayern in the 1987 European Cup final and lost in similar circumstances to two late Porto goals. He had been substituted with 10 minutes remaining, with victory seemingly assured.\nPost-match.\nThe game's ending was so unexpected that UEFA President Lennart Johansson had left his seat in the stands before Sheringham's equaliser to make his way down to the pitch to present the European Cup trophy, which was already decorated with Bayern ribbons. When emerging from the tunnel at the final whistle, he was stunned, and he later said: \"I can't believe it. The winners are crying and the losers are dancing.\" When the two teams went to collect their medals, Matthäus received his runner-up medal but removed it from his neck almost immediately. He never won the competition as a player, having moved to play in the United States for the MetroStars in March 2000, the year before Bayern next won the European Cup in 2001. Matthäus later commented that \"it was not the best team that won but the luckiest\". As captain of Manchester United, Schmeichel should have received his medal last, but instead he went up first before having to return to the back of the queue with Ferguson; the pair then lifted the trophy together, surrounded by the rest of Manchester United's players, including May, who climbed the presentation podium to a position of prominence in the celebration photographs.\nStaying true to his word from earlier in the season, the match was Schmeichel's last in a Manchester United shirt, and a month later he signed for Portuguese club Sporting CP. He spent two seasons in Portugal before returning to England for spells with Aston Villa and Manchester City. It was also Blomqvist's last competitive appearance for the club. After playing in all four matches of the club's pre-season tour of Australia and China in July 1999, he suffered a succession of knee injuries that ruled him out of competitive action for the next two seasons. He made two more appearances for the first team during the 2000–01 pre-season campaign, as well as three matches for the reserves in September and October 2001, before a free transfer to Everton in November that year. For Bayern Munich, substitutes Helmer and Ali Daei left the club in the summer of 1999; Helmer moved to England to play for Sunderland, while Daei remained in Germany with Hertha BSC.\nBayern president Franz Beckenbauer recognised that it was a loss of concentration in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: \"That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and there were only a few seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester [United] to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won.\" Manager Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: \"I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions.\"\nIn winning the trophy, Manchester United became the first English team to be crowned European champions since the Heysel Stadium disaster ban in 1985, which had resulted in English clubs being excluded from UEFA competitions for five years, and also the first team to achieve the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and European Cup in the same season. It was the first time the treble had been won since PSV Eindhoven in 1988; it would not be won again until Barcelona beat Manchester United 10 years later in the 2009 UEFA Champions League final. After becoming the first manager of an English club to achieve this honour, Ferguson was made a Knight Bachelor on 12 June 1999 in recognition of his services to football, as well as a bonus from the club reported to be in the region of £350,000 (the players received bonuses of £150,000 each). In a post-match interview with ITV's Gary Newbon, Ferguson provided a succinct summary of the game: \"Football, eh? Bloody hell\". After the treble was secured, much debate arose among English football fans as to whether the 1999 Manchester United team was the greatest club side ever, alongside past European Cup-winning teams. It was such a significant achievement for an English football club that Prime Minister Tony Blair took the time to watch part of the match and congratulate Manchester United from the opening of the new National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff.\nManchester United became the first team to win the European Cup or Champions League without being the champions of Europe or champions of their country the preceding season. They had finished second behind Arsenal in the 1997–98 FA Premier League, but had qualified through UEFA's expanded 24-team format, which had been introduced a season earlier. Had Bayern won the cup, they would have become the first team to achieve this feat, having also finished second in the Bundesliga to Kaiserslautern the season before. While Manchester United finished the season as treble champions, Bayern ultimately lost the DFB-Pokal final to Werder Bremen, which meant they finished the season with the Bundesliga title as their only silverware.\nManchester United received £2 million in prize money from UEFA for winning the competition, on top of the £10 million they had already won just for reaching the final; by comparison, Bayern Munich received £1.6 million for finishing as runners-up. Manchester United also received another financial boost in the form of an increase in the share price of their parent company on the London Stock Exchange; following the match, the price rose from 187 pence per share to 190 pence; however, this was still around 50p less than the shares were trading for earlier in the season during the attempted buyout of the club by BSkyB.\nManchester United planned an open-top bus tour of the city of Manchester the day after the game, at which they would parade their three trophies for an expected 700,000 people lining the streets between Sale and the city centre. The parade culminated with a reception at the Manchester Arena, for which 17,500 tickets were made available at £3 each; proceeds went to Ferguson's testimonial fund. Greater Manchester Police later estimated that the actual number of people who attended the parade was around 500,000.\nBroadcasting.\nIn the United Kingdom, the final was broadcast by ITV Sport with commentary provided by Clive Tyldesley and Ron Atkinson. The broadcast attracted an average of 15.5 million viewers, with a peak audience of 18.8 million at 21:30, just as Manchester United scored their two goals. The climax of the game was voted as the fourth-greatest sporting moment ever by Channel 4 viewers in a 2002 poll. In Germany, the match was shown on RTL Television, and was seen by an average of 13.59 million people over the course of the broadcast. In Spain, the match was shown on TVE.\nTreble Reunion match.\nOn 26 May 2019, Manchester United hosted a reunion match at Old Trafford against a Bayern Munich Legends team to mark the 20th anniversary of winning the treble and to raise money for the Manchester United Foundation. Most of the Manchester United squad from the 1998–99 season returned for the match, with the exception of Giggs, who was on coaching duty with the Wales national team. Despite not having been with Manchester United during the 1998–99 season, Karel Poborský, Mikaël Silvestre and Louis Saha completed the squad as regular participants in Manchester United Legends matches. Ferguson returned to manage the side, six years after his retirement from full-time management, joined by his 1999 assistant Steve McClaren and former club captain Bryan Robson as head coach. The Bayern squad featured six players who appeared in the 1999 final – Babbel, Kuffour, Effenberg, Matthäus, Jancker and Fink – as well as striker Élber, who missed the original match through injury.\nManchester United won the match 5–0. Solskjær, who had been appointed as manager of Manchester United in December 2018, opened the scoring in the fifth minute, having come on for Cole in the first minute of the match due to Cole's continued struggle with kidney trouble. Yorke made it 2–0 on the half-hour mark, before second-half goals from Butt, Saha and Beckham completed the scoring. The match was played in front of 61,175 spectators and raised £1.5 million for the Manchester United Foundation."

        "text": "The Walt Disney World Golf Classic was an annual golf tournament on the PGA Tour. The tournament was played on the Palm and Magnolia courses at the Walt Disney World Resort. It was played under several names, reflecting sponsorship changes.\nThe tournament was founded in 1971 as the Walt Disney World Open Invitational. From 1974 to 1981, the tournament was played as a two-man team event with a better-ball format. Title sponsors have included Oldsmobile, National Car Rental, Funai, and Children's Miracle Network.\nFrom 2007 to 2012, it was the final event in the PGA Tour Fall Series, and also the final official event of the PGA Tour season. As such, it was a final chance for many players to earn or retain a PGA Tour card through winning or getting into the top 125 on the Tour's money list. The 2010 and 2012 winners, Robert Garrigus and Charlie Beljan respectively, were both outside the top 125 before their wins.\nThe tournament was removed from the PGA Tour schedule for the 2013–14 wrap-around season after Children's Miracle Network declined to renew their sponsorship and no others were found.\nThe 2012 purse was $4,700,000, with $846,000 going to the winner.\nTelevision.\nThe event was televised by ESPN and ABC Sports, until the demotion of the event to the Fall Series in 2007, when it was relegated to cable-only on the Golf Channel. While ESPN and ABC, which are owned by Disney, covered both courses as a form of publicity for both, the Golf Channel covered only the Magnolia course with highlight packages sent in from the Palm. However, this is the manner in which the network has always covered tournaments with multiple venues.\nCourses.\nThe Magnolia Course at Walt Disney World is known as more \"tour\"-style than its sister the Palm Course. The Palm course is known as the prettier of the two, however. In the 2006 telecast, one commentator is quoted as saying that the Palm course has the better greens of the two courses. The Magnolia has grown to 7,516 yards to battle the usual low scores during the tournament's history. \nThe nearby Lake Buena Vista golf course has also been part of the tournament, along with the Palm and Magnolia."

        "text": " \nAlexander James Murphy OBE (born 22 April 1939) is an English former professional rugby league footballer, and coach of the mid to late 20th century. Known as 'Murphy the Mouth' (or \"Yapper\" by some referees) and regarded as one of the greatest halfbacks in the history of the British game, he represented Great Britain in 27 Tests and his club career was played at three clubs, St. Helens, Leigh and Warrington. Murphy assumed a player-coach role of the last two clubs and expanded his coaching role toward the end of his playing career to include clubs such as Wigan, Salford and Huddersfield. He later returned to both Warrington and Leigh respectively as a football manager. He was the first player to captain three different clubs to victory in the Challenge Cup Final .\nBackground.\nBorn in St. Helens, Lancashire on 22 April 1939, Murphy was brought up in Thatto Heath, and at ten years of age had played in both the junior and senior XIIIs at St Austin's School.\nPlaying career.\nMurphy had received town and county schoolboy honours by the time he signed with his native St. Helens for £80 on his 16th birthday in 1955. The signing itself was almost akin to a military operation. St. Helens representatives smuggled Murphy 'under cover' to a nearby house until the clock struck midnight to signal Murphy's 16th birthday, and his eligibility to sign professional terms. He was coached from an early age by Jim Sullivan. During his national service Murphy played rugby union for the Royal Air Force, frequently playing for an Air Force team the same week as playing rugby league for St. Helens.\nSt. Helens.\nMurphy began his career at St. Helens playing reserve team rugby (known then as the 'A' team). After several \"A\" team games, Murphy demanded a place in the first team. This demand was refused and so he promptly demanded a transfer. The dispute was settled and Murphy's first team début was against Whitehaven at Knowsley Road.\nMurphy's career at St. Helens went on to be long and successful. While still a teenager, he was selected to tour Australasia with the Great Britain side in 1958, becoming the youngest touring player at the time, and helping Great Britain to victory in the famous second Test in which they were down to ten men. He scored 21 tries in 20 appearances on that tour.\nHe won the Championship with St. Helens in 1958–59 season. The following year he played in Great Britain's World Cup-winning side. With his club he claimed the Challenge Cup in 1961.\nOn the 1962 Ashes tour he suffered a shoulder injury which caused him to miss three months of the domestic season and there was some speculation he would never play again. On this tour he scored 9 tries in 11 appearances.\nMurphy became the first British rugby league footballer to have two testimonial matches. They were at St. Helens in 1965, and at Warrington in 1976.\nAlex Murphy played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored a conversion in St. Helens' 35–12 victory over Halifax in the Championship Final during the 1965–66 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 28 May 1966, in front of a crowd of 30,165.\nAlex Murphy played , and scored a try in St. Helens' 12–6 victory over Wigan in the 1961 Challenge Cup Final during the 1960–61 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 13 May 1961, in front of a crowd of 94,672, and played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored a conversion in the 21–2 victory over Wigan in the 1966 Challenge Cup Final during the 1965–66 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 21 May 1966, in front of a crowd of 98,536.\nAlex Murphy played in St. Helens' 2–12 defeat by Oldham in the 1958 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1958–59 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 25 October 1958, played in the 4–5 defeat by Warrington in the 1959 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1959–60 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 31 October 1959, played in the 15–9 victory over Swinton in the 1960 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1960–61 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 29 October 1960, played , and scored a try in the 25–9 victory over Swinton in the 1961 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1961–62 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 11 November 1961, played in the 15–4 victory over Leigh in the 1962 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1962–63 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 26 October 1963, and played in the 12–4 victory over Swinton in the 1962 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1964–65 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 24 October 1964.\nAlex Murphy played in St. Helens' 0–4 defeat by Castleford in the 1965 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1965–66 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Tuesday 14 December 1965\nLeigh.\nMurphy left St. Helens to become player-coach at Leigh because he was unhappy at being moved to the s to accommodate the signing of Tommy Bishop. As the 1966–67 season began, Murphy declined to play for St. Helens. The Australian club, North Sydney indicated their interest in signing him. At the end of September, Murphy submitted a written transfer request to the St. Helens board who accepted it, putting him on the list at £12,000.\nNorth Sydney tabled a bid of £8,000 for Murphy which was accepted. However, at the last minute, Murphy agreed to a 5-year deal with Leigh to become the highest paid coach in the Rugby Football League.\nMurphy's first game in charge of his new team was against his former club in a league match at Hilton Park. Murphy's Leigh overcame a depleted St. Helens side by 29–5. Murphy later recounted in an issue of the Rugby Leaguer some 20 years later that:\n\"It never entered my mind to leave Saints in the first place. But events took over and there was a lot of pride involved on both sides and the situation reached the stage where a parting of the ways became inevitable.\"\nAlex Murphy played , and was the coach, and was man-of-the-match winning the Lance Todd Trophy in Leigh's 24–7 victory over Leeds in the 1971 Challenge Cup Final during the 1970–71 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 15 May 1971, in front of a crowd of 85,514. This was a match where Murphy's ability to attract controversy was once again exemplified. He was involved in an altercation with Leeds' Syd Hynes which resulted in Hynes being sent off for headbutting Murphy. Murphy was carried off the pitch on a stretcher, but later returned to the bench and was able to lift the trophy at the end of the game. Over the years, tales of Murphy winking to his teammates as he was carried from the field have endured, and Hynes always maintained his innocence.\nAlex Murphy played , and scored a conversion in Leigh's 2–11 defeat by Swinton in the 1969 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1969–70 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 1 November 1969, and played in the 7–4 victory over St. Helens in the 1970 Lancashire County Cup Final replay during the 1970–71 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 28 November 1970.\nAlex Murphy played , and was the coach in Leigh's 5–8 defeat by Castleford in the 1967 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1967–68 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 16 January 1968, and played , was the coach, and scored a conversion in the 11–6 victory over Wigan in the 1969 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1969–70 season at Central Park, Wigan on Tuesday 16 December 1969.\nWarrington.\nMurphy left Leigh shortly afterwards to become player-coach at Warrington. Murphy won one Great Britain cap while at Warrington. In 1973 a 20-match unbeaten run in the league helped Warrington win the League Leader's Trophy. The 1973–74 season was the most successful at Warrington, with the club winning the Challenge Cup, Captain Morgan trophy, John Player trophy and Club Merit trophy. The highlight was when Murphy coached, captained and played in Warrington's 24–9 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the 1974 Challenge Cup Final during the 1973–74 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 11 May 1974, in front of a crowd of 77,400. He was again the coach in the 7–14 defeat by Widnes in the 1975 Challenge Cup Final during the 1974–75 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 10 May 1975, in front of a crowd of 85,998, but missed playing in the match through injury, retiring as a player shortly after but remaining as coach of the club until 1978. During his time as the Warrington coach, his old rivals, Widnes succeeded in reaching another Challenge Cup final in 1976, their opponents being St. Helens. Murphy caused controversy by declaring that he would jump off the Silver Jubilee Bridge and into the River Mersey if Widnes won; luckily, Widnes were defeated 20 points to 5 and Murphy managed to keep his feet on dry land.\nAlex Murphy was the coach in Warrington's 0–0 draw with Salford in the 1974 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1974–75 season at The Willows, Salford on Tuesday 17 December 1974, and in the 5–10 defeat by Salford in the 1974 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final replay during the 1974–75 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Tuesday 28 January 1975.\nAlex Murphy was the coach in Warrington's 4–0 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the 1973–74 Captain Morgan Trophy Final during the 1973–74 season at The Willows, Salford on Saturday 26 January 1974, in front of a crowd of 5,259.\nCoaching career.\nUpon retirement, Murphy built upon the experience he had acquired as a player-coach by taking up the reins as a full-time coach. He was co-coach of England with Bill Oxley during the 1975 World Series.\nAfter Warrington, Murphy was appointed to high-profile roles at Salford (May 1978 to November 1980), Leigh (1980 to 1982) where in 1982 he guided Leigh to the Division 1 championship and Lancashire cup winners, before taking the role of coach of Wigan in 1982. There, he led them to victory in the John Player Trophy in 1983, and took them to the Challenge Cup Final in 1984, where they lost to Widnes. He left at the start of the next season, following a row with vice chairman Maurice Lindsay.\nIn 1988 Murphy was an inaugural inductee into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nHe took over as coach of St. Helens in 1986, taking them to Wembley Stadium, London in 1987, against Halifax, and again in 1989 where they played Wigan. St Helens lost by one point to Halifax, and were humiliated by Wigan in an error-ridden performance two years later, losing 27–0, becoming the first side ever held scoreless in a Challenge Cup Final at Wembley. During the last 10 minutes of the Challenge Cup Final, St. Helens received a penalty that was well within kicking range for either of their goal kickers, Great Britain international Paul Loughlin, and Australian dual international Michael O'Connor. Knowing that no side had ever been held scoreless in a Cup Final at Wembley and not wanting his St. Helens to be the first, Murphy frantically gestured from the sideline to team captain Paul Vautin to take the kick at goal despite the scoreline. Vautin ignored Murphy's instructions and instead the ball was kicked into touch for a tap restart. Wigan's defense held firm though and St. Helens last scoring opportunity was lost. This led to tension between Murphy and Vautin for a number of years until they worked together for the Australian Nine Network during television coverage of The Ashes series during the 1994 Kangaroo tour.\nIn 1991, he joined Huddersfield: within a year, promotion to the Second Division had been achieved.\nAfter a six-year absence from rugby league, Murphy returned to the game in 2003 as football director of Leigh after the National League One club sacked coach Paul Terzis.\nPost-retirement.\nIn 1998 Murphy was awarded the OBE for services to the game of rugby league. In 2000 his autobiography, \"Saint and Sinner\" was published. Murphy was also employed as a commentator by BBC television for a number of years working alongside long-time league commentators Eddie Waring, and later former dual rugby international Ray French. He also worked for Australia's Nine Network as an expert commentator during the 1994 Kangaroo tour.\nHe was also employed to write opinion columns for newspapers such as the Daily Mirror, and the Manchester Evening News. One was known as 'Murphy's Mouth.' In 2006 he became Chairman of Oxford Cavaliers rugby league club. Murphy is an inductee in both the St Helens RFC Hall of Fame, and the Warrington Wolves RLFC Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Jim Benton (American football)",
        "text": "James Warren Benton (September 25, 1916 – March 28, 2001) was an American football player. He played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) with the Cleveland / Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears between 1938 and 1947. Benton was the first NFL receiver to gain more than 300 yards in a game, a record that stood for 40 years. He was selected for the National Football League 1940s All-Decade Team.\nCollege career.\nIn 1934, he began his college career at Arkansas and set receiving records unheard of at the time. In 1936, Arkansas defeated Texas 6–0 on a Benton touchdown reception and won its first official Southwest Conference (SWC) championship. In spite of his sophomore year statistics not being included, he finished his career with 83 receptions for 1,303 yards and 12 touchdowns. Despite fewer games and shorter period of sports eligibility compared to today (as well as less emphasis on passing in the era), his receiving statistics stand as the 12th-best career total among Razorbacks. His 48 receptions remained a SWC record until 1963 and an Arkansas record until 1971. In spite of playing more than 70 years ago, he still ranks among the career receiving leaders in the history of Arkansas football.\nBenton was selected to several All-America teams following the 1937 season when he led the NCAA in receptions. In 1937, he set the NCAA record in pass receiving with 48 catches for 814 yards and 7 touchdowns. He was all SWC in 1936 and 1937. In 1937, he received the \"Houston Post\" Award as the outstanding player of the year in the Southwest Conference, was named first-team All American by the North American Newspaper Alliance and was a member of the College All Star team. He was selected to the Arkansas All-Century team in 1994.\nBenton also lettered in basketball for the Razorbacks in 1937 and 1938, with the team winning the 1938 Southwest Conference title.\nProfessional career.\nBenton began his NFL career in 1938 with the Cleveland Rams, after being drafted number 11 in the second round. He had a nine-year career, all with the Rams except for one year with the Chicago Bears. In 1941, he dropped out of pro football to coach high school football at Fordyce, Arkansas but returned to the Rams in 1942.\nIn his first season with the Rams, he led the league with 19.9 average yards per catch, and was third in both receiving yards and touchdowns. He was named to the 1939 Pro Bowl team after leading the league with seven touchdown receptions.\nIn 1943 due to the depletion of players called to military service, the Rams disbanded, and Benton who had been rejected for military service due to a heart murmur, was loaned to the Chicago Bears. During the season, he caught two touchdown passes to help Sid Luckman set the NFL single game record of seven touchdowns in defeating the New York Giants and caught a touchdown pass in Chicago's world championship victory over the Washington Redskins.\nIn 1944, back with the Rams, Benton made NFL history by catching 8 consecutive passes for 3 touchdowns against the Cardinal-Steelers. At season's end, he was the second ranked receiver behind fellow Arkansas native Don Hutson.\nIn 1945, in spite of playing only nine games, Benton ended the season leading the NFL with 1,087 yards receiving. He had 45 receptions and eight touchdowns. He averaged 118.6 yards receiving a game with his longest reception for 84 yards and a touchdown. He went over 100 yards receiving in six of his nine games. His most notable game was on Thanksgiving Day against the Detroit Lions, catching ten Bob Waterfield passes for 303 yards, helping the Rams win the divisional title. This broke Hutson's single game record and stood as the NFL single game record for over 40 years. Benton had nine receptions for 125 yards and a touchdown in the Ram's 15–14 victory over the Redskins in the NFL Championship game. Benton's 1945 performance ranks 7th all time in fewest receptions for 1,000 yards.\nIn 1946, Benton led the NFL with 63 receptions and with 981 yards receiving. During the season his most notable game was against the New York Giants when he had twelve receptions for 202 yards.\nBenton was the top ranked NFL receiver in 1945 and 1946. He was consensus all-NFL in 1945 and 1946 and second-team All Pro in 1939 and 1944. He was ranked among the NFL's top five receivers in six of his nine seasons.\nWhen he retired in 1947, Benton was the second leading receiver in pro football history with 288 receptions for 4,801 yards and 45 touchdowns. He and Hutson were the only receivers to lead the league in receiving multiple times. He had at least 11 games over 100 yards receiving (according to The ESPN Pro Football Encyclopedia Second Edition), including a 300-yard game and a 200-yard game. He averaged 533 yards per season and 55 yards per game. Benton played on two world championships, 1943 with the Chicago Bears and 1945 with the Cleveland Rams. He led every major receiving category in the NFL at least once. After having retired over 70 years ago, he remains in the career top 15 major receiving category for the Rams franchise.\nIn 2005, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association's third HOVG class.\nIn 2008, sports historian, writer, statistician, and archivist Sean Lahman had Benton ranked as 54th best wide receiver in the history of the NFL in his award-winning book \"The Pro Football Historical Abstract / A Hardcore Fan's Guide to All-Time Player Rankings\".\nIn 2010, ESPN.COM rated Jim Benton's 10 catches for 303 yards on Thanksgiving Day against the Detroit Lions as the greatest regular season receiving performance in NFL history.\nIn 2013, Benton was ranked as the 34th best receiver in pro football history by footballperspective.com.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1948, Benton helped coach the Ram receivers, including future Hall of Famer Tom Fears. Also, in later years, at the request of George Halas, he helped coach the Bears' receivers.\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Benton was head football coach at Arkansas Agricultural and Mechanical College—now known University of Arkansas at Monticello— leading the team to their first ever Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference (AIC) title in 1953 with a record of 7–1. He was named the AIC coach of the year in 1953 by the \"Arkansas Democrat\".\nAfter coaching, Benton went into the oil business.\nHall of Fame.\nBenton was inducted into the Dallas County Sports Hall of Fame, the UAM Sports Hall of Fame, The Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor, The Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame, and, in 1997 was named a Living Legend of Southeast Conference football. He was named to the Arkansas Razorback All Century Team, the Rams All Time Team and the Pro Football Hall of Fame 1940s All Decade Team."

        "text": "Robert John Murdoch (November 20, 1946 – August 3, 2023) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and coach. \nEarly life.\nMurdoch was born in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, a mining community far from Southern Ontario in Timiskaming District. He grew up in nearby Larder Lake and played organized hockey in this area that saw many players go to the NHL, mainly playing on outdoor rinks. He went to the University of Waterloo where he received a double major degree in Mathematics and Physical Education. He was also captain for the Waterloo Warriors Varsity Ice Hockey team that played in the OUAA. Upon graduation, and undrafted, he played for the Canadian national team in 1968–69 and in 1969–70. He was one of many players affected by the withdrawal of the National Team from participating in the 1970 Ice Hockey World Championships.\nNHL career.\nMurdoch played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, Atlanta Flames and Calgary Flames and coached 10 seasons in the NHL serving as head coach for Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets, and also serving as assistant coach for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks. He won the Stanley Cup in 1971 and 1973 while with Montreal.\nCoaching career.\nMurdoch coached 80 games with the Chicago Blackhawks during the 1987–88 season, compiling a record of 30–41–9. He was succeeded as Blackhawks head coach by Mike Keenan the following season.\nDuring the 1989–90 season, Murdoch was named the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets. After missing the playoffs the previous season, the Jets went 37–32–11 for 85 points and third in the Smythe Division, making the 1990 Stanley Cup playoffs but losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion, the Edmonton Oilers, in seven games. Murdoch was seen as an important part of the Jets quick turn around, winning the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year.\nDespite the success of the previous season, however, the Jets struggled in the 1990–91 season, finishing last in the Smythe Division with a 26–43–11 record, and missing the playoffs. Murdoch was fired at the end of the season and was replaced by John Paddock.\nMurdoch would become an associate coach for the San Jose Sharks during the 1991–92 and 1992–93 seasons. \nAfterwards, he departed for Europe, and coached several teams in Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), including Munich Mad Dogs, Cologne Sharks, and Nurnberg Ice Tigers, retiring in 2002.\nLater life and death.\nWhile he was proud of his Northeastern Ontario roots, Murdoch and his family spent summers near Lake of the Woods in Northwestern Ontario. In later years, Canmore, Alberta was home, where he was diagnosed in 2019 with Lewy Body Dementia, and died in Calgary, Alberta on August 3, 2023, at the age of 76. In March 2024, Murdoch's family announced that he was posthumously diagnosed with stage-3 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)."

He served as the head football coach at Miami University from 1978 to 1982 and at North Carolina State University from 1983 to 1985, compiling a career head coaching record of 43–43–2.\nEarly life and playing career.\nReed studied at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, graduating in 1967. There, he played two season for the Miami Redskins under Bo Schembechler. He recorded 38 and 34 rushing yards in 1964 and 1966, respectively.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant (1967–1977).\nAfter graduating, Reed remained at his alma mater and took up his first coaching role as graduate assistant for the Redskins. He then became the defensive line coach for the Akron Zips from 1969 to 1972. After a brief stint as defensive back coach with the Arizona Wildcats, he went back to coaching defensive line with the Michigan Wolverines in 1974. He served for three seasons in that capacity, his final assistant role before becoming head coach.\nMiami (1978–1982).\nReed served as the head coach at Miami University from 1978 to 1982, replacing Dick Crum who became the North Carolina Tar Heels coach. His best seasons came in 1978 (where he inherited 15 starters and 30 returning players) and 1981, when he led the Redskins to 8–2–1 records. Reed's squads orchestrated several big upset wins including a victory over North Carolina during the 1978 season and a victory over Kentucky in Lexington in 1979. Reed had four winning seasons in five years and tallied a career record of 34–19–2 at Miami. After the 1981 season, Reed accepted the head coaching position at NC State and was replaced by Tim Rose.\nNC State (1983–1985).\nReed was appointed as head coach at North Carolina State University on December 22, 1982, succeeding Monte Kiffin who became linebacker coach for the Green Bay Packers. During his tenure with the Wolfpack, Reed raised the school's recruiting to a national level and ameliorated the team's academic standing within the institution. However, he never had a winning season in three years and compiled a record of 9–24 with the Wolfpack. He also feuded with Bruce Poulton – the university's chancellor at the time – over freshman athletic eligibility, as well as over the school administration's support for the team.\nIt was predicted that Reed would be dismissed at the conclusion of the 1985 season, despite having two years remaining on his contract. However, he pre-empted this by resigning suddenly on December 13, 1985, after losing to North Carolina in the final game of the regular season. He ultimately agreed to a financial settlement, and was succeeded by Dick Sheridan two weeks later. Reed subsequently went back to Michigan, serving as its defensive assistant from 1987 to 1991.\nLater life.\nAfter retiring from coaching, Reed returned to the Research Triangle and managed an executive-search consultant business that he established. He resided in that area until his death.\nReed died on September 26, 2022, at a retirement facility in Zebulon, North Carolina. He was 77 years old."

It was founded as the Society of Golfers at Aberdeen, and became the Aberdeen Golf Club in 1815 subsequently receiving royal patronage in 1903.\nRoyal Aberdeen is best known for hosting the 2005 Senior British Open, the 2011 Walker Cup, and the 2014 Scottish Open.\nHistory.\nAberdeen can be closely linked to the origins of golf, the earliest reference to a golf hole in Scotland was made in local Aberdeen records dating back to 1625. Royal Aberdeen Golf Club was initially set up as The Society of Golfers at Aberdeen in 1780 making it the sixth oldest golf club in the world.\nThe club continued be known as The Society of Golfers at Aberdeen before forming The Aberdeen Golf Club in 1815. The club continued to play over The Queens Links area of Aberdeen where the original golf hole in 1625 was believed to have been. In 1976 play was expanded over the Kings Links area to the north of the Queens Links. Golf is still played to date on this land at the King's Links Golf Club.\nThe club moved to its present location at Ballgownie Links on the other side of the River Don estuary in 1888. The course gained its royal patronage from King Edward VII in 1903 and subsequently changed its name to Royal Aberdeen Golf Club.\nThe course was originally designed by Archie Simpson and Robert Simpson but was later re-bunkered and lengthened to its current layout by James Braid.\nSince its expansion Royal Aberdeen has hosted many top golf tournaments both on an amateur and professional level including the Scottish Open, Senior British Open and the Walker Cup.\nBalgownie.\nThe course runs essentially out and back along the North Sea shore. The outward nine (which is acknowledged as one of the finest in links golf anywhere in the world) cuts its way through some wonderful dune formation. The inland nine returns south over the flatter plateau. A traditional old Scottish links, it is well-bunkered with undulating fairways. It has an excellent balance of holes, strong par 4's, tricky par 3's and two classic par 5's, with the 8th (signature hole) protected by nine bunkers. The ever-changing wind, tight-protected greens and a magnificent finish makes Balgownie a test for the very best. It was highly praised by participants in the 2005 Senior British Open.\nQuotes.\nThe eminent golf writer Sam McKinlay was moved to say \"\"There are few courses in these islands with a better, more testing, more picturesque outward nine than Balgownie\".\"\nAnd this from none other than Bernard Darwin\" \"it represented a huge gap in my golfing education not to have played Balgownie until now, much more than a good golf course, a noble links!\"\"\nScorecards.\nThe scorecard of the Balgownie course is as follows (all distances are given in yards)\nSource\nSilverburn Course.\nThe Silverburn Course is the second course at Royal Aberdeen Golf Course and measures over a par of 64\nTournaments hosted.\nDuring its history Royal Aberdeen has hosted a number of top amateur and professional tournaments, between 1924 and 1980 the club hosted the Scottish Amateur seven times (1924, 1929, 1933, 1948, 1957, 1970, and 1980).

He scored the first goal in NHL history, on December 19, 1917, as a member of the Wanderers in a game against the Toronto Arenas.\nPlaying career.\nRitchie started out his amateur career with the Montreal Westmount in his hometown of Montreal, and would later join the Grand-Mère Hockey Club in the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union. Grand-Mère had one of the better amateur sides in hockey in the early to mid 1910s, with Ritchie as one of its key players, and in 1913–14 they played for the Allan Cup against the Regina Victorias, losing out in the final series 5 goals to 10 (4-6, 1-4).\nRitchie turned professional in 1914 when he signed as a free agent with the Quebec Bulldogs of the National Hockey Association. In three years with Quebec he had 43 points in 56 games. He scored a career high of 17 goals in 1916–17 and finished seventh in league scoring.\nThe 1916–17 season was the last season of the NHA's existence and the Bulldogs suspended operations for two years. The team's players were dispersed among the new teams in the NHL, and Ritchie was selected by the Montreal Wanderers. He scored the first goal in National Hockey League history in the league's first game, between the Wanderers and the Toronto Arenas on December 19, 1917. A couple of weeks later, on January 2, 1918, the Wanderers' home rink, the Montreal Arena, was destroyed in a fire. The team withdrew from the league and Ritchie was selected by the Ottawa Senators, with whom he played the remainder of the season.\nIn the middle of the 1918–19 NHL season, on January 17, 1919, Ritchie signed with the Toronto Arenas and played in four of the club's remaining ten games. Before the start of the 1919–20 NHL season, he was transferred to the Quebec Bulldogs, who had resumed operations and joined the NHL. Ritchie played in all but one of the team's 24 games that season and scored six goals. At the end of the 1919–20 season the Bulldogs moved to Hamilton, Ontario and were renamed the Tigers. The Tigers traded Ritchie to the Montreal Canadiens before the start of the 1920–21 season. He played only six games that season and quit to become a referee. He returned to the Canadiens in 1924 and played seven games over the next two seasons.\nDave Ritchie died in Montreal in 1973."

He was a member of the 1912 Quebec Bulldogs Stanley Cup championship team, playing eleven seasons for the Bulldogs in the period from 1905–06 until 1919–20.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Quebec City, Quebec, McDonald played intermediate hockey for the Quebec Crescents in 1905–06, moving to the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association's Quebec Bulldogs for three games. Except for the 1910 season when the Quebec team did not operate due to the failure of the Canadian Hockey Association, McDonald was a member of the Bulldogs until 1912. He was a member of the 1912 Quebec Stanley Cup champion squad.\nAfter the 1912 NHA season, McDonald played in an exhibition of NHA All-Stars out west against the PCHA All-Stars. He signed with the Vancouver Millionaires for the 1913 season, returning east to play for the new Toronto Ontarios for the 1913–14 season He returned to the Bulldogs in December 1914, and stayed with the club until 1917, when the NHA was suspended, and Quebec suspended operations.\nIn the new NHL, McDonald was picked up by the Montreal Wanderers. McDonald was one of 12 players who were members of the 1917–18 Wanderers' squad. The Wanderers home arena was destroyed by fire only 6 games into the 22 game schedule. This event forced the league to disperse the Wanderers players via a draft to 1 of the remaining 3 teams (Toronto, Montreal Canadiens and Ottawa Senators) in the National Hockey League. McDonald was picked up by the Montreal Canadiens for whom he played until 1919, including the ill-fated 1919 Stanley Cup Finals which was cancelled after five games (tied at 2-2, with one tied game) because of the Spanish flu pandemic. McDonald was one of the Canadiens players seriously ill with the flu when the series was called off. His teammate Joe Hall would succumb to the illness.\nThe following season, in 1919–20, Quebec activated its franchise, and he was 'returned' to Quebec by the Canadiens. He played in Quebec's final season in the NHA of 1919–20. The following season, the Quebec franchise was moved to Hamilton and McDonald was traded back to the Canadiens. He split the 1920–21 season with Montreal and the Toronto St. Pats, loaned there by the NHL in an attempt to make all teams competitive. McDonald's final season was in 1921–22 with the Canadiens, suiting up for only three games.\nTransactions.\nSource: "

        "title": "Midnight basketball",
        "text": "Midnight basketball is an initiative which developed in the 1990s to curb inner-city crime in the United States by keeping urban youth off the streets and engaging them with alternatives to drugs and crime. It was founded by G. Van Standifer in the late 1980s. Young people aged from 14 to 29, mostly men of various minority groups, could go and play basketball during the peak crime hours of 22:00 to 02:00, immediately, thereafter, attending informative programs that gave them helpful skills for everyday life. It was a way for young men to form a sense of community, get out of a dangerous environment, and give them a sense of hope for the future. Midnight basketball helped decrease crime in the neighbourhoods where it was run, and it was a positive outlet for many young men. It helped many stay out of trouble and off the streets. By 2019, various cities in the United States brought back the program.\nHistory.\nThe beginnings of midnight basketball.\nMidnight basketball began in Glenarden, Maryland, in 1986, when crack cocaine first came to Washington. The program was started when Van Standifer noticed that the crime rates were incredibly high especially during the hours of 10 pm and 2 am. He observed that young men had nothing to do, as many did not have jobs, were living in poverty and could not always afford to do something. He opened Glenarden Recreation Center, funded by both private donations and public funds. They ran during those specific hours, where young men could come and play basketball. It was run by volunteers and supervised by officers to make sure everything was alright. Even the officers complimented how well the programs were working and what a benefit it was to the community. Afterwards, participants would have to attend workshops that informed them about different necessities for living. It lowered crime rates in the area, and the programs were found to be incredibly helpful to the young men. Soon other communities saw the merit in the program and started to adopt Midnight Basketball themselves. It was later added to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and was signed by President Bill Clinton.\nThe Crime Bill.\nIn 1994, Bill Clinton pushed for an anti-crime bill that would lead to 100,000 more police officers as well as a number of programs intended to \"deter crime where it starts\" by providing \"community activities like midnight basketball.\" At the time of its inception, despite being racially coded, it was a relatively unknown and uncontroversial piece of policy innovation. However, once President Clinton's anti-crime bill was being debated about five years after the creation of Midnight Basketball, it became a highly contentious part of the bill. This was striking because the initiative only made up $50 million of the original $33 billion bill. Midnight Basketball's initiative was already racially coded, so when lawmakers were discussing whether it was a positive or negative part of this massive bill, it was part of a covert racial dialogue. It was argued that race was the key to midnight basketball's importance. The influence of the media associating crimes with African Americans actually made crime seem more dangerous, and there was more want for anti-crime programs.\nReception.\nThe plan was widely criticized by conservatives such as House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, who cited midnight basketball as an ineffective and wasteful use of federal funds. Some, such as Rush Limbaugh, even called the proposal racist, given the largely African American populations targeted by the program. Midnight basketball was not a proposal unique to the Democrats as it was one of George H. W. Bush's \"thousand points of light\". It was also argued that violence portrayed in the media could influence young African American men and actually raise the crime rate, so there was some action taken to try to reduce the crime and violence shown to the younger generation. When Midnight Basketball was discussed in the media in relation to the anti-crime bill, 98.2 percent of the time it was being shown negatively was when it was coming from an identifiable conservative-Republican. On the other hand, when a liberal-Democratic source discussed it, it was shown in a positive light 97.9 percent of the time. It was even referred to as social engineering by some Republican opponents. Midnight Basketball became the symbol of the overall anti-crime bill struggle. Specifically, it allowed racial issues to be explicitly talked about, and because Midnight Basketball was almost completely for crime prevention in minorities, it helped make young African-American men the face of crime.\nPrograms.\nEither before or after participants would play in their basketball games, they would have to attend informal workshops or programs on different life skills. Programs would be aimed to provide assistance and advice to different groups of young people, mostly male minorities, including the unemployed, impoverished, ex-convicts, and young males. The programs goals were to help young people get to a place where they would be self-sufficient and well-versed in how to act and live successfully, while staying away from violent or harmful situations. It helped many young men who went back to school, and got jobs, all while staying off the streets.\nThe Service Categories.\nThe main focus of the programs include:\nA list of some content of different sessions include:\nThe volunteers work hard to make sure they do everything they can to provide for the young men, and the programs have helped to give hope to its participants. It has also helped save many lives, and help them into a more successful environment.\nEffectiveness.\nEmpirically, a 2006 study of the 1990-1994 period during which rates of most crimes in the United States peaked, and when urban midnight basketball programs were initiated as a crime-prevention strategy, found that—while confounding factors were likely involved—property crime rates fell more rapidly in cities that were early adopters of the original midnight basketball model than in other American cities in the same period. It shows that there was a drop in crime rates in places where these programs were taking place. There was a 30% drop in crime in Glenarden, where the program began, and Phoenix had 10.4% less juvenile arrests and 50% less juvenile related incidents. In one \"Los Angeles Times\" article, it is stated that \"There was a 60% reduction in drug-related crime.\" Although there was uncertainty about this statistic, as the Chicago leagues had only 160 participants and there were still around 85,000 young adults across the city that were at risk, which made the statistics seem unrealistic. Participants were not at risk of committing a crime when they attended basketball, and there were police officers stationed in the building to make sure of this. An article from Texas stated that it \"has cut crime in one Fort Worth neighborhood 89 percent on nights when games are held.\" As well, \"Murders, rapes, robberies and burglaries dropped to zero during the late-night games.\" The program helps show the young men a sense of community, friendship, and sportsmanship that they wouldn't have gotten to experience on the streets. There are some people who believed that it would actually increase crime because it would bring at-risk people into a group together, and it might encourage gangs. However, this is not the case, and the program has been very successful, and a program has even started in Australia. It has helped give young men an alternative to crime, and many have found jobs or are seeking further education.\nRevival.\nBy 2019, various cities in the United States had brought back their midnight basketball programs."

In ascending order of age participation, here are a few examples:\nYouth baseball.\nYouth baseball is played by elementary-school-age and high-school-age children of both genders. Of the various leagues listed below, Little League baseball is the most widespread. The Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, draws participants from around the world and is televised in the US on ESPN.\nNational Youth Baseball Championship.\nThe first annual National Youth Baseball Championships (NYBC) tournament was held in August 2008 for players in two divisions: 10U and 12U. The purpose of the tournament is to recognize one team as the \"National Youth Baseball Champion.\" The tournament organizer is the Major Youth Baseball Alliance, LLC, which was formed by eight major national youth baseball organizations, whose programs have more than eight million participants. The eight organizations are: AABC (American Amateur Baseball Congress), AAU (Amateur Athletic Union of the United States), Babe Ruth Baseball, Dixie Youth Baseball, NABF (National Amateur Baseball Federation), Pony Baseball, Super Series Baseball of America, and USSSA (United States Specialty Sports Association).\nNational all-stars tournament.\nFrom 1998 (or earlier) through 2010 (or later), there has been an annual, national all-stars tournament each June — the USA Baseball Tournament of Stars; its predecessor was the National Amateur All-Star Baseball Tournament (NAABT).

        "text": "The 54th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Saturday, May 30, 1970.\nAl Unser, Sr. dominated the race, winning the pole position and leading 190 laps en route to victory. He joined his brother Bobby as the first duo of brothers to win the Indianapolis 500; it was the first of his four victories at Indianapolis. Car owner Parnelli Jones, who won the race as a driver in 1963, became the second individual (after Pete DePaolo) to win separately as both a driver and as an owner.\nUnser turned 31 a day earlier and took home $271,697 out of a record $1,000,002 purse. For the first time in Indy history, the total prize fund topped a million dollars.\nRain on race morning delayed the start by about thirty minutes. On the pace lap, Jim Malloy smacked the outside wall in turn four, which delayed the start further.\nAll 33 cars in the field were turbocharged for the first time. This was the final 500 in which the winner celebrated in the old Victory Lane at the south end of the pits; it was relocated nearer the finish line for 1971.\nRace schedule.\nThe race start time was scheduled for 12:00 noon local time, a slight departure from the traditional 11:00 am start time that was used during most of the 1960s. With the race scheduled for Saturday May 30, Speedway management announced that Sunday May 31 would be the designated rain date, the first time the race would be permitted to run on a Sunday. However, despite a brief rain delay on race morning, the full 500 miles was completed Saturday, and Sunday was not needed.\nThis would be the last Indy 500 that was scheduled for the traditional fixed date of May 30. Through 1970, Memorial Day was a fixed date holiday observed on May 30 regardless of the day of the week. For 1970, the date of May 30 fell on a Saturday. From 1911 to 1970, the race was scheduled for May 30, regardless of the day of the week, unless May 30 fell on a Sunday. In those cases, the race would be scheduled for Monday May 31. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act would take effect in 1971, and for 1971 and 1972, the race would be scheduled for the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. In 1973, it was scheduled for Monday (but rain delayed it until Wednesday). From 1974 onward, it was scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. From 1974 onward, the race would only be held on May 30 if that date fell on a Sunday.\nThe annual Carburetion Days practice session, along with pit stop practice, on Wednesday May 27 was closed to the public.\nPractice and time trials.\nAl Unser, Sr. set the fastest speed during practice, with a lap of 171.233 mph. Unser led the speed chart on five of the practice days, and was the only driver to crack the 170 mph barrier during the first two weeks. A. J. Foyt (169.173 mph) and Art Pollard (169.1 mph) were close behind.\nJohn Cannon wrecked on Sunday May 10, and was unable to qualify. On Monday May 11, defending race winner Mario Andretti spun and wrecked in turn four. His car hit the inside wall twice, and the car was heavily damaged. Andretti was not injured.\nOn Tuesday May 12, Dennis Hulme's car caught fire in turn three. He bailed from the moving machine, suffering burns to his hands and feet. He withdrew due to the injuries.\nPole Day – Saturday May 16.\nAl Unser, Sr. won the pole position over Johnny Rutherford by 0.01 seconds, a record closest margin for the pole position at the time. A. J. Foyt rounded out the \"all over 170 mph\" front row. Unser's pole speed of 170.221 mph (his fastest single lap was 170.358 mph) was not a record – which marked the first time since the 1940s that two consecutive years went by without track records set during time trials at Indy.\nRain halted pole day qualifying at 3:42 p.m. with 17 cars in the field . A few cars (namely Lloyd Ruby, Gary Bettenhausen, and Peter Revson) were still waiting in line when the rains came. USAC officials closed the track for the day, and those cars were deemed ineligible for the pole round. In subsequent years, the rules would be changed to allow all cars in the original qualifying draw order at least one chance to make an attempt during the pole round, regardless if it extended into an additional calendar day due to rain.\nRookie Tony Adamowicz suffered bad luck during his attempt. On his first qualifying lap, the yellow light was turned on by error. He slowed down, and his first lap was turned in at 160.829 mph. The green light came back on moments later, and he completed the run. Although he had two laps over 166 mph, his first lap pulled his average down to 164.820 mph, and made him the second-slowest car in the field for the day.\nSecond Day – Sunday May 17.\nThree drivers shut out from the pole round came back to qualify on the second day. Peter Revson (167.942 mph) was the 9th-fastest car in the field, but lined up 18th due to being a second day qualifier. Lloyd Ruby went out for his first attempt, but when he raised his hand to signify the intent to start his attempt, the officials did not see it, and inadvertently waved him off. After he persuaded the officials for a do-over, he had a lap of 169.428 mph, but burned a piston on the fourth and final lap. The incident drew the ire of the team, as they felt the officials cost them a chance to be the day's fastest qualifier (for having run the extra laps). Ruby went out again later in the day with a new engine, but waved off after one slow lap.\nThird Day – Saturday May 23.\nAfter a disappointing first weekend, Lloyd Ruby rebounded to complete his qualifying attempt at 168.895 mph. A busy day saw 14 attempts, and the field was filled to 33 cars. Two drivers (Bentley Warren and Tony Adamowicz) were bumped.\nBump Day – Sunday May 24.\nJim McElreath put the fourth Foyt entry in the field, bumping Bartlett. No other cars, however, were able to show enough speed to make the field. Jigger Sirois, infamous for missing the 1969 race, fell far short in Jack Adam's Turbine car.\nRace recap.\nStart.\nRain delayed the start of the race by about 25 minutes. On the final pace lap, the field was coming through turn four to take the green flag. Suddenly, Jim Malloy on the outside of the third row, suffered a rear suspension failure, and smacked the outside wall. His car veered across the track to the inside, but narrowly avoided contact with any other car. The field was halted on the mainstretch under the red flag to clean up the accident. During the delay, teams were permitted to top off their fuel tanks, after burning three laps of methanol.\nThe field was restarted after the red flag, and 32 cars took the green flag. Johnny Rutherford swept across to take the lead into turn one. Down the backstretch, Al Unser, Sr. tucked in behind, and took the lead going into turn three. Unser led the first lap.\nLloyd Ruby, who started 25th, notably passed ten cars on the first lap. By the third lap, Ruby was in the top ten.\nFirst half.\nThe early laps focused on the mad charge of Lloyd Ruby, who was up to 5th place by about lap 28. The yellow flag came out when Art Pollard blew an engine. Under the caution, Mario Andretti was forced to make an unscheduled pit stop to repair loose bodywork. He rejoined the race, but lost many positions.\nAs the race passed the 100-mile mark, Al Unser, Sr. led, with Johnny Rutherford running second, and A. J. Foyt and Lloyd Ruby battling for third.\nAl Unser, Sr. led the first 48 laps. He gave up the lead to A. J. Foyt during a pit stop on lap 49. One lap later, Foyt entered the pits, giving the lead to Lloyd Ruby. Suddenly Ruby was given the black flag for smoke due to broken drive gears. Ruby's dramatic race was over after completing only 54 laps. Meanwhile, Johnny Rutherford stalled exiting the pits, losing considerable track position.\nUnser re-took the lead on lap 54, and led until the halfway point. Mario Andretti once again had to make an unscheduled pit stop, this time to change the right rear tire. Through most of the race, he was experiencing handling issues with the right rear suspension.\nSecond half.\nAl Unser moved back to the front on lap 106, and he would not relinquish the lead. Johnny Rutherford, who was a factor in the first half, dropped out after 135 laps due to a broken header.\nRoger McCluskey, who had dropped out on lap 62 with suspension damage, relieved Mel Kenyon on lap 112.\nOn lap 172, Roger McCluskey (driving for Kenyon), spun going into turn three, and crashed hard into the outside wall. Ronnie Bucknum was collected in the crash. Sammy Sessions locked up the brakes and nearly slid into the crashed cars. Sessions gained control, weaved his way through, and continued in the race. Spilled fuel started pouring from one of the crashed cars, and a small fire broke out. As the field approached the scene, several cars got into the fluid and spun. Wally Dallenbach and Jack Brabham spun but continued. Mario Andretti nearly spun out, but he made it through the scene unscathed. The fire was quickly extinguished, but what turned out to be the final yellow light of the race was on for over 14 minutes (lap 172 through lap 181) to clear the track.\nFinish.\nWith about 25 laps to go, Al Unser, Sr. had lapped the entire field. Unser's crew gave him the \"E-Z\" sign on his chalkboard, and both Mark Donohue and A. J. Foyt got their lap back.\nWith Unser leading comfortably, the focus became the battle for second between Mark Donohue and A. J. Foyt. With only a handful of laps left, Foyt suddenly slowed in turn one. He pulled to the apron, but stayed out on the track attempting to nurse the car to the finish line.\nAl Unser, Sr. led a total of 190 laps en route to his first Indy victory. Unser won by 32.19 seconds over second place Mark Donohue, over three minutes over third place Dan Gurney in his final 500 a driver. A very slow A. J. Foyt fell to 10th in the final standings.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer for the 23rd consecutive year. Len Sutton served as \"driver expert\" for the fifth year. At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. The entire on-air crew remained mostly consistent from 1966 to 1969. The broadcast came on-air at 11:30 am local time, with a thirty-minute pre-race show scheduled. However, the rain delay increased the pre-race coverage to almost an hour. After the death of Bill Dean, Jack Morrow assumed the role of producer.\nThe broadcast was carried by over 1,000 affiliates in all fifty states, AFN, the CBC, and reached locations such as Vietnam and had four foreign language translations. The broadcast had an estimated 120 million listeners worldwide.\nAmong the celebrity interviews Sid Collins conducted in the booth were Edie Adams, Dennis Hulme, Billy Shaw, Chris Economaki (ABC Sports), Larry Bisceglia, Sam Hanks, Pete DePaolo, Bill Holland, Senator Vance Hartke, Tony Hulman, Duke Nalon, Johnnie Parsons, and J. C. Agajanian. Astronaut Pete Conrad, who was a fellow passenger with Tony Hulman in the pace car for the second year in a row, was also interviewed during the pre-race coverage.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\". The broadcast aired on Saturday June 6. Jim McKay anchored the broadcast with Rodger Ward and Chris Economaki as analysts. Ward drove the pace car at the start of the race. It was the last time the \"500\" was not seen on over-the-air television the day of the race.\nFor the final time, the race was shown live on MCA closed-circuit television in numerous theaters across the United States. Charlie Brockman served as anchor.\nThe \"Wide World Of Sports\" broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic starting in May 2011."

        "text": "Dick Crum (born April 29, 1934) is a former American football player and coach. He served as head football coach at Miami University from 1974 to 1977, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1978 to 1987, and Kent State University from 1988 to 1990, compiling a career college football head coaching record of 113–77–4. Crum is a 1957 graduate of Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio and received a master's degree from Case Western Reserve University.\nEarly years.\nCrum was born in Boardman. He attended Boardman High School\n Crum played football, mostly as a backup, at both Muskingum College and Mount Union College before graduating from the latter in 1957. After graduation, Crum was a teacher and assistant football coach at several high schools in Ohio, including Boardman, Sandusky, and Warren Harding. Crum's first head coaching job was at Mentor High School in 1963 where he compiled a 50–9–1 record over six years. He moved to the college ranks in 1969 when he was hired as an assistant coach by Bill Mallory at Miami University.\nCollege head coach.\nMiami of Ohio.\nWhen Mallory left for Colorado in 1974, Crum succeeded him as head coach at Miami, a post he held until 1977. He orchestrated several upset wins including victories over Kentucky in 1974, Purdue in 1975, and Indiana in 1977. Crum had three winning seasons in four years and won the Mid-American Conference three times. In his first two years, he led the Miami to the Tangerine Bowl twice, where they beat Georgia in 1974 and South Carolina in 1975. Those two Miami teams ranked in the final AP Poll at No. 10 in 1974 and No. 12 in 1975. In 1976, Miami's performance fell dramatically with a 3–8 finish. The team rebounded the next year with a 10–1 record. After the 1977 season, Crum accepted the head coaching position at North Carolina and was replaced by Tom Reed. During his four years at Miami, Crum developed future NFL standouts Rob Carpenter and Sherman Smith, future Miami and Northwestern head coach Randy Walker, and former Illinois head coach Ron Zook. Crum finished his stint at Miami with a record of 34–10–1.\nNorth Carolina.\nCrum was hired as head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1978, succeeding Bill Dooley. His finest season there came in 1980 when he led the Tar Heels to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship—their last conference title to date—and an 11–1 record capped by victory over Texas in the Bluebonnet Bowl. At North Carolina, Crum coached a number of future NFL players, including Lawrence Taylor, Harris Barton, Reuben Davis and Kelvin Bryant.\nCrum's later North Carolina teams were not quite as talented as his earlier ones; after 1983 he would have only one winning season. He was fired at the end of the 1987 season and was succeeded by Mack Brown. Crum finished his career at North Carolina with a record of 72–41–3, though he only won 22 games in his final four seasons. He was the winningest coach in school history until Mack Brown (in his second tenure at North Carolina) surpassed him after a game against Duke in 2019.\nKent State.\nCrum served as the head coach at Kent State University from 1988 to 1990. He never put together a winning season in three years with the Golden Flashes and compiled a record of 7–26."

        "title": "Sidearm (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, sidearm is a motion for throwing a ball along a low, approximately horizontal plane rather than a high, mostly vertical plane (overhand).\nSidearm is a common way of throwing the ball in the infield, because many throws must be made hurriedly from the glove after fielding ground balls. An infielder's quickest throw to the bases is often from just above ground level, necessitating a horizontal release of the ball.\nSidearm pitchers, also known as sidewinders, are uncommon at all levels of baseball except in Japan, where sidearm pitchers are widely popular. Few find sidearm a natural delivery, and those who do are often discouraged by coaches who know little about sidearm mechanics, and who believe that overhand pitching affords greater velocity. This is generally true, since overhand pitching provides better mechanical leverage with which the body can use to accelerate the ball. But what the sidearm pitcher loses in velocity, they gain in ball movement and unusual release point.\nHistorical progression of pitching.\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, the game of baseball began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. As the game progressed towards professionalism and became more serious, pitchers began to attempt to prevent the batter from hitting the ball by throwing faster pitches. The rules governing the delivery of pitches proved to be hard to enforce, and pitchers continued to stretch the boundaries of the rules until by the 1870s, the release point of pitches had reached the pitcher's waist level. As the game continued to evolve into the 20th century, pitchers' release points continued to rise to present day levels, although some adherents continued to use the sidearm delivery.\nBall movement.\nThe various spins pitchers commonly employ—fastballs, curveballs, sliders, cutters—cause the ball to diverge from a \"normal\" trajectory. This is caused by the Magnus effect, which makes the ball move in the direction of its rotation. Batters learn these spins and their likely trajectories, but predominantly from high-axis pitchers whose pitches rotate around a mostly horizontal axis. Sidearm pitches rotate similarly, but around an approximately vertical axis. This causes common pitches to behave very uncommonly. For example, the four-seam fastball, when thrown by overhand power pitchers, seems to \"hop\", or rise on its way to the plate. This is because the ball is rotating backwards, lowering the air pressure above the ball. The same pitch thrown by the sidearm pitcher causes a horizontal rotation, and consequent sideways movement. Sidearm pitchers whose deliveries are below the horizontal throw a fastball that rotates nearly forward, so the ball will sink rather than rise.\nRelease point.\nSidewinders' unusual release points make it difficult for the batter to \"see\" the ball because hitters are so accustomed to seeing the release from near the pitcher's head. Further, because the ball is released from alongside the rubber (and some sidearm pitchers step a little toward their pitching arm side when they deliver the ball) it can appear to a same-side batter that the ball has been thrown at him.\nThese characteristics have typecast today's sidearm pitchers as relievers, entering the game in the late innings as a \"different look\" from overhand pitchers. Though this is an effective strategy, some of the greatest starting pitchers in baseball history, notably Walter Johnson, Satchel Paige, Don Drysdale, Carl Mays, Dizzy Dean, and Randy Johnson, threw the ball sidearm.\nOther prominent major leaguer sidewinders include, or have included, Madison Bumgarner, Chris Sale, Jimmy Herget, Scott Feldman, Pat Neshek, Scott Sauerbeck, Dennis Eckersley, Mark Eichhorn, Javier López, Jake Peavy, Vinnie Pestano, Ted Abernathy, Gene Garber, Dave Baldwin, and Bob Locker. Still others such as Jered Weaver, Bronson Arroyo, David Cone, and Tom Henke would sometimes \"drop down\" to a sidearm delivery to fool a batter for a strikeout.\nIt is most common to hear that sidearm pitching places less stress on the elbow and shoulder, thus reducing a pitcher's risk of injury. It is also not uncommon to hear the opposite. Analyses of pitchers' deliveries shows that arms slots are a function of shoulder tilt, not elbow angle, and this suggests that no one arm slot poses a greater threat to the elbow than another. It is likely, however, that pitchers who throw overhand are more susceptible to hyperabduction and concomitant rotator cuff problems, because they more easily throw the ball with the elbow higher than the level of the shoulders.\nIn American football.\nSidearm throwing is uncommon amongst quarterbacks in the NFL as it may not have enough arc to throw over the defenders, but relies on strong and quick wrist movements to generate power and throwing under and around blitzing defensive linemen and linebackers. Rich Gannon, Michael Vick, Philip Rivers, Aaron Rodgers, Matthew Stafford, Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson are notable sidearm quarterbacks."

        "text": "George Oliver Barclay (May 16, 1876 – April 3, 1909) was an American football and baseball player. He played Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and later the Boston Beaneaters. He was also an early professional football player-coach for the Greensburg Athletic Association. He was nicknamed \"The Rose\" for his concern with his looks and \"Deerfoot\" because of his speed. Barclay also invented the first football helmet.\nBaseball career.\nMinor leagues.\nBarclay began his professional baseball career in 1896 with the Chambersburg Maroons in the independent Cumberland Valley League. He continued to play both football and minor league baseball. In 1901, he batted .335 for the Rochester Bronchos of the Eastern League, earning him a look from the Cardinals.\nCardinals.\nBarclay was 25 years old when he broke into the big leagues on April 17, 1902, with the St. Louis Cardinals. Two of the team's starting outfielders, Jesse Burkett and Emmet Heidrick, had jumped to the rival St. Louis Browns of the new American League, and Barclay, along with Doc Smoot, were acquired to replace them, with Barclay becoming the everyday left fielder. Both men hit over .300 that year, as did their manager and outfield mate Patsy Donovan, but the Cardinals still fell from fourth to sixth.\nIn 1903, although Smoot continued to play well, Barclay's production fell off, batting just .248. Still, he was brought back to be the team's starting left fielder in 1904. His performance continued to decline, and he was batting just .200 when he was sold to the Boston Beaneaters on September 11, 1904, having been replaced by rookie Hugh Hill.\nBeaneaters and return to the minors.\nBarclay was moved to right field by the Beaneaters, and his average bounced back a bit to .226 during his time with Boston. He started the 1905 season back in left field, but after batting just .176 in 29 games he was replaced by Jim Delahanty and eventually released on May 22, 1905.\nBarclay returned to Rochester to finish the 1905 season, but he never regained his previous level of performance, as he batted .245 that year, then just .190 in 1906. After one more season with the class-B Lynn Shoemakers of the New England League, batting .207 in 43 games, Barclay left professional baseball.\nFirst football helmet and career.\nBarclay was credited with inventing the first-ever football helmet in 1894, with the intention that it would prevent cauliflower ears. The helmet was constructed by a saddle-maker from nearby Easton with strips of leather harness padding. It attracted national attention in a Lafayette game against Penn on Oct. 24, 1896. The NCAA and the National Football League made helmets mandatory in 1939 and in 1941, respectively.\nBarclay was a member of the 1896 Lafayette football team that won the national championship. The next year, he was a player-coach for the Greensburg Athletic Association. He ended the season on the player on that team named to the \"All- Western Pennsylvania\" team by the \"Pittsburgh Press\". A year later, he was chosen by Dave Berry, the manager of the rival Latrobe Athletic Association, to play for the Western Pennsylvania All-Stars in the very first football all-star game, against the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club.\nDeath.\nBarclay died on April 3, 1909, at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He succumbed to peritonitis after an operation for appendicitis. In 1984-85, Barclay was inducted into the Lafayette College Maroon Club Hall of Fame."

Beard, a native of Cincinnati, attended the University of Cincinnati. He stood tall and weighed .\nBeard's 13 big-league appearances included ten starting pitcher assignments, as he took a regular turn in the Cardinals' rotation during late July and August of the 1954 season. Although he lost all four decisions, he made a memorable start on July 22, 1954, against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Busch Stadium. He went 12 innings and allowed only one earned run and eight hits (including a home run by Preston Ward for the Pirates' earned run), but left the game for a pinch hitter with the score tied 2–2. He was relieved by Gerry Staley, who hurled two perfect frames and St. Louis won, 3–2, in 14 innings.\nAs a starter, Beard gave up 29 runs in ten efforts and 49 innings pitched, but only 21 were earned (for a 3.81 earned run average in starting assignments). All told as a Major Leaguer, he surrendered 62 hits and 28 bases on balls in 58 innings pitched, with 17 strikeouts.\nBeard died in West Palm Beach, Florida, on the day before his 74th birthday."

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Čukarica.\nLocation.\nGolf Naselje is a modern settlement in the vicinity of the sport center Košutnjak, the easternmost extension of the Banovo Brdo. It is bordered by the Košutnjak park to the north and east, Sunčana Padina to the south and Banovo Brdo to the west.\nRestaurant Golf.\nPredating the neighborhood, a restaurant was built on top of Košutnjak in c.1930. It was designed by Dragiša Brašovan, as a rustic edifice with cellar, ground floor and a loft. The main façade, facing the garden, is made of 5 large, arched, glassed openings. The middle one serves as the door between the winter salon and summer garden. Main entrance into the restaurant is built on the side of the building.\nIn 1936, golf courses were built around the restaurant, which gave the name to the venue. There were 9 greens and foreign ambassadors considered the courses \"among the most beautiful in Europe\". The initiative for the golf complex, which included the building of the Golf Club, came from the regent, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia.\nThe building was restored in 1946, after World War II. It was originally used as the children's vacation and recuperation facility and restaurant. The venue was to be liquidated so it was taken over by the Hospitality Management Chamber which adapted it into the pre-service training facility for the Masters School in 1955. As number of students grew, the building was annexed with 3 classrooms, 18 rooms and the great hall which continues into the terrace. In 1960 it was renamed Catering School which became part of the Catering Educational Center in 1963. Students were moved from the boarding rooms in Zeleni Venac into the restaurant in 1975, but the school moved out from the restaurant completely in 1978, which continued as a hospitality venue of its own.\nCharacteristics.\nThe whole neighborhood was named after the restaurant.\nAdministration.\nThe neighborhood was mostly organized as the local community, sub-municipal administrative unit, of Blagoje Parović. It had a population of 6,616 in 1981, 7,623 in 1991 and 9,447 in 2002. Prior to the 2011 census, it was merged into the Mihajlovac local community, which includes much wider area."

The Ducks broke a tie in the third period of game four when Ryan Getzlaf scored on the power-play, they went on to add an empty net goal from Rob Niedermayer that gave Anaheim a 5–3 win that tied the series at two games.

From 1917 to 1923, White played with the Barrie Canoe Club, Toronto Canoe Club Paddlers (winning the 1920 Memorial Cup as national junior ice hockey champions), and Dunnville Dunnies of the Ontario Hockey Association. In 1923, after seeing how well the fans in Pittsburgh took to Lionel Conacher, the owner of the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, Roy Schooley asked Conachar to invite a number of his friends in Canada to play for his team. These players included Harold Cotton, Hib Milks, Harold Darragh, Rodger Smith, Duke McCurry, Roy Worters and White. White played for the Yellow Jackets for the next two seasons, helping the team win the United States Amateur Hockey Association title in each of those years. In 1925, the Yellow Jackets morphed into the NHL's Pittsburgh's Pirates. White made the transition to the NHL with several other key members of the team.\nWhite was one of only five Pittsburgh players to play all five seasons for the Pirates. However he played for the New York Americans for 13 games at the end of the 1928-29 NHL season, and sent to the New Haven Eagles, of the Canadian-American Hockey League, for 12 games in 1929-30.When financial issues associated with the Great Depression sent the Pirates across the state to Philadelphia, White stayed with the team, now renamed the Philadelphia Quakers. He scored three goals in his one month playing for the Quakers, with one of those goals being the game winner in the Quakers' first victory, over the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 25, 1930. However White was traded, along with Rodger Smith, to the revived Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets for cash on December 16, 1930, following the Quakers' acquisition of Eddie McCalmon and D'Arcy Coulson. On March 17, 1931, White scored the lone goal for the Yellow Jackets against the London Tecumsehs. The win allowed Pittsburgh to clinch a playoff berth in the International Hockey League. He played in Pittsburgh before retiring from hockey in 1932.\nWhite was found dead in his Canadian Corps Club room, located in Port Colborne, Ontario, on December 2, 1948. He had been working as a steward at the club, for the previous three years."

He won 75 caps with one as captain playing at centre for the Australian rugby union side between 1989 and 2000. He also won caps on the wing later in his career. He would later become one of only 43 players who have won the Rugby World Cup on multiple occasions, however as an Australian achieved this feat first.\nEarly life.\nLittle was born in Dalby, Queensland and attended Toowoomba Grammar School.\nInternational career.\nHe made his test debut at the age of 19 against France 4 November 1989 on the Australian tour to Europe that year and shortly afterwards, he and Tim Horan were subjected to a mock ceremony where they pledged their futures to Rugby Union, promising not to defect to League. Both were to receive numerous offers from league clubs but turned them down.\nIn three quarters of his caps he partnered Horan, who was also his partner at Souths Rugby in Brisbane in the late 1980s and then for Queensland Reds. His nickname was 'Sidney'.\nTogether he and Horan composed a centre partnership for Australia which came to the fore during the Rugby World Cup 1991 (won by Australia) and were widely regarded as the best centres in the world through the early 1990s, adding the Bledisloe Cup to their collection in 1992.\nIn the second Test of the tour against South Africa in 1993, he threw an interception pass which allowed Joel Stransky to run the length of the field and score under the posts. Australia had lost the first Test and the Boks were well up on the score sheet as a result of this and he was later to remark that his immediate reaction was that his career was over. He did however score a try in each half of the game and the Wallabies won the match and eventually the series.\nBy the year 1999, he was no longer an automatic choice for the Test side and made many appearances as a replacement as Daniel Herbert competed with him to partner Horan in the centres. He later moved south to New South Wales Waratahs in 2000 to resurrect his international career, a move which kept him in the test squad and earning him a place and a second winners medal at the Rugby World Cup 1999.\nHis final cap was a victory against South Africa on 26 August 2000 which was won 19-18 in dramatic style.\nAfter retiring from International Rugby, he played briefly in England, firstly for Gloucester Rugby, then for a season as captain of West Country rivals Bristol Rugby, leading them to their first Twickenham appearance for 14 years, before retiring altogether from top-flight rugby.\nPost playing career.\nHaving retired, he undertook a course in Land Management at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. He now lives on the North Shore, in Sydney with his wife Brigitte and three children."

        "text": "John Anthony Gallagher (born 29 January 1964) is a former rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s.\nBorn in England to Irish parents, he moved to New Zealand and played rugby union for New Zealand as a fullback, winning the World Cup in 1987.\nIn 1990, he moved to rugby league, playing for Leeds, and the as a . Gallagher returned to rugby union and played one game for Ireland A in 1996.\nEarly life.\nGallagher was born in Lewisham, London to Irish parents. An enthusiastic Arsenal football supporter, he was introduced to rugby union at his childhood school, St. Joseph's Academy, Blackheath, where he was required by the headmaster to join the team.\nRugby union.\nGallagher first visited New Zealand in 1984 and played for the Oriental Rongotai club in Wellington. He went on to play for the Wellington provincial team, before he returned to England and joined the Metropolitan Police. He subsequently returned to New Zealand and joined the police there, while continuing to play for Wellington. In 1986 Gallagher switched from centre to fullback and his Wellington team won the National Provincial Championship.\nHe was chosen for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, qualifying through permanent residency. He went on to play 41 games (18 test matches) for the All Blacks. Gallagher began with four matches in France in 1986, and continued through the 1987 season, cementing his test match starting spot and winning the inaugural Rugby World Cup that year in Auckland, New Zealand. In 1990 he was named the International Rugby Player of the Year. He did not suffer a loss while representing New Zealand. He is considered by many sources, including the New Zealand Herald and the Telegraph newspapers, to be one of the greatest fullbacks and All Blacks of all time.\nRugby league.\nIn 1990, Gallagher was one of the first of a succession of All Blacks to switch codes to rugby league, following his understudy Matthew Ridge, who signed with the NSWRL's Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles only a week before. Other All Blacks who followed soon after were Frano Botica (Wigan), John Schuster (Newcastle Knights) and two years later Va'aiga Tuigamala (Wigan).\nHe was initially signed by David Ward for Leeds. He was considered one of the fastest players over 30m when he switched to league, and this was put to good early use by Leeds. He was targeted by opposition players in defence and was badly injured in an alleged \"spear tackle\", playing away at St Helens involving Tea Ropati. He may also have found the tactical differences between the two codes difficult to adjust to, particularly in his favoured full-back position and the move was unsuccessful. Perhaps his finest moment for Leeds came in a match against Australia during the Australian teams 1990 Kangaroo tour when he scored the opening try of the game at Headingley. Gallagher's defense came into question later in that game when giant Kangaroo second rower Paul Sironen scored two tries, both times running over the top of him. Following the signings of fullbacks Morvin Edwards and Alan Tait in the 1991–92 season, Gallagher lost his place in the first team.\nGallagher signed a three-year contract for the in July 1993, and played for one season.\nReturn to rugby union.\nAfter his contract with London ended in 1995, and rugby union was turning professional, Gallagher was training with Harlequins in rugby union. In 1995 and 1996 he was involved in training squads for Ireland, and played for Ireland A in the centre against Scotland A in 1996. He also played semi-professionally for Blackheath.\nLater career.\nGallagher took up teaching in 1994 at Colfe's Preparatory School in south-east London. He spent two years as Director of Rugby at Harlequins, from July 1998 to March 2000, before returning to Colfe's, later becoming headteacher there.\nHis son, Matt Gallagher, is a professional player with Bath."

        "text": "Pepper is both a common batting and fielding exercise and a competitive game in baseball, during which one player hits brisk ground balls to a group of fielders who are standing nearby.\nExercise.\nPepper is a common pre-game exercise in which one player hits brisk grounders and line drives to a group of fielders who are standing about twenty feet away. The fielders throw balls to the batter, who uses a short, light swing to hit the ball on the ground towards the fielders. The fielders field the ground balls and continue tossing the ball to the batter. This exercise keeps the fielders and batter alert, and helps to develop quickness and good hand-eye coordination.\nGame.\nPepper is also a competitive game in which a group of fielders stand in a line fifteen to twenty feet away from a batter; one end of the line is the \"front,\" the other the \"back.\" One of the fielders throws the ball to the batter, who attempts to hit grounders to the fielders standing in the line. When a fielder cleanly plays the ball, he throws it back to the batter, generally as quickly as possible; the batter then tries to hit the ball again to the fielders. If the fielder makes an error in fielding the ball, he must move to the back of the line. If the batter hits a foul ball (generally, hits it behind him) or strikes swinging at the ball, he is retired as a batter, becomes a fielder, and moves to the end of the line. The fielder at the front of the line then becomes the batter. If the batter hits a line drive or pop-up to the fielders, whoever catches the ball, regardless of their position in the line, becomes the new batter; the batter moves to the end of the line.\nBanning.\nSome ballparks have banned pepper games because of the danger of balls landing in the stands and injuring spectators, as well as because its concentrated play damages the grass. Many ballparks display \"NO PEPPER (GAMES)\" warnings behind or near home plate."

He played for the Expos (1969) and Detroit Tigers (1970).\nRobertson started 27 of the 49 games he appeared in during his short MLB career. He pitched in the very first game in Montreal Expos history, contributing 1.1 innings of scoreless relief to an 11–10 victory over the New York Mets on April 8, 1969. He also had the best earned run average (ERA) (3.96) of any of the Expos pitchers who started 15 or more games during that inaugural season.\nAfter being used in relief during the early part of the season, Robertson joined the starting rotation on May 23. He pitched six or more innings in 17 of his 27 starts, but did not get much run support from his teammates. In his 16 losses, the Expos scored a \"total\" of just 20 runs, and were victims of a shutout in seven of those games. On September 13, 1969, Robertson picked up his one and only save at the MLB level. He pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings to nail down a 7-5 Expos victory over the Phillies. \nRobertson was traded by the Expos to the Detroit Tigers on December 3, 1969, for veteran right-handed pitcher Joe Sparma. In 1970, he appeared in 11 games for the Tigers, all in relief, with an ERA of 3.68. He also spent time with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens that year. On March 30, 1971, the Tigers traded him to the New York Mets, and he never again made it back to the big leagues.\nRobertson died in an automobile accident in 1996 in Burlington, Kansas."

It also included some of the conversations between the contestants between the shots. As such, it allowed the audience to feel they were part of a foursome traveling with the competitors and host, as opposed to being just a spectator in the gallery."

        "text": "In the final round of matches of the final round of Asian qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Japan and Iraq drew 2–2 in Doha, Qatar. If Japan had won the match, they would have qualified for the World Cup for the first time. Instead, Japan finished third in their group, allowing their arch-rivals South Korea to qualify instead. The Japanese refer to the match as the \"Agony of Doha\" (), whereas South Koreans, because the country's national football team only qualified in the final minutes of this match, refers to it as the \"Miracle of Doha\" ().\nThe failure to qualify for the World Cup, and the dramatic way in which it happened, caused great disappointment for Japanese fans. Football had become very popular in Japan with the launch of the professional J.League earlier that year and the team had never been that close to qualifying for the World Cup. Although Japan has since qualified for seven consecutive World Cup finals (even co-hosting one), team members from this match are still known as the and the phrase remains a rallying cry for fans.\nBefore the match.\nSix nations (Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea) competed in the final round of Asian qualification for two places at the 1994 World Cup in the United States. The six finalists played each other in Doha, Qatar in a round robin format of matches that were held between 15 and 28 October 1993. After four rounds of matches and with two points for a victory (instead of three) for each team, the standings were as follows:\nIn the 4th round of matches, Japan defeated South Korea 1–0 taking first place in the standings going into the final match. Although just one point separated the 1st and 5th spots and only North Korea had been eliminated, Japan would have qualified for the finals with a win regardless of any other results. Japan still would have qualified with a draw as long as either South Korea or Saudi Arabia failed to win its last match and Iran did not defeat Saudi Arabia by more than four goals.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match was held on 28 October 1993, simultaneously with the rest of the fifth round of matches, South Korea vs North Korea and Saudi Arabia vs Iran, held in other venues in Doha.\nJapan opened the scoring from a first-half goal by Kazuyoshi Miura, but Iraq's Ahmed Radhi scored the equaliser just prior to half-time. Japan again took the lead with a goal from Masashi Nakayama. The 2–1 score stood as the match approached the 90th minute.\nThe matches at the other venues had ended earlier, with South Korea beating North Korea 3–0 and Saudi Arabia beating Iran 4–3. This meant Japan would have to hold onto the score in order to qualify for the World Cup, with the combination of results eliminating South Korea.\nHowever, Japan gave the ball up to Iraq, and just after the match entered stoppage time, Jaffar Omran scored a goal through a corner kick, tying the score at 2–2. The referee blew the final whistle and finished the match moments after this, eliminating both teams.\nResults.\nAfter the final round of matches, the standings looked as follows:\nSaudi Arabia took first place with their 4–3 victory over Iran. Japan and South Korea were even on points, but South Korea held the goal difference advantage after the three-goal victory over North Korea, winning the tie-breaker.\nSouth Korea would tie in subsequent matches against Iraq (2–2) and Saudi Arabia (1–1) and lost a match against Japan (0–1). Had Japan won this match against Iraq, South Korea would have been eliminated even if they won the match against North Korea held on the same day. But as Japan and Iraq tied in the last minute, South Korea qualified and the match was dubbed a \"miracle\" by South Korean media.\nDutch coach Hans Ooft was sacked weeks after the match and the elimination effectively ended World Cup aspirations for the majority of the team, most notably Ruy Ramos and Miura, Japan's top scorer in the campaign. Only two Japanese players who appeared in the match, Nakayama and Masami Ihara, would go on to appear in Japan's 1998 FIFA World Cup squad.\nHowever, the Agony of Doha would serve as an inspiration for future World Cup qualification campaigns to this day.\nAftermath.\nAfter missing the 1994 edition, Japan eventually qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, before hosting the 2002 FIFA World Cup along with their rival South Korea. The South Koreans dramatically beat Portugal, Italy, and Spain and ended in 4th place while Japan was eliminated in the Round of 16. Both teams lost to Turkey. It was the first time for both teams to reach the knockout phase.\nThey also qualified for every single FIFA World Cup edition since then, reaching the Round of 16 in three editions: in 2010, 2018 and 2022. However, in each of these occasions, Japan got eliminated in dramatic fashion. They first lost to Paraguay in 2010 in a penalty shoot-out, and then lost to Belgium in 2018 by 3-2 after conceding in the fourth minute of stoppage time after a Belgian counter-attack following a Japanese corner kick; the Japanese were leading 2–0 until the 69th minute. In 2022, Japan got knocked out again in the Round of 16, this time taking the lead against Croatia but falling in another penalty shoot-out that ensued after a 1–1 draw.\nFor Iraq, this failure is just one part of the much larger World Cup drought. In comparison to increasing success of the Japanese side, Iraq has repeatedly missed the opportunity to qualify for every World Cup. Iraq has only qualified for the 1986 edition. In addition, sectarian conflicts and internal turmoil have prevented Iraq from achieving a greater status in Asian football. Since this game as well, Iraq has not beaten Japan in a competitive match until 2024, when Iraq beat Japan 2-1 at the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. Iraq also suffered a losing streak to Japan since this game, starting with a 1–4 defeat at the 2000 AFC Asian Cup (which was Japan's first win over Iraq), until 2017 when Iraq drew Japan 1–1 to end the country's losing streak.\nJapan in neutral site qualifiers.\nBeginning with qualifiers for the 1998 World Cup, AFC has used home-and-away round robin format for its final qualifying round, instead of the single-venue format used in 1993. However, in two of the subsequent World Cup qualifying campaigns, Japan have determined its World Cup fate in neutral site matches.\nIn 1997, Japan and Iran finished second in their respective qualifying groups for the 1998 World Cup and met in the third-place match on 16 November 1997 in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The match would decide the third and last automatic qualifying spot for Asian teams and the loser would face Oceania's representative Australia in a two-legged play-off. Unlike the match four years before, Japan fell behind in the second half, but scored a late equaliser and eventually won 3–2 through a golden goal in extra time, earning the nation its ticket to France. This match was known as the in reference to the Agony of Doha.\nOn 8 June 2005, Japan defeated North Korea 2–0 to qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Although this match was scheduled as a home match for North Korea, it was moved to Bangkok, Thailand and held behind closed doors as punishment for crowd violence in a previous match held in Pyongyang."

        "text": "Jesus Green Swimming Pool is a lido situated on Jesus Green in Cambridge, England. Opened in 1923, it is one of the few remaining examples of the lidos built across the country in the 1920s — open air pools with space for activities other than swimming. Unusually, the pool is significantly longer than it is wide — this was a design idea to mimic swimming in the nearby river. It opens for public bathing every day from May to September each year, and remains open but operates reduced hours over the winter period.\nJesus Green, though only wide, is among the longest outdoor swimming pools in Europe at in length (the largest freshwater lido is Tooting Bec Lido in London, which is the same length, but wide).\nIt has a depth of at each end, and a maximum depth of in the centre. Diving is allowed into the centre section of the pool. The pool has a dedicated swimming lane for 'fast' swimmers the remaining two-thirds is for recreational swimming.\nThe pool is unheated. The Friends of Jesus Green Pool maintain data on water temperatures on their website.\nLocated alongside the River Cam opposite Chesterton Road between Jesus Lock and Victoria Avenue Bridge, the pool has sunbathing space and is paved on one side with grass on the other. A sauna is available.\nA map giving the detailed layout of the lido can be seen on OpenStreetMap.\nDespite past attempts to shut it down, it has remained open. In 1997, the pool facilities were upgraded, with new shower and toilet facilities added, although the new design was complained about, due to problems with the architecture and plumbing. The pool still retains most of its original features and remains of interest from a historical point of view. There are separate male and female changing facilities, and domed structures containing showers at either end. Baskets, and room for their storage, are provided for clothes.\nThere is a much smaller outdoor pool upstream of the city centre at Sheep's Green, and swimming in the Cam remains popular near Grantchester.\nIn Media.\nA short film titled \"Jesus Green Pool\" was produced in 2004 by amateur director Chris Cox. The film emphasizes the seasonal nature of the pool by documenting a single summer at the pool; from opening in the Spring, to closing in the Autumn. It was shown at the Cambridge Film Festival in the summer of 2005."

        "text": "Hotbox is a baseball drill or mini-game that can be played with three or more players and two to four bases. In the drill, one fielder plays near each of the bases and the rest of the players are runners, who begin on any base. The fielders proceed to throw the ball to each other, playing catch. At any time, a runner may attempt to run to the next or previous base. The fielders then attempt to throw to each other and tag that runner out. If a runner is tagged out (either once or three times), he then becomes a fielder, and the fielder who tagged him out becomes a runner. Runners count how many bases they reach safely, and the player with the most bases when the group decides to quit, wins. If there are three or more bases, the runners may run in either direction. \nOften, runners will get into a rundown or \"hotbox,\" for which the drill is named; the fielders must use teamwork and skill to put the runners out. Errors often happen as well, with which the fielders must contend as the runners scramble to earn additional bases.\nFielders must take care not to hit the runners with a thrown ball. Some players may choose to devise a penalty for hitting a runner with a ball, such as a deduction in the fielder's own score. Batter's helmets are recommended. If it is too difficult for runners to advance safely, the bases can be spaced closer together to shift the balance; conversely, bases farther apart give the fielders an advantage (assuming they can throw well)."

        "text": "Russell Charles Meyer (October 25, 1923 – November 16, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. A right-handed pitcher, Meyer's professional career lasted for 16 seasons, including 319 games pitched over all or part of 13 years in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs (1946–48; 1956), Philadelphia Phillies (1949–52), Brooklyn Dodgers (1953–55), Cincinnati Redlegs (1956), Boston Red Sox (1957) and Kansas City Athletics (1959). The native of Peru, Illinois, was listed as tall and . His hot temper earned him the nickname \"Mad Monk\".\nInitially signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent in 1942, Meyer spent 1943 performing United States Army service during World War II. While pitching for his camp team, Meyer was stricken with appendicitis, then contracted peritonitis; he was given a medical discharge and released by the White Sox organization. He signed with the crosstown Cubs, spent three seasons in the Class A1 (now Double-A) Southern Association, and made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 13, 1946.\nAmong Meyer's ten full big-league seasons, two stand out. In , as a Phillie, he won 17 of 25 decisions with a 3.08 earned run average (seventh in the National League), as Philadelphia finished in the first division for only the second time since World War I. Then, in his maiden campaign for the Dodgers in , he went 15–5, for a sparkling .750 winning percentage. However, his ERA was a poor 4.56 and he surrendered 25 home runs in 191 innings pitched—testimony to the Dodgers' potent offense and the intimate dimensions of Ebbets Field, where Meyer's earned run average was 5.28. That season, Brooklyn won 105 games and its second consecutive National League pennant.\nOverall, Meyer posted a career MLB win–loss record of 94–73 (.563) with an ERA of 3.99 in his 319-game career, which included 219 starting pitcher assignments. He allowed 1,606 hits and 543 bases on balls in 1,531 innings pitched, striking out 672. He registered 65 complete games and 13 shutouts, and five saves. He worked in three World Series (1950, 1953 and 1955), all against the New York Yankees. In four relief appearances, he went 0–1 (3.09), allowing four earned runs in 11 innings of work. He was a member of Brooklyn's 1955 World Championship squad.\nSeveral years after his active career ended, he became a minor league pitching coach in the Yankees' organization, and served one season () on the MLB staff of Yankees' manager Buck Showalter. On May 6, 1961, Meyer served as a television color commentator alongside Bob Finnegan for a game between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox on CBS. He died in 1997 at age 74.\nMeyer was the first of three pitchers in major league history to have at least 23 consecutive road starts without a loss: Allie Reynolds has the record with 25, spanning the 1948 and 1949 seasons, a feat Kansas City Royals pitcher Chris Young nearly matched. Meyer had 24 consecutive road starts without a loss during the 1953 and 1954 seasons."

        "title": "Chris Porter (basketball)",
        "text": "Christopher Bernard Porter (born May 9, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player. Known for his large afro hairstyle and giant vertical leap, he created excitement early in his career with his dunking and rebounding abilities. Largely seen as too undersized to play power forward at the NBA level, his style fit in perfectly with coach Cliff Ellis' style of full court pressure while playing at Auburn.\nEarly life.\nPorter was born and raised in Abbeville, Alabama, a small town with \"just three streetlights\" and a few thousand people. He attended Abbeville High where he helped the school win the 4A State Championship as a senior. He subsequently earned 4A State Player of the Year honors.\nCollege career.\nBetween 1996 and 1998, Porter played college basketball for Chipola College where he earned JUCO All-American honors. He then played two years for Auburn University, helping them reach the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in 1998–99, Porter's junior season. He was named SEC Player of the Year that season and was selected to the All-America team. The following year, Porter was pictured on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" as the Auburn Tigers were picked to win the national title. However, true to the Sports Illustrated cover jinx, the Tigers struggled and Porter was suspended for the last eight games of the season for accepting money from an agent while still in college. Porter reportedly accepted $2,500 to save his mother from being evicted from her home and claimed he did not know the person was affiliated with any sports agency.\nProfessional career.\nNBA.\nPorter was selected with the 55th overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. As a rookie in 2000–01, he averaged 8.6 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 51 games. His season was hindered, however, by a nagging sprained left ankle. Despite a solid rookie season, the 2001 off-season proved to be Porter's downfall from the NBA. After showing up three days late to the Warriors' summer camp, followed by an off-the-court arrest, Porter was traded to the Charlotte Hornets in a three-team, eight-player deal on October 25, 2001, just days prior to the start of the 2001–02 season. However, Porter missed his flight the next morning from Oakland, California, which the Hornets said was enough reason to waive him on the spot. With pending drug charges against him from an August arrest in Alabama in which police stopped him and found cocaine, marijuana and a handgun in his car, the Hornets refused to give Porter any leeway. Porter would never play in the NBA after the 2000 - 2001 season with his final game being on April 18, 2001 in a 81 - 95 loss to the Vancouver Grizzlies. In his final game, Porter recorded a double-double (14 points and 11 rebounds) as the Warriors starting Small Forward.\nCBA, USBL, Italy and Portugal.\nIn January 2002, Porter signed with the Dakota Wizards of the Continental Basketball Association. In 24 games for Dakota in 2001–02, he averaged 16.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.7 steals per game, helping the team win the 2002 CBA championship. Following the CBA season, he had a six-game stint with the Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League, helping the team win the 2002 USBL championship.\nIn August 2002, Porter signed with Carifac Fabriano of the Lega Basket Serie A. His stint with the Italian club lasted just 10 games, averaging 12.9 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. In January 2003, he re-joined the Dakota Wizards. Later that year, he had stint in Puerto Rico with Gigantes de Carolina and again played for the Oklahoma Storm.\nFor the 2003–04 season, Porter moved to Portugal where he played for Oliveirense Simoldes. His stint lasted until January 2004 when he was released by the club. He went on to play for both the Dakota Wizards and Oklahoma Storm once again during 2004. In 2004–05, he split the season playing for the Dakota Wizards and Korean team Daegu Orions.\nChina and Philippines.\nFor the 2005–06 season, Porter moved to China where he joined Fujian Xunxing. He played 10 games for Fujian before departing the club in December 2005 and joining the Barangay Ginebra Kings of the Philippine Basketball Association. He led the team through to the semi-finals of the 2006 PBA Playoffs before they lost their series 4–3 to rival and eventual champion, the Red Bull Barako.\nPorter returned to China for the 2006–07 season, re-joining Fujian Xunxing. In 29 games for the club in 2006–07, he averaged 22 points and 13 rebounds per game. In January 2007, he played for the CBA All-Stars in a two-game exhibition series against the Korean Basketball League All-Stars. Porter scored 17 points in Game 1, and 13 points in Game 2, with the CBA losing both games. He again played for Fujian in 2007–08, but he managed just 15 games before departing the club in December 2007. He returned to Fujian in 2008, playing for the club until December 2010 when he was released half-way through the 2010–11 season due to an injury.\nIn June 2011, Porter joined the Powerade Tigers for the 2011 PBA Governors' Cup.\nNBA D-League.\nAfter a stint in the ABA for the Las Vegas Aces in 2011–12, Porter began a successful three-year run with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League between December 2012 and April 2015, winning a championship with the team in 2013–14. In 126 regular season games for the Mad Ants over three seasons, Porter averaged 6.1 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 17.8 minutes per game.\nIn June 2014, Porter had a one-game stint with the Texas Lone Star Strikers of the International Basketball League.\nNew Zealand.\nOn January 19, 2016, Porter signed with the Hawke's Bay Hawks for the 2016 New Zealand NBL season. Named co-captain of the team alongside Aidan Daly, he made his debut for the Hawks in the team's season opener on March 13. In 26 minutes of action as a starter, he recorded a team-high 21 points and 6 rebounds in an 89–74 loss to the Wellington Saints. On March 24, he recorded a double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds against the Southland Sharks. Four days later, he recorded a second consecutive double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds against the Canterbury Rams. After going 0–4 over their first four games, things got worse for the Hawks on April 3 with Porter being ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury. In those four games, Porter averaged 18.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 1.5 steals per game.\nOther media.\nPorter has appeared as a playable character in the video games \"ESPN NBA 2Night\", \"NBA 2K1\", \"NBA Hoopz\", \"NBA Live 2001\" (\"PS2\" &amp; \"PC\" versions), \"NBA Live 2002\", \"NBA ShootOut 2001\" (\"PS1\" version only) and \"NBA ShootOut 2002\".\nDrug arrests.\nPorter has been arrested numerous times due to drug possession. The first time was in August 2001 when Alabama police found small plastic bags of cocaine and marijuana in the car he was driving. In April 2006, Alabama police charged him with driving under the influence and second-degree possession of marijuana. In November 2010, he pleaded guilty in Houston County Circuit Court to a misdemeanor marijuana charge.\nIn January 2021, Porter was arrested by the Dothan Police Department for 1st degree sexual abuse. Arrest record show the charge stems from an allegation that he fondled a female teenager (18 years of age)."

        "text": "The 1992 Little League World Series took place between August 24 and August 29 in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The team representing the Zamboanga City Little League, the Filipino representative in the Far East Region, won the International Championship while Long Beach, California, the United States West Region representative, won the U.S. Championship.\nIn the championship game, Zamboanga City defeated Long Beach 15–4 to become the first Asian team outside of Taiwan, South Korea, or Japan to be champion. However, upon further review it was discovered that the Filipino team violated age and residency rules and Little League stripped them of their title. Long Beach was awarded a 6–0 victory by forfeit as per Little League rules and became only the fourth American team in twenty years to be Little League World Champions.\nThe championship game did not feature a team from Taiwan for the first time since 1985. This tied the record of six consecutive finals set by Taiwan from 1977 through 1982. To date, this record has not been seriously approached by one country or state.\nFar East series.\nBetween 1967, when Japan's West Tokyo won, and 1992, the Little League World Series was won 19 of a possible 25 times by the Far East champion. Competing against the national champions of traditionally stronger baseball nations like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, Filipino teams had been unable to qualify for the LLWS. In 1992, however, the Far East was represented by Zamboanga City, which had won the national Filipino title.\nThe tournament.\nThe 1992 tournament debuted the round-robin format; no longer would a team play against a predetermined opponent in the first round, with the winners facing each other in the semifinal, with the winner advancing to the Saturday championship.\nThe new format had each team play the other three teams in their bracket, and then having the top two teams play each other in the semifinal, with the winners advancing to the championship.\nZamboanga City defeated the teams from Germany and Quebec before losing to the Dominican Republic, in the round-robin. This was enough to get them into the international final, a rematch with the Dominican Republic, which they won 5–1. The championship game against California was a blowout, with Zamboanga City winning 15–4 after a seven-run first inning. The team was hailed as heroes in the Philippines, President Ramos giving the team a gift of 1,000,000 pesos to contribute to the livelihood of their families. Long Beach head coach Jeff Burroughs remarked that semi-final pitcher \"Roberto Placious\" had the poise of a high school or college pitcher.\nZamboanga City Little League.\nInitial investigation.\nThere had been some suspicions about the Zamboanga City team soon after it arrived in Williamsport. Several committee members did not think that the manager and coach seemed \"typical.\" However, nothing more came of it after assurances were given that the manager and coach were from the same league as the players and had coached in that league during the regular season. A few days after Zamboanga City's triumphant victory, however, journalist Al Mendoza of the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" began publishing stories suggesting that some players were ineligible. He had received letters from several neighbors and relatives claiming that several players were too old for Little League. Local administrator Armando Andaya was faxed four questions from Little League president Creighton Hale, regarding player ages, birth certificates, residence, and a specific question regarding winning championship game pitcher Ian Tolentino's participation in a tournament in 1990 (possibly with the view of suggesting this would have made him over the age limit). Andaya admitted to violating rules on district representation—eight players were from outside the Zamboanga City area, some as far away as Luzon, and unable to speak Chabacano, the language most commonly spoken in Zamboanga. Andaya claimed that the eight players replaced, for various reasons, were unable to go to China for the Far East series and that the out-of-district substitutes were only used to make up numbers rather than to give the team an extra edge over their opponents. He also admitted that the team's original coach had been replaced with someone from Manila.\nDisqualification.\nLittle League Baseball stripped Zamboanga City of its title. Under Little League rules at the time, when a team was found to have used an ineligible player, it forfeited only its most recent game (otherwise they would have to put the entire tournament on hold while the teams that lost to the illegal team were put back into the tournament). Since the revelation was made after the championship game, that game was declared a 6–0 forfeit victory for Long Beach, which was awarded the championship. The exposed players and parents remained defiant, and accused Little League Baseball of denying them due process.\nMore revelations.\nWith many Filipinos outraged at what they saw as an unpatriotic betrayal by Mendoza, who was given the key to the city of Long Beach, fellow Inquirer journalist Armand N. Nocum conducted further investigation \nand found that even the six true Zamboangueños were over-age, including at least two as old as 15, and thus ineligible. It was discovered that, as with the eight non-district players, the fraud had been maintained by the players' assumption of identities of (eligible) players who had represented the city at the national championships, the families of whom were reportedly willing to reveal all, jealous of the prizes bestowed upon the players who had used their sons' identities to represent their country at the Far East and World Series. In some cases, even the parents of the ineligible players assumed appropriate identities to maintain the appearance of propriety. Nocum, a native of the area, had not wanted to believe such an egregious fraud was taking place, but discovered that even school officials were in on the cover-up. Later, Nocum, seemingly backing Andaya's assertion that the substitutes were not chosen to artificially inflate the team's performance, told \"Sports Illustrated\" that had the original Zamboanga City team participated in the World Series, they would have trounced Long Beach by at least 30–4.\nIn an interesting postscript, Zamboanga City was disqualified from the Filipino national titles the very next year in another over-age player scandal.\nChampions Path.\nThe Long Beach LL had an undefeated record of 12 wins and 0 losses to reach the LLWS. In total their record was 17–0, the last win coming from the forfeit by the Philippines."

        "title": "Battlefield Baseball",
        "text": " is a 2003 Japanese film directed by Yūdai Yamaguchi. The film is written by Gatarō Man, based on his manga series of the same name, and stars Tak Sakaguchi, Atsushi Itō, and Hideo Sakaki. It was produced by Ryuhei Kitamura.\nThe film is a combination of several genres, mixing martial arts action with the clichés of the sports film—particularly skewering baseball, one of Japan's most popular high school sports—and the violence and brutality of a horror film. The film's bizarre—sometimes almost incoherent—plot, blood and gore, and unique comedy have given it something of a \"cult\" popularity in the Western world.\nThough the film is ostensibly about high school baseball rivalries, the amount of actual baseball in the film is fairly light. There are many scenes involving bats and balls, however.\nThe film was released on Region 1 DVD by Subversive Cinema.\nPlot.\nEvery high school baseball team's dream is to go to the legendary Koshien Stadium Tournament. For the first time in years, Seido High School has a chance- star player Gorilla Matsui has finally given the team an opportunity to succeed. Most delighted at this prospect is Principal Kocho. However, the Head teacher reveals to him that the first game will be played against the Gedo High School, infamous for brutally killing all their opponents. Kocho instantly loses all hope, both for his students' lives and winning the tournament.\nSeido's bumbling catcher Megane, or \"Four Eyes,\" named such for his glasses, is fetching a wayward ball and ends up cornered by a gang of expelled students. Newly transferred student Jubeh appears on the scene and defends Four Eyes from the gang. Kocho witnesses as Jubeh engages the dropouts leader Bancho (Japanese for \"boss\" or \"leader\") in a round of \"fighting baseball\" and prevails. Impressed, Kocho begs for Jubeh to join the baseball team, but Jubeh refuses as he took a vow. However, Bancho reappears and joins the team, thanks to Jubeh's punches curing the injuries that prevented him from playing.\nWhen confronted by Four Eyes, Jubeh musically laments his pitching skill, explaining how he became so skilled he was a danger to himself and others. Jubeh accidentally killed his father with a baseball pitch to the head, causing him to vow not to play baseball again. Four Eyes says he loves the sport as he keeps playing despite his lack of talent and hiding from his baseball-hating mother and insists Jubeh has this love. Touched, Jubeh joins the team.\nHowever, when the game against Gedo starts, Jubeh is nowhere to be found, and Four Eyes wanders off to find him. Jubeh arrives only to find Seido already slaughtered, and an exploding decoy kills him. In the afterlife, Jubeh finds his father, who tells him to embrace his skills and defeat Gedo for the good of everyone. Inspired, Jubeh returns from the grave, as does Bancho, who also met Jubeh's father in the afterlife and was given the mitt that can stop Jubeh's pitch.\nFour Eyes' mother finds out he plays baseball and locks him in a cage. Jubeh comes to the rescue and fights her, and as he gains the upper hand, he asks why she hates baseball. As she tells that her father died to a baseball and Four Eyes' brother disappeared, Jubeh realizes the two are his family. In jubilation, their mother gives Four Eyes permission to play. Jubeh, Four Eyes, Bancho and Kocho form a new Seido team. Head Teacher and Gorilla, now cyborgs, one of the school's cheerleaders, and Four Eyes' mother also team up to defeat Gedo.\nUltimately, all except Jubeh and the Gedo coach have been knocked unconscious. After a duel, Jubeh is knocked down, and the coach prepares to stab him with a poison-injecting baseball bat. Four Eyes sacrifices himself to intercept the coach's attack. Jubeh, furious at the loss of his brother, leaps up and bitterly attacks the coach. However, before he can kill the coach, the Gedo players plead for his life, explaining how he brought them out of orphanages and became like a father to them. Jubeh allows the coach to live.\nA crowd gathers as the coach gains a newfound respect for life and gives Jubeh the antidote for the poison. However, one of the Gedo players emerges and guns down everyone on the field except Jubeh. Looking around in outrage, Jubeh sheds a tear. As cherry blossoms fall, everyone on the field returns to life before Jubeh attacks the bandaged gunman, literally knocking the muscles off his bones.\nJoyously, the crowd celebrates, and the narrator (who turned out to be the bleacher's drunkard's dog) states that they lived happily ever- including the one person on the field that day not resurrected by Jubeh's tears.\nReception.\nThe reaction to the film has been for the most part lukewarm. Though many praised its irreverent and unique style, others found the purposefully ludicrous plot hard to follow and indicative of a lack of effort on the screenwriter's part. However, the film did win the Grand Prize at the 14th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival held in February 2003. Director Yūdai Yamaguchi was a guest at the festival.\nThe film has been compared with other Japanese films featuring baseball prominently. For instance, one reviewer compared it to 1992's \"Mr. Baseball\", explaining that it was better than that film due to a relative lack of actual baseball. The parodic aspect of the film takes so much precedence that the clichés of baseball films are skewered more than baseball itself.\nOne of the key aspects of the film is its intentional strangeness. The strangest aspects of the plot (the frequent reappearances of a crowd and an alcoholic man, Head Teacher and Gorilla returning as cyborgs, etc.) are more prominent than the plot in the minds of most reviewers.\nMost reviewers agree that while the film is not necessarily high art, it is a good martial arts/horror/comedy film—they say that it is interesting and exciting enough to keep one watching until the end credits. The film's humour is often highly praised, lightening up what would otherwise be a superficial and generic action film. The film has received some criticism, largely that it is ludicrous and \"stupid\", or that its plot does not sustain its length. However, others argue that this is not only irrelevant—The film is \"intended\" to be ludicrous and stupid—it is actually one of the strengths of the film."

        "title": "Rugby union in France",
        "text": "Rugby union in France is a popular team sport. Rugby union was first introduced in the early 1870s by British residents, which makes the country one of the few early exponents of the sport. Elite French clubs participate in the professional domestic club league, the Top 14. Clubs also compete in the European knock-out competition, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which replaced the Heineken Cup from 2014 to 2015.\nThe national side competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, last winning the competition in 2022. France has participated in every Rugby World Cup since its inception in 1987, and has been a runner-up on three occasions. France also hosted the 2007 Rugby World Cup and hosted it again in 2023.\nFrance, with 65 million people, is the world's most populous country in which rugby union has a large and dedicated following. That is more than the populations of other popular rugby nations such as New Zealand, Australia, Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales combined.\nGoverning body.\nFédération Française de Rugby (FFR) is the rugby union governing body in France; they are responsible for the governing of rugby union in France, including the France national team and the organisers of the country's professional competitions, Ligue Nationale de Rugby. It was formed in 1919.\nIn 1934 the FFR set up the Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur (FIRA) in an attempt to organize rugby union outside the authority of the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). It included the national teams of , France, , , and .\nIn 1978, the FFR became a member of the IRFB, known from 1998 to 2014 as the International Rugby Board (IRB) and since November 2014 as World Rugby. In 1995, the same year that rugby union became a fully professional sport, FIRA officially recognised the IRFB as the worldwide governing authority for the sport and turned itself into an exclusively European governing body. FIRA adopted its current name of Rugby Europe in 2014.\nHistory.\nRugby football was introduced into France by the British in the early 1870s.\nIt was in 1872 that a group of British residents formed the Le Havre Athletique, which played a hybrid form of football, a cross between rugby football and association football, called \"combination\".\nThe English Taylors RFC, which was formed by British businessmen in Paris in 1877, was followed by Paris Football Club a year later. Racing Club de France was formed in 1882 and their rivals Stade Français in 1883. On 20 March 1892 the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques organised the first ever French rugby union championship, a one-off game between Racing and Stade Français. The game was refereed by Pierre de Coubertin and saw Racing win 4–3. The USFSA remained the main controlling body of French rugby, until the formation of the French Rugby Federation (FFR, from the ) in 1920.\nIn 1900, rugby was played at the Paris Summer Olympics. France entered a team, along with Germany and Great Britain. France won the gold medal, the first ever rugby event at the Olympics. In 1905, for the first time, England and France played each other. In 1910, France coined the term The Five Nations, though they had competed in the home nations tournament four times previously, the tournament would be known as the Five Nations for most of the rest of the 20th century.\nRugby was again played at the 1920 Summer Olympics, though this time, in what is considered one of the most surprising results in rugby history, France fumbled in the gold medal match, being defeated at the hands of the United States, eight points to nil. That same year, the FFR was officially formed. France again participated in rugby at the 1924 Summer Olympics – the last time 15-player rugby would be played as an Olympic sport – where the United States successfully defended their title.\nThe French rugby union was ousted from the Five Nations championship on charges of player violence and professionalism in 1932. In 1934, Rugby league was introduced to France, half a century after the amateur code had established itself in the country. Also in 1934, FIRA (Federation of Amateur Rugby) was founded by Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Catalonia (Spain), and Sweden. During the second World War, the French Rugby Union actively collaborated with the Vichy Regime to have Rugby League banned. In so doing, the Rugby Union were handed all of the vast assets built up by the French Rugby League since 1934. As of 2023, these assets have not been returned to the Rugby League. In 1939, France was re-invited to participate in the following year's Home Nations tournament, but the onset of the Second World War put all international rugby on hold. The first post-war Five Nations championship took place in 1947, and was the first top-level rugby tournament France had played in since 1931.\nIn 1978, the FFR joined what is now known as World Rugby. Also in 1959, the national team won the Five Nations for the first time, and subsequently won another consecutive three championships (1960 was shared with England). This success was repeated at the end of the 1960s, when France won both the 1967 and 1968 championships, the 1968 being a Grand Slam. France has nearly always been in the top three teams of the Northern Hemisphere since then.\nThe first Rugby World Cup was held in 1987. After a low period in the mid-1990s caused by FFR's hesitation to join in the introduction of professional rugby in 1995, the national team has regained its top-tier status. In 1998, France's women's team competed at the first official Women's Rugby World Cup which was held in the Netherlands. In 2003, France was awarded the right to host the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and the country also hosted the 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup.\nPopularity.\nRugby union is more popular in the South of France, whilst in the North of the country, association football can be viewed as the leading code. There are 1,737 clubs in France and the number of licensed players has significantly increased over the recent years, reaching 390,000 in 2010 (up from 260,000 in 2000).\nIn 2010, the all-French final of the Heineken Cup between Toulouse and Biarritz in the Stade de France received 3.2 million viewers on France 2. In 2011, the final of the Top 14 gathered 4.4 million viewers on France 2 and Canal+ and the World Cup final between New Zealand and France gathered 15.4 million viewers on TF1, the highest audience on French TV since the start of the year.\nCompetitions.\nNational.\nThe major national club competition in France is the Top 14 (formerly, the Top 16). The Top 14 is played on a home and away basis between the top fourteen club sides in France, followed by three rounds of playoffs involving the top six teams on the league table. The first championship was contested in 1892 and won by the Racing Club, predecessor to today's Racing 92. The current champions are ASM Clermont Auvergne. The second major competition in France is Rugby Pro D2, featuring 16 teams that also play a home-and-away regular season.\nA relegation system exists between the two tiers of competition. At the end of the 2017–18 season, Perpignan was promoted to the Top 14 as promotion play-off champions of Pro D2, while losing finalists Grenoble won a second play-off against the 13th placed Top 14 side Oyonnax to join them. At the bottom of the Top 14 table, Brive and play-off losers Oyonnax were relegated to Pro D2.\nPromotion and relegation also exist between Pro D2 and Fédérale 1, the top level of the French amateur rugby system. At the end of the 2018–19 season, Massy and Bourg-en-Bresse were relegated; they were replaced by Rouen who won the 2018–19 Fédérale 1 title and were thereby automatically promoted and Valence Romans, which won the Fédérale 1 promotion playoffs. Fédérale 1, which involves 41 clubs, is the top level of an extensive system of Fédérale leagues that includes nearly 300 clubs in all.\nAs the map below shows the vast majority of Top 14 and D2 clubs are located in the southern half of France. For 2019–20, the only exceptions to this are:\nLong-term plans call for LNR to establish a third professional league below Pro D2 starting with the 2020–21 season. The build-up to the establishment of this league will see a major LNR initiative to encourage the development of professional clubs in the country's north. To this end, one of the two annual promotion places from Fédérale 1 to Pro D2 will be reserved for a northern club (defined as north of a line running roughly from La Rochelle to Lyon) starting with the 2017–18 season and ending in 2019–20. Each chosen club will receive €800,000 from LNR to assist them in the transition to professional rugby.\nEuropean.\nThe European Rugby Champions Cup is Europe's current top-level club competition, an annual affair involving leading club, regional and provincial teams from the Six Nations: England, France, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Italy. It replaced the previous top-tier competition, the Heineken Cup (known in France as the H Cup due to alcohol advertising laws), effective in 2014–15. The Champions Cup was originally envisioned as a breakaway competition by English and French club teams, but eventually the other four nations joined in the new structure, and the Champions Cup instead became the replacement for the Heineken Cup.\nThe Heineken Cup was launched during the European summer of 1995 by the (then) Five Nations Committee, following the advent of professional rugby union. The tournament was born with the intention of providing a new level of professional European competition. The French clubs have been quite successful in the tournament under both of its identities. The inaugural competition was won by Toulouse, with Brive victorious the next year. Toulouse became the first team to win the competition more than twice, becoming champions again in 2003, 2005, and 2010. Toulon were champions in the final two editions of the Heineken Cup in 2013 and 2014, and the first edition of the Champions Cup in 2015, making them the first team ever to win three consecutive European championships.\nThe second-tier European Rugby Challenge Cup also launched in 2014–15 as the replacement for the European Challenge Cup. The original Challenge Cup began the year after the Heineken Cup. Currently, all Top 14 teams that do not qualify for the Champions Cup compete in the Challenge Cup. The first four editions of the original Challenge Cup were all won by French sides—Bourgoin in 1997, Colomiers in 1998, Clermont (then known as Montferrand) in 1999, and Pau in 2000. Since then, French sides have made the finals 11 more times, with Clermont winning in 2007, Biarritz defeating Toulon in an all-French final in 2012, Montpellier winning in 2016, and Stade Français victorious in 2017.\nThe European Shield, which ran from 2002–03 to 2004–05, was a repechage competition that involved first-round losers in the original Challenge Cup. It was scrapped when the European Challenge Cup was revamped for the 2005–06 season. This trophy was claimed by a French club in each of its three seasons—Castres in 2003, Montpellier in 2004, and Auch in 2005.\nNational side.\nFrance, nicknamed \"Les Bleus\" (The Blues), is a top tier nation, as cited by World Rugby. The French style of play, nicknamed the \"French flair,\" is renowned for its paradoxical combination of rugged physicality and inspired grace.\nFrance compete in the Six Nations Championship annually.\nAlthough France have never won the Rugby World Cup, they have appeared in the final match in 1987, 1999 and 2011 Rugby World Cup – losing twice to New Zealand, in 1987 and 2011, and once to Australia, in 1999. France have appeared in the semi-finals at every tournament except for 1991, 2015, 2019 and 2023 where they were knocked out in the quarter-final stage.\nNational Rugby Centre (CNR).\nThe National Rugby Centre (in French, \"Centre National du Rugby\" or CNR) was opened by then French president Jacques Chirac in November 2002. The facility cost GP£46 million (approx. €68 million, c.2007), and is located in the village of Marcoussis, south of Paris.\nThe facility covers and includes five rugby pitches (one of them covered, and two floodlit), a gym, medical facilities, a swimming pool, media centre, and library. Living quarters are also included, with 30 rooms which are each named after a championship winning French club. The living quarters also have a dedicated restaurant. France's under-19 team are permanently based at CNR, and provide regular opposition for the France national team during training.\nCNR Marcoussis was the venue for the 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup pool stages and for the lesser matches in the knockout stage.\nMedia coverage.\nFree-to-air channel France 2 broadcasts the Six Nations games, as well as France's home internationals, such as those that are played during the latter stages of the year in November.\nMatches from the Top 14 are broadcast by the premium pay television channel Canal+, which also broadcasts many other rugby union competitions, including the Southern Hemisphere's Rugby Championship, between Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\nMatches from the Pro D2 are broadcast by Sport+, Eurosport and France 3 for local derbies"

        "text": "Dorf's Golf Bible is a 1988 comedy short film starring Tim Conway, Eddie Deezen and Michele Smith along with a special appearance by Sam Snead.\nCharacters.\nDerk Dorf is the main character and the voice-over. He is playing a game of golf when, apparently, a voice over commands what he does. For example, the voice over said for Dorf to keep his left elbow in, and he did and sliced it just as the voice-over said. Apparently Dorf re-enacts whatever the Golf bible commandments are.\nWaldo is Dorf's caddy. He first arrives late and does not know the terms of Golf. He also can distract or annoy Dorf whenever he is trying to golf. For example, Dorf asks for a tee, Waldo gives him a cup of hot tea. He replaces Leonard, who filled an identical role in \"Dorf on Golf\".\nBoom Boom is the beautiful, curvaceous blonde Angel of numbers. She gives out the commandments as the voice-over calls them out. She puts Roman numerals on a stone that has been flattened for her to put them on.\nSam Snead plays himself. The Golf Legend, Referred to as \"Slammin' Sam\", gives Dorf lessons on his swing, his grip, and other elements of his game. However, when Dorf performs these to disastrous results, he laughs heartily at Dorf's Failure. An oft-quoted line in the video is Sam's \"Why don't you quit?\", which is repeated by Sam on the Driving Range, and by Dorf's Dog in his backyard.\nProps.\nTarget - Dorf used a target to pretend that he was in the U.S. Open Golf Tournament. Apparently, he broke his neighbor's window by hitting the ball over the fence.\nSandwich - Dorf asked for a Sand Wedge, apparently he got a sandwich to hit the ball out of the sand.\nMotorized Putter - Dorf used a motorized putter to putt the ball to the hole. Apparently, it backfired on \"him\".\nPuns and Jokes.\nInjuries There have been many bad things that have happened to him. One is the ball hitting his head. When he stole somebody's 9-iron he hit it to a tree and it hit him back in the head with the same sound effect. Another joke was when he was hit by the brick when he was hitting the target pretending to be in the U.S. Open.\nDorf's wife - Dorf's wife is constantly bothered that Dorf is spending too much time playing Golf and not spending time with her. Dorf usually calls her a name such as \"My honey bucket, my sweetie pie, my darlin' lump of loveliness.\" Apparently when she's not listening, Dorf will talk behind her back."

        "text": "Joaquín Arias (born 21 September 1984) is a Dominican former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, New York Mets, and San Francisco Giants.\nEarly life.\nArias was born on 21 September 1984, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nArias signed with the New York Yankees as an international free agent in 2001. He batted .266 for the Battle Creek Yankees of the Class A Midwest League in 2003.\nThe Texas Rangers acquired Arias on 23 March 2004, completing a trade made 36 days earlier on 16 February that sent Alex Rodriguez to the New York Yankees for Alfonso Soriano. Among five Yankees prospects offered to the Rangers, Arias was selected over Robinson Canó because he was a more polished defender and two years younger.\nTexas Rangers (2006, 2008–2010).\nArias made his Major League debut with the Rangers on 13 September 2006, drawing a walk against the Detroit Tigers.\nNew York Mets (2010).\nArias was designated for assignment on 24 August 2010 and traded to the New York Mets on 31 August for Jeff Francoeur.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn 4 November 2010, Arias was claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Royals, but the Royals designated Arias for assignment on 19 December to make room on the 40-man roster for the prospects acquired in the Zack Greinke trade.\nSan Francisco Giants (2012–2015).\nThe San Francisco Giants signed Arias to a minor league contract on 15 December 2011. After spending the 2012 Spring training with the Giants, he was assigned to Fresno Grizzlies, Giants' Triple-A affiliate, on 5 April. He played 18 games for the Grizzlies, hitting .400 with 2 home runs and 17 runs batted in (RBIs). The Giants called up Arias on 25 April.\n2012.\nArias hit his first major-league home run in his 331st career major-league at-bat on 22 May 2012. The two-run homer off Milwaukee Brewers starting pitcher Shaun Marcum gave San Francisco a 4–0 lead in the 4th inning of a game the Giants would go on to win by a score of 6–4. On 13 June 2012, playing third base, Arias fielded a tricky grounder by Jason Castro, who was pinch-hitting for Xavier Cedeño. Arias, stumbling backwards as he gloved the ball, quickly threw the baseball to first base for the final out of Matt Cain's perfect game. On 22 August 2012, he accumulated a single-game career high of five RBIs. In total, Arias appeared in 112 games of the 2012 regular season, batting .270 with 5 home runs and 34 RBIs. He was also hit by pitches a team-high 5 times.\nThe Giants finished the 2012 season as World Series Champions. During the postseason Arias appeared in 12 games, all of them as a mid- to late-inning replacement. On 10 October, during the Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Arias entered the game in the fourth inning and had two hits in three times at bat. Both hits were doubles, after both of which Arias eventually scored runs in a game the Giants won 8–3. Overall for the postseason, Arias went 3-for-8 (.375) with three runs scored.\n2013.\nOn 24 June 2013, Arias left a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the second inning with a left hamstring injury after scoring from first base on a double by Andrés Torres. The injury only sidelined Arias for a little over a week and he took the field for the Giants against the Cincinnati Reds on 3 July. However, his return proved to be short-lived when he required an emergency appendectomy late on the night of 7 July. The following day the Giants placed him on the 15-day disabled list. He was re-activated and returned to the team on 26 July. Arias started 47 games, appeared in 102 games, batting .271 with 19 RBIs.\n2014.\nOn 23 January 2014, Arias and the Giants agreed on a two-year, $2.6-million contract. Arias appeared in 107 games, batting .254 with 15 RBIs. In the 2014 postseason, Arias appeared in 8 games, batting 2-for-4 with one RBI and two runs scored, as the Giants won the 2014 World Series over the Kansas City Royals.\n2015.\nOn 28 April 2015, Arias hit 3-for-3 off Clayton Kershaw, becoming the first Giant get three hits off Kershaw in one game. Arias appeared in 40 games, batting .207, before being designated for assignment on 27 July. Árias cleared waivers and was assigned to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn 13 December 2015, Arias signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was released on 31 March 2016."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Minnesota Twins, and San Diego Padres during a career that spanned from 2007 through 2018. Hughes stands tall and weighs . He was the Yankees' first-round pick in the 2004 MLB draft.\nDuring his time in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes became one of the most highly anticipated prospects in baseball. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short his outing, as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the majors, eventually becoming a relief pitcher in June and pitching as a setup man for Mariano Rivera. Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.\nUpon returning to the Yankees' starting rotation in 2010, Hughes won 18 games and earned a berth on the American League All-Star team. Arm fatigue cost Hughes nearly half of the season in 2011. The following year, he stayed healthy for the entire season and won 16 games as the Yankees' third starter. In 2013, Hughes had his worst season, posting a 4–14 win–loss record and a 5.19 earned run average; this performance led to his removal from the starting rotation. After signing with the Minnesota Twins, Hughes had a turnaround season in 2014, finishing the season with a 16–10 record and an ERA of 3.52 and placing seventh in the American League Cy Young Award voting. Hughes ended his career with an 88–79 record and an earned run average of 4.52.\nEarly life.\nHughes was born in Mission Viejo, California on June 24, 1986, and attended Foothill High School in North Tustin, California, where he was a first-team High School All-American pitcher and had one perfect game. In his junior year (2003), he had a 12–0 record and posted an 0.78 earned run average (ERA) while striking out 85 batters in 72 innings. In his senior year (2004), he had an 0.69 ERA and a 9–1 record. In 61 innings, he gave up 41 hits and three walks while striking out 83 batters.\nHughes first committed to Santa Clara University, but he chose to sign with the New York Yankees when they selected him in the first round, with the 23rd overall selection, of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. The Yankees were awarded this pick as compensation when free agent pitcher Andy Pettitte signed with the Houston Astros.\nProfessional baseball career.\nMinor leagues.\nIn 2004, Hughes pitched five scoreless innings for the rookie Gulf Coast League Yankees, striking out eight hitters. He spent 2005, his first full professional year, between the Class A Charleston RiverDogs and the Advanced A Tampa Yankees. He had a 9–2 record and a 1.24 ERA, and in innings he gave up 54 hits while striking out 93.\nAfter attending spring training with the Yankees in 2006, Hughes began the season with Tampa. He was promoted to the Double-A Trenton Thunder of the Eastern League at the beginning of May after he had a 2–3 record and a 1.80 ERA with Tampa while striking out 30 batters in 30 innings.\nOn June 13, Hughes took a no-hitter into the sixth inning and threw a one-hitter through seven innings in a 3–0 victory over the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Ten days later, he put forth another dominant start, taking a no-hitter into the eighth inning and pitching eight shutout innings in a 4–0 win over the Connecticut Defenders. With Trenton, Hughes had a 10–3 record, a 2.25 ERA, and 138 strikeouts in 116 innings. He made one appearance in the Eastern League playoffs, earning a no-decision after pitching six innings of 1-run ball with 13 strikeouts. After the season, he won the Kevin Lawn \"Pitcher of the Year\" Award as the top Yankees' minor league pitcher.\nEntering 2007, \"Baseball America\" rated Hughes the Yankees' #1 prospect, said he had the best curveball and best control in the Yankee system, and called him \"arguably the best pitching prospect in the minors.\" \"Baseball America\" also named him the fourth-best prospect in baseball. \"MiLB.com\" named Hughes the top right-handed starting pitching prospect in the AL East farm systems. In January 2007, the Yankees announced that Hughes was being invited to spring training. According to Bryan Hoch of \"MLB.com\", scouts believed that Hughes was ready for the major leagues. Hughes began 2007 pitching for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the International League (IL).\nNew York Yankees.\n2007.\nFollowing injuries to several Yankees' starters in 2007, Hughes was called up to the major leagues in April. Hughes made his major league debut on April 26 against the Toronto Blue Jays. In innings, he allowed four runs on seven hits, earning his first career loss. In his second major league start on May 1 against the Texas Rangers, he was maintaining a no-hitter through innings before pulling his left hamstring while facing his future teammate Mark Teixeira. Mike Myers later allowed a hit, but Hughes earned his first career win. After the game, he was placed on the disabled list (DL). He returned on August 4 against the Kansas City Royals, allowing six runs in innings and earning a no-decision in a 16–8 victory. In his final start of the year, on September 27 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, he allowed one run in a season-high seven innings and earned the win in a 3–1 victory. In 17 starts for the Yankees, Hughes had a 5–3 record, a 4.46 ERA, and 58 strikeouts in innings pitched. He was the second-youngest American League (AL) player in 2007.\nHughes was included on the Yankees' postseason roster as a long reliever. He made his first postseason appearance in 2007 against the Cleveland Indians in the AL Division Series (ALDS), giving up one run in two innings in Game 1, a 12–3 loss. In Game 3, Hughes (the youngest player on the Yankees' roster) relieved an injured Roger Clemens (the oldest player on the roster) in the third inning and pitched scoreless innings. He struck out four and earned his first playoff win. The Yankees were eliminated in four games in the series.\n2008.\nPrior to the 2008 season, it was reported by numerous news sources that the Yankees were thinking of including Hughes in a trade to the Minnesota Twins for Johan Santana. The trade never happened; Santana was traded to the New York Mets instead.\nHughes began the 2008 season as the third starter in the Yankees' rotation. In his first six starts, he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA. On April 30, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained oblique and cracked rib. On a May 2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found to be slightly nearsighted.\nAfter recovering from the rib injury, Hughes pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre; he helped them win the 2008 International League title, earning the win after striking out 12 batters in the clinching game. On September 13, a day after the IL playoffs, Hughes was recalled by the Yankees. On September 17, Hughes made his first start since April 29, giving up one earned run over four innings and earning a no-decision in a 5–1 victory over the Chicago White Sox. In his final start of the season, on September 24, he gave up two runs in eight innings and received a no-decision in a ten-inning, 6–2 victory over Toronto. He finished the season with an 0–4 record, a 6.62 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in eight starts. Because injuries severely limited his workload during the season, the Yankees sent Hughes to the Arizona Fall League after the season to pitch more innings.\n2009.\nAlthough he had a solid performance in spring training, Hughes began the 2009 season in Triple-A. He was called up to the majors in April after Chien-Ming Wang was placed on the disabled list. Hughes made his first start of the season on April 28 against the Detroit Tigers and pitched six scoreless innings, earning his first win since 2007 in an 11–0 victory. On May 25, Hughes threw eight scoreless innings, earning the win in an 11–1 victory over the Rangers.\nAfter he posted a 3–2 record and a 5.45 ERA in seven starts, Hughes was moved to the bullpen when Wang returned to the rotation in early June. Hughes pitched well, becoming the primary setup man to Mariano Rivera in July due to injuries to Brian Bruney and Dámaso Marte. Despite his success as a reliever, Cashman maintained that Hughes would be a starter over the long-term.\nHughes's first regular season win in relief came on July 17, when he threw two scoreless innings in a 5–3 victory over Detroit. On July 23, he recorded his first career save after a 6–3 Yankees victory over the Oakland Athletics. He relieved CC Sabathia in the eighth inning and pitched two perfect innings. From June 10 through July 3, he had a inning scoreless streak, the longest by a Yankee reliever since Rivera had a inning scoreless streak in 1999. In 44 games as a relief pitcher in 2009, Hughes posted a 1.40 ERA; he had 65 strikeouts in innings.\nHughes pitched in all three games of the ALDS against the Minnesota Twins, posting a 9.00 ERA. In Game 5 of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, he suffered a loss when he gave up a run and also allowed an inherited runner to score in the 7–6 defeat. He had scoreless outings in Games 2 and 3 as the Yankees won the series in six games. He had a 16.20 ERA in the World Series, but he won his first World Series ring as the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.\n2010.\nOn March 25, 2010, Hughes was named the Yankees' fifth starter. Throughout the season, the Yankees occasionally had Hughes skip starts to limit his innings, in hopes that this would help him stay healthy. On April 21, Hughes carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the Athletics before allowing a leadoff single to Eric Chavez; he faced two more hitters prior to being relieved, having struck out 10 batters.\nHe won his first five decisions, a streak snapped May 22 by the New York Mets. He followed with another five-game win streak, the last coming against the Mets on June 19. After missing a start, he saw this win streak come to an end June 29 against the Seattle Mariners.\nHughes was named to the AL All-Star Team, Sunday, July 4. Five days after his first selection to the midsummer classic, Hughes threw seven innings and gave up one run to beat the Mariners 6–1. His next outing, the All-Star Game, did not go well. Hughes, after retiring the first batter he faced in the seventh inning, allowed a pair of singles to Scott Rolen and Matt Holliday before yielding to Matt Thornton; Rolen and Holliday scored the tying and go-ahead runs on Brian McCann's three-run double that proved decisive in the NL's 3–1 victory. On August 14, Hughes allowed three runs in six innings, earning the win in an 8–3 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Hughes had 18 wins (tied for fourth in the AL with Trevor Cahill and Justin Verlander behind Sabathia, who had 21, and Jon Lester and David Price, who both had 19), only 8 losses, and a 4.19 ERA while striking out 146 batters in innings of work. His run support of 6.48 runs per game was the highest in the major leagues.\nHughes made his first postseason start in Game 3 of the ALDS against the Twins. He threw seven shutout innings to earn the win in the clinching game of the series as the Yankees beat the Twins 6–1. Game 2 of the ALCS against the Rangers did not go as well for Hughes, who allowed seven runs in four innings and earned the loss as the Yankees were defeated 7–2. He allowed four runs in innings in Game 6 and earned another loss as the Yankees lost 6–1 and were eliminated from the postseason.\n2011.\nHughes began the 2011 season as the third starter in the Yankees rotation. He suffered from a dip in velocity, with his four-seam fastball decreasing to , compared to his previous . After opening the season 0–1 with a 13.94 ERA in three starts, Hughes was placed on the DL due to a dead arm syndrome. It was later revealed that Hughes had been suffering from shoulder inflammation. He underwent an arm strength rehabilitation program for several weeks. On July 6, he made his first start in nearly 3 months, pitching five innings, allowing two earned runs, striking out and walking two batters, in a 5–3 loss to the Cleveland Indians. On August 2, in a rain-shortened game, Hughes threw his first career shutout as the Yankees defeated the White Sox 6–0 in six innings. Late in September, Hughes was moved to the bullpen after back stiffness caused him to miss a start. In 17 games (14 starts), Hughes had a 5–5 record, a 5.79 ERA, and 47 strikeouts in innings pitched.\nHughes was included on the Yankees' postseason roster as a relief pitcher. He had scoreless outings in Games 4 and 5 of the ALDS as the Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers in five games.\n2012.\nOn January 16, 2012, Hughes signed a one-year deal worth $3.25 million that included incentives, effectively avoiding arbitration. His deal was a $500,000 raise from his 2011 season.\nHughes was the Yankees' third starter in 2012. He started the season averaging only four innings in his first four starts while posting a 1–3 record and a 7.88 ERA. From May to the end of the season, however, Hughes had a 15–10 record and a 3.90 ERA. He had a season-high four-game winning streak from May 22 through June 15. Hughes threw a complete game on June 3, allowing one run in a 5–1 win against the Tigers. On June 26, he threw eight shutout innings and earned the win in a 6–4 victory over Cleveland. He threw shutout innings and earned the win on September 13 in a 2–0 victory over the Boston Red Sox. In 32 starts, Hughes had a 4.19 ERA and 165 strikeouts in innings pitched. He was tied for sixth in the AL in wins (16, with Max Scherzer, Yu Darvish, and Hiroki Kuroda), but he also tied for eighth in the league in losses (13, with Dan Haren and Ervin Santana).\nIn Game 4 of the ALDS against the Baltimore Orioles, Hughes allowed one run in innings but received a no-decision in a 13-inning, 2–1 loss. The Yankees won the series in five games. In Game 3 of the ALCS against Detroit, Hughes allowed one run in three innings before exiting with back stiffness; he took the loss as the Yankees lost 2–1. The Tigers swept the Yankees in four games.\n2013.\nHughes began the 2013 season on the DL with a bulging disc in his back. He returned from the DL on April 6, allowing four runs (three earned) in four plus innings and earning the loss as Detroit won 8–4. On May 15 against the Seattle Mariners, Hughes only lasted of an inning after giving up seven runs, six hits, two walks, including a grand slam to former Yankee Raúl Ibañez in a 12–2 Yankee loss. It was the shortest start of his career and at the time the shortest non-injury start by a Yankee at the new Yankee Stadium.\nAfter Hughes pitched to a 4–13 record and a 4.86 ERA, with a 5.71 ERA in the second half, the Yankees removed Hughes from the rotation on September 4. Hughes went 1–10 in home starts in 2013, making him just the second MLB pitcher to win fewer than two games when making at least 15 home starts in a season.\nMinnesota Twins.\n2014.\nHughes agreed to a three-year contract worth $24 million with the Minnesota Twins on November 30, 2013. The deal was confirmed by the Twins on December 5, 2013. His first start for the Twins came against the White Sox in Chicago on April 3. Hughes threw five innings, giving up four earned runs and striking out seven. He received a no-decision as the Twins won the game 10-9. His first win in a Twins uniform came in his fourth start, where he limited the Kansas City Royals to three earned runs over six innings in an 8-3 victory on April 20.\nHughes emerged as the Twins' ace in 2014. On June 1, Hughes faced the Yankees for the first time in his career, pitching at Yankees Stadium for the first time since signing with the Twins. Hughes delivered, giving up just two earned runs on three hits across eight innings and earning the win in a 7-2 victory. Three starts later, he pitched his first complete game in over two years, throwing eight innings of two-run ball in a tough loss against the Red Sox in Boston. On September 13, Hughes struck out a career-high 11 batters over seven plus innings in a 5-1 loss to the White Sox, becoming the first Twins pitcher to strike out 10 or more batters in a single game in over two years. \nHughes finished the 2014 season with a win–loss record of 16–10 alongside a career-best 3.52 ERA and 1.13 WHIP. He topped the 200-inning threshold for the first time in his career, pitching innings (10th-most in the AL) in 32 starts. Hughes struck out a career-high 186 batters to go against a measly 16 walks, the fewest ever for a pitcher with more than 200 innings. He also set a new record for the best strikeout-to-walk ratio posted by a starting pitcher in a single season in MLB history (11.625), breaking the previous record of 11.000 set by Bret Saberhagen 20 years earlier. \nHughes received both of the Twins' most prestigious player awards (the Joseph W. Haynes Pitcher of the Year Award and the Calvin R. Griffith MVP Award) for his performance throughout the season on an otherwise disappointing Twins team that finished last in the AL Central Division. He also finished seventh in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award. On December 22, 2014, Hughes and the Twins agreed on a three-year extension worth $42 million.\n2015.\nHughes was the Twins' Opening Day starter in 2015, losing 4-0 to the Detroit Tigers. During the 2015 season, Hughes's performance regressed. In August, he was placed on the disabled list with back problems. For the season, Hughes had an 11-9 record and an ERA of 4.40. In addition, he allowed 29 home runs in innings, the highest total in major league baseball.\n2016.\nOn June 9, 2016, Hughes was struck in the left knee off a line drive from J. T. Realmuto and left the game. The next day, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to left knee contusion. On June 11, it was revealed that there was a non-displaced fracture of the femur in the left knee. He was ruled out for 6–8 weeks. On June 12, he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. On June 28, Hughes' season was declared over as he required season-ending surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. He finished the 2016 season with a 1–7 record and a 5.95 ERA.\n2017.\nFor the 2017 season, Hughes began the season as the Twins fourth starter. He went on the disabled list at the end of May due to biceps tendinitis. Upon his return from the disabled list, due to not being able to regain his complete stamina, Hughes agreed to head to the bullpen to build up strength. On July 18, Hughes was declared out for the season due to recurring symptoms of thoracic syndrome.\n2018.\nHughes was in the rotation at the beginning of the season. After two starts, he landed on the disabled list. Upon his return, he was sent to the bullpen. Hughes was designated for assignment by the Twins on May 22, 2018. Hughes ended his five-year with the Twins with a 32–29 record and a 4.43 ERA.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn May 27, 2018, the Twins traded Hughes, along with cash and the 74th pick in the 2018 MLB draft, to the San Diego Padres in exchange for minor-league catcher Janigson Villalobos. Upon being acquired, he was put in the bullpen. Hughes pitched to a 6.10 ERA in innings. The Padres designated Hughes for assignment on August 10 and released him on August 16. \nOn January 3, 2021, Hughes officially announced his retirement from professional baseball on his Twitter account.\nScouting report.\nHughes's pitch repertoire varied over the years, although his main pitch was a four-seam fastball at 92–95 mph. He also relied on a spike curveball in the range of 73–77 mph. Hughes developed a mid-80s Vulcan changeup against left-handed hitters. Hughes added a cut fastball in the high 80s as a weapon against right-handers in the 2008 season, and he used the pitch 16% of the time in the 2009 and 2010 seasons:\nHughes asserted that a hamstring injury he suffered in his rookie year permanently altered his pitching mechanics: \"My stride, and things like that, have never quite been the same.\"\nIn early 2011, Hughes's fastball velocity had dropped by several miles per hour. Hughes continued to use the cutter into the start of the 2012 season; he posted a 7.88 ERA in April, throwing the cutter about 12% of the time in this span. In early May, Hughes dropped the cutter from his repertoire, using it only 1.2% of the time for the rest of the year.\nIn mid-2012, Hughes developed a low-80s slider that he used against right-handers.\nHughes threw a disproportionate number of his pitches high in the strike zone and above the zone.\nPersonal life.\nHughes and his wife, Sarah, were married in November 2016. They welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Harrison, in the fall of 2019.\nHughes is a Christian. His baseball glove has the reference for the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 on it, and Hughes has the entire verse (\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\") tattooed on his left arm. \nAs a child, Hughes was a Boston Red Sox fan. He had a poster of Nomar Garciaparra with the slogan \"Reverse the Curse\" on his bedroom wall.\nHughes enjoys watching the Food Network and is a fan of Alton Brown. He became a fan of the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2005, after he began training at the Yankees' facility in Tampa.\nHughes is an avid sports card collector. Since September 2019, he has recorded and published videos of himself opening packs to YouTube under the channel name Phil’s Pulls."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 1992 Summer Olympics took place on 28 July at the Piscines Bernat Picornell in Barcelona, Spain. There were 44 competitors from 34 nations. Each nation had been limited to two swimmers in the event since 1984. The event was won by Martín López-Zubero of Spain. Vladimir Selkov of the Unified Team took silver, while Stefano Battistelli of Italy earned bronze. It was the first medal in the men's 200 metre backstroke for each nation (though the Soviet Union, from the former republics of which the Unified Team was formed, had taken gold in 1988).\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 1988 Games returned: fifth-place finisher Dirk Richter of East Germany (now competing for Germany) and eighth-place finisher Rogério Romero of Brazil. The medalists at the 1991 World Aquatics Championships had been Martín López-Zubero of Spain, Stefano Battistelli of Italy, and Vladimir Selkov of the Soviet Union. All three competed in Barcelona (with Selkov now representing the Unified Team). López-Zubero was also the world record holder, having broken it twice in 1991. He was the favourite in the event, with European championships in both 100 metres and 200 metres in 1991 to go along with his World title and world record.\nColombia, Estonia, Fiji, Israel, Kuwait, Norway, Paraguay, and Turkey each made their debut in the event; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. Australia and Great Britain each made their eighth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats and final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. A \"consolation final\" had been added in 1984. There were 6 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The next 8 (9th through 16th) competed in a consolation final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe eight fastest swimmers advanced to final A, while the next eight went to final B.\nFinals.\nThe finals were held on the evening of 28 July.\nFinal A.\nSelkov went out first and led for most of the first three lengths. Itoi took the lead at the third turn. López-Zubero and Battistelli finished strong, with the former taking the lead with 25 metres to go; the latter caught Itoi but not Selkov."

        "text": "Michael Alan Burton (born 18 December 1945, in Maidenhead) is a former English rugby union footballer, who won a reputation as an uncompromising prop forward for Gloucester, England and the British and Irish Lions.\nClub career.\nBurton arrived at Kingsholm from the local club Longlevens RFC and made his debut in the Gloucester front row at the age of 18 on 14 November 1964. He went on to make 366 appearances before retiring in 1978.\nHe was captain of Gloucester in the 1975 season and played 50 times at provincial level for Gloucestershire including 39 appearances in the County Championship, winning it four times and leading the county pack in a crushing 62-10 victory over Japan at Kingsholm in September 1976. It was with Gloucestershire that he made his third tour of South Africa in the same year.\nHe won the RFU National Cup (then the John Player Cup) with Gloucester at Twickenham in 1972 against Moseley and again in 1978 against Leicester.\nIn between those important championship wins, in 1977 Burton was honoured with an invitation to play for a \"World XV\" at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris against the Grand Slam champions France. \nThe World XV was assembled to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the Federation Francaise de Rugby and Burton was one of only three English international players included. The others were hooker Peter Wheeler and Number 8 Andy Ripley. \nIn October 1972, Burton scored a famous try for the Western Counties against the touring All Blacks at Kingsholm and played for the same regional team in the 15–14 win over Australia at Bath a year later.\nBurton was also a member of the Gloucester squad that toured the US in 1977 and returned home with an unblemished record.\nInternational career.\nBurton made his England debut in 1972 against Wales and toured South Africa for the first time with an undefeated England side that year as a member of the test team that beat the Springboks 18-9 at Ellis Park.\nA broken leg, sustained during an England training session at Twickenham in November 1972, saw him miss the autumn international against the All Blacks and the Five Nations matches in the early part of 1973 but he fought his way back to fitness and recovered well enough to be included in the England squad to tour Fiji and New Zealand later that year.\nHe toured Australia with England in 1975 where he became the first Englishman to be sent off at international level.\nIn the second Test against Australia (\"The Battle of Brisbane\") Burton was sensationally dismissed after just three minutes by local Queensland referee Bob Burnett for a late tackle on the Australian winger Doug Osborne.\nIn 1974 Burton toured South Africa for a second time, this time as a member of Willie John McBride's invincible British and Irish Lions team. He played 28 times for England in all, 17 times in Tests, and represented the Barbarians on eight occasions.\nPost career.\nAfter retiring from rugby, Burton became a successful businessman in the field of corporate hospitality, specialist sports travel and player representation. His business interests took him around the world and he had a short spell playing recreational rugby in Canada for Toronto Lions.\nHe gave a great deal back to the game in later years by dedicating his time and business experience to the Barbarian FC as an influential member of the club's management board and also serving on the Board of Governors at Gloucester's successful rugby nursery Hartpury College.\nHis contribution to Gloucester Rugby was recognised during the clubs 150th anniversary celebrations when on Saturday the 23rd of March 2024 at Kingsholm Stadium Mike Burton was inducted into the Gloucester Rugby Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Peter Chiarelli (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Peter Chiarelli (born August 5, 1964) is a Canadian ice hockey executive and former player. He is the Vice President of Hockey Operations for the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League. He previously served as general manager of both the Boston Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers, winning the Stanley Cup with the Bruins in 2011. Both of his tenures as general manager ended with his being fired, with his Oilers managerial career in particular a source of controversy.\nPlaying career.\nChiarelli played for Harvard University between 1983 and 1987, serving as the captain of the team. During his freshman year there, he lived in Straus Hall, where Seth Goldman was one of his roommates. Professionally he played for the Nottingham Panthers of the British Hockey League (BHL).\nExecutive career.\nEarly career.\nPrior to becoming an NHL executive, Chiarelli was a player agent before joining the Ottawa Senators in 1999. He was also an attorney in private practice in Ottawa having graduated from the University of Ottawa's law school. Chiarelli served as the assistant general manager for the Ottawa Senators for two years, including the cancelled 2004–05 lockout season.\nBoston Bruins (2006–2015).\nChiarelli was hired on May 26, 2006 as the general manager of the Boston Bruins, signed to a four-year contract. However, due to NHL rules, he was required to wait until July 8 to assume his duties in Boston, instead finishing out his time as an assistant general manager with the Senators. This precluded him from making decisions for the Bruins at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, which was handled by interim general manager Jeff Gorton.\nGorton made a number of highly consequential moves that would form the bedrock of Chiarelli's tenure, first trading the Bruins' Calder Memorial Trophy-winning young goaltender Andrew Raycroft to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Tuuka Rask. Raycroft would never realize his early potential, while Rask became a Vezina Trophy-winning franchise mainstay for over a decade, and the trade was in retrospect considered a decisive win for the Bruins and one of the worst in Leafs history. Shortly thereafter he signed Zdeno Chára in free agency, who would remain for fourteen years, all of that time as captain, winning the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the league's best defenceman along the way. At the draft, Gorton selected Phil Kessel in the first round and Milan Lucic in the second, and traded up to select future core player Brad Marchand in the third. After Chiarelli assumed his managerial duties, Gorton returned to his role as an assistant, but was dismissed by Chiarelli a year later. \nIn the following years Chiarelli made consequential additions including Johnny Boychuk, Andrew Ference and Dennis Wideman, the latter later used to acquire Nathan Horton in trade. On June 19, 2009, Chiarelli received a four-year contract extension through the 2013–14 season. Afterward, he made Boston's second major trade with the Maple Leafs in this period, after concluding that Bruins star forward Kessel could not be re-signed. Instead he was traded to the Maple Leafs in exchange for a package that included two unprotected first round draft picks. Due to the poor performance of the Maple Leafs in subsequent years, both of those were in the top ten, allowing the Bruins to select Tyler Seguin second overall in 2010 and Dougie Hamilton ninth overall in 2011. This trade, similar to the Raycroft/Rask trade three years prior, was considered one of the Leafs' worst. On June 15, 2011, Chiarelli won the Stanley Cup with the Bruins. \nThe Bruins would reach the Stanley Cup Finals for a second time under Chiarelli, in 2013, shortly after which he signed another four-year contract extension. The Bruins won the Presidents' Trophy as the team with the best regular season record for 2013–14. However, the later years of Chiarelli's tenure were not as successful managerially, and he became increasingly the object of criticism for perceived poor trades and salary cap management decisions. In particular, it was widely believed that he had not received adequate return for trading Seguin to the Dallas Stars in 2013. Things came to a head in the 2014–15 season, which began on a sour note when Chiarelli traded Boychuk to the New York Islanders. This trade was prompted by the Bruins lacking salary cap space, which was in turn blamed on many of the contracts that Chiarelli had opted to sign. Boychuk's absence from the team's defensive corps would hurt in the season that followed, particularly because of a lengthy injury to Chára. Struggling with injuries and subpar performances by key players, the Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, and on April 15, 2015 Chiarelli was fired. Reviewing his tenure at the time of his dismissal, \"Sports Illustrated\" opined that he had \"built a nice legacy\" in Boston, but faulted the later years as \"marred by trade disasters, misplaced loyalties and salary cap mismanagement.\" However, they also suggested that he would soon be hired by another team.\nEdmonton Oilers (2015–2019).\nOn April 24, 2015, nine days after he was fired by the Bruins, the Edmonton Oilers announced Chiarelli's hiring as general manager and president of hockey operations. As general manager, his first task was to prepare for the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, where the Oilers held the first overall pick after winning the draft lottery, as well as other high draft picks in what would prove in many assessments to be the deepest draft of the decade. With the first overall pick, the Oilers selected Connor McDavid, hailed as the most talented prospect since Sidney Crosby a decade earlier. However, at the same time Chiarelli made another decision that would in retrospect be considered one of his worst, trading the sixteenth and thirty-third overall picks to the New York Islanders for defenceman Griffin Reinhart. Reinhart would ultimately play only 29 games for the Oilers, considered a draft bust, while the Islanders would use the sixteenth overall pick in the deep draft to select star forward Matthew Barzal. Chiarelli moved other draft picks to acquire goaltender Cam Talbot from the New York Rangers.\nIn the leadup to the 2016–17 season, Chiarelli made two widely faulted moves, the first being the trade of former first overall draft pick Taylor Hall to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Adam Larsson. Hall would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player with the Devils, while Larsson had a largely unremarkable tenure with the Oilers. At the same time, former Bruin Milan Lucic was signed to a 7-year, $42 million contract. This signing was criticized as at the time the game was perceived to be transitioning away from the style in which Lucic excelled. Despite this, the season itself was a success for the team, with the Oilers qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in ten years and advancing to the second round, narrowly losing to the Anaheim Ducks. Much of the Oilers' success that season was attributed to Talbot in goal, as well as a Hart-winning season from McDavid.\nExpectations were raised for the Oilers following this playoff run. However, Chiarelli made another of his most widely-criticized moves in the 2017 offseason, trading winger Jordan Eberle to the Islanders for Ryan Strome, who was in turn traded to the Rangers for Ryan Spooner. Eberle would become a mainstay in New York for years, while Spooner's contributions in Edmonton were limited. Conversely, his decision to sign emerging star Leon Draisaitl to an 8-year, $68 million contract, while controversial at the time, would eventually come to be regarded as one of the league's best-value contracts. The 2017–18 season saw the Oilers regress markedly from their prior results, and they did not qualify for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs despite McDavid leading the league in scoring for the second consecutive year.\nThe 2018–19 season started little better than the preceding, and by mid-January the team had a 23–24–3 record, on course to miss the playoffs again. The Oilers announced his firing on January 22, 2019. His last action as general manager had been to sign Finnish goaltender Mikko Koskinen to a three-year, $13.5 million contract despite his having played less than a season in the NHL. While team executive Bob Nicholson would subsequently claim that the contract extension for Koskinen had been a group decision of management, many in the media speculated that its proximity to Chiarelli's firing were indicative of a causal connection. The contract was later called \"Chiarelli's last salvo,\" hampering the team's goaltending budget and capacity in the seasons that followed.\nLater years.\nIn September of 2021, Chiarelli was hired by the St. Louis Blues as vice president of hockey operations. He later interviewed for the position of general manager of the Chicago Blackhawks, but the franchise ultimately hired Kyle Davidson for that position.\nPersonal life.\nChiarelli resides in Boston. He is related to former Mayor of Ottawa Bob Chiarelli and former Ottawa City Councillor Rick Chiarelli.\nChiarelli's brother Mike Chiarelli joined the Boston Bruins as a scout in 2007.\nChiarelli obtained his law degree from the University of Ottawa in 1991.\nHis daughter, Talia Chiarelli, was a member of the Canadian National Gymnastics Team and in 2012 accepted a scholarship at the University of Michigan. His son, Cameron, played club hockey at Harvard University."

        "text": "The Syracuse Stars were a minor professional ice hockey team from Syracuse, New York, for ten seasons from 1930–31 to 1939–40. The Stars name had previously been used by sports teams, including several Syracuse Stars baseball teams from the 19th century. The team played at the New York State Fair Coliseum on the New York State Fairgrounds. The Stars were affiliated with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Americans.\nHistory.\nIn 1930, the Hamilton Tigers International Hockey League (IHL) franchise was purchased by Percy LeSueur and partners and transferred to Syracuse to become the Syracuse Stars. LeSueur also managed the Syracuse Arena and coached the Stars team for part of the first season before giving way to Frank Foyston. The Stars hockey team played their first six seasons in the IHL from 1930 to 1936, and then in the International-American Hockey League from 1936 to 1940. The Stars were an affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs for the 1932–33 season and then from 1934 until 1939. The Stars had a one-season affiliation with the New York Americans in 1933–34.\nThe first five seasons for the Stars did not produce any championships. However, they won the IHL's regular season East Division in 1935–36 during their sixth season.\nDuring the 1936–37 season in the IAHL, Syracuse won the F. G. \"Teddy\" Oke Trophy as West Division champions, and became the first ever Calder Cup champions after beating the Philadelphia Ramblers in the finals. The Stars reached the Calder Cup finals the following season, losing to the Providence Reds.\nAfter four seasons in the IAHL, the team was acquired in 1940 by Louis Jacobs, owner of Jacob's Concessions, and relocated to Buffalo, New York to play as the Buffalo Bisons, where they played in the newly built Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. They played in Buffalo until 1970 when the National Hockey League expanded to Buffalo and created the Buffalo Sabres.\nAHL in Syracuse.\nOther AHL teams such as the Syracuse Warriors, Syracuse Eagles and Syracuse Firebirds would call Syracuse home after the Stars. The city has been home to the AHL's Syracuse Crunch since 1994. A banner memorializing the Stars inaugural AHL Calder Cup championship hung in the rafters of the Upstate Medical University Arena until 2018. The Syracuse Crunch wore replica Stars jerseys in 2011 to honor the AHL's 75th anniversary in a game versus the Lake Erie Monsters.\nSee also.\nThe name was most recently used by an AAA minor hockey organization based out of Syracuse, New York."

All events were held at the National Auditorium in Mexico City from October 21 through October 26.\nFormat of competition.\nThe scoring in all the events was similar to that of the gymnastics events at the 1960 Summer Olympics. The six best gymnasts on the apparatus in the team competition (by sum of two scores - for compulsory and optional routine) qualified for that apparatus finals. The new feature of the competition was in women's events: each of them was judged by four judges, like the men's competition. The highest and lowest marks were dropped and an average of two remaining marks constituted the score.\nControversy.\nLarisa Petrik's gold medal on floor was very controversial because originally, Čáslavská won outright. After the competition was concluded, Petrik's prelims scores were changed to let her tie with Čáslavská, an action which caused Čáslavská to publicly defy the Soviets who had recently invaded her home country. A similar controversy occurred in the balance beam, where Čáskavská was denied gold altogether."

        "title": "Cricket Canada",
        "text": "Cricket Canada, known as the Canadian Cricket Association (CCA) until November 2007, is the governing body of cricket in Canada. It was established in 1892 and has its current headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. It administers the national men's and women's teams, as well as several youth teams at various age levels. In addition, Cricket Canada and its affiliates run several grassroots and development programs and leagues nationwide. Cricket Canada is Canada's representative at the International Cricket Council and has been an associate member of that body since 1968. It is included in the ICC Americas region.\nHistory.\nIntroduced by the British, cricket was the most popular sport in Canada until the early 20th century when it was overtaken by ice hockey and other sports. Cricket was so popular it was declared the national sport by John A. Macdonald, Canada's first Prime Minister. Today, cricket is the fastest growing sport in Canada, with well over 40,000 cricketers across the nation. While Canada is not sanctioned to play Test matches, the team does take part in One Day International (ODI) matches and also in first-class games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with the rivalry against the United States being as strong in cricket as it is in other team sports. The match between these two nations is the oldest international fixture in cricket, having first been played in 1844. This international fixture even outdates the Olympics by over 50 years. The ICC sanctions a few grounds in Canada to host official ODI's. The most famous Canadian cricketer is John Davison, who was born in Canada but raised in Australia and participated in the Cricket World Cup in 2003, 2007, and 2011. At the 2003 World Cup, Davison hit the fastest century in tournament history against the West Indies in a losing cause. In that World Cup, he also smashed a half-century at a strike rate of almost 200 against New Zealand. One year later, in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the US, he proved the difference between the two sides, taking 17 wickets for 137 runs and scoring 84 runs. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, John Davison scored the second-fastest half-century against New Zealand. Canada has participated in the 1979, 2003, and 2007 Cricket World Cups. Canada has traditionally had a strong Women's team. Also, The Canadian Under 19 team has competed in the Under 19 World Cup twice. In 2002, they were eliminated in the first round, meaning they competed in the plate competition, in which they did not win a game. They repeated this performance in the 2004 competition.\nEarly 2000s.\nIn 2004, Canada lost all their games and finished in last place at the Six Nations Challenge in the United Arab Emirates. However, the team won the ICC Americas Championship in Bermuda shortly afterwards. Also in 2004, Canada participated in the first ICC Intercontinental Cup, finishing as runners-up to Scotland. The highlight of this tournament was the game against the US in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when John Davison recorded the best match bowling figures since Jim Laker's 19 wickets against Australia in 1956.\nIn 2005, Canada again finished third in the ICC Trophy, which gained them official ODI status from 2006 until the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, as well as qualifying them for the 2007 World Cup. Their performance in the Intercontinental Cup that year was not as good as in 2004 however, as they did not make it past the first round.\nIn 2006, Canada put in good performances in the four-day ICC Intercontinental Cup, beating Kenya by 25 runs and Bermuda by nine wickets. Still, their one-day form was a complete reversal, losing three times to Bermuda and Kenya, and a further loss to Zimbabwe. In August 2006, Canada took part in the Division 1 of the Americas Championship. They beat Argentina and long-time rivals the USA, but lost to the Cayman Islands and eventual winners Bermuda, and finished third, their worst performance so far in this tournament.\n2008.\nIn June and July 2008, Canada hosted Bermuda for three ODIs, and Intercontinental Cup matches against Bermuda and Scotland. In August, Canada traveled to Ireland for the World Twenty20 Qualification Tournament. Canada did not qualify for the World Twenty20, finishing 5th ahead of Bermuda. The ODIs and an Intercontinental Cup match were hampered by rain. In late summer of 2008, West Indies and Bermuda came to Canada to play One-Day Scotiabank Series with Canada. Canada defeated Bermuda to face West Indies in the Final. West Indies captain Chris Gayle smashed his sixteenth ODI century and led his side to an easy seven-wicket victory against Canada in the finals of the Scotiabank ODI Series at King City.\nDuring the Scotiabank Series the talents of Rizwan Cheema were discovered – he would become the star of the first Al-Barakah T20 Canada. The tournament involved Canada, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Canada lost all three of their matches. However, the loss to Zimbabwe came in a bowl-out. Sri Lanka was the eventual winners, defeating Pakistan in the Final. The tournament is expected to be played annually for the next four years.\nIn late November 2008, Canada participated in the Americas Championship in Florida, USA. The United States, after years of disarray, pulled together and won the championship. Canada finished 3rd on Net Run Rate behind Bermuda, as their match was washed out due to rain.\n2009.\nFollowing bold management decisions which allowed Cricket Canada to sign seven players to central contracts in 2008, and increased ICC funding in 2009, allowed to continue a move designed to regularize training sessions with a core group of cricketers. For the likes of Rizwan Cheema, who had been working in a fast-food restaurant called Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits, quitting the day job to play cricket was an easy decision; others, such as investment banker Ashish Bagai, had to mull it over before signing, even with the global financial crisis raging.\nFollowing this, the team headed to Sri Lanka for a training camp that would forever change the face of Canadian Cricket. For the first time in its history, the players were exposed to a first-class environment and responded by dominating the opening stages of the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. This led to a second-place finish and an invitation to the 2011 Cricket World Cup\n2010.\nIn late January, the Canadian team embarked for Sri Lanka to play some warm-up matches ahead of the World Twenty20 Qualifiers in the UAE, which were to be followed by two ODIs and a four-day Intercontinental Cup match against Afghanistan. In January 2010, Canada's u19 team also made history as they upset heavily favored Zimbabwe in the first match of the 2010 u19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. The Canadians built off this all-round upset to finish a best-ever 11th place at the tournament. Also in January, Canada's men's team traveled to Sri Lanka to participate in the Sri Lanka Cricket Four Nations Cup with Sri Lanka 'A', Ireland, and Afghanistan. Canada again made history by producing the first-ever live broadcast of an associates cricket match. The production was well received and has paved the way for more such broadcasts in the future.\nIn February 2010 Canada participated in the 2010 ICC T20 Cricket World Cup qualification tournament in which they failed to register a win and were eliminated after the first round.\nIn March 2010, Cricket Canada Directors, for the first time, voted in president Ranjit Saini.\nIn April 2010, Cricket Canada declared its inability to host the 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, which it had committed to hosting in 2007.\nCanada emerged winless from an April tour of the Caribbean playing Jamaica in a 50-over and Twenty20 game, West Indies XI in a Twenty20 game and the West Indies in a One-day international.\nCanada's presence in America also led to a relationship being developed with the West Indies Cricket Board. This included an invitation from WICB for Canada to participate in the Caribbean T20 tournament. Though not winning a game, the tournament was a success for Canada as a relationship was created with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. CBC webcast all of Canada's matches and had more substantial viewer ratings for this.\nIn June 2010, Canada stamped its authority in the Americas by winning all matches at the Americas Cup tournament in Bermuda and finishing finalists with winners USA in the Americas Twenty20. Canada also played Ireland in a drawn warm-up game in the Netherlands before World Cricket League Div 1 (Ireland's top-string team played Australia in Dublin).\nCanada finished the year with some energy losing the 4-day match at home to Zimbabwe and Ireland but defeating top-ranked Ireland in an ODI in front of a packed house at the Toronto Cricket Club. Cricket was firmly back in Toronto, and the team responded.\nThe year ended with the Cricket Canada summer festival at Malton Cricket Club. A strong West Indies High-Performance Team (containing players with test and ODI players) split their matches with Canada in two hard-fought contests.\nThat November, the board decided to send the team to the World Cricket Academy in India. The 4-week trip included games in 4 cities for preparation ahead of the 2011 Cricket World Cup\n2011.\nCanada played two major tournaments in the first part of 2011, the Caribbean T20 tournament. Participating for the second time in the West Indies domestic T20 competition, Canada defeated heavily favored Hampshire before fighting Trinidad and Tobago to the last ball in the opening two matches of the tournament.\nFrom the West Indies, Canada traveled to Dubai, splitting matches with Netherlands and Afghanistan before arriving at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. At this tournament, Canada recorded great performances from skipper Ashish Bagai, Henry Osinde, Jimmy Hansra, WD Balaji Rao, Hiral Patel and others as they won only their second ever match at a Cricket World Cup. The performance was steady by a young Canadian team and has set the table for an exciting future. Hansra was named captain of the team following Bagai's retirement\nCanada finished 2011 with a string of losses in both ODI's and Intercontinental Cup Matches to Afghanistan (in Toronto) and Ireland (in Dublin). Canada finished tied for first with T&amp;T and Afghanistan at the Etihad Airways Summer Cricket Festival (in Toronto)\n2012.\nCanada participated in the Caribbean T20 tournament again in 2012, losing all 4 matches. Thousands of Canadian's watched the matches on Rogers Sportsnet ONE giving the team unprecedented domestic exposure.\nFollowing the tournament, Canada participated in the 2012 T20 Cricket World Cup Qualification Tournament in UAE. Canada finished 6th in the game and did not qualify for the 2012 T20 Cricket World Cup.\nIn April, Ravin Moorthy was elected the new president of Cricket Canada, succeeding Ranjit Saini. Moorthy was joined on the board by Vimal Hardat, Amit Joshi, Charles Pais and Calvin Clarke. At this meeting, Newfoundland and Labrador were admitted to the Cricket Canada family as the 10th provincial member of the organization. The Canadian women's team won the ICC America's Division 1 T20 Tournament in April 2012. This tournament served as the preliminary round of the ICC T20 Women's Cricket World Cup, which will be played in 2014 in India. Canada has advanced to the next round of qualification.\nCanada hired former West Indian Cricketer Gus Logie as its national head coach in May 2012.\nIn November 2012, Canada's men's team will travel to the USA to play the United States in the K.A. Auty Cup. The trophy has been contested between Canada and USA since 1844, and it remains the world's oldest ongoing international sporting fixture\n2023.\nThe Canada men's cricket team played in 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off and gained One Day International (ODI) status after 9 years. They also beat their fierce rivals in that tournament, United States.\nInternational Involvement.\nCanada is one of the top associates of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Since 2008 a lot of cricket has been played in Canada involving international cricket teams from India, West Indies, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Apart from this Canada has regular schedule of competitions with other associate members. In future there is a huge scope to become an international venue for ICC and other events.\nCanada has hosted many India and Pakistan One day cricket matches in Toronto which were very successful in the past. Cricket Canada recently announced that it would be willing to host international games as a neutral venue if there are any situations that games cannot be conducted at any scheduled venues. This announcement came after Australia withdrew to travel Pakistan to play cricket after security concerns in Pakistan.\nName changes.\nCricket Canada has had two different names since its foundation. They are:\nCompetitions.\nAs well as being responsible for Canadian International sides, Cricket Canada organizes domestic inter-provincial cricket in Canada. In 2008, Cricket Canada introduced two domestic competitions that are Scotia Shield U-19 and National T20 Championship. National T20 Championship is a Twenty20 format competition with eight domestic teams. Until 2006, the Under-18 National Tournament in Canada was called as Canada Cup.\nCricket Canada's competitions:\nWomen's Cricket.\nThe Canadian women's cricket team made their international debut in September 2006 in a three-match series of one-day games against Bermuda to decide which team would represent the Americas region in the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland in 2007. Canada started well, with a five-wicket win in the first win, but Bermuda came back with 24 run win in the second. The third game went down to the wire, with Bermuda triumphing by just 3 runs.\nRegional Structure.\nCricket Canada has five regions which encompass all 10 of Canada's provinces:\nExecutive/Principals.\nCricket Canada is governed by the following key individuals:\nSponsorship.\nIn 2010 Reebok signed a multi-year agreement with Cricket Canada to be the official apparel supplier of Cricket Canada. the deal commences in 2011 and will include the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Cricket Canada also has necessary sponsorship arrangements with Mercury Communications Group (web based marketing and communications), Sports Performance Centres (Athletic Therapy Services), Accent Impressions (Printing Services), Amino Vital (sports drinks), TitanGS (web design and marketing).\nAlso, as 2010 drew to a close, Etihad Airways joined Cricket Canada as a sponsor.

The first three of those events were held at the Golf Club Mariánské Lázně in Mariánské Lázně, before moving to the Prague Karlstein Golf Club, overlooked by Karlštejn Castle, just outside Prague. Germany's former World Number 1 Bernhard Langer was much the most distinguished of the four champions.\nFollowing flood disasters in the Czech Republic in 1997, the Czech Open in the following year was canceled at the request of the sponsors, and lost its place on the European Tour schedule as a result. In its final year, the prize fund was £804,788, which was above average for a European Tour event at that time.\nHaving been contested on the satellite Alps Tour in 2008, the Czech Open returned to the European Tour schedule for the 2009 season, when it was played at the Miguel Ángel Jiménez designed Prosper Golf Resort in Čeladná towards the end of July with a prize fund of €2.5 million. It was titled as the Moravia Silesia Open in 2009, and retitled again in 2010 to the Czech Open. The 2011 Czech Open was the last one held, with the 2012 edition being scheduled, but ultimately canceled due to a lack of funds."

        "title": "Chris Childs (basketball)",
        "text": "Chris Childs (born November 20, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player, who played primarily at the guard position.\nEarly basketball career.\nChilds played his high school basketball at Foothill High School and starred at Boise State University in the late 1980s. Childs was the Big Sky Conference Player of the Year in 1989.\nDespite his collegiate success, Childs went undrafted in the 1989 NBA draft and began his professional career in the Continental Basketball Association. He played for three different teams in his first three seasons in the league, but eventually found a home with the Quad City Thunder. With the Thunder, Childs won a league title and the Continental Basketball Association MVP award in 1994 after averaging 17.9 points and 7.6 assists.\nAccording to Quad City Thunder owner Anne Potter DeLong's obituary on \"QCOnline\", Childs struggled with alcoholism during his time in the Continental Basketball Association. Childs went to DeLong for help at which point she called former NBA player George Gervin who facilitated Childs' admittance to a rehab facility in Houston, Texas. The clinic was run by retired NBA player John Lucas II.\nNBA career.\nChilds' success in the minor leagues proved to be his ticket to the NBA, as he signed with the New Jersey Nets prior to the start of the 1994–95 NBA season. He spent his first two seasons with the Nets, and averaged an NBA career-high 12.8 points in 1995–96.\nHowever, Childs was perhaps best remembered for his five-year (1996–2001) tenure with the New York Knicks, who relied on his tight defense and streaky three-point shooting ability during their perennial runs to the NBA playoffs. It was during this time that Childs helped lead the New York Knicks to the NBA Eastern Conference championship in 1999. He led the team in assists (6.1 per game) as a starter during the 1996–97 season, and was a valuable contributor off the bench during his next four years with the team. A visible figure in the New York media, he also represented the Knicks on the 1998–99 NBA All-Interview Team and won the New York Press Photographers Association's 2000 \"Good Guy Award\" for his involvement with several charities and youth basketball programs. On April 2, 2000, in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, he had a fight with Kobe Bryant late in the third quarter. The fight has been deemed to show the toughness of the Knicks during that era. At four inches shorter than Bryant, Childs punched him from the chin into his throat. Both players were ejected and the Knicks lost the game 106-82.\nIn February 2001, Childs was traded to the Toronto Raptors for Mark Jackson and Muggsy Bogues, with whom he played for one-and-a-half seasons before rejoining the Nets in 2002. During that season, on October 22, 2002, Childs was suspended by the team indefinitely for not being in playing shape. Coincidentally, that same day, Childs was held up at gunpoint by three men outside a Manhattan restaurant owned by Sean Combs. Police say the alleged thieves made off with approximately $30,000 in cash and jewelry. Childs then retired after the 2002–03 season."

The tournament was played on grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. There were 31 competitors from 9 nations. Nations could enter up to 12 players. The event was won by Major Ritchie of Great Britain, the nation's third victory in four Games. Otto Froitzheim earned Germany's first medal in the event with his silver. Another Briton, Wilberforce Eaves, took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the men's singles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984. In 1908, for the first time of two, an indoor version was held concurrently.\nThe top players did not compete in this event. Arthur Gore played only in the indoor event. William Larned, Norman Brookes, Anthony Wilding, and Laurence Doherty were noted absences. Major Ritchie was a solid player, having gone deep into Wimbledon multiple times but never having won in singles (he took doubles titles in 1908 and 1910 with Wilding).\nAustria, Bohemia, Canada, the Netherlands, and South Africa each made their debut in the event. France, Germany, and Great Britain each made their third appearance, tied for most among all nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament. For the first time at the Olympics, a bronze medal match was played. All matches were best-of-five sets.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule was impacted by rain, with matches adjourned overnight on occasion.\nThe Olympics started three days after the end of the 1908 Wimbledon Championships, a scheduling issue which the Official Report recommended avoiding in the future."

        "text": "Gene Leroy Green (June 26, 1933 – May 23, 1981) was an American Major League Baseball outfielder and catcher who played all or portions of seven MLB seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals (–), Baltimore Orioles (), Washington Senators (), Cleveland Indians (–) and Cincinnati Reds (1963). A right-handed batter and thrower, he stood tall and weighed .\nMLB career.\nBorn in Los Angeles, Green was signed by the Cardinals in 1952. He spent six full years in the Redbird farm system, hitting over 20 home runs four times, before his recall to St. Louis in September 1957. He then spent all of the season on the Cardinal roster, setting career bests in games played (137), hits (124), and batting average (.281), starting 71 games in right field and 48 as catcher. However, he struggled in 1959: he got into only 30 games for St. Louis, spent the heart of that season in the minor leagues, and was traded to the Orioles in December. Baltimore kept him at Triple-A for the full 1960 campaign, except for a September call-up and one game as the Orioles' starting right fielder on September 23.\nBut the American League was adding two new teams for 1961, including an expansion edition of the Washington Senators, creating an opportunity for Green to regain a big-league job. He was the new Senators' 23rd selection (46th overall) in the expansion draft, then led the 1961 club in home runs (18), a personal best, and slugging percentage (.489). He started 75 games at catcher and 21 more in right field. His 62 runs batted in, also a career high, were one fewer than team leader Willie Tasby's 63. \nWith Washington seeking to improve its ninth-place roster, he was traded to the Indians on October 5, only four days after the end of the regular season; in the deal, Green, veteran pitcher Dick Donovan (the AL earned run average champion), and backup infielder Jim Mahoney were exchanged for colorful centerfielder Jimmy Piersall. In a utility and pinch hitting role for the 1962 Indians, Green hit 11 home runs in just 143 at bats — one for every 13 ABs — and equalled his 1958 batting mark of .281. The following year, however, he struggled to get untracked in Cleveland; batting only .205 with two homers in 78 at bats on August 1, Green was traded to the Reds for catcher Sammy Taylor, and he hit .226 in limited service in what would be his last year in the majors. Green spent 1964 in the minors before leaving the professional game completely.\nGene Green died in St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 47.\nStatistical overview.\nGreen was below-average defensively in the outfield (.963) and adequate at catcher. He was often used as a pinch hitter during his career. His career totals include 408 games played, 307 hits, 46 home runs, 160 RBI, a .441 slugging percentage, and a lifetime betting average of .267. Career highlights include one four-hit game — two doubles and two singles against the Philadelphia Phillies (June 8, 1958), 13 three-hit games, with the most impressive being two home runs and a single, good for five runs batted in vs. the Indians (June 27, 1961), and two home runs against his old team, the Senators, good for four RBI (August 12, 1962)."

        "title": "Baseball in Japan",
        "text": "Baseball was introduced to Japan in 1872 and is Japan's most popular participatory and spectator sport. The first professional competitions emerged in the 1920s. The highest level of baseball in Japan is Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), which consists of two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League, with six teams in each league. High school baseball enjoys a particularly strong public profile and fan base, much like college football and college basketball in the United States; the Japanese High School Baseball Championship (\"Summer \"Kōshien\"\"), which takes place each August, is nationally televised and includes regional champions from each of Japan's 47 prefectures.\nIn Japanese, baseball is commonly called , combining the characters for \"field\" and \"ball\". According to the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO), the atmosphere of Japanese baseball games is less relaxed than in the United States, with fans regularly singing and dancing to team songs. In addition, as American writer Robert Whiting wrote in his 1977 book \"The Chrysanthemum and the Bat\", \"the Japanese view of life, stressing group identity, cooperation, hard work, respect for age, seniority and 'face' has permeated almost every aspect of the sport. Americans who come to play in Japan quickly realize that Baseball Samurai Style is different.\"\nIn Japan, Nippon Professional Baseball players such as Shohei Ohtani, Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui, Shigeo Nagashima and Sadaharu Oh are regarded as national stars, and their exceptional performances have boosted baseball's popularity in Japan. All of them received or were approached for the for their achievements and popularity.\nHistory.\nBaseball was first introduced to Japan as a school sport in 1872 by American Horace Wilson, an English professor at the Kaisei Academy in Tokyo. The first organized adult baseball team, called the Shimbashi Athletic Club, was established in 1878.\nThe Japanese government appointed American \"oyatoi\" in order to start a state-inspired modernization process. This involved the education ministry, who made baseball accessible to children by integrating the sport into the physical education curriculum. Japanese students, who returned from studying in the United States captivated by the sport, took government positions. Clubs and private teams such as the Shinbashi Athletic Club, along with high school and college teams, commenced the baseball infrastructure.\nAt a match played in Yokohama in 1896, a team from Tokyo's Ichikō high school convincingly defeated a team of resident foreigners from the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club. The contemporary Japanese language press lauded the team as national heroes and news of this match greatly contributed to the popularity of baseball as a school sport. Tsuneo Matsudaira in his \"Sports and Physical Training in Modern Japan\" address to The Japan Society of the UK in London in 1907 related that after the victory, \"the game spread, like a fire in a dry field, in summer, all over the country, and some months afterwards, even in children in primary schools in the country far away from Tōkyō were to be seen playing with bats and balls.\"\nProfessional baseball.\nProfessional baseball in Japan first started in the 1920s, but it was not until the , a team of all-stars established in 1934 by media mogul Matsutarō Shōriki, that the modern professional game found continued success—especially after Shōriki's club matched up against an American All-Star team that included Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Charlie Gehringer. While prior Japanese all-star contingents had disbanded, Shōriki went pro with this group, playing in an independent league.\nThe first Japanese professional league was formed in 1936, and by 1950 had grown big enough to divide into two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League, together known as Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). It is called , meaning \"professional baseball\". The pro baseball season is eight months long, with games beginning in April. Teams play 144 games (as compared to the 162 games of the American major league teams), followed by a playoff system, culminating in a championship held in October, known as the Japan Series.\nCorporations with interests outside baseball own most of the teams. Historically, teams have been identified with their owners, not where the team is based. However, in recent years, many owners have chosen to include a place name in the names of their teams; the majority of the 12 NPB teams are currently named with both corporate and geographical place names.\nMinor leagues.\nMuch like Minor League Baseball in the United States, Japan has a farm system through two minor leagues, each affiliated with Nippon Professional Baseball. The Eastern League consists of seven teams and is owned by the Central League. The Western League consists of five teams and is owned by the Pacific League. Both minor leagues play 80-game seasons.\nDifferences from Major League Baseball.\nThe rules are essentially those of Major League Baseball (MLB), but technical elements are slightly different: The Nippon league uses a smaller baseball, strike zone, and playing field. Five Nippon league teams have fields whose small dimensions would violate the American Official Baseball Rules.\nAlso unlike MLB, game length is limited and tie games are allowed. In the regular season, the limit is twelve innings, while in the playoffs, there is a fifteen-inning limit (games in Major League Baseball, by comparison, continue until there is a winner). Additionally, due to power limits imposed because of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the 2011 NPB regular season further limited game length by adding a restriction that no inning could begin more than three hours and thirty minutes after the first pitch.\nNPB teams have active rosters of 28 players, as opposed to 26 in MLB (27 on days of doubleheaders). However, the game roster has a 25-player limit. Before each game, NPB teams must designate three players from the active roster who will not appear in that contest. A team cannot have more than four foreign players on a 25-man game roster, although there is no limit on the number of foreign players that it may sign. If there are four, they cannot all be pitchers nor all be position players. This limits the cost and competition for expensive players of other nationalities, and is similar to rules in many European sports leagues' roster limits on non-European players.\nIn each of the two Nippon Professional Baseball leagues, teams with the best winning percentage go on to a stepladder-format playoff (3 vs. 2, winner vs. 1). Occasionally, a team with more total wins has been seeded below a team that had more ties and fewer losses and, therefore, had a better winning percentage. The winners of each league compete in the Japan Series.\nStrike of 2004.\nOn 18 September 2004, professional baseball players went on a two-day strike, the first strike in the history of the league, to protest the proposed merger between the Orix BlueWave and the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and the failure of the owners to agree to create a new team to fill the void resulting from the merger. The strike was settled on 23 September 2004, when the owners agreed to grant a new franchise in the Pacific League and to continue the two-league, 12-team system. The new team, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, began play in the 2005 season.\nHigh school baseball.\nIn Japan, generally refers to the two annual baseball tournaments played by high schools nationwide culminating in a final showdown at Hanshin Kōshien Stadium in Nishinomiya. They are organized by the Japan High School Baseball Federation in association with Mainichi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring (also known as \"Spring Kōshien\") and Asahi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Championship in the summer (also known as \"Summer Kōshien\").\nThese nationwide tournaments enjoy widespread popularity, arguably equal to or greater than professional baseball. Qualifying tournaments are often televised locally and each game of the final stage at Kōshien is televised nationally on NHK. The tournaments have become a national tradition, and large numbers of students and parents travel from hometowns to cheer for their local team. The popularity of these tournaments has been compared to the popularity of March Madness in the United States.\nAmateur baseball.\nAmateur baseball leagues exist all over Japan, with many teams sponsored by companies. Amateur baseball is governed by the Japan Amateur Baseball Association (JABA). Players on these teams are employed by their sponsoring companies and receive salaries as company employees, not as baseball players. The best teams in these circuits are determined via the intercity baseball tournament and the Industrial League national tournament.\nThe level of play in these leagues is very competitive; Industrial League players are often selected to represent Japan in international tournaments and Major League Baseball players such as Hideo Nomo (Shin-Nitetsu Sakai), Junichi Tazawa (Nippon Oil) and Kosuke Fukudome (Nihon Seimei), have been discovered by professional clubs while playing industrial baseball.\nInternational play.\nJapan has won the World Baseball Classic three times since the tournament was created. In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, they defeated Cuba in the finals and in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Japan defeated its arch-rival of South Korea in 10 innings to defend their title.\nIn the 2023 World Baseball Classic, they reclaimed their title by defeating the United States 3–2 in the Championship game. \nThe national team is consistently ranked one of the best in the world by the World Baseball Softball Confederation."

During the 1890s, he managed baseball teams in the United Kingdom.\nU.S. career.\nIn 1885 and 1886, Hart managed the Louisville Colonels of the major-league American Association. He then served as manager of the minor-league Milwaukee Brewers in 1887 and 1888. In 1889, Hart managed the Boston Beaneaters of the National League.\nIn 1891, Hart, who was secretary of the Chicago White Stockings (later the Chicago Colts and then the Chicago Cubs), succeeded Albert Spalding as president of the team. Hart was part-owner of the Colts team, and in the 1895 season, the entire Colts team was arrested for creating a disturbance on a Sunday, after which Hart bailed every player out.\nU.K. career.\nHart went to the U.K. in the 1890s. The professional National League of Baseball of Great Britain was started in 1890. A letter was sent to Albert Spalding in America requesting help in establishing a league. The British requested eight to ten players to coach and convert the existing players, whose primary game was usually soccer. Spalding sent Hart as a skilled manager along with several players: William J. Barr, Charles Bartlett, J. E. Prior and Leech Maskrey.\nThe original intention had been to have eight teams, but initially there were just four: Aston Villa, Preston North End Baseball Club, Stoke City and Derby Baseball Club. The first three used Jim Hart to decide the line-up of their teams, while Francis Ley at Derby made his own decisions. Hart was a director of Preston North End Baseball Club Limited."

In 1950 it was renamed the South Australian Open, although it was only in 1952 that it was opened up to players from outside the state.\nIn the late 1960s, there was no sponsor for the tournament. Therefore \"only local club professionals competed.\" In 1975 there was a similar problem. The South Australian Brewing Company did not renew its sponsorship. Due to economic trouble in the country no other companies were willing to sponsor the event. The event did not take place that year.\nThe event was retitled the Jacob's Creek Open Championship from 2002 to 2007, sponsored by the Jacob's Creek wine brand, and was co-sanctioned during that period by the United States-based Nationwide Tour.

        "title": "1929 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 17th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday, May 30, 1929. Ray Keech, who finished fourth a year earlier, took the lead for the final time on lap 158 and won his first Indianapolis 500. Keech won for car owner Maude A. Yagle, the first and to-date, only female winning owner in Indy history. Only two weeks after winning the race, Ray Keech was fatally injured in a crash at Altoona Speedway on June 15, 1929. The race was part of the 1929 AAA Championship Car season.\nThe 1929 edition was the last contested with the supercharged 91 cu. in. (1.5 L) displacement engine formula. The supercharged front-wheel drive Miller 8s dominated qualifying, sweeping the front row. A total of twelve front-wheel drive machines made the field, but Keech's rear-wheel-drive Simplex Piston Ring Special took the victory. All three cars of the front row, as well as the first two cars of the second row, dropped out before the halfway point. Pole-sitter Cliff Woodbury crashed on lap 4, and became the first pole position winner in Indy history to finish last (33rd). Defending race winner Louis Meyer was leading in the second half, but lost nearly seven minutes when his car stalled in the pits due to low oil pressure on lap 157. He finished second just over six minutes behind Keech, with the lengthy pit stop the deciding margin.\nThe hard luck story of the race belonged to Lou Moore. After finishing second in 1928, Moore was on his way to back-to-back runner-up finishes. With two laps to go, however, his engine threw a rod. Due to the rules at the time, since Moore was not running at the finish, he was scored behind all finishers. He fell all the way back to 13th position, behind four cars that actually had fewer laps than he had.\nIt was the final race of the Roaring Twenties and the final race before the Stock Market Crash and Great Depression. The facility was expanded in 1929 to include a golf course. Dubbed the \"Speedway Golf Course,\" it featured nine holes outside the track, and nine holes inside the track, and was designed by Bill Diddel. Also during the month, scenes for the movie \"Speedway\" were being filmed.\nEngine specifications and rule changes.\nThe 1929 race would be the final year contested with the supercharged 91 cu. in. (1.5 L) displacement engine formula. Speedway president Eddie Rickenbacker had decided to substantially change the engine specifications for 1930 and beyond in an effort to lure back the passenger car manufacturers, and make the cars on the track resemble more those sold to the motoring public. Rickenbacker's desire was to move away from the supercharged, specialized racing machines that had taken over the Speedway through the 1920s.\nContrary to popular belief, the proposed rules changes were not made in response to the stock market crash of 1929 (which had not occurred yet) and the subsequent Great Depression. The rule changes for 1930 were in fact being laid out as early as 1928, and were already approved by the AAA Contest Board in early January 1929. In addition, the 1929 race would be the final for the foreseeable future to be without riding mechanics. From 1930 and beyond, the rules were once again going to mandate two-man cars.\nWith the 91 c.i.d engines on their way out, interest was focused on whether the roughly 200 horsepower machines could set a track record for 500 miles in their swan song. Qualifying speeds were expected to be fast.\nFor 1929, riding mechanics were optional, however, no teams utilized them.\nJimmy Gleason's car carried #53, the first number over 50 in the history of the race.\nRace schedule.\nParticipants began arriving at the Speedway in mid-April, but very few, if any, cars took laps prior to May 1. The track was officially made available for practice beginning on Wednesday May 1. Time trials was scheduled for four days - Saturday May 25 through Tuesday May 28. Qualifying on Saturday would be held from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and qualifying on Sunday would be held from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Time trials for Monday and Tuesday was tentatively scheduled on an as-needed basis, although on Monday, rain would ultimately wash out the day.\nPreparations – April.\nAn expanded garage area greeted competitors arriving at the Speedway for 1929. During the offseason, Speedway superintendent Laurence Welch oversaw the construction of a second row of garages along the Gasoline Alley corridor.\nVeteran Indianapolis drivers Earl Devore and Norman Batten were lost at sea in November 1928 in the sinking of the \"SS Vestris\". Batten's widow Marion Batton entered the 1929 race as a car owner.\nTime trials.\nTime trials was scheduled for four days – Saturday May 25 through Tuesday May 28. A qualifying run consisted of four laps. Cars were allowed to take as many warm up laps as needed, and when the driver was ready to begin, he would hold his hand up as he came down the frontstretch. The minimum speed to make the field was set at 90 mph.\nCar that qualified on the first day lined up in the grid first, with the fastest qualifier on the first day winning the pole position. Cars qualifying on the second, third, and fourth day, regardless of speed, would line up behind the first day qualifiers. No plans were being made to allow any \"last-minute\" qualifiers on Wednesday, or on race morning. However, in case of weather, the officials would further assess the situation at the close of qualifying Tuesday evening.\nSaturday May 25.\nThe first day of time trials was held Saturday May 24, scheduled for 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. All cars in the qualifying line at 5 o'clock were allowed to make their attempt, with qualifying continuing until the track closed at sundown. On the morning of time trials, the biggest news out of the paddock was that Ralph DePalma would not attempt to qualify. After signing with the Alden Sampson team a week earlier, DePalma was prohibited from driving by his current employer. Sampson immediately replaced DePalma with Dave Evans, and Evans was expected to take to the track on Sunday.\nQualifying on Saturday saw an upset on the front row. Leon Duray was the favorite for the pole position going into the session. One year prior, Duray set the one-lap (124.018 mph) and four-lap (122.391 mph) track records. Likewise, he also held the U.S. closed-track record (148.1 mph), so he was considered the fastest driver in the field.\nLate in the afternoon, Cliff Woodbury took to the track, and tentatively put his car on the top spot. His four-lap average of 120.599 mph, however, was not near a track record. After Woodbury's run, Leon Duray took his Packard Cable Special to the bricks. He took one warm-up lap, returned to the pits for adjustments, then took two more warm-up laps. The next time around he started his run. His first lap was turned at only 120.289 mph, slower than Woodbury's average. Duray was unable to muster any more speed, and settled for second at an average of 119.087 mph.\nAlso a surprise was Ralph Hepburn who qualified third. Hepburn took the outside of the front row with a run of 116.543 mph. Peter DePaolo's run was mostly a disappointment, as he managed only 5th starting position. Chet Gardner's engine threw a rod and damaged the crankcase. Carl Marchese hit the wall, and would require repairs. Both Gardner and Marchese were expected to attempt to qualify sometime on Monday or Tuesday.\nThe day ended with fifteen cars qualified. The two slowest cars belonged to foreign drivers Louis Chiron (107.351 mph) and Jules Moriceau (105.609 mph). There was some doubt whether their speeds would hold up to make the starting field. Early predictions had been made that it would take as much as 110 mph to avoid being \"crowded out.\" However, with 18 spots left open and most of the top cars already qualified, the prediction was that any speed over 103 mph was relatively safe.\nSunday May 26.\nThe second day of time trials was held on Sunday May 26 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Any cars still in line at 5 o'clock would be able to make an attempt, with the track closing at sundown. Four additional drivers completed runs, filling the field to 19 cars. A total of 14 spots were still open. Of the 19 cars qualified, a total of 17 broke the 110 mph barrier, and all-time record for time trials at Indianapolis at the time.\nJohnny Seymour (114.307 mph) was the fastest driver of the day, posting the 10th-fastest speed overall. However, as a second day qualifier, he would line up 16th on the starting grid.\nMonday May 27.\nRain washed out qualifying on Monday May 27. Seven cars announced their intentions to get in the qualifying line, but the only track activity was practice runs. Late in the afternoon, Myron Stevens hit a bump in turn one, which veered the car to the inside wall. The car bounced off the retaining wall and back onto the track surface. Stevens was thrown from the machine as it flipped end-over-end. Stevens was checked out at the hospital and suffered only superficial injuries.\nTuesday May 28.\nThe fourth and final day of time trials was held on Tuesday May 28. The day started with fourteen spots open on the grid. Officials announced that if the field filled to 33 cars by the end of the day, there would be no further qualifying. A total of sixteen cars took to the track, and the starting grid was set.\nRain hampered most of the day. Two cars completed runs around noon, then rain resumed. At 4 p.m., the rain stopped, and the 24 cars in the qualifying line would be sent in until darkness. Ernie Triplett (114.789 mph) was the fastest driver of the day. Two drivers failed to qualify. Bill Lindau was \"crowded out\" (bumped) by Cliff Bergere, and rookie Frank Swigart (99.585 mph) was too slow. Two additional drivers, Zeke Meyer and Sam Grecco, tried to qualify in total darkness, but were too slow and officials flagged them off the track.\nStarting grid.\nThe track was closed Wednesday morning (May 29) for track cleaning. The final \"Carburation Day\" practice session was held Thursday afternoon. Phil Pardee crashed in turn three, and was sent to the hospital with slight injuries. Pardee's car was too damaged to race and was withdrawn. Officials elevated Bill Lindau, the first alternate, to 33rd starting position.\nRace summary.\nThe race began at 10 a.m. with George Hunt driving the Studebaker President Roadster pace car. Theodore \"Pop\" Meyers rode as a passenger in the pace car. Among the notable guests and celebrities in attendance were Governor Harry G. Leslie, Glenn Curtiss, Horace E. Dodge, Harvey S. Firestone, William S. Knudsen, and Ray Harroun. In addition, former Speedway president Carl G. Fisher was on hand. William Haines, Anita Page, Ernest Torrence, and Karl Dane were on hand, as filming continued on the film \"Speedway\".\nDuring the pace lap, Ralph Hepburn's car stalled. His crew was able to push-start the car, and he caught up to re-join the field. The pace lap was run at about 60-70 mph, and the field was released for the start.\nStart.\nLeon Duray took the lead from the middle of the front row. On lap 4, pole-sitter Cliff Woodbury suffered a failure in the right rear wheel. In turn three, the car skidded, then spun in turn four, backing the car into the outside wall, punching a section of the wall down. Woodbury became the first driver in Indy history to start on the pole position and finish last (33rd). Woodbury was credited with only 3 laps completed, but was uninjured, and immediately returned to the pits to drive relief for other cars.\nLeon Duray led the first seven laps, with Ray Keech second. The pace was about 109 mph. On lap 8, Deacon Litz was running third behind Duray and Keech when he realized his hand-brake had fallen off. Barreling down the backstretch, Litz veered to the inside apron to avoid crashing and possibly collecting the two other leaders. He skidded by both Duray and Keech, gathered control, and remarkably was able to take the lead cleanly. Litz was quickly able to adapt, and started pulling out to a sizable lead.\nOn lap 10, Bill Spence crashed in turn two. Spence had already been in the pits to change out all eight spark plugs. The car hit the wall and turned over several times and Spence was thrown from the cockpit. He was taken unconscious from the track, but died en route to the hospital from a fractured skull. It was the first fatal accident to occur during the race in ten years.\nFirst half.\nAfter troubles on the pace lap, Ralph Hepburn (running as high as second) dropped out on lap 14 with transmission trouble. Ray Keech made a 30-second pit stop to change a right rear tire on lap 21, and fell back to tenth position. Back out on the track, Keech began charging to catch up to the leaders.\nAttrition took a huge toll on the field in the first 75 laps. Peter DePaolo dropped out with a broken steering knuckle, and Babe Stapp suffered a broken universal joint. By lap 65, seven of the top ten qualifiers were out – including all of the top five qualifiers. Jules Moriceau crashed in turn three after completing 30 laps. He spun around four times, hitting the wall each time, then bounced back across the track. The car came to rest pointing forward, and was towed back to the pits. Moriceau was not injured, and walked back to the pits planning to drive relief.\nDeacon Litz continued to set the pace until lap 56. Lou Moore was in second, followed by Leon Duray, and Ray Keech. Billy Arnold and Tony Gulotta were also running in the top five. At the 100-mile mark (40 laps), Litz set a record average speed of 107.17 mph. After his early crash, Cliff Woodbury was already back behind the wheel around lap 30, driving relief for Billy Arnold. Arnold came to the pits with broken goggles and a cut eye, and needed relief while his injuries were tended to.\nDeacon Litz dropped out while leading with a broken rod on lap 56. According to Litz, \"something the size of a brick\" exploded out of the side of the crankcase. That handed the lead to Lou Moore. Running in second was now Louis Meyer. Moore and Meyer traded time in the lead until the halfway point.\nSecond half.\nBarney Kleopfer took over as relief driver for Lou Moore for the second half. Ray Keech and Louis Meyer, however, would go the distance without relief help. Ray Keech made his second and final pit stop on lap 109. The team changed three tires and refueled in just over three minutes.\nFred Frame led eleven laps at the halfway point. Frame's challenge at the front of the field was short-lived, and he eventually fell back and finished 10th. Louis Meyer took the lead once again on lap 109, and led until lap 157. With Meyer leading, Keech second, and Kleopfer (driving for Moore) third, car numbers #1, #2, and #3 were running 1st-2nd-3rd.\nLouis Meyer came to the pits on lap 157, but had a disastrous seven-minute pit stop. The engine stalled and the crew worked diligently on the carburetor to get him back out on the track. By the time he got back in the race, he had fallen to third place. Ray Keech was now firmly in control with Kleopfer (driving for Moore) in second.\nFinish.\nIn the closing laps, Ray Keech led Barney Kleopfer (driving for Lou Moore). Louis Meyer was charging hard in third place, desperate to make up for lost time in the pits. The Kleopfer car was running low on oil, and sputtering. Keech held a lead of about 1 minute and 14 seconds with ten laps to go. Third place was another 4 minutes behind. The rest of the field was many laps down.\nWhile Keech cruised to victory, the race now came down to who was going to finish second. Barney Kleopfer pulled Lou Moore's car into the pits with two laps to go. The engine was clanking, suffering from burned out bearings. Lou Moore got back in the car, attempting to nurse the final two laps out of the machine. Still holding a lead of at least a few minutes over third place, he was able to crank the car one more time, and pulled away. He only got as far as turn two, and the engine threw a rod down the backstretch. Due to the rules at the time, all cars that were running at the finish were ranked ahead of cars that dropped out, regardless of total lap count. Since Moore was not running at the finish, he was scored behind all finishers. He fell all the way back to 13th position, behind three cars that actually had fewer laps than he had. But more frustrating for Moore was the loss of over $12,000 in prize money. His lap prize money $2,200 and 13th place purse of $462 was of little consolation.\nRay Keech took home a purse of $31,350 for the victory. A hard-charging Louis Meyer snatched second place after the Moore car's misfortunes. Meyer finished 6 minutes and 24 second behind, and collected $20,400.\nJimmy Gleason finished third, nursing a sore ankle from an injury the previous fall. After suffering a crash in practice just before time trials, Carl Marchese came home fourth. After showing strength in qualifying, the only front-wheel drive car to go the distance belonged to Cliff Bergere, credited with 9th place. The final few laps were also dramatic for Billy Arnold. After suffering a cut eye early in the going, Arnold was back in the car for the finish, but ran out of gas on lap 196. One of his mechanics ran to his aid with a gas can, and Arnold was able to finish. The delay, however, cost Arnold two positions, and he dropped from 6th to 8th in the final standings.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nThe race was carried live on radio on WKBF-AM, in a partnership arranged with the \"Indianapolis News\". The broadcast began at 9:30 a.m. local time, and was five and a half hours in duration. It was the fifth consecutive year the race was being carried on the radio through this format. WFBM also picked up the broadcast.\nThe broadcast originated from the Pagoda, with microphones also set up in the pit area. The booth announcing staff included Chris Albion and John H. Heiney. John Mannix and a crew of four assistants handled the pit duties, and William F. Sturm was on hand to offer race summaries.\nAt 2 p.m., NBC came on air for live national coverage of the final hour of the race. Anchor Graham McNamee's call was picked up on WKBF and 47 other NBC affiliates across the country.\nLegacy.\nRay Keech reigned as Indianapolis 500 champion for only 17 days. He would be fatally injured in a crash at Altoona Speedway on June 15, 1929. Keech joined Gaston Chevrolet and Joe Boyer (and later George Robson and Dan Wheldon) as Indy 500 winners who were killed in racing accidents the same year as their Indy victory.\nDespite the predictions of record speeds, the final race contested with the 91.5 cubic inch \"specialized\" racing machines failed to set records in either qualifying or the race. Peter DePaolo's 1924 race record (101.127 mph) would stand for another three years. The one-lap qualifying record (124.018 mph) set by Leon Duray in 1928 would also stand for nearly a decade until it fell."

        "text": "The 16th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Wednesday, May 30, 1928. This was the first Indianapolis 500 presided over by new Speedway president Eddie Rickenbacker. Rain threatened to wash out the day, but the showers stopped and the race started on time. One brief shower slowed the race around the 400-mile mark, bringing out the yellow flag for a few laps.\nIt was the third year contested with the supercharged 91 cu. in. (1.5 L) displacement engine formula. A total of seven supercharged front-wheel drive cars were entered, and they swept the front row during time trials. Leon Duray in a Miller took the pole position with an average speed of , a new track record. Duray dominated much of the first half of the race, setting a blistering pace. He dropped out in the second half, however, due to an overheating engine.\nWith twenty laps to go, Tony Gulotta led Jimmy Gleason and Louis Meyer. All three cars were running nose-to-tail. On lap 181, Gulotta slowed with a leaking fuel tank and a clogged fuel line. Gleason and Meyer then battled for the lead. On lap 196 Gleason headed for the pits to take on water for the radiator. A crew member missed the radiator and accidentally doused the car's magneto with water. The engine was ruined with a cracked water jacket in sight of victory.\nRookie driver Louis Meyer (though he had appeared as a relief driver in 1927) took the first of what would be three career Indy victories. Meyer did not even land his ride until one week before the race. Car owner Phil Shafer entered a rear-wheel drive Miller Special for Wilbur Shaw with initial backing from a fuel pump manufacturer. The deal fell through, and Shafer abruptly sold the car to Alden Sampson II four days before time trials were scheduled to begin. Sampson hired Louis Meyer to drive the car, the same machine that Tony Gulotta drove to a third place in 1927. Meyer put the car safely in the field in 13th starting position. He drove a steady, consistent pace, and led only once, the final 19 laps of the race. Despite predictions of record speed, and an early blistering pace, Meyer's average speed of 99.482 mph for the 500 miles fell short of the record set in 1926.\nRace schedule.\nThe race was scheduled for Wednesday May 30. Competitors began arriving at the grounds in mid-April, and the track was to be made available for practice and testing no later than May 1. Elimination trials were scheduled for three days (May 26–28), but qualifying extended to an additional day (and for a brief period on race morning) due to a short field. The annual awards banquet was scheduled for Thursday evening (May 31) at the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce.\nTime trials.\nQualifications was scheduled for three days, May 26–28. The minimum speed to qualify was set at 90 mph. A total of 36 entries were expected to make attempts to fill the 33 starting positions. Qualified cars on the first day of trials would line up in the grid first, followed by the second day qualifiers, and so on.\nRiding mechanics were optional, however, no teams entered utilized them.\nSaturday May 26.\nThe first day of elimination trials was held Saturday May 26. Qualifying was scheduled from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Any cars in line at 5 o'clock were permitted to make their runs, continuing until the track closed at sundown. The morning dawned dark, with the threat of rain looming, but fair skies prevailed. The existing track records going into the month were both held by Frank Lockhart. The one-lap track record (120.918 mph) and four-lap track record (120.100 mph) were both set during time trials in 1927.\nThe supercharged front-wheel drive Millers were expected to excel in qualifying, with Leon Duray the favorite for the pole position. Duray had set an unofficial track record on May 17, and was among the fastest cars all month long.\nThe first driver to challenge the track record was Cliff Woodbury in one of the Boyle Valve Specials owned by Mike Boyle. On his third lap, Woodbury's set a one-lap track record (121.081 mph). His four-lap average of 120.418 mph was also a record. It was noted that this was Woodbury's first attempt in a front-wheel drive car at the Speedway, and it garnered him a solid front row starting position. Woodbury's spot on the pole was short-lived, however. Leon Duray in the Miller Special took to the track a short time after Woodbury. Duray smashed the one-lap track record on his second lap with a speed of 123.203 mph. His four-lap average of 122.391 mph was also a new track record, and he secured the pole position.\nThe most serious incident of the afternoon involved 1925 winner Peter DePaolo. During his qualifying attempt, going into turn three on the first lap, the car went out of control, and flipped over at least three times. DePaolo was thrown from the vehicle, then the car slid upside down along the bricks, ripping off the engine cowling, shearing off the carburetor, and grinding the top of the supercharger casing. The car suffered a bent rear axle, a dented nose, and other minor damage. It was determined that the crash was caused by the steering mechanism locking up. DePaolo suffered gouges to his arms, bruised legs, and cuts on his chin. Though DePaolo escaped serious injuries, he was sidelined for the remainder of the month. After the crash, the team led by chief mechanic Collon Henning Peters began repairing the car, in hopes of still qualifying with another driver.\nAt the end of the day, the front wheel drive machines swept the front row, and five of the top eight starting positions. A total of 19 cars had qualified, leaving 14 positions open.\nSunday May 27.\nThe second day of elimination trials was held on Sunday May 27. Five cars completed runs in front of a crowd estimated at 12,000–15,000 spectators. Pete Kreis was the fastest driver of the day. The field filled to 24 cars, leaving nine spots open.\nBack in the garage area, the wrecked car of Peter DePaolo was being repaired. Bob McDonogh and Wilbur Shaw were being rumored as possible replacement drivers to the seat.\nDuring the day, a tire changing contest was held between several of the pit crews. Dick Doyle and Bud Miller, servicing the car of George Souders, won the $50 top prize.\nMonday May 28.\nThe third day of elimination trials was scheduled for Monday May 28. Although Monday was originally the final day allowed to qualify, officials announced that Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning may opened up due to prospects of a short field.\nClarence Belt made history, becoming the first driver ever to qualify a V-type engine at Indianapolis.\nTuesday May 29.\nDespite a slippery track, three drivers completed qualifying attempts. Officials decided that the deadline to qualify would be set at 12 noon. Late in the afternoon Ted Miller, the relief driver for Buddy Marr, was taking practice laps in the #35 B.W. Cooke Special. Miller crashed at the south end of the track. Miller suffered a broken arm and lacerations, and was taken to the hospital. The car was badly damaged. The crew would work into the night to try to repair the car, but ran out of time, and withdrew on race morning.\nWednesday May 30.\nTwo drivers, Wilbur Shaw and Jim Hill, received permission to qualify their cars at 5:00 a.m. on race morning. However, only Shaw took to the track. Shaw put Peter DePaolo's car in the field, a car repaired after the crash on Saturday. DePaolo was brought to the track by an ambulance, and cheered on the team lying on a stretcher trackside.\nDuring practice runs just before the race, L. L. Corum and Dutch Baumann crashed their cars. Corum crashed in turn three. Baumann lost control in turn two and wrecked, but was not injured. Both cars were too damaged to race and both cars were withdrawn before the race started.\nRace summary.\nMorning rain threatened to postpone the start of the race, scheduled for 10:00 a.m. central standard time. The first shower came through the area at 6:30 a.m., followed by another brief shower at 8:30 a.m. About fifteen minutes later, the rain stopped and the track began to dry. Changes to the starting lineup shuffled the grid Wednesday morning. With Wilbur Shaw putting the DePaolo car in the field, his car was placed at the rear of the field. Meanwhile, three cars were withdrawn on race morning due to crashes. Buddy Marr's car, wrecked on Tuesday, was not repaired in enough time and was scratched. L. L. Corum and Dutch Baumann both suffered crashes during practice runs early Wednesday morning, and both were withdrawn. Both crashes were blamed on the damp conditions. Corum was not seriously injured, and planned to drive relief for other cars during the race.\nJim Hill was unable to qualify, and there were no alternates, so the 33-car field would be short by four cars. Only 29 cars lined up in the grid to take the starter's flag.\nStart.\nThe track was still damp, but officials deemed it adequately dry for racing. The sun had come out, and the brick surface was drying quickly. With rain showers holding off, pace car driver Joe Dawson led the field around for one warm up lap. The field received the red starter's flag, and the race started on time.\nLeon Duray grabbed the lead from the pole position at the start. The first lap was run at 113.279 mph, and Duray held a four car-length lead at the conclusion of the first lap. Cliff Woodbury ran second with Cliff Bergere in third. Benny Shoaff (lap 3) made a pit stop to adjust the distributor, and Fred Comer (lap 4) was also in the pits to change a tire.\nRuss Snowberger was the first car out of the race, suffering a broken supercharger. Then, after starting in the outside of the front row, Cliff Bergere was out on lap 6 with a broken distributor shaft.\nFirst half.\nLeon Duray dominated the early stages of the race. His average speed after 20 laps (50 miles) was 107.078 mph – over a mile per hour faster than the previous year. With Bergere out, Tony Gulotta moved up to second place, Babe Stapp was in third, Louis Schneider in fourth, and Jimmy Gleason was in fifth. Cliff Woodbury was forced to make a pit stop to change spark plugs. He lost nearly three minutes, and fell two laps down.\nOn lap 35, Benny Shoaff hit an oil slick in the south end of the track and spun out. The car crashed into the outside wall, rebounded, and came to rest facing the opposite direction. Shoaff's suffered a bloody nose, but no major injuries. Shoaff headed back to the pits, and would later drive relief for Fred Frame. Wilbur Shaw, the last qualifier who put his car in the field just that morning, was never a factor. Starting last (29th) in the same car that Peter DePaolo wrecked just days earlier, he lasted only 42 laps. He was another victim of broken timing gears. Shaw returned to the pits, and stood by to drive relief.\nAt the 100 mile mark (40 laps), Duray continued to lead, with Gulotta in second. Duray and Babe Stapp traded the lead for a few laps, but soon after Duray began to fade. After leading 59 of the first 62 laps, Duray's car was beginning to suffer overheating problems and he began to slip in the standings.\nDefending race winner George Souders came to the lead on lap 63, and led for 16 laps. Souders reported that his car was difficult to handle, but he was able to run a consistent pace and stay near the front of the field. Cliff Woodbury, who started in the middle of the front row and had been plagued with mechanical problems early on, dropped out with 55 laps completed due to broken timing gears.\nOn lap 80 (200 miles) first-year starter Louis Meyer had charged up to fourth position.\nAs the race approached the halfway point, it was Jimmy Gleason (who started deep in the field), that was now the fastest car on the track. Gleason took the lead from Babe Stapp on lap 83, and set out to lead over the next 100 miles.\nA leaking gasoline line on Ray Keech's car was beginning to cause the car to lose fuel pressure. Keech handed the car over to relief driver Wilbur Shaw, but Shaw did not last very long with burns on his leg due to the leaking fuel. Keech got back in the car, and pushed on.\nSecond half.\nLeon Duray's day finally came to an end after 133 laps. The car went out with overheating trouble while Cliff Woodbury was behind the wheel. Jimmy Gleason led until a pit stop on lap 135. He handed the car over to Russ Snowberger who drove relief for the next 13 laps. Snowberger maintained the lead in Gleason's car.\nIra Hall crashed out after competing 115 laps. Lou Wilson took over as relief driver for Louis Schneider. Then Scheinder himself got behind the wheel of Lou Moore's car. Both drivers finished the remainder of the race that way.\nThe final 100 miles was set to be a three-car battle between the cars of Jimmy Gleason, Tony Gulotta, and the steady but gaining Louis Meyer. Louis Schneider, now driving Lou Moore's car, was also inching closer to the leaders.\nShortly after 2:00 p.m., when the leaders had just passed the 400-mile mark (lap 160), a light rain began to fall. Officials put out the yellow flag and the drivers were instructed to proceed with caution. Officials contemplated halting the race (as has happened two years earlier) for safety reasons, but the shower was very brief. After only a few laps under yellow, the field went back to racing. At that moment, on his 162nd lap, Earl Devore skidded coming out of the north turns due to the wet conditions and eventually crashed into the outside wall in turn one. The fuel tank was crushed, and Devore was out of the race.\nFinish.\nWith twenty laps to go, Tony Gulotta led Jimmy Gleason and Louis Meyer. A margin of only 2.04 seconds separated 1st-2nd-3rd place. On lap 181, Gulotta began slowing down and stalled in turn three. A tiny leak in the fuel tank was causing his fuel pressure to drop, and his fuel line was clogged. Gulotta's crew would need an hour-long pit stop to make repairs. Gulotta and Dutch Baumann took turns nursing the car around to 10th-place finish. Meyer took the lead on lap 182, but Gleason was in second, and was in close contention.\nOn lap 195, Gleason headed for the pits to take on water for the radiator. A crew member missed the radiator and accidentally doused the car's magneto with water. The engine was ruined with a cracked water jacket as well, and Gleason was out of the race in sight of a chance for victory. Louis Meyer cruised at a steady pace to victory, winning by a little less than one lap margin over a charging Louis Schneider (in Lou Moore's car). Meyer is credited as a being a rookie winner, since his previous experience in the 1927 race was only in a relief driver role. Meyer made only one pit stop, a routine stop for oil, fuel, and to change two tires.\nRay Keech, despite bad burns on his leg, remarkably came home fourth. All three cars of the front row dropped out, and yet again, the supercharged front-engine machines failed to achieve victory. The highest finishing front wheel drive car was Babe Stapp in 6th place.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nThe race was carried live on radio on WKBF-AM, in a partnership arranged with the \"Indianapolis News\". The broadcast began at 9:30 a.m. local time, and was about six hours in duration. It was the fourth consecutive year the race was being carried on the radio through this format. WFBM also picked up the broadcast. The broadcast originated from the Pagoda, with microphones also set up in the pit area. The booth announcing staff was led by Chris Albion. John Mannix led the pit reporting crew.\nFor the first time ever, NBC came on air for live national coverage of the final hour of the race. At approximately 2:10 p.m., anchor Graham McNamee's call was picked up on WKBF and numerous other NBC affiliates across the country."

He moved up to second on Lap 16. After the rain delay, Lockhart and Dave Lewis battled for the lead for about 20 laps, until Lewis dropped out. After Lewis retired with a broken valve, Harry Hartz closed on Lockhart and briefly took the lead at about 250 miles as the crowd roared. But soon afterward Hartz was forced to make an unscheduled pit stop. Lockhart then stretched out a two-lap lead when the race was called, and he was declared the winner. It was the first rain-shortened race in \"500\" history, and Lockhart was the fourth rookie to win the race. Lockhart may have actually completed as many as 163 laps (407.5 miles), but official scoring results reverted to the completion of lap 160.\nTime trials.\nFour-lap (10 mile) qualifying runs were utilized.

Alley and two other spectators were injured.\nMemorial Day controversy.\nIn January 1923, about four months before the race, the Indiana Legislature passed a bill prohibiting commercialized sporting events, including the Indianapolis 500, from being held on Memorial Day. Some veterans groups, and proponents of the measure, led by senator Robert L. Moorhead, were displeased with the way the holiday had become \"...a day for games, races, and revelry, instead of a day of memory and tears\". The bill sparked a heated debate, whereby the local American Legion issued a public proclamation opposing the law, on the grounds of free expression, and being \"un-American\" in principle.\nThe issue created a potential schedule shake-up, which could have moved the race to the proceeding Saturday (May 26), or forced an outright cancellation. Speedway management was leery about permanently moving the race to a Saturday, since many spectators worked on Saturdays, and they preferred to have the race on a holiday. Officials in the city of Indianapolis even proposed making the Saturday before Memorial Day a city holiday, to ensure the race was held on a holiday. On March 5, after consulting legal experts, Governor Warren T. McCray vetoed the bill, calling it \"class legislation\" and therefore unconstitutional.\nTime trials.\nFour-lap (10 mile) qualifying runs were utilized.

        "text": "The 4th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, May 30, 1914.\nRené Thomas was the race winner, accompanied by riding mechanic Robert Laly.\nBackground.\nRace history.\nThe Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909, and the first motorsport event at the track, a series of motorcycle races, was held in August of that year. A series of automobile races were held in 1909, but concerns were raised about the condition of the course after numerous accidents, including a fatality. The track was re-paved at a high-cost to Carl G. Fisher and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation, and further series of races took place in 1910. Fisher was worried about the dwindling attendances at these races, and decided to establish a 500-mile race; double the furthest distance of any previous race at the track. He went on to announce that the track would host no other races during the year, and that the prize for first place would be $25,000: more than 10 times higher than any other race. The total prize-fund was $85,000. Fisher's plans paid off, and at the 1911 Indianapolis 500, the inaugural event, newspapers reported that in excess of 80,000 people attended the race. Each of the first two races were won by Americans; Ray Harroun in 1911 and Joe Dawson in 1912. In 1913, the large prize-fund attracted European teams and racers, and the race was won by Jules Goux in a Peugeot.\nRule changes.\nDuring the 1913 race, Jules Goux and his riding mechanic had drunk pints of champagne, during each of his pit stops. For 1914, the consumption of alcohol during the race was banned. Riding mechanics were mandatory for the 1914 race. The maximum engine size remained unchanged at of engine displacement.\nReport.\nElimination trials.\nThere were 45 entrants for the race, but only the quickest 30 drivers during the elimination trials would qualify for the race. The first day of trials was completed on the Monday before the race, 25 May. Caleb Bragg set the fastest official time on the first day, recording 1:36.8, though it was reckoned that Howdy Wilcox went quicker, but his time was not officially recorded. Ralph DePalma, a crowd favourite, struggled in his Mercedes and could only manage a quickest time of 1:47.4, slower than the 1:45 that it was predicted drivers would have to beat in order to qualify. Only fifteen of the drivers ran on the first day, and they continued with two sessions on the Tuesday. On the second day, three drivers set record times around the Speedway: first the 1912 winner, Joe Dawson, set an unofficial lap time of 1:34.8. Later in the day Teddy Tetzlaff completed a lap in 1:33.4, while Jules Goux finished the day as the fastest driver, with a time of 1:31.7. Tetzlaff's lap was completed in a Maxwell which was fuelled with a 50:50 mix of gasoline and kerosene; the other Maxwell, driven by Billy Carlson, set a time of 1:36.6 fuelled by a combination of kerosene and lucubrating oil, with no gasoline. Ray Harroun, who had won the inaugural Indianapolis 500 in 1911, designed the Maxwell car, and was given $10,000 () by the company's president as a reward for the cars qualifying with sub-1:37 times.\nBy the end of the second day, 21 drivers had completed speed trials, and all but DePalma and Eddie Pullen had times below 1:45. Hughie Hughes's car suffered a broken crank case, preventing him from being able to set a qualifying time. On the final day of the trials, DePalma managed to make significant improvements in his Mercedes, and qualified with the twentieth fastest time overall, in 1:42.12. Georges Boillot set the overall fastest time, edging out his teammate Goux by completing a lap in 1:30.13, exceeding along the straights. The slowest of the thirty qualifiers was Harry Grant in a Sunbeam, with a lap time of 1:44.09.\nBuild up.\nAfter the rigours of the elimination trials, DePalma withdrew from the race, claiming that his car had been vibrating so heavily that his engine would not survive the race. His place was taken by Ray Gilhooley in the Italian-built Isotta car. Gilhooley was known as a fearless, and sometimes erratic, driver who was feared by his peers, as they considered him unpredictable. DePalma claimed that he had twice seen Gilhooley \"tear through a wooden fence at full tilt\" on occasions when Gilhooley risked overtakes on dangerous corners. The bookmakers made the 1913 race winner, Goux, the favourite, followed by his Peugeot teammate Boillot. Although the Frenchmen were accepted to be driving the quickest cars, there was some belief in the American press that their English tires might not be as durable as American tires, which could improve the chances of the American drivers.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie"

        "text": "The Third International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday, May 30, 1913. Frenchman Jules Goux became the first foreign-born, and first European winner of the Indianapolis 500. His margin of victory of 13 minutes, 8 seconds (approximately 7 laps) over second place Spencer Wishart still stands, as of 2023, as the largest margin of victory in Indianapolis 500 history.\nRace Summary.\nAfter the entries in the first two years of the Indianapolis 500 had been almost exclusively American, 1913 saw six drivers travel to the United States from Europe to enter, likely attracted by the impressive $20,000 first prize (). A total of 27 cars would meet the 75 mile per hour qualifying speed, led by Jack Tower at 88.230 mph. The starting grid was determined by a random draw of names, and Caleb Bragg would be given the pole.\nTower's car turned over on the southwest turn on lap 51, causing him to sustain a broken leg and his riding mechanic, Lee Dunning, to break three ribs. Bob Burman started the race as the favorite, and led 41 laps early, before his car caught fire on lap 55. Burman was able to repair his car and continue, however continuing problems led to several more stops and a replacement driver, who brought the car home in eleventh (unfortunately only the top ten finishers received prize money).\nFrench-born Jules Goux, driving a car owned and manufactured by Peugeot (where his father was the factory Supervisor) would lead the race on four occasions. Bob Evans dueled with Goux, leading laps 125–135, but would be forced out of the race on lap 158 due to a mechanical problem. Goux would dominate the remainder of the race, leading 138 laps en route to a victory of a more than 13 minute margin, making him the first non-American winner of the 500. The car contained a four-cylinder dual overhead camshaft engine, which would serve as a model for many future entries. Goux would state after the race that his manager forced him stay below the car's top speed, feeling the lead was safe. Spencer Wishart was the top finishing American in second, while two of the other European cars would finish fourth and fifth.\nRules at the time required the top ten drivers to finish the full 500 miles to receive prize money. This led to an interesting sight for spectators who remained after Goux's finish. Charlie Merz, in contention for second place, would have his car catch fire towards the end of lap 199. Merz, not wishing to surrender the prize money, drove the final lap on fire, while Harry Martin, his riding mechanic, crawled out on top of the hood of the still moving car to beat at the flames and release the straps the held the engine cover to allow the fire to be extinguished faster. Merz finished third. Martin would unfortunately be killed while helping test a car on the speedway less than two months later.\nChampagne.\nUrban legends claim that race winner Jules Goux consumed \"six bottles of champagne\" en route to victory. However, that claim is believed to be exaggerated. Instead, during Goux's six pit stops, only four bottles (each pint) were shared between himself and his riding mechanic Emil Begin, with each taking some sips, but likely not enough to become intoxicated. Other swigs were spit out using the champagne as a mouthwash. It was a hot day, and given the punishing conditions, during his first pit stop Goux was quoted as saying \"Rustle me a pint of wine or I'll blow\" After the race, in victory lane, Goux stated \"The heat was terrible. I suffered and but for the wine, I should have been unable to drive this race.\" In subsequent years, AAA officials banned the consumption of alcohol during competition.\nStarting grid.\nEntries were required to complete one lap in excess of 75 mph in order to qualify. However, starting positions were determined by blind draw held the night preceding the race.\nBox score.\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nNote: Several sources claim Zuccarelli's entry to have carried the numerical designation #15. Photographs taken of entries qualified for the 1913 race, however, exhibit #45 prominently displayed on the Peugeot's front-facing engine grill."

        "text": "The 64th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 25, 1980. Johnny Rutherford won the pole position, led 118 laps, and won the race by a commanding 29.92 second margin. After failing to finish the race the year before (with Al Unser behind the wheel), Jim Hall's radical new Chaparral 2K ground effects chassis was a heavy favorite entering the month, and drove a flawless race. Rutherford, the winner in 1974 and 1976, became the sixth driver to win the Indy 500 three times.\nTom Sneva broke an Indy 500 record by becoming the first driver to start last (33rd) and lead the race. Sneva led two times for 16 laps, and finished the race in second position. Sneva likewise became the first driver in Indy history to start last and finish second (a feat tied by Scott Goodyear in 1992). It was Sneva's third runner-up finish in four years, matching Bill Holland's achievement exactly 30 years earlier in 1947, 1948 and 1950. Sneva's efforts were often branded afterwards with a \"bridesmaid\" reference, until he would finally go on to win the race in 1983.\nThe starting lineup featured 10 rookies, a sharp contrast from 1979, which had only one.\nFor the first time in Indy history, the three drivers that started in the eleventh and final row finished in the top eight — Tom Sneva 2nd, Gary Bettenhausen 3rd, and Tom Bigelow 8th.\nBackground.\nAfter the tumultuous and controversial month of May at Indy in 1979, the landscape of Indy car racing was starting to settle into a more civilized fashion. During the offseason, USAC published their 1980 schedule, which featured such races as the Indianapolis 500, Texas World Speedway, Talladega, and Charlotte. Meanwhile, CART released their own schedule. Before the season began, the leaders of USAC and CART jointly formed the new Championship Racing League (CRL) to co-sanction the season of events. Several of the USAC-planned events were scrapped, including Talladega, Charlotte, Mosport, and Road Atlanta, and the two schedules were instead merged.\nA major change for 1980 designated the Indianapolis 500 now as an \"Invitational\" event, rather than an \"Open\" type event. This was done, in part, to prevent the uproar of denied entries as happened in 1979. Originally the plan was to grant automatic invitations to the teams that competed in all three 500-mile \"Triple Crown\" races in 1979 (Indianapolis, Pocono, and Ontario). However, that plan was scuttled when only one car (Danny Ongais) fulfilled those conditions, and furthermore when Ontario switched alliances to the CART series. In January 1980, the criteria for receiving an invitation to the Indianapolis 500 was announced, and essentially included any certified team in USAC or CART that was judged to have a realistic intent of making a qualifying attempt. Brand new teams were subject to review, and required written documentation of the operational plans. In general, the new invitational rules would exclude few, if any, teams in Indy car racing, whether they were part of the USAC Trail or the CART series.\nThe 1980 CART PPG Indy Car World Series began in April, and Indianapolis was the second race of the season. CART awarded points for Indianapolis towards their championship. After Indianapolis, Speedway officials became unhappy with the CRL arrangement. In the middle of July, after a total of five races had been run, USAC would pull out of the CRL.\nRule changes.\nGoing into the month USAC dropped turbocharger \"boost\" levels to 48 inHG across the board. Previously the levels were 50 inHG, and before that 80 inHG. The rule change slowed cars down by as much as , and drew the ire of many competitors. Outspoken critics included A. J. Foyt who referred to it as \"taxicab racing,\" and Johnny Rutherford who said it made it difficult to pass other cars.\nTime trials.\nPole Day – Saturday May 10.\nThe first day of time trials opened with cloudy skies and temperatures in the low 70s (°F). Scattered rain showers were in the forecast. The favorites for the pole included Mario Andretti, Johnny Rutherford, and rookie Tim Richmond. A. J. Foyt was also a dark horse for the front row. Richmond had set the fastest lap of the month () in practice, but a crash on pole day morning sidelined him for the weekend.\nDefending champion and defending pole winner Rick Mears was the first driver out to qualify at 11:00 a.m., and he set the early pace at . An hour later, Spike Gehlhausen () knocked Mears off the top spot. At 12:45 p.m., Mario Andretti took over the provisional pole with a speed of .\nA short rain shower closed the track for 20 minutes.\nAt 2:08 p.m., Johnny Rutherford in the Jim Hall Chaparral 2K chassis (nicknamed the \"Yellow Submarine\" due to its bright yellow Pennzoil paint job) took to the track. Rutherford secured the pole position with a four-lap average speed of .\nThe next car out was Bobby Unser, who squeezed on to the front row with a speed of . A. J. Foyt, took to the track twice – the first attempt he waved off before taking the green flag, and the second attempt was aborted due to a rain shower. After a rain and hail delay of over an hour and a half, Foyt got one last chance to qualify. His speed of was good enough only for 12th starting position.\nAt the end of the first day of time trials, the field was filled to 16 cars.\nSecond Day – Sunday May 11.\nThree cars completed runs, with Danny Ongais () the fastest of the afternoon. Gordon Johncock, who broke his ankle in a practice crash on Thursday, got in a back-up car to qualify for 18th starting position.\nThird Day – Saturday May 17.\nThe third day of time trials was rained out. With a starting spot at Indy secured for the middle of the front row, Mario Andretti flew to Monte Carlo for the Monaco Grand Prix. Andretti would finish 3 laps down in 7th, then would return to Indy on Carburetion Day.\nTom Sneva, who had qualified 14th, wrecked his primary car during the second week of practice. His team obtained a back-up car, and Sneva arranged to drive that car in the race. According to the rules, Sneva would move to the rear of the field, and start the race in last (33rd) position.\nBump Day – Sunday May 18.\nThe final day of time trials opened with 14 spots open. There were roughly 38 cars in the garage area prepared to qualify, and the day was expected to be busy and hectic.\nNon-stop qualifying took place when the track opened at noon. The field was filled to 33 cars by 2:40 p.m. Rookie Tim Richmond was the fastest of the day at , the 5th-fastest car overall in the field. Tony Bettenhausen Jr. () was the first driver on the bubble.\nThe bumping began with John Martin bumping out Bettenhausen. In total, seven drivers were bumped by 4 p.m. Eventually, Martin was bumped himself.\nWith weather starting to enter the area at 4 o'clock, time was running out for qualifying. Gary Bettenhausen (Tony's brother) was now on the bubble. Bettenhausen survived three attempts over the next 15 minutes. At 4:20 p.m., Ron Shuman was lined up to make an attempt, but rain began to fall before he pulled away. Bettenhausen held on to make the field, and the track was closed for the day.\nCarburetion Day – Thursday May 22.\nThe final practice session before race day saw Mario Andretti set the best lap at . Tom Bagley spun and crashed in turn 3, but he was uninjured. Bill Vukovich blew his engine. A total of 31 of the 33 qualified cars took laps.\nLater on, Tom Bigelow's AMI Racing/Sherman Armstrong team won the Miller Pit Stop Contest.\nTragedy struck in the infield during the session. Timothy Scott Vail, 19, of Indianapolis, was killed in the infield when his jeep overturned in the notorious \"Snake Pit\" area of the turn 1 infield. He suffered a fractured skull.\nRace summary.\nPre-race.\nMary F. Hulman gave the command to start engines shortly before 11:00 a.m. With Janet Guthrie failing to qualify, the command reverted to the traditional \"Gentlemen, start your engines!\" for the first time since 1976.\nWhile sitting on the starting grid, polesitter Johnny Rutherford claims that a lady bug landed on his uniform — and considered it a fortuitous good luck omen.\nFirst half.\nAt the start, polesitter Johnny Rutherford and Bobby Unser went into turn one side-by-side, with Rutherford taking the lead. Mario Andretti settled into third. Larry \"Boom Boom\" Cannon and Mike Mosley were both out with engine problems in the first 5 laps.\nThe first of several cautions came out on lap 4, for a tow-in for Cannon. On lap 9, the yellow was out again for a crash between Bill Whittington and Dick Ferguson. Ferguson hit the inside wall in the southchute hard, sustaining a broken toe. Whittington needed assistance out of his car and suffered a broken right leg. The race was restarted, and after only one lap of green, Spike Gehlhausen crashed in turn 1.\nDuring the sequence of pit stops and yellows, the lead changed hands several times in the first 60 laps. Rookie Tim Richmond led lap 73, then on lap 74, Tom Sneva set an Indy 500 record by leading the race after starting last (33rd). Sneva led the next 11 laps.\nAfter leading 10 laps during the race, and being in contention, Mario Andretti dropped out with engine trouble.\nSecond half.\nAt the halfway point, 20 cars were still running. Bobby Unser led at the halfway point. Johnny Rutherford, Rick Mears, and Tom Sneva were all in the top five.\nBobby Unser dropped out with turbo failure after 126 laps. Jerry Sneva crashed in turn one on lap 132 while two laps down, suffering a bruised knee. With Unser out, Johnny Rutherford dominated most of the second half, but Tom Sneva and Rick Mears both managed to lead laps, and were far from out-of-contention.\nOn lap 172, Rick Mears took the lead, with Sneva second, Rutherford third. One final scheduled pit stop remained for the leaders. Rutherford was the first to pit, under green. A. J. Foyt brought out the yellow on lap 177 for stalling in turn 3. Mears held a 20-second lead. Tom Sneva ducked into the pits under the yellow for tires and fuel. One lap later, leader Mears was in the pits. Mears gambled with track position, and took on only fuel. Still under the yellow, Johnny Rutherford assumed the lead, and Mears' strategy failed and he dropped to third.\nFinish.\nIn the final 20 laps, Johnny Rutherford held a comfortable lead over Tom Sneva, and was pulling away at will. Third place was now being dueled out between Gary Bettenhausen and Gordon Johncock. In the final stages, Rick Mears ducked into the pits for an unscheduled stop to change a punctured tire, which dropped him from contention.\nWith Rutherford cruising to a certain victory, and second-place Sneva also unchallenged, the attention began to focus on the battle for third place. Gordon Johncock was tucked right behind Gary Bettenhausen. Danny Ongais (7th place) was right with them, albeit a lap down. On the final lap, Bettenhausen held a car-length advantage as they approached turn 4. Suddenly, Ongais smacked the outside wall exiting turn four. Johncock attempted a slingshot pass at the line, but Bettenhausen held him off for third place by 0.27 seconds.\nRutherford won his third Indy 500 by a margin of 29.92 seconds over Tom Sneva. Sneva was lauded for charging from last starting position (33rd) to a second-place finish. He became the first driver in Indy history to do so. He missed, by 29 seconds, becoming the first driver in history to win the Indy 500 after starting dead last. Sneva was disappointed by the defeat stating: \"The car was good but it looks like no matter how good I am or how good the car is, I will always just be finishing second.\"\nAs Rutherford was pulling into the pits off his victory lap, rookie Tim Richmond ran out of fuel and stopped at the head of the mainstretch. Richmond, the future NASCAR star and \"hot shot\" personality on the circuit, led one lap during the race, was credited with 9th place, and won the rookie of the year. Rutherford stopped next to Richmond's car, and signaled for Richmond to hop on board and ride back to the pits. With much applause from the crowd, Richmond rode in on the sidepod of the winner's machine and the two exchanged congratulatory waves and handshakes.\nThe race was slowed by a then-record 13 cautions for 65 laps - race records that would stand until 1988 and 1992, respectively.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\n‡ Pancho Carter was penalized one lap for passing the pace car under yellow on lap 58. At the end of the race, Carter was running approximately 20 seconds behind Rutherford; the penalty reduced his standing from 2nd to 6th. Carter's team protested the ruling, claiming he was waved past the pace car, but USAC upheld the penalty.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as anchor for the fourth year. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. Rodger Ward, who previously served as a commentator for ABC Sports, joined the crew as \"Driver Expert.\" It was the first time that a former winner served as the expert. This was the last year of Bob Jenkins on the Backstretch. This would be the final year for Darl Wibel on the crew.\nThe reporting location for turn one was located atop the Southwest Vista grandstand, whereas in other years it was normally in the upper deck of the E Stand.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. For the first time, the broadcast was expanded to three-hours. Chris Schenkel rode along and reported live from inside one of the pace cars at the start of the race. Sam Posey returned to serve as reporter after missing the 1979 race.\nThe broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic since May 2011."

        "title": "1981 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 65th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday, May 24, 1981. The race is widely considered one of the most controversial races in Indy history. Bobby Unser took the checkered flag as the winner, with Mario Andretti finishing second. After the conclusion of the race, USAC officials ruled that Unser had passed cars illegally while exiting the pit area during a caution on lap 149 (of 200). Unser was subsequently issued a one-position penalty. The next morning, the official race results were posted, and Unser was dropped to second place. Andretti was elevated to first place and declared the race winner.\nControversy followed the ruling. After a lengthy protest and appeals process, the penalty was rescinded, and Unser was reinstated the victory on October 8. Officially, it became Unser's third-career Indy 500 victory and his final win in Indy car competition. Unser stepped out of the car at the end of the season, and ultimately retired from driving. The race was officially part of the 1981–82 USAC season; however, most of the top entrants participated in the 1981 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. Championship points for the 1981 Indy 500 were not awarded towards the CART title and the race was considered a non-championship race for that series.\nThe hectic month of May 1981 was interrupted several times by rain. Pole qualifying stretched over three days due to inclement weather, and several days of practice were cut short or lost due to rain. The 1981 race is also remembered for the horrifying crash of Danny Ongais, and a major pit fire involving Rick Mears. Ongais was critically injured, and Mears suffered burns, but both drivers would recover. A massive pit fire occurred later in the season at the Michigan 500, along with additional incidents, prompting new rules and standards to be put in place regarding the safety of fueling rigs.\nBackground.\nThree years into the first open wheel \"Split\", the sport of Indy car racing began settling into a more stabilized environment by 1981. A joint-sanctioning agreement known as the Championship Racing League (CRL) dissolved in mid-1980. USAC and CART went their separate ways, and actually awarded separate national championship titles that season. Johnny Rutherford happened to win both. Beginning in 1981, the Indianapolis 500 remained sanctioned by USAC, while the preeminent national championship was now the one being sanctioned by CART. The Indy 500 field would consist of the CART-based teams, along with numerous independent, \"Indy-only\" teams, some of which were USAC-loyal holdovers. Indianapolis was designated an \"invitational\" race, and for 1981–1982, did not pay championship points to CART title. USAC kept alive their own Gold Crown championship, running Indy, the Pocono 500, and a few dirt races. \nA record total of 105 entries were expected to shatter the previous records for drivers on the track and qualifying attempts. Speed-cutting measures were still in place, and no drivers were expected to challenge the track records in 1981. The biggest rule change by USAC during the offseason was the banning of ground effects side skirts on the sidepods.\nMario Andretti, as he had done in previous years, planned to race at Indianapolis in-between his busy, full-time Formula One schedule. His plans included qualifying at Indy on pole day weekend (May 9–10), then flying to Europe for the Belgian Grand Prix (May 17). After Belgium, he would fly back to Indianapolis in time for race day (May 24).\nIn response to a spectator fatality in the infield in 1980 (the result of an overturned Jeep), track management decided to take deliberate steps to curtail the revelry in the infamous \"Snake Pit\". For the 1981 race, bleachers were erected in the turn one infield. Over the next few years, additional capital improvements further scaled back the size of the area, and eventually the intensity of the rowdiness dropped substantially.\nRace schedule.\nFor the first time, USAC held a special test session for first-time drivers. The first-ever Rookie Orientation Program was organized and held over three days in early April. It allowed newcomers the opportunity to take their first laps at the Speedway and acclimate themselves to the circuit in a relaxed environment. It would be held without the pressure of veteran drivers crowding the track, without the distraction of spectators, and with minimal media coverage. The drivers were allowed to take the first phases of their rookie test during the ROP. They would then return to complete the final phase of the test during official practice in May.\nSince the 500 had been moved to the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, the 1981 race marked the earliest date (May 24) on which the race had ever been held. According to the calendar, May 24 is also the earliest date in which it can be scheduled.\nPractice and qualifying.\nPractice – week 1.\nPractice started on Opening Day, Saturday May 2. The two most notable rookies of the field made most of the headlines for the afternoon. Young Josele Garza (actually 19 at the time, lied on his entry form to say he was 21) and Geoff Brabham both passed their rookie tests.\nOn Sunday May 3, Al Unser became the first driver to practice over . A day later, his brother Bobby Unser pushed the speeds over . The first incidents of the month occurred Monday, when Gordon Smiley spun, and Pete Halsmer crashed in turn 4.\nTuesday (May 5) was completely rained out, and Wednesday (May 6) was windy, keeping the speeds mostly down. A record 50 cars took to the track on Thursday (May 7), with Mario Andretti fastest of the day at .\nOn Friday, the final day of practice before pole day, Penske teammates Bobby Unser and Rick Mears were hand-timed just a tick below . Mario Andretti was a close third over .\nTime trials – weekend 1.\nOn Saturday May 9, rain delayed the start of pole position time trials until 3:34 p.m. An abbreviated session saw only 9 cars finish qualifying runs. A. J. Foyt was the fastest of the nine, sitting on the provisional pole at . Rain stopped qualifying for the day at 5:49 p.m., and pushed pole qualifying into the next day.\nOn Sunday May 10, pole position qualifying was scheduled to resume. Rain fell all afternoon, however, and canceled all track activity for the day. 27 cars were still eligible for the pole position, and the resumption of pole day qualifying was scheduled for the following Saturday.\nAmong the cars not yet qualified was Mario Andretti, who was due to be in Belgium for the Grand Prix the following weekend. His plans to put the car safely in the field on pole weekend were thwarted, and a contingency plan would have to be made.\nPractice – week 2.\nRain continued to fall, and washed out practice on Monday (May 11). On Tuesday May 12, the barrier was finally broken in practice for the month by Danny Ongais. Mario Andretti took his final practice run of the week, and departed for Belgium. Two major crashes occurred, involving Phil Caliva and Phil Krueger. Tim Richmond and Larry \"Boom Boom\" Cannon both were involved in spins, but suffered no contact.\nOn Wednesday May 13, Rick Mears pushed the fastest speed of the month to . Retired veteran driver Wally Dallenbach climbed into Mario Andretti's car, and began to take some shake down laps. Due to Andretti's absence for the rest of the week, the Patrick Racing team decided to have Dallenbach qualify the car for him. On race day, Andretti would take over the cockpit once again. Dallenbach was quickly up to speed, over on his first day.\nRain closed the track on Thursday. On Friday, Bobby Unser upped the speed even further, turning a lap of . A record 63 cars took to the track on the final full day of practice. World of Outlaws star, and Indy rookie Steve Kinser crashed in turn 1.\nTime trials – weekend 2.\nPole day time trials resumed on a sunny Saturday May 16. About a half-hour into the session, Bobby Unser took over the pole position with a four-lap average of . Meanwhile, Wally Dallenbach put Mario Andretti's car safely in the field at over . Mike Mosley squeezed himself into the front row posting a run. Moments later, Rick Mears took to the track. After a lap over , his car developed a vibration, and he was forced to wave off, giving up his chance for the pole position. Pole qualifying continued until 2:00 p.m., when the original qualifying line was finally exhausted. Bobby Unser was awarded the pole, and the next round of qualifying began.\nAfter pole qualifying was over, Tom Sneva qualified his car at . It was the fastest speed of the month, but since it did not take place in the pole round, he was not eligible for the pole position. Later in the day, Rick Mears took a back-up car out to qualify, but had to settle for a slower speed, and 22nd starting position. A very busy day saw the field filled at 5:00 pm and two drivers being bumped. A total of 53 qualifying attempts were made on Saturday, breaking the previous single day record of 45.\nOn Sunday, bump day time trials were very busy. Ten cars were bumped during 25 attempts. The last complete attempt saw Jerry Sneva bump Jerry Karl. However, after being tipped off by another driver, Karl protested and Jerry Sneva was disqualified for using too much boost during his qualification attempt. It marked the first time since 1934 that the venerable Offenhauser engine did not make the race.\nCarburetion Day.\nOn Thursday May 21, the final scheduled practice session was held. All 33 qualified cars, along with 2 alternates, took laps. Mario Andretti returned from Belgium, and practiced in his already-qualified car. Jerry Karl was arrested during the week, but would be released on bond in time for race day. Bob Harkey practiced his car for him.\nThe starting grid was altered slightly after qualifying. Wally Dallenbach, who qualified Mario Andretti's car 8th, stepped aside as planned, and the car moved to the rear of the grid. In addition, George Snider vacated his ride in favor of Tim Richmond.\nBobby Unser continued his dominance of the month, and led the speed chart for the afternoon, with a hand-timed lap of . Later in the afternoon, hoping to sweep the month, his Penske Racing pit crew also guided him to a victory in the Miller Pit Stop Contest.\nRace recap.\nStart.\nThe field accelerated as it came through turn 4, anticipating the green flag. To the shock of many drivers in the back of the field, the green flag wasn't waved until Bobby Unser crossed the start-finish line, and many of the back-row markers did not see the green flag until the front-runners accelerated away through turn 1.\nBobby Unser took the lead into turn 1, and pulled away from the field, with Johnny Rutherford moving up from row 2 into second place. Mike Mosley, who started 2nd, blew a radiator on lap 16 and finished in last place. Tom Sneva, with the fastest car in the field, charged from the 20th starting position to third place by lap 20. Unser pitted on lap 22 and Rutherford took the lead, only to go out three laps later with a broken fuel pump. Sneva led for a lap, then pitted under the yellow flag for Rutherford's tow-in. Unser made a second pit stop on lap 32 when Don Whittington's accident brought out another yellow, which was extended when Gary Bettenhausen's car stopped on the backstretch. Sneva inherited the lead ahead of Gordon Smiley and Rick Mears, with Bobby Unser fourth.\nOn lap 39, the field anticipated the green flag and started accelerating between turns 3 and 4. Just then, USAC changed their minds and ordered the pace car to stay on the track. By then, Tom Sneva had accelerated through turn 4 and passed the pace car. Realizing his mistake, Sneva slowed down and blended back behind the pace car, although two more cars passed it before also slowing down. Deciding that it was the result of their own mistake, USAC decided not to impose any penalties for the potential infraction. Sneva held the lead until the second round of pit stops began on lap 56. Sneva pitted first, but the car stalled as he tried to pull away. As Sneva's crew tried to re-fire the engine, new leader Rick Mears pulled into his pit directly behind Sneva.\nMears pit fire.\nWhen Rick Mears pitted on lap 58, fuel began to gush from the refueling hose before it had been properly connected to the car. Fuel sprayed out over the car, into the cockpit onto Mears, and splashed onto some of the mechanics. It then ignited when it contacted the engine or the exhaust. Methanol burns with a transparent flame and no smoke, and panic gripped the pit as crew members and spectators fled from the invisible fire. Mears, on fire from the waist up, jumped out of his car and ran to the pit wall, where a safety worker, not seeing the fire, tried to remove Mears' helmet. Meanwhile, Mears' fueler, covered in burning fuel, waved his arms frantically to attract the attention of the fire crews already converging on the scene. By this time the safety worker attending to Mears had fled, and Mears, in near panic at being unable to breathe, leaped over the pit wall toward another crewman carrying a fire extinguisher, who dropped the extinguisher and also fled. Mears tried to turn the extinguisher on himself, but at this point his father, Bill Mears, having already pulled Rick's wife Dina to safety, grabbed the extinguisher and put out the fire. His mechanics had also been extinguished, and the fire crew arrived to thoroughly douse Mears' car.\nThanks to quick action by Bill Mears and the fact that methanol produces less heat than gasoline, no one was seriously hurt in the incident. Rick Mears and four of his mechanics (including Derrick Walker, a future crew chief on the Penske team) were sent to the hospital, and Mears underwent plastic surgery on his face, particularly on his nose which caused him to miss the next race at Milwaukee the following week. The incident prompted a redesign to the fuel nozzle used on Indy cars, adding a safety valve that would only open when the nozzle was connected to the car. The pitside tanks were also modified to add a \"dead man's valve\", and were henceforth required to be anchored to the ground. Previously some teams would prop up the giant tanks (sometimes precariously) to angle them in order to increase the head pressure and speed up the fuel flow. Additional safety measures would follow, including requiring all participants in the pits (not just over-the-wall crew) to wear fire resistant uniforms, and for the fueler to wear a helmet.\nLater in the race, Bobby Unser also reported suffering a small fire during one of his pit stops. But he was able to extinguish the flames by pulling away. The 180-mph wind from racing down the backstretch fanned out the flames, but not before his uniform burned through on the left side.\nGordon Smiley led lap 57, his first and only lap led in his career at Indianapolis.\nDanny Ongais crash.\nDanny Ongais came into the pits on lap 63 as the leader of the race, but problems during the stop caused it to drag on for 46 seconds. After finally leaving the pits, Ongais approached a slower car at the end of the backstretch. Perhaps still upset about the long stop, he made a late pass going into turn 3. Carrying too much speed into the turn, the car drifted out into the gray area and the rear tires lost traction. Ongais tried to correct the slide by turning right, but the car hooked to the right and crashed nearly head-on into the wall in turn three. (One year later, Gordon Smiley lost control similarly at the same location, but crashed directly head-on and was killed.)\nThe front end of the car was ripped away, leaving an unconscious Ongais completely exposed in the cockpit. The car continued to slide around turn three, and came to rest point forward in the north short chute. The back of the car was on fire, and a long trail of burning oil was behind. Safety crews quickly surrounded the car and used the Jaws of Life to extricate Ongais, who suffered a concussion and badly broken feet and legs. Remarkably, Ongais made a full recovery and raced again at Indianapolis just one year later.\nThe caution stayed out for 15 laps to clean up the incident. Safety workers also tended to some spectators who were hit by debris outside turn three. Gordon Johncock was now the leader, with Bobby Unser and Mario Andretti in close pursuit.\nUnser pit incident.\nOn lap 131, Tom Sneva, who fell 35 laps down after his engine stall on lap 58, was eliminated when his engine failed. He stopped his car in the infield grass of turn 1 and climbed out. Sneva, after having the fastest car, was frustratedly out of the race with a blown engine. In an interview with Chris Economaki minutes later, Sneva said that the engine stall happened because he couldn't get the car in gear and once the problem was fixed the engine began to have problems and finally came apart on Sneva's 96th lap.\nPete Halsmer crashed out of the race on lap 135 and the caution waved again soon afterwards for Josele Garza's accident. He was uninjured. Despite crashing, Josele Garza's effort in the race won him the 1981 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award. After three laps of caution, the race resumed with Mario Andretti as the race leader and Bobby Unser in second.\nOn lap 146, Tony Bettenhausen Jr. had a tire going down, which he at the time was unaware of. Approaching turn four, the tire deflated, and Bettenhausen attempted to move out of the groove and out of traffic. In the process, he touched wheels with Gordon Smiley, sending Smiley's car spinning and into the wall backwards in turn 4. Three laps later, leader Mario Andretti and second place Bobby Unser went into the pit area for service. Unser finished his pit stop first, and was the first out. Andretti followed a few seconds behind.\nWhile the two cars were exiting the pits, the pace car was leading the field at reduced speed through turns 1 and 2. Bobby Unser stayed on the track apron, below the painted white line, and proceeded to pass 14 cars. He took his place in line as the fifth car immediately behind the pace car, still the overall race leader. Mario Andretti himself also passed two cars before he blended into the field in the south short chute. Both drivers' actions went largely unnoticed at the time. Andretti claimed that he immediately called his pit crew on the radio and told him that Unser had passed cars under the yellow. A couple of the lapped cars ahead of Unser subsequently pitted, thus Unser took the green flag on the ensuing restart as the third car in line. Unser quickly dispatched of the lapped cars by turn four, and took a commanding lead into turn one.\nFinish.\nAfter Unser's controversial move under caution, the race restarted on lap 152. Bobby Unser quickly established himself as the fastest car on the track since Sneva dropped out, taking a 5-second lead on second place. However, Andretti was able to catch up to Unser in spite of losing so many positions under the yellow. Andretti made a move on a lap 166 restart, briefly taking the lead from Unser in turn 1. Unser returned the favor into turn 3, passing Andretti and quickly establishing a rapid pace. By that point, Andretti started having a tire leak, which caused him to eventually lose second place to his teammate, Gordon Johncock.\nOn lap 178, the drivers on the lead lap were Unser, Johncock, and Andretti. A yellow flag came out, which allowed Johncock and Andretti to catch a break. Pit stops were made, and Johncock emerged as the new leader. Johncock led the next three laps before he got passed by Unser. Johncock would later suffer a blown engine with 8 laps to go, handing second place to Andretti. Bobby Unser assumed the lead on lap 182, with Mario Andretti second, running over 8 seconds behind. Although Unser slowed his pace during the final two laps, he held on to win by 5.180 seconds, one of the closest finishes at Indianapolis to that point.\nBobby Unser celebrated his third Indy 500 victory (also 1968 and 1975), while Mario Andretti was lauded for charging from 32nd starting position to a 2nd place finish. Unser made a total of ten pit stops, a record for the most ever by a winner. In victory lane a satisfied Bobby Unser made no mention of a controversy about his win when interviewed by ABC's Chris Economaki. Though it was not widely noted at the time, it is believed that Unser did not partake in the traditional victory lane bottle of milk.\nControversy.\nPost race.\nShortly after the race was over, rumblings over a possible protest or penalty were beginning to surface around the garage area. Andretti's team Patrick Racing, as well as other drivers, were voicing complaints over Bobby Unser passing cars under the yellow on lap 149. Word of the incident reached chief race steward Thomas W. Binford by mid-evening. At the time, it was the policy of USAC to post official results for the Indianapolis 500 at 8 a.m. the morning after the race, and that any protest of that result could be filed after the race results were posted. In a taped interview with Chris Economaki three hours after the race ended, Binford announced that he would be reviewing the video of lap 149 with the board overnight and that based on what he saw, Unser was likely to get penalized for the passes.\nTelevision controversy.\nABC televised the race on same-day tape delay at 9 p.m. EDT. At the time, it was the policy of ABC Sports to record live booth commentary of the race at the start of the race and at the end of the race. For the remaining portions of the race, semi-scripted commentary was recorded during post-production.\nUnlike the live radio broadcast, which did not notice nor mention the infraction, the television broadcast focused heavily on the incident, and reported it as it was being aired. It was later revealed that commentators Jim McKay and Jackie Stewart had provided the lap 149 incident commentary in post-production, and did so with the knowledge that a protest of Unser's actions was in the works.\nAfter the end of the race and Unser's victory lane interview was aired on tape delay, a live segment of broadcast concluded ABC's race coverage at approximately 11:45 p.m. EDT (10:45 p.m. IST). At that late hour, Mario Andretti sat with broadcasters Jackie Stewart and Jim McKay in the broadcast booth, and announced that a protest was in process:\n\"Well, there is a protest in process, mainly because we're talking about an unusual infraction of the rules. The one particular rule we dwell on quite a bit during the private and also the public drivers are passing under yellow. This one instance where Bobby and I were exiting the pits, I was right behind him... I just lost sight. He went about 7...8...9 cars in front of me...\"\nIt was followed by the previously recorded interview with chief steward Tom Binford with Chris Economaki, with the assertion that video would be reviewed overnight, and that Unser was likely to be penalized. The overall broadcast was considered misleading, and biased against Unser, for several reasons:\nUnser took ABC's coverage, and Stewart's in particular, personally. In answer to this, Stewart said, \"Bobby was upset. He said that if it had not been for me and ABC, USAC wouldn't have had to take action. My job is not to advise officials, but it is to inform my viewers. Had I not pointed that out to illustrate an infraction of the regulations as I understood them, I would have done a great disservice to the audience.\"\nOfficial results.\nUSAC spent the night reviewing race tapes and scoring reports. At 8 a.m. EST Monday morning, the official results of the race were posted. Bobby Unser was charged with passing cars under the yellow, and was penalized \"1 position\" (some erroneous reports listed it as a 1-lap penalty) for the infraction. The penalty dropped Unser down to second place, and elevated Mario Andretti to first place. Andretti was declared the victor, and for the moment it made him a two-time Indianapolis 500 winner.\nThat night, the traditional Victory Banquet was held at the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis, with Andretti the new guest of honor. The mood was subdued, and the event was overshadowed by large-scale media attention (Bobby Unser did not attend the banquet). The winner's share of the purse was announced, but the pay envelope presented to Andretti was empty. Andretti was presented with the official pace car but was not given the keys. Ted Koppel's \"Nightline\" focused the evening's program on the controversy and included a live interview with Andretti who compared the situation to the 1978 Italian Grand Prix, a race in which he won on the track, but was stripped of victory when officials deemed he jumped the start.\nPenske Racing, Bobby Unser's team, immediately filed an official protest of the decision. On the Wednesday (18) after the race, a five-person panel of officials (led by Tom Binford), denied the protest. Roger Penske subsequently filed an appeal to the USAC Appeals Board. Bobby Unser refused to take a part willingly in the appeal stating (17):\nProtest and appeals.\nRoger Penske filed an appeal after the official results were posted which had declared Andretti the winner. A hearing was held on June 12, 1981. The USAC appeals hearing resembled a court case. According to some in attendance, witnesses who took the stand were subjected to numerous odd and superfluous questions, many with little or no relevance to the race itself. The hearings reportedly were dragged out with considerable wasted time. Mid-way through the hearing, the meeting was adjourned. While the CART-based attendees did not have a race upcoming that weekend, those in USAC had to depart, for among other reasons, to go to Pocono. The resumption of the hearing was scheduled for July 29.\nBobby Unser's primary argument was based upon the \"blend rule\", and its perceived vague definition in the rule book. When exiting the pit area during a yellow caution periods, drivers were instructed to look to their right and see which car was next to them out on the track. After accelerating to sufficient speed, the driver was to \"blend\" (merge) into the field behind that car. Mario Andretti argued that it was an established guideline that the place to look for the car to blend behind was at the south end of the pit straight, where the concrete separator wall ends. Bobby Unser countered that he understood that, as long as the car stayed under the white line and in the apron, the place to blend in was the exit of turn two. Unser argued that the warm-up apron was an extension of the pit area. Unser added that drivers were allowed to do that as long as they did not pass the pace car nor pass the car immediately behind the pace car. He also contended that Andretti had passed at least two cars himself, and should have also incurred a penalty. In addition, it was pointed out that USAC allowed the alleged infraction to go unpenalized throughout the remainder of the race (instead of acting upon it immediately after it happened). Binford, the chief steward, stated that he \"did\" receive a complaint after lap 149, but that track observers had missed Unser's infraction, so he was powerless to act during the race.\nUSAC was faced with a dilemma, as the rulebook was in fact unclear in regards to the blend rule. Officials mulled over the decision for months. On October 9, 1981, a three-member USAC appeals board voted 2-1 to reinstate the victory to Bobby Unser. He was instead fined $40,000.\nAn official of the USAC board told reporters 3 hours after the reinstatement of Unser's win:\nThe appeal panel said that, since the violation could have been detected at the time it was committed, a one-lap penalty after the completion of the race was too severe. In its decision, which resulted from a 2-to-1 vote, the panel said that race officials had \"\"a responsibility to observe and report illegal passing in yellow flag situations and they failed to do so.\"\nFollowing the ruling, Andretti, without the support of Patrick Racing, filed an appeal with a higher USAC board, arguing that he wasn't given sufficient time to argue his case against Unser. The appeal was denied by the board weeks later. After a final rejected petition to the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States, the American branch of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, Andretti did not pursue the matter any further.(48)(49)\nBox score.\nThe results below represent the final revision of the 1981 Indianapolis 500 results, certified on October 9, 1981.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nAftermath and lore.\nThe 1981 Indianapolis 500 was largely considered the most controversial running to date. It was referred to as \"The Great Dispute,\" and in some circles was \"Undecided.\" Bobby Unser, who felt the entire ordeal was politically motivated by his USAC enemies, became disillusioned with auto racing and took a sabbatical from driving. He sat out the 1982 Indy 500, and retired officially in 1983. Behind-the-scenes, the $40,000 fine for the win, other fines he faced in sponsorship, his attorney's fees, and importantly the inability to parlay his victory into valuable endorsements, ruined his finances.\nAfter being reinstated the winner, Bobby Unser was presented with the miniature Borg-Warner Trophy, while Mario Andretti had already been presented with the winner's championship ring. While Bobby Unser celebrated in victory lane on race day, the morning after the race, Mario Andretti took part in the winner's photograph session. No official victory photos were taken of Unser. Months after the race, Unser's likeness was sculpted and added to the Borg-Warner Trophy appropriately. A claim was even made at the time that Andretti \"threw away the winner's ring\" when he heard that Unser was reinstated the victory, but the story appears to have been fabricated. In a 2001 interview with Jack Arute and Bobby Unser on ESPN Classic's \"Big Ticket\", Andretti confirmed that he kept the ring by wearing it during the appearance.\nTo this day the race is still controversial. Mario Andretti has maintained that, by the rulebook, he won the race. Unser has retorted that Andretti is being a sore loser. In recent interviews, Unser said that he and Mario were very close friends until that race, and while they maintained a mutual respect, they did not speak with one another for upwards of 37 years, except in a few cases where they had no choice (like at public appearances). This also despite Unser being a broadcaster on television and radio for many years, while Andretti was still competing. They did not personally reconcile until about 2017 when Andretti phoned Unser during an illness. Unser also maintains that U.E. \"Pat\" Patrick, the car owner for Andretti in that race, was not the impetus for any protest on behalf of Andretti. Rather it was crew chief Jim McGee, and that Patrick actually felt Unser was the rightful winner. Andretti, in a 2019 interview, said that losing his friendship with Unser was more of a \"misunderstanding\", and he would have been more willing to accept the outcome, \"If Unser would have just admitted that \"Okay, I got away with one.\"” Both Unser and Andretti also agree in retrospect that regardless of the outcome, USAC mishandled the situation from start to finish and much of the controversy could have been easily avoided. Despite their differences of opinion over the controversy, Andretti would be among the first people to publicly praise Unser when Unser died in May 2021.\nAustralians Vern Schuppan (3rd), Geoff Brabham (5th) and Dennis Firestone (10th) were the first trio of foreign drivers to finish in the top ten since British drivers Graham Hill, Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart finished 1st, 2nd, and 6th in 1966. Mario Andretti was born in Italy, but was both an Italian and U.S. citizen by that time. Young rookie Josele Garza, after leading 13 laps during the race, won the Rookie of the Year award. Two years later it would be revealed that Garza fibbed about his age, and was actually 19 years old on race day (rules at the time required drivers to be at least 21 years of age). By 1983, Garza was officially being credited as the youngest starting driver ever in Indy 500 history, a record he would hold until 2003. In 1996, the rules were changed to set the minimum driver age for the Indy 500 to 18 years of age. Drivers as young as 16 years of age have won races at the Speedway on the road course (added in 2000) or dirt track (added in 2018).\nRobin Miller / A. J. Foyt controversy.\nDuring practice, a controversy erupted between \"Indianapolis Star\" journalist Robin Miller and A. J. Foyt. For the first time, handheld radar guns were being used to measure trap speeds of the race cars along the straightaways. In his May 8 column, Miller casually noted that Foyt had a trap speed measured at 214 mph on the mainstretch, about 8 mph faster than any other car. The report led some in the paddock to question the legality of Foyt's turbocharger \"boost\" setting. Foyt was angered by the report, and denied any accusations of cheating. During some downtime during Friday afternoon's practice session, Foyt hunted down Miller on the grass parapet along the pit lane, grabbed him and slapped him on the back of the head and threatened to \"remove two of [his] vital organs.\" Foyt claimed his speed was due to engine development over the winter months, and quipped 'Is it a crime to go fast?' Foyt also demanded that the radar guns be turned off.\nIn response, Miller wrote a scathing column that was published in \"The Star\" on Sunday May 10. Miller accused Foyt of throwing temper tantrums, verbal and physical intimidation, and childish behavior. But more importantly, he tallied a lengthy list of USAC races in which Foyt allegedly had cheated in the past. The column sparked controversy, and Foyt immediately refuted the allegations. Foyt demanded the paper issue a retraction, and after they refused, he filed a $3 million libel suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The suit claimed the article was false, with intent to damage Foyt's reputation, as well as create animosity towards Foyt from the other drivers. The dispute simmered during race week, and over the summer months, but was soon largely overshadowed by the Bobby Unser/Mario Andretti controversy that occurred in the race itself.\nOn November 1, 1981, \"The Star\" issued a retraction, acknowledging that Foyt's alleged unprofessional conduct \"had never been proven nor protested,\" and at the time of the retraction, \"remain[ed] unproven and unprotested.\" As a result, Foyt dropped the libel suit. The parties settled out of court for an undisclosed monetary amount, and Judge Carl O. Bue Jr. accepted the agreement and formally dismissed the suit on November 30.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as anchor for the fifth year. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. Darl Wible departed, and Bob Jenkins moved to the fourth turn position, where he would remain through 1989. Larry Henry joined the crew for the first year, stationed on the backstretch. This was Larry's only year on the Backstretch, he moved to Turn 3 the following year. This was Doug Zink's last year in Turn 3.\nThe reporting location for Turn 2 shifted slightly, although still on the roof of the VIP Suites, the station was moved southward towards the middle of the turn. Howdy Bell, the longtime turn 2 reporter, celebrated his 20th year on the crew. This was Howdy's last year in Turn 2 until 1985. In Turn 3, the reporting location moved to a platform on the L Stand.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. Sam Posey rode along and reported live from inside the pace car at the start of the race.\nThe broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic since 2003. On May 24, 2003, the race was featured on ESPN Classic's \"Big Ticket\" series, hosted by Jack Arute featuring interviews with Bobby Unser and Mario Andretti. On July 30, 2003, an expanded edit of the \"Big Ticket\" version aired.\nNotes.\nReferences.\n48. \"Racing Board Refuses To Hear Andretti's Plea\", NY Times, Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/04/sports/racing-board-refuses-to-hear-andretti-s-plea.html\n49. \"Racing Board Refuses to Hear Andretti's Plea\", NY Times, Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/04/sports/racing-board-refuses-to-hear-andretti-s-plea.html"

        "text": "The 66th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 30, 1982. Gordon Johncock, who had previously won the rain-shortened 1973 race, was the winner. Polesitter Rick Mears finished second by a margin of 0.16 seconds, the closest finish in Indy 500 history to that point.\nIn racing circles, the 1982 race is largely considered one of the best 500s in history, although it was marred by the fatal crash of Gordon Smiley during time trials. Johncock and Mears dueled over most of the final 40 laps. Johncock pulled out to a sizeable lead after his final pit stop on lap 184. But Mears dramatically began closing the gap in the waning laps. Johncock held off Mears on the final lap in a historic victory, as the raucous crowd drowned out the loud roar of the engines. The race is also remembered for a controversial crash at the start triggered by Kevin Cogan, which took out Mario Andretti, damaged the car of A. J. Foyt, and caused the crash of two other cars.\nOfficially the race was part of the 1981-82 USAC season, however, most of the entrants took part in the 1982 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. Championship points for the 1982 Indy 500 were not awarded towards the CART title and the race was considered a non-championship race in that series.\nFor the first and only time in Indy 500 history, a trio of brothers qualified for the same race. Don, Bill, and Dale Whittington all made the field, with Don finishing a strong 6th. Dale crashed out before the start, and never completed a single lap in his career. Four-time Indy winner A. J. Foyt started on the front row, celebrating his record 25th career Indy 500 start. Though he was caught up in the Cogan incident, his car was hastily repaired and he went on to lead 32 laps.\nRace schedule.\nA record 109 entries for the 1982 Indianapolis 500 were received by April 17, when entries closed. Seven former winners and 28 prospective rookies were among the driver entrants.\nBackground.\nAmong many stories going into the 1982 month of May was the return of A. J. Foyt to the cockpit. In July 1981, Foyt had been involved in a serious crash at the inaugural Michigan 500, suffering a compound fracture to his right arm, and a puncture wound to his leg. Foyt was sidelined for several months for recovery.\nThe two key fixtures from the controversial 1981 race took different paths for 1982. Bobby Unser took a sabbatical from racing, and would ultimately retire from the cockpit. Mario Andretti on the other hand, was back with Patrick Racing, this time running a full season in the CART series, and scaled back his participation in Formula One. This would be the first time in several years that Andretti would be spending the entire month in Indianapolis, and not traveling back and forth to Europe for his Formula One commitments.\nRule changes.\nOne major rule change regarding time trials was implemented for 1982. All cars would be allowed only two warm up laps for qualifying, down from three, which had been the rule since 1946.\nAfter two major pit fires in 1981 (Rick Mears at the Indianapolis 500 and Herm Johnson at the Michigan 500), new safety rules were implemented. Pit side fuel tanks were required to be anchored to the ground, while new high-pressure water hoses were installed the length of the pit lane. Significant improvements were also made to the fuel couplings, fuel hoses, vent hoses, and \"buckeyes\" on the cars themselves. Positive shutoff valves on the pitside fuel tanks were also made mandatory. All pit personnel were required to wear fire-resistant clothing, including not only the over-the-wall crew, but others including scorers, etc. Likewise, it would become the norm that even pit reporters for television and radio began wearing specialized firesuits as well.\nDuring the month of May 1981, word had been buzzing around the garage area that USAC was preparing to drastically change the engine formula for 1982 and beyond. The ruling would effectively ban the popular Cosworth DFX V-8, the engine that had won the Indianapolis 500 the previous four years (1978-1981). The plan was to craft the rules to require (or heavily favor) production-based, \"stock block\" engines, and reduce turbocharger boost to noncompetitive levels (to discourage their use), or ban turbochargers outright. However, during the summer of 1981 the decision was changed. The turbocharged OHC V-8 engines (namely the Cosworth DFX) would continue to be permitted, only with a smaller turbocharger unit. Teams applauded the decision, and the 1982 race would be contested with mostly similar engine specifications as the previous year.\nTime trials.\nPole day—death of Gordon Smiley.\nOn pole day, Saturday, May 15, Kevin Cogan, driving for Penske Racing set a new one-lap track record of , and a record four-lap average of . A few minutes later, he was beaten by his Penske teammate Rick Mears. Mears secured the pole position with a four-lap average of . A total of nine cars completed runs, including Gordon Johncock, rookie Bobby Rahal, and Danny Ongais.\nAt 12:15 p.m., the time trials were marred by the horrifying fatal accident of Gordon Smiley. Smiley left the pits to start his qualifying run. On his second (of two) warm up laps, he approached turn three. The back-end of the #35 Intermedics March 81C-Cosworth became loose, and Smiley over-corrected. The front wheels suddenly gained traction, the car turned and crashed head-on into the concrete wall at about . The impact of the March chassis against the wall was so hard and so violent, that the fuel tank exploded with a large fireflash, the car broke into three large sections, and the rest disintegrated into hundreds of pieces. Most of the shattered car went airborne for at least , littering the track with debris. Smiley's exposed body tumbled with the wreck hundreds of feet through the short-chute connecting turns three and four. Pieces of the car were strewn all over the track. Smiley was killed instantly from the massive trauma inflicted by the impact. According to CART medical official Steve Olvey, who was working the event, the impact was so violent that nearly every bone in Smiley's body had been shattered. Olvey also noticed an unusual gray substance on the track, which marked a trail leading to the driver. The substance was later discovered to be most of Smiley's brain. His helmet was pulled from his head during the impact.\nSmiley's death was the first at Indy since 1973, and to date, the last during a qualification attempt. Since it occurred in the remote area of turn three, and without video boards or live television, a vast majority of the fans in attendance did not see the crash up close or the immediate aftermath.\nOlvey published his autobiography \"Rapid Response: My Inside Story as a Motor Racing Life-Saver\" in 2006, where noted numerous drivers advised Smiley that his road racing approach to driving around the Speedway was unsuitable for ovals in a ground-effects car. Smiley had competed in the SCCA National Championship Runoffs, winning two championships and then the Aurora AFX1 Championship, where he won at Silverstone Circuit, the latter of which were in older Formula One cars. \nAbout 33 minutes after the wreck; at precisely 12:48 PM, track announcer Tom Carnegie learned of Smiley's fate for the first time. He immediately informed the fans watching from the grandstands: \"Ladies and gentlemen... it is with our deepest regrets that we announce the passing of Gordon Smiley.\"\nThe track remained closed for over two hours after the crash. The catch fencing needed repair, debris littered the track, and a patch of asphalt was required to repair a gash in the racing surface. After over two hours, a couple cars were dispatched by the officials to test the pavement, and they deemed it suitable for qualifying to resume. Several cars went out over the next two hours, but none challenged the speed records set earlier in the morning. A. J. Foyt put his car on the outside of the front row, and Mario Andretti qualified fourth. In a solemn mood, qualifying came to a halt around 4:55 p.m., with just over an hour left in the session.\nAt the close of pole day, the field was filled to 20 cars.\nSecond day.\nAfter the tragic circumstances of the previous day, few drivers took to the track on Sunday, May 16. A very uneventful day saw only a handful of cars even take practice laps. Only a few cars made qualifying attempts and only two were run to completion. Rain ended the session a few minutes early, and the field was filled to 22 cars.\nThird day.\nThe second week of practice saw increased track activity. The third day of time trials was scheduled for Saturday, May 22. A busy day of qualifying saw the field filled to 31 cars. Mike Chandler was fastest of the day at .\nBump day.\nOn Sunday, May 23, the field was left with two empty positions at the start of the day. Several drivers intended to make attempts but few actually took to the track. Josele Garza and Pete Halsmer went out and quickly filled the field. Only two cars were bumped all day, and despite the track being open until 6 p.m., no drivers went out after 4:03 p.m. With two hours left in the day, Desiré Wilson announced she would not make an attempt, and thus would not have a chance to become the second female to qualify at Indy.\nRace start: Kevin Cogan crash.\nOn race day, Kevin Cogan started from the middle of the front row, next to pole-sitter Mears, and A. J. Foyt. As the field approached the start/finish line to start the race, Cogan suddenly swerved right, touching and bouncing off A.J. Foyt's car. He then slid directly into the path of, and collected, Mario Andretti. Deeper in the field, the cars started to check-up. A fast-moving Dale Whittington nearly collected Geoff Brabham, lost control, spun across the track and ran into the back of Roger Mears. Both cars were eliminated. Bobby Rahal also reported getting hit from behind, but was undamaged. The green flag had not come out, and the race was immediately red-flagged.\nCogan's shocking accident took out four cars, including himself. Foyt's team was able to make repairs, and pushed his car out for the restart attempt; but Andretti was out of the race—his Patrick-prepared car was too badly damaged to continue. Meanwhile, both Andretti and Foyt were furious and outspoken about their displeasure with Cogan. Andretti, who was absolutely livid and perhaps even more angry than Foyt shunned Cogan's attempts to explain himself with a light shove, and Cogan walked with Andretti down the pit lane trying to explain himself but Andretti was having none of it.\nAndretti, speaking on live radio, as well to ABC-TV's Bill Flemming, made the exchange:\nBack in the garage area, Andretti complained about Cogan's abilities, claiming that Cogan was \"looking for trouble,\" that he \"couldn't handle the responsibilities of the front row,\" and that the Penske car he was driving was \"too good for him.\"\nThe commonly outspoken Foyt also chimed in during comments to ABC-TV's Chris Economaki with:\nAfter he had cooled off, Foyt brushed it off a little saying \"the guy pulled a stupid trick\" and then back in the garage area of the crash and of Cogan that:\nGordon Johncock, Johnny Rutherford and\nBobby Unser later placed some blame of the incident on the polesitter Rick Mears, for bringing the field down at such a slow pace. Unser, who was interviewed by ABC during their telecast was actually quoted as saying that the \"start number one was way too slow\" and that \"it is very very sad that guys with that much experience can't do a better job at starting a race\". Director of competition Roger McCluskey mentioned an overwhelming disdain from the drivers about the poor pace set at the start. Mears contended that his intentions were to keep the same pace, rather than radically speed up and slow down. In a 2009 interview, Gordon Johncock pointed out that Andretti had jumped the start, and could have avoided the spinning car of Cogan had he been lined up properly in the second row, stating that \"he (Andretti) took himself out\". Andretti's response was, \"I'm not the one who spun. … I wish I would have [stayed back with Johncock], but when it comes to the start, I start!\" \nAftermath.\nCogan quickly fell out of favor following the humiliation stemming from the accident. It was followed by a noticeable \"blacklisting\" by fans and press. Cogan nearly had the dubious distinction of taking out two of the most famous American auto racing legends and the two most successful IndyCar drivers of all time (Foyt and Andretti) on the first lap, in one move, in the biggest race of the season. The incident also further rehashed a standing feud between Penske Racing and Patrick Racing. A year earlier, Penske and Patrick had been the key fixtures in the controversial 1981 race.\nCogan did not manage to win a race in 1982, and was possibly fired by Roger Penske because of it and replaced by Al Unser in 1983.\nThe accident was never explained by the Penske team. Derrick Walker the team manager at the time, claimed that they found \"no cause\" for the accident. However, several experts had differing opinions. Rodger Ward, working for the IMS Radio Network immediately believed the rear brakes locked up. It was a common practice for drivers in the turbocharged era to \"ride the brakes\" during warm up laps in order to engage the turbocharger. Others theorized it may have happened due to a broken CV joint or halfshaft. Fellow drivers such as Johnny Rutherford and Gordon Johncock suggested that due to the slow start, Cogan may have been in first gear, and when he accelerated, the back end simply came around. Some feel that Sam Posey on ABC-TV inadvertently may have added to the controversy when he proclaimed \"absolutely no idea\" to the question of how it could have happened, and saying \"it was as if he turned the wheel intentionally.\" The comments led many to conclude that the accident may have been entirely of Cogan's doing. As soon as he climbed from the car, Cogan was observed looking at the rear end axle, suggesting that he thought something broke, which Cogan believes was the problem.\nOne year later, in an autobiography detailing his career up to that point, Foyt gave a somewhat more analytical account of what occurred than he had before, while still assigning Cogan nearly all of the responsibility. According to Foyt, the slow straightaway pace previously noted by Unser and Rutherford had been beneath the power-amplification threshold of the turbocharger, which provides a progressively higher energy boost to the engine the higher the engine's RPM. Due to the pace, competitors had to run in lower gears much later than they normally did when approaching the start. Foyt in turn maintained that Cogan had intended to jump both Foyt and Mears into the first turn through the 'stupid trick' of using lower gears, via the significantly faster acceleration they provided compared to higher gears. When Mears' insufficient pace precluded this strategy, Foyt accused Cogan of simply 'jump[ing] on it' early, even before the green flag had fully come out, whereby the resulting explosive power increase caused the car to veer sideways and '[get] away from him'. Any broken half shaft, Foyt finally stated, was merely due to the subsequently unavoidable collision with Andretti.\nYears later Donald Davidson, the historian for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, mentioned that team driver, and the more experienced, Rick Mears had a nearly identical accident during private testing at Michigan. In 2009, Roger Penske seemed to brush off ideas, stating \"Cogan said something broke, I don't know whether it did or didn't.\"\nStarting grid.\nNote: Following the Kevin Cogan crash on the pace lap, the cars of Cogan, Mario Andretti, Roger Mears, and Dale Whittington were eliminated. A. J. Foyt and Bobby Rahal's cars were damaged, but repaired during the red flag that Cogan's crash caused, and returned for the second race start. Holes were left in the grid as the eliminated drivers' spots were left vacant. 29 cars took the green flag on the second start attempt.\nFailed to Qualify.\nNOTE: The #35 Intermedics Innovator/Bill Fletcher team formed an alliance with Patrick Racing; George Snider subsequently qualified the team's backup car into the race.\nRace running.\nFirst half.\nAccording to the rules, the cars are required to maintain a minimum fuel economy of 1.8 miles per gallon. To complete two parade laps, one pace lap, and the 200 laps for the race, each car is allotted of methanol fuel in their pitside tank. Due to the aborted start, officials took the time to replenish approximately of fuel to each team's pitside tank.\nOverall, the delay stemming from the Cogan accident lasted over 45 minutes. Only 29 cars lined up for the second start attempt.\nA. J. Foyt took the lead at the start. It was the first time in his 25-year Indy career that he led the first lap of the race. After the hasty repairs from the Cogan incident, Foyt's car was precariously unproven, yet Foyt made no effort to \"feel his car out\" before charging into the lead. Meanwhile, popular second-year driver Josele Garza barely completed the first lap, and dropped out with an oil leak.\nRick Mears soon established himself as the fastest car in the field, and found the lead in the first half.\nA. J. Foyt's day ended just short of the midway point. A failed transmission linkage prevented him from pulling out of the pits. Foyt famously climbed from the cockpit, grabbed a hammer and a screwdriver, and started pounding away at the rear mechanics of the car. His attempts were futile, and the car was wheeled back to the garage area. Foyt revealed, during an interview immediately thereafter, that the Cogan crash had damaged the car's toe in alignment, and that it had been handling poorly all race up to that point. The 1982 race would be the final Indy 500 Foyt would lead during his driving career.\nFinish.\nOn a restart with 40 laps to go, Gordon Johncock came up to speed faster and passed Rick Mears for the lead on the backstretch. Most of the balance of the field was eliminated, or running several laps behind. Johncock was unable to pull away and the two cars ran nose to tail for the next twenty laps, with Mears handling better in the turns but Johncock able to find enough speed at the end of the straightaway to keep Mears from passing. Both drivers needed to make one final pit stop for fuel in order to make it to the finish.\nWith 18 laps to go Mears ducked into the pits. Racing down the pit lane, he found himself suddenly trapped behind the slower car of Herm Johnson. Mears locked up the brakes and bumped into Johnson's back wheel. The incident cost Mears several seconds. In his pit box, the Penske crew proceeded to fill his car full with of fuel, more than enough needed to make it to the finish. No tires were changed, and the crew determined that no damage was sustained from hitting Johnson's car.\nTwo laps later, Johncock dove into the pits. He precariously diced around the slower car of Jim Hickman and slid into his pit box. The Patrick Racing crew conducted a timed pit stop. The team calculated the amount of fuel needed to make it to the finish. When enough fuel had flowed into the car, a pit crew member tapped the fuel man on his back with a stick, and he disengaged. Johncock pulled away, with a pit stop many seconds quicker than that of Mears.\nBack on the track, Johncock held a lead of more than eleven seconds. It seemed he was cruising to his second Indy victory. However, his car's handling was starting to suffer. The light fuel load he took on was exacerbating a pushing condition.\nMeanwhile, Mears' fully fueled car was heavier, and handling much better. He started closing in, more than one second per lap. Johncock started driving very low in the turns, trying to alleviate the pushing condition. It became clear in the waning laps that Mears was dramatically closing in on the lead. Such a circumstance was nearly unprecedented in Indy 500 history, occurring only once before in the 1937 race. With only six other cars left running, traffic was not a factor.\nMears closed to under 3 seconds with three laps to go. With two laps to go, the margin was less than 1 second. With one lap to go, Mears pulled alongside on the mainstretch. The cars took the white flag side by side but Johncock refused to give up the lead. Once again pulling slightly ahead at the end of the straightaway, he \"chop-blocked\" Mears in the first turn and stayed ahead. Mears lost momentum but began to reel Johncock back in down the backstretch. In turn three, Johncock drove so low that he hit a bump on the inside of the track and nearly lost control. As they exited turn four, Mears tried to slingshot pass Johncock for the win. Johncock held off the challenge and won by 0.16 seconds, the closest finish in Indy 500 history at the time. Mears lost by just over one car length. It would stand as the closest finish in race history for ten years.\nIn Victory Lane, Johncock admitted to having been worried about his car's deteriorating handling as he watched Mears get closer and closer in his mirrors. He said that he had had no intention of backing off in turn one on the last lap and was prepared to go through the corner side by side if necessary. Mears, when interviewed by Bill Flemming after the race, seemed less disappointed about finishing second than thrilled to have been a part of the most dramatic finish in Indy history. Mears had noticed that Johncock's handling was going away, quipping that Johncock \"had 'er everywhere but straight\", and praised him for the ability to overcome such a challenge. Mears also conceded that Johncock's block in turn one was not a dirty move and admitted that \"it was [Johncock's] corner.\" In interviews in later years Mears said that he would not change the result of the race even if he could, although he jokingly claimed to have watched the tape over and over again \"to see if this time I get by Gordy.\"\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nLegacy.\nThe 1982 Indianapolis 500 is often considered one of the greatest editions of the race by historians, media, and fans. Race winner Gordon Johncock, who also won the tragic and forgettable 1973 race, was able to complement his record by winning one of the most exciting races. The win was bittersweet, however, for Johncock. The day after the race, Johncock's mother Frances died after a lengthy illness. Johncock learned of her death at the 500 Victory Banquet Monday night.\nKevin Cogan, who was a key fixture in the opening lap accident, was fired at the end of the season by Roger Penske and replaced by Al Unser for 1983. Mario Andretti's misfortune strengthened the perceived Andretti curse at Indy.\nDespite the historic battle at the finish, and the shocking crash at the start, the horrific fatal crash of Gordon Smiley still put a damper on the month. Smiley's death was one of four fatal motorsport accidents to occur over a span of four months. It came just one week after the fatal crash of Gilles Villeneuve during the first qualifying session at the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder. About one month later, an accident at the start of the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal killed Riccardo Paletti. Then about two months later, Jim Hickman, the 1982 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year, was killed at the Milwaukee Mile.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as anchor for the sixth year. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. The broadcast came on air at 10:15 a.m. local time, providing a 45-minute pre-race for the final time. The following year the pre-race coverage was expanded to a full hour. Several assignments were shifted, and a new member was added, Sally Larvick, who served as a roving reporter, interviewing celebrities and other dignitaries. Larvick, wife of Paul Page, was believed to be the second female reporter in the history of the network. At the start of the race, roving reporter Bob Forbes rode in one of the pace cars on the parade lap. Veteran Howdy Bell moved to the backstretch, Doug Zink moved from turn three to turn two, and Larry Henry took over the third turn position.\nFor 1982, the famous commercial out cue of the network was changed to \"Now stay tuned for the Greatest Spectacle in Sports!\" \nThe broadcast crew was critically acclaimed for their collective call of the closing laps of the 1982 race.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. After controversy the previous year, Jackie Stewart was moved from the booth to a new host position in \"ABC Race Central.\" Sam Posey returned to the booth as driver expert, and Jack Whitaker joined the crew for in-depth features and commentary. Whitaker rode along and reported live from inside the pace car at the start of the race. Clyde Lee, anchorman for WRTV (ABC's affiliate in Indianapolis), was also on hand to report on drivers who happened to drop out of the race, as well as from the infield hospital.\nProducer Mike Pearl would receive a Sports Emmy award for his efforts in the telecast, which won three total.\nPole day time trials on ABC featured Al Michaels, Jackie Stewart, and Sam Posey.\nThe broadcast has re-aired numerous times on ESPN Classic since April 2000. In May 2004, the broadcast was featured on ESPN Classic's \"Big Ticket\" series, featuring interviews with Gordon Johncock and Rick Mears, hosted by Gary Miller."

        "title": "1983 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 67th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday, May 29, 1983. After finishing second three times (1977, 1978, 1980), winning the pole position twice (1977–1978), and being the fastest qualifier one additional time (1981), Tom Sneva finally shook his \"bridesmaid\" status and won his first and only Indianapolis 500. The win also represented the record seventh Indy victory that chief mechanic George Bignotti was involved with.\nIn the final twenty laps, three-time winner Al Unser Sr. was leading Tom Sneva. Unser was seeking his record-tying fourth Indy victory. His son, rookie Al Unser Jr., was several laps down, but was positioned right behind his father. Al Jr. created a firestorm of controversy when it appeared that he was blocking Sneva intentionally to aid his father. Unser Jr. admitted to running interference for his father, claiming he was trying to create \"dirty air\" and turbulence for Sneva. He stopped short, however, of calling it \"blocking\". After several anxious laps, Sneva finally slipped both Al Jr. and Al Sr., using lapped traffic to his advantage. Sneva opened up an 11-second lead, and took the checkered flag for his long-awaited Indy victory.\nRookie Teo Fabi headlined time trials by winning the pole position, and on race day he led the first 23 laps. Fabi's day was short, however, as he dropped out with a bad fuel gasket. The effort earned him the rookie of the year award. Fabi would go on to win four races during the season and finished second to Al Unser Sr. for the CART points championship.\nThe 1983 Indy 500 ushered in a new era of civility and stability in the sport of Indy car racing. After four years of conflict and organizational disputes between USAC and CART, the two sanctioning bodies came to an amicable truce. The Indianapolis 500 would be sanctioned singly by USAC, and officially would be part of the ceremonial Gold Crown championship. However, the race was now recognized on the CART schedule, and counted towards the 1983 CART PPG Indy Car World Series points championship. The field for the Indy 500 going forward would consist primarily of CART-based teams, along with numerous one-off (\"Indy-only\") entries. Despite various squabbles and minor technical differences between the sanctioning bodies, this arrangement would remain in place, with relative harmony, through 1995.\nBackground.\nThe USAC technical committee issued a rule change for 1983, scaling back side skirts and declaring that \"all bodywork or aerodynamic devices must be at least one inch above the bottom of the car's tub.\" During time trials, a total of 15 cars in the qualifying line would fail pre-qualifying technical inspection, raising tempers and drawing the ire of competitors. Some teams charged that USAC was inconsistent in their enforcement and their measuring, since they used a different (and possibly less-accurate) tool than the CART series officials utilized at other races. In addition, some teams claimed the first several cars in line were not scrutinized as heavily as those deeper in line.\nThe evolving aerodynamic rules coincided with the emergence of the Robin Herd-designed March chassis becoming the vehicle of choice for the mid-1980s. Coupled with the widely used Cosworth DFX engine, the \"customer car\" era began to dominate the sport of Indy car racing. Penske, among other teams, elected to scale back, or even abandon their in-house chassis programs in favor of the English-built March for the next few seasons. The March's aerodynamic advancements, downforce, and affordable cost were among the reasons it emerged as the favorite among the competitors. The \"customer car\" era also was popular with the smaller-budget teams, as it allowed them access to top equipment, leveling the playing field, and shrinking the differences between haves and the have-nots. The 1983 race would be the first of five consecutive Indy 500 victories for March Engineering.\nTime trials.\nPole day time trials was scheduled for Saturday May 14. Rain, however, kept cars off the track nearly all day. At 4:15 p.m., the track finally opened for practice, but it was brief and interrupted by several yellow lights. Officials closed the track at 5:49 p.m., without a single car making a qualifying attempt. On Sunday May 15, rain washed out the entire day. It was the first time since 1978 that not a single car qualified on the first weekend. Pole day time trials was moved to the second weekend.\nThree-time winner Johnny Rutherford was sidelined after two major crashes. On May 8, he crashed in turn one, suffering minor injuries. On May 18, he suffered a more serious crash in turn 3. He broke his left foot and left ankle, and was forced to sit out the 1983 race.\nPole Day – Saturday May 21.\nPole day started with Mike Mosley (205.372 mph) taking the top spot early on. Rick Mears, a favorite for the pole, had his effort fall short, and he qualified at 204.301 mph.\nTom Sneva was the next shot at the front row, but his speed of 203.687 mph was only third-fastest at the moment. The next car out was rookie Teo Fabi, who had raised eyebrows during the week, posting practice speeds near the top of the speed chart. Fabi set a new one-lap track record of 208.049 mph, and set a four-lap record of 207.395 mph, securing the pole position. Fabi became the first rookie to win the pole since Walt Faulkner in 1950.\nA very busy day saw 42 attempts and 33 cars complete qualifying runs. For the first time in modern history, the field was filled to 33 cars in one day.\nOn a sad note, Tony Foyt Sr., the father of A. J. Foyt as well as his former chief mechanic, died after battling lung cancer. After qualifying on Saturday, A. J. Foyt flew to Houston to visit his ailing father. At 8 p.m., Tony Foyt Sr. lapsed into a coma, and died at 10 p.m.\nBump Day – Sunday May 22.\nThe day opened with John Mahler (180.022 mph) on the bubble. Rain again hampered time trials, and the track did not open until nearly 2 p.m.\nPhil Krueger wrecked during a practice run, and Gary Bettenhausen waved off a run after one lap over 193 mph.\nAt 4:14 p.m., Dennis Firestone completed a run of 190.888 mph, with heavy rain beginning to fall on his last lap, bumping Mahler, and the track was soaked and closed for the day. The 6 o'clock gun fired with several drivers, including Bettenhausen, Bill Alsup, and Dick Ferguson all left sitting in line.\nRace summary.\nFirst half.\nRookie Teo Fabi took the lead from the pole position and led the first 23 laps. A. J. Foyt, who earlier in the week had attended his father's funeral, dropped out early with a broken transmission u-joint linkage. At almost the same time, George Snider, Foyt's other team car, dropped out with ignition failure. Both Foyt cars were out just beyond the 50-mile mark. After showing speed early, Fabi dropped out with a bad fuel gasket. During an early pit stop, the refueling mechanism failed, and fuel spilled around the car, but it did not ignite.\nOn lap 81, Johnny Parsons spun in front of Mario Andretti in turn one. Both cars crashed hard into the outside wall. It was Andretti's first ride at Indy with Newman/Haas Racing, and yet another misfortune for him at the 500.\nSecond half.\nFirst half contender Bobby Rahal dropped out with a punctured radiator. The lead in the second half was maintained by Tom Sneva and Al Unser Sr. Sneva's teammate Kevin Cogan, as well as Geoff Brabham were also running near the top five.\nOn lap 172, Tom Sneva led with Al Unser Sr. second. Sneva was right behind the lapped car of Mike Mosley when his pit crew put out the sign board for him to make his final pit stop. Seconds later, Mosley spun right in front of Sneva coming out of turn one and crashed into the outside wall. Mosely suffered a bruised foot in the wreck. Sneva veered to the inside and narrowly avoided the incident. Mosley's notable \"Indy jinx\" continued, and it would be his final lap at the Speedway - he was killed in a traffic accident less than a year later.\nWith the yellow out, Sneva pitted the next time around, his final scheduled pit stop of the day. Al Unser Sr. was also in the pits. Unser had a much faster pit stop, electing not to change tires, and came out in the lead. Sneva was now second.\nFinish.\nThe green flag came back out on lap 176 with Al Unser Sr. leading and Tom Sneva in second. As the cars were going through turn four, the 10th place car of rookie Al Unser Jr. (five laps down at the time) jumped the restart. He passed both Sneva and his father Al Sr. One lap later, Al Jr. allowed his father by, and settled in between his father and second place Tom Sneva. Over the next several laps, it became clear that Al Jr. was attempting to run interference for his father. Al Jr. was known to openly root for his father, and incidentally it was Al Sr.'s 44th birthday. As the race hit lap 180, officials started displaying Al Unser Jr. the blue flag.\nWhile many feel Al Jr. did not actually make many onerous and intentional \"blocking\" moves, he did create a significant amount of \"dirty air\" for Sneva, and did not yield the preferred racing line. Despite the impedance, Al Sr. was not pulling away nor seemed able to extend his lead. The three cars continued to run very close together. As the laps dwindled, the controversy began to grow.\nWith 13 laps to go, Sneva pulled alongside Al Unser Jr. on the frontstretch. The two cars went side-by-side into turn one, but Al Jr. refused to give up the ground.\nWith ten laps to go, the three cars caught up to lapped traffic. Al Jr. got stuck behind the car of Dick Simon, and Sneva immediately pounced on the moment. Sneva veered down low, passed Al Jr. and Simon in consecutive corners, and set his sights on the leader. Down the backstretch, Sneva set up his pass and easily got by Al Unser Sr. going into turn three. He passed two more cars before the end of the lap and immediately began building a lead.\nWith an open track ahead of him now, Tom Sneva picked up the pace and put considerable distance between himself and Unser. Sneva cruised to victory, by a margin of 11.174 seconds. It was Sneva's first Indy 500 victory (after three previous runner-up finishes) and chief mechanic George Bignotti's record seventh Indy 500 victory.\nAfter stirring up controversy, Al Unser Jr. ran out of fuel on the final lap. He stalled on the course before reaching the finish line, and was scored six laps down at the finish.\nPost race.\nIn post-race interviews, Al Unser Jr. admitted to running interference for his father, claiming he was trying to create \"dirty air\" and turbulence for Sneva. He stopped short, however, of calling it \"blocking.\" Al Jr. was highly criticized for the actions, by both competitors and media. However, after the race USAC examined the incident, and issued no penalties for blocking, citing the fact that he did not actually break any written rules. Al Unser Sr. claimed he did not know what was going on behind him, because he lost one of his rear-view mirrors, and the other one was broken. Furthermore, Al Sr. noted that he made a miscalculation on his final pit stop, ordering his crew to not change tires. As a result, his handling went away in the closing laps. While Al Jr. and Sneva were sparring, Al Sr. was instead preoccupied with nursing his loose, ill-handling machine.\nSneva charged Al Jr. with jumping the restart and illegally passing the two leaders before the green came out. After the race Al Jr. was issued a two-lap penalty for passing two cars before the green light, but the penalty did not cost him any positions. Unser still finished in the top ten as the highest finishing rookie. However, he lost out on the rookie of the year award, which went to polesitter Teo Fabi.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as anchor for the seventh year. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. The crew saw little change from 1982, but some of the assignments were shifted. Longtime radio veteran Luke Walton assumed his customary duty during the pre-race ceremonies of introducing the starting command. However, he did not serve as a pit reporter during the race itself. Walton would continue on the broadcast, but only in a limited role, through 1988.\nBob Forbes rode in one of the pace cars during the parade lap.\nLou Palmer maintained his traditional location at the far south end of the pits. However, the other pit reporters appeared to have lesser-defined zones for 1983. During the first half of the race, all pit reporters congregated around the leaders' pits, including roving reporter Bob Forbes. During the second half of the race, Jerry Baker moved up to the north pits and Chuck Marlowe covered the center pits. Forbes then moved to the garage area and track hospital, while Palmer stayed in the south end. Sally Larvick returned for her second race, conducting interviews throughout the broadcast.\nFor 1983, after a brief one-year change, the famous commercial out-cue was restored back to \"Now stay tuned for the Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\" For the first time, the broadcast signed on at 10:00 a.m. local time, providing one-hour of pre-race coverage.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. Jim McKay returned as anchor, while Jackie Stewart reprised the host position in \"ABC Race Central.\" Sam Posey returned to the booth as driver expert, while Jim Lampley made his first appearance, covering primarily the garages and medical center. Anne Simon, a sideline reporter at ABC Sports, joined the crew for in-depth features, and is believed to be the first female television reporter at Indy.\nFor the first time ever, the broadcast featured a RaceCam. On-board cameras were mounted in the cars of Rick Mears and Al Unser Sr., but both failed partway through the race.\nThe broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic starting in May 2011.\nNotes.\nReferences.\n5. https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/30/sports/sneva-takes-indianapolis-500-with-al-unser-sr-2d.html"

        "title": "2005 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 89th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 29, 2005. It was the premier event of the 2005 IndyCar Series season and the tenth Indy 500 sanctioned by the Indy Racing League. Dan Wheldon won the race, his first of two Indy victories (2005 and 2011). Wheldon became the first British-born winner since Graham Hill in 1966. It was the second consecutive Indy victory for Honda, and the first victory for the Dallara chassis since 2002. It was also the long-awaited first Indianapolis 500 victory for car owner Michael Andretti of Andretti-Green Racing. After many years of failing to win the race as a driver (contributing to the perception of the so-called Andretti Curse), Andretti finally achieved victory at Indianapolis as an owner.\nRookie Danica Patrick, who qualified and finished 4th, became the first female driver in Indy history to lead laps during the race. She led three times for a total of 19 laps and won the Rookie of the Year award. Considerable media hype and attention was focused on the race and on Patrick in particular during the month, giving birth to the term \"Danica Mania\". Her 4th place starting position broke the record set by Lyn St. James (6th in 1994) and her 4th place finishing position broke the record set by Janet Guthrie (9th in 1978).\nThe increased attention going into the race helped register a 6.5 Nielsen rating, the highest since 1996. Also making headlines during the month of May was the return of 1999 winner Kenny Bräck. After suffering a violent crash at Texas in October 2003, Bräck sat out the 2004 season, recovering from serious injuries. In what would be his final IndyCar race, he drove in substitution for Buddy Rice. Rice, the 2004 winner suffered a concussion in a practice crash on May 11, and was forced to sit out the event. Bräck was the overall fastest qualifier during time trials but dropped out of the race near the halfway point due to mechanical problems.\nBackground.\nOver the offseason, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was milled and repaved in asphalt. Selective diamond grinding was done in an effort to smooth out bumps in the turns. On April 5, 2005, a private test session saw four teams (AGR, Ganassi, Rahal, and Panther) test for Firestone. The session was canceled, however, when the inconsistent pavement in the turns created an unsuitable dual level of grip in the corners. A week later, the entire track was diamond ground to cure the problem.\nThe schedule for the Month of May was slightly retooled for 2005. The annual rookie orientation program was moved to opening day, as well as the 2nd day of official activity. Previously, in most cases, rookie orientation was held prior to the traditional \"opening day\" of practice, often in April. Veteran practice would commence on Tuesday, the 3rd day overall.\nCarb Day, the traditional last day of practice before the race, was moved from its familiar Thursday slot to Friday of the race weekend. After 4 years of having 3 days of time trials scheduled (2001–2004), time trials reverted to 4 days, and a new format (dubbed \"11/11/11\") was introduced.\nAfter they were first allowed in 2004, single-point refueling rigs were made mandatory for 2005.\nAfter several decades of the race traditionally starting at 11:00 a.m. local time (), the start time was moved to 12:00 p.m. EST (1:00 p.m. ).\nTeam and driver changes.\nAmong the numerous team/driver changes for 2005 included Rahal Letterman Racing. Defending Indy 500 winner Buddy Rice returned, and was joined by rookie Danica Patrick. Newman/Haas Racing returned to the Indy 500, entering Sébastien Bourdais and Bruno Junqueira.\nTwo-time winner Al Unser Jr. took a brief retirement from driving in 2005 and did not enter. With him along with others such as Michael Andretti and Arie Luyendyk on the sidelines, no participants from the 1980s would qualify for the field, the first time ever.\nPractice (week 1).\nSunday May 8.\nOpening day of practice focused on rookie orientation. The coveted 1st driver on the track was Danica Patrick. Among the top drivers of the day were Patrick at , Ryan Briscoe, and Patrick Carpentier. 7 out of the 9 drivers participating completed their required rookie test.\nMonday May 9.\nThe 2nd day of rookie orientation saw Danica Patrick again set the pace. She set the fastest lap of the month thus far at . Sébastien Bourdais completed his rookie test, while Jeff Ward completed a refresher test.\nTuesday May 10.\nThe 1st full day of veteran practice saw heavy activity. Dan Wheldon led the speed chart at , and no incidents were reported.\nWednesday May 11.\nDefending Indy 500 winner Buddy Rice suffered a significant crash at 12:16 p.m. The car spun in Turn 2 and made heavy contact to the rear of the car. Kosuke Matsuura spun to avoid the crash, but received minimal damage. Rice was transported to Methodist Hospital with a concussion.\nRain ended the day about a half hour early, with Tony Kanaan fastest of the day, and fastest of the month thus far, at .\nThursday May 12.\nDarren Manning and Paul Dana both suffered single-car crashes during the session, but neither were seriously injured. Tony Kanaan led the pace early over , but late in the day, Danica Patrick upped the speed to . It marked the fastest lap thus far during the month, and the 1st time a female driver had led the speed chart on a full day of practice (without a rain delay) since 1977.\nFriday May 13.\n\"Fast Friday\" practice saw cloudy skies, and warm temperatures. Paul Dana wrecked his backup car, crashing for the 2nd day in a row. Exiting Turn 2, Dana spun and hit the outside wall, and slid down the back stretch. Sam Hornish Jr. hit a piece of debris from the wreck on the back stretch, and did a full flip. The car came down upright, but continued to spin and came to a rest overturned. Hornish was uninjured, but Dana was taken to the hospital for further evaluation.\nTomas Scheckter turned the fastest lap thus far around 1 p.m., at . Rain began to fall shortly after 2 p.m., and closed the track for the day.\nTime trials (weekend 1).\nSaturday May 14.\nRain fell overnight and into the morning, preventing any track activity. A new qualifying format was put into place for 2005, providing that only the top 11 cars would secure positions on Pole Day, and bumping would then occur. Track officials decided to cancel activities for the day at 12:15 p.m., and postpone Pole Qualifying until Sunday.\nShortly after the official postponement, the rain stopped and blue skies emerged. Some complained that qualifying could have been held after all, but head official Brian Barnhart still felt there would not be sufficient time to finish the qualifying order.\nSunday May 15 (Pole Day).\nCool temperatures in the mid-50s were observed for morning practice. Danica Patrick set the fastest lap of the entire month during the morning session at . The lap made her a favorite for the front row. Dario Franchitti and Tony Kanaan were close behind on the speed chart.\nDue to the rainout on Saturday, 22 positions were to be filled on Sunday. After the field filled to 22 cars, bumping would begin.\nAt noon, Scott Sharp was the 1st car to make a qualifying attempt. He placed himself in the field with a speed of . Moments later, Tony Kanaan put himself on the provisional pole position with a speed of .\nAt 12:45 p.m. Eastern time, Danica Patrick took to the track. On her 1st lap, midway through Turn 1, the back end of the car wiggled a bit, and slowed her exit from the turn. The 1st lap was a disappointing . The 2nd lap, however, increased to . Her 4th and final lap was run at , the fastest single lap of the day. The final 4-lap average of put her in the 4th starting position. Many feel that if not for the mistake on the 1st lap, her speed would have been sufficient to secure the pole position.\nLater in the day, Sam Hornish Jr. bumped his way onto the front row. Hélio Castroneves withdrew his earlier speed, but ended up losing a position when he re-qualified. The field filled to 22 cars, and the day ended as Jaques Lazier was \"bumped\".\nPractice (week 2).\nWednesday May 18.\nRahal Letterman Racing named Kenny Bräck as the replacement for injured Buddy Rice. Brack was the 1999 winner, but sat out the 2004 season recovering from a massive crash in October 2003 at Texas.\nNearly 2,500 laps were run during the afternoon, with Dan Wheldon fastest at . The fastest non-qualified car was Kenny Bräck, already up to .\nThursday May 19.\nRain washed out all practice for the day.\nFriday May 20.\nAnother busy day of practice saw 2,228 laps completed incident-free. Dan Wheldon remained on top of the speech chart at , until Tony Kanaan, at , bumped him off in the final hour.\nArie Luyendyk Jr., attempting to complete his rookie test, suffered gearbox trouble, then later blew an engine.\nTime trials (weekend 2).\nSaturday May 21.\nThe 3rd day of time trials saw the field fill to 32 cars. In the 1st hour, Ryan Briscoe, Marty Roth and Kenny Bräck completed runs. Bräck qualified at , the fastest qualifier in the field. Though he qualified faster than polesitter Tony Kanaan, as a 3rd day qualifier, Bräck would be required to start 22nd.\nAfter blowing an engine earlier, A. J. Foyt IV put a car in the field, and the field finished the day with 1 grid position open.\nSunday May 22 (Bump day).\nWith 1 position open, very few teams in the garage area were prepared to make a qualifying attempt. Most teams used the morning and afternoon sessions for practice. Arie Luyendyk Jr. was the only entry going into the day confirming an intent to qualify.\nAt 3:10 p.m., Luyendyk Jr. completed a run at , and filled the field to 33 cars. Luyendyk Jr. was the slowest car in the field, and on the bubble. However, it appeared that Luyendyk would be safe, with no other teams preparing to qualify.\nShortly after the run, A. J. Foyt Racing announced that they had signed veteran Felipe Giaffone, and he would attempt to qualify. Giaffone had been shopping with his wife at Babies \"Я\" Us when he got a telephone call to run over to the Speedway. Within 2 hours of being at the store, Giaffone was suited up and ready to drive. In less than 45 minutes, he was up to speed and ready to qualify.\nAt 5:36 p.m., with less than 25 minutes left in the day, Giaffone took to the track and easily bumped Luyendyk Jr. from the field. Luyendyk's team quickly scrambled his car to go out 1 final time. With 1 minute remaining before the 6 o'clock gun, Luyendyk entered the track. His speed was slow, and he fell more than shy of bumping his way into the field.\nStarting grid.\n' = former Indianapolis 500 winner; ' = Indianapolis 500 rookie\nCarb Day.\nFor the first time in modern scheduling, Carb Day was moved to the Friday before the race (May 27). It was previously held on a Thursday. The final practice session was also trimmed back to 1 hour.\nAll 33 qualified cars took to the track. 9 minutes into the session, Buddy Lazier wrecked coming out of Turn 4, sliding along the outside wall down the front stretch. Lazier was not seriously injured, but the car would have to be repaired before Sunday.\nDanica Patrick led the speed chart at , and no other serious issues were reported.\nLater in the afternoon, Penske Racing with driver Sam Hornish Jr. won the Checker's/Rally's Pit Stop Challenge. They defeated Andretti Green Racing (Bryan Herta) in the final round.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nRace day emerged warm and sunny, with temperatures in the mid 70s (°F), and no chance of rain. Speedway chairperson Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines at 11:58 a.m. (EST). The field assembled for 2 parade laps and 1 pace lap behind the Chevrolet Corvette C6 pace car, driven by Colin Powell.\nAt the start, a very well-aligned field saw polesitter Tony Kanaan take the lead into Turn 1. The field circulated safely through the 1st lap. In Turn 3, Sam Hornish Jr. passed Kanaan for the lead, and led the 1st lap. Kanaan re-took the lead on lap 3. The duo traded the lead once more before Larry Foyt crashed on lap 18, bringing out the first caution.\nMost of the leaders pitted under the yellow, and Kanaan won the race off the pit road.\nFirst half.\nSam Hornish Jr. took the lead on lap 38, and the race began to settle into a pace. On lap 55, a series of green flag pit stops shuffled the field momentarily. Hornish ducked into the pits first, followed by Kanaan. The shuffle brought Danica Patrick to the lead on lap 56. It marked the 1st time in Indy 500 history that a female driver led a lap in competition. She pitted the next time around, and Hornish emerged once again as the leader.\nOn lap 78, Bruno Junqueira went to pass the lap car of A. J. Foyt IV in turn 2. The 2 cars touched, and Junqueira crashed hard into the outside wall. He suffered a concussion and fractured vertebrae.\nKenny Bräck headed for the pits on lap 82 with mechanical trouble. The car eventually dropped out due to a broken wishbone suspension.\nAs they approached the halfway point, Hornish and Kanaan again battled back and forth for the lead.\nSecond half.\nOn lap 114, Richie Hearn and Scott Dixon tangled and crashed in Turn 1. On the restart, Kanaan and Dario Franchitti passed Hornish on the front stretch, and pulled away from the field.\nOn lap 147, Sam Hornish Jr. went to pass Sébastien Bourdais on the outside of Turn 1. He slid high, and smacked the outside wall. The leaders pitted on lap 149, which meant that only 1 more fuel stop would be required for each car. Exiting the pits, Bryan Herta was penalized for speeding on pit road, and was moved to the rear of the field for the upcoming restart.\nOn 155, the field prepared to go back to green. Accelerating in the north short chute, Danica Patrick, running 8th, did a half-spin, and tagged Tomáš Enge. Tomas Scheckter spun to avoid the crash, and wrecked into the inside wall. Jeff Bucknum, Patrick Carpentier, and Jaques Lazier also got caught up in the melee. Patrick damaged her nosecone and left front wing, and ducked immediately into the pits. The team replaced the nose of the car, then a second pit stop (lap 159) saw her change tires and top off the fuel. Patrick dropped to 11th, the last car on the lead lap. Just before the restart on lap 161, Bryan Herta ducked into the pits, and topped off the fuel. The team intended to go the distance without another pit stop.\nFinish.\nWith 30 laps to go, Dan Wheldon led Vitor Meira. Roger Yasukawa brought out the yellow when his car blew its engine down the front stretch. All of the leaders except Patrick and Herta went to the pits. Staying out, Patrick and Herta shuffled up to the front of the field. Patrick took the lead for the 2nd time of the day on lap 172, and led Herta on the lap 173 restart. To the delight of the crowd, Patrick pulled out to a 1-second lead. Her crew instructed her to dial down the fuel mixture (in an effort to make it to the finish), and her lead began to dwindle. Dan Wheldon caught her on lap 186, and took the lead. At the same time, Kosuke Matsuura hit the wall in the exit of Turn 4.\nWith 10 laps to go, the green flag came back out. Patrick darted around Wheldon, and took the lead into Turn 1. She held the lead for 3 laps. With 7 laps to go, Wheldon passed her once again, and pulled out to a lead. With less than 3 laps to go, Vítor Meira and Bryan Herta managed to get by Patrick, while Wheldon continued to pull away. Down the back stretch with less than 1½ laps to go, Buddy Lazier passed Sébastien Bourdais on the outside for 5th place. Bourdais got loose in Turn 3, and crashed into the outside wall. The yellow and white flags were displayed, and 1 lap later, Dan Wheldon won the race under caution.\nBryan Herta's fuel strategy worked out, and he came home 3rd. Danica Patrick held on to 4th place, beating Janet Guthrie's Indy 500 record (9th place in 1978) for the best finish by a female driver. Buddy Lazier finished a strong 5th, despite nursing a broken front wing after contact by Scott Sharp.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nRace statistics.\n7 drivers led the race, with a total of 27 lead changes.\nAftermath.\nThe massive media attention going into the race delivered a high television rating, and brought the IndyCar Series back into the limelight after several slumping years. Dan Wheldon rode the wave of success to six total victories in 2005, and clinched the 2005 IndyCar Series championship.\nDanica Patrick, however, emerged from the race as the biggest star. She was interviewed on \"Good Morning America\" the morning after the race, and appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\". Patrick became a household name nearly overnight, and became a \"watercooler\" topic.\n2 weeks after the race, other drivers in the series started to embrace and make light of the attention. Race winner Dan Wheldon wore a t shirt stating \"I actually 'won' the Indy 500.\" Buddy Rice, the 2004 Indy 500 winner sported a shirt saying \"Danica's teammate,\" while Vítor Meira, who finished 2nd wore a shirt with \"Danica's other teammate.\"\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. Mike King served as chief announcer. Pancho Carter served as \"driver expert\", a role he also participated as in 1988.\nThe four turn reporters remained the same from the previous year. In the pit area Kim Morris and Jim Murphy departed. Joining the crew were Nicole Manske and USAC Midget champion Kevin Olson. During the pre-race, Olson interviewed David Letterman, a segment of the broadcast that would become a fixture in subsequent years.\nAmong the special guests interviewed in the booth were former Secretary of State Colin Powell and the recently elected Governor of Indiana Mitch Daniels. Sponsor guests interviewed in the booth included Tim Manganello (BorgWarner), Keith Sirios (Checkers and Rally's), Al Spire (Firestone), John Middlebrook (GM), and Keith Newman (Jim Beam).\nTelevision.\nFor 2005, ABC Sports replaced veteran announcer Paul Page with Todd Harris. Harris had previously covered the \"World's Strongest Man\" competitions, and worked as a sideline–pit reporter. However, he was inexperienced in anchoring live sports, and did not personally pursue the role. Harris was joined by analyst Scott Goodyear in the booth. Gone from the broadcast was veteran Paul Page, who had covered the 500 on television or radio dating back to 1974.\nAlso new to the broadcast was Brent Musburger, who took over the host role.\nThe \"Wide World of Sports\" telecast opened with the pre-race billed as \"Firestone Race Day\". The opening teaser entitled \"Speed City\", created by Brice Bowman of Earshot Audio Post, would eventually earn a Sports Emmy for \"Outstanding post-produced audio/sound\".\nControversy.\nGoing into the race broadcast, one of the most significant stories of the month was Danica Patrick qualifying 4th, and having a legitimate chance to win the race. ABC Sports planned to focus considerably on Patrick during the pre-race and race running. Many felt that ABC was ignoring the other drivers, including polesitter Tony Kanaan and eventual winner Dan Wheldon. In the days after the race, ABC, and Harris in particular, were largely criticised by columnists and bloggers for poor coverage, and for biased and subjective coverage of Patrick.\nIt was pointed out that despite the close attention, neither Harris nor Goodyear noticed that Patrick had taken the lead during a sequence of pit stops on lap 56. Nine laps later, as ABC returned from commercial, Harris mentioned Patrick having taken the lead for the first time. His comments were criticised as he said she \"...turned the trick...\" (usually a sexual reference), and that \"Fifty years from now you will remember where you were when Danica Patrick made not only motorsports history, but she joined the likes of Amelia Earhart and Sally Ride in a barrier-breaking performance...\" Of which Jerry Greene of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" wrote \"I seriously doubt it, Todd.\" Greene also wrote that Harris \"said many stupid things Sunday because of Ms. Patrick's efforts.\"\nRichard Sandomir wrote that Harris and Goodyear faltered in three distinct instances late in the race. With 13 laps to go, they closely examined Dan Wheldon taking the lead by the nose of the car at the line repeatedly when a caution came out. It was portrayed as if they were racing back to the caution. However, such was not allowed under Indy Racing League rules. It was later observed that the caution light did not turn on until the cars were in turn 1 (well after Wheldon had completed the pass), and the attention focused at the start–finish line was misguided, misleading, and irrelevant.\nThree laps later, Harris awkwardly waited ten seconds before noting that Patrick had re-taken the lead on the restart. When Wheldon took the lead for good on lap 193, Harris again hesitated, and waited 20 seconds to report the move, and another 30 seconds to report that Patrick had dropped to 4th place. Sandomir also criticized a perceived \"softball\" post-race interview of Patrick by Jerry Punch.\n\"Houston Chronicle\" writer David Barron said during the pre-race show and the race's first 90 minutes, he \"counted an average of one Patrick reference every five minutes, and each reference went on for some time.\" Others blogged that ABC was intentionally bringing attention to Patrick's looks, at the same time trying to downplay them.\nWith all the hoopla regarding Danica Patrick it was also seen as interesting by some that the song that was played during the closing credits of the broadcast was a song by the title \"Luckiest Man Alive\" by the Finn Brothers. Some felt that while jumping on the Danica hype for all it was worth this pointed to ABC never really taking the idea seriously that she might actually win. Of course there could've been another version of the closing credits with another song available if she had won but no one at ABC has ever commented on it.\nAt the end of the 2005 season, Todd Harris was removed from the booth, and replaced with veteran Marty Reid."

        "title": "2004 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 88th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 30, 2004. It was part of the 2004 IndyCar Series season and the ninth Indy 500 sanctioned by the Indy Racing League. Buddy Rice won the pole position, the pit stop contest, led the most laps, and won the race for team owners Bobby Rahal and David Letterman.\nThe race began about two hours behind schedule due to a morning rain delay. After 27 laps had been completed, rain began to fall again and threatened to wash out the rest of the day. About two hours later, the rain had ceased, and the track was dried. The race resumed on lap 28, and cruised beyond the halfway point to make the race official. At the 150-lap mark, the race had been very competitive up to that point, but was destined to come down to the final round of pit stops to decide the winner. Moreover, dark skies were looming, and inclement weather was moving back into the area. The race appeared to be turning into a weather battle. Some leaders headed for the pits for their final pit stops. At the same time, a handful of teams gambled by staying out, in hopes that they could stretch their fuel and be leading the race when the approaching rain arrived.\nDespite desperate attempts to prevail over the approaching rain storm, all of the leaders ultimately were forced to cycle through their final round of pit stops. Nobody was able to stretch their fuel long enough to beat the rain. Buddy Rice, who had led the most laps thus far, re-emerged as the leader. The race was ended after 450 miles (180 laps), just 50 miles (20 laps) short of the scheduled distance. A severe thunderstorm, which eventually produced an F2 tornado, formed in the area of the speedway, shutting the track down, and sending the spectators and competitors for cover. Buddy Rice was declared the winner, his first victory in championship-level competition.\nHonda, which had first arrived at Indianapolis in 1994, scored its long-anticipated first Indy 500 victory. It was also the fourth and final Indy victory for the Panoz G-Force chassis.\nPractice.\nRules changes were implemented before the start of the season, which reduced engine displacement from 3.5 L down to 3.0 L. In addition, on-board capacity of fuel was reduced from 35 gallons down to 30. The changes were made in an effort to curtail speeds, which had crept up into the low 230 mph range in 2003. It was also in the wake of a fatal accident at the Speedway. On October 22, 2003, during an off-season tire test, Tony Renna was killed in a crash. On a cool 50 degree morning, Renna spun in turn three, became airborne, and crashed into the outside wall and catch fence. The car was heavily damaged, and Renna died of massive internal trauma.\nFor the first time, single-point refueling rigs were allowed. During pit stops, teams were now allowed to utilize a single combined fuel/vent hose assembly. This eliminated the need for a separate vent hose and dedicated vent hose operator, improving safety.\nRookie Orientation.\nRookie orientation was held April 26, with seven drivers participating. Newcomers Ed Carpenter, Kosuke Matsuura, Mark Taylor, and Luis Díaz passed all four phases of the rookie tests. Jeff Simmons and Marty Roth passed three phases, and can pass the fourth phase during routine practice.\nLarry Foyt participated, but due to previous high-speed oval experience, was exempted from needing to pass the four-phase test.\nCarpenter led the speed chart at 215.584 mph. Though Díaz passed the rookie test, he did not return with Ganassi for practice come May.\nSunday May 9.\nScott Dixon led the speed chart with a lap of 219.760 mph on opening day. No incidents were reported.\nMonday May 10.\nTrack remained closed most of the afternoon, due to thunder storms. The track re-opened just before 5 p.m. and Hélio Castroneves set the fastest lap of the month at 220.300 mph. Late in the day, Robby Gordon spun and hit the outside wall in turn 2 but was uninjured.\nTuesday May 11.\nFelipe Giaffone brushed the wall in the north chute, then slid along the wall to the entrance to the pits. He was uninjured. Adrián Fernández became the first driver of the month to break the 221 mph barrier but Kosuke Matsuura (221.857 mph) ended up with the fastest lap of the day.\nWednesday May 12.\nTony Kanaan drove the fastest lap of the month, at 222.668 mph.\nThursday May 13.\nRain kept the track closed until 3 p.m. The session was ended about 10 minutes early when Scott Sharp crashed in turn 1. Hélio Castroneves turned the fastest lap of the day (221.156 mph). Buddy Rice was among the top five for the first time all week.\n\"Fast\" Friday May 14.\nThe track opened at 11 a.m. but lasted only four minutes, as rain began falling and closed the track for the day. During the brief session, only four cars had entered the track with Sarah Fisher (212.616 mph) the only car to run a single lap at speed.\nTime trials: weekend 1.\nPole Day - Saturday May 15.\nPole day dawned cool and damp. Overnight rain kept the track closed until shortly after 12 noon. During the first practice session, Tony Kanaan reached 223.224 mph, the fastest lap of the month.\nPole qualifying began at 2:15 p.m. Roger Yasukawa earned the distinction as the first driver in the field. Shortly after, Robby Gordon qualified his car and immediately boarded a plane to Richmond to participate in the NASCAR event that evening. At 3:06 p.m., Dan Wheldon placed himself on the provisional pole position after a qualifying run of 221.524 mph. Several wave offs and two wrecks (Bryan Herta and Felipe Giaffone) characterized the early attempts.\nAt 4:14 p.m., Buddy Rice took over the pole position with a run of 222.024 mph. Rice held off late runs by Dario Franchitti and Tony Kanaan to secure his first Indy 500 pole. At the end of the day, the field was filled to 22 cars.\nSecond Day - Sunday May 16.\nFour cars completed attempts to fill the field to 26 cars. After wrecking the day before, both Bryan Herta and Felipe Giaffone put their cars safely in the field. Herta was the fastest qualifier of the afternoon.\nPractice: week 2.\nWednesday May 19.\nMark Taylor brushed the wall in turn 2, but suffered only minor damage. Scott Dixon led all drivers at 220.576 mph, while Marty Roth was the fastest of the non-qualified cars (212.292 mph).\nThursday May 20.\nA. J. Foyt IV spun in turn 3 and brushed the inside wall, suffering minor damage. Kosuke Matsuura was the fastest of the day (220.784 mph). Marty Roth once again led the non-qualified cars (212.352 mph).\nFriday May 21.\nAdrián Fernández topped the speed chart at 218.257 mph. Meanwhile, Buddy Lazier joined DRR to drive the #24 car (which later became #91 in a joint entry with Hemelgarn). On his first day of track activity, Lazier led non-qualified cars at 215.513 mph.\nSaturday May 22.\nThe final full day of practice saw heavy activity. P. J. Jones took to the track for the first time but only managed 208 mph. Buddy Lazier led the non-qualified car at over 214 mph.\nTime trials - weekend 2.\nBump Day - Sunday May 23.\nThe final day of qualifying saw seven positions open in the field. P. J. Jones was the first car to qualify (213.355 mph), followed by Marty Roth and others. At 1:45 p.m., Greg Ray filled the field to 33 cars with a run of 216.641 mph; the fastest attempt of the afternoon.\nA brief rain shower followed, with Robby McGehee sitting on the bubble as the slowest qualifier (211.631 mph). At that point, it did not appear that any additional drivers would make an attempt to qualify. The only driver left on the sidelines was Jaques Lazier, who briefly practiced during the week for Foyt. However, the ride fizzled. Nevertheless, the track was re-opened after the shower as track crews were able to dry the circuit.\nDuring the afternoon, Tony Stewart visited the track. He was running full-time in NASCAR, and had raced in the NEXTEL All-Star Challenge the night prior. A. J. Foyt reportedly called Stewart while he was at the track and invited him to practice in one of his back-up cars. Stewart quickly passed his physical and went to the pit area to prepare for a possible qualifying attempt. With little else going on during the afternoon, the rumors quickly buzzed around the track and throngs of media surrounded Stewart to cover the breaking story.\nWith about an hour left in the day, a car was prepared for Stewart and fired up on pit lane. Stewart had yet to climb into the car but was suited up in his driving uniform. At 5:36 p.m., however, Stewart left the pits on foot and announced he would not make an attempt to qualify. Stewart's contracts with Joe Gibbs Racing, Home Depot, and Chevrolet precluded him from driving Foyt's Toyota Indy car.\nCarb Day - Thursday May 26.\nThe final practice was held Thursday May 26. Rahal Letterman Racing with driver Buddy Rice and chief mechanic Ricardo Nault won the Checkers/Rally's Pit Stop Challenge\nRace recap.\nStart.\nRain fell early in the morning between 6:00-6:20 a.m. Rain resumed at 9:18 a.m. and continued intermittently until about 10:30 a.m. Track drying efforts began and the start of the race was delayed by a little over two hours. Mari Hulman George gave the traditional command to start engines at 1:02 p.m.\nAt 1:07 p.m., the field pulled away for the pace laps, roughly two hours behind schedule. At the start, Buddy Rice took the lead from the pole position. Rice led Dario Franchitti, Tony Kanaan, Dan Wheldon, and Hélio Castroneves.\nOn lap 10, A. J. Foyt IV brushed the wall in turn four and spun and crashed in turn 1. Foyt was uninjured. Several of the leaders pitted under the caution. Bryan Herta led the field back to green on lap 16. Three laps later, Wheldon took the lead but on lap 22, rain began to fall again and the caution was out again. The field circulated under yellow for several laps and, on lap 28, the red flag came out. Rain was falling hard and the cars were parked in the pits. Many believed the resumption would have to be delayed until Monday.\nRestart.\nThe rain stopped and after a delay of 1 hour and 47 minutes, the track was dry and the race was ready to resume. Robby Gordon, who was attempting to race in both the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600, departed the grounds and flew to Charlotte. Jaques Lazier was standing by, and climbed in the car to drive relief. Lazier became the first relief driver at Indy since 1977. Greg Ray's team was penalized for unapproved work on the car during the red flag. He was sent to the rear of the field for the restart.\nShortly after 3:30 p.m., the green flag came out and race continued. Dan Wheldon led the field, but a couple laps later, Buddy Rice took the lead. An intense segment of racing saw several changes in position amongst the top ten and the leaders racing closely together. On lap 56, Larry Foyt crashed in turn two. The Foyt team would finish 32nd-33rd.\nFirst half.\nBuddy Rice continued to lead during the next stretch of green flag racing. Dan Wheldon and Sam Hornish Jr. ran 2nd-3rd.\nThe third crash of the day involved Ed Carpenter and Mark Taylor on lap 64.\nAs the race approached the halfway point, Rice still led and Wheldon and Hornish continued to battle for 2nd and 3rd. The top five were still within seconds of each other.\nOn lap 94, P. J. Jones made contact with the wall exiting turn 2. Jaques Lazier (driving in relief for Robby Gordon) dropped out with a broken axle. Leader Buddy Rice stalled exiting the pits. Dan Wheldon took over the lead with Hélio Castroneves now second and Rice dropping down to 8th.\nSecond half.\nAs the race completed the 101st lap, it was scored official and would not need to carry over into a second day. On lap 105, Darren Manning and Greg Ray got together, crashing in turn four. They collected Sam Hornish Jr. The three cars slid into the end of the pit wall and came to rest at the entrance of the pits. The green came out on lap 114. Tony Kanaan now led with Rice still mired back in 8th place.\nKanaan and Wheldon traded the lead a couple times over the next several laps. Marty Roth brought out the next caution on lap 131 with a crash in turn four. Buddy Rice worked his way up to 5th place. Most of the leaders pitted on lap 133, but Bruno Junqueira stayed out and cycled up to the lead. Junqueira was gambling that he could outlast the rest of the field on fuel, and be the winner if rain were to return.\nAt lap 150, Bruno Junqueira led Buddy Rice and Tony Kanaan. Junqueira's gamble failed to pay off, and he headed for the pits on lap 151. Rain was approaching, and all of the leaders were going to require one final round of pit stops. The approaching and the pit stop strategy threatened to turn the result into a crap shoot.\nFinish.\nOn lap 160, Buddy Rice led Tony Kanaan and Dan Wheldon. Kanaan was the first of the leaders to pit; he ducked into the pits for tires and fuel on lap 164. Wheldon pitted one lap later on lap 165. Two laps later, Rice was in the pits, handing the lead to Bryan Herta. Rain was fast approaching the Speedway and the race was not expected to reach the full distance before the rain fell. More of the leaders cycled into the pits.\nHerta gave up the lead on lap 169 to pit for fuel. That handed the race lead to Adrián Fernández. Slight moisture was being reported around the track on lap 170, but not enough to bring out a yellow. Fernandez desperately tried to stretch his fuel, but could stay out no longer. Fernandez was forced to pit on lap 171. He made a quick 9-second stop, but lost the lead. After the hectic sequence of pit stops, Buddy Rice was back into the lead.\nWith Buddy Rice, Tony Kanaan second, and Dan Wheldon third, rain started falling on lap 174. The yellow came out with Rice the certain winner. A severe thunderstorm moved into the area and the race was halted after the completion of lap 180 (), just twenty laps short of the scheduled distance. Lightning forced the victory celebration indoors to the Pagoda, and the grandstands were quickly emptied. Rice became the first American winner since Eddie Cheever in 1998. It was also the first rain-shortened 500 since 1976. Honda, which had first arrived at Indianapolis in 1994, scored its long-anticipated first Indy 500 victory.\nAn F2 tornado missed the Speedway and its quarter-million spectators by six miles as it raked across the south central portion of Indianapolis. The tornado caused widespread damage. Precipitation for the day in Indianapolis totaled 3.80 inches; a record single-day amount for that date, and any date during the month since records had been kept.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. Mike King served as chief announcer. Kenny Bräck served as \"driver expert\" up until the rain delay. Bräck sat out the 2004 IndyCar season due to a major crash suffered at Texas in October 2003. This was the only time, other than 2011, that Bräck served as the driver expert on an American broadcast, however, he would serve in later years on international broadcasts.\nDeparting from the broadcast team were two longtime members, Howdy Bell and Chuck Marlowe. Donald Davidson celebrated his 40th year as a member of the crew, while Jerry Baker reached his milestone 30th race.\nKevin Lee moved from turn two to the pit area. Adam Alexander moved from the pits to the turn two location. This was Dave Argabright's first year on the network. This was the last year for both Jim Murphy and Kim Morris.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. The broadcast was billed as the \"Indianapolis 500 Presented by 7-Eleven\". The broadcasting crew moved to a new booth, located in the Pit Road Suites next to the Pagoda. Several innovations were introduced, including the first 180-degree on-board rotating camera, and a Skycam along the mainstretch. The network celebrated its 40th anniversary covering the Indianapolis 500.\nBob Jenkins was released from ABC and ESPN after 2003, and his position as \"host\" was taken by Terry Gannon. Paul Page continued as play-by-play, along with Scott Goodyear. Jack Arute, who had been in the pit area from 1984 to 1998 and 2000-2003, moved into the booth as analyst for the 2004 race. Joining the crew for the first time were Todd Harris and Jamie Little, both as pit reporters.\nDespite a lengthy rain delay throughout the afternoon, ABC stayed on-air all day with coverage, and filled the downtime with highlights and interviews. The marathon broadcast totaled 8 hours and 22 minutes.\nThe introduction, titled \"The Chase\", featuring Henry Rollins, would earn a Sports Emmy nomination for outstanding post produced audio/sound."

        "text": "The 87th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 25, 2003. Two-time defending champion Hélio Castroneves won the pole position and was trying to become the first driver in Indy history to win three in a row. With 31 laps to go, however, Castroneves was passed by his Penske teammate Gil de Ferran, and the duo finished 1st–2nd, with de Ferran winning his first Indy 500. The race was sanctioned by the Indy Racing League and was part of the 2003 IndyCar Series season.\nFor the 2003 season, the series adopted a new chassis package and saw the introduction of Toyota and Honda to the field. It was Honda's third period of involvement at Indy. They partnered with the Judd program in the 1987 race, and was an engine provider in CART in 1990s, entering at Indy in 1994–1995. Toyota, previously an engine provider in CART, however, was making their first-ever trip to Indy.\nDue to cost issues, and a shortage of engines and drivers, there was considerable concern going into the event that the field might fall short of the traditional 33 starters. On the final day of qualifying, the field was filled, avoiding a PR \"black eye\".\nFormer presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton were in attendance, the first time in Indy history that two former presidents were at the race. It was the elder Bush's second visit to the Speedway; he previously presided over the opening ceremonies of the 1987 Pan American Games, which was held at the track. Rookie A. J. Foyt IV, racing on his 19th birthday, became the youngest driver ever to compete in the race.\nFor the first time since the 1970s, the race was not announced as a sell-out. Since 1985, the race was usually sold out by July of the previous year.\nAs of 2020, the 2003 race was the first and only Indy 500 victory for Toyota. It also marked the first Indy 500 win for a Japanese and/or Asian engine manufacturer.\nBackground.\nThe biggest interest story going into the race was the impending retirement of popular veteran Michael Andretti. Andretti announced that the 2003 Indy 500 would be his final race, and that he would retire from driving immediately after, to focus on team ownership. (Note that Andretti came out of retirement and returned to drive at Indy in 2006–2007.)\nDespite the open wheel \"split\" continuing into what was now its eighth season, nearly all of the top CART-based teams entered at Indy for 2003. It was the fourth consecutive year that CART-based teams entered the Indy 500, and each successive year saw an increased number of participants \"crossing over\". The 2003 season was a turning point in the \"split\", as several teams, including Penske, Andretti-Green, Ganassi, and Rahal pulled out of CART and defected permanently to the Indy Racing League on a full-time bases. One of the few holdouts for 2003 was Newman/Haas Racing. Paul Tracy, a key fixture in the controversial 2002 race, also did not enter.\nDuring the spring Dario Franchitti of Andretti-Green Racing was injured in a motorcycle accident, which sidelined him for most of the season. Robby Gordon replaced him in the car at Indy, and Gordon planned to attempt the Indy-Charlotte \"Double Duty\".\nAfter changes in the rules, Greg Ray entered and qualified a car carrying the number 13. It was the first time #13 appeared on a car at the Indy 500 since George Mason in 1914. From 1926 to 2002, usage of #13 was not permitted, and throughout the entire history of the race, was generally avoided by competitors due to superstitions.\nFor the first time ever, a support race was scheduled for the month of May at Indy. The Menards Infiniti Pro Series arrived at the Speedway for the inaugural Freedom 100. The race was scheduled for the Saturday of Bump Day weekend.\nMario Andretti crash.\nAndretti-Green Racing driver, Tony Kanaan, suffered a radial fracture of his arm on April 15 in a crash at Motegi. On April 23, the 1969 Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti took over Kanaan's car for a test session. Andretti retired in 1994, and this was the first time in nine years he had driven a major open-wheel car. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He would then turn the car over to Kanaan on race day. No firm plans had yet been made though for Andretti to actually drive in the race.\nDuring Andretti's test session, it was noted by many observers that despite his lack of experience in modern Indy cars (which had changed substantially since his retirement in 1994) and his advanced age (63), he quickly reached competitive speed. During the morning session, he turned a lap of 212.509 mph, and looked \"as if he had never been away.\" Later in the day, he upped his speed to over 223 mph. The success of the test created a stir, and speculation grew during the afternoon that Andretti may even attempt to qualify for the race.\nWith only two minutes left in the session, Kenny Bräck crashed in turn one, and the yellow light came on. Andretti entered turn one at full speed, and struck debris on the track from Bräck's crash. The object, identified by some as the rear wing, or possibly a piece of foam from the impacted SAFER barrier, pitched the nose of Andretti's car upward, and the car became airborne. The car then went into a rapid double-reverse somersault flip at speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour. Television footage from the WTHR helicopter-cam showed that the car clipped the top of the debris fence, and was nearly high enough to go over it. The car fell back to the racing surface, slowed by its mid-air tumble, and slid to a stop upright. Andretti walked away from the crash with very minor injuries.\nAndretti initially shrugged off the accident, and still contemplated returning to qualify the car in May. A day later, however, he reconsidered.\nPractice and time trials.\nPractice – week 1.\nPractice opened on Sunday May 4, with roughly 29 car/driver combinations named to the field. That was short of the traditional 33 starters for the race, and there was ongoing speculation around the garage area on who would potentially fill the four open spots. At the onset, drivers were flirting with the 230 mph barrier.\nOn Tuesday May 6, rookie Dan Wheldon (231.108 mph) became the first driver to break the 230 mph barrier. A day later, Kenny Bräck (231.039 mph) also broke 231 mph. Wheldon set the fastest lap of the month on Thursday May 8 at 232.202 mph, the fastest lap run at the Speedway since 1996.\nOn \"Fast Friday\" May 9, Arie Luyendyk spun exiting turn one, and hit the outside wall with the back end of the car. The car slid down the track, and hit the outside wall in turn 2 also. Luyendyk suffered a back injury, and soreness in his neck and shoulders. Ultimately, Luyendyk decided to sit out the race, and retired from driving permanently.\nTime trials – Pole Day.\nPole Day was scheduled for Saturday May 10. During the morning practice session Billy Boat spun out of turn four, and made heavy contact with the safety attenuator at the north end of the pit wall. The car hit with the back end, flew up into the air momentarily, and came to rest against the outside wall on the mainstretch. The energy-absorbing barrier was demolished, but officials stated that the barrier withstood the impact, and worked effectively. Boat was transferred to Methodist Hospital for observation, but was eventually released and cleared to drive. By the time that track crews could replace the barrier, rain began to fall. A violent thunderstorm swept through the area, and washed out qualifying for the afternoon.\nPole qualifying was moved to Sunday May 11. The weather was cool and windy. Robbie Buhl was the first car to make an attempt, and he put his car the field with a safe run of 224.369 mph. At 12:30 p.m., rookie Scott Dixon (230.099 mph) was the first car over 230 mph. At 12:45 p.m., Robby Gordon (230.205 mph) took over the provisional pole position.\nAt 12:55 p.m., rookie A. J. Foyt IV was attempting to become the youngest driver ever to qualify for the Indy 500. On his first lap, he spun exiting turn 2, did not hit the wall, and slid backwards down nearly the entire length of the backstretch. He was uninjured.\nThe first trip through the qualifying line was completed at about 1:45 p.m. Several drivers had pulled out of line, waiting for better conditions. At 2:41 p.m., Tony Kanaan took over the top spot with a run of 231.006 mph.\nAt 4:36 p.m., two-time defending race winner Hélio Castroneves (231.725 mph) secured the pole position. Tony Kanaan was bumped to the middle of the front row, and Robby Gordon held on to the outside of the front row. The day ended with A. J. Foyt IV completing a run, and Gil de Ferran, the last car with a realistic shot of the front row, turning in a somewhat-disappointing 228.633 mph, good enough only for 10th starting position.\nPractice – week 2.\nPractice resumed on Wednesday May 14. With nine spots open in the field, unqualified teams began to prepare for the final day of qualifying. Alex Barron was named to replace Arie Luyendyk in the Mo Nunn entry. By Thursday, 32 car/driver combinations had materialized.\nAmong the fastest drivers who had yet to qualify were Jimmy Vasser (228.275 mph) and Alex Barron (227.714 mph). Vasser missed the first weekend of time trials due to his participation in the Champ Car German 500.\nTime trials – Bump Day.\nThe final day of time trials, Sunday, May 18, opened with nine spots open in the field. During the week, there was considerable concern about the prospects of filling the field to the traditional 33 starters. Airton Daré and Vítor Meira were named to rides in the morning, meaning there were then nine cars preparing to qualify.\nTime trials opened at 12:30 p.m., with Jimmy Kite the first car out. After two fast laps, however, the car stalled with an electrical problem. In the first half-hour, three cars qualified, led by Jimmy Vasser, and the field was up to 27 cars.\nJimmy Kite returned to the track, this time qualifying without incident. Airton Daré stalled several times trying to leave the pits, but after repairs, he qualified to fill the field to 29 cars. Just before 2 p.m., Alex Barron and Richie Hearn completed runs, and the field was up to 31 cars. Hearn's team acquired a Penske back-up car, and he was safely in the field.\nAt 3 p.m., there were two spots left in the field. Only two cars remained on the sidelines, Robby McGehee and Vítor Meira. No other teams were planning on qualifying, although a rumor circulated around the garage area that Ganassi was considering on wheeling out a backup car for Jeff Ward. McGehee (224.493 mph) completed his qualifying attempt at 3:30 p.m., leaving only one spot open in the grid. At 4:05 p.m., Meira (227.158 mph) filled the field to 33 cars. At that point, the track was opened for practice, and the track officially closed at 6 o'clock without any other qualifiers.\nThe series avoided the embarrassment of not filling the field to the traditional 33 cars. The race had not failed to do so since 1947, when several drivers that were members of ASPAR (the American Society of Professional Auto Racing) threatened to boycott the race over the purse size. Nonetheless, some members of the media chastised the effort, later nicknaming the afternoon \"Fill Day\" rather than the traditional \"Bump Day\". During the television coverage, Bob Jenkins and Jack Arute passionately defended the event from its detractors. Despite pointing out the lack of drama on the final day of time trials, Robin Miller was among those who suggested that the 2003 field was the deepest talent-wise since the open-wheel \"split\".\nRace summary.\nStart.\nThe controversy of filling the field the previous weekend fizzled as race day arrived. Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines at 10:47 a.m. EST, and all 33 cars pulled away from the starting grid. It would be the final time that the race would begin at the traditional 11 a.m. EST start time.\nPolesitter Hélio Castroneves took the lead at the start, and led for the first 16 laps. The first yellow came out on lap 9 when Billy Boat stalled in turn two. After the restart on lap 15, Sarah Fisher spun in turn three, hitting the outside wall. After pit stops, Scott Dixon took the lead on lap 17.\nFirst half.\nMichael Andretti led 28 laps in the first half, but during a pit stop on lap 98, the car quit with the broken throttle linkage.\nOn lap 61, Richie Hearn got up in the \"marbles\" in turn two, hitting the outside wall. Jaques Lazier spun to avoid the crash and came to rest on the inside of the track. Both drivers were uninjured.\nThe lead changed several times in the first half, with Tomas Scheckter, Tony Kanaan, and Jimmy Vasser each taking turns in the lead. Hélio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran were running in the top 5 most of the way.\nSecond half.\nTomas Scheckter led from laps 101-128, with Hélio Castroneves close behind in second. On lap 127, Airton Dare crashed in turn 2, bringing out the caution, and the leaders all made pit stops. Castroneves beat Scheckter out of the pits and took the lead. Gil de Ferran was in third. On lap 135 restart, de Ferran passed Scheckter for second place.\nAt lap 150, Penske teammates Castroneves and de Ferran were still running 1st–2nd. Castroneves was looking to put himself in position to win his third \"500\" in a row. The leaders made their final pit stops on laps 165–168. After the sequence of green flag stops, Castroneves and de Ferran were again running 1st–2nd.\nOn lap 169, leader Castroneves was hung up behind the lapped car of A. J. Foyt IV down the backstretch. While it was not captured by TV cameras, earlier in the race Foyt had come down and made contact with Castroneves while being lapped in turn 2. This perhaps led to Castroneves following Foyt through the 2nd turn allowing de Ferran to make the pass for the lead going into turn 3.\nOn lap 172, Robby Gordon stopped on the track with a broken gearbox. The yellow came out, but none of the leaders pitted. Gordon immediately departed the grounds, and flew to Charlotte for the Coca-Cola 600.\nWith 25 laps to go, the green came back out with de Ferran leading, and Castroneves in second.\nFinish.\nOn lap 182, Scott Sharp brushed the wall in turn 4, then crashed in turn 1. After the cleanup, the green came back out on lap 186. One lap later, however, Dan Wheldon spun in turn three, hit the outside wall, then the car flipped over and landed upside-down. Wheldon was not injured.\nDuring the caution for the Wheldon crash, Scott Dixon, who was running in the top ten, was weaving back and forth on the mainstretch to warm up his tires. He began to do it too vigorously, and brushed the inside wall. The car was too damaged to continue.\nThe green came out with six laps to go. Gil de Ferran held off Hélio Castroneves by 0.2290 seconds to win his first Indianapolis 500. After the race, Castroneves coaxed de Ferran to climb the catch fence on the mainstretch, mimicking his own traditional post-race victory celebration. de Ferran ended up retiring at season's end, becoming the fourth Indy 500 winner to retire as a reigning \"500\" champion.\nThe \"curse of the Indy three-peat\" prevailed again as Castroneves failed to achieve victory. His three-race career record of 1st–1st–2nd, however, established an Indy record for a driver's first three starts. Castroneves' second place tied Al Unser's 1970–1971–1972 effort of 1st–1st–2nd.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indy Racing Radio Network. Mike King served as chief announcer. The booth crew had a new look for 2003. Longtime driver expert Johnny Rutherford left the crew to take over the position of pace car driver during caution periods. Joining King in the booth were two newcomers, Dave Wilson who served as color commentator, and new \"driver expert\" Davey Hamilton. Hamilton was on a hiatus from driving after his serious crash at Texas in 2001. The broadcast was heard on 555 affiliates.\nThe 2003 race saw all four turn reporters return to their assigned posts from the previous year. The three pit reporters remained the same, although they swapped their locations along pit road. The 2003 race would be the final 500 on the radio for longtime members Howdy Bell and Chuck Marlowe. Bell once again had the limited role of reporting from the track hospital, while Marlowe covered the garage area as he had since 1989.\nSponsor guests interviewed in the booth included Tim Manganello (BorgWarner), Keith Sirios (Checkers and Rally's), and Chevrolet pace car driver Herb Fishel. Other guests interviewed in the pits included Jim Campbell (Chevrolet) and Wynonna Judd.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. The on-air crew remained the same from the previous year, with Bob Jenkins returning as host, and Paul Page handling the play-by-play duties. It would ultimately be the final 500 on television for Bob Jenkins.\nFor the first time, the race broadcast featured a presenting sponsor. The race was billed as the \"Indianapolis 500 Presented by 7-Eleven\". The crew called the race for the final time from the booth on top of the Paddock grandstand, for starting in 2004, they would move to the newer television studio inside the Pagoda.\nControversy.\nOn Sunday May 18, the final day of time trials, when there was some question of whether the field would be filled to the traditional 33 cars, television reporters Bob Jenkins and Jack Arute passionately defended the event from its detractors on air. Afterwards, Jenkins received criticism, mostly for a lack of journalistic professionalism and objectivity. His statements were considered biased in favor of the IRL/IMS, and that he allowed his personal opinions enter his reporting.\nDuring ABC coverage of time trials, Vítor Meira filled the field to 33 cars. Arute opened his interview with Meira at 5:17 p.m. EDT by stating:\nA minute later, Jenkins replied with:\nAs the day was coming to a close, the television coverage switched to ESPN for the final hour. Jenkins closed the broadcast with the following commentary at 6:56 p.m. EDT:\nA minute later, Arute followed:\nJenkins was released from ABC/ESPN at the end of the 2003 season. After a very brief stint covering CART on Spike TV in 2004, and after a single race at ESPN in 2008, he joined Versus (now known as the NBC Sports Network) in 2009. It was never announced if the on-air comments were a factor in his release, and Jenkins contends he was never informed if that was the case. Following the 2012 season, Jenkins reduced his schedule to a reserve role that includes Carb Day coverage."

        "text": "The 86th Indianapolis race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 26, 2002. It was the seventh Indianapolis 500 held as part of the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series schedule, and was part of the 2002 Indy Racing League season.\nRookie Tomas Scheckter led 85 laps, and appeared on his way to a possible victory, which would have marked the third consecutive Indy win for a first-year driver. However, Scheckter crashed on the front stretch while leading with only 27 laps to go. Hélio Castroneves, who also won the 2001 running became the fifth driver in Indy 500 history to win back-to-back races. It was his second of four Indy 500 victories. It is largely considered one of the most controversial races in Indy history.\nOn the 199th lap, second place Paul Tracy was alongside leader Hélio Castroneves, going for the lead in the third turn. At the same time, a crash occurred on another part of the track, bringing out the caution flag. Indy Racing League officials ruled that the yellow came out before Tracy completed the pass, and Castroneves was declared the victor. After an official protest was filed, and after an appeals hearing, Castroneves' victory was upheld on July 2, 2002.\nAbout 7.46 inches of rain fell during the month of May, considerably interrupting the on-track activities. The second day of time trials was completely washed out, while Bump Day was cut short due to rain. Likewise, six of the ten practice days were either delayed by moisture or halted due to rain showers. Uncomfortably cold temperatures also were observed during most of the month. Private testing and rookie orientation in April was also hampered several times due to rain and cold temperatures. Race day, however, was sunny, warm, and clear.\nBackground.\nDuring the off-season, several CART teams again committed to entries in the IRL-sanctioned Indy 500 for 2002. Penske Racing, Chip Ganassi Racing, and Team Green all announced they would return from 2001. Rahal Letterman Racing also announced they would join the CART teams and cross party lines to race at Indy. Due to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, Team Green announced that they would not have primary sponsor KOOL, but their cars would carry the colors of associate sponsor 7-Eleven.\nRobby Gordon announced on March 28 that he would attempt \"double duty\" for 2002 by racing in the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on the same day. Tony Stewart, who attempted the feat in 1999 and 2001, announced he would not do so for 2002. John Andretti, who did so in 1994, also announced he would not attempt the double.\nDuring the spring, the asphalt pavement at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway underwent a diamond grinding in an effort to smooth out several bumps. In April, the new SAFER barrier was retrofitted to the retaining walls in the turns at the Speedway. It marked the first installation of the revolutionary-new energy-absorbing technology at an American superspeedway.\nRule changes.\nFor the 2002 race, all pit crew members that work over the wall must wear approved helmets. This requirement was in response to a succession of accidents and injuries (particularly head injuries) involving pit crew members in series sanctioned by members of ACCUS (NASCAR, IMSA, SCCA, NHRA, CART, IRL). Many pit crews in the series had already been utilizing optional helmets since about 1999, after Steve Fried, the crew chief for Robby McGehee was critically injured in a pit accident. The accident put Freid in a coma for several weeks.\nPrior to 2002, it was only required that the crew member operating the fuel rig was to wear a helmet. It was to protect from fire in case of a fuel spill, and protect him in case he lost his balance. His position between the front and rear axles was deemed particularly precarious. The tire changers did not wear helmets, despite the fact that they were more exposed and vulnerable to injury from other cars entering and exiting the pit lane.\nThe standardized font car numbers (black numerals on a white box) used from 1999 to 2001 were scrapped. Teams were permitted to utilize any color/font for car numbers decals, provided they were sufficiently visible. Car number decal placement locations were also adjusted. The required car number locations were to be one on the nose, and one on each of the rear wing vertical panels (right &amp; left).\nPractice and time trials.\nPractice – week 1.\nOn opening day, Robby McGehee became the first driver to crash into the newly installed SAFER barrier. Scott Sharp and Hélio Castroneves led the speed chart.\nDuring the first week of practice, rain delayed the start of track activity on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Several hours of practice time were lost, with over of rain falling in those four days.\nCrashes involving P. J. Jones, Mark Dismore, Max Papis, and Alex Barron occurred during the first week. During practice on the morning of pole day, Paul Tracy suffered a major accident in turn 2, demolishing his lone car. Without a backup car, the team was forced to make repairs.\nThe top of the speed chart changed widely over each day, with no driver atop the leaderboard more than twice all month. Speeds flirted with the barrier for the first time since 1996. Bruno Junqueira finally cracked around 3:30 p.m. on Friday May 10.\nPole Day time trials – Saturday May 11.\nThree days of time trials were scheduled for 2002. On pole day May 11, Bruno Junqueira was the first car to make a qualifying attempt. He finished at , the fastest pole speed since 1996. His speed held up all afternoon, and he secured his first Indy 500 pole position. He was also the first driver since Emerson Fittipaldi in 1990 to win the pole after qualifying as the coveted \"first in the field.\" The front row was rounded out by IRL-regular Robbie Buhl, and Raul Boesel in the Team Menard car.\nDefending champion Hélio Castroneves managed only 13th starting position, while veteran Michael Andretti was the second slowest of the day at .\nThe second day of time trials, scheduled for May 12, was rained out. All remaining time trials were shifted to bump day, May 19.\nPractice – week 2.\nDuring the second week of practice, three additional days were delayed or halted by rain. Paul Tracy returned to the track late in the week, in preparation to qualify on the second weekend.\nBump Day time trials – Sunday May 19.\nOn bump day, nine spots remained open in the field. Rain delayed the start by over an hour, but several cars lined up to make attempts. The field filled to 33 cars just before 2 p.m., with Billy Roe on the bubble. With light rain threatening, George Mack bumped Roe out of the field at 2:35 p.m. In doing so, he became the second African American driver (following Willy T. Ribbs) to qualify for the Indy 500.\nWith some cars practicing and preparing to enter the qualifying line, Team Green withdrew the slow time previously put in by Michael Andretti. The move momentarily reinstated Roe to the field. Andretti's speed greatly improved from the previous weekend, and he safely bumped his way back into the field. With Billy Boat on the bubble, rain stopped qualifying at 3:40 p.m., and it was eventually ended at 4:51 p.m. Jimmy Kite and Donnie Beechler were left waiting in the qualifying line.\nCarb Day.\nOn Thursday May 23, the final practice session was held. Indy rookie Tony Kanaan led the speed chart at . All 33 starters took laps without incident. Later in the afternoon, Penske Racing with driver Hélio Castroneves won the Coors Indy 500 Pit Stop Challenge. They defeated Chip Ganassi Racing and driver Jeff Ward in the final round.\nRace running.\nStart.\nAfter a month plagued by constant rain, race day saw clear blue skies and temperatures in the mid 70s (°F). Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines at 10:52 a.m. EST, and all cars pulled away behind the 50th Anniversary Chevrolet Corvette pace car.\nAt the start, polesitter Bruno Junqueira took the lead and led the first 32 laps. A record-setting pace early on saw 29 laps completed before the first yellow. Greg Ray brought out the first caution with a crash in turn 1 Junqueira and the rest of the leaders pitted, but he stalled exiting the pits, giving the lead over to rookie Tomas Scheckter.\nMid race.\nA sequence of pit stops around the 65th lap shuffled the leaderboard. Indy rookie Tony Kanaan took over the lead on lap 70. On lap 78, Sam Hornish Jr. brushed the wall, damaging his suspension. He drove the car to the pits for repairs. Three laps later, while the leaders pitted, fifth place Robby Gordon suffered a large fire and explosion in his pit stall. The explosion blew the top off the pit-side fuel tank. Gordon was uninjured, and the car was able to continue.\nOn lap 90, with Kanaan still leading, Jimmy Vasser and Bruno Junqueira both slowed with mechanical problems. An oil leak on the track went unnoticed, and leader Kanaan spun in the oil, crashing into turn 3. Rick Treadway also became involved in the incident.\nScheckter resumed the lead after Kanaan dropped out. Meanwhile, Sam Hornish Jr. returned to the track, albeit several laps down.\nSecond half.\nWith as many as 13 cars on the lead lap, a very long stretch of green flag racing commenced. Two sequences of green-flag pit stops shuffled the lead among Gil de Ferran, Scott Sharp, Felipe Giaffone, and Alex Barron. However, Scheckter still found himself back into the lead by lap 166. With 30 laps to go, Scheckter held an 8.3-second lead over Paul Tracy.\nFinish.\nOn lap 173, after leading 85 laps during the race, leader Tomas Scheckter slid high in turn four and crashed against the wall down the frontstretch. Under the yellow, the leaders pitted. Exiting the pits, Gil de Ferran lost a wheel that was not secured, and fell out of contention. Gambling on fuel, Hélio Castroneves stayed out and took over the lead.\nOn lap 181, the green flag came back out with Castroneves leading, and Felipe Giaffone running second. The lapped car of Dario Franchitti slipped by to get in front of the field. Franchitti's car was painted nearly identical to Tracy's, and caused some confusion/misidentification by announcers. With ten laps to go, Castroneves still led Giaffone, with Paul Tracy charging into third. Castroneves was starting to run low on fuel, and his pace started to slow. Giaffone closed within a half-second.\nWith less than 3 laps to go, Giaffone dove below Castroneves, attempting to take the lead. The lapped car of Franchitti pulled alongside Castroneves, effectively blocking Giaffone. Castroneves held off the challenge, and third place Paul Tracy managed to move past Giaffone for second. Giaffone later complained that Franchitti was unfairly blocking to help his teammate Tracy. With 2 laps to go, Castroneves led Tracy by only 0.22 seconds at the start/finish line. Down the backstretch, Tracy started to move to the outside, in an attempt to make a pass for the lead. While they were approaching turn 3, a crash occurred on a different part of the track.\nThe lapped car of rookie Laurent Redon got loose in turn 1, allowing Buddy Lazier (running in 8th place) to dive below him in turn 2. Redon came down on Lazier, the two cars touched, and both crashed hard into the outside wall exiting turn 2. At the same time the crash occurred in turn 2, Tracy and Castroneves were almost side-by-side in turn three. A yellow flag came out for the crash, and Tracy completed the pass. Castroneves backed off the throttle, which allowed Giaffone to pass him, as well as the lapped car of Sam Hornish Jr. Many believed at the time that Castroneves had run out of fuel, or was nearly out of fuel, and thought that was the reason he suddenly had slowed down. Castroneves claims that he saw the yellow light illuminate on his dashboard, and thinking at first it was the fuel light, and he reacted by letting off.\nBelieving he had just taken the lead with one lap to go, Tracy proclaimed on his two-way radio \"Yeah baby!\". Barry Green soon responded \"there's a problem.\" Officials in race control, led by Brian Barnhart, stated that Castroneves was the leader.\nOn the final lap, Tracy, Giaffone, and the lapped car of Hornish, had broken away, and crossed the finish line approximately 19 seconds before the rest of the field. The Corvette pace car, was in turn 4, and was not able to enter the track and pack up the field. At a slowed pace, and running low on fuel, Castroneves, with the lapped car of Dario Franchitti immediately behind him (in a car painted nearly identical to Tracy's) took the checkered flag as the winner. Tracy and Giaffone completed an additional lap, and were scored by the computer unofficially as second (82.8341 seconds behind) and third (85.6007 second behind) respectively. Their completion of lap 200 was ignored by the scoring system, and their completion of lap 201 was scored for their finish. Castroneves then drove to the frontstretch, jumped out of his car, and climbed the catch fence just as he did a year earlier in 2001.\nDespite the concern for fuel, and after running 42 laps since his last pit stop, Castroneves completed his victory lap, and had 1 gallon of fuel remaining in the tank.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nControversy.\nInitial confusion.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the race, confusion reigned among the competitors, broadcasters, and fans. Brian Barnhart, in Race Control, made the initial call at the moment, stating \"yellow, yellow, yellow, three is your leader\" (\"three\" being Castroneves car number) over the director's radio channel, and such was repeated by his assistant Mel Harder over the teams' race control radio channel. Harder was in charge of activating the yellow lights around the track, and the in-car dashboard yellow light system.\nOn the television broadcast, commentator Paul Page erroneously stated that Castroneves was the leader because the scoring \"reverted back to the previous lap.\" Such rules are used if electronic transponder-based scoring with multiple timing loops was not used, as in the past, but since the advent of transponder-based scoring, the rule has generally been instead of the last completed lap, but the last timing loop the car crossed at the point of caution. Page also, on at least one occasion, misidentified Dario Franchitti's car as that of Tracy's (the two cars had identical liveries). ABC waited over 14 minutes before they showed a replay of the pass or the crash. However, ABC did air split-screen footage clearly showing the crash occurred before the pass. The footage, however, did not show conclusive evidence of when the yellow light came on. However, TV analyst Scott Goodyear was convinced that Helio won the race, referencing his loss of the 500 in 1995 where he figured out that post-race appeals were rarely accepted.\nOn the live radio broadcast Mike King announced that \"race control said the pass would not count.\" Donald Davidson echoed the same erroneous information that the scoring reverted to the previous lap (though it was last completed loop prior to caution), and added that the cars did not race back to the yellow, as was the policy in NASCAR at the time (the rule was changed in September 2003, when the practice was banned and scoring reverts to the last scoring loop crossed before the caution was called, except in the final lap or a caution that ends a race because of weather or darkness, when it reverts to video replays). A similar controversy took place at the 2019 INDYCAR Portland road course event at the start when a massive crash at the opening chicane caused 11 laps of caution as officials could not determine positions based on video evidence. Officials decided for the 2020 season that scoring reverts to the last loop crossed when a caution occurs. \nIn the pits, Barry Green immediately challenged the decision. He told Tracy over the two-way radio that there was \"a problem,\" and later chimed sarcastically that \"\"they\" (presumably IRL officials) are not going to let one of \"us\" (one of the CART teams) win.\" He contended that Tracy said he had completed the pass before the yellow caution light came on. Tracy said \"I feel that I was ahead of him when it went yellow. I passed him, and I saw green. We're going to protest this thing because I was ahead of him when the yellow came out.\" \nMeanwhile, Castroneves stated the yellow had come out before the pass was made. \"The only reason he passed me, it's because the yellow came on, and I lifted off. I cannot feel sorry for Paul Tracy.\" Other drivers had different opinion. Eddie Cheever called the finish \"confusing.\" Dario Franchitti, Tracy's teammate, said that \"Paul (Tracy) had passed (Castroneves) on the outside before the yellow came out.\" Mario Andretti, however, spoke with Tracy after the race, and said that Tracy was \"more concerned with keeping an eye on Castroneves' car\" than watching the yellow lights.\nProtest.\nOfficial results were posted five hours after the race, with Castroneves declared the winner and Paul Tracy second. As the cars did not cross the finish line in order, the standings were amended so that Tracy's finishing time was scored as a fraction of a second behind that of Castroneves. Team Green immediately filed a protest, and the hearing was scheduled for May 27 at 10:00 a.m. During the two-hour hearing, Brian Barnhart and Indy Racing League officials denied the protest and presented their conclusions. Officials determined that Castroneves was indisputably the leader under the following relevant times:\nIn rejecting the protest, Barnhart stated that \"Team Green did not present anything that was conclusive enough in any way, shape or form to change our mind.\"\nAppeals hearing.\nTeam Green submitted a written appeal of the protest decision on June 3. A closed-door appeals hearing was scheduled for June 17. Speedway President Tony George presided over the hearing, with Indianapolis attorney Dave Mittingly assisting. Both Team Green and Penske Racing presented evidence, and several persons involved provided testimony. Among those who gave testimony were Tracy, Castroneves, Sam Hornish Jr., Dario Franchitti, Brian Barnhart (race control), Doug Boles (spotter in turn three for Hornish Jr.), and Jeff Horton (IRL Director of Engineering).\nThe basis of Team Green's argument was that Tracy was the leader when the yellow lights around the track came on, and that those lights should control. While they acknowledged that Castroneves was leading at the time Barnhart called for the yellow, they argued it was irrelevant unless the yellow lights were on. They also did not dispute that it was possible that the dashboard yellow lights on Castroneves' car came on while Castroneves was still leading. They cited the inconsistencies of the dashboard system from car to car, and claimed the dashboard lights had not come on in Tracy's car until after he had made the pass.\nPenske Racing's primary defense concentrated on their interpretations of the IRL rulebook. They stated that at the commencement of a yellow caution period, the positioning of the cars is a judgement call made quickly by the officials. They also stated that the ruling of a car passing another car under a caution period is specifically listed as not protestable or appealable under the existing rules.\nOn July 2, 2002, Tony George issued an 18-page decision on the appeal. He upheld the victory of Hélio Castroneves, and denied Team Green's appeal. In his decision, George stated that \"Clearly Helio (Castroneves) was in front when the call (for the yellow) was made\" and that several of the caution signals, including trackside and dashboard lights, a radio announcement and a flag closing the pits, were displayed before Tracy's pass. George also accepted Penske's arguments that, even if Tracy was ahead before the caution, the decision to call Castroneves the leader was an unappealable judgment call.\nAftermath.\nAfter the decision was rendered, the reaction among fans, media, and competitors was split largely along party lines. CART supporters generally sided with Team Green and Paul Tracy denouncing the decision, while IRL supporters generally accepted the final result. Many Tracy supporters felt the decision was politically motivated, suggesting that Tony George favored Penske Racing (a full-time IRL team) and punished the part-time, rival CART-based effort of Team Green. The controversy was divisive, and worked to reopen wounds from the 1996 open wheel split. Robin Miller openly criticized the decision, and considered Tracy \"the unofficial 2002 Indy winner.\" The day after the race, he presented video footage on \"RPM 2Night\", which he claimed showed evidence the pass was completed under green. Shirts and hats were sold at CART events declaring Tracy the \"Real IRL 500 winner\", which Tracy would be seen publicly wearing at times.\nWith Tracy officially relegated to second finishing position, he ultimately failed to break a 91-year-old record that dated back to the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911. Tracy had started 29th, and had he won the race, would have set the record for the lowest starting position by the race winner. It also would have been a post-WWII record for lowest starting position for a winner in any Indy car race. The all-time record was set by Ray Harroun in 1911 (and subsequently tied by Louis Meyer in 1936) by winning the Indianapolis 500 from the 28th starting position. Tracy also missed out on matching the record of fewest laps led by an Indy 500 champion, as he would have led only the final two laps of the race (the previous fewest was in 1912 with only 2 laps led); Dan Wheldon would take the record in 2011 with only one lap led.\nStarting with the next IndyCar Series telecast, ABC/ESPN experimented with a new on-screen graphic displaying a yellow banner or yellow symbol the instant a caution period commenced. The system was tied to official race control, and was utilized to avoid confusion about yellow-light conditions, similar to the graphic that had been deployed by Fox, FX, NBC, and TNT for their NASCAR telecasts beginning in 2001.\nA few weeks after the decision, Barry Green announced he was selling his share of Team Green to Michael Andretti, and would be taking a sabbatical from the sport. He reportedly had spent over $100,000 on legal expenses. Paul Tracy finished out a mediocre CART season with Green, and left the team at season's end. He won one race, and was voted the 2002 CART Most Popular Driver. During his acceptance speech, he thanked Tony George for helping him win the award, and added that the dispute strengthened his fanbase. \"Since that whole disaster, I've become a fan favorite. I guess this is like my Borg-Warner Trophy.\"\nWith CART facing financial trouble at season's end, Michael Andretti took the team, then called Andretti Green Racing and now Andretti Autosport, full-time to the IndyCar Series for 2003. Andretti Autosport has since scored five Indianapolis 500 wins -- 2005, 2007, 2014, 2016, and 2017. Andretti also is a partner in Bryan Herta Autosport in the 2016 race that team won.\nTracy, angered by the loss, refused to return to the IRL and the Indy 500 in subsequent seasons. On September 23, 2003, when asked if he were interested in driving in the IRL in 2004, he responded \"I'm not driving one of those crapwagons.\" The quote took on a life of its own, and was adopted as a political slogan and battle cry for IRL detractors for years to come. Under the profile section Tracy's official web site (PaulTracy.com) career highlights include \"2002 Indy 500 Runner Up (yeah right).\" Tracy continued in the Champ Car series, finally winning a season title in 2003, although it came after most of the top teams had already defected to the IRL. He eventually left the series, and had a short stint in the NASCAR Busch Series. In the wake of the 2008 open wheel unification, Tony George himself reportedly offered Tracy a ride with Vision Racing. Tracy initially declined, musing that \"I'm not going to drive for hamburgers and hot dogs.\" In July 2008, Tracy finally crossed lines and signed with Vision Racing to drive in the Edmonton Indy. He then made a highly publicized return at the 2009 Indianapolis 500, and was previously with NBC Sports as one of the network's INDYCAR broadcasters until he left at the end of the 2021 season.\nINDYCAR played off the controversy when Tracy won at the Speedway in 2016 at the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational Pro-Am, a race featuring amateur drivers paired with Indianapolis Motor Speedway racers, with the headline \"Tracy finally gets to drink milk\" upon his first career win at the Speedway.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indy Racing Radio Network. The network celebrated its 50th anniversary covering the Indianapolis 500. Mike King served as chief announcer. Johnny Rutherford served as \"driver expert\" for the 13th and final time.\nThe 2002 race saw all four turn reporters return to their assigned posts from the previous year. Kim Morris and Adam Alexander returned as pit reporters, but Mike Lewis departed and newcomer Jim Murphy took his place.\nGuests in the booth included Kurt Ritter (Chevrolet), John F. Fielder (BorgWarner), and pace car driver Jim Caviezel.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. ABC and ESPN had reorganized their broadcasting duties, and eliminated coverage of the CART series. Therefore, Paul Page, who had worked CART races since 1999, was moved back full-time to the IRL and Indy 500. Page was named announcer, while Bob Jenkins was shifted to the \"host\" position. Recently retired driver Scott Goodyear joined the booth as analyst.\nGone from the broadcast were Al Michaels and Leslie Gudel, but returning was Gary Gerould."

        "text": "The 85th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 27, 2001. Race rookie Hélio Castroneves, a three-year veteran of the CART series, led the final 52 laps and won his first of four Indy 500 victories. Team Penske swept 1st-2nd with Gil de Ferran finishing as the runner-up. Winning car owner Roger Penske scored his eleventh victory at the Indianapolis 500, and notched his first-ever 1-2 finish in the race. It was a redemption from the team's previous attempt at Indy (1995) in which both of his cars failed to qualify. Team Penske did not compete at Indianapolis from 1996 to 2000 due to the ongoing open wheel \"Split\".\nThe race was sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, and was part of the 2001 Indy Racing Northern Lights Series season. The 2001 race was notable in that several top CART teams returned to Indy for the first time since 1995. IRL-based teams excelled in time trials, taking the front row, and the top four starting positions overall. However, the CART-based teams swept the top six finishing positions on race day. Former IRL champion Tony Stewart (who was competing full-time in NASCAR), returned to Indy after a missing the 2000 race. Stewart raced \"Double Duty\", becoming the first driver in history to complete all 1,100 miles. He finished 6th at Indy, and 3rd at the Coca-Cola 600.\nThe race experienced two rain delays, one lengthy yellow flag around the midway point, and one brief red flag period later in the day. The race, however, was run to its full 500-mile distance.\nThis race marked the final IndyCar start for the previous year's championship runner-up, and two-time Indy 500 runner-up Scott Goodyear. Goodyear suffered an injury in a crash, and retired from racing. He would move to color commentary duties for ESPN the following season. \nRace background.\nIn the seventh year of the ongoing IRL/CART split, Team Penske and Team Green purchased IRL-type machines, and returned to race at Indianapolis. Ganassi, who had returned in 2000, entered as well. For the first time during the open wheel split, the CART series did not schedule any races for the weekend of Indy 500 pole qualifying, nor the race itself, to allow their teams the opportunity to participate at Indy without interference.\nBecause of his move to Formula One for the 2001 season, reigning Indianapolis 500 champion Juan Pablo Montoya did not return to defend his title. Montoya would not race in the Indy 500 again until 2014. After one year of retirement, two-time Indy winner Arie Luyendyk returned to the cockpit.\nAfter an experimental two-week schedule was used for the Indy 500 from 1998 to 2000, the Speedway reverted to the more traditional three-week schedule for practice, time trials, and the race. Rookie orientation was held April 13–14. Time trials were set at three days, however, instead of the original four. The week-long open test held in April from 1998 to 2000 was also eliminated, essentially replaced by the reinstatement of the second week of May practice.\nDue to the MSA, tobacco brand sponsorship became an issue during the month of May. Team Penske drivers Hélio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran were sponsored by Marlboro full-time in the CART. The MSA, however, allowed brand sponsorship in only one sport per season. To skirt the regulations, CART sanctioned the participation of its teams in the race. The Penske cars practiced and qualified with Marlboro logos during the first week of activity. By mid-month, however, they were required to remove the logos when the state attorney general's office objected to their use. Rather than repaint the liveries, or add generic logos (such as the familiar Marlboro \"barcode\" insignia), the sidepods were simply left blank; the familiar white/red Marlboro paint scheme was maintained.\nRule changes.\nDuring yellow flag caution periods, the \"wave around\" rule would now be employed. When the field is one lap away from going back to green flag conditions, all lapped cars behind the pace car that happen to be ahead of the actual race leader would be \"waved around\" the pace car, get their lap back, and be permitted to catch up to the tail end of the line of cars. This would continue until the race leader became the first car behind the pace car. Following the precedent set in 2000, the pace car would then drop off the track in turn one, and the race leader would pace the field back to the green flag and the ensuring restart.\nThe new restart rules were an attempt to ensure the leaders would get back to green flag racing without interference from lapped cars. It also created a strategy for lapped cars to earn one lap back (ostensibly by not pitting under a caution flag while all of the leader do), since Indy car racing had never allowed \"racing back to the caution\", nor did they want to implement a hard rule like the \"Lucky Dog\" in NASCAR.\nPractice.\nIRL regular Greg Ray led practice speeds for four of the first six days. Casey Mears, Eliseo Salazar, and Stan Wattles suffered crashes during the week. On Fast Friday, Indy 500 rookie Hélio Castroneves brushed the wall in turn one, but continued. The car suffered minor damage. Later that evening, Castroneves joked around with track workers, and helped them repaint the retaining wall which he had hit.\nTime trials.\nTony Stewart led the speed chart for morning practice on pole day, but IRL regular Scott Sharp won the battle for the pole position with a run above 226MPH in the heat of the day. Greg Ray, who had been among the fastest cars all week, qualified second with a run late after waving off earlier in the day while Robby Gordon, driving an Indy-only entry for AJ Foyt Racing, rounded out the front row. The highest of the CART qualifiers was Gil de Ferran (5th). Former Indy 500 winners Arie Luyendyk, Buddy Lazier, Al Unser Jr., and Eddie Cheever also made the field on pole day. At the end of pole day the field was filled to 27 cars.\nOn the second day of qualifying, veterans Michael Andretti, Eddie Cheever, and Buzz Calkins withdrew their slow times from pole day and re-qualified safely while rookie Bruno Junqueira was the fastest of the day. At the end of second day qualifying there were 32 cars in the field.\nOn bump day, Billy Boat was the first car to complete a qualifying attempt, and the field was subsequently filled to 33 cars. Six cars were bumped during the afternoon, and Boat dropped to the bubble spot as of 5:07 p.m. Over the final 53 minutes Boat survived 12 attempts to be bumped from the field. Eight cars waved off, and four were too slow. With 10 seconds to go before the 6 o'clock gun, Memo Gidley was the final driver to make a qualifying attempt. He missed bumping his way into the field by 0.242 seconds.\nRace recap.\nStart.\nRace morning was overcast with rain in the forecast. Cool temperatures caused problems at the start, as pole sitter Scott Sharp crashed in the first turn on the first lap. Greg Ray and Robby Gordon barely avoided the crash, and slipped by the lead the field around for the first several laps.\nOn the 6th lap, the green came out, but less than 2 laps later, another crash occurred. Sarah Fisher spun in turn two, and collected Scott Goodyear. Both cars were heavily damaged, and Goodyear suffered a broken back. Goodyear would retire after the race due to the injury.\nAfter a lengthy yellow, the green came out on lap 17. During the restart, however, cold tires caused yet another crash, as Sam Hornish Jr. spun in turn four. Hornish did not hit anything, but Al Unser Jr. moved high to avoid the crash, and brushed along the outside wall on the main stretch.\nFirst half and First rain delay.\nThe race finally got going on lap 22, with Robby Gordon and Greg Ray dominating the early going. A long stretch of green flag racing saw the leaders cycle through two green flag pit stops.\nOn lap 107, Jon Herb crashed in turn 1. During the yellow, rain began to fall around the track, and the caution was extended until lap 119. Michael Andretti led when the rain fell, but pitted soon after. Gil de Ferran inherited the lead, Team Penske teammate Hélio Castroneves second.\nSecond half and Second rain delay.\nOn lap 134, Cory Witherill spun exiting turn four. The leaders all headed to the pits. \nCastroneves and de Ferran were both penalized for exiting out of the pits incorrectly, giving Tony Stewart the lead for the first time of the day.\nStewart led until rain fell again on lap 149. After Stewart pitted, Hélio Castroneves retook the lead. Rain began falling harder on lap 155, and the red flag was displayed. After about 10 minutes, the sun came out, and the track quickly dried. After a 17-minute red flag, the cars were refired.\nFinish.\nHélio Castroneves led Robbie Buhl on the restart. Buhl attempted to take the lead on lap 159, but was blocked. Trailing by less than a half-second on lap 166, Buhl suddenly spun exiting turn 2, and tapped the inside wall.\nThe green came back out on lap 171, with Castroneves still leading, and de Ferran back to second. Castroneves held off his teammate by 0.4838 seconds, and won his first Indy 500. The finish marked Roger Penske's 11th Indy 500 triumph, and his first 1-2 finish. It was the second rookie winner in a row (following Juan Pablo Montoya in 2000).\nOn the victory lap, Castroneves stopped at the finish line, climbed from his car, and proceeded to engage in his customary celebration of climbing the catch fence, much to the delight of the fans. Several crew members from Team Penske joined him on the fence.\nIn a public relations setback for the IRL, the top six finishers were all visiting drivers from the rival CART series. The first regular IRL series driver to finish was Eliseo Salazar in seventh place, running a lap down.\nScott Sharp's crash on the first lap meant for the second year in a row, the pole sitter finished 33rd and last. In the previous year's race, the same fate had befallen Greg Ray.\nThe 1-2 result for Team Penske provided a stunning comeback for the most successful team in Indianapolis 500 history after their failure to qualify for the 1995 race, the last Indy 500 entered by Team Penske due to the Indy 500 becoming an IRL race from 1996 onward. \"I think we redeemed ourselves for the lousy thing we did in 1995 ... this is the best day of my life coming back like this\" said Roger Penske in pit lane immediately after Castroneves took the checkered flag.\nTony Stewart does Double Duty.\nTony Stewart attempted the Indy/Charlotte \"Double Duty\" for the second time in his racing career. Criticized by members of the media as being overweight and unfit for the grueling task, Stewart undertook a month-long fitness and dietary program with a personal trainer. Stewart, still driving the #20 The Home Depot-sponsored Pontiac for Joe Gibbs Racing in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, signed with Chip Ganassi Racing, part of a four driver effort at Indy.\nStewart qualified in 7th at Indy and 12th at Charlotte. Due to the new television package on Fox, the start of the Coca-Cola 600 was moved up. A strict schedule was put into place, and regardless if the race was not over at Indy, Stewart was allegedly required to get out of the car at 4:00 p.m. to fly to Charlotte on time. During a 17-minute red flag, he had to visit first aid for a cramping leg. Relief driver Richie Hearn almost took over, but Stewart got back in the car.\nThe race was eventually resumed, and Stewart continued. The race was completed, and he finished 6th, on the lead lap. Immediately he flew to Lowe's Motor Speedway, and made the start of the race on time. He was moved to the back of the pack during the pace lap for missing the drivers' meeting. On the second lap, Stewart spun while running last, in an incident he claimed was unrelated to fatigue. As the race wore on, he steadily climbed the standings, and finished 3rd on the lead lap. He became the first and still only driver ever to complete all . Feeling that he proved his critics wrong, Stewart called them \"idiots\".\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nNational anthem controversy.\nFor the pre-race ceremonies, the Speedway invited Steven Tyler of Aerosmith to perform \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". At the time, Aerosmith was kicking off their Just Push Play Tour, and in the days leading up to the race, struck a deal with Heritage Motorsports to sponsor Jeff Ward's car during the race. The performance was widely regarded by observers as one of the worst and most controversial renditions of the U.S. national anthem ever.\nThe national anthem performer at the Indianapolis 500 is normally backed-up by the Purdue All-American Marching Band; however, the band was only allowed to play the opening chorus. Tyler began the song with a harmonica solo, then tossed the instrument into the crowd. He finished the song a cappella. Tyler took artistic license to the extreme, and altered the last line of the song from \"...the home of the brave\" to \"...the home of the Indianapolis 500.\" The crowd, television and radio commentators, along with military Medal of Honor recipients in attendance due to the Memorial Day holiday, had a largely negative response to the performance. Tyler apologized and stated he meant no disrespect. Said Tyler, \"I'm very proud to be an American, and live in the home of the brave.\"\nSpeedway president Tony George released a statement the following Tuesday citing \"While we are certainly sorry that some were offended, it was neither our intention nor that of Mr. Tyler to be disrespectful. All of us have the utmost respect for the sacrifice our veterans have made for us.\"\nThe harmonica Tyler threw into the crowd was reported to be retrieved by Purdue band member David Hornthal. On the February 20, 2012 episode of \"Pawn Stars\", a harmonica purported to be the one Tyler threw into the crowd was presented, but did not sell.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indy Racing Radio Network. Mike King served as chief announcer. Johnny Rutherford served as \"driver expert\" along with newcomer Johnny Parsons.\nSeveral minor changes were made to the crew. Bob Lamey, Ken Double, and Larry Rice all departed. Kevin Lee joined the crew, taking the turn two position, which was now atop the Southeast Vista grandstand (it was previously on the roof of the VIP Suites). Chris Denari moved from the pits to turn four, where he remains as of today with the exception of 2014 when he was in Miami calling an Indiana Pacers playoff game. Howdy Bell took the limited assignment of hospital reporter and interviews during the pre-race coverage. The job of on-air \"statistician\" was eliminated permanently. Newcomers Adam Alexander and Kim Morris served as pit reporters along with Mike Lewis, who had debuted just one year earlier.\nStarting in 2001, the flagship station for the network was changed back to its original home, 1070 WIBC-AM (now WFNI). Booth interviews were kept to a minimum in 2001. King interviewed Dr. Robert Hubbard, the 2001 co-recipient of the Louis Schwitzer Award for development of the HANS device.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Al Michaels returned as host, with Bob Jenkins as announcer. Analyst Arie Luyendyk left television and returned to the cockpit. Tom Sneva left television as well. The new booth crew for 2001 included analysts Larry Rice and Jason Priestley.\nGary Gerould was not part of the 2001 broadcast. Instead he was taking part in the CART telecasts for the season. Vince Welch took his place as pit reporter, Welch's first time on television at Indy."

        "text": "The 84th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 28, 2000. The race was sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, and was part of the 2000 Indy Racing Northern Lights Series season. After four years of an ongoing organizational dispute and \"split\" in Indy car racing, Chip Ganassi Racing became the first major CART-based team to compete at the race since 1995. The Ganassi team of Jimmy Vasser and Juan Pablo Montoya competed as a one-off entry, and were well received by fans and fellow competitors. Both drivers were quickly up to speed with the IRL regulars, and were expected to be favorites in both qualifying and on race day. Also making a heralded return to Indianapolis was two-time winner Al Unser Jr. who had switched full-time to the IRL in 2000.\nDuring qualifying, defending IRL champion Greg Ray took the pole position. However, on race day, reigning CART champion Juan Pablo Montoya dominated the race. Montoya led 167 laps, and cruised to victory, becoming the first rookie winner since Graham Hill in 1966. It was the first of two Indy victories for Montoya (2000, 2015). Buddy Lazier, the 1996 winner, and eventual season champion, finished second, his second runner-up finish at Indy, and fifth consecutive top ten.\nThe 2000 race was the first to feature two female starters in the field, Lyn St. James and Sarah Fisher. The start of the race was delayed over three hours due to rain. The green flag dropped at 2:10 p.m. EST, and the race was completed shortly after 5 p.m. Seven minutes after the checkered flag, the rain returned, and doused the victory lane celebration.\nThe first 65 laps of the race were run caution-free, a new Indy 500 record at the time. Montoya became only the fourth winner to complete the race in under three hours, and at 167.607 mph, it was the fastest Indy 500 since 1991. At the end of the season, Montoya promptly departed Indy car racing for Formula One, then went to NASCAR. He would not return for his second Indy start until 2014.\nRule changes.\nDuring a yellow flag caution period, when the field is one lap away from going back to green flag conditions, the pace car would now drop off the track in turn one, and the race leader would pace the field back to the green flag and the ensuing restart. This was an effort to prevent any chance of the leader(s) accidentally passing the pace car on a restart (which happened to Scott Goodyear in the 1995 race).\nA year later, this would be combined with the \"wave around\" rule.\nTime trials.\nTime trials were scheduled for two days in 2000, May 20–21. During practice, IRL regulars generally topped the speed charts, with different names leading nearly each day. Jimmy Vasser and Juan Pablo Montoya were quickly up to speed in the IRL machines, and each managed to lead one day of practice. Both were considered contenders for the front row. Greg Ray (223.948 mph) set the fastest lap of the week on \"Fast Friday\".\nPole day - Saturday May 20.\nPole qualifying began at 11 a.m. The weather was cool and cloudy. Al Unser Jr. (220.293 mph) was the first car in the field. At 12:07 p.m., Eliseo Salazar took over the top spot with a run of 223.231 mph. Salazar remained on top for over an hour, as most cars waved off, awaiting better conditions.\nAt 1:19 p.m., Juan Pablo Montoya took to the track. His run of 223.372 mph took over the provisional pole position. Greg Ray pulled his car out of line due to handling issues, and Team Menard announced they would go out later. Jimmy Vasser went out next, and at 221.976 mph, he was not able to join his Ganassi teammate on the front row.\nLater in the day, conditions improved slightly, and several cars returned to the track. At 3:49 p.m., Greg Ray completed his run at 223.471 mph, and secured the pole position. The front row of Ray, Montoya, and Salazar was separated by only 0.173 second, the closest such margin in Indy history. The front row shaped up such that the reigning champions of IRL (Ray) and CART (Montoya) would line up 1st-2nd.\nA total of 23 cars qualified for the field. Lyn St. James wrecked on her first attempt, flipping the car up on its side in the south chute. Also into the wall were Jimmy Kite, Scott Harrington, rookie Memo Gidley and veteran Hideshi Matsuda. None of the drivers were injured.\nSarah Fisher (220.237 mph) qualified 19th, becoming the third female driver in Indy history.\nBump day - Sunday May 21.\nThe second and final day of time trials opened with ten spots remaining. Raul Boesel was the first car out, and at 222.113 mph, he would be the fastest driver of the afternoon. After two wave-offs on Saturday, Billy Boat wrecked on his first attempt on Sunday. He would be forced to find a backup car.\nThe field was filled to 33 cars by 5:30 p.m.. Among the drivers who completed attempts were Jimmy Kite, Davey Hamilton, and popular hometown rookie Andy Hillenburg. Independent driver and co-owner Hillenburg was fielding a \"throwback\" entry named the Sumar Special, a gesture to the car driven by Pat O'Connor which won the pole position in 1957.\nBilly Boat secured a backup car with the Foyt team, but the car (#41, previously driven by Roberto Guerrero) only had one attempt left. After stalling three times trying to pull away, Boat's first two laps were fair. The car stalled on the third lap, and his speed dropped to 150 mph. It picked up for the final lap, and he ran it at 198 mph. His four lap average was 192.105 mph, by far the slowest car in the field, and he was the first car on the bubble.\nLyn St. James and Dick Simon Racing reorganized after Saturday's crash, and she qualified comfortably. She bumped Boat with 25 minutes left in the day. With less than a minute until the 6 o'clock gun, Billy Boat climbed into another Foyt backup, (#11) a car that had not been driven all week. Boat managed a run of 218.872 mph out of the unproven machine. He shockingly bumped his way into the field as time expired.\nDavy Jones attempted a comeback after breaking his neck in 1997, but he was bumped.\nRace recap.\nPre-race and rain delay.\nOn Saturday May 27, the day before the Indy 500, Juan Pablo Montoya and Jimmy Vasser participated in the CART Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth Speedway. The race had been scheduled for April 11, but snow postponed it until the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. Montoya finished 4th, and Vasser 7th.\nJason Leffler, who qualified 17th at Indy, traveled to Charlotte on Saturday to participate in the NASCAR Busch Series Carquest Auto Parts 300. Leffler finished 21st at Charlotte. Also in Charlotte for part of the week was Robby Gordon, who was preparing to attempt the Indy 500/Coca-Cola 600 \"Double Duty\". Gordon required a provisional starting position for Charlotte, and he would line up 42nd. P. J. Jones was scheduled to stand by for Gordon at Charlotte if he could not make it in time for the start.\nOn race day, Sunday May 28, the morning dawned warm and sunny, but rain was in the forecast. At 10:07 a.m., rain started to fall, and the start of the race was delayed. After three brief periods of showers, at approximately 12:40 p.m., the rain stopped and held off just long enough to complete the race. Track-drying efforts began, and at 2:01 p.m. EST, Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines, and the field pulled away.\nFirst half.\nAt the start, polesitter Greg Ray took the lead. Juan Pablo Montoya settled into second, and Robby Gordon third. A fast pace over the first 20 laps saw Ray dominate, with Montoya aggressively dicing through traffic, holding a close second place.\nOn lap 27, the leaders went four-wide through traffic, and Montoya took the lead for the first time. There would only be 6 laps that he would not be in front for the rest of the race. A few laps later, all the leaders were into the pits for the first round of green flag pit stops. On lap 33 Montoya emerged with the lead, and began to flex some strength. His lead grew from 11.9 seconds on lap 34 to over 21 seconds on lap 55.\nA blistering pace over the first 60 laps saw thus far zero yellow flags. The average speed at lap 60 (150 miles) was an all-time record 207.101 mph. Montoya held a 30-second lead over second place Jimmy Vasser. On lap 66, however, Greg Ray became caught up in a wind gust, and his car pushed into the outside wall exiting turn two. This resulted in the first caution of the day, setting a new modern era Indy record (66 laps) before the first yellow. Al Unser Jr. hit a piece of debris from Ray's crash and punctured his car's radiator, causing him to drop out 22 laps later.\nMontoya now led Robby Gordon and Buddy Lazier. After the restart, however, Lyn St. James crashed into the outside wall in turn 1. Sarah Fisher was collected in the incident, and also crashed.\nAt the halfway point, Montoya still led. Vasser was second, about 5 seconds behind.\nSecond half.\nIn the second half Juan Pablo Montoya continued to dominate. His teammate Jimmy Vasser, however, started to drop down the top ten. Buddy Lazier and Jeff Ward were now in the top three, all chasing Montoya.\nOn lap 143, Greg Ray returned to the track after lengthy repairs. His return did not last long, as he smacked the outside wall in turn two - close to the same place he crashed earlier - and he was finally out of the race. Ray became the fourth polesitter (Woodbury, Carter, and Guerrero) to finish last.\nThe green came back out on lap 150, with Montoya first and Lazier close behind in second. Rookie Sam Hornish Jr. crashed on lap 158, but most of the leaders did not pit. On the restart on lap 162, Lazier made a run for the lead in turn one, but Montoya held him off.\nFinish.\nStan Wattles brought out the final yellow flag on lap 174 for a blown engine. Montoya and Lazier pitted, which allowed Jimmy Vasser to take over the lead. The green came out with 23 laps to go.\nVasser's lead did not last long, as Montoya got by him on lap 180. Lazier caught up to Vasser and passed him for second. Lazier set the fastest lap of the race (218.494 mph) on lap 198, but Montoya was too far ahead. Montoya pulled away and won the Indianapolis 500 in his first start by 7.1839 seconds over 1996 winner Buddy Lazier.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nLegacy.\nAfter the 2000 CART season, Juan Pablo Montoya signed with the Williams Formula One team, and thus did not return to defend his Indianapolis 500 championship in 2001. Later, Montoya switched to the NASCAR Cup Series, and did not race again in the Indianapolis 500 until 2014. He has also raced in the U.S. Grand Prix, Brickyard 400, and Brickyard Grand Prix, all held at IMS. He won the 99th edition of the Indianapolis 500 in 2015.\nThe 2000 Indy 500 marked a turning point in the ongoing, five-year \"split\" between IRL and CART. While neither side was prepared to make concessions towards a unification or buyout, it became evident that sponsors in the CART series desired to have their teams participate in the Indianapolis 500 to benefit from the increased exposure. Ganassi's arrival, and subsequent domination of the event led other CART-based teams to follow suit. Penske Racing considered an entry for 2000, but decided against it due to lack of preparation time. Furthermore, at the time, they only owned Riley &amp; Scott chassis, which were deemed uncompetitive. Instead, Roger Penske and Tim Cindric lent support to Jason Leffler's car at Treadway Racing. The following year additional teams (namely Penske and Team Green) returned to Indianapolis with competitive efforts. By 2004, nearly all of the major teams from CART/Champ Car had either entered singly at Indy, or defected completely to the Indy Racing League. Despite these moves, a formal unification would not take place until 2008.\nCART-based Walker Racing also \"crossed picket lines\" to enter the 2000 race, but received little publicity for doing so. Noticeably neither of the team's full-time CART drivers (Bryan Herta and Shinji Nakano), were part of the effort. The attention for Walker was instead focused on their new driver, rookie Sarah Fisher, who would become a popular fixture in the IRL in the years to come.\nStatistics.\nJuan Pablo Montoya won the race from the 2nd starting position. It was the first time a driver had won from the middle of the front row since Mario Andretti in 1969. From 1911 to 1969, the second starting position statistically produced the most race winners (ten total), more so than even the pole position (which had produced only seven winners at that time), a reflection of the Andretti curse. Montoya broke a thirty-year streak of losses by the second starting position, including many years where the no. 2 starter failed to even finish the race. As of 2022 the second starting position has not produced any additional race winners, a win–loss record of 1–52.\nSecond place finisher Buddy Lazier (the 1996 winner) was the only car towards the end of the race that was in striking distance of Montoya, but a combination of slower pit stops and difficulties in traffic, thwarted any chance of victory. It was Lazier's second runner-up finish in three years, and fifth straight finish in the top 7. Lazier, however, would go on to win the 2000 IRL championship.\nGreg Ray (67 laps) fell just seven laps short of breaking Bill Homeier's record of 74 laps for the last place finisher.\nWith Goodyear announcing in October 1999 that it was leaving the sport of open wheel racing indefinitely, the Speedway lost one of its fixtures in 2000. The Goodyear Blimp had flown over the Indy 500 in most years from 1925 to 1999, but was absent in 2000, in what was believed to be the first time in decades.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indy Racing Radio Network. Mike King served as chief announcer. The broadcast was moved into a brand new studio on the 9th floor of the newly completed Pagoda control tower. The race was heard on 549 affiliates. Due to the rain delay, the broadcast came on-air for one hour, then signed off to wait out the delay. Hourly updates were aired, then the broadcast came back to cover the pre-race ceremonies and race in its entirety.\nSeveral minor changes were made to the crew. Ken Double worked his final 500 on the network. Mark Jaynes moved from the pits to take over the turn three location vacated by one-year member Kevin O'Neal. Larry Rice and Mike Lewis joined the crew as pit reporters. This would be Rice's only year on the network. Vince Welch, formerly a pit reporter, left the crew and eventually would join ABC television. This was the last year of the Statistician position. Starting on 2001 there were no more full field rundowns every 25 laps.\nBob Lamey who joined the crew in 1988, and had become a fixture in turn 4, would be on the crew for the final time in 2000. Guests interviewed in the broadcast booth included Secretary of Defense William Cohen, John F. Fielder (BorgWarner), David Seuss (Northern Light), Kevin Forbes (IMS), Mark Miller (Nokia), and Ira Kisver (Pennzoil).\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Al Michaels returned as host, with Bob Jenkins as announcer. Arie Luyendyk, who had announced his first retirement, joined the broadcast as analyst, alongside Tom Sneva.\nAfter a one-year absence, Jack Arute returned as a pit reporter, and Leslie Gudel was added as a fourth pit reporter. Back in the ABC studios, Robin Roberts had a small role as \"Wide World of Sports\" studio host."

        "title": "1999 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 83rd Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday, May 30, 1999. The race was sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, and was part of the 1999 Pep Boys Indy Racing League season. Defending IRL champion Kenny Bräck started 8th and became the first Swedish driver to win the Indy 500.\nIndy car veteran Robby Gordon, driving for Team Menard, pitted during a caution on lap 164, looking to stretch his fuel over the final 36 laps. Gordon shuffled to front on lap 174, and pulled out to a comfortable lead. In the waning laps however, Gordon's lead began to dwindle, as he was forced to save fuel. With two laps to go, he led second place Kenny Bräck by just under two seconds. Coming out of turn four to receive the white flag (the signal for one lap to go), Gordon's car sputtered and he ran out fuel. Kenny Bräck took the lead with just over one lap to go and won for car owner A. J. Foyt. The race victory represented the long-awaited \"fifth\" Indy 500 win for A. J. Foyt, who had previously won a record four times as a driver (1961, 1964, 1967, 1977). It was also one of the most-successful races for A. J. Foyt Enterprises, with Bräck the winner, and team cars Billy Boat third, and Robbie Buhl sixth.\nPopular veteran and two-time Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk announced his plans to retire at the end of the event. He won the pole position and was a factor most of the first half. After leading 63 laps, however, he crashed while leading after he tangled with a backmarker. Luyendyk would later retract his retirement plans, and made a brief return to Indy from 2001–2003.\nAs of 2023, this stands as the 29th and final Indy victory for Goodyear tires and stands as the oldest Indianapolis 500 with all 33 starters still living.\nBackground.\nContinuing split from CART.\nThe ongoing IRL/CART split continued into its fourth year. For the third year in a row, no major teams from the CART series entered at Indianapolis. The CART series raced on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend at the Motorola 300 at Gateway near St. Louis. However, the 1999 race would end up being the final year that the CART teams stayed away. In 2000, Ganassi would return, and in subsequent years other would as well.\nTwo regular CART drivers attempted to race at both Gateway and Indy in the same weekend. Robby Gordon, who was running his own team full-time in CART, entered in both the Saturday CART event at Gateway and at Sunday's Indianapolis 500. Gordon's association to full-time IRL team John Menard was a critical piece in having a competitive Indy 500 attempt. Also attempting the open wheel \"double duty\" was veteran Roberto Moreno. Moreno had been racing regularly in CART since 1996, and had competed at Indy previously in 1986. After missing the IRL opener at Walt Disney World, Moreno ran IRL races in 1999 at Phoenix, Charlotte (canceled), and the Indy 500 with Truscelli Racing. At the same time, Moreno was picked up in early May by PacWest Racing in CART to fill in for the injured Mark Blundell and raced for them for eight rounds. As such, Moreno became slated for an unexpected double duty weekend. Then Moreno was hired for the next six CART races at Newman-Haas racing to fill in for the injured Christian Fittipaldi. Neither driver raced again in the IRL during the 1999 season.\nDouble Duty.\nFor the third time, a driver attempted the Indy/Charlotte \"Double Duty\". Tony Stewart, who switched full-time to NASCAR for 1999, also entered a car at Indy. With backing from his regular sponsor The Home Depot and support from his car owner Joe Gibbs, Stewart was attempting to become the first driver to complete the entire 1,100 in one day. Previous attempts by John Andretti (1994) and Robby Gordon (1997) did not see either driver complete the full distance. He succeeded in completing both races, finishing ninth in this race and fourth at Charlotte.\nTeam and driver changes.\nTeam Menard saw the biggest offseason changes, with 1997 season champion Tony Stewart departing for NASCAR. Greg Ray was hired to fill the vacancy. Robbie Buhl also left Menard and joined Foyt Racing for Indy.\nAt Treadway Racing, Arie Luyendyk returned for what was planned to be his final race.\nPractice.\nRookie Orientation &amp; Open Testing.\nFor the second year in a row, practice and qualifying during the month of May was trimmed down to a compressed \"two week\" schedule. In addition, for the second time, an open test was conducted in early April, which also included the annual rookie orientation program.\nRookie orientation was scheduled for April 8–9, while open testing was scheduled for April 10–13. Ten drivers took laps during rookie orientation, with nine passing all four phases. Jeret Schroeder (216.596 mph) turned the fastest lap of the session on Saturday April 10. All track activity on Friday April 9 was rained out.\nDuring the veteran's open test, Greg Ray turned the fastest lap of the week at 227.072 mph. Tyce Carlson was second at 225.683 mph.\nOpening Day – Saturday May 15.\nOpening day for the month of May was held Saturday May 15 under sunny skies and temperatures in the high 70s. Stéphan Grégoire, in a car owned by Dick Simon was the first car out of the garage, and the first car on the track, continuing a tradition held by Simon-owned entries.\nGreg Ray (225.887 mph) ran the fastest lap of the day. No serious incidents were reported, but Ray, Mike Groff, Robby Unser, Donnie Beechler, and Scott Harrington all brought out yellow flags for blown engines or mechanical failures.\nSunday May 16.\nAbout a half-hour into the session, Billy Boat spun and crashed in turn 1. He was uninjured, and returned to the track in a back-up car later in the afternoon.\nAfter racing at Richmond the previous night, Tony Stewart arrived at the Speedway and took his first laps of the month on Sunday. He was 7th-best lap of the day at 222.091 mph.\nGreg Ray once again led the speed chart at 225.124 mph.\nMonday May 17.\nThe day started with Robby Gordon on the track for the first time during the month. A few minutes later, Mike Borkowski crashed heavily in turn 2 at 11:57 a.m. He climbed from the car uninjured.\nScott Harrington crashed in turn three, and Billy Boat had his second crash in two days. Both drivers were cleared to drive.\nAt 3:46 p.m., rain began to fall, closing the track early for the day. Greg Ray once more led the speed chart (224.843 mph).\nTuesday May 18.\nOvernight rain and moisture kept the track closed until 2:00 p.m. Another shower closed it again until almost 4 o'clock. A brief practice session still saw 37 drivers take to the track, and over 1,400 laps completed. Scott Goodyear (223.842 mph) finally bumped Greg Ray off the top of the speed chart.\nWednesday May 19.\nRookie Dave Steele crashed hard into the outside wall in turn 1 at 11:33 a.m., suffering a concussion, and was forced to sit out the remainder of the month. About an hour later, Greg Ray blew an engine, and Tyce Carlson who was behind him, slid in the oil laid down by Ray's engine. Carlson spun and tapped the outside wall in the south chute, but the car only suffered minor damage.\nThe third crash of the day involved Mark Dismore. He hit the wall twice between turns 1 and 2, but was not injured.\nWith just 30 minutes left in the day, Tony Stewart completed a lap of 226.683 mph, the fastest lap thus far for the month.\nThursday May 20.\nCrashes were suffered by Johnny Unser and Tony Stewart. Both drivers were uninjured. Greg Ray was back on top of the speed chart at 227.192 mph, fastest of the month.\n\"Fast\" Friday May 21.\nThe final full day of practice saw Greg Ray (227.175 mph) once again top the speed chart. However, Arie Luyendyk (226.131 mph) was close behind in second.\nJohn Paul Jr. was injured in a crash around 1:30 p.m., and he was sidelined for the month with a severe back contusion. Also crashing was Mike Borkowski, his second wreck of the week.\nTime trials.\nPole Day – Saturday May 22.\nTime trials opened at 12:00 p.m., with overcast skies and temperatures in the mid-60s. The early attention focused on Tony Stewart, and his busy qualifying schedule. Stewart's attempt at \"Double Duty\" meant that he was due in Charlotte later that afternoon for The Winston all-star race, and had a tight window in which to qualify at Indy. Stewart was the second car in line to make a qualifying attempt, but settled for a disappointing 220.653 mph run. Minutes later, Stewart was escorted to the airport and departed for Concord, North Carolina. The slow qualifying speed put Stewart in a somewhat precarious situation that left him vulnerable to possibly being bumped before day's end.\nAt 12:50 p.m., Billy Boat crashed for the third time of the month. On his warmup lap, he spun on cold tires in turn 2, and hit the wall on the backstretch. Minutes later, Robbie Buhl crashed on his warmup lap as well.\nAt 1:17 p.m., Kenny Brack (222.650 mph) took over the provisional pole position with eight cars in the field. At 1:30 p.m., Arie Luyendyk took to the track, attempting to qualify for what was to be his final Indy 500. His four-lap average of 225.179 mph secured him the pole position, and was a track record for normally-aspirated engines.\nThe next two hours saw heavy activity, and by 3:30 p.m., the field was filled to 25 cars. The last car with a likely shot at the pole was Greg Ray. After a lap of 225.643 mph (which tied Luyendyk's fastest single lap), Ray ended up second with a four-lap average of 225.073 mph, just 0.075 seconds behind Luyendyk's time.\nAfter a brief down period, activity picked up in the final hour. After crashing earlier in the day, Billy Boat put his car on the outside of the front row. His four-lap average of 223.469 mph was third-fastest. One car, later, Robby Gordon qualified 4th at 223.066 mph.\nAs time trials closed for the day at 6 o'clock, Scott Harrington completed his run, filling the field to a full 33 cars. It was the first time since 1983 that the field had been completely filled in one afternoon, and was accomplished despite a one-hour rain delay. Tony Stewart's early run held on to put him in 24th starting position.\nLuyendyk's pole position was the third of his career (1993, 1997), and his fifth front row start.\nLater that night, Tony Stewart won the Winston Open and finished second in The Winston.\nBump Day - Sunday May 23.\nThe second and final day of qualifying opened with rain in the forecast and about six drivers looking to bump their way into the field. During morning practice, Lyn St. James blew an engine and crashed in turn 4. She had entered the day on the bubble, and if she were to be bumped, she would be done for the month. With only six drivers ready, and rain on its way, Tony Stewart's slow speed from Saturday was now considered safe. \nTime trials began at 12 noon, with Raul Boesel easily bumping his way into the field. St. James was bumped, missing the race for the second year in a row. Boesel was followed by Johnny Unser who went even faster. Robbie Buhl, however, was having trouble all weekend. After crashing on Saturday, he blew his engine on his warm up lap, and the team feverishly started installing a new motor.\nAndy Michner spun on his first qualifying attempt, but did not make any contact. He waved off his second attempt after being too slow. Rain clouds were entering the area, and threatened to wash out the rest of the day. At 1:48 p.m., Mike Groff (220.066 mph) bumped his way into the field. However, he himself was now on the bubble.\nAt 1:58 p.m., Foyt Racing had hastily prepared a car for Robbie Buhl and put it in the qualifying line. The car had spare pieces from other machines, and the car number was taped on with black electrical tape. Buhl's run of 220.115 mph barely bumped out Groff, despite sprinkles falling during the last two laps. Seconds after the checkered flag, heavy rain began to fall, all but securing Buhl's spot in the race.\nThe track closed for the day due to rain with Stéphan Grégoire waiting in line. It was the first time an entry associated with Dick Simon failed to qualify since 1982.\nCarb Day - Thursday May 27.\nThe final practice session saw Sam Schmidt (222.458 mph) on top of the speed chart. Scott Goodyear blew an engine, and Jimmy Kite stalled with clutch problems, but no serious incidents were reported.\nRobby Gordon skipped the session and was at Gateway for the CART Motorola 300. Greg Ray shook down his car for a few laps. Roberto Moreno, who was also participating at Gateway, did practice for about an hour, then departed for St. Louis. Both drivers came back Sunday for race day.\nTony Stewart returned to the track after his busy weekend. He took part in pole qualifying for the Coca-Cola 600 on Wednesday night, but did not make the top 20 there. He planned on 'standing on his time' at Charlotte and remaining in Indianapolis for the rest of the day. Since Stewart was expected to miss the mandatory NASCAR pre-race drivers meeting, he was poised to start last on the grid at Charlotte regardless of his qualifying speed.\nLater in the afternoon, Galles Racing won the Coors Indy Pit Stop Challenge with driver Davey Hamilton.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nMedal of Honor winners were honored during the pre-race ceremonies, coinciding with the unveiling of the new Medal of Honor Memorial in downtown Indianapolis. The national anthem was performed by gospel singer CeCe Winans. \nPolesitter, and race favorite Arie Luyendyk jumped out to the early lead, holding the top spot for the first 32 laps. The first caution flag flew on lap 9 when Eliseo Salazar got loose coming off turn 2 and slammed into the inside wall.\nPit incident.\nDuring the first caution, several cars pitted. At the north end of the pits, Jimmy Kite's car clipped the left rear wheel of Jeret Schroeder, sending Kite into the pit box of Robby McGehee. The collision knocked out a few members of McGehee's crew, including crew chief Steve Fried, of Mentor, Ohio, who was working on the right front tire. Fried was initially listed in critical condition at Methodist Hospital with a head injury. Later in the race, he was reported as awake and alert, but he would require a lengthy recuperation. Kite's car suffered extensive internal damage and spent most of the race in the garage for repairs, before retiring late due to engine trouble. In subsequent years, it was made mandatory for pit crew members to hear helmets and other protective gear.\nFirst half.\nArie Luyendyk and Greg Ray took turns at the from for nearly all of the first 60 laps. Luyendyk relinquished his lead after making a pit stop on lap 33, and Ray led the next lap before he came in for service. Sam Schmidt inherited the lead until the cars of Roberto Guerrero and Hideshi Matsuda stalled on the track, bringing out a yellow flag. Schmidt and several others pitted under the caution, allowing Luyendyk to retake the lead. Kenny Bräck, the reigning IRL champion, driving for four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt, took the lead for the first time on lap 60 after passing Ray in turn two. \nSam Schmidt brought out the yellow when he backed into the wall in turn one on lap 63. Luyendyk regained the lead following pit stops, but was passed by Bräck shortly after the restart. On lap 84, Ray returned to the lead by passing Brack. Steve Knapp backed into the turn 1 wall to bring out the fourth caution on lap 94. Shortly after the restart on lap 100, Scott Goodyear, another of the prerace favorites, brought out another yellow, stopping in turn two with engine problems.\nSecond half.\nArie Luyendyk was leading on lap 118 when he approached the lapped car of Tyce Carlson going into in turn three. Luyendyk tried to overtake Carlson on the inside of the corner, but grazed the left rear wheel, slid backwards and into the turn three wall. It was race's sixth caution period. With Luyendyk out of the race, Greg Ray took over the lead. As Ray completed his pit stop, he moved toward the far lane, unaware that Mark Dismore, who was entering for his service, was already occupying that lane. Both cars collided and slid into the vacant pit box of Scott Sharp, which was adjacent to Dismore's pit. Dismore continued on, but Ray suffered serious front suspension damage and dropped out of the race. \nDefending Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever led the field for the restart on lap 124, but was passed by Kenny Bräck and Jeff Ward at the drop of the green. Brack stretched his advantage to as much as 5 seconds. Meanwhile, Tony Stewart had fallen back considerably due to handling problems and made an unscheduled pit stop. Cheever's day suddenly ended on lap 140 due to an engine problem. Bräck made a green-flag stop on lap 150, and Ward grabbed the lead for 2 laps until he pitted, putting Bräck out in front again.\nWith less than 40 laps left, Bräck and Ward continued to run 1st-2nd. Bräck's teammate at A. J. Foyt Racing, Billy Boat moved up to 3rd place; Mark Dismore was hanging in 4th place despite the pit road mishap on the last yellow flag; and rookie Robby McGehee, despite concerns about the health of his crew chief after the early pit road incident, was in 5th place. Also in contention was Team Menard driver Robby Gordon. With teammate Greg Ray already out of the race after the mishap with Dismore, Gordon was left to carry the banner for owner John Menard, who was making his 20th appearance at Indy.\nOn Lap 162, the caution came out again for Jimmy Kite's stalled car. During the caution, some of the leaders made routine pit stops, Robby Gordon among them. Gordon was running sixth out of the seven cars remaining on the lead lap. He came into the pits on lap 164, one lap before the green came back out. The Menard team was gambling by topping off the fuel tank in the hopes he would have enough fuel to last the final 36 laps. The green came out on lap 165, but on lap 169, Mark Dismore brushed the wall off turn two. The right-front wheel separated and bounced across the track on the backstretch, bringing out the final caution of the race. Most of the leaders pitted under this caution, which would be their final scheduled stops. Gordon stayed out on the track, and shuffled to the lead for the restart which came on lap 174.\nFinish.\nAs the laps wound down, with twenty laps to go, Gordon had built a comfortable lead. His crew insisted that he was ok on fuel. Behind him, with 12 laps remaining, Kenny Bräck made a move around Jeff Ward for second place. Bräck began charging and narrowed the deficit as Gordon struggled to keep fuel in the car. On lap 195, he was 3.5 seconds behind. By lap 198, the lead was down to less than 2 seconds.\nWith two laps to go, the lapped car of Robbie Buhl was all that separated Gordon and Bräck. Bräck was 1.5 seconds behind Gordon as they approached turn three. Heading into turn four, Gordon's machine began sputtering and he veered onto pit road, out of fuel. Bräck assumed the lead at the head of the mainstretch and took the white flag to start the final lap. The next time by, the checkered flag waved with Bräck the winner. Gordon settled for 4th place.\nBräck's victory marked the fifth overall Indianapolis 500 victory for A. J. Foyt - four as a driver or owner/driver (1961, 1964, 1967, 1977) and one as an owner (1999). Bräck, who led the most laps in the race (66), took the lead for good at the end of lap 199. At the time, it equaled the official record for the latest lead change. However, unofficially, it was in fact the latest lead change in Indy history (until 2006), with Bräck assuming the lead approximately 2.8 miles to the checkered flag.\nPost-race notes.\nIn the engine battle between the Oldsmobile Aurora and the Nissan Infiniti, Aurora dominated the race, leading 196 of 200 laps. The top 15 starters used Auroras. Eddie Cheever performed the best of the Infiniti powerplants, leading the 4 laps not led by Aurora. Jeret Schroeder was the top finisher among Infiniti-powered cars, finishing 15th after dropping out late in the race.\nChilean driver Eliseo Salazar, who crashed out of the race in the opening laps, was awarded with the Scott Brayton trophy, awarded to the driver best exemplifying the character and racing spirit of the late driver Scott Brayton. Robbie Buhl, who struggled during practice and barely made the field on Bump Day, charged from 32nd starting position to finish 6th. He joined winner Bräck, and third place Billy Boat for three Foyt cars in the top six.\nScott Sharp, who qualified on the outside of the second row, suffered a humiliating gaffe when his pit crew neglected to remove the protective air blocks from the radiator inlets. The car pulled away from the grid with the air blocks still inserted, precipitating a swift and uncontrollable overheating condition. Though the crew was able to get the car back out on the track, the damage was done, and the car dropped out short of the halfway point with transmission and engine failure. The incident prompted some teams across the grid to pay more attention to pre-race checklists and affix fluorescent \"warning strips\" or brightly-colored flags to the air blocks and other similar devices to avoid similar failures in the future.\nLinda Conti, the team manager for 5th place Robby McGehee, is believed to have been the first female team manager in Indy 500 history.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\n\"Sports Illustrated\" controversy.\nOn May 1, 1999, at the VisionAire 500K at Lowe's Motor Speedway three spectators were killed, and eight others (two of whom were children) were injured when a piece of debris went into the grandstands. On the 61st lap, Stan Wattles crashed in turn four, shearing off both right-side wheels. The car of John Paul Jr. struck one of the wheels, propelling it into the stands. A witness claimed a wheel with suspension pieces flew into the seats. The incident occurred two weeks before the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was scheduled to open for practice.\nIn the May 10, 1999, edition of \"Sports Illustrated\", Ed Hinton penned an article reporting the tragedy, and discussed the general topic of safety in motorsports. The magazine's editors in New York published the article accompanied by an AP photograph taken at the scene. The photo featured a security guard standing next to two dead bodies in the grandstands covered with bloody sheets, and blood covering the steps.\nIn the week following the magazine's release, IMS/IRL president Tony George issued a letter stating his extreme displeasure with the article and the photo, describing that it was insensitive and inappropriate, and declared that Hinton was to be denied credentials to the 1999 Indianapolis 500 and future events at the track. Immediately after word of the ban spread, press and media response was very negative. The \"Chicago Tribune\", \"The Detroit News\", \"Los Angeles Times\", and several other newspapers announced they were all boycotting the event, citing censorship. In addition, they came to the defense of Hinton, because he wrote only the text in the article, and did not know about the photograph until after the edition was published.\nA few days later, the controversy reached a boiling point, and George backed down and retracted the ban. He issued Hinton his credentials, and most of the reporters (some reluctantly) returned to cover the race. However, the Hinton/censorship incident stayed in the news for a long time, and caused friction between the media and the still-fledgling league.\nDue to the tragedy at Charlotte, the league adopted wheel tethers in time for the 1999 Indy 500 to prevent tires from flying off cars during crashes and potentially injuring spectators and drivers.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indy Racing Radio Network. Mike King was named the new chief announcer, and became the fifth person to serve as \"Voice of the 500\". Previous chief announcer Bob Jenkins left the radio to take over the announcing role on ABC-TV. The broadcast was heard on 556 affiliates.\nThe broadcasting booth for the 1999 race was located in a makeshift manner, temporarily installed in the then under-construction Pagoda. Booth announcers King, Rutherford, and others were situated in an elevator shaft, with no access to the ground or restrooms while the race was underway.\nGary Lee departed, and was replaced in turn three by Kevin O'Neal, a reporter from \"The Indianapolis Star\" and announcer from the Indianapolis Speedrome. It was O'Neal's only appearance on the network. Chris Denari also made his network debut.\nWith King as the new chief announcer, a trend returned to the broadcasts starting in 1999, not seen since the days of Sid Collins. King began to interview booth guests (celebrities, politicians, and sponsor representatives)\n, whether live in-person, or pre-recorded. For 1999, the limitations of the booth precluded live interviews, but John F. Fielder of BorgWarner was featured in a pre-recorded segment.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Changes were made at ABC/ESPN for 1999, as the networks created separate crews for their IRL and CART broadcasts. Paul Page, who had broadcast the 500 with either radio or television since 1974, was removed and shifted to the CART series. Bob Jenkins, formerly the radio network announcer for the 500, moved into the ABC-TV booth.\nTom Sneva returned as analyst, and for 1999 the \"host\" position was revived, with longtime ABC personality Al Michaels joining the crew. Jack Arute had left ABC for a short time to cover IRL races on Speedvision and FSN, and thus was absent from this telecast. Jon Beekhuis was brought in to take his place in the pit area. Meanwhile, Gary Gerould conducted the winner's interview in victory lane, which was normally Arute's duty.\nWith Paul Page not part of the broadcast, this was the first Indy 500 in over a decade without the familiar \"Delta Force intro\". In addition, a new camera angle debuted, mounted at the top of the famous scoring pylon.\nPractice and time trials were carried over three networks: ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2. \nAt the track, several of the electronic dot matrix scoreboards were removed and replaced with four Daktronics ProStarä Video Plus screens and three Daktronics ProStarä large screens (one each inside the four turns, one each inside the two shortchutes, and one along the north end of the mainstretch). A year later, the project was completed, and an additional six Daktronics ProStarä video screens were installed along the inside and outside of the frontstretch."

        "text": "The 82nd Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 24, 1998. This was the third Indianapolis 500 run as part of the Indy Racing League, but the first fully-sanctioned by the IRL after they relied on USAC to sanction the 1996–1997 races. The race was part of the 1998 Pep Boys Indy Racing League season.\nEddie Cheever, a former Formula One driver that had competed in Indy car racing since 1990, highlighted his racing career with this lone Indianapolis win. Cheever finished three seconds ahead of second place Buddy Lazier, the 1996 winner. Cheever became the first owner/driver to win the \"500\" since A. J. Foyt in 1977. The 1998 race ushered in a compacted, two-week schedule for the Indy 500, omitting an entire week of practice, and trimming qualifying from four days down to two.\nDuring time trials, Billy Boat secured the first pole position at Indy for the Foyt team since 1975.\nThis was the first Indianapolis victory for the Dallara chassis. In the second year utilizing the 4.0 L, normally aspirated, 32-valve production-based engines (Aurora L47 and Infiniti VH), qualifying speeds climbed, topping out nearly six miles per hour faster than 1997.\nBackground.\nContinuing split from CART.\nThe ongoing IRL/CART split continued into its third year. The two series began moving further apart, and for the second time, no major teams from the CART ranks entered at Indianapolis. CART teams raced on Saturday at the Motorola 300.\nEntry list.\nThe first entry list was published on April 14. The 34 cars that had run in any of the first two rounds of 1998 were entered, including the #27 Blueprint Racing entry, initially unassigned after Robbie Groff failed to complete a racing lap. The car was initially scheduled to be run by Cary Faas at the Rookie Orientation Program, but the test never happened. RSM Marko also failed to undertake his scheduled Rookie Orientation Program test with driver Dave Steele, and the team would not appear afterwards, while Team Coulson Racing never appointed a driver for the #41 car. \nEarlier in the month, D. B. Mann Motorsports had named Dan Drinan in the #24 car driven by Billy Roe at Orlando. Two cars had driver changes before the start of practice due to budgetary issues: Chitwood Motorsports signed Andy Michner in the #17 car the day before ROP in place of Brian Tyler, both passing their tests with the team, and PDM Racing replaced John Paul Jr. on May 5 with rookie Jack Hewitt, who had passed all but one of his rookie test phases in Jack Miller's Sinden Racing entry on April. Finally, Blueprint announced during Opening Day that the #27 seat would go to second-year driver Claude Bourbonnais.\nBefore the start of practice, eight further car/driver combinations were registered, pushing the total to 40 competitors. Team Scandia announced the signing of Billy Roe for a second car in late March, both Robby Unser and Steve Knapp were announced for additional entries by Team Cheever and ISM Racing on April 9, and Donnie Beechler was confirmed a day later for a new team, Cahill Auto Racing. At the release of the entry list, Lyn St. James confirmed her programme as a driver/owner, while LP Racing entered a second car for Scott Harrington. In the final week leading to practice, Joe Gosek was signed by new outfit Liberty Racing, and veteran Danny Ongais received a call-up before Opening Day to drive for yet another new team, Pelfrey, which had been denied a request to field Shawn Bayliff due to a lack of experience.\nPractice.\nSunday May 10.\nOpening day saw Mike Groff take the honor of \"first car on the track.\" Crashes during the day were suffered by Jack Hewitt and Jimmy Kite, neither were serious. Robbie Buhl was the fastest car of the day, at 219.325 mph.\nMonday May 11.\nTony Stewart led the speed chart, with a lap of 223.703 mph. It was the fastest lap since the normally aspirated engine formula was adopted in 1997. Eight drivers in total broke the 200 mph barrier.\nDanny Ongais suffered the most serious crash thus far for the month, and was sidelined with a concussion. Arie Luyendyk, Mike Groff, Raul Boesel and Tony Stewart all suffered mechanical problems, and required tows back to the garage area.\nOff the track, Eddie Cheever announced a sponsorship deal with Rachel's Gourmet Potato Chips.\nTuesday May 12.\nTony Stewart nearly matched his speed from a day before, with a fast lap of 223.691 mph. Second best Kenny Bräck was a full 2 mph slower at 221.593 mph.\nSunny skies, with temperatures in the 70s greeted the Speedway for the third day in a row.\nWednesday May 13.\nMoisture from an overnight shower delayed the start of practice for about a half-hour. Billy Boat took the honors for fastest of the day at 221.691 mph, while Tony Stewart sat out the day. Temperatures topped out at 80 degrees late in the day.\nThursday May 14.\nJimmy Kite suffered his second wall contact of the week, backing the car into the wall in turn 4. Another warm, 83 degree afternoon saw Tony Stewart once again on top of the speed chart (223.430 mph).\n\"Fast\" Friday May 15.\nThe final day of practice before pole day was warm, with a high of 81 degrees. Tony Stewart topped the speed chart with the fastest lap of the month (223.797 mph). Kenny Bräck and Billy Boat were also over 221 mph.\nBoat, however, wrecked his primary car in turn 3 shortly after the 11 a.m. start. Also spinning in a separate incident (but not making contact) was Jack Hewitt.\nAt the close of practice, Tony Stewart entered time trials as the favorite for the pole position. Stewart led the speed chart on four of the six days of practice (sitting out one day). Foyt drivers Kenny Bräck and Billy Boat were also front row favorites, however, Boat's crash on Friday seemed to dim his chances.\nTime trials.\nPole Day – Saturday May 16.\nPole day dawned sunny and clear, with temperatures in the high 70s. Qualifying started on-time promptly at 11 a.m., but saw two early wave-offs. The first two notable runs were put in by Robbie Buhl (220.236 mph) and Tony Stewart (220.386 mph), but the speeds were down from their expectations.\nAt noon, Kenny Bräck took over the provisional pole with a run of 220.982 mph. Minutes later, Jimmy Kite crashed for the third time of the week. At 12:45 p.m., Billy Boat took to the track for his run. His first lap was a remarkable 224.573 mph, the fastest lap of the month. The three other laps dropped off, but his four-lap average of 223.503 mph was fast enough to secure the pole position.\nSixteen cars completed runs before the mid-afternoon down time. Around 4:15 p.m., qualifying resumed, with drivers Scott Sharp and Eddie Cheever among those making the field. At 5:15 p.m., Greg Ray squeezed onto the front row, as the second-fastest qualifier (221.125 mph).\nAt the end of the day, the field was filled to 26 cars, after a record 42 qualifying attempts. Among the notables not yet in the field were Arie Luyendyk, Lyn St. James, and Jeff Ward. Luyendyk suffered through engine trouble most of the day.\nBilly Boat's unexpected speed in qualifying drew the attention of competitors, given that it occurred in the heat of the day, and it was miles per hour faster than he had run all week. Team Menard threatened to protest, and accused Foyt Racing of cheating by illegally using nitrous. The Indy Racing League took no action, and Boat was not penalized.\nBump Day – Sunday May 17.\nWith seven positions remaining in the field, the second and final day of time trials saw heavy activity. In the first hour, veterans Raul Boesel, Arie Luyendyk and Jeff Ward were among the early qualifiers. Scott Harrington, however, blew an engine and wrecked on his second lap, which put a halt to qualifying for nearly 45 minutes.\nIn the heat of the day (1:52 p.m.), Eliseo Salazar completed a run at 216.259 mph, the second-slowest in the field. His run was followed by a long down-time, as teams waited for optimum conditions.\nAt 4:30 p.m., qualifying resumed, and several cars took to the track. During the next hour, 13 attempts were made, but only 5 were run to completion. After three wrecks for the week, Jimmy Kite found the needed speed, and managed to fill the field to 33 cars at 4:55 p.m. With Billy Roe (215.781 mph) the first driver on the bubble, Mike Groff bumped him out at 5:23 p.m. That put Eliseo Salazar (216.259 mph) on the bubble. Minutes later, Roe went back out and bumped his way back into the field. The move placed Johnny Unser (216.316 mph) now on the bubble.\nClaude Bourbonnais, Dan Drinan, and Lyn St. James all fell short of Johnny Unser's speed, and failed to bump him out. With four minutes remaining, Eliseo Salazar scrambled into Stan Wattles' back-up car, but managed only 211 mph on the first two laps. The car began smoking, and he was waved off. The 6 o'clock gun fired with Hideshi Matsuda waiting in line.\nWith Lyn St. James having failed to qualify, the 500 had an all-male field for the first time since 1991.\nCarb Day - Thursday May 21.\nThe final practice session saw the Foyt entries of Kenny Bräck and Billy Boat top the speed chart. Bräck (220.994 mph) was the only driver over 220 mph. No incidents were reported, but Stan Wattles twice stalled on the track with mechanical problems.\nPanther Racing with driver Scott Goodyear won the Coors Indy Pit Stop Challenge.\nRace recap.\nPre race.\nRain fell race morning, and delayed the start of the race by about 35 minutes. While track drying efforts were on-going, a dog sneaked out onto the track in turn four, and began running down the pit lane. It eluded officials, and ran all the way to turn two before being caught. Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines at 11:32 a.m. EST, and the field pulled away for the parade laps. Before the final pace lap, Raul Boesel entered the pits with a fuel pump problem and missed the start of the race. His car would only complete three racing laps before being towed to the garage on Lap 8, going on to lose 35 laps until he was back on track.\nStart.\nAt the start, Eddie Cheever got loose in turn one, and pinched J. J. Yeley down to the inside, which resulted in a half-spin for both of them, and an early caution for three laps. Despite a slight contact, Cheever continued unharmed. Yeley managed to stop the car without hitting the wall, but his engine stalled, and lost a lap awaiting to be restarted by safety crews.\nAt the front of the pack, Billy Boat led the first dozen laps, while Kenny Bräck dropped from third to tenth on the restart due to a missed gear. On lap 13, Greg Ray took over the lead, with Tony Stewart charging in third after exchanging passes with teammate Robbie Buhl. On Lap 16, Buddy Lazier pitted out of sequence from tenth place, looking for an alternative strategy. By Lap 19, Bräck had climbed back to third place, passing Buhl and Boat in the same lap. \nOn Lap 21, Ray became hung up in traffic, and Stewart dove into the lead down the main stretch. One lap later, however, Stewart's engine blew and the car coasted to a stop in turn one. A dejected Stewart threw his steering wheel and gloves into his empty cockpit, as misfortune struck him again for the third straight \"500\".\nFirst half.\nThe first round of pit stops under caution saw an incident between Jeff Ward and Stéphan Grégoire. After his stop, Ward collided with the left rear tyre of Grégoire as he was entering his pit box, damaging his own front wing. Billy Boat fell to the bottom of the top 10 after stalling his car, and Arie Luyendyk developed a clutch issue that prevented him from downshifting into first or second gear, which made him stall three times before finally getting onto the track. Just before the restart, Scott Goodyear relinquished his fourth place and entered the pits again, losing 35 laps with clutch issues.\nGreg Ray led the restart on Lap 27 ahead of Kenny Bräck and Davey Hamilton, while running behind the cars of Luyendyk and Lazier, which were still on the lead lap. By that point, Eddie Cheever was already up to 10th place, having passed several cars and taking advantage from not stopping during the previous caution. On Lap 32, race leader Ray slowed suddenly on the backstraight with a broken transmission. He made it to the pits and would later rejoin the race, 18 laps down. Two laps later, Donnie Beechler broke an engine, bringing out the third caution of the race, on which Lazier made his second pit stop and Boat made additional stops to correct handling issues.\nRobbie Buhl had overtaken Hamilton during a brief slowdown caused by Ray's issues, and was second behind Kenny Bräck, but he encountered water temperature problems in his engine. After the restart on Lap 39, Buhl lost places to Hamilton and Scott Sharp, and was already down in seventh place when he suffered yet another engine failure, ending Team Menard's race on Lap 45. Before that yellow, Cheever continued his charge towards the front; having passed Roberto Guerrero and rookie Steve Knapp earlier, he also got past Sam Schmidt, Buhl and Sharp to claim third place, just missing on a pass for second over Hamilton while the caution came out. Buzz Calkins and Buddy Lazier, both out of sequence, led the restart as the green came out on Lap 49, while Billy Boat's gearbox finally seized as it got stuck in second gear. \nDuring the restart lap, a major crash occurred in turn 3 when several cars were running two-wide at the front of the field. Sam Schmidt, running inside of Davey Hamilton for second place, got into the grass, lost control, and spun backwards into the turn three wall. Eddie Cheever, who was immediately behind after getting passed by Schmidt, slipped underneath, and escaped the incident. Stan Wattles ran into the back of Mark Dismore, and they collected Roberto Guerrero. \nJim Guthrie then approached the scene and tried to avoid the crash by running on the grass, but he collected an errant wing from Schmidt's car that fell in front of him just as he rejoined the racetrack, and the car shot head-on into the outside wall. Guthrie was extracted by the medical team and transported to Methodist Hospital with a broken elbow, broken leg, and cracked ribs. Billy Roe avoided the incident at first, but spun the car on the deceleration lane between turns 3 and 4, and crashed.\nAfter a long yellow flag, and a series of pit stops, Kenny Bräck and Eddie Cheever were leading the race over Scott Sharp. Arie Luyendyk had taken advantage of the high attrition and good restarts to place himself in fourth place over an advancing John Paul Jr. and Davey Hamilton, who had repaired minor damages during his pit stop. Buddy Lazier, on the other hand, had stayed out in the lead until Lap 61 and was placed in tenth at the time among the 13 cars on the lead lap. The race got back underway on Lap 64, with Cheever taking the lead for the first time on Lap 68 and Paul Jr. climbing up to second by Lap 73, while Sharp lost places steadily.\nGreen flag pit stops occurred from Lap 83, with Buddy Lazier pitting ten laps later. Arie Luyendyk had to be pushed out due to his clutch issues, and a miscalculation by Foyt's crew caused Kenny Bräck to run out of fuel, costing him two laps. The mistake angered A. J. Foyt, who scolded his engineers before smashing the team's computer. Eddie Cheever lost some time during his stop as he exited his pit box before his crew removed the fuel nozzle, but he managed to retain the lead by 1.5 seconds over John Paul Jr., with Davey Hamilton a further five seconds behind and Robby Unser holding Luyendyk for fourth. As Cheever had lapped several cars, Steve Knapp and Lazier were the last cars on the lead lap, half a minute behind. Just after the pit stops were completed, the caution came out on Lap 96, as Jimmy Kite stopped along the track.\nSecond half.\nWith just seven cars on the lead lap, Eddie Cheever and Steve Knapp took advantage of the yellow to top off on fuel, handing the lead to John Paul Jr. as the green came out at the halfway point, when Johnny Unser retired with a blown engine. Paul pulled a five second lead over Davey Hamilton before he pitted on Lap 113, with Robby Unser, Hamilton and Arie Luyendyk following suit. After completing a pit stop, Jack Miller stopped on Turn 2 with a battery issue, handing Cheever, Buddy Lazier and Knapp the opportunity to pit again. \nAfter the Lap 128 restart, Luyendyk passed Hamilton for second, and Cheever followed suit climbing up to third. After his earlier gearbox troubles, Billy Boat finally dropped out for good on Lap 132. In the subsequent caution, Jeff Ward lost a rear wheel that had been poorly fixed in a previous green flag stop. The race restarted on Lap 136, with Paul Jr., Luyendyk and Cheever running closely together. Paul Jr. picked up a big piece of plastic in his radiators and had a slow pit stop on Lap 147, and Robby Unser overshoot his pit stall. \nLuyendyk's clutch problems finally took their toll on Lap 150 as he left the pits very slowly. The caution came out three laps later, as Luyendyk pulled off between turns 3 and 4, causing Robby Unser to fall off the lead lap. Paul Jr. and Hamilton had managed to not lose a lap with Cheever and led the restart order on Lap 157. Hamilton was quickly dealt with, but Paul Jr. offered more resistance until Lap 163, when a malfunction in the yellow flag indicator of his steering wheel made him lift off just enough to lose his lap. This left Buddy Lazier and Steve Knapp as the only other drivers on the lead lap, four and seven seconds back respectively.\nA new caution period on Lap 176 set the stage for the end of the race, when Stéphan Grégoire brushed the wall heavily in Turn 4. John Paul Jr.'s slim chances for a win died when he stalled four times trying to exit the pits on lap 177. He lost three laps, and was in the pits for almost four minutes. All three drivers in the lead lap were now in the same strategy, with Cheever and Lazier separated by the lapped cars of Robby Unser and Jeff Ward, and Steve Knapp a further four lapped cars behind Lazier. The restart on Lap 180 was short lived, as Jack Hewitt spun the car on the outside of Turn 1. The veteran rookie used his dirt track skills to keep the car off the wall. In the following restart, Scott Sharp lost second gear and had to retire from fifth place.\nFinish.\nWith 17 laps to go, Buddy Lazier passed the lapped cars on the restart and went after Cheever, being able to keep up for a few laps. Cheever eventually stretched the lead to over 3 seconds, but another yellow on Lap 191 was brought out by the smoking car of Marco Greco. With five laps to go, the green came back out, and Lazier was nose-to-tail with Cheever, who held off the challenge as he weaved from side to side in the front straight. Cheever set off on a blistering pace and almost brushed the wall a lap later at the exit of Turn 3, but stretched out to a 3.19-second margin to grab the victory.\nSteve Knapp, the only other driver to finish on the lead lap, was named rookie of the year after finishing third in his first Indy car race, a feat last accomplished by Lyn St. James in 1992. Kenny Bräck salvaged a sixth place finish, and Andy Michner kept his nose clean while battling an electrical problem to finish eighth over J. J. Yeley. Both were scored three laps down, and neither would run at Indy again. Mike Groff suffered from engine misfires during the whole race in route to a 15th place finish, in what would be his final Indy car start.\nCheever became the first driver to win the Indy 500 in his own car since A. J. Foyt in 1977, and the first winner since 1989 to have led the most laps. His win from 17th on the grid was the farthest an Indy car race had been won since Al Unser's fourth Indy 500 win from 20th in 1987. For the first time, and last, since 1982, all drivers in the top 5 hailed from the United States, with Bräck as the lone foreign driver within the top 13, and four rookies finished in the top 10 for the first time since 1965. Due to the high attrition among the main favourites, none of the top 3 drivers had started in the first three rows, as it had happened in the highly infamous 1973 and 1992 races.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the Indy Racing Radio Network. The network, previously known as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network, had changed its name for 1998, to reflect its coverage of the entire Indy Racing League season. At least 541 affiliates carried the broadcast across the United States.\nBob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the ninth and final year. Overall it would be the 20th and final year for Jenkins on the radio network crew (except for a brief stint as a turn reporter in 2007–2008). In addition, Jerry Baker celebrated his milestone 25th year on the broadcast.\nJohnny Rutherford served as \"driver expert\". WTHR sports director and Speedway public address announcer Dave Calabro joined the crew as a pit reporter, his lone radio network appearance. This was also Gary Lee's final year on the radio network.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer with Tom Sneva as analyst. Longtime color commentator Bobby Unser left ABC, while Danny Sullivan was reassigned to cover CART races exclusively and would no longer be with the broadcast. This would be Page's final 500 for the next three years. After the 1998 season, Page would move exclusively to CART series broadcasts while being replaced in 1999 by soon to be former voice of the 500 Bob Jenkins.\nFor the first time since the early 1980s, one of the pit reporters (Gary Gerould) rode in the pace car, reporting live at the start of the race. During the broadcast itself, Brent Musburger had a small role as \"Wide World of Sports\" studio host.\nAt the track itself, the Speedway broadcast the race live on a special targeted signal, intended to be picked up by television sets within the radius of the grounds. This was the first and only time this special signal has been used.\nPractice and time trials were carried over three networks: ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2. "

        "title": "1997 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 81st Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana over three days, May 25–27, 1997. It was originally scheduled for Sunday May 25, however, rain washed out all activities for the day. The race was started on Monday May 26, but rain halted the race after only 15 laps had been completed. On Tuesday May 27, the race was resumed, and was run to completion. The rain delay, as well as two controversies (one during time trials, and one during the race), put a damper on the month. Arie Luyendyk won the race from the pole position, his second Indy victory. Treadway Racing, in only their second season of competition, finished 1st-2nd with Luyendyk and teammate Scott Goodyear. The team became the first to sweep the top two finishing position at Indianapolis since Leader Cards in 1962.\nIt was the second Indianapolis 500 held as part of the USAC-sanctioned Indy Racing League, and was part of the 1996-97 Indy Racing League season. It marked the introduction of a new production-based, normally aspirated engine formula as well as a new chassis design. The new engine formula resulted in a substantial drop in speeds compared to the previous year, and the chassis were noticeably different in many aspects - both visually, and mechanically.\nA controversy during qualifying saw two bumped cars re-added to the starting field after the close of time trials, thus the starting grid was made up of 35 cars. It was the first time since 1979, and only the second time since 1933 that more than the traditional 33 cars comprised the starting grid. While the field had been expanded, a crash during the pace lap eliminated three cars. Two additional cars failed to start the race due to mechanical problems, and only 29 cars took the green flag.\nWith two laps to go in the race, polesitter Arie Luyendyk led teammate Scott Goodyear. A caution came out on the 199th lap after Tony Stewart brushed the turn four wall. The pace car did not come out to pack-up the field. Drivers and crews expected the race would finish under the caution. Without warning, the green and white flag were displayed at the starter's stand on the final lap, signifying the track was back to racing conditions. None of the cars in the field were prepared for the restart, and yellow lights around the course remained illuminated for many seconds afterwards. Luyendyk held on to win, but controversy erupted regarding the officials' poor handling of the situation. This last-lap incident, followed by a major scoring snafu two weeks later at Texas, led to the USAC being permanently removed from sanctioning the IRL and Indy 500, in favor of in-house officiating.\nThe win by Arie Luyendyk marked the milestone 50th Indianapolis 500 victory for Firestone. It was Luyendyk's second Indy victory (he also won in 1990), as well as Scott Goodyear's second runner-up finish (1992). It was the third time in his career that Goodyear narrowly lost the Indy 500 in the closing stages. Luyendyk became the first driver since A. J. Foyt to win the race with both a turbocharged and a normally-aspirated engine.\nRace schedule.\nThe 1997 race utilized the traditional three week / four weekend schedule that had been in use since the mid-1970s. Practice started on the Saturday 22 days prior to the race, and four days of time trials were utilized. With changes to the schedule in subsequent years, 1997 would be the final year that used the 23-day month of May schedule. It was also the final year that used the traditional \nfour days of time trials, along with the original four-day qualifying format that had dated back to 1952.\nA few days before the race, a fire swept through the storage hangar housing the floats for the 500 Festival Parade, and threatened to cancel the parade scheduled for Saturday May 24 downtown. Only four floats were spared, and Buddy Lazier's 1996 winning car escaped the fire only because the museum had decided to wait a few extra days before delivering it to the float staging area. The parade went on as scheduled, but in a slightly retooled format.\nBackground.\nNew engine and chassis package.\nNew engines and new cars arrived at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for 1997. In 1996, it was announced that all races of the Indy Racing League would switch to a normally aspirated production-based formula starting in January 1997. In addition, a new contingent of chassis rules accompanied the powerplants. All engines for 1997 would be 4.0 L, 32-valve production-based engines. There would be two manufacturers involved, Oldsmobile Aurora (L47) and Nissan Infiniti (VH). The chassis were constructed by Dallara and G-Force. Riley &amp; Scott also was selected as a chassis manufacturer, but they were not yet ready for competition.\nThe changes were in the interest of cutting costs, lowering speeds, and bringing the racing closer together. After setting an all-time track record of over 237 mph a year earlier, Arie Luyendyk's best qualifying lap in 1997 would drop to 217 mph. The new chassis had many visible differences, most noticeably the airbox above the engine cowling, larger wings, taller sidepods, and an overall bulkier appearance. The new cars produced more downforce than the previous machines, changing the driving characteristics.\nWith turbochargers legislated out of the series, the 1997 race was the first since the early 1960s to feature a full field of piston-powered, normally aspirated powerplants. The new crossplane crankshaft engines were also much louder than their turbocharged, flat-plane crank counterparts, leading some fans and media to compare them to the sound of NASCAR engines.\nTrack changes.\nThe track was repaved in the fall of 1995. Following the 1996 Brickyard 400, the apexes of the four turns were breaking up. Over the offseason, track crews repaved the apexes of the turns with a different compound of asphalt. The result was a better surface, but a visibly darker area in the apexes of all four turns.\nContinuing split from CART.\nThe ongoing IRL/CART split continued into its second year, and no teams from the CART ranks entered at Indianapolis. With the new IRL chassis and engine rules for 1997, the two series now had substantially different and incompatible equipment. CART-based teams that wished to enter the Indy 500 would henceforth be required to purchase all new cars and engines, and few if any had the interest or the budget to do so. The alternative U.S. 500, however, was cancelled after only one running. Instead of running another race the same day as the Indy 500, CART teams participated in the Motorola 300 at the newly opened Gateway International Raceway on Saturday May 24, the day before the Indy 500 was scheduled.\nThe only CART-based team from 1996 that raced at Indy was Galles Racing, which had switched full-time to the IRL during the winter. Robby Gordon, a CART regular from 1992 to 1996, moved to NASCAR in 1997 to drive for Team SABCO, and owner Felix Sabates arranged for Gordon to attempt the \"Double Duty\", planning to race at Indy and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. The effort was well-funded, and received considerable media attention. Gordon and Scott Goodyear, who had switched to full-time IRL competition with newcomers Panther Racing, became the first drivers to come back to the Speedway among the 22 starters from 1995 that had not entered the 1996 event; only ten of those 22 would eventually race again at Indy.\nOn April 11, during a public meeting, Indy Racing League's executive director Leo Mehl stated that CART had pressured in previous years to reduce the Indianapolis 500 to a three-day race, and emphasized that \"is a myth that the other side has all the top drivers and you don't have to look very far back into recent history to see a demonstration of that myth. IRL has plenty of top stars to showcase once the press ends its infatuation with propagating opinion instead of facts\". Mehl also quoted the creation of the IRL as \"necessary\", because of stagnant television ratings, NASCAR's rise and the increasing flux of grassroots open wheel drivers into stock car racing.\n1996–97 IRL season.\nFor its first season, the IRL schedule was situated such that the Indianapolis 500 would be the final race of the season. That provided that the IRL champion would be crowned at the conclusion of the Indianapolis 500 - and could possibly even be the Indy 500 winner. The arrangement proved unusual, and ultimately disruptive. The second season of the IRL, referred to as the 1996–97 season, was originally scheduled to begin at Loudon in August 1996, and conclude with the 1997 Indy 500 in May 1997.\nIn October 1996, league officials announced that the series would revert to a traditional calendar-based season. To aid the transition, the 1996–97 season would include the two races run in late 1996, and all races run in the calendar year of 1997. The Indianapolis 500 would no longer serve as the season finale.\n25/8 Rule and locked-in entries.\nFor the second year in a row, 25 of the 33 starting grid positions for the Indianapolis 500 were set aside for the top 25 cars in the 1996-97 season IRL points standings. Known as the \"25/8 Rule\", the controversial arrangement was introduced during the 1996 IRL season and had been a key issue among CART teams in their decision to boycott the 1996 race. IRL officials, however, argued that the rule had already served its purpose of guaranteeing a starting field for other races on the IRL schedule, leaving the door open for its eventual demise in 1998. This was eventually confirmed during the month.\nThe format (similar in practice to NASCAR's Top 35 rule introduced years later) provided that the top 25 entries in owner points (not drivers) were guaranteed a \"locked-in\" starting position, and could not be bumped, provided they completed a four-lap qualifying run over a minimum prescribed speed. Officials set 203 mph as the minimum. The grid would still be arranged by speed rank. The remaining eight positions would be filled by non-top 25 entries, and bumping could only occur among those eight positions and the non-top 25 participants.\nThe #15 and the #74 entries, both raced at the first two races of the 1996-97 season, never appeared during the month of May. Della Penna Motorsports had left the Indy Racing League at the end of calendar year 1996 to compete in CART, while Tempero-Giuffre Racing stayed away from the track despite entering an Infiniti-powered G-Force. Therefore, only 23 of the 25 eligible \"locked-in\" entries were present to accept their berth, and ten at-large starting positions were up for grabs at the onset of qualifying.\nEntry list.\nThe entry list was published on April 21. The 22 cars that had run the first two rounds of the 1997 year were entered, including the #17 Chitwood Motorsports entry, with Affonso Giaffone having been confirmed for the rest of the season, and the #30 McCormack Motorsports car, initially unassigned as Jeret Schroeder hadn't yet struck a financial deal with the team. Out of those 22 cars, only the #16 (Blueprint Racing) and the #50 (EuroInternational) were at-large entries.\nApart from Robby Gordon's entry, eight further driver/car combinations were registered: Eliseo Salazar, back in his full-time ride with Team Scandia, and Lyn St. James were making comeback bids from their injuries, as well as Alessandro Zampedri, who was confirmed back in December and would also stay on Scandia afterwards. Jeff Ward, who failed to qualify for the 1995 race, was signed to drive for Team Cheever's second entry on April 10, while the release of the entry list confirmed the participation of two Indy car debutants: Vincenzo Sospiri, the 1995 Formula 3000 champion and brief Formula 1 driver for the failed MasterCard Lola team, and Greg Ray, third in the 1994 Atlantic Championship and 12th in the previous Indy Lights season. Ray was run by Knapp Motorsports, a spin-off team of the Genoa Racing outfit that was competing in Indy Lights.\nBesides, Tyce Carlson was entered by PDM Racing in their second car, and Gary Bettenhausen was announced as the driver of the #81 car, an at-large entry fielded by newcomers Terhune-Barnets Racing and run by LP Racing, in an attempt to make his 22nd Indy 500 start. However, on April 25 he was replaced on the entry list by Mark Dismore, backed by Kelley Automotive Group, who had placed orders on the yet-to-be-delivered chassis from Riley &amp; Scott the previous year.\nThe team also parted ways with LP Racing and his crew chief Larry Nash, and made a deal with PDM Racing to run the car as his second entry, the #28, which had a locked-in berth. This move left Tyce Carlson out of the ride. Tom Kelley became the owner of the car by the time practice had begun and the deal with PDM lasted through the season, after which Kelley Racing would become a fully independent entity in 1998. Stefan Johansson originally planned to race in his own entry, but he gave up earlier in the year due to an injury sustained in a fire at his home, as well as financing issues. Scott Harrington was entered as his driver in late April.\nPractice (week 1).\nSaturday May 3 - Opening Day.\nThe first day of practice, set aside for Rookie Orientation, was rained out.\nSunday May 4 - Rookie Orientation.\nThe first day of track activity saw six rookies take laps, with Vincenzo Sospiri leading the speed chart at 211.964 mph. Jack Miller blew an engine, in what was the only remarkable incident of the day. Robbie Groff also took laps for McCormack Motorsports, as the former Indy Lights driver, with two CART races under his belt back in 1994, had struck a deal to drive with the team, in detriment of Jeret Schroeder.\nIn a press conference, Team Menard confirmed that Tony Stewart would continue with the team for the remainder of the 1996-97 season year and for 1998. The lengthening of the season, devised to switch to a calendar schedule for 1998, meant a new deal had to be reached in order for Stewart to finalize his NASCAR Busch Series outings. Stewart had already signed a full-season deal with Joe Gibbs Racing for 1998, and had his sights in a Winston Cup ride for 1999. Menard also confirmed a switch from Firestone to Goodyear tires.\nMonday May 5 - Rookie Orientation.\nA very windy day saw minimal activity, with only four cars taking a total of 80 laps before rain closed the track at 4:30 p.m. Kenny Bräck turned the fastest lap at 205.597 mph.\nTuesday May 6.\nThe first full day of practice saw heavy activity. Arie Luyendyk set the fastest lap thus far of the month at 5:24 p.m., at 218.707 mph. The only incident of the day occurred early on, when rookie Jeff Ward blew an engine and spun into the wall in turn 3.\nLater on, five rookies (Kenny Bräck, Robbie Groff, Greg Ray, Vincenzo Sospiri and Affonso Giaffone) completed their rookie test, and Sinden Racing Services confirmed that Steve Kinser, a 14-times World of Outlaws sprint car champion, would drive their #44 at-large entry. Kinser had tried to qualify for the race 15 years earlier, when a practice crash ended his chances in 1981, and had never competed in an Indy car race.\nJohn Andretti, a seven times-Indianapolis 500 starter between 1988 and 1994, passed the mandatory physical exam. Andretti, who switched to NASCAR Winston Cup in 1994 and was driving for Cale Yarborough Motorsports, had expressed an interest in doing the Double Duty for the second time.\nWednesday May 7.\nArie Luyendyk became the first and only driver to go over 220 mph during the month, with a lap of 220.297 mph. At 4:12 p.m., Scott Sharp crashed in turn 1, heavily damaging his primary car. He had just run a lap of 217.402 mph.\nLyn St. James's 34 laps were her first on a race car since her collision at the previous year's Indy 500, as her broken right wrist had healed improperly. Rain closed the track about 10 minutes early.\nThursday May 8.\nRain kept the track closed until 3 p.m., and the final three hours saw average activity, including the first laps for Steve Kinser and Stéphan Grégoire. Just minutes after the track opened, Arie Luyendyk spun in the southchute, and tagged the wall, suffering minor nose cone damage. He was uninjured. Later, Luyendyk returned to the track, and once again, led the speed chart at 217.318 mph.\nIn the later stages of the day, Alessandro Zampedri's car caught fire, having blown an engine coming out of Turn 4. After struggling to compete for the top spots during two days of practice with Goodyear tires, Team Menard switched back to mounting compounds from Firestone. Right away, Tony Stewart and Robbie Buhl were able to challenge Luyendyk's lap times, ending the session just behind him.\n\"Fast\" Friday May 9.\nThe final day of practice before pole qualifying saw heavy action, and cool temperatures. The speed chart was competitive, with Arie Luyendyk, Tony Stewart, and Robbie Buhl trading fast lap for the afternoon. At the end of the day, Luyendyk was fastest, sweeping the chart all four days of veteran practice. His lap of 218.325 mph was a mile per hour faster than Stewart in second place.\nTwo incidents, however, overshadowed the action. At 12:42 p.m., John Paul Jr. crashed in Turn 4, and suffered a broken lower right leg and a broken left heel. With 43 minutes left, Scott Sharp also crashed exiting Turn 4, and suffered a concussion. Sharp had been knocked unconscious in the crash with his foot on the throttle, and the destroyed car kept going for a while in the front stretch alongside the outside wall with its wheels spinning. Both Paul and Sharp would be forced to sit out the rest of the month. In another incident, Stéphan Grégoire's car suffered minor damage against the inside guard rail after a spin in the warm-up lane.\nDuring the day, Jack Miller, Steve Kinser and Sam Schmidt passed the final phases of their rookie tests, Jeff Ward completed his 20-lap refresher test, and driver-owner Eddie Cheever turned his first laps of the month, having concentrated so far in getting Ward's car up to speed. EuroInternational also completed their first laps with Billy Roe, albeit at a slow speed. With them, 30 of the 32 confirmed car-driver combinations had taken to the track before Pole Day qualifying, the exceptions being Mark Dismore due to the lateness of the ownership and crew switch in the #28 entry, and Scott Harrington, as Johansson Motorsports saw its Oldsmobile engine deal being scuppered.\nBesides Harrington, some Oldsmobile entries were experiencing engine shortages. After Jim Guthrie had a timing chain failure, Blueprint Racing was left with no powerplants available, as the three engines they had put a deposit on had not been delivered. Team Menard refused to supply them, having previously committed to Steve Kinser for technical assistance. Other Aurora-supplied teams also faced similar issues, like Team Scandia, which was switching their few engines between their entries.\nTime trials (weekend 1).\nPole Day - Saturday May 10.\nPole day time trials took place under mostly sunny skies, but cool temperatures, which forced the Pole Day morning practice to be delayed due to low track temperature for the first time in history. Tony Stewart led the charts at 219.085 mph.\nAfter two days of on-truck struggles in the 209 mph range, Hemelgarn Racing announced Saturday morning that Buddy Lazier would use Oldsmobile powerplants instead of Infiniti's, citing a lack of speed and sponsor deference. Due to contractual obligations on fielding a second Infiniti engine, the team entered Johnny Unser to drive in Lazier's car, renumbered as #90, while Lazier would qualify with his back-up. Because of the shortages being faced from Oldsmobile, their first Aurora engine was loaned by driver-owner Stan Wattles, whose upstart operation Metro Racing Systems was yet in the planning process.\nThe first car out on the track to qualify was Mike Groff. He became the first driver to complete a run in a normally aspirated car since 1987, and the first to qualify one since 1984. His speed also tentatively broke existing normally aspirated, stock block, track records with an average of 208.537 mph. A total of nine cars went out for runs during the first segment, however, only five were run to completion. Jeff Ward sat on the provisional pole at 214.517 mph, which would eventually be good for seventh on the grid.\nShortly after 3 p.m., Arie Luyendyk took to the track, and began the second wave of qualifiers. His run of 218.263 mph put him firmly on the pole position, with Tony Stewart close behind at 218.021 mph. Rookie Vincenzo Sospiri surprised many by rounding out the front row at 216.822 mph, beating Robbie Buhl, who qualified on his third attempt, Scott Goodyear and Jim Guthrie, who was on a popularity peak after his surprise Phoenix 200 win and had run competitively during the week. Guthrie had been able to qualify after a long overnight rebuild of his lone engine.\nWith his new engine, Buddy Lazier substantially improved his pace to qualify in the top 10. There were several wave offs during qualifying attempts, and three drivers didn't got to complete theirs. Robbie Groff brushed the wall at the exit of Turn 1 in his second lap and had to wave off, Fermín Vélez blew an engine during his second lap, and Sam Schmidt spun on the warm-up lane, hitting the inside wall. Also, Eliseo Salazar had to wave off his first qualifying attempt after hitting a bird on Lap 3.\nAt the end of pole day, 21 cars were in the field, with Roberto Guerrero slowest thus far at just over 207 mph. The Colombian qualified with his back-up car, which left him without his locked-in status, but Pagan's team manager John Barnes had petitioned for it to become the primary car while it was already in the qualifying lane. The change was not made before Guerrero took to the track, but USAC allowed it to be considered as a primary car the following day, securing Guerrero's place in the grid. That decision put Alessandro Zampedri in an early bubble among the at-large entries, having qualified at barely 209 mph. A week later, during Bump Day, USAC allowed a similar change to Buddy Lazier's car at the request of Ron Hemelgarn, despite being safely in the field at 214.286 mph.\nSecond Day - Sunday May 11.\nAs the majority of drivers had qualified by Saturday, only four machines started qualifying attempts on the second day. Two of them were added to the field; Steve Kinser completed a run early in the day, while Robbie Groff finished just before the track closed in his last attempt. The first one was nullified by an engine misfire, and the second, by a cold track surface. Greg Ray, in an at-large entry, was set for a 215 mph qualifying run before he ran out of fuel in his last lap. The priority in engine usage at Team Scandia forced Marco Greco to become the only available first-week competitor to sit out during Pole Day weekend.\nIn the morning, Dennis Vitolo was assigned to the #54 Beck Motorsports entry, which had a locked-in berth after being raced by Robbie Buhl in the last two rounds of 1996. Billy Boat, who failed to qualify in 1996 and was yet to debut in an Indy car race, had been recruited on Friday to drive Foyt's third car, and took to the track for the first time in the #1T car. Boat even took warm up laps for a tentative late qualifying attempt, with the only purpose of checking some changes to the car. Despite this, his deal had been agreed before Sharp's injury, and he was not slated to replace him.\nPractice (week 2).\nMonday May 12.\nAnother cool and windy day saw 18 cars practice. Arie Luyendyk continued his dominance, and led the practice chart for the seventh consecutive day before sitting out for the rest of the week. He did not come back on track until Bump Day practice, which he also led. Billy Boat was able to complete his refresher test, while Billy Roe became the ninth driver to pass his rookie test.\nOff the track, A. J. Foyt announced that he was working on a deal for John Andretti to replace the injured Scott Sharp in the #1 entry, providing that travel and scheduling constraints were arranged with his NASCAR team owner Cale Yarborough. Johansson Motorsports confirmed they would use an Infiniti engine provided by Hemelgarn Racing, after plans to run an Oldsmobile engine for Scott Harrington fell through.\nTuesday May 13.\nTen drivers turned their fastest laps of the month, including Buddy Lazier, who led the speed chart, and Billy Boat, the fastest of the non-qualified cars. At over 214 mph, Boat was four miles per hour faster than the others, including Dennis Vitolo, who blew an engine before getting up to speed.\nA. J. Foyt conceded defeat in his intentions to bring John Andretti as a driver, as his NASCAR commitment with Cale Yarborough would not provide enough travel time to make it to the Coca-Cola 600. Johnny O'Connell was named to replace Scott Sharp in the #1 car, and PDM Racing confirmed Tyce Carlson to replace the injured John Paul Jr. in the #18 car. Carlson had run two races with the team in 1996, and had been scheduled to make the Indy 500 in the #28 until Mark Dismore's deal was arranged in late April.\nWednesday May 14.\nBuddy Lazier and Billy Boat repeated their efforts from the previous day, as the fastest already-qualified, and fastest non-qualified cars of the day. High winds blew debris onto the track causing several yellow lights throughout the afternoon.\nThursday May 15.\nMost of the cars that took to the track were among those not yet qualified. Several veterans sat out the afternoon. Sam Schmidt found his way to the top of the speed chart, at over 211 mph. His team, Blueprint Racing, confirmed a third entry for Claude Bourbonnais, the 1993 Atlantic Championship runner-up and fourth in the 1996 Indy Lights season, who had run five CART races in 1994. Bourbonnais was due to take over Jim Guthrie's back-up car.\nLike the Canadian, Johnny Unser and Johnny O'Connell run laps over 200 mph, also taking to the track for the first time all month, as well as Mark Dismore and his new teammate Tyce Carlson, who passed his refresher test. In a windy day, both drivers got to do laps in the 210 mph range early in the day before parking the cars early, as PDM Racing was out of spare engines.\nFriday May 16.\nThe final full day of practice saw heavy activity among qualified and non-qualified drivers. With Arie Luyendyk still absent, Tony Stewart led the speed chart. During the first hour, Johnny O'Connell lost an engine and crashed hard in the southchute. He dislocated his left foot and was ruled out for the weekend, becoming the second Foyt driver to be sidelined during the month. Later that afternoon, Claude Bourbonnais was the tenth and last driver to complete his rookie test, and Scott Harrington finally took his first laps of the month.\nAmong the un-qualified cars, both Greg Ray and Fermín Vélez went back on-track for the first time since Pole Day weekend. Meanwhile, the three already qualified drivers from Team Scandia sat out the whole week of practice because of the lingering engine parts shortages, including Alessandro Zampedri despite his bubble spot. This reduced running for both Marco Greco and Vélez to a combined 47 laps. Similar issues also kept Jim Guthrie out of the track during the week. Up to six locked-in entries were yet to qualify, and the remaining seven un-qualified cars were set to battle on time trials, as well as the slower at-large qualifiers of Pole Day weekend (Steve Kinser, Lyn St. James and Zampedri), as four open spots were still up for grabs.\nOff the track, the Indy Racing League confirmed the technical specifications for 1998 and beyond, which included the elimination of the 25/8 Rule, that had grown in controversy beyond its alleged CART-blocking purposes. During the week, competitors and officials alike were growing apprehensive of the rule, as it became increasingly possible that the \"fastest 33 cars\", a cornerstone Indy tradition, could not necessarily make the field. At-large entries were expected to be over 210 mph to make the race, while four locked-in entries had settled with just being over the 203 mph minimum speed required. There had also been some disconformity with some teams that were selling, or trying to sell, their locked-in berths.\nTime trials (weekend 2).\nThird Day - Saturday May 17.\nThe third day of qualifying saw sunny skies and warm temperatures. A busy day of time trials saw the field fill to 31 cars. Billy Boat set the early pace with an average of 215.544 mph, sixth fastest on the whole grid and faster than team leader Davey Hamilton. Several \"locked-in\" drivers took runs, and within an hour, eight consecutive time trials were run to completion, including another 215 mph run by Sam Schmidt which closely mirrored that of the sister car of Jim Guthrie. Johnny Unser couldn't attempt to qualify after a piston failed in the morning practice, Greg Ray suffered an engine failure during his warm-up lap and Claude Bourbonnais, looking to qualify on the later stages of the day, damaged his car after tagging the wall twice.\nWhen the track closed for the day, only two positions were unfilled, and 22 of the 23 original \"locked-in\" entries were already in the field. The only original \"locked-in\" entry yet unqualified was the #1 of A. J. Foyt Enterprises, which had no driver after the injuries suffered by Scott Sharp and Johnny O'Connell. Foyt had previously discarded using that berth for Boat, and told reporters he would not sign another replacement driver, reducing the number of cars yet to qualify on Bump Day to just four.\nBump Day - Sunday May 18.\nGoing into the final day of qualifying, two positions were open. One final \"locked-in\" position was available (Foyt's #1), as 22 of the 23 eligible cars had already completed their runs. Once the field was filled to 33 cars, the ten \"non-exempt\" positions were all up for grabs among the at-large entries. On Bump Day morning, several non-exempt teams were uneasy about their chances of making the field, despite their speeds being amongst the fastest 33. Despite his earlier remarks about not qualifying the #1 car, Foyt sent team driver Davey Hamilton out to shake the car down.\nIn the first fifteen minutes, Johnny Unser (209.344 mph) and Greg Ray (213.760 mph) filled the field to 33 cars with at-large entries. Since 22 of the cars were locked-in, they put Alessandro Zampedri on the bubble. Zampedri had qualified 19th on pole day with a 209.09 mph, and was the 28th-fastest car on speed at the time, ahead of five \"locked-in\" cars.\nAt 11.30 a.m., Paul Durant secured a drive in the #1 Foyt car, the final entry eligible for a locked-in position. Durant, who had not run during the whole month, climbed into the car for the first time at 12:17 p.m., and was safely in the field by 1:09 p.m. His qualifying average of 209.149 mph bumped Zampedri from the field of 33. Durant's only previous IRL experience consisted of two early retirements in 1996, one of them at the Indy 500.\nJohnny Unser was now on the bubble with the 26th-fastest car in the field, as the slowest at-large entry. At 2:08 p.m., Claude Bourbonnais easily bumped out Unser with a 210.523 mph qualifying attempt, and put Lyn St. James on the bubble. She had qualified 16th on pole day, was 25th-fastest overall and the fastest Infiniti-powered car, but the eight cars below her were locked-in. Immediately after Bourbonnais's attempt, and with rain approaching, Alessandro Zampedri took to the track in his back-up car. His run of 211.757 mph was enough to bump St. James, and put Bourbonnais on the bubble.\nMinutes later, rain began to fall and closed the track for the next hour. Despite being bumped, Hemelgarn Racing (which fielded both Unser and St. James) were making no effort to bring their cars back out on the track to re-qualify. In a 2017 interview, St. James told that she confronted IRL official Leo Mehl about the situation, but received an inattentive response. She also pleaded with car owner Ron Hemelgarn, who seemed to her as \"curiously unconcerned\". Rumors had already begun circulating around the garage area that USAC officials were considering reinstating bumped cars to the field, which was relayed on the ESPN broadcast.\nThe track was dried and re-opened at 3:15 p.m, with Scott Harrington as the lone car preparing to qualify. Unable to go over 200 mph during practice on Saturday, Johansson Motorsports took possession of Davey Hamilton's back-up chassis from Foyt, and changed its number to #36 to make it their primary car. With just 25 practice laps in the car, Harrington got out to qualify at 5:51 p.m, with nine minutes left in the day. After a quick first lap of 214.061 mph, he crashed heavily after losing control in the middle of turn 2. Harrington, who was extricated from his car, was awake and alert, and was transferred to Methodist Hospital, but was not seriously injured.\nPost-qualifying controversy.\nWhen the gun was fired at 6 p.m., teammates Lyn St. James and Johnny Unser were the lone two drivers to have been bumped out of the starting field. Both of them, like Alessandro Zampedri before he managed to re-qualify, had posted qualifying speeds among the fastest 33 cars, which were also faster than eight of the \"locked-in\" entries.\nUSAC officials had previously expressed their concern that, due to the soon-to-be-abandoned '25/8 rule', the fastest 33 cars would not be starting the race. Eventually, a decision was made that afternoon to reinstate any at-large entries that were bumped, provided they were among the \"fastest 33\" cars overall. The ruling added St. James and Unser back to the field, being placed in the 34th and 35th starting positions, respectively., making both the first drivers since George Snider and Bill Vukovich II in 1979 to start from the 12th row at an Indianapolis 500.\nScott Harrington was the lone driver that failed to qualify for the race. Unaware of the developing situation during Bump Day, Harrington could've been among the 33 fastest drivers just by beating Dennis Vitolo, who had qualified at a mere 207.626 mph, three miles per hour slower than Bourbonnais's bubble speed, and well below what Harrington was running at the time of his crash. However, it is unknown if Harrington would've been reinstated in that case; while USAC's decision was taken to ensure that the 33 fastest drivers would start the race, the official ruling stated that only bumped cars were eligible for the procedure.\nIt was the first Indy 500 field since 1979 that had exceeded the traditional 33-car grid. It featured the second highest rookie field since 1930 with 13 rookies, only behind the previous year's race. With nine of the 17 rookies from 1996 also on the field, only 13 drivers had taken part in the Indianapolis 500 before the formation of the IRL.\nCarburetion Day.\nFinal practice - Thursday May 22.\nTony Stewart turned the fastest lap of the day, at 215.502 mph., while polesitter Arie Luyendyk completed only two laps at speed, using the session mostly as a system check exercise.\nRobby Gordon blew an engine, while Dennis Vitolo, Marco Greco and Paul Durant experienced mechanical trouble.\nPit Stop Contest.\nThe Coors Indy Pit Stop Challenge featured eight teams competing for a $40,000 top prize. The Indianapolis 500 pole sitter (Arie Luyendyk) was automatically qualified, and four entries were selected through an \"Indy Racing League program\" at Walt Disney World (Marco Greco in Scandia's #22; Jim Guthrie in Blueprint's #27) and Phoenix (Davey Hamilton in Foyt's #14; Stéphan Grégoire in Chastain's #77).\nThe last three places were determined in a preliminary round on May 12, with 7 entries against the clock in a single-run format. Kenny Bräck (with a time of 12.597 seconds), Robby Gordon (13.721 seconds) and Eddie Cheever (14.409 seconds) gained access to the competition, defeating Steve Kinser (14.721 seconds), Jeff Ward (15.447 seconds), Jack Miller (17.245 seconds) and Roberto Guerrero, who failed to register a time. However, both Hamilton and Grégoire's entries were withdrawn by Foyt and Chastain from the competition, allowing Kinser and Ward to take part in the event.\nGalles Racing and driver Kenny Bräck defeated Team Cheever with driver/owner Eddie Cheever in the finals.\nSystem check runs.\nOn Saturday May 24, the day before the race, arrangements were made for a special practice session. Due to the new engine package, some teams had requested additional track time for system check runs. A very brief green light period, with a 190 mph speed limit, was conducted for five cars.\nRain delay.\nSunday May 25.\nThe race was originally scheduled for 11 a.m. EST on Sunday May 25. Rain in the morning delayed the activities, but the skies appeared to lighten, and the cars were placed in the grid at 11:45 a.m. At 12 p.m., the skies opened up, and heavy rain began to fall. The cars were wheeled back to the garage area. At 1:30 p.m., track officials rescheduled the race for Monday.\nRobby Gordon, driving for Felix Sabates' Team SABCO, had planned on driving the Indy 500/Coca-Cola 600 \"Double Duty\". At 1:45 p.m., Gordon left the grounds, and flew to Charlotte. The Coca-Cola 600 also suffered a rain delay, but did eventually see the green flag fall. Gordon wrecked out on lap 186, and finished 41st.\nMonday May 26.\nOn Memorial Day, Monday May 26, the race was scheduled for 11 a.m. EST. Skies were partly cloudy in the morning, but there was no rain at the time. The pre-race ceremonies were held on-time, but some subtle changes were made. The Purdue Band was unable to return for Monday, and therefore Florence Henderson's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was done a cappella. In addition, \"Taps\" was played by a local musician as a substitute. The most noteworthy change, however, was the absence of Jim Nabors. He had left the grounds Sunday night, and was not present to sing the traditional \"Back Home Again in Indiana\". At his request, a recording from a previous year (1993) was played for the fans. Mari Hulman George followed, officially taking over the family tradition (from her mother Mary F. Hulman) of delivering the starting command. Mary F. Hulman had been inducted into the Auto Racing Hall of Fame earlier in the month, but was in declining health. Also absent was longtime Speedway public address announcer John Totten, who had fallen ill.\nOn the first parade lap, Dr. Jack Miller got sideways with cold tires and nearly spun in turn 4. He continued, and rejoined the field. On the final pace lap, all three cars of the fifth row, Stéphan Grégoire, Affonso Giaffone, and Kenny Bräck came together in Turn 4, and crashed out of the race. TV replays proved inconclusive to determine the cause of the accident, but a fan recording from the grandstands showed that Bräck had forced down Giaffone, whose left front tyre touched with Grégoire's car, turning him sideways and triggering the 3-car incident. The start, therefore, was delayed by five extra pace laps. Afterwards, Robbie Groff stalled on the backstretch, and Sam Schmidt and Alessandro Zampedri ducked into the pits with mechanical trouble before the race was started. As such, only 30 of the 35 cars on the grid started the race.\nArie Luyendyk led the field to the green flag, but Tony Stewart slipstreamed past him after Turn 4 to lead the first lap. Team Menard would later register an official complaint over Luyendyk's start, after Stewart argued that Luyendyk had tried to crowd him towards the outside wall. During these first laps, Vincenzo Sospiri was overtaken by Robbie Buhl and a fast starting Robby Gordon, who climbed eight spots in only two laps. Jim Guthrie also passed Sospiri and briefly pressured Gordon, but at the end of the sixth lap he pulled into the pits with a sizeable water leak. Also, Eddie Cheever fell down the order after pitting because of a stuck gearbox.\nOn Lap 10, Claude Bourbonnais, running in 26th place, blew his engine, the three Blueprint Racing drivers having fallen by the wayside with mechanical issues after the team worked on their engines for the whole week. Moments after the caution came out, a light drizzle started falling around the track. During the caution, Guthrie's crew frantically tried to fix the leak, but he lost seven laps. On lap 15, the rain started to fall harder, and the race was red flagged. With rain continuing to fall, the cars returned to the garage area at 12:30 p.m., and fans began to leave the grounds. The race had to go at least 101 laps to be considered official; with only 15 laps completed, the race would have to be resumed.\nAfter negotiations between IMS, series officials, and television executives, the decision was made at 2:15 p.m. to resume the race on Lap 16 the following day, Tuesday May 27 at 11 a.m. The arrangement was similar to the one that occurred during the 1973 Indianapolis 500, and differed from a similar situation during the 1986 race. Many expected the conclusion of the race to be postponed until Saturday, May 31, but the officials agreed that, due to the upcoming race at Texas and the good forecast for Tuesday, it was in the best interest to finish the race as soon as possible.\nTuesday May 27.\nWith skies finally clearing, the race finally was able to get underway. Mari Hulman George delivered the \"re-start\" command at 11 a.m., and the race resumed at lap 16. Of the 35 qualifiers, 29 cars lined up single-file for the restart. The grandstands were only partially full, and it marked the first time since 1973 that the race was held mid-week. ABC-TV made a special arrangement to cover the race live as planned.\nRace running.\nRe-start.\nThe race picked up single-file from the pits at lap 16. The first two laps were run under caution as warm-up laps, however, they counted towards the race total. On lap 18, the green flag came out with Tony Stewart resuming the lead against a very bunched-up field. Robby Gordon was practically alongside Robbie Buhl when the green flag dropped, stripped him of the 3rd place and rapidly closed up on Arie Luyendyk on the backstretch, but he suddenly veered to the warm-up lane in Turn 3, as his engine had caught fire. Gordon jumped out of the car, with his driver's suit burning from leaked methanol in the cockpit, and began rolling vigorously in the grass to put the fire out.\nThe caution came out, and the car was returned to the pits, with Gordon still willing to drive, but he had to retire from the race with first and second-degree burns on his wrists and right thigh, for which he would miss an entire month of Winston Cup competition. This would eventually lead to Gordon being released at the end of the year, after falling out of grace with Felix Sabates, who later said that his team would not be back to the Indy 500, being displeased with the attitude of the paddock and the style of Indy car racing.\nAs the field lined up for the restart on Lap 23, four cars tangled in turn 4. Steve Kinser, up to 10th place, misjudged the procedure and tagged Eliseo Salazar from behind. In the ensuing avoiding measures, Mark Dismore slowed down in 13th place, only to be rear-ended by Roberto Guerrero, retiring on the spot. Salazar and Guerrero would lose laps with extensive repairs, but Kinser only had to replace his front wing. The first significant green flag racing of the week finally began at Lap 28, with Stewart leading Luyendyk and Buhl. Jeff Ward and Buddy Lazier were fourth and fifth in front of Vincenzo Sospiri and Scott Goodyear, having gained two and four positions respectively on the previous restart.\nFirst half.\nArie Luyendyk tried to pass Tony Stewart on the inside, but couldn't complete the move. The lost momentum allowed Robbie Buhl to pass him in Turn 3, and even Buddy Lazier, after passing Jeff Ward, had a chance to attack the pole-sitter. The top 4 drivers soon pulled away from their competitors, with Stewart maintaining a 2-second lead and Luyendyk repassing Buhl on Lap 44. The leaders made their first pit stop around Lap 50, when Team Menard discovering they had no telemetry read from Stewart's car. On Lap 59, Jim Guthrie brought out the yellow, as his engine finally gave up. Vincenzo Sospiri had pitted earlier than anyone else, but had to make an unscheduled pit stop during the caution because of a malfunctioning fuel alarm. He rejoined in 10th place as the last car in the lead lap, behind Scott Goodyear, Buzz Calkins, a recovering Eddie Cheever and Davey Hamilton.\nOn the Lap 62 restart, Luyendyk jumped to the front, putting a 4-second lead over Stewart in 13 laps. Buhl and Lazier ran nose-to-tail within 10 seconds of Luyendyk, while the other lead lap drivers had fallen at least 20 seconds behind. Luyendyk made his second pit stop on Lap 79, and a brief issue with the air jack put him behind Stewart, but he reclaimed the lead going around the outside in Turn 1. Buhl, hampered by a failed rear wing change, and Ward also lost places to Lazier and Goodyear, although Lazier could not join the two leaders after being held up by the lapped car of Steve Kinser. At the longest green flag run of the day at 32 laps, Davey Hamilton was lapped, Eddie Cheever had to retire with a broken timing chain, and Buzz Calkins lost two laps after running out of fuel entering the pits.\nOn Lap 93, a loose brake caliper forced Eliseo Salazar, who was already 23 laps down, to stop the car in Turn 2, bringing out the yellow flag. Robbie Buhl, Vincenzo Sospiri and Jeff Ward pitted for fuel and tires, but Sospiri was shown the black flag for passing Ward under caution. Sospiri served his penalty on Lap 100, but he stopped again four laps later with an electronic coil failure, and spent much of the second half of the race in the pits trying to figure out the issue. By the halfway point, thirteen cars had dropped out, and six stayed on the lead lap, with Billy Boat, Marco Greco, Paul Durant and Davey Hamilton in the top 10.\nSecond half.\nThe race was restarted at the halfway mark, just one lap before the race became official. Buddy Lazier briefly pressured Tony Stewart, but the latter picked up the pace and caught Arie Luyendyk within five laps. Luyendyk made his pit stop on Lap 111, one lap before Stewart and Scott Goodyear, but he had issues again, this time on the left front tyre, and Stewart emerged in front of him after his stop. Buddy Lazier, Robbie Buhl and Jeff Ward, meanwhile, elected to stretch their stints, and their choice initially paid off when the 5th caution of the day came out on Lap 114.\nFrom 33rd on the grid, Paul Durant had climbed up to eighth, and was close to teammate Billy Boat, both one lap down from the leaders. In Turn 3, Boat passed Billy Roe, who was two laps down in 14th place, and Durant tried to do the same, but Roe closed the gap, unaware of Durant's presence, and both collided. Roe emerged unscathed from the heavy impact on the outside wall, but Durant had to be transferred to Methodist Hospital with a fractured pelvis and a concussion. Durant became the third injured driver in Foyt's #1 car during the month of May, after Scott Sharp and Johnny O'Connell. Durant's car kept accelerating when he got knocked out, just like Sharp two weeks before.\nWard and Lazier made their pit stop under caution, with Ward rejoining between Stewart and Luyendyk, but Lazier ran out of fuel entering the pits and lost half a minute. Surprisingly, Buhl elected not to pit despite being on the same pit sequence as the leaders and, after the '1 to go' signal prevented a late change of mind, he restarted as the race leader. Luyendyk charged again, passing Ward on the restart and Stewart on Lap 128, and inherited the race lead when Buhl pitted four laps later. Trying to navigate through traffic while losing power, Lazier had a heated argument with Marco Greco when the Brazilian held him up, waving angrily at him as he made it past.\nThe yellow flag was waved again on Lap 138, when Jack Miller, running four laps down, crashed out of 17th place after losing control of his car in Turn 3. Mike Groff, the IRL points leader, spun trying to avoid him, having already lost six laps. Luyendyk, Stewart and Goodyear pitted under caution, leaving Ward and Lazier in front. On the Lap 143 restart, Stewart struck back by passing Luyendyk and Lazier on one lap. Lazier kept dropping back, and was swiftly passed by Luyendyk and Goodyear. Despite his great restart, Stewart suffered from a push condition and lost ground to Ward, falling 7 seconds back on just five laps. Luyendyk eventually took advantage and passed him on Lap 159, with Goodyear closely behind. Six laps later, Tyce Carlson spun in Turn 2 just after being passed by Stewart. The caution ended Buhl's chances, as he had pitted just seconds before, losing a lap to the leaders.\nBoth Ward and Lazier pitted before anyone else on Lap 166 to gain track position, gambling on a caution-less finish. Luyendyk, Stewart and Goodyear pitted three laps later, but Stewart stalled his car and placed behind Goodyear on the Lap 170 restart. Both were able to pass Luyendyk, who also developed understeer in his car, and Lazier became vulnerable against all three of them on Lap 175. Twenty laps from the end, Stewart passed Goodyear but, five laps later, he went high on the exit of Turn 4 to avoid the slowing car of Buzz Calkins, which allowed Goodyear to regain the position. Luyendyk tried to follow his teammate, but Stewart closed the door on him in the backstretch, forcing Luyendyk to put two wheels on the grass. Goodyear was running 13 seconds behind Ward, but had the potential race lead, as Ward needed one final splash-and-go fuel stop before the finish.\nControversial finish.\nWith eleven laps to go, Steve Kinser crashed out of 9th place when his rear left tyre touched with the front right tyre of Buzz Calkins, whom he was lapping on the outside of Turn 4. Lyn St. James, coming from behind after being passed by Kinser, run high trying to avoid him and clipped the wall, damaging a suspension. The ensuing caution flag saw leader Jeff Ward head to the pits for a splash of fuel, as well as Tony Stewart, who was two gallons short per his team. With 8 laps left, Scott Goodyear and his teammate Arie Luyendyk led the order, followed by Buddy Lazier, while Ward and Stewart had a group of six lapped cars in front. They were the only five drivers on the lead lap.\nThe green flag came back out on Lap 194, and Luyendyk passed Goodyear on Turn 3 to take the lead. Trying to make it to the end in 5th place, Lazier lost his right-side rear-view mirror two laps later. The mirror got stranded in Turn 2, causing another caution for debris, and the green came back out at the conclusion of Lap 197, with three laps to go. As Luyendyk and Goodyear crossed the start/finish line to complete lap 198, Tony Stewart brushed the wall in turn 4, bending the right-front suspension. Although Stewart had continued, and the car was not seriously damaged, USAC immediately brought out the yellow. The pace car did not enter the track to pick up the leader, as was the normal procedure, and both teams and drivers understood the race would finish under caution, as did IMS Radio Network announcer Bob Jenkins.\nAs the cars came out of turn four, without any warning, USAC officials suddenly displayed the white and green flag at the starter's stand. The race was back underway for one final lap. The entire field hesitated as the yellow caution lights around the track remained illuminated, unsure if the green flag was an error, and if the conditions were safe to race. Luyendyk obliged the flagstand, dropped a gear, and accelerated down the front straight, getting a jump on Goodyear and the rest of the field in the process. The yellow lights continued flashing around the track, something Luyendyk noticed on his radio while entering the backstretch, and did not go off until the leaders were nearly at turn 3. The botched procedure prevented any significant challenge by Goodyear, and Arie Luyendyk pulled away just enough in the final lap to take the victory. It was Luyendyk's second Indy 500 win, becoming the 16th driver to win from the pole position. Luyendyk was emotional in victory lane as he stated:\n\"I saw the green and white flag wave and I thought 'Hell they better know what they're doing' and I will keep doing what I've been doing. This is a lot better than my first in 1990.\"\nHis teammate Scott Goodyear was satisfied but still disappointed at the outcome:\n\"That's the key lap of the whole race obviously because you want to get a draft, get the guy going and lead coming out the backstretch. I don't think Arie even expected it. Overall a 1-2 finish for Treadway is a bonus but...disappointed that I didn't win.\"\nAfter brushing the wall late, Tony Stewart limped around on the final lap with a bent suspension arm. After leading the most laps, he held on to finish in 5th place, the last car on the lead lap. It was his best Indy finish, and only career top-five at the Indy 500.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAftermath.\nAfter the 25/8 qualifying controversy, rain delays, and bungling of the final lap by the officials, as well as the scrapping of the split-calendar IRL schedule, the 1997 Indy 500 represented a relative low-point for the then-fledgling IRL. The high attrition exposed growing pains for the new chassis and engine formula. The battle of the engine suppliers was completely one-sided, as Oldsmobile dominated, taking the top 11 finishing positions. Infiniti saw no cars in contention during most of the race.\nThe race also marked the end of the IRL's lucrative initial exclusive contract with ABC Sports, which was not renewed in its entirety. While the Indy 500 itself would remain on ABC, as well as a handful of other races, the IRL would have to complete their TV scheduling with other networks for two and a half years.\nThe first move to make amends was to drop the 25/8 rule permanently. Two weeks later at Texas Motor Speedway, during the inaugural True Value 500, the increasing dissatisfaction with USAC's officiating hit the boiling point. A malfunction in the electronic scoring system scored Billy Boat as the winner of the race. Meanwhile, Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk stormed in victory lane, claiming he was robbed of the victory which led to a physical altercation between him &amp; Boat's car owner A. J. Foyt. The following day, the error was discovered, and was another black mark on USAC's record. Two weeks later, USAC was officially relieved of the duty of sanctioning the IRL, and was replaced by an in-house effort.\nOn the competition side, Luyendyk became the only driver to win an Indy 500 both before and after the open wheel \"split\". Luyendyk had previously won the 1990 Indianapolis 500, at a time when most of the field consisted of CART series regulars. Luyendyk also had the distinction of winning the race with both a turbocharged (1990) and a normally aspirated (1997) engine, as well as winning a race with Goodyear and Firestone tires.\nIn just his second Indy car race, and as a one-off driver, Jeff Ward finished in a remarkable 3rd place, winning Rookie of the Year honours. After battling with Luyendyk for most of the race, Tony Stewart could only finish the race in 5th place, behind Buddy Lazier. Indy car debutant Billy Boat and rookie Robbie Groff also finished in the top-10, with Robbie Buhl in between. Mike Groff finished as the highest Infiniti placed driver in 12th place despite losing 12 laps and retained the IRL points lead, with a 5-point advantage over Davey Hamilton, who finished sixth.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Bob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the eighth year. Johnny Rutherford served as \"driver expert\", and at the start of the race, also drove the pace car. The race was heard on roughly 500 affiliates.\nThe crew for the 1997 race remained the same from 1996. The broadcast featured rain delay coverage on Sunday, live coverage of the start on Monday, and live coverage of the conclusion on Tuesday. All members of the crew participated on all three days. After serving as a guest booth analyst the previous two years, Chris Economaki spent all three days in the pits as a roving reporter. Economaki conducted interviews and offered observations at various points during the race. In the pit area, Mark Jaynes covered the north pits, Mike King began the race in the center pits, and Vince Welch began the race in the south pits. In the second half of the race, King and Welch shared duties in the south and center pits, focusing on the race leaders.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer. Tom Sneva joined the crew, and served as booth analyst. Bobby Unser (turn 2) and Danny Sullivan (turn 4) served as turn reporters, and this would be the final 500 on ABC for both Unser and Sullivan.\nThe race was scheduled for Sunday May 25, but rain postponed the start. ABC stayed on as scheduled on Sunday, and the broadcast was filled with highlights, interviews, and talk. On Monday May 26, ABC returned to broadcast the race live, preempting regularly scheduled programming. The broadcast came on-air live at 11 EDT, and featured a one-hour pre-race, mirroring the traditional Sunday broadcast format. The race started, but was halted again on lap 15 due to rain. When it was announced that the race would be postponed again, ABC signed off and returned to their regularly scheduled lineup.\nOn Tuesday May 27, ABC returned once again to air the remainder of the race live. Unlike a similar situation in 1986, officials decided to resume the race on Tuesday, rather than wait until Saturday. ABC again preempted their afternoon lineup, and carried the entire conclusion.\nPractice and time trials were carried over three networks: ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2. "

        "title": "1996 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 80th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 26, 1996. This was the first Indy 500 contested as part of the new Indy Racing League, under the overall sanctioning umbrella of USAC. It was the third and final race of the 1996 IRL season. Veteran driver and former AIS champion Buddy Lazier won the race, his first career victory in top-level Indy car competition. Lazier's victory came just over two months after he suffered a broken back in a crash at Phoenix.\nThe race was surrounded by months of controversy. Most of the top teams and drivers in Indy car racing chose to boycott the race, protesting a perceived lockout of CART teams by the IRL. Rival teams effectively staged a \"walkout\" and instead scheduled a competing race the same day, the U.S. 500 at Michigan. The controversy and division surrounding the race became known in racing circles as \"The Split\". Participants in the 1996 Indy 500 included several familiar Indy car teams and owners such as A.J. Foyt, Dick Simon, Hemelgarn, and Menard. But top teams from CART including Penske, Ganassi, Newman/Haas, Rahal, and many others, were all at Michigan. There were also many new teams, some of which moved up from Indy Lights, AIS, or sports cars. Many of the drivers were inexperienced rookies from an obscure range of backgrounds, giving the impression of a field of replacement drivers. There was only one former Indy 500 winner in the field (Arie Luyendyk), but three former pole position winners entered. In addition, there were no former National Champions in the field for the first time since 1928.\nThe field was filled to the traditional 33 cars, but only one car was bumped (then-unknown Billy Boat). There was a post-WWII record 17 rookies that qualified, led by reigning USAC Silver Crown/Sprint/Midget champion (and future IRL and NASCAR champion) Tony Stewart. Stewart qualified for the front row, and took home rookie of the year honors. Despite comprising half the field, only two rookies managed to finish in the top ten.\nMedia attention of the open wheel \"Split\" was highly critical going into the race, as a number of the IRL participants were ridiculed and the prestige of the Indianapolis 500 itself was brought into question. The \"split\" embittered a significant portion of the fanbase, and journalist Robin Miller of \"The Indianapolis Star\" was among the most outspoken of critics. However, the race itself was found to be competitive and entertaining, while the rival U.S. 500 suffered a multi-car pile-up prior to the green flag.\nDuring practice, the month was marred by the death of pole position winner Scott Brayton, who was killed in a crash testing a back-up car. The month was also plagued by constant rain. In Indianapolis, May 1996 was the fifth-wettest month of May on record, and the 4th wettest month of May in Indy 500 history.\nThe 1996 race marked Firestone's first Indy 500 victory since 1971. In what would be the final year contested under the turbocharged engine formula (until their reintroduction in 2012), on a newly repaved track, all-time track record speeds were set during practice and time trials. Arie Luyendyk set the official one-lap track record (237.498 mph) and the four-lap track record (236.986 mph), while Eddie Cheever ran the fastest race lap (236.103 mph) in Indy 500 history - records that all still stand as of 2023. Luyendyk also ran the fastest practice lap in Indy history (239.260 mph) just a fraction of a second shy of breaking the 240 mph barrier.\nBackground.\nIRL/CART split.\nThe seeds of the IRL/CART \"Split\" were planted in the early 1990s, when newly named Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George began exploring options of changes in the sport of Indy cars. Sharply rising costs, the lack of many ovals on the schedule, and the dwindling number of American participants were among his stated concerns. As early as May 1991, George announced intentions to change the engine formula to 3.5L normally aspirated powerplants (very similar to the engines used in Formula One at the time), a plan that never got past the planning stages. George joined the CART board of directors from 1992 to 1994 as a non-voting member. He resigned after the brief tenure, disagreeing with the direction of the series.\nIn the summer of 1994, George announced he was going to start a new series, the Indy Racing League, with the Indianapolis 500 as its centerpiece. CART had been sanctioning the sport of Indy car racing since 1979, with the exception of the Indianapolis 500 itself, which was sanctioned singly by USAC. The first USAC/CART \"split\" in 1979 had already caused major controversy in the sport. USAC continued to sanction paved championship races outside of Indianapolis as late as 1981, but by 1983 dropped all races outside of Indy. An arrangement around that time was put in place to recognize the Indianapolis 500 on the CART schedule, and it would pay points towards the CART championship. The Indy 500 would be contested by the CART-based teams, along with numerous part-time and \"Indy only\" entries. Stability returned, and the sport settled into a relative harmony through 1995. Rules between the two sanctioning bodies were vastly similar, and for the most part, the same chassis and engines were used by both, with only minor technical differences.\nGeorge blueprinted the new Indy Racing League as a lower-cost alternative to CART, with an emphasis on attracting American drivers, an all-oval schedule, and new cars with normally-aspirated, \"production-based\" engines. As a result, the Indy 500 would no longer be recognized on the CART calendar, and the machines currently used in the CART series would no longer be allowed at the Speedway starting in 1997. Furthermore, due to a planned \"rules freeze\", CART's 1996 model year chassis and engines would technically be prohibited as well. \nAlmost immediately, a turbulent political controversy erupted, with participants, media, fans, manufacturers, and sponsors all apprehensive of the sport's direction and pending shakeup. The prevailing opinion around the CART paddock was largely negative regarding the formation of the IRL. The 1995 season and 1995 Indy 500 were held as normal, but under a growing cloud of uncertainty about the future of the sport. During the summer of 1995, and into the offseason, the two factions of CART and the IRL were unable to reconcile on much of anything, and the \"split\" began to take shape. The biggest salvo was made on July 3, 1995, when IRL officials announced that the top 25 drivers in IRL points would be guaranteed starting positions in the 1996 Indy 500.\nBoycott by CART teams.\nThroughout much of the summer and fall of 1995, CART teams in general were unhappy with the formation of the IRL. However, for the time being, they were still tentatively preparing to compete at Indy pending a reconciliation. In November 1995, Penske Racing (who failed to qualify at the 1995 race), and other CART teams participated in a private tire test at Indy. Meanwhile, rumors began circulating of a planned boycott, and a possible competing event.\nOn December 18, 1995 CART teams, convinced they were being deliberately locked out from the 1996 Indy 500, and the victims of a \"power grab\" by Tony George, announced their intentions to boycott the event. They jointly announced plans for a new race, the Inaugural U.S. 500, to be held at Michigan International Speedway the same day.\nThe official reaction from IMS/IRL was one of disappointment and dismay, suggesting that CART was preparing to do considerable damage to Indy car racing. CART participants were convinced of the opposite. The only CART teams that entered were Galles and Walker, but neither fielded their regular full-time CART drivers. Galles fielded an Ilmor Mercedes-Benz 265-D (the only Mercedes entered) in a one-off entry for its test driver Davy Jones. Walker entered a car in the race for Mike Groff, who had run with the team at the Nazareth a week before practice began. Out of the 33 starters from the previous edition, only 11 drivers re-entered the event, with Eliseo Salazar (4th) and Arie Luyendyk (7th) being the only top 10 finishers from 1995.\nDefending Indy 500 winner Jacques Villeneuve switched to Formula One and signed with the Williams team during the offseason, and irrespective of the \"split\", would not return to Indy for 1996. It marked the second year in a row the defending champion would not race in the 500. A year earlier, 1994 winner Al Unser Jr. failed to qualify. With the recent retirements of several Indy legends, as well as active drivers Bobby Rahal, Emerson Fittipaldi (whose career would end in July due to a crash at the Marlboro 500) and Unser Jr. who were at the CART race at Michigan, the only former Indy winner entered as a driver would be Arie Luyendyk. Additionally, the U.S. 500 field represented 109 Indy 500 starts and 5 wins, compared to just 75 previous 500 starts for the 1996 Indy 500 lineup; the lowest since 1932. The U.S. 500 competitors also accounted for 127 CART and USAC-sanctioned IndyCar wins and 7 National Championships, while the Indy 500 drivers had only 14 wins and no National Championships among the 33 starters.\n25/8 Rule and locked-in entries.\nFor the 1996 Indy 500, the \"25/8 Rule\" was adopted, where 25 starting grid positions were set aside for the top 25 cars in 1996 season IRL points standings, and the remaining 8 spots in the grid were open for the remaining entries. The arrangement was a controversial rule, and was a key issue that led the CART teams to boycott the race. The 25/8 was the form of provisional rule chosen by the IRL similar to provisional rules that was common place at the time in series which had more entries than starting position. Most series at the time had provisions in place in case a star or high up in the points system has issued in qualifying and did not run fast enough to qualify. IE: Daytona 500 qualifying which at the time locked in front row and then top 15 cars from each qualifying race. Then rest of field filled by provisional.\nThe format (similar in practice to NASCAR's Top 35 rule introduced years later) provided that the top 25 entries (not drivers) in owner points were guaranteed a \"locked-in\" starting position, and could not be bumped, provided they completed a four-lap qualifying run over a minimum prescribed speed. Officials set 220 mph as the minimum.&lt;ref name=\"Report 5/10\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The grid would still be arranged by speed rank. The pole position would still be the fastest car on the first day of qualifying (or first trip through the qualifying order), regardless of \"locked-in\" status. The remaining eight positions would be filled by non-top 25 \"at-large\" entries, and bumping could only occur amongst those participants.\nEntry list.\nThe first entry list was published on April 15. The 27 entries that had run the first two rounds of the 1996 year were entered, including the #41 A.J. Foyt Enterprises entry, vacated after Mike Groff's exit, and the #45 Zunne Group Racing entry, driven by Beck Motorsports driver Robbie Buhl at Phoenix, while Eliseo Salazar came back to his regular #7 drive at Team Scandia. Out of those 27 cars, only the #22 (Team Scandia) and the #96 (ABF Motorsports) were at-large entries. In the following weeks, Foyt signed Marco Greco to drive the #41 car, and Scandia entered Racin Gardner in the #90 car replacing Lyn St. James, who had faced budgetary issues.\nApart from Groff and Davy Jones' entries, eight further at-large driver/car combinations were registered: Fermín Vélez and a later signing, Indy 500 sophomore Alessandro Zampedri, would drive additional entries for Team Scandia. Team Menard and Hemelgarn Racing fielded third cars for Mark Dismore, returning to the Speedway five years after his horrific crash in 1991, and Brad Murphey, and Beck Motorsports prepared a second car for Hideshi Matsuda. Randy Tolsma was also signed by McCormack Motorsports, eventually falling under the Zunne Group Racing branding, Dan Drinan was entered with Loop Hole Racing and Scott Harrington entered his own car. EuroInternational, under their legal Osella USA name, and an outfit named Burns Motorsports also filled entries for Russ Wicks and Jeff Wood, but neither team appeared during the month.\nThree of the \"locked-in\" entries made no attempt to qualify. The #17 entry was eventually withdrawn, as Leigh Miller Racing had sold its assets to Beck Motorsports after Stan Wattles had been ruled out of the race on medical grounds. As for Tempero–Giuffre Racing, the #15, initially assigned to David Kudrave until being replaced by Justin Bell at the start of practice, and the #25 entry, assigned for Joe Gosek a few days earlier, were both vacated between practice days. After Brayton's forfeit of the #2 car, only 21 of the 25 eligible \"locked-in\" entries were ready to qualify, leaving twelve at-large starting positions up for grabs. On the other hand, 27 drivers took the start at the U.S. 500 at Michigan.\n Entries that were not locked-in for the race.&lt;br&gt;\n Locked-in entry repurposed as an at-large entry.\nPractice (week 1).\nSaturday May 4 - Opening Day.\nRookie orientation was scheduled for Opening Day. However, rain washed out the entire first day of practice.\nSunday May 5 - Rookie Orientation.\nOpening day was reserved for rookie orientation, largely due to the overwhelming number of Indy 500 rookies entered. A cool morning saw only half an hour of practice amongst nine cars, until rain closed the track for the day at 9:35 a.m. Rookie Tony Stewart led the abbreviated session with an unrepresentative lap of 193.957 mph.\nMonday May 6 - Rookie Orientation.\nRain hampered practice for the third day in a row, however, activity was heavy throughout the day, with many drivers looking to finish their rookie tests. At 9:19 a.m., Tony Stewart ran the fastest lap ever at the Speedway by a rookie, at 231.774 mph. Later in the day, he completed the fastest lap of the month at 237.336 mph, which broke the existing unofficial track record.\nEleven drivers completed all four phases of their rookie tests: Stewart, Mark Dismore, Buzz Calkins, Michel Jourdain Jr., Michele Alboreto, Richie Hearn, Racin Gardner, Randy Tolsma, Dan Drinan, Brad Murphey, and Jim Guthrie. Despite being considered a rookie, Davey Hamilton, who had failed to qualify for the Indy 500 in 1995, was given an exemption, and did not have to complete a rookie test. Hamilton had also entered the race in 1991 and 1993, but he never made it past the scheduled Rookie Orientation days in April, which were considered as test days and not official practice sessions.\nOff the track, Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against CART in regards to the use of the \"IndyCar\" trademark. IMS officials deemed that CART, who was organizing the rival U.S. 500, was failing to comply with the license agreement under which they received permission to use the \"IndyCar\" trademark. This lawsuit would be settled out of court months later, as CART gave up on the trademark in exchange for the Indy Racing League agreeing to not make use of it until the 2003 season.\nTuesday May 7.\nRain fell once again at the Speedway, and the start of the practice was delayed until 2:30 p.m. Veteran drivers took to the track for the first time, with Menard teammates Scott Brayton and Eddie Cheever quickly setting the pace at over 235 mph and 233 mph, respectively.\nJohnny Unser and Paul Durant both competed their rookie tests, bringing the total to 13 rookies. That morning, Zunne Group Racing announced that Lyn St. James, who had run the first two IRL races with Team Scandia, would drive its #45 entry, as a teammate to Randy Tolsma.\nLate in the day, Arie Luyendyk moved up to the top five, with a lap of 232.162 mph. Team Menard, however, swept the top three positions on the speed chart, when Tony Stewart topped at 236.121 mph.\nWednesday May 8.\nRain washed out practice for the day, the second day of the month completely lost to weather.\nThursday May 9.\nA windy but warm day saw heavy action. Arie Luyendyk ran the fastest practice lap in Speedway history up to that point in his back-up car, at 237.774 mph, four miles faster than his primary had managed, which was a surprise for Luyendyk himself. The three main Menard entries (Stewart, Cheever, and Brayton) were all over 234 mph. Several other drivers cracked the 230 mph barrier, including Buddy Lazier, Davy Jones, and Scott Sharp., while Stéphan Grégoire and Johnny Parsons made their first on-track appearances.\nFriday May 10.\n\"Fast Friday\", the final day of practice before time trials, saw the fastest laps turned in Indy history. At 1:04 p.m., 35 minutes after completing the fastest lap of the month (238.045 mph), Arie Luyendyk ran the fastest single lap in Speedway history in the back-up #35 car, with an average speed of 239.260 mph. At 37.616 seconds, Luyendyk's lap was 0.116 seconds shy of the elusive 240 mph barrier, and as of 2022, stands as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway one-lap unofficial track record. Shortly after the track opened, Scott Brayton had run his fastest lap of the month, at 235.688 mph. He was fourth fastest behind Tony Stewart, who went over the 236 mph mark, and Scott Sharp. At 3:25 p.m., rain closed the track for the day.\nDuring the day, Robbie Buhl became the 14th driver to complete his rookie test. His car had been acquired to Arizona Motorsports, and was the one Al Unser practiced on in 1994 before announcing his retirement from the sport. This machine had failed to make the grid two years in a row, as Jeff Ward was off the cut on it in 1995. With Buhl, 33 confirmed car-driver combinations had practiced before the start of Pole Day qualifying, although Joe Gosek and Justin Bell were still due to complete their rookie tests. Three drivers among the confirmed entries (Hideshi Matsuda, Johnny O'Connell and Scott Harrington) were still securing the necessary funding, and did not run at all before time trials.\nTime trials (weekend 1).\nPole Day - Saturday May 11.\nPole day dawned cold and rainy. The track opened with a 30-minute practice at 11:55 a.m., with 24 cars taking to the track. Johnny Parsons suffered the first crash of the month shortly after in Turn 3, while Arie Luyendyk, who barely avoided Parsons's crash after clipping an errant tyre, stalled with engine trouble 25 minutes later. His back-up car had now become the primary #5 entry after an approved swap of numbers. Marco Greco and Scott Sharp also lost their engines during this session. Tony Stewart ran the fastest practice lap of the morning, at 235.719 mph.\nPole day time trials began at 2 p.m. Lyn St. James was the first car to qualify, completing her four-lap run at 224.594 mph. Buddy Lazier then grabbed the provisional pole at 231.468 mph. Twenty minutes later, Davy Jones broke the 1 and 4 lap track records, completing a run at 232.882 mph. The speed broke Roberto Guerrero's 1992 track record.\nTony Stewart bumped Jones off the pole with another new track record, at 233.100 mph, becoming the first rookie to hold both the 1 and 4 lap track records since Teo Fabi in 1983. His Menard teammates Eddie Cheever (231.781 mph) and Scott Brayton (231.535 mph) also put in respectable runs, but neither were fast enough for the pole. Eliseo Salazar just missed making the front row at 232.684 mph.\nBy 5:00 p.m., the field was filled to twenty cars, fifteen of which were \"locked-in\" entries. Due to expected difficulties replacing the blown engine in his primary car, Arie Luyendyk had to revert to his original primary car, which was now the back-up, and a brand-new engine that had heating issues after a few practice laps. With 33 minutes left in the day, Luyendyk finally started his qualifying attempt. Despite averaging 232.407 mph over his first two laps, which he later blamed on the use of an incorrect gear, he got to set new all-time track records, with a best lap of 234.742 mph, and a four-lap average of 233.390 mph. With no other contenders in line, it appeared Luyendyk had secured his second Indy 500 pole. Tony Stewart and Davy Jones tentatively rounded out the front row.\nSuddenly, Team Menard began scrambling, and Scott Brayton was back on pit road carrying his helmet. The team had withdrawn their already-qualified #2 car, and Brayton was preparing to re-qualify in a back-up car, on which Brayton had only turned 13 laps that morning, although at competitive speeds. That chassis was the same one Luyendyk had used to qualify in second place at Indianapolis the previous year, and Tony Stewart had undertaken his rookie test on it. With this gamble, Menard forfeited one of their \"locked-in\" spots, but Brayton was eligible to run for the pole again. He took to the track at 5:42 p.m., and averaged 233.718 mph over a consistent 4-lap run that was fast enough to take the pole position, setting another four-lap track record. Luyendyk's one-lap record, however, still stood. At the 6 o'clock gun, Scott Brayton officially accepted his second straight Indy 500 pole position award. Luyendyk and Stewart now rounded out the front row.\nAt 7:45 p.m., USAC chief steward Keith Ward announced that Arie Luyendyk's car had failed post-qualifying inspection. The car was 7 pounds below the minimum weight of 1,550 pounds, and his qualifying attempt was disallowed. Running against time in the rush of qualifying, Byrd/Treadway Racing's crew never weighted the back-up machine after the change of engines, and both series officials and team representatives acknowledged the infraction had not been intentional, but rather an \"oversight\" by the team. The ruling elevated Tony Stewart to second place, and nullified Luyendyk's standing one-lap track record. Scott Brayton's fast lap of 233.851 mph now stood as the official one-lap record, alongside his 4-lap record. Despite being disqualified late on Saturday, Luyendyk would be permitted to re-qualify the same machine on a later day. However, one of the three allotted attempts were charged to the chassis, a similar situation to the one Michael Andretti faced in the last underweight disqualification in 1989.\nSecond Day - Sunday May 12.\nAfter being disqualified the night before, Arie Luyendyk returned to the track on the second day of time trials, now at the wheel of the primary car he could not qualify the day before. Sunday saw better weather conditions, and Luyendyk set track records on all four laps.\nLuyendyk's run made him the fastest qualifier in the field, however, as a second-day qualifier, he was forced to line up 21st (behind all of the first-day qualifiers). Luyendyk's one and four lap track records still stand as of 2023. By the end of the day, the field was filled to 26 cars, of which 18 were eligible for \"locked-in\" positions. During practice, Johnny O'Connell and Scott Harrington finally started their driver's test, the former having formalized his sponsorship on Pole Day morning, and the latter on a shoestring budget.\nPractice (week 2).\nMonday May 13.\nA light day of activity saw Tony Stewart lead the speed chart at 235.837 mph. Johnny O'Connell (216.024 mph) led the non-qualified cars and passed his rookie test, with Tyce Carlson bringing the total to 16 later that day in the Loop Hole Racing entry assigned to Dan Drinan.\nTuesday May 14.\nBrad Murphey led the non-qualified cars with a fast lap of 228.612 mph. Arie Luyendyk led all cars with a lap of 238.493 mph, faster than his official track record, and the second-fastest practice lap in Indy history.\nFermín Vélez completed his rookie test, while Billy Boat, freshly signed to drive Pagan's second car, and Andy Michner took their first practice laps of the month. Just like Tyce Carlson, Michner had not yet been assigned to a ride, and was taking his rookie test with Loop Hole Racing.\nWednesday May 15.\nRain washed out practice for the day. It marked the third entire day lost to rain, and the eighth overall hampered by the weather.\nThursday May 16.\nA fairly busy day saw 22 cars take nearly 900 laps. Arie Luyendyk once again led the speed chart, at 234.540 mph. Brad Murphey (225.875 mph) was the fastest of the non-qualified cars, with Johnny O'Connell also over 225 mph.\nRob Wilson, in a second Lola for Project Indy, took his first laps of the month. Scott Harrington and Billy Boat passed their rookie tests, but Harrington later crashed in turn 3. His team, which had few resources and was being assisted by Treadway Racing, would be unable to repair his car or buy another one in time for the second weekend of qualifying.\nJustin Bell confirmed he would not attempt to qualify for the race, as Tempero-Giuffre Racing struggled for speed all month. Bell had not passed a single phase of his rookie test and had not turned a lap since May 9, when he clocked the fastest of his 55 laps at just 186 mph. Joe Gosek, who fell short of the 200 mph barrier at the wheel of the #25, had switched rides since May 10, his best effort so far in the #15 being a 203 mph lap on May 14.\nFriday May 17 - Death of Scott Brayton.\nSix days after his Pole Day performance, Scott Brayton went back to the track to prepare for the race, running laps with the #23 back-up machine. It was a 1995 Lola chassis with a Menard engine, on which all three of his team mates had practiced previously for a total of 238 laps. At 12:17 p.m., on his 53rd lap of the day, Brayton's right-rear tyre deflated as he entered Turn 2. His car entered into a half-spin in the middle of turn, and crashed hard into the outside wall at the exit, sliding 600 feet to a stop down the backstretch. Brayton was found unconscious in the car, and was transported immediately to Methodist Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 12:50 p.m. EST. Brayton was killed instantly of basilar skull fracture.\nThe fatal incident cast a pall over the Speedway, and the entire racing community. It was determined that Brayton likely ran over a piece of debris in turn four or the mainstretch, which caused the puncture on his right rear tire. Unaware of the debris, he completed the lap at 228.606 mph, then drove into turn one. The tire suffered rapid deflation in the south chute and in turn two, causing the car to lose control. This would not be the only time death visited American Open Wheel Racing in 1996. On July 14th during the Molson Indy Toronto CART event rookie Jeff Krosnoff was killed.\nThe official report of fatality was not announced until 4 p.m, so family members could be notified. In the meantime, unaware of Brayton's condition, some other drivers resumed practice for a time. Arie Luyendyk posted the fastest lap overall at 234.870 mph, and Brad Murphey (228.548 mph) was the fastest of the non-qualified cars. When the news was released, nearly all participants stopped for the day.\nEarlier that day, veteran Danny Ongais, who had been confirmed on Thursday, took his first laps in the Brickell Racing machine, while Andy Michner, Joe Gosek and Rob Wilson became the last drivers to complete their rookie tests, bringing the total to 22. Despite this, Michner stated he had dismissed an offer to drive Foyt's back-up car, the #84, and that he would not attempt to qualify for the race, as he felt he wasn't going to get \"enough time to practice after qualifying to prepare for the race\".\nAfter completing his rookie test in the #15, Joe Gosek stepped out of his deal with Tempero-Giuffre Racing. With help from the IRL, he landed a ride as the seventh driver for Team Scandia in the #43 car, which had been driven by Fermín Vélez during the week. Vélez, who was still due to qualify, would switch to the #34, which had been the back-up car for Eliseo Salazar. Tempero-Giuffre didn't sign a replacement for Gosek, and their two locked-in entries were not qualified. With Hideshi Matsuda being left out of the qualification draw for the time being, nine at-large car-driver combinations were set to fight for five open spots, with Johnny O'Connell and Johnny Parsons still due to take their locked-in spots with a valid qualifying attempt, and the unknown status of Team Menard's now vacant spot on the grid.\nTime trials (weekend 2).\nThird Day - Saturday May 18.\nTrack activity resumed after Friday's tragedy. At 9:35 a.m., Dan Drinan, who was unsuccessfully trying to improve his best lap of the month (215 mph) during the practice session, endured a heavy accident in turn 1, in a very similar fashion to Brayton's crash. He was transported to Methodist Hospital, reportedly alert and in stable condition, and underwent surgery that same day. Drinan suffered a concussion, fractures in his left hip and foot, and a bruised left lung, and was ruled out for qualifying.\nFive drivers completed a qualification attempt, including Johnny Parsons, who had his first on-track appearance since his Pole Day crash during practice, and went on to secure his place on the grid with minimal running. Totalling just 52 laps for the whole month at the end of the day, Parsons ranked last on distance completed among all drivers that had taken part in practice. Brad Murphey was the fastest at 226.053, and the field was filled to 31 cars when Johnny O'Connell completed his attempt after the 6 p.m. gun had been fired. Danny Ongais, whose last race at the Speedway had been in 1986, completed a 20 laps refresher course, and was set to qualify on Bump Day, having logged the fastest lap among the non-qualified cars with a 220.194 mph lap. Tony Stewart shook down Brayton's car during the day, as Team Menard was reportedly looking for a driver to keep it in the field as a tribute to their fallen driver. Al Unser, Geoff Brabham and John Andretti were some of the names being floated as potential candidates.\nBump Day - Sunday May 19.\nAt 11:00 a.m., Team Menard announced that Danny Ongais would drive the #2 entry, qualified as the #32, that was vacated after the death of Scott Brayton. Due to the replacement, the car was moved to the back of the field, elevating Tony Stewart to the pole position. Ongais was recommended by Al Unser, who had been approached first by John Menard for the drive. During the day, Ongais would complete 25 laps at the wheel of the #62 back-up car, with a best lap of 221.904 mph. To replace Ongais, Brickell Racing signed Tyce Carlson, who later revealed he had to \"break\" into a friend's car to retrieve his racing suit. Carlson had attempted to reach a deal to drive for Tempero–Giuffre Racing during the week, but it had fallen through.\nAt 1:50 p.m., Randy Tolsma, who had completed his best lap of the month at 214.843 mph, crashed in Turn 1, causing considerable damage to the #24 car, although its driver was uninjured. Zunne Group Racing had not entered a spare, and Tolsma stated he was not considering offers to drive other cars for a qualification attempt. Having secured the funding on Saturday afternoon, veteran Hideshi Matsuda arrived at the track for the first time all month, and was quickly practising over 227 mph. At 4 p.m., driving an \"at-large\" entry for Beck Motorsports, Matsuda put his car safely in the field at 226.856 mph.\nDuring the day, Scott Harrington rejoined the queue, having struck a deal to drive in Della Penna's back-up, a car that Teo Fabi had driven to an 8th place finish in 1995. Billy Boat started practicing in the #84 Foyt entry, as his qualified #99 Pagan car was the slowest in the field and had no \"locked-in\" berth. At 5:24 p.m., he crashed in turn 1 and complained of back and leg pain. Boat was not medically cleared to drive, and he would not be able to re-qualify if his car was bumped.\nWith 23 minutes to go, Harrington filled the field with a run of 222.185 mph, and immediately after, Joe Gosek bumped Boat with a run of 222.793 mph, dropping Harrington to the bubble spot. Tyce Carlson made two attempts in the closing minutes, but he was not fast enough to bump his way into the field. With a best practice lap of 218.755 mph, but having failed to get over 215 mph on solo runs, Rob Wilson didn't make a qualification attempt.\nDespite the controversy regarding the \"locked-in\" entries, the \"fastest 33 cars\" did manage to make the field, and one bump did occur. None of the \"locked-in\" entries qualified slower than the slowest \"at-large\" entry, nor did any fail to meet the 220 mph requirement. At the end of qualifying, 17 rookies comprised the grid, a number that only trailed the 19 rookies that started the 1919 and 1930 editions, the latter among a 38-car field. Since then, no more than 12 rookies (1931, 1932, 1951) had qualified for the Indy 500, and the 1981 race had been the last grid with at least 10 rookie drivers. Neither of the 17 rookies had previous racing experience in a superspeedway at more than 200 mph, and 13 of them had never competed in an Indy car race prior to 1996. Also, three rookies were making their Indy car debut: Racin Gardner, Brad Murphey and Joe Gosek.\nCarburetion Day.\nThursday May 23 - Final practice.\nRain delayed the start of final practice until 12:52 p.m., and the running was hampered by multiple incidents. Stéphan Grégoire had an oil leak, Brad Murphey coasted back to the pits with low oil pressure, Paul Durant suffered a blown engine, and the car driven by Buzz Calkins developed a minor fire while in the pits. The most serious incident of the day involved Johnny Unser, who crashed in turn 4. Damage was moderate, and Unser was not injured.\nRain stopped the session at 1:49 p.m. As there had been only 23 minutes of green flag track time in between four yellows, the track reopened at 5:51 p.m. with two more yellows until the gun was fired at 6:15 p.m. During this last scramble, Danny Ongais was able to complete 17 laps in his only run at the wheel of the #32 before the race, running the 7th fastest speed with a best lap of 226.364 mph. Tony Stewart, who had inherited pole position after Brayton's death, was the fastest car of the day at 231.273 mph.\nPit Stop Contest.\nThe Coors Indy Pit Stop Challenge for 1996 featured five teams competing for a $35,000 top prize. Participation in the contest was reserved to the best five qualifiers that wished to compete, with Hemelgarn Racing being the only team among the top 5 who refused the opportunity to take part. Team Scandia initially gave up the spot too, being accepted by the #14 A. J. Foyt Racing entry before Scandia re-entered. Galles Racing and driver Davy Jones defeated Pagan Racing with driver Roberto Guerrero in the finals.\nRace summary.\nPre race.\nMorning rain threatened to delay the start, but the track was effectively dried. The cue for Mary Fendrich Hulman to give the command to start engines was given prematurely, as USAC had not finished their final inspection. As such, the engines were briefly stopped for a minute. It would be the final time Hulman would give the starting command for the \"500.\" After some hesitation, the field pulled away for the pace laps, although Hideshi Matsuda's car refused to fire because of a faulty starter was pushed to the pits, re-joining the field for the pace lap. \nDuring the first parade lap, Danny Ongais lagged behind the field, and drove one memorial parade lap alone to salute Scott Brayton's memory. On the second parade lap, Johnny Unser coasted into the pits with a transmission failure, and dropped out before the green flag.\nStart.\nA conservative and ragged start saw Tony Stewart retain the lead into Turn 1, while Eliseo Salazar overcame Davy Jones for second, and Roberto Guerrero jumped Eddie Cheever and Buddy Lazier for fourth. Most of the field started at a slow pace, but Stewart was quickly running at a record pace of 221.965 mph after two laps.\nDuring the start, Mark Dismore did a half-spin in Turn 1, and kicked up mud from the infield, which brought out the yellow on lap 3, while Dismore ducked into the pits repeatedly as his crew made checks to the car. Under the yellow, Scott Harrington approached the tail-end of the field too quickly down the backstretch, locking up the brakes as he reached them. He nearly hit three cars, and spun undamaged into the warm-up lane on Turn 3.\nAfter three green flag laps, Paul Durant blew an engine down the backstretch on Lap 11 and ducked into the warm-up lane, only to spin in his own fluid and into the racing line on Turn 1. In the Lap 18 restart, Danny Ongais lost control, and spun harmlessly through turn four. Thus, the first representative green flag period, and the longest of the race, didn't began until Lap 21. Having started 20th, Arie Luyendyk had already charged into 11th place before the first caution, and was up to 8th before the second, passing Alessandro Zampedri a few laps later as well.\nFirst half.\nTony Stewart set a rookie record by leading the first 31 laps before his first pit stop, somewhat earlier than the rest of the field, bringing up concerns over Team Menard's fuel mileage. Seven seconds behind, the pursuit was led by Roberto Guerrero, who had taken advantage of the restarts to pass Davy Jones and Eliseo Salazar. During the first pit stop window, Eddie Cheever dropped out of contention from fifth place because of a bad air wrench. Jones, meanwhile, had a slow stop that dropped him down to eighth, prompting Galles Racing to adopt a different fuel strategy.\nRunning 11 seconds behind Stewart, Eliseo Salazar went back to second place on Lap 47, and Arie Luyendyk, already in fifth position, touched the wall twice over a push condition, without damage. Another caution came out on Lap 50 after Johnny Parsons blew his engine, and Tony Stewart elected to pit again to rearrange his fuel situation, rejoining fourth, as well as Salazar. Roberto Guerrero led on the restart while Luyendyk unsuccessfully tried to pass Buddy Lazier, who benefitted from traffic. Ten laps later, Stéphan Grégoire retired with engine problems, after a well-timed first stop put him in the top 5.\nDebris on the track stirred a new caution period on Lap 70, and a large group of drivers elected to pit. Roberto Guerrero lost half a minute on his stop after a problem with the fuel nozzle and a brief stall. Arie Luyendyk also lost places to Tony Stewart, Eliseo Salazar and Alessandro Zampedri, but the Dutch passed Salazar and Zampedri on the restart. Davy Jones led the proceedings until a green flag pit stop on Lap 87.\nJust before the caution, Tony Stewart's engine developed boost pressure problems, with a suspected pop-off valve issue being feared by his engineers. Stewart, however, went after Buddy Lazier in a close pursuit when the race resumed. On Lap 81, his engine let go, pitting a lap later to retire from the race. Stewart blamed his blow-up on the unpopular pop-off valves delivered by USAC, which he described as \"junk\" and \"garbage\". Despite his early exit from the race, he would be recognized as the Rookie of the Year. Just behind him, Eddie Cheever made a pit stop, only to spin in front of Stewart's car when he left his box.\nArie Luyendyk caught up with Buddy Lazier and both drivers engaged in close pursuit until the caution came out on Lap 94, when Brad Murphey crashed in Turn 2. The leaders headed to the pits, where Luyendyk was on his way to beat Lazier, but he stalled the car. After it was refired, Luyendyk managed to rejoin the warm-up lane a few inches in front of Eliseo Salazar, who was on his right side. Suddenly, Salazar turned down on Luyendyk, and the collision sent Salazar into a wild spin through the grass and onto the track itself. Luyendyk's machine incurred damages on the nosecone, a broken suspension and broken bodywork. He lost five laps for repairs, and retired later in the race with 50 laps to go. Salazar's car also suffered heavy damage on its sidepod, but it was also repaired, and only lost a couple laps.\nWith Luyendyk, the lone former winner, out of contention, the race would have a first-time winner for the second year in a row, a first since 1990.\nSecond half.\nAt the halfway point, eleven cars had dropped out, and nine more would follow suit in the next 50 laps. The race restarted on Lap 105 with Davy Jones in the lead. Roberto Guerrero passed Buddy Lazier on the restart, but Jones quickly put 10 seconds on the Colombian. During the stint, Richie Hearn unlapped himself by passing Jones, running in sixth place at the time.\nHaving lost twelve laps, the car of Fermín Vélez had a large fire while on the backstraight, bringing out the yellow on Lap 119. During the caution, Mike Groff, one of the lead runners in fifth place, suffered a broken oil line that spilled into his cockpit, managing to reach his pit box before rushing out of the car uninjured. Davy Jones and Roberto Guerrero pitted during the caution, leaving Buddy Lazier in the lead when the race restarted. Both Jones and Guerrero rapidly closed the gap on Lazier and Alessandro Zampedri, who remained a second behind.\nA timely caution on Lap 132, brought out by Mark Dismore's broken engine, set the stage in terms of fuel mileage. Buddy Lazier, Alessandro Zampedri and Richie Hearn pitted, the Italian driver making an additional stop to top off on fuel before the restart, and they were in position to finish the race with one more pit stop. Both Davy Jones and Roberto Guerrero needed a caution before one of their two expected pit stops, or after their rivals had theirs. Guerrero had passed Jones on Lap 129, led the field at the restart, and held off an attempt at an outside pass on Turn 3. Jim Guthrie pulled into the Turn 3 warm up lane after 148 laps with fire on his car, although the race stayed green.\nOn lap 150, IRL points leader Buzz Calkins retired from the race after a right rear upright broke heading into Turn 1. After stretching their tanks as far as possible, Roberto Guerrero stopped on Lap 160, and Davy Jones followed suit a lap later. Jones' faster stop put him several seconds ahead. However, Jones and Guerrero were expected to run out of fuel in the final two laps if the race was to finish without another yellow. Moments later, Scott Harrington, running nine laps down in the 16th spot, collided with Lyn St. James, five laps down in 15th place, as he tried to pass her on the inside of Turn 1. Both drivers crashed hard into the outside wall, and St. James suffered a broken wrist. The resulting caution fixed Jones and Guerrero's fuel issues, but not their track position dilemma.\nUnder yellow, Buddy Lazier was able to make his final scheduled stop on Lap 167, with plenty of fuel to make the distance. It was a slow stop, however, as he left the pits behind Alessandro Zampedri. Guerrero also ducked into the pits to top off, but the refueler inserted the nozzle awkwardly, the fuel spilled, and the car caught fire. It remained in good enough condition to keep racing, but his two-way radio became disconnected, and it was feared Guerrero would not have enough fuel at his disposal to make it to the end. Jones stayed out, gambling on fuel, and took over the lead over Zampedri, Lazier, Guerrero and Richie Hearn, the final car on the lead lap, who also pitted.\nFor the restart, the lapped car of Eliseo Salazar was lined up just in front of Jones. As the green came out on Lap 169, Salazar blocked Jones exiting turn four. Down the frontstretch, Jones attempted to pass Salazar, but the Chilean swept to the inside, forcing Jones to brush the inside wall. It was Salazar's second controversial move of the race; Scandia's team owner Andy Evans later admitted the move was intentional, in an attempt to help Zampedri. The Italian took advantage of the situation and passed Jones on the outside of Turn 1. During his stint as the race leader, his team became increasingly worried over the car's fuel consumption, at two miles per gallon, being too high to make it to the end without stopping again.\nFinish.\nDavy Jones managed to stay within a second of Alessandro Zampedri for about 20 laps, despite being low on fuel and nursing some suspension damage from the Salazar incident, with Buddy Lazier some three seconds behind. On Lap 189, Zampedri's car developed handling issues and he understeered in Turn 3, allowing Jones to take the lead on the inside of Turn 4. A lap later, Lazier used Turn 3 to pass Zampedri on the outside, and went after Jones, who was told by the team to enter in \"full lean mode\". Lazier, running full-rich, passed Jones for the lead down the front stretch with 8 laps to go, and began to pull away, running laps over 232 mph.\nWith six laps to go, Eddie Cheever's car began smoking in Turn 2, laying down fluid on the track. Two laps later, also in Turn 2, Scott Sharp spun out of sixth place, and crashed into the inside wall, prompting a late yellow. During the caution, as he had done previously, Lazier raised his hands out of the cockpit to stretch his fingers and alleviate his increasing back pain. Track crews quickly cleaned up the incident, and the race was restarted with one lap to go, the white and green flag being displayed at the starter's stand simultaneously.\nDecisively, Lazier had managed to lap Michel Jourdain Jr. before the caution came out, and Jones, who had the chance to run full speed and catch Lazier, lagged too far behind to make an early move on Jourdain, doing so on the backstraight. That was enough of an advantage for Lazier, who held off the challenge by six tenths of a second to win his first Indy 500, which was his first Indy car race win as well. Six seconds behind, rookie Richie Hearn finished third, having passed Zampedri just before the caution. It was the first Indy car podium finish for all three drivers, accounting for six top-10 finishes between all of them before this race; Lazier and Jones had never finished higher than seventh.\nAs the leaders crossed the finish line, a serious crash occurred in Turn 4. Fifth-placed Roberto Guerrero, who had lost a lap after pitting with 10 to go, was defending his position from Eliseo Salazar, but he was not aware that he had a lap over Salazar because of his two-way radio not working. Running hard on the final lap, he spun in turn 4 and slid in front of Salazar and Alessandro Zampedri, who was between them after falling behind a group of lapped cars. Zampedri's car was pushed up, and flew up into the catch fence nose first. Salazar slid underneath Zampedri's car, and wrecked into the outside wall. Guerrero slid down the track, and came to rest in the pit area. Zampedri suffered serious injuries to his feet and nearly lost his left foot, requiring the amputation of three toes, but was able to make a remarkable comeback a year later. Due to the high attrition, and as the nearest contenders (Danny Ongais, Hideshi Matsuda and Robbie Buhl) were 3 laps down to them, all three drivers involved in the crash retained their positions.\nPost-race.\nThis victory was the first for Buddy Lazier in championship-level Indy car competition. Lazier had won races, and a championship, in the American Indycar Series, a minor league series that employed older CART machinery, but his previous best result in CART competition had been a 7th place at the Michigan 500 in 1992. In fact, he had never seen the checkered flag in his three previous Indy 500 runnings, and he had failed to qualify for the race four times. Lazier became the first American driver to score his first Indy car win at the Indy 500 since Troy Ruttman in 1952, and the first overall since Arie Luyendyk (1990). For Davy Jones (2nd), Alessandro Zampedri (4th) and Hideshi Matsuda (8th), this would be the best result of their Indy car careers.\nAt the conclusion of the race, Scott Sharp and Buzz Calkins wound up tied for first place in the points championship. The regulations did not have a tie-breaker provision at the time, so the two drivers were declared co-champions of the inaugural IRL season. Had the usual tie-breaker rules been in place, Calkins would have been declared champion because of his win at Walt Disney World Speedway. Additionally, he went on to score the most points among IRL drivers in the calendar year 1996, with races at New Hampshire and Las Vegas being held later in the year to start the 1996-97 season.\nFord scored its 8th Indy 500 win as an engine manufacturer, on which would become its final year in the race as of 2023. The company provided its engines to the IRL for the five 1996 races, but generally sided with CART during the open-wheel racing split. The company did consult with the IRL during planning stages for the 1997 normally aspirated engine formula, but ultimately elected not to build engines to those specs. Ford-Cosworth continued to focus on CART and Champ Car, being the lone engine supplier during the last years of the series, and ended its American open-wheel involvement after the 2008 unification.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Bob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the seventh year. Johnny Rutherford served as \"driver expert\". The first 500 as part of the Indy Racing League saw a few changes on the broadcasting crew.\nLarry Henry, along with Sally Larvick, left the crew, and instead joined the CART radio network for the U.S. 500 (which was anchored by Lou Palmer). Bob Forbes was also gone from the on-air team. Gary Lee shifted over to fill the vacancy in turn three, while newcomers Vince Welch and Mark Jaynes joined as pit reporters.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. ABC announced that they had signed a two-year deal to televise all the events of the newly formed Indy Racing League. The deal would include all events contested in 1996, and carry through the 1997 Indy 500. On pole day of the 1996 race, ABC signed a two-year extension with the Speedway to cover the Indy 500 itself through 1999.\nPaul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer. Sam Posey left ABC, and was no longer with the broadcast. Bobby Unser (turn 2) and Danny Sullivan (booth) served as color commentators.\nThis would be the final 500 for ABC Executive Producer Jack O'Hara, who would be killed in TWA Flight 800 less than two months later.\nThe ratings for the 1996 telecast dropped considerably from a 9.4/28 share in 1995 to a 7.1/23. This was largely attributed to the ongoing controversy regarding the IRL/CART \"split\" and the rival U.S. 500 broadcast, which overlapped slightly on ESPN.\nPractice and time trials were carried over three networks: ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2.

        "text": "The 79th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 28, 1995. Sanctioned by USAC, it was part of the 1995 CART PPG Indy Car World Series season. Jacques Villeneuve won in his second start. After dominating the 1994 race and the 1994 IndyCar season, Marlboro Team Penske failed to qualify for the race. Two-time and defending Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr. and two-time winner Emerson Fittipaldi (bumped) could not get their cars up to speed. A noticeable period of decline followed for the team until 2000 when Gil de Ferran won the CART championship, and subsequently the team returned to Indianapolis in 2001.\nOn lap 190, with the field coming back to green on a restart, leader Scott Goodyear passed the pace car in turn four, and was assessed a stop-and-go penalty. Goodyear refused to serve the penalty, claiming that the green light was on, and stayed out on the track. Per the black flag rules, officials stopped scoring Goodyear on lap 195, which handed Jacques Villeneuve the lead of the race, and ultimately, a controversial victory. Examination of video evidence after the race proved that Goodyear passed the pace car while the yellow light was on, and his team declined to protest the ruling. Villeneuve's winning car was powered by the Ford Cosworth XB engine, the powerplant's first Indy victory in its fourth attempt. The win broke a seven-year winning streak by Ilmor-constructed engines. With Goodyear's disqualification, Honda was effectively denied their first Indy victory, and did not win at Indianapolis until 2004 with Buddy Rice.\nRace winner Jacques Villeneuve's day was not without incident, as he was penalized two laps for inadvertently passing the pace car during a caution period in the early segment of the race. Through both strategy and luck, the young driver made up the deficit during the course of the race, earning the \"Indy 505\" sobriquet. In addition to the race controversies, the day was marred by a multi-car crash on the opening lap involving Stan Fox, Eddie Cheever, and others. Fox suffered career-ending head injuries.\nThe race was held under a growing cloud of uncertainty about the future of the sport of open wheel racing in the United States. Since the early 1980s, the sport had operated in relative harmony, with an arrangement such that CART sanctioned the season-long Indy car national championship, and USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 singly. The Speedway's management, led by Tony George, had already announced the formation of the rival Indy Racing League for 1996, and the Indy 500 was to be its centerpiece. Competitors, fans, and media alike, were apprehensive about the event's future beyond 1995. The 1995 race was the final Indy 500 that featured a field of CART-based drivers and teams.\nDue to injuries, retirements, and the open wheel split months later, the race was the final Indy 500 for several drivers, including Bobby Rahal, Danny Sullivan (career ending injury in Michigan in 1995), Teo Fabi, Scott Pruett, and Stefan Johansson. Emerson Fittipaldi (who failed to qualify but suffered career ending injuries in the second Michigan race in 1996) never raced at Indy again.\nThe 1995 month of May celebrated the 50th anniversary of Hulman/George family ownership of the Speedway.\nBackground.\nRule changes.\nTeam Penske dominated the 1994 race with the 209-cid Mercedes-Benz 500I purpose-built pushrod engine. Fearing an unfair advantage, and the possibility of escalating costs, both USAC and CART separately evaluated the situation. Two weeks after the 1994 race, USAC announced that for 1995, the 209 cid purpose-built pushrod engines were allowed 52 inHG of \"boost\" (down from 55 inHG). The traditional \"stock block\" production-based engines (e.g., Buick &amp; Menard) were still allowed 55 inHG. Meanwhile, the mainstay overhead cam 2.65L V-8 engines stayed at 45 inHG.\nDuring the summer of 1994, Tony George announced his plans to start the Indy Racing League in 1996, with an emphasis on cost-saving measures. On August 11, 1994, USAC changed its decision, and scaled back the boost for the purpose-built pushrod engines further to 48 inches; and outlawing it outright for 1996. The move was considered by Roger Penske as \"politically motivated\", and ultimately set back the Penske Team going into 1995.\nMarlboro Team Penske won 12 (of 16) races in 1994, including five 1-2-3 finishes, and swept the top 3 in the final 1994 CART championship points standings. As the 1995 season started, Penske drivers Al Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi each won a race prior to Indy. Despite the outward appearance that the team was still at the top of their game entering Indianapolis, insiders at the team were growing apprehensive, and were concerned that they were ill-prepared. A private test yielded poor results related to the chassis handling, and it was becoming increasingly apparent that the team had lost considerable ground after losing the use of the Mercedes-Benz 500I. A test in mid-April yielded speeds of , which would have been enough to make the race, though not put either car on the front row.\nOther changes for 1995 included the heralded return of Firestone tires, which had last competed in 1974, and an updated Honda V-8 engine.\nTeam and driver changes.\nRahal-Hogan Racing dropped the Honda program, and instead, Tasman Motorsports became the prominent team involved. Honda introduced a new engine for the 1995 race, the aluminum alloy block HRH V-8, replacing the older iron block HRX V-8. After a one-year sabbatical (spending time in broadcasting and in NASCAR), Danny Sullivan returned to Indy for PacWest Racing. Michael Andretti, after one year at Ganassi, returned to his familiar spot at Newman/Haas, alongside Paul Tracy, who moved over to that team from Penske.\nA re-booted Patrick Racing arrived at Indy with driver Scott Pruett. During the previous year, the team had served as a non-competing factory test outfit for Firestone.\nDavy Jones announced plans to attempt \"Double Duty\". He qualified at Indy, but ultimately failed to make the field at Charlotte.\nPractice – week 1.\nSaturday May 6.\nOpening day saw the Menard cars of Arie Luyendyk (233.281 mph) and Scott Brayton (232.408 mph) lead the speed chart for the day.\nSunday May 7.\nMenard cars once again were the top 2, with Luyendyk (232.715 mph) best of the day. Penske drivers Emerson Fittipaldi and defending Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr. took their first practice laps of the month, but neither were among the top ten.\nMonday May 8.\nArie Luyendyk posted the fastest practice lap in Indy history, 234.107 mph. With Scott Brayton second, Paul Tracy also was over 230 mph.\nTuesday May 9.\nScott Brayton finally bumped Luyendyk off the top spot, with a lap of 231.410 mph for the day. Teo Fabi (230.716 mph) became the fourth driver over 230 mph for the month.\nWednesday 10.\nRain delayed the start of practice until shortly after 1:30 p.m. Arie Luyendyk again led the speed charts at 232.468 mph.\nAt 3:31 p.m., Davey Hamilton crashed in turn four, suffering a broken ankle. The brief practice session was ended around 4 p.m. due to rain.\nThursday May 11.\nArie Luyendyk upped the fastest practice lap in Indy history to 234.322 mph. Scott Brayton later bettered the time with a lap of 234.656 mph. Eight drivers were over 230 mph for the day.\nFriday, May 12.\nAt 5:12 p.m., Jacques Villeneuve went high in turn 2 and crashed into the outside wall. The car was heavily damaged, but Villeneuve was not seriously injured.\nArie Luyendyk set yet another unofficial track record, with a practice lap of 234.913 mph. The top nine drivers were all over 231 mph.\nTime trials – weekend 1.\nPole day – Saturday May 13.\nRain delayed the start of time trials until late in the afternoon. At 4:45 p.m., pole day qualifying began. Arie Luyendyk in a Menard entry, took the provisional pole at 231.031 mph. A tight schedule saw several cars take runs, including Eddie Cheever (226.314 mph) and Paul Tracy (225.795 mph)\nAt 5:16 p.m., Scott Brayton, also driving for Menard, secured the pole position with a run of 231.604 mph. Before the close of the day, Michael Andretti (229.294 mph) tentatively squeezed his way onto the front row.\nWhen the 6 o'clock gun sounded, 11 cars were in the field, and several drivers were still in the qualifying line. Pole day qualifying would be extended into the next day.\nPole Day conclusion &amp; Second day – Sunday May 14.\nA windy but warm day was observed for the second day of time trials. Pole qualifying continued from the previous day. Several cars qualified, with Jacques Villeneuve leading the early cars at 228.397 mph.\nAt 1:07 p.m., Scott Goodyear (230.759 mph) qualified his Honda-powered machine for the third starting position, bumping Michael Andretti to the second row. At 1:12 p.m., the original pole day qualifying order was exhausted, and Scott Brayton was officially awarded the pole position. Among the cars who had not qualified included Rahal-Hogan drivers Bobby Rahal &amp; Raul Boesel. Neither Penske entry (Emerson Fittipaldi &amp; Al Unser Jr.) made an attempt in the pole round.\nSecond day qualifying started at just before 1:30 p.m. Among the quicker runs were Hideshi Matsuda, Bobby Rahal and Raul Boesel. Buddy Lazier joined the two previous Menard entries and put a third team car in the field. At the close of the second day of time trials, the field was filled to 25 cars (8 vacant). After continuing problems getting up to speed, neither Penske entry attempted to qualify all weekend.\nPractice – week 2.\nMonday May 15.\nTeam Menard cars took their first day off since the Speedway opened for the month. Paul Tracy (228.339 mph) led the speed chart for the day. The fastest non-qualified car was Éric Bachelart at 227.261 mph.\nAt Team Penske, Emerson Fittipaldi wheeled out a year-old Penske chassis and practiced for 59 laps, with a top lap of 220.745 mph.\nTuesday May 16.\nRain kept the track closed until 2:11 p.m. Team Penske borrowed a Reynard chassis from Roberto Guerrero's team, and Al Unser Jr. took his first laps in the car. In 44 laps, Unser posted a top lap of 218.050 mph.\nAt 4:45 p.m., Bryan Herta spun and crashed hard in turn 2. The car became slightly airborne, and Herta momentarily lost consciousness. Herta was diagnosed with a minor concussion, and was sidelined for several days.\nTeo Fabi (226.998 mph) posted the fastest lap of the day.\nWednesday May 17.\nRain closed the track for the day.\nOff the track, Rahal-Hogan Racing announced that they would supply Marlboro Team Penske with back-up Lola chassis, in a goodwill effort to help Penske's drivers get up to speed. A year earlier, Penske had loaned chassis to Rahal's team, when they were struggling to qualify the 1994 Honda-powered machines.\nThursday May 18.\nDriving the newly acquired Lola, Emerson Fittipaldi was quickly up to 223.775 mph. Al Unser Jr., however, remained in the Penske chassis, and was mired back at only 218.510 mph.\nThe practice session was brief, as rain kept the track closed until 2 p.m. Green flag conditions only lasted 53 minutes, and the track closed for rain at 3:21 p.m.\nFriday May 19.\nThe final full day of practice saw heavy action. Adrian Fernandez (228.397 mph) led the speed chart for the non-qualified cars. The attention of the afternoon was focused again on Team Penske, as they were making their final efforts to get their cars up to speed.\nEmerson Fittipaldi driving the Rahal back-up car, quickly began to find speed, and within 10 minutes, was over 226 mph. At 11:26 a.m., Fittipaldi turned a lap of 227.814 mph, his fastest lap of the month, and the fastest lap by that car all month.\nAl Unser Jr., however, was still trying to salvage speed out of the Penske car. After several inconsistent times throughout the day, his best lap of 219.085 mph was completed with five minutes left in the session. That night, Rahal offered a second chassis to Penske for Unser Jr. to drive.\nTime trials – weekend 2.\nThird Day – Saturday May 20.\nAt 5 p.m., Al Unser Jr. made his first attempt to qualify in a Rahal back-up car. Unser had practiced just minutes earlier at over 227 mph. After two laps in the 224 mph range, the run was waved off.\nScott Sharp, in a Foyt backup also waved off his first attempt. At 5:14 p.m., Emerson Fittipaldi made his first attempt in a Rahal backup car. His third lap was up to 226.097 mph, but the crew waved off the run. The move angered Fittipaldi, and proved unwise, as the speed would have been fast enough to qualify.\nMost cars failed to complete their attempts, as conditions were unfavorable for speeds. Al Unser Jr. returned to the track for his second attempt at 5:46 p.m. This run, however, slower, and even more inconsistent, and the team waved it off as well.\nFranck Fréon completed a slow run of 224.432 mph, and tentatively placed himself as slowest in the field. Scott Sharp made one last attempt as time expired, but the crew again waved off the run.\nThe day ended with the field filled to 30 cars. Both Penske cars, along with Sharp, were still not qualified.\nBump Day – Sunday May 21.\nWith only three positions remaining, bump day began with both Penske drivers struggling to get their cars up to speed. At noon, Carlos Guerrero completed a run of 225.831 mph, and filled the field to 31 cars. Davy Jones waved off a run, and the early qualifiers were through.\nOver the next four hours, the Penske team practiced, in a futile search for speed. Fittipaldi completed one lap at 228.017 mph, while Unser Jr. managed only 222.206 all afternoon.\nAt 5:07 p.m., qualifying resumed. Scott Sharp completed a run of 225.711 mph, slightly faster than his waved off run a day before. With only one position open, Emerson Fittipaldi took to the track. It was his second attempt to qualify. His four-lap run of 224.907 mph put him 32nd-fastest, and filled the field to 33 cars. Minutes later, Davy Jones completed a run of 225.135 mph, and bumped out Franck Fréon. The move put Fittipaldi on the bubble.\nAfter surviving two attempts, Fittipaldi still clung to the 33rd starting position at 5:30 p.m. His teammate Al Unser Jr. then took to the track in his third and final attempt. He faced the grim possibility of missing the field, or bumping out his teammate to make the field. Unser's first lap of 221.992 mph drastically pulled down his average, and his speed was too slow to bump out Fittipaldi.\nFittipaldi survived three more attempts, and with 12 minutes left in the day, Stefan Johansson took to the track. Johansson's speed of 225.547 mph bumped out Fittipaldi. The Penske team had three cars left in the qualifying line, but none had a realistic chance of bumping their way in, or even making it to the front of the line. As the 6 o'clock gun sounded, Fittipaldi and Unser Jr., the winners of the previous three Indy 500s, were out of time, and had failed to qualify. It was the first time since 1968 that Penske Racing had failed to qualify a single car in the Indianapolis 500. \nPost-race Roger Penske quoted, \"I've got to take the responsibility for not getting into the race, but a lot of my fellow team owners came up to me and offered me help and I want to thank them for that from the bottom of my heart. We are not going to buy our way into this race. We had an opportunity to compete on a level playing field and we did not get the job done.\"\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify.\n' = Former Indianapolis 500 Winner, ' = Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nRace recap.\nStart and Stan Fox accident.\nRain fell the night before the race, and moisture continued throughout the early morning hours. The rain stopped, however, and the track was dried. The start of the race was delayed by only about five minutes.\nAt the start, Scott Goodyear swept into the lead from the outside of the front row. Seconds later, Stan Fox dipped low to the inside, hit the rumble strips, became loose and spun a half turn. The car shot directly into the outside wall in turn one. The car was demolished, the front nose was ripped off, and Fox's legs and body were exposed as the car crashed up into the catch fence. Eddie Cheever, Lyn St. James, and Carlos Guerrero were caught up in the accident. Gil de Ferran ran over a piece of debris, breaking the front suspension. He limped back to the pits, but dropped out when it was determined the damage was too much to repair. A long caution was needed for cleanup, and Fox was critically injured with a closed head injury due to g-forces. Despite his exposed extremities, however, he suffered no major injuries to his arms or legs. Fox was transported to Methodist Hospital, and after several months, he recovered, but would never race again.\nOn lap 10, the race finally got restarted. Arie Luyendyk got the jump on the green flag, and took the lead.\nJacques Villeneuve penalty.\nOn lap 37, Arie Luyendyk was trying to get by the car of Scott Sharp. Luyendyk felt that Sharp was blocking him, and as they went into turn 1, Luyendyk gave him the finger. In the process, he knocked off his helmet headrest cushion. It flew out of the cockpit and landed on the racing surface. It brought out the yellow flag for debris. The yellow came out during a sequence of green-flag pit stops, the field was hectically shuffling in and out of the pit area.\nBy rule, the pits were immediately closed at the onset of yellow, and Jacques Villeneuve became scored as the leader on lap 38. A few cars, including Villeneuve, Scott Pruett and others, had not made their scheduled pit stop yet, and were getting precariously close to running out of fuel. Villeneuve was not aware he was actually leading the pack. The pace car came out to pick up the field, and by rule, was supposed to get directly in front of Villeneuve as the leader. But Villeneuve went by the pace car twice, not knowing they were trying to pick him up. Finally, the officials sorted out the field, the pit area was opened, and Villeneuve immediately went to the pits for service. He suffered a slow stop with several errors. He nearly pulled away with the fuel hose attached, then subsequently stalled as he pulled away.\nA few minutes after the race went back to green, USAC assessed Jacques Villeneuve a two-lap penalty for passing the pace car twice as they were trying to pick him up. The penalty dropped him from 3rd place to 27th. The two laps were effectively deleted from his scoring serial.\nRemainder of the first half.\nMichael Andretti led 45 laps in the first half but on lap 77, he was abruptly knocked out of the race. Maurício Gugelmin was leading in turn four, and Andretti was behind him in second place. Andretti caught him in turn four, as Gugelmin was slowing down to make a pit stop. Andretti tried to go around him on the outside, but got up into the \"marbles\" and brushed the wall exiting turn four, damaging the suspension. He veered across the track to enter the pits, to have the crew look over the car. The rear wishbone suspension was bent, and Andretti climbed out of the car, out of the race.\nAs Andretti was climbing from his car, Scott Sharp spun and wrecked in turn four.\nBy the time the field went back to green on lap 84, Jacques Villeneuve had made up one of his laps. He was running 20th, one lap down.\nSecond half.\nOn lap 124, Andre Ribeiro stalled on the track with an electrical problem. By that time, Jacques Villeneuve had gotten his lap back, and was now on the lead lap in 12th place. Villeneuve caught another break when Paul Tracy slowed on the backstretch with electrical problems, bringing out another caution. \nMaurício Gugelmin led the most laps (59) but did not manage to lead again after lap 138. The leaders were now Jimmy Vasser, Scott Pruett, and Scott Goodyear. Jacques Villeneuve was now up to 6th place. After Vasser pitted while leading on lap 157, Villeneuve retook the lead for the first time since his penalty. \nOn lap 162, Davy Jones crashed in turn 2 as Villeneuve was preparing to pit. The race restarted on lap 169. Vasser led following pit stops by most of the drivers during the caution. A lap later, Scott Pruett passed him going down the backstretch for the lead. Vasser got high and hit the outside wall in the north chute. Pruett held point until shortly after the restart on lap 176 when Goodyear passed him. \nBy this stage of the race, the winds began to gust over 30 mph. On lap 184, with Goodyear still in front by almost a second, Pruett got high in turn 2 and bounced off the outside wall. Pruett's car spun across the backstretch, got airborne and backed into the catchfence, demolishing the rear end.\nScott Goodyear penalty and finish.\nWith eleven laps to go, Scott Goodyear led Jacques Villeneuve, Eliseo Salazar and Christian Fittipaldi under caution. The field prepared to go back to green on lap 190. Down the backstretch, Goodyear held back a little bit and allowed the pace car to clear ahead. United States Auto Club (USAC) official Don Bailey was driving the Corvette pace car, which was entering turn four. At the entrance of turn three, Goodyear and Villeneuve both accelerated, leaving a trail of tire marks behind. Villeneuve was right on his tail. Entering turn four, Goodyear continued to accelerate, but Villeneuve suddenly backed off to avoid passing the pace car. The two cars had caught up to the pace car in the middle of turn four, and it had not yet entered the pits. Scott Goodyear did not lift, blew by the pace car and proceeded to race down the front stretch. The rest of the field checked up and a gaggle of six cars nearly collided to avoid the pace car as it pulled into the pits.\nUSAC flagman Duane Sweeney put out the green flag, with Goodyear now well ahead of the rest of the cars. Villeneuve emerged from the melee still in second, and the rest of the field diced down the front stretch and funneled into turn one without incident.\nA few moments later, USAC race control announced that Scott Goodyear was being assessed a stop-and-go penalty for passing the pace car on the restart. Goodyear was in disbelief on his radio, insisting that he did not do anything wrong. He claimed that the green light was on, and many felt the pace car was going too slow. The black flag was waved at Goodyear but he kept racing and chose not to acknowledge it. Team owner Steve Horne told Goodyear to keep going to the end believing they could protest the penalty after the race. Per the black flag rules, Goodyear had a window of five laps to serve the penalty before disqualification.\nSince he failed to heed the penalty, USAC ceased scoring Goodyear after lap 195. Therefore, when Jacques Villeneuve came around to complete lap 196, he was scored officially in the lead, with Christian Fittipaldi second and Bobby Rahal now third. Villeneuve led the rest of the way to win the race. On the last lap, Arie Luyendyk passed Villeneuve at the stripe to un-lap himself, and finished 7th on the lead lap. With his lap total stopped at 195 for ignoring the penalty, Goodyear sank through the standings to 15th place, five laps down.\nPole-sitter Scott Brayton's day ended ten laps down in 17th place. His car was down on turbocharger boost, and after the race he quipped that he was so slow he felt he \"was in the way.\" Years later, it would be revealed that Brayton (and his teammate Arie Luyendyk), were secretly being penalized by USAC for illegally over-boosting their turbocharger plenums and tampering with the pop-off valves during practice and qualifying.\nScott Goodyear was visibly upset in an interview as he said to reporters: \"Disbelief is the best word to describe how I feel. I feel like I won this race. The pace car was going too slow. ... I almost hit it. Scott Pruett almost hit it, Villeneuve almost hit it. He wasn't on the gas and I saw the green lights turn on and that meant go. That's all I can say. I stayed out because in my eyes it was perfect ... and if I came in and later found I didn't make a mistake then what are you going to do? It would have been too late and you won't get it back.\"\nAftermath and legacy.\nThe finish was highly controversial, with Scott Goodyear passing the pace car emerging as the story of the race. Goodyear claimed that he saw the green light on when he blew by the pace car, and the team threatened to protest. Video footage, however, was found that showed the yellow light was still on when it happened.\nIn addition, scoring transponders in the pace car and the race cars showed the following:\nAfter video and timing and scoring evidence came out that was not supportive of Goodyear's case, the team (Tasman Motorsports) decided not to file a protest. Goodyear stated that he stayed out (and did not serve the stop-and-go penalty) because if he was in the right, and stayed out, he could still be scored as the winner. If he came in, he would have lost the theoretical lead, and would have had no chance of claiming victory. In such case, he most likely would have finished 7th, the last car on the lead lap (except for Luyendyk, who un-lapped himself on the final lap).\nLargely overlooked was Bobby Rahal's charge from 21st starting position to 3rd – the second year in a row he greatly improved on his starting position (in 1994, he started 28th and finished 3rd). It was also the first time in an odd year that Rahal finished the race. From 1982 to 1994, Rahal had a notable \"odd-even/good-bad\" streak at Indy. In even years, he had good finishes, and in odd years, his results were poor. Rahal's result was also accomplished in spite of a pit lane speeding penalty assessed during the race, a penalty that Rahal disputed in his post race television interview, as his car's on board speedometer had said that he was traveling 91 mph, safely under the 100 mph speed limit; Rahal called the penalty 'balderdash'. This would end up being his final Indy 500 as a driver. He returned to Indy seven years later as an owner in 2002.\nArie Luyendyk's pass of Jacques Villeneuve at the start-finish line was noteworthy as it allowed him to complete the full 500 miles, becoming the second and final driver to complete 500 miles in a Buick/Menard powered car. Luyendyk's 7th-place finish was the second-highest for the Buick/Menard V6, surpassed only by the third-place finish of Al Unser, Sr. in 1992.\nJacques Villeneuve went on to win the 1995 CART championship, and subsequently signed with Williams in the offseason. With a growing cloud of controversy and uncertainty over a potential and looming open wheel \"split\", the 1995 Indianapolis 500 marked a turning point in the sport. Within months, and by the 1996 race, the landscape and organizational harmony of Indy car racing would change drastically. Villeneuve was the first, and as of 2022, is still the only Canadian to win the Indy 500.\nAl Unser Jr., who notably failed to qualify, would like others, not be able to return to the 500 for several years, due mostly to the upcoming open wheel \"split\". The devastating result helped exacerbate an existing downward spiral that was involving his personal life. Unser Jr. returned to the Speedway for the first time in August of 1998, and competed in the inaugural IROC at Indy, finishing a close second to Mark Martin. He attended a practice session for the 1999 Indy 500, and was warmly welcomed by fans. For 2000, he switched full-time to the IRL, and finally got a chance to avenge his 1995 failure.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\n1994–95 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1994–95 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1994 and running through May 1995. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nJacques Villeneuve, by virtue of winning the 1995 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1994–95 USAC Championship. This would be the final Gold Crown title awarded. USAC would sanction the newly-created Indy Racing League championship for 1996.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Bob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the sixth year. Johnny Rutherford served as \"driver expert\".\nBrian Hammons and Chris McClure departed, which shuffled the assignments slightly. Newcomer Ken Double took the turn two location, and Mike King debuted as a pit reporter. Gary Lee shifted to the pits, and Chris Economaki joined the booth to offer commentary and observations during the pre-race, near the halfway point, and in the post-race.\nThis would be the final 500 on the broadcast for Bob Forbes, Larry Henry, and Sally Larvick.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer. Bobby Unser (turn 2) and Sam Posey (booth) served as color commentators. Danny Sullivan left the broadcast and returned to the cockpit for the 1995 race.\nFor the first time since going to a live broadcast, the telecast was billed as a presentation of \"ABC's Wide World of Sports\".\nWith the exception of Sullivan, the on-air crew remained the same for the sixth straight year (from 1990 to 1995). This would be the final 500, however, for Sam Posey as he would leave ABC after the IndyCar season to join SpeedVision for their Formula One coverage. After failing to qualify for the race, Emerson Fittipaldi served as an analyst for the race coverage on Brazilian television SBT."

        "text": "The 78th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 29, 1994. The race was sanctioned by United States Auto Club (USAC), and was included as race number 4 of 16 of the 1994 PPG IndyCar World Series. For the second year in a row, weather was nary a factor during the month. Only one practice day was lost to rain, and pole day was only partially halted due to scattered showers. Warm, sunny skies greeted race day.\nAl Unser Jr. won from the pole position, his second Indy 500 victory. Much to the surprise of competitors, media, and fans, Marlboro Team Penske arrived at the Speedway with a brand new, secretly-built 209 in3 (3.42 L) displacement Ilmor Mercedes-Benz pushrod engine, which was capable of nearly . Despite reliability issues with the engine and handling difficulties with the chassis, the three-car Penske team (Unser, Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul Tracy) dominated most of the month, and practically the entire race.\nWhile Al Unser Jr. won the pole position, two-time former winner (1989, 1993) Emerson Fittipaldi dominated most of the race, leading a total of 145 laps. Fittipaldi was attempting to become the first back-to-back winner at Indy since Al Unser Sr. in 1970–1971. On lap 185, Fittipaldi was leading the race, and was looking to put Al Unser Jr. (who was running second) a lap down. Fittipaldi tagged the wall in turn 4, handing the lead to Unser with 15 laps to go. Unser was able to stretch his fuel and cruise to victory over rookie Jacques Villeneuve. Al Unser Jr. joined his father Al Sr. and uncle Bobby as winners of multiple 500s at Indianapolis.\nThe race marked the final Indy 500 for Mario Andretti (who retired at the end of the 1994 season) and Emerson Fittipaldi (who failed to qualify for the 1995 race and retired two months after the 1996 race, which was boycotted by CART). In addition, Indy veterans Al Unser Sr. and Johnny Rutherford both retired in the days leading up to the race. John Andretti, who had left CART and moved to the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, became the first driver to race in both the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day, an effort that has become known as \"Double Duty\". This was also the second and final Indy 500 for Nigel Mansell, who was knocked out of the race in a bizarre crash with Dennis Vitolo.\nAs of 2023 it was the second and final Indianapolis 500 victory for Mercedes-Benz engine to date.\nBackground.\nNigel Mansell went on to win the 1993 CART championship, with 1993 Indy 500 winner Emerson Fittipaldi finishing second in points. Mansell returned to team up again with Mario Andretti at Newman Haas. Andretti embarked on a yearlong \"Arrivederci Mario\" tour, announcing he would retire at the conclusion of the 1994 CART season. The 1994 race would be his 29th and final start at Indy. Fittipaldi remained at Penske Racing, which expanded to a three-car effort for 1994, including Al Unser Jr. and Paul Tracy. Unser parted ways with Galles after a six-year stint, and was replaced there with rookie Adrián Fernández.\nAfter a dismal season in Formula One, Michael Andretti returned to Indy car racing for 1994, signing with Ganassi. Andretti won the season opening Australian Grand Prix at Surfers Paradise. It was the first Indy car win for Ganassi, as well as the first win for the Reynard chassis (in its Indy car debut). Rahal-Hogan Racing, with drivers Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff, debuted the first Honda Indy car engine, the iron block Honda HRX Indy V-8.\nChevrolet dropped its support of the Ilmor engine program at Indy after 1993. For 1994, the 265C, the 265 C+, and 265D V-8 powerplants were badged the \"Ilmor Indy V8\".\nAfter Michael Andretti won the season opener, Marlboro Team Penske won the next two races before Indy. Emerson Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr. finished 1–2 at Phoenix, then Al Unser Jr. won at Long Beach.\nJim Nabors returned to sing the traditional \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" just months after receiving a liver transplant. Nabors had suffered a near-fatal case of Hepatitis B, which caused liver failure. Initially it was not expected that he would be able to attend the race in person.\nSix days before opening day, the worldwide motorsports community was shaken by the death of Ayrton Senna at San Marino. Indy drivers Emerson Fittipaldi, Raul Boesel, and Maurício Gugelmin, were among those in attendance at the funeral, all three serving as pall-bearers.\nMercedes-Benz 500I.\nThe most notable off-season activity involved Penske Racing and Ilmor. In the summer and fall of 1993, Penske and Ilmor engaged in a new engine project. Under complete secrecy, a purpose-built, V-8 pushrod engine was developed. Mercedes eventually came on board with the project and badged the engine the Mercedes-Benz 500I. The engine was designed to exploit a loophole that had existed in USAC's rulebook since 1991. While CART sanctioned the rest of the IndyCar season, the Indianapolis 500 itself was conducted by USAC under slightly different technical regulations. This effort represented a rare instance during this era where considerable money and effort were invested in creating a powerplant uniquely for the Indy 500 (as the 500I would be illegal in any IndyCar-sanctioned event).\nIn an effort to appeal to mainstream car companies and smaller independent engine builders (both primarily based in the US), USAC permitted traditional, \"stock-block\" pushrod engines (generally defined as non-OHC units fitted with two valves per cylinder actuated by pushrod and rocker arm). Stock blocks saw some limited use at Indy in the early 1980s and by 1985 had become mainstream with the Buick V-6. Initially, Indy stock blocks were required to have some production-based parts. However, in 1991 USAC quietly lifted this requirement allowing purpose-built pushrod engines to be designed for racing from the ground up. Attempting to create an equivalency with the DOHC, 24-valve, V-8 engines then supplied to the teams by Ford (Cosworth), Ilmor and Honda, USAC allowed Indy pushrod engines an increased displacement of instead of , and increased turbocharger boost of 55 inHG instead of 45 (1860 hPa instead of 1520).\nTeam Penske tested and further developed the engine in secret in the winter and spring of 1994. Before Mercedes-Benz joined the effort, the engine was initially called the \"265E\" which followed Ilmor's standard naming convention for their previous DOHC racing engines. This was ostensibly to maintain in-house secrecy of the pushrod project from those working within Penske and Ilmor who were not involved. The 500I was mated with the race-winning Penske chassis, the PC-23. It was introduced to the public in April, just days before opening day at Indy. Rumors quickly began to circulate that the engine, more refined than the Buick V-6 and having two more cylinders, was capable of over , which was a 150-200 hp advantage over its competition.\nTrack improvements.\nDuring the off-season, the pit area was repaved. The individual pit boxes were changed to concrete, while the entrance and exit lanes were widened and repaved in asphalt.\nA new scoring pylon was erected on the main stretch, replacing the landmark originally built in 1959.\nPractice – Week 1.\nSaturday May 7 – Opening Day.\nRain washed out opening day, the first time since 1975.\nSunday May 8.\nDick Simon Racing cars of Lyn St. James, Raul Boesel, Hiro Matsushita, Dennis Vitolo, Hideshi Matsuda and Tero Palmroth were the first cars out on the track, creating a \"Flying V\" formation.\nPaul Tracy took the first laps in the Penske PC-23/Mercedes 500I at 12:34 p.m. Al Unser Jr., however, was testing at Michigan International Speedway, reportedly \"working on reliability.\" Tracy's fastest lap was 220.103 mph.\nBobby Rahal took the first laps at Indy in the Honda, with a fast lap of 219.791 mph. Scott Brayton, in the Menard Buick posted the fastest lap of the day at 227.658 mph.\nMonday May 9.\nAt 4:45 p.m., Mike Groff's Honda engine failed, which caused the car to spin and crash into the wall in the southchute. He was not seriously injured.\nDefending Indy Lights champion Bryan Herta, who had started the month with Tasman Motorsports, was withdrawn from that entry, and signed with Foyt.\nEmerson Fittipaldi (after 'shake down' laps on Sunday) turned in his first fast laps driving the Penske PC-23/Mercedes Benz 500I, completed a lap of 226.512 mph. Al Unser Jr. took to the track for the first time in the Mercedes as well. Michael Andretti led the speed chart in the new Reynard, at 227.038 mph.\nTuesday May 10.\nRaul Boesel broke the 230 mph barrier at 5:55 p.m., the first driver to do so since 1992. His lap of 230.403 was the fastest thus far for the month. The Penske-Mercedes was close behind, turning in their best laps of the month. Paul Tracy was second-fastest for the day at 229.961 mph, and Fittipaldi was third at 229.264 mph.\nDuring the afternoon practice, an annular eclipse crossed over the state of Indiana, including the Speedway. Track temperatures cooled, and generally faster laps were observed during the phenomenon.\nWednesday May 11.\nA windy day kept speed down. Al Unser Jr. in a Penske PC-23/Mercedes Benz 500I, led the chart at 226.478 mph.\nThursday May 12.\nEmerson Fittipaldi drove his Penske PC-23/Mercedes Benz 500I to a lap of 230.438 mph, with a trap speed of 244 mph down the backstretch. Paul Tracy was second-quick at 228.444 mph (244 mph trap speed).\nFriday May 13.\nAt 3:37 p.m., Paul Tracy spun his Penske PC-23/Mercedes Benz 500I in turn 3, hit the outside wall, then crashed into the inside guardrail. He suffered a concussion, and was forced to sit out the first day of time trials.\nEmerson Fittipaldi was quickest of the day at 230.138 mph, making him a favorite for the pole position.\nTime Trials – Weekend 1.\nPole day – Saturday May 14.\nA mix of sun and rain showers stretched the qualifying line throughout the afternoon. A short shower delayed the start of qualifying until 12:15 p.m. Rookie Hideshi Matsuda became the first driver in the field, posting a 4-lap average of 222.545 mph.\nAt 12:50 p.m., Raul Boesel took the provisional pole position with a run of 227.618 mph. Later, Jacques Villeneuve qualified as the fastest rookie, with a speed of 226.259 mph.\nAt 1:18 p.m., Al Unser Jr. became the first Penske driver to take the track, attempting to qualify one of the three Penske PC-23/Mercedes Benz 500I machines. His first lap of 225.722 mph was disappointingly slow, but his speed over the last three laps climbed dramatically. His final four-lap average of 228.011 mph took over the provisional pole position.\nBobby Rahal (220.178 mph) and Mike Groff (218.808 mph) completed slow runs in their Honda-powered machines, and were the slowest two cars of the day.\nA second rain shower closed the track from about 2–5 p.m. When qualifying resumed, there was not enough time to complete the entire qualifying line. Among the runs were Lyn St. James (224.154 mph) tentatively putting her 5th fastest, and Al Unser, Sr. who waved off after a lap of 214 mph.\nThe 6 o'clock gun sounded with several drivers still in line, including Mario Andretti and Emerson Fittipaldi. Pole qualifying would be extended into the following day.\nSecond day – Sunday May 15.\nThe pole qualifying line resumed where it left off from the previous day, with Mario Andretti first out. Emerson Fittipaldi was the final car eligible for the pole position, and took his run at 1:18 p.m. His speed of 227.303 mph was not enough to bump his teammate Al Unser Jr. off the pole, but qualified him in third position. The front row was rounded out by Raul Boesel, while Lyn St. James held on to qualify for the outside of the second row, the highest starting position for a female driver to-date.\nAfter his crash Friday, Paul Tracy returned to the track Sunday. Since he sat out time trials on Saturday and missed his spot in line, he was ineligible for the pole position. He qualified as a second-day qualifier, and would line up his Penske PC-23/Mercedes Benz 500I 25th on race day. After two wave-offs on Saturday, Scott Brayton finally put his Menard-powered Lola in the field as the fastest qualifier for the second round.\nPractice – Week 2.\nMonday May 16.\nA leisurely day of practice saw only 18 cars take laps. Emerson Fittipaldi, working on race set-ups, ran the best lap at 226.421 mph. Robby Gordon spent time shaking down back-up cars for his teammates Willy T. Ribbs and Mark Smith.\nTuesday May 17.\nFour-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser, Sr. officially announced his retirement from driving at a press conference. His son, pole winner Al Unser Jr. was sick, and rested away from the track.\nOff the track, Rahal-Hogan Racing announced they had entered into a deal with Team Penske to lease two back-up cars. Driving the new Honda HRX Indy V-8s, Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff were the two slowest cars in the field, and risked being bumped. If Rahal were to not qualify, it would mark the second year in a row. Through a sponsorship connection, Roger Penske offered Rahal and Groff the use of two 1993 PC-22/Ilmor V-8 machines (2.65L). Rahal received an Ilmor D engine, while Groff received an Ilmor C+ engine. They were not the Mercedes-Benz 209I power plants, however they were competitive enough to comfortably make the field if needed. Paul Tracy shook down the cars before handing them over to the Rahal team.\nMark Smith (219.947 mph) was the fastest of the non-qualified drivers, and veteran Roberto Moreno took over Al Unser, Sr.'s car, starting a refresher test.\nWednesday May 18.\nMark Smith (220.324 mph) was again the fastest of the non-qualified drivers. Mike Groff (221.560 mph), driving the 1993 Penske/Ilmor, was already practicing faster than his qualifying speed in the Honda.\nThursday May 19.\nA busy day of practice saw 36 cars complete 1,511 laps. John Paul Jr. (222.058 mph) was the fastest non-qualified car.\nFriday May 20.\nThe final full day of practice saw 32 cars complete 1,154 laps. John Paul Jr. (221.691 mph) was yet again the fastest non-qualified car.\nTime Trials – Weekend 2.\nThird day – Saturday May 21.\nJohn Paul Jr. was the first car out for the afternoon, and safely put his car into the field. Later, Scott Goodyear completed a run at 220.737 mph. With temperatures in the 80s, the track sat dormant for most of the afternoon. That led to a ceremonial final lap for three time Indianapolis 500 champion Johnny Rutherford, driving the exact same car A. J. Foyt had driven the previous year in his ceremonial final lap.\nAt 5:37 p.m., Mark Smith (220.683 mph) filled the field to 33 cars. Davy Jones (the teammate to Scott Goodyear at King Racing) made the field in car #40T at 223.817 mph. Mike Groff and Bobby Rahal, the two slowest cars in the field, saw their Honda-powered machines bumped from the field, and re-qualified in the borrowed Penske-Ilmor cars. Both drivers improved their speeds significantly, with Rahal now the seventh-fastest car overall in the field. Both Rahal and Groff were safely in the field, and would avoid missing the race as the team had done in 1993.\nThe day ended with Scott Goodyear (220.737 mph), driving car #40 for King Racing, on the bubble. Gary Bettenhausen, after lapping in the 223 mph range, crashed during a practice run, damaging the rear end of the car. The team would be forced to make quick repairs overnight in order to be ready to attempt to qualify on Bump Day.\nBump day – Sunday May 22.\nAnother hot day (89 degrees) saw the cars stay off the track most of the afternoon. Marco Greco made the first qualifying attempt at 5:35 p.m. Greco bumped Scott Goodyear (car #40) from the field. The move put Bryan Herta (220.992 mph), driving for Foyt, on the bubble. Herta had practiced in his back-up car at over 223 mph, but the team decided not to withdraw the primary car prematurely.\nGeoff Brabham was the next driver to make an attempt. His first lap was fast enough to bump Herta, but the second and third laps dropped off, and the team waved off the run. Mark Smith returned to the track, trying to break the \"Curse of the Smiths\" at the Speedway, and bump his way back into the field. On the first lap, however, he wrecked in the first turn.\nAfter wrecking his car in practice Saturday morning, Gary Bettenhausen made a last-ditch effort to bump his way into the field. He managed only 218 mph, and waved off after two laps. Just before the 6 o'clock gun, Willy T. Ribbs made a long-shot attempt to make the field. After a lap of 216 mph, then dropping to 212 mph, he waved off and time trials came to a close.\nAfter second-guessing their strategy overnight, the Foyt team ultimately made the right decision and did not withdraw Bryan Herta from the field. The hot conditions Sunday worked in their favor, and Herta held on as the 33rd-fastest qualifier. Not since A. J. Foyt was the 32nd-fastest car in the field in 1973 had the Foyt team been so close to being bumped and missing the race entirely.\nAfter qualifying was over, King Racing swapped drivers for its primary car. Davy Jones was removed from the #40T entry, and full-time driver Scott Goodyear was placed in the car. The move required Goodyear to start from the 33rd starting position.\nStarting grid.\n Scott Goodyear and Davy Jones were teammates for King Racing. Goodyear was the full-time primary driver, and Jones (who had incidentally left Foyt before start of the month) the second team driver. At the close of qualifying, Jones had qualified 29th (the overall 9th-fastest car in the field), but Goodyear was bumped. As a gesture to the team and sponsor requests, Goodyear took Jones' place behind the wheel on race day. The driver switch required the car to be moved to the rear of the field. The move mirrored a nearly identical situation for Goodyear in the 1992 race.\nFailed to qualify.\n' = Indianapolis 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner\nRace summary.\nPre race.\nHours before the start, Al Unser Sr. took a ceremonial final lap of the track in an IndyCar, the same car he won the 1987 Indianapolis 500 with.\nGeneral Chuck Yeager lead the flyover in a P-51 Mustang.\nStart.\nClear blue skies dawned on race day, with temperatures in the mid-70s. The command to start engines was made on-time at 10:52 a.m. EST, and the field pulled away for the pace laps. Pole-sitter Al Unser Jr. led fellow front-row starters Emerson Fittipaldi and Raul Boesel.\nAs the field came around for the start, Penske teammates Unser and Fittipaldi, driving the Mercedes-powered entries, took off out of turn four. They weaved down the frontstretch single-file, blocking, and leaving behind Boesel and the rest of the field behind. USAC officials decided not to wave off the start, and Unser led into turn one. It quickly became evident to competitors and media that the Penske-Mercedes machines were the class of the field, as many had predicted.\nFirst half.\nOn lap 6, Dennis Vitolo spun in turn four, but continued causing the first caution flag of the race. Later on lap 20, Roberto Guerrero crashed in turn two. Unser went on to lead the first 23 laps. On lap 23, as the leaders pitted, Mario Andretti dropped out early of his final \"500\" with ignition problems.\nAl Unser Jr. stalled exiting the pits (a concern going into the race for the Mercedes) and Emerson Fittipaldi took the lead after the first sequence of pit stops. The yellow came back out again when Mike Groff and Dominic Dobson touched wheels and crashed in Turn 1.\nAt the restart, Michael Andretti suffered a puncture, and pitted for new tires. He stalled the car leaving the pits, and subsequently went a lap down. Eddie Cheever and Nigel Mansell were both given black flags for passing Raul Boesel prior to the restart, forcing both to make stop and go penalty passes through the pits.\nBy lap 85, Fittipaldi had stretched his lead to 24.6 seconds over second-place Unser. Jacques Villeneuve was a lap down, running as high as third.\nOn Lap 92 Hideshi Matsuda crashed in Turn 2. Under the yellow, John Paul Jr. then spun and crashed in turn 3. As the field was circulating through turn three warm-up lane behind the pace car, Dennis Vitolo was barreling down the backstretch trying to catch up with the field. He misjudged the speed of the field, and approached the line of cars too fast. He ran into the back of John Andretti's car, touched wheels with him, and spun forward in a clockwise rotation. The back of the car then rammed the back of Nigel Mansell's car, and climbed up it sideways. Al Unser Jr., among others, narrowly escaped the incident. Vitolo was found on top of Mansell, and the cars were sideways in the infield grass. Hot coolant and oil began to leak from Vitolo's car, and dripped into Mansell's cockpit. Mansell scurried out of the car and was tackled to the ground by corner workers in an effort to put out any fire. Mansell later stormed out of the infield medical care center, angrily refusing treatment. Vitolo admitted blame for the incident.\nAt the halfway point, Unser (23) and Fittipaldi (75) combined to lead 98 of the first 100 laps. The third Penske entry driven by Paul Tracy, however, began smoking during the lap 92 yellow and dropped out with turbocharger failure.\nSecond half.\nEarly contenders Raul Boesel (overheating) and Scott Brayton (spark plug) both dropped out in the second half. Fittipaldi continued to dominate, pulling away at will. On Lap 121 he set the fastest lap of the race at 40.783 seconds, equaling .\nDuring a round of pit stops by Fittipaldi and Unser, rookie Jacques Villeneuve led five laps (125-129) before pitting himself. On lap 133, Fittipaldi was forced to return to the pits to remove a plastic bag from his radiator inlet.\nA long stretch of green flag racing followed. Fittipaldi quickly caught Unser and extended his lead. By lap 157, they were the only two cars on the lead lap.\nFinish.\nWith less than 25 laps to go, Fittipaldi led Unser by almost 40 seconds. Third place Villeneuve was over a lap down. Fittipaldi was in need of one more splash-and-go pit stop for fuel before the race was over. Unser, however, was expected to make it to the finish. With 20 laps to go, Fittipaldi lapped Unser, and was a lap ahead of the entire field.\nFittipaldi's team scheduled a \"timed\" splash &amp; go fuel-only stop for lap 194. Jockeying for position, Unser unlapped himself on lap 183. Two laps later, Unser was just ahead of Fittipaldi as they approached turn 4. Fittipaldi admitted a driver error as he drove over the inside rumble strips causing the rear tires to lose grip. Fittipaldi's car slid loose, and the right rear wheel tagged the outside wall exiting turn 4. After leading 145 laps, Fittipaldi's crashed car slid to a stop down the main stretch. The crash handed Unser the lead of the race, with Jacques Villeneuve on the lead lap in second.\nArie Luyendyk blew an engine during the caution for Fittipaldi's crash. Unser was leading, but lost use of his radio, and the team was concerned about fuel mileage. The green came out with ten laps to go. Unser held a comfortable lead over Villeneuve, who was mired deep in traffic.\nOn Lap 196, Stan Fox, who was running in the top ten, crashed in turn one. The caution came out for clean-up, and erased any doubts about Unser's fuel mileage. Unser ended up winning the race under yellow. Unser won his second Indy 500, and the Penske-Mercedes 500I pushrod engine won in its first and only race. The win came on his father's 55th birthday, twenty-three years to the day after Unser Sr. won his second Indy 500. Villeneuve held on to finish second and won the rookie of the year award. Michael Andretti was penalized one lap for passing under caution, elevating Bobby Rahal to third place. Rahal had charged from the 28th starting position to third in the borrowed 1993 Penske-Ilmor machine.\nJohn Andretti finished 10th, then flew to Charlotte Motor Speedway to compete in the Coca-Cola 600. He was the first driver to do \"Double Duty\", competing in both races on the same day.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nPost race.\nAlmost immediately after the race, both USAC and CART separately evaluated the situation that stemmed from the Mercedes-Benz 500I. USAC was initially willing to allow the pushrod engines in 1995, but were concerned about the potential for escalating costs. CART, as it had previously, refused to allow the engine increased boost at the events they sanctioned, effectively rendering it uncompetitive at those races.\nTwo weeks after the race, USAC announced that for 1995, the 209 cid purpose-built pushrod engines would be allowed 52 inHG of \"boost\" (down from 55 inHG). The traditional \"stock block\" production-based engines (e.g., Buick &amp; Menard) would still be allowed 55 inHG. Meanwhile, the overhead cam 2.65L V-8 engines would stay at 45 inches. Other engine manufacturers, including Cosworth and Menard were considering 209 pushrod engines (Ilmor Engineering had already taken 30 customer orders for 500i engines for the 1995 race), and it became possible that to be competitive on the CART circuit, teams might require two separate engines for the season—a 2.65L OHC for the CART-sanctioned events, and a pushrod engine for Indianapolis singly—a daunting task which was expected to escalate costs.\nDuring the summer of 1994, Tony George announced his plans to start the Indy Racing League in 1996, with an emphasis on cost-saving measures. On August 11, 1994, USAC changed its decision, and scaled back the boost for the purpose-built pushrod engines further to 48 inches; and outlawing it outright for 1996. The move was considered by Roger Penske as \"politically motivated\", and ultimately set back the Penske Team going into 1995. Observers negatively compared the radical rules change to way USAC handled the Granatelli Turbine in the late 1960s.\nAfter the rules change, the 209-cid Mercedes-Benz 500I never raced again, but boasted a perfect 100% pole position and race winning record at Indianapolis, its only start in professional competition.\nDespite reverting to the Ilmor D powerplant for the remainder of the 1994 CART season, Marlboro Team Penske continued to dominate. The three Penske drivers won 12 (of 16) races, including five 1-2-3 finishes. Penske swept the top three in the final championship points standings, with Al Unser Jr. winning the championship, Fittipaldi second, and Tracy third.\nThe 1994 Indy 500 would prove to be the final victory for a Penske-manufactured chassis at the Speedway. The following year, the 1995-spec Penske chassis, the PC-24, proved to be noncompetitive in time trials (despite a promising test in mid-April 1995). The team failed to qualify with it or the Lola and Reynard chassis that were borrowed from other teams as alternates. By the time the team returned to the race in 2001, in-house chassis manufacturing had ended in favor of using customer chassis.\nOnly 69 days after the race, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ushered in a new era, hosting the Inaugural running of the Brickyard 400.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Bob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the fifth year. Johnny Rutherford, who retired as a driver during the month, returned to serve as \"driver expert\". Historian Donald Davidson celebrated his 30th year on the broadcast.\nThe on-air crew returned intact for 1994, which marked the fourth consecutive year the crew has remained nearly exactly the same (1991–1994). This was the last year for pit reporters Brian Hammons and Chris McClure. This was also Gary Lee's last year in Turn 2.\nThe broadcast was carried on hundreds of affiliates in all 50 states of the U.S., as well as AFN and World Harvest Radio International, reaching all continents including Antarctica. The broadcast was heard in the UK on Autosport Racing Line.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer. Newcomer and former Indy winner Danny Sullivan joined Bobby Unser and Sam Posey as color commentators. Sullivan, who tentatively retired from IndyCar racing in 1994, began dabbling in NASCAR as well as broadcasting. Sullivan took the turn four reporting location, while Bobby Unser reported from turn two. Posey remained in the booth with Page.\nWith the addition of Sullivan, the same crew from 1990 to 1993 returned. This was the first 500 broadcast to feature a \"Score bug\". A transparent digit was located on the upper right corner of the screen which counted down the number of laps remaining in the race. New on-board camera angles debuted, including a rear-wing mount on Michael Andretti's car, as well as a forward-facing camera mounted in front of the left rear wheel on Robby Gordon's car, which captured a spectacular duel with Raul Boesel. Bobby Rahal's car also featured a new nose-cam, the first such at the 500.\n1993–94 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1993–94 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1993 and running through May 1994. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nAl Unser Jr., by virtue of winning the 1994 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1993–94 USAC Championship."

        "text": "The 77th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 30, 1993. Emerson Fittipaldi took the lead with 16 laps to go, and won his second career Indy 500 victory. The race was sanctioned by USAC and was part of the 1993 PPG Indy Car World Series. Several sidebar stories during the month complemented one of the most competitive Indy 500 races in recent years.\nMuch of the pre-race attention for the month focused heavily on rookie Nigel Mansell, the reigning Formula One World Champion, who joined the CART Indy car series during the offseason. A large international media contingent arrived at the track creating a huge frenzy surrounding the Englishman. Mansell was competitive all afternoon, and was leading the race on lap 184 as the field was coming to a restart. His inexperience on oval circuits, however, led to him misjudging the restart speed and he was quickly passed down the main stretch by Fittipaldi, which proved to be the winning move.\nThe top three finishers consisted of the Brazilian Fittipaldi, Dutchman Arie Luyendyk, and the English Mansell, the first time since 1915 that all of the top three finishers were from countries other than the United States. Additionally, the fourth- and fifth-place finishers were Brazilian Raul Boesel and Italian-born American Mario Andretti.\nAfter hinting about retirement in 1991 (and later retracting retirement plans in 1992), four-time Indy 500 winner A. J. Foyt entered the 1993 race and participated in the first week of practice. On the morning of pole day qualifying, rookie Robby Gordon, driving a Foyt team car, crashed during a practice session. The incident led to Foyt deciding to retire from Indy car racing after a 35-year career.\nThe 1993 race would be the final competitive drives at Indy for both Mario Andretti and Al Unser Sr. Andretti led the most laps, and finished in fifth place. Unser also led laps during the race, en route to a 12th-place finish. Andretti would drop out of the 1994 race, and retired after the 1994 season. Unser abruptly retired during practice for the 1994 race. Also grabbing headlines during qualifying was the plight of defending CART champion and 1986 Indy winner Bobby Rahal. After struggling to get his car up to speed, Rahal was bumped from the field on the final day of time trials.\nRaul Boesel led 18 laps for owner Dick Simon, the first time a Simon-owned car ever led the Indy 500. Boesel took the lead at the start and had one of the fastest cars during the race. His chances for victory, however, were foiled due to two pit stop penalties, which dropped him to the back of the pack. He worked his way back up to a remarkable 4th-place finish, but in post race interviews, felt the race had been stolen from him, saying \"in my mind, this race is mine.\"\nBackground.\nSweeping changes were seen at Indy for 1993, both at the track and amongst the competitors. After the many crashes during the 1992 race, rule changes were implemented to slow cars down and to better protect drivers in crashes. Among the noticeable changes were smaller rear wings, and the banning of the wheel disc inserts. In addition, the front noses of the cars were changed, intended to protect the drivers' feet in a crash. Cockpits were to be redesigned to allow drivers to pull their feet back before impact.\nAlso making news at the Speedway was the official announcement of the Brickyard 400, to be held in 1994. Tony George and Bill France Jr. jointly announced the race on April 14 during a ceremony at the museum, a few weeks before opening day. The race would give the Speedway two major events annually starting in 1994.\nBeginning in 1993, a speed limit in the pit lane (100 mph) was enforced at all times. In the previous year, it was only in force during caution periods.\nDriver and team changes.\nDuring the offseason, four-time Indy 500 winner Rick Mears announced his retirement from racing. Penske driver Paul Tracy was elevated into the ride, taking over full-time, where he had previously driven part-time in 1991–1992. Tracy would earn his first career Indy car victory at Long Beach, the last race before Indianapolis.\nThe biggest story going into the season surrounded Newman/Haas Racing. Michael Andretti left the CART series and signed with McLaren to drive in Formula One. Taking Andretti's place would be reigning Formula One World Champion Nigel Mansell. Mansell came to the American open wheel series with considerable fanfare and huge media attention. Mansell joined fellow former World Driving champion Mario Andretti as teammates. Mansell won the CART season-opener at Surfers Paradise, but was involved in a crash during practice for the Valvoline 200 at Phoenix. He suffered an injured back, and sat out that event. Since he missed the Phoenix race, Indianapolis would serve as Mansell's first-ever oval race start. Mansell underwent back surgery on April 28, forcing him to miss rookie orientation, and the opening weekend of practice at Indy.\nTruesports racing was absorbed by Rahal-Hogan Racing, and driver Bobby Rahal took over the existing Truesports chassis program to start out the season. Rahal entered the race as the defending CART series champion, and was coming off a second-place finish at Long Beach.\nGalles Racing maintained its driver lineup for 1993. Defending Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr. returned, as did Danny Sullivan. The team, however, scrapped the Galmer chassis program. Kevin Cogan joined the team at Indy only, making it a three-car Indy 500 effort.\nAt Chip Ganassi Racing, Eddie Cheever departed, and was replaced by Arie Luyendyk. In 1992, Luyendyk was out of a full-time ride, and drove for Ganassi at Indy and Michigan only. For 1993, Luyendyk was back with the team, this time for a full-season ride. After his devastating crash in 1992, Nelson Piquet returned to Indy after a lengthy rehabilitation. Former winners Tom Sneva and Gordon Johncock also retired during the off-season, though Sneva did arrive at the track hoping for an outside chance to land a ride.\nAfter two years of retirement rumors, four-time winner A. J. Foyt entered once again as a driver, looking to qualify for his 36th consecutive Indy 500. Rookie driver Robby Gordon was entered in a second Foyt team car. The other active four-time winner, Al Unser Sr., secured a ride with King Racing. The previous two years, Unser had entered the month without a ride.\nTrack improvements.\nFollowing the 1992 race, an extensive construction project was undertaken at the Speedway. The \"apron\" lane at the bottom of the track was removed, and replaced with a new separated warm-up lane, similar to the one at Nazareth Speedway. A grass strip physically separated the track surface from the new warm up lane. Rumble strips were installed below the white line to discourage drivers from dipping below the white line. The improvements were made in an effort to curtail speeds, and reduce impact angles, but were criticized by some who said that it made the track too narrow and would make passing more difficult.\nThe entire outer retaining wall and catch fence was replaced, mostly in anticipation of the 1994 Brickyard 400. Other physical improvements included new grandstands at the north end of the circuit, observation mounds in the infield, and the completion of a new championship-caliber golf course on the grounds, designed by Pete Dye called Brickyard Crossing.\nPractice: week 1.\nOpening Day: Saturday May 8.\nThe traditional opening day ceremonies were capped off when Dick Simon Racing was the first team out on the track (for the 6th consecutive year). Marco Greco was the first driver to complete a lap, with the rest of the Simon cars following in a diamond formation.\nShortly before 3 p.m., Jeff Andretti entered the warm up lane in turn three too fast, and slid back onto the track into the path of Roberto Guerrero's car. Guerrero went high to avoid Andretti's spinning car, and brushed the outside wall. Neither driver was injured.\nMario Andretti (222.124 mph) was the fastest car of the day.\nSunday May 9.\nPaul Tracy was the fastest of the day. Jeff Andretti blew an engine, starting a huge fire at the back of his car, which he was able to guide back to the pits.\nMonday May 10.\nTeam Penske led the speed charts, with Paul Tracy (220.724 mph) first and Emerson Fittipaldi (220.691 mph) second. Nelson Piquet was 9th-fastest before he clipped the outside wall exiting turn 2.\nTuesday May 11.\nArie Luyendyk set the fastest lap thus far for the month at 225.89 mph. Hiro Matsushita and Paul Tracy both survived separate spins at the pit entrance without hitting anything. At about 1:30 p.m., A. J. Foyt took his first shake down laps of the month, reaching a top lap of 212 mph.\nWednesday May 12.\nRookie Nigel Mansell passed his physical and began his four-phase drivers test. He breezed through all four phases, with a top lap of 218.579 mph. Though he was unable to attend the Rookie Orientation Program, Mansell received special permission from USAC to skip the program, due to his extensive auto racing experience and expertise.\nRobbie Buhl crashed in turn two, suffering a concussion, which sidelined him until May 19. Ross Bentley and Olivier Grouillard also spun out on the track.\nRaul Boesel topped the speed chart for the day at 224.461 mph.\nThursday May 13.\nArie Luyendyk once again set the fastest lap thus far for the month, raising it to 226.182 mph. The day was without incident, except for Robby Gordon, who \"whitewalled\" the outside wall at the southchute, suffering minor suspension damage.\nMario Andretti was second fastest (225.423 mph), the second driver of the month over 225 mph. In his first full day of practice, Nigel Mansell was 6th fastest, with lap of 224.372 mph.\nFriday May 14.\nRaul Boesel (225.592 mph) topped the speed chart for the final day of practice before pole day. Nigel Mansell continued to impress, posting the second-fastest lap of the day (224.949 mph). Mario Andretti was third, but Arie Luyendyk was only 9th fastest.\nIncidents on the track involved three drivers. At 12:20 p.m., Didier Theys spun out of turn 4 and hit the inside wall, bouncing back to the middle of the frontstretch. The car was heavily damaged, but Theys suffered only a bruised thigh. At 1:53 p.m., Ross Bentley abruptly stopped on the main stretch, with the car on fire. He quickly scrambled to exit the cockpit. A fuel pressure regulator broke, spilling fuel, and igniting. Bentley suffered first and second-degree burns to his face and hands, and he would sit out the rest of the month. Late in the day, Mario Andretti spun in the warmup lane, but did not make contact.\nTime Trials: weekend 1.\nPole day – Saturday May 15.\nA.J. Foyt retires.\nPole day was warm and sunny. At 8:11 a.m., during the morning practice session, rookie Robby Gordon, driving the #41 Foyt entry, spun exiting turn 1, then brushed the wall with the nose of the car. The car continued to slide, righted itself forward, and slid along the outside wall in turn two. Gordon was uninjured. About two hours later, unexpectedly, A. J. Foyt donned his racing suit for the final time, and took to the track for a final \"farewell\" lap. After the Gordon crash, Foyt decided he was unable to fully concentrate his efforts on both driving and running the team successfully, and after previously hinting at retirement in 1991, he made his retirement official effective immediately.\nAn emotional and teary-eyed Foyt was interviewed by Tom Carnegie over the public address system, giving his farewell speech to the fans:\nOpen of qualifications.\nPromptly at 11:00 a.m., time trials began with Stan Fox the first driver in line. After three inconsistent laps, Fox waved off. Due to the challenging track layout (without the apron) and rules changes, several drivers and teams were uneasy about qualifying speeds and many waved off. Mario Andretti was the second car out, and completed his run at 223.414 mph, putting him on the provisional pole position.\nIn the first hour and fifteen minutes, only four cars completed runs. Nine cars waved off, including Arie Luyendyk, and Gary Bettenhausen wrecked on his fourth lap. At 12:30 p.m., Raul Boesel put his car on the front row with a run of 222.379 mph. Nigel Mansell waved off his first run, after three laps in the 218-219 mph range. At 1 p.m., with ten cars in the field, the track became quiet, as drivers awaited better conditions.\nAt 5 p.m., time trials resumed. Arie Luyendyk secured the pole position with a speed of 223.967 mph. Luyendyk bumped Mario Andretti to the middle of the front row, and Raul Boesel held on for the outside of the front row. Nigel Mansell was the next car out, making his second attempt. After a first lap of 221.811 mph, Mansell wildly veered to the middle of the track out of turn four (fearing that he brushed the wall exiting turn 4). His second lap dropped to 219 mph, and his four-lap average ended up 220.255 mph, good enough for 8th starting position in the middle of row 3.\nEmerson Fittipaldi, Kevin Cogan, and Stefan Johansson were the only other cars to complete runs. The day ended with 15 cars in the field, and Pruett (216.794 mph) as the slowest. Bobby Rahal was among the drivers not yet in the field.\nSecond day – Sunday May 16.\nSeveral drivers who waved off on pole day completed runs on the second day. Among those who qualified comfortably were Jeff Andretti, Lyn St. James, and Teo Fabi. After struggling all week with the Truesports chassis, Bobby Rahal completed a run at 217.140 mph. French rookie Stéphan Grégoire's last-minute run of 220.851 mph, just before the closing gun, made him the fastest rookie and quickest qualifier for the day.\nWith the field filled to 26 cars, Mark Smith (214.356 mph) was the slowest car in the field. The only incident of the day involved Davy Jones, who blew an engine on the first lap of his qualifying attempt. The hot fluids entered the cockpit, and Jones scrambled to stop the car against the inside wall near the pit entrance and climbed out.\nPractice: week 2.\nMonday – May 17.\nA light day of track activity saw John Andretti shaking down a car for Willy T. Ribbs at Walker Motorsports. Andretti hit 220.157 mph in the car, the fastest non-qualified car of the afternoon.\nTuesday – May 18.\nRain kept cars off the track until 3 p.m. An abbreviated practice session saw only 15 cars on the track, with Teo Fabi (223.381 mph) the fastest of the day; his fastest lap all month. Willy T. Ribbs took his first laps of the month, and first laps since 1991, topping out in the 210 mph range.\nWednesday – May 19.\nÉric Bachelart wrecked early in the session in turn 1, but he suffered only minor injuries. After being cleared to drive Wednesday morning, Robbie Buhl wrecked again, this time suffering an injured foot. To date, Dale Coyne Racing had now suffered four crashes in the month.\nEmerson Fittipaldi, testing race setups, set the second-fastest lap of the month, at 226.051 mph, faster than the pole position speed. Olivier Grouillard, Eddie Cheever, and Jim Crawford led the speed chart for the non-qualified drivers.\nThursday – May 20.\nThe fastest lap of the month was turned in by Mario Andretti, who blistered the track at 227.118 mph. Jim Crawford (221.212 mph) set the pace for the non-qualified drivers. The day ended 15 minutes early due to rain.\nFriday – May 21.\nThe final full day of practice saw heavy activity. A total of 33 cars ran 1,693 laps during the session, and the field passed 20,000 practice laps for the month. Nigel Mansell (225.468 mph) was the fastest-car of the day, and Robby Gordon (221.272 mph) led the non-qualified cars.\nThe only incident of the day involved Dominic Dobson, who spun to the inside of turn one, and lightly tapped the outside wall. The car was not damaged, and Dobson was not injured.\nTime Trials: weekend 2.\nThird Day – Saturday May 22.\nAt the opening of time trials, Eddie Cheever was the first car to complete a qualifying run, It was his third and final attempt in the #99 Turley Motorsports entry. His speed of 216.415 mph, was disappointingly slow compared to his previous practice laps. Jim Crawford put a third King Racing entry in the field, with a comfortable speed of 217.612 mph.\nJohn Andretti signed last-minute to drive the #84 Foyt entry, and quickly posted a speed of 221.746 mph, the fastest car of the afternoon, and 6th-fastest in the entire field. Robby Gordon, now the primary driver for Foyt, followed with a run of 220.085 mph.\nAt 5:17 p.m., Geoff Brabham easily bumped rookie Mark Smith from the field. Smith turned around and re-qualified his back-up car at 217.150 mph, bumping Eddie Cheever. The bumping continued with Willy T. Ribbs posting a solid run of 217.711 mph to bump Olivier Grouillard. Eddie Cheever took out his backup #99T car for an attempt (his fourth attempt of the month), but waved off. The day ended with Dominic Dobson bumping out Scott Pruett.\nWith questionable weather in the forecast for Sunday, the field was filled to 33 cars, with Bobby Rahal on the bubble.\nBump Day – Sunday May 23.\nWith the field already filled to 33 cars, Bump Day, the final day of time trials, started with unfavorable weather conditions. Wind gusts up to 30 mph were observed, which kept cars off the track most of the early afternoon. 1986 winner, and defending CART champion Bobby Rahal (217.140 mph) started the day on the bubble, as the slowest car in the field. His R/H chassis was proving to be uncompetitive in superspeedway trim.\nIn the morning, Team Menard offered a spare car deal for Bobby Rahal, who was in considerable danger of failing to qualify. Rahal declined, opting instead to roll out his backup car, and start getting it up to speed. After a difficult time in qualifying, Eddie Cheever quit the Turley team, and took the vacant ride at Menard.\nQualifying began at 5 p.m., with Eddie Cheever first out. Though his speed was seemingly fast enough to bump his way into the field, the crew waved off the run. Bobby Rahal remained on the bubble. Over the next half-hour, four drivers (Didier Theys, Scott Pruett, John Paul Jr., and Éric Bachelart) all attempted to bump Bobby Rahal from the field. John Paul Jr. blew his engine, and the rest were too slow and waved off. Rahal's team had to keep pulling his backup car out of line, and moving to the rear, increasing the risk that he would not be able to re-qualify if he got bumped.\nWith fifteen minutes left in the day, Eddie Cheever took to the track, overall, his record sixth qualifying attempt of the month. At 217.599 mph, he bumped Bobby Rahal from the field. The move put rookie Mark Smith (217.150 mph) on the bubble. At 5:54 p.m., Didier Theys took to the track, and completed his run at 217.752 mph. Theys bumped Smith, and added to the lore of the Curse of the Smiths at the Indy 500.\nWith just seconds remaining until the 6 o'clock gun, Bobby Rahal made it to the front of the qualifying line. At 5:59 p.m., he pulled away for his warm up laps. Kevin Cogan (217.230 mph) was now on the bubble. Rahal's first lap was completed at 217.360 mph, just fast enough to bump his way in. However, his second lap dropped to 216.820 mph. His third lap (214.782 mph) was the dagger, and Rahal failed to qualify.\nCarburetion Day – Thursday May 27.\nThe final practice session saw Scott Brayton (223.547 mph) set the fastest lap. Nigel Mansell was second, and Raul Boesel third. No incidents were reported, but a few drivers, namely Stan Fox, reported relatively minor mechanical issues.\nFirst alternate Bobby Rahal did not take the opportunity to practice. Paul Tracy was absent for the day, due to the birth of his daughter in Toronto. Emerson Fittipaldi shook down Tracy's car for a handful of practice laps.\nGalles Racing won the Miller Pit Stop Contest with driver Al Unser Jr.\nRace recap.\nPre-race.\nAfter the tumultuous off-season, and surprising events during time trials, the 500 would line up with several familiar drivers on the sidelines for one reason or another. A. J. Foyt, Rick Mears, Gordon Johncock, and Tom Sneva had retired; Bobby Rahal and Scott Pruett both failed to qualify; and Michael Andretti's commitments in Formula One prevented him from entering the race.\nAfter the miserable cold weather from the previous year, race day dawned sunny and warm. There was pre-race concern about approaching precipitation, and the forecast was questionable. Some teams prepared for a possible rain-shortened race. However, the rain never arrived, and the race was completed without interruption.\nStart.\nAt the green flag, polesitter Arie Luyendyk and Raul Boesel drag-raced down the frontstretch, with Mario Andretti dropping back into third. Boesel got the edge, and grabbed the lead into turn 1. The entire field circulated through the first lap cleanly, and started to pick up the pace. Boesel began lapping the backmarkers on lap 8, meanwhile Andretti moved past Luyendyk to take second place. On lap 16, Jim Crawford spun exiting turn 2. He flat-spotted his tires, but did not make contact. He drove back to the pits, and re-entered the race.\nUnder the caution most of the leaders pitted. Kevin Cogan stayed out, and inherited the lead. In doing so, Cogan accomplished a rare feat in which the slowest qualifier in the field led lap(s) during the race. In the pits, Raul Boesel was among those who pitted, and in the process, the crew was able to remove a hot dog wrapper that was blocking the radiator inlet. As Boesel was exiting his pit stall, he was momentarily blocked when Scott Goodyear pulled out of his stall. Further down the lane, Mario Andretti slowly pulled out of his pit box, and was ahead of Boesel. Both cars entered the warm up lane together. Boesel was going much faster and slipped by Andretti in the warm up lane. Boesel was unaware and was not informed by the officials that Mario had crossed the blend line first.\nAfter the field went back to green on lap 21, the black flag was displayed for Boesel. A controversial stop-and-go penalty was assessed to Boesel. Confusion hovered over the reason for penalty. Owner Dick Simon was initially informed it was for speeding in the pits, but then it was changed to passing under the yellow. Boesel darted into the pits to serve the penalty, and fell all the way back to the rear of the field. He lost a lap in the process.\nFirst half.\nWith Al Unser, Sr. leading on lap 31, Danny Sullivan, suffering from a pushing condition, went high in turn three and smacked the outside wall. A piece of the suspension pierced through the side of the tub, and narrowly missed puncturing his leg. Danny would not return as a driver in 1994 but did one last time in 1995. Nelson Piquet, who returned to Indy after his bad crash in 1992, dropped out with a blown engine.\nMario Andretti led the field back to green on lap 36, Arie Luyendyk ran second, and Emerson Fittipaldi third. Mario led comfortably for the next 15 laps. On lap 47, the leaders approached traffic, and Luyendyk passed Andretti to take the lead into turn one. Nigel Mansell began showing strength, passing Fittipaldi for third, then closing in his teammate Mario Andretti in second. Down the main stretch on lap 50, Mansell dove inside Mario for position, but Mario held him off, sweeping down in front in turn 1. Three laps later, Mansell finally got by Mario in turn 1, after a hot pursuit. Andretti pitted one lap later. On lap 56, Mansell passed Luyendyk coming out of turn 2 to take the lead for the first time. However, Mansell ducked into the pits on that same lap, and was not credited with leading a lap yet.\nDuring the sequence of green flag pit stops, the lead changed hands several times. After all of the leaders pitted, Nigel Mansell took over the lead.\nThe yellow came out for debris on lap 89, and after pit stops, Mario Andretti was back in the lead. Nigel Mansell overshot his pit stall, and his crew had to wheel him back to administer service. Mansell dropped to 6th place after a 40-second pit stop.\nThe green came out on lap 94, but only lasted two laps. Scott Brayton and Paul Tracy tangled entering turn three, and Tracy was forced into the outside wall. Brayton came down on Tracy, pinching him to the grass, and clipped his front wheel.\nSecond half.\nOn lap 128, the only multi-car crash of the day occurred. Jeff Andretti and Roberto Guerrero came together in turn three, with both cars crashing out. Leader Mario Andretti ducked into the pits, however, he entered the pit lane when it was closed. He was given the black flag and assessed a stop-and-go penalty. After the shuffle, Al Unser Jr. took over the lead, with Andretti second. Meanwhile, Raul Boesel was now back on the lead lap in 8th place.\nRobby Gordon brought out the yellow on lap 169 when he stalled on the track with a broken gearbox. Under the yellow, Raul Boesel entered the pits while they were closed, and was assessed a stop-and-go penalty; however, he did not lose any considerable track position.\nAfter the shuffle from the final sequence of pit stops, Nigel Mansell was now back in the lead, with Emerson Fittipaldi second, and Arie Luyendyk third.\nFinish.\nOn lap 182, the yellow came out when Lyn St. James stalled in turn 4. Nigel Mansell was leading Emerson Fittipaldi and Arie Luyendyk. On lap 184, the field was ready to go back to green. Mansell, driving in his first-ever Indy car oval race, was inexperienced in restarts, and was too hesitant bringing the field back to green. He exited turn four too slow, and immediately Fittipaldi and Luyendyk were on his rear bumper. Mansell realized he was a sitting duck, and swept to the inside of the track to attempt to block. Fittipaldi quickly diced around, and got by on the outside to take the lead. Going into turn one, Luyendyk precariously swept by Mansell on the outside and took over second place.\nWith Fittipaldi pulling away, the laps dwindled down, and Mansell's chances for victory started to slip away. On lap 192, Mansell slid high exiting turn two, and \"whitewalled\" the outside wall. A caution came out for the contact, but Mansell stayed out on the track. His suspension suffered minor damage, but he continued.\nThe green flag came out for the final time with 5 laps to go. Emerson Fittipaldi got the jump on the restart, and pulled away to a comfortable lead. Fittipaldi won his second Indy 500 by 2.8 seconds over Arie Luyendyk. Nigel Mansell held on to finish third, while Raul Boesel worked his way all the way back to the front-runners to come home fourth.\nNigel Mansell became the first rookie to finish the full 500 miles since Donnie Allison in 1970. He won the rookie of the year award, and led a total of 34 laps during the race. His late-race miscue cost him two positions, and was largely chalked up as a 'rookie mistake.' During post-race interviews, Mansell claimed he was trying to follow the rules, waiting for the green flag to come out before he accelerated, and he was surprised that Fittipaldi and Luyendyk had caught up such ground on him so quickly. He claimed that \"everybody, if you like, \"cheats\" on the restarts, and I'm trying to do it by the rules...and I lost the lead...\" However, he did not protest the results, and was pleased with his performance. Later that same year, Mansell won the Michigan 500 and went on to win the 1993 CART IndyCar championship. Mansell was honored with the Driver of the Year award, the Autosport International Racing Driver Award and an ESPY.\nPost race.\nRace winner Emerson Fittipaldi, who previously won in 1989 pulled into victory lane to celebrate his win with team owner Roger Penske. It would be the final time a driver celebrated in the \"hydraulic lift\" version of Indy's victory lane, as a new one was built for 1994. As Fittipaldi emerged from the cockpit, he immediately began the traditional winner's interview, being given by Jack Arute live on ABC-TV. Fittipaldi broke a decades-old tradition, and chose not to drink the ceremonial milk in victory lane, a tradition that dates back to 1936. Fittipaldi instead controversially drank orange juice, which he himself provided, in order to promote the Brazilian citrus industry. Arute immediately shifted his questioning to the milk snub, and the exchange on live television went as follows:\nFittipaldi refused to even hold the milk bottle, pushing it away at least three times from the presenter. After the interview was concluded, and after television cameras had been turned off, Fittipaldi finally did take a sip from the bottle of milk at the direction of his owner Roger Penske, however, not before a controversy boiled. Fan reaction to the snub was highly negative, and they charged Fittipaldi with breaking the popular and long-standing Indy tradition for personal gain. He quickly gained hecklers, and was booed the following week during driver introductions at Milwaukee. A few days after the race, Fittipaldi issued an apology statement, and donated the $5,000 prize from the American Dairy Association of Indiana to charity.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nRace statistics.\nThere were 23 lead changes involving a race record 12 different leaders. Kevin Cogan, the slowest qualifier, led 3 laps, the first time since 1923 that the slowest driver in the field led a lap at Indy.\nThe ten cars finishing on the lead lap was the most in Indy history up to that point, although it was not the most cars completing the full 500 miles (the record was 16 in 1959). However, since the implementation of the \"pack-up\" rule during caution periods in 1979, and the fact that \"extra time\" to complete the 500 miles was eliminated in the mid-1970s, ten cars completing 500 miles on the lead lap broke the CART-era record of four (1980, 1986, 1992).\nThe field completed a then race-record 5,733 out of a possible 6,600 laps (86.9%) for a full 500-mile race; a record that stood until 2013.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Bob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the fourth year. Johnny Rutherford, who missed the broadcast in 1992, returned to serve as \"driver expert.\"\nBesides Rutherford, the rest of the crew remained the same from 1991 to 1992.\nFor the first time, the radio network did not feature a separate live interview with the winner from victory lane. The network simulcast the ABC-TV live interview, which would occur immediately as the driver arrives in victory lane. This allowed the radio audience to hear the first words spoken by the winner, increasing the spontaneity, and prevented the driver from having to repeat an entire interview for a second audience.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer, joined by color commentators Bobby Unser and Sam Posey. A slight change came about for 1993. Bobby Unser left the announcing booth, and reported from the turn two position on top of the luxury suites. The move was supposedly to offer a fresh perspective, but others believed it was to separate Unser and Posey, who were known to engage in heated exchanges and debates on-air.\nBesides Unser moving his reporting position, the same exact crew, and respective duties, from 1990 to 1992 returned. Bobby Rahal, who failed to qualify for the 1993 race, was invited to be part of the crew, but declined. Two new camera angles debuted, with scaffolding towers erected inside the turns. This was done in part due to construction of new grandstands at the north end of the track and due to the outer retaining fence having been raised. Producers wanted an unobstructed view of the track, and for 1993, desirable camera locations were unavailable on the outside.\n1992–93 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1992–93 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1992 and running through May 1993. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nEmerson Fittipaldi, by virtue of winning the 1993 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1992–93 USAC Championship."

        "title": "1992 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 76th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday, May 24, 1992. The race is famous for the fierce battle in the closing laps, as race winner Al Unser Jr. held off second place Scott Goodyear for the victory by 0.043 seconds, the closest finish in Indy history. Unser Jr. became the first second-generation driver to win the Indy 500, following in the footsteps of his father Al Unser Sr. He also became the third member of the famous to win the race.\nCold temperatures and high winds turned the race into a crash-filled, marathon day. The tone for the race was set early when pole position winner Roberto Guerrero spun out and crashed on the parade lap. The race was dominated by Michael Andretti in the debut of the Ford Cosworth XB engine. Andretti led 160 laps and was 30 seconds in front when his fuel pump suddenly failed with eleven laps to go.\nThirteen cars were eliminated in crashes during the race, and several other serious wrecks occurred during practice. Former Formula One World Champion Nelson Piquet suffered serious leg injuries in a crash on May 7. Pancho Carter and Hiro Matsushita suffered broken bones in separate crashes, and rookie Jovy Marcelo was fatally injured after a practice crash on May 15. \nDefending winner Rick Mears crashed during practice and during the race, while Jeff Andretti experienced the worst crash during the race itself, suffering serious injuries to his legs and feet.\nFollowing the race, sweeping changes came about at the track, largely in the interest of safety. In addition, a noticeable \"changing of the guard\" followed, as the 1992 race signaled the final race for several Indy legends, including A. J. Foyt, Rick Mears, Tom Sneva, and Gordon Johncock. A race-record ten former winners started in the field.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1992 PPG Indy Car World Series. Unser's victory was considered by some an \"upset,\" as his somewhat inauspicious Galmer chassis was not expected to excel on ovals, and its first generation \"Chevy-A\" engine was starting to become a lame duck powerplant in the series. It was also a long-awaited victory for Unser, who was making his tenth Indy attempt. Unser, the 1990 CART champion, had recently confided with Paul Page that he was afraid he may never win the 500.\nOffseason.\nA busy offseason began at the conclusion of the 1991 PPG Indy Car World Series. The biggest announcement was the return of Ford to the Indy car ranks. The Ford Cosworth XB was introduced to replace the aging DFX and the lesser-used DFS. It quickly became an engine of choice, and for 1992, was the powerplant for Newman/Haas Racing and Chip Ganassi Racing. For 1992, Ilmor introduced an updated motor (the 265-B), badged as the \"Chevrolet-B\", and it was fielded by Penske Racing singly. The rest of the Chevrolet teams utilized the existing Ilmor (265-A), now being referred to as the \"Chevy-A\".\nGalles-Kraco Racing unveiled their new Galmer chassis for 1992. It met with instant success as Al Unser Jr. won the pole position for the season opener at Surfers Paradise and finished 4th. Teammate Danny Sullivan won a few weeks later at Long Beach, with Unser Jr. 4th. The chassis was expected to excel on street and road courses, but there were some doubts about its oval track capabilities. Unser Jr. managed a 4th place at Phoenix, but both drivers entered the month of May at Indy with mixed expectations.\nTruesports fielded their own in-house \"All American\" chassis for the second year in a row, this time designated the Truesports 92C, and powered by the Chevy Ilmor-A. Previously Truesports had been utilizing the Judd AV engine.\nAfter much fanfare of a pending retirement in 1991, A. J. Foyt brushed off the idea, and returned to the cockpit. He raced in the 1992 Daytona 500, and entered as a driver for Indianapolis. It would be his record 35th consecutive Indy 500 start. A crash earlier in the season at Phoenix left him with a fractured shoulder, but it would be only a minor setback.\nTeam and driver switches for 1992 included most notably Bobby Rahal and Danny Sullivan, who essentially swapped rides with each other at Galles-Kraco Racing and Patrick Racing, respectively. In December, however, Pat Patrick sold the assets of Patrick Racing to Rahal and his partner Carl Hogan. The team became known as Rahal-Hogan Racing. Right off the bat, Rahal scored a victory for the re-organized team. He won the second race of the season at Phoenix, leading wire-to-wire.\nRookie driver Paul Tracy continued into his second year with Penske, and was offered his first attempt at Indy with the team.\nTesting.\nDuring testing in March and April, King Racing set the early pace. On March 28, Roberto Guerrero became the first driver to run a test lap over 230 mph. Teammate Jim Crawford also ran a 230 mph lap. The Indy car testing was accompanied by a concurrent IROC feasibility test. Track management was at the time exploring the possibility of holding a stock car or IROC event at the circuit.\nGoodyear arrived at the Speedway sporting a slightly new look. The logos on the tires were painted in yellow. This coincided with a change in signage for Goodyear in American auto racing, as the company brought back their classic blue and yellow logo scheme for motorsports.\nRule changes.\nFor 1992, new pit rules were implemented by USAC. At the onset of a caution flag, the pit road was immediately closed, and cars were required to pack up behind the pace car first. The next time around, if officials deemed the field was properly bunched up, the pits would open for all competitors. In addition, a 100 mph speed limit was applied to the pits during caution periods. These rules reflected regulations that NASCAR had experimented with in 1991, and were in the interest of safety for drivers and crew members.\nPractice – week 1.\nSaturday May 2.\nKing Racing teammates Jim Crawford and Roberto Guerrero quickly established themselves as the cars to beat during the first week of practice. The two drivers fielded a pair of Lola V-6 Buicks, an engine that many thought was finally beginning to show its potential after years of development. On opening day, Crawford broke the unofficial track record with a lap of 229.609 mph. Several rookies finished their rookie tests, including Paul Tracy, Jimmy Vasser, Lyn St. James, and the most noteworthy of the rookies, former Formula One world champion Nelson Piquet.\nSunday May 3.\nFabrizio Barbazza crashed in turn 1 midway through the day during a refresher test. He was not injured. Late in the day, Al Unser Jr., driving the new Galmer chassis, blew a motor. Michael Andretti led the speed chart for the afternoon at 226.187 mph.\nMonday May 4.\nRoberto Guerrero upped the speed for the month, becoming the first driver to practice over 230 mph at the Speedway. His lap of 230.432 mph early in the session, however, lasted only a couple hours. Teammate Jim Crawford upped the speed, and by the end of the day, posted a 233.433 mph lap. Meanwhile, Nelson Piquet was comfortably getting up to speed, running a top lap of 226.809 mph.\nTuesday May 5.\nSeveral incidents occurred on Tuesday, during a cool, windy day. Scott Brayton, Buddy Lazier, and Paul Tracy each suffered separate spins/crashes. Rookie Lyn St. James was finding speed difficult, running a 217.097 mph, her fastest lap of the month, nowhere near the top of the charts. Guerrero continued King Racing's dominance, turning in another 230 mph practice lap.\nWednesday May 6.\nCrawford and Guerrero led the speed chart once again, with Crawford over 233 mph for the second time. The biggest story of the day, however, was the massive crash by Rick Mears. Late in the afternoon, Mears entered turn two, and a fluid leak sprayed water over the back wheels. The car broke out into a spin, and he crashed hard into the wall in turn two. The car flipped over and remained upside down while sliding down the backstretch. Mears suffered a minor foot fracture and an injury to his wrist.\nThursday May 7.\nThe second major crash in two days occurred, this time involving Nelson Piquet. In turn four, Piquet's car did a reverse spin, and hit the wall head-on with the nose. Piquet suffered serious injuries to both legs, and was immediately admitted to the hospital for surgery. Piquet withdrew and would require nearly a year of rehabilitation. Piquet had been acclimating himself quite well to the Speedway, but was reportedly frustrated with the frequency of caution lights during the practice sessions. A metal piece of debris was reported on the backstretch, prompting USAC to turn on the yellow. Piquet, in the middle of a \"hot lap\", momentarily ignored the yellow light, and raced through turn three and the north chute. In turn four, he lifted off the throttle quickly to enter the pits, at which time the car snapped out of control.\nRoberto Guerrero was back at the top of the speed chart, running his fastest lap of the month, 232.624 mph.\nFriday May 8.\nThe final day of practice before the run for the pole position saw four drivers over 231 mph. Mario Andretti led the chart for the day, at 233.202 mph. Arie Luyendyk was second, while Crawford and Guerrero were close behind. Al Unser, Sr. was named as a replacement for Nelson Piquet's entry, and Gary Bettenhausen suffered damage when his engine blew, causing a lazy spin in turn 1.\nTime trials – weekend 1.\nPole Day – Saturday May 9.\nRain kept the cars off the track until noon, and persistent \"weepers\" plagued the rest of the afternoon. During the first practice session, Jim Crawford's hopes for a pole position were set back when he blew an engine and spun.\nSeveral yellows for moisture and debris dragged out the 60-minute practice session until 3:15 p.m. Roberto Guerrero (232.090 mph) set the fastest practice lap of the day.\nQualifying finally began at 4 p.m. Arie Luyendyk was the first car out, and he did not disappoint. He set a new one-lap track record of 229.305 mph, and grabbed the provisional pole position with a four-lap record of 229.127 mph. A hectic round of time trials followed, as drivers scrambled for their shot at qualifying before the 6 p.m. gun. At 4:50 p.m., Gary Bettenhausen set a one-lap record of 229.317 mph, but his four-lap record was shy of the pole. Among the other drivers securing a starting position were Bobby Rahal, Emerson Fittipaldi, Paul Tracy, and Al Unser Jr. Scott Goodyear also put a Walker Racing team car in the field, taking a run of 219.054 mph.\nAt 5:34 p.m., Roberto Guerrero took to the track. He set new all-time one- and four lap track records on his way to the pole position.\nFollowing the run, Guerrero ran out of fuel, and stalled on the backstretch. The next car out to qualify was Danny Sullivan, who had already left the pits. The resulting yellow light condition halted qualifying for several minutes, and precipitated Sullivan to pull off the track and get back in line to qualify later.\nAfter Guerrero was towed back to the pits, Rick Mears took to the track, shaking off his accident earlier in the week. Mario Andretti squeezed himself onto the front row, with one lap over 230 mph. A. J. Foyt was the final car of the day. After three laps in the 226 mph range, the engine quit on the final lap, and Foyt aborted the run.\nSince the original qualifying order had not yet exhausted before the 6 p.m. close, pole qualifying was to be extended into the next day. Among the cars still in line were Jim Crawford, Michael Andretti, Eddie Cheever, and Danny Sullivan, who could not get back in line in enough time after refueling.\nSecond Day – Sunday May 10.\nWith a handful of cars still eligible for the pole, Roberto Guerrero was forced to wait through the night to see if his pole run would hold up. Teammate Jim Crawford was still considered a threat, but another engine failure in the morning practice set the team back. Eddie Cheever bumped his way into the front row with a 229.639 mph run. Michael Andretti qualified for the second row.\nCrawford's crew, scrambling to install a new motor, wheeled the car out to the pits yet unfinished, with parts in hand. Two crew members were actually sitting in the engine bay, working on it, as others pushed it towards the qualifying line. They were unable to finish the engine work in time, and Crawford missed out on his chance for the pole position. Moments later Roberto Guerrero was officially awarded the $100,000 PPG pole award.\nLate in the day, the field filled to 27 cars. Al Unser, Sr., A. J. Foyt and Raul Boesel all made runs. Crawford finally put his car in the field, but despite the 228.859 mph average (6th fastest overall), his status as a second day qualifier forced him to line up 21st.\nPractice – week 2.\nMonday May 11.\nA light day of activity saw Jeff Wood and Jovy Marcelo the fastest among non-qualified cars. Scott Pruett did a light spin, but made no contact.\nTuesday May 12.\nRain closed the track early at 2:25 p.m. Jovy Marcelo was the fastest among non-qualified cars, at 216.534 mph.\nWednesday May 13.\nIncreased activity was seen at the track. Lyn St. James was still struggling in the 212 mph range in her Cosworth. St. James' contract for Ford Motor Company had prevented her from driving the more powerful Chevrolet so far during the month.\nThursday May 14.\nTed Prappas led the non-qualified cars at 221.212 mph. Dick Simon Racing announced that an agreement had been made for Lyn St. James to utilize Philippe Gache's back up car, a Lola/Chevrolet. St. James was quickly over 218 mph.\nFriday May 15 – Fatal crash of Jovy Marcelo.\nAt 4:07 p.m., rookie Jovy Marcelo went low in turn one, and spun into the outside wall. The car slid along the wall, then came to rest in turn two. His car suffered major front end damage, and Marcelo was found unconscious. At 4:35 p.m., Marcelo was pronounced dead at Methodist Hospital of a basal skull fracture. It was the first driver fatality at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since the fatal accident of Gordon Smiley exactly ten years earlier on May 15, 1982.\nThe final full day of practice, meanwhile, saw Tony Bettenhausen Jr. run the fastest lap of the week for non-qualified cars, 221.033 mph. Didier Theys was second at 220.146 mph in a John Andretti back-up car.\nTime trials – weekend 2.\nThird Day – Saturday May 16.\nThe third day of time trials saw three cars added to the field. Tom Sneva joined as a third driver for Menard Racing, and Pancho Carter's month came to an end when he broke his arm in a turn 2 crash.\nLyn St. James ran her fastest laps of the month and became the second female driver to qualify for the Indianapolis 500. Her third lap of 220.902 mph was also a closed-course record for a female racing driver. She also became the oldest rookie driver in the history of the race, at age 45. Brian Bonner and Mike Groff (a teammate to Scott Goodyear) also completed runs, filling the field to 30 cars. Tom Sneva and Gordon Johncock were among those who waved off attempts.\nBump Day – Sunday May 17.\nThe final day of qualifying saw heavy track action. Several cars went out early on to qualify, but only Kenji Momota and Dominic Dobson finished their runs. At 2:45 p.m., in his third and final attempt, Tom Sneva put his car safely in the field at 219.737 mph. At that point, the field was filled, with Jimmy Vasser (218.268 mph) on the bubble.\nAt 3:50 p.m., Gordon Johncock bumped Vasser, which put Kenji Momota on the bubble. Vasser turned right around and re-qualified in a back-up car. Vasser's speed of 222.313 mph established him as the fastest rookie qualifier. The move put Scott Goodyear (219.054 mph) on the bubble.\nIn the final hour, after showing promise during practice, Didier Theys' third and final qualifying attempt ended with a blown engine. Likewise Tony Bettenhausen could not get up to speed and waved off. With six minutes left until the 6 o'clock gun, Ted Prappas took to the track. He bumped Scott Goodyear out by 0.089 seconds. Johnny Rutherford made one last futile attempt to qualify, but was too slow to bump his way in.\nCarburetion Day – Thursday May 21.\nThe final practice session saw Mario Andretti (226.409 mph) as the fastest car of the day. Ford Cosworth XB teams swept the top four spots. Pole-sitter Roberto Guerrero was fifth fastest, and Bobby Rahal was the fastest of the Chevrolet powered machines. Al Unser Jr. practiced a disappointing 25th speed rank. There were eight cautions during the two-hour session, but none for accidents.\nRahal-Hogan Racing with driver Bobby Rahal and chief mechanic Jim Prescott won the Miller Pit Stop contest.\nDuring the week leading up to the race, Walker Racing announced that Scott Goodyear would replace Mike Groff in the team's qualified car. Goodyear, the team's primary driver, was bumped on the final day of time trials. The switch required the #15 car to be moved to the rear of the field, and Goodyear would start 33rd on race day.\nRace recap.\nPre-race.\nA cold front entered the Indianapolis area the evening before the race, bringing misty rain and cold temperatures. Race morning dawned at , with winds gusting to . The resulting wind chill was as low as . Mary F. Hulman gave the starting command at 10:51 a.m., and the pace car, driven by Bobby Unser led the field on the way to the first parade lap. John Paul Jr.'s car experienced engine issues on the grid, but at the last second, he hastily pulled away to join the field. The cold weather made for precarious conditions for the drivers, as it would be increasingly difficult to warm up the slick tires.\nAs the field entered the backstretch on the second parade lap, polesitter Roberto Guerrero gunned his machine to warm up the tires. The back end whipped around, and the car spun into the inside wall. The suspension was damaged enough that he could not continue, and he was out of the race before the green flag. Moments later, Philippe Gache lost control on cold tires, and spun lazily into the apron of turn 4. The incidents delayed the start by about five minutes.\nWithout the polesitter in the race, second place starter Eddie Cheever was charged with leading the field to the green flag.\nFirst half.\nIn turn one, outside runners Michael and Mario Andretti split Cheever on the inside and outside. Michael took the lead, with Mario behind him in 2nd. Michael Andretti blistered the track to set a new record for the first lap at 210.339 mph. After only four laps of green flag racing, however, Éric Bachelart blew an engine. Unable to return to the pits, Bachelart brought out the yellow. During this caution period, Mario Andretti made two pit stops to have identified (and replaced) a shorted ignition wire, and dropped one lap down.\nThe field went back to green on lap 11. In turn four, Tom Sneva lost control with cold tires, and crashed hard into the outside wall. A long caution followed to clean up the debris. On lap 21, the race finally got going, with Michael Andretti the early and dominating leader.\nA fairly long stretch of green flag racing saw Michael Andretti starting to lap the field up through 12th place. Andretti was running race laps in the high 220 mph range. Andretti was being chased primarily by Arie Luyendyk, Scott Brayton and Eddie Cheever. By lap 60, Andretti held a 30-second lead, and only three cars were on the lead lap. The average speed at lap 60 had climbed to 161.458 mph\nMultiple crashes.\nMichael Andretti's blistering pace was halted on lap 62 when Gordon Johncock blew his engine. The caution bunched the field for a restart on lap 67. Moments after the green, rookie Philippe Gache spun and hit the outside wall. The car slid into the path of Stan Fox, and Fox plowed into the wreck. The crash was blamed on cold tires, and Gache's inexperience, although both drivers emerged from the crash virtually unhurt.\nThe green came back out on lap 75. In turn one, Jim Crawford lost control while attempting to pass John Andretti, and collected Rick Mears. Both cars crashed hard into the outside wall and rested on the south chute. Behind the crash, Emerson Fittipaldi lost control and hit the outside wall in turn one as well. All three drivers were sent to Methodist Hospital for relatively minor injuries. Mears would miss the next race two weeks later in Detroit as a result of this crash.\nOn lap 84, the green came out once again, but as the field headed down the mainstretch, Mario Andretti crashed in turn four. The car lost the back end due to cold tires, and slammed nose-first hard into the wall. Andretti went to Methodist Hospital with broken toes. Like Mears, Mario would also miss the next race two weeks later in Detroit due to the crash.\nThe green came back out on lap 90, but the racing was brief as Scott Brayton blew an engine on lap 94. That caution was followed by another after Paul Tracy also blew an engine on lap 97, and Jimmy Vasser subsequently smacked the wall in turn one. The field went back to green on lap 103, but cold tires struck again, as rookie Brian Bonner lost control and crashed in turn 4.\nThe field safely restarted on lap 110. Five laps later, a major crash occurred. Jeff Andretti's car broke a right-rear wheel hub in turn two. The car snapped into a hard spin, and Jeff Andretti crashed head-on into the wall near the Turn Two Suites. The front of the car was demolished, and Andretti suffered severe leg injuries. Andretti's errant right-rear tire and wheel bounced off the outside retaining wall and flew high into the air and across the track. The wheel struck Gary Bettenhausen's left front suspension, sending him out of control into the inside wall at the start of the backstretch, eliminating him from the race as well. It took 18 minutes to extricate Jeff Andretti from the car, and he was immediately transported to Methodist Hospital for surgery. Meanwhile, Jeff's older brother Michael Andretti was still leading. Michael, however, had just seen both his father and brother crash and be sent to the hospital.\nJust seconds before Jeff Andretti's crash, Bobby Rahal was forced to pit due to a flat tire. When the yellow came out for Andretti, Rahal lost a lap, and would be mired a lap down the rest of the way.\nFrom lap 62–122, only nine laps of green flag racing were turned in. Eight cautions slowed the race for almost 90 minutes. The race finally got back underway at lap 123.\nSecond half.\nMichael Andretti took over where he had left off, and pulled away from the competition. The dwindling field was down to 17 cars, and only six were on the lead lap. Among the cars still in contention were Ganassi teammates Eddie Cheever and Arie Luyendyk. Al Unser Jr. and Al Unser Sr. had moved up into the top five, and Scott Goodyear had climbed from last starting position to 6th place (last car on the lead lap). A. J. Foyt had worked his way into the top ten, and by lap 135, Lyn St. James was the only rookie left running.\nAround the halfway point of the race, the National Weather Service had issued a bulletin. The temperature was , cloudy skies, with winds at 15 mph, resulting in a wind chill of .\nOn lap 137, Arie Luyendyk attempted to lap A. J. Foyt, but Foyt had lost a mirror and did not see him. Luyendyk got into the \"marbles,\" and slid up into the turn 4 wall. \nThe green resumed on lap 144, with Al Unser Jr. in the lead after a sequence of pit stops. Michael Andretti charged towards the front, but Al Unser Sr. passed him for second momentarily. The dicing was halted when Buddy Lazier blew an engine and brought another yellow out.\nWith 50 laps to go, only 15 cars were running, and only five cars were on the lead lap.\nLate race.\nWith 45 laps to go, the green came out and the field began the race to the finish. Michael Andretti once again began to easily pull away from his competitors. On the 166th lap, he ran a record race lap of 229.118 mph, en route to a 15-second lead.\nOn laps 171–177, the field began circulating through a series of green-flag pit stops. It would be the final stops of the day. During the sequence, Al Sr. passed his son Al Jr. and led for four laps. After the field shuffled through their stops, Michael Andretti was back in the lead, by 23 seconds.\nFinish.\nWith 12 laps to go, Michael Andretti held a 28-second lead over Scott Goodyear. One lap later, Al Unser Jr. passed Goodyear for second place. On lap 189, Michael Andretti was pulling alongside Al Sr. to put him a lap down in turn two. Down the backstretch, however, Andretti suddenly began to slow. His fuel pump had failed, and the car coasted to a stop in the north short chute. Andretti had dominated nearly the entire race up to that point, and had led 160 of the first 189 laps.\nAl Unser Jr. suddenly inherited the lead, with Scott Goodyear right behind him in second. The caution came out for Andretti's stalled car, and the field bunched up for a late-race restart.\nWith 7 laps to go, the green flag came out, and the race was down to a tense two-man battle between Al Unser Jr. and Scott Goodyear. With four laps to go, Unser held a 0.3-second lead. The cars battled nose-to-tail around the entire track, with the savvy Unser holding off Goodyear. On the final lap, Goodyear drafted Unser down the backstretch, and tucked closely behind through the final turn. In turn four, Unser got loose, and claimed he had to back off the throttle slightly, and Goodyear pounced on the opportunity to close in. Out of the final turn, Goodyear zig-zagged behind Unser down the straightaway. A few hundred yards from the finish line, Goodyear pulled alongside, attempting a slingshot pass. Unser held him off officially by 0.043 seconds, less than one car length, the closest finish in Indy 500 history.\nAl Unser Sr. edged out Eddie Cheever by a split second for third place. A. J. Foyt brought his car home in 9th, while John Paul Jr., who nursed his car all day with a broken fuel cable, avoided all the crashes to finish 10th. Lyn St. James (11th place) clinched the rookie of the year award, as she was the only rookie left running. Danny Sullivan finished 5th, giving Galles/KRACO Racing two cars in the top five. It was Sullivan's first top ten since 1986. CART points leader Bobby Rahal also escaped the carnage, coming home 6th, and maintained his points lead.\nIt was the first of three bitter defeats in the Indy 500 for Scott Goodyear. Goodyear, an experienced road racer, was lauded by many for charging from last place (33rd) to nearly winning the race. It would have been the first time in Indy history that a driver won from the last starting position, and would have been Goodyear's first win in Indy car competition. Later in the year, he would triumph at the Michigan 500. In a post-race interview a disappointed but happy Goodyear said \"This is a real disappointment. When Michael Andretti lost the lead those last few laps I thought 'This is a real possibility.' It was a two-car race from there. I just couldn't get enough time against him and he just beat me. We just drove flat-out those last 3 laps and my Mackenzie team did a fantastic job. We had an up-and-down month and they gave me such a good race-car. I just needed a little more time to get him.\"\nIn victory lane, a very emotional Al Unser Jr. climbed from the cockpit, and was interviewed by ABC-TV's Jack Arute. When Arute noticed some tears behind Unser, Jr's voice, Unser Jr. responded in what would become one of the most famous quotes regarding victory at the Indianapolis 500:\nUnser's quote would be replayed in many subsequent airings, as well as during the intro for ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" in reference to the famous catchphrase \"The Thrill of Victory\".\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nLegacy.\nScott Goodyear's charge from 33rd starting position to second place marked the second time a driver had done so in Indy history, Tom Sneva went from 33rd to 2nd in 1980. The winning margin of Unser over Goodyear was later deemed to be closer than published. Unser's Galmer-Chevrolet placed its timing transponder in the nose of the car rather than the sidepod, the standard location in all the other cars. Goodyear's Lola lagged behind due to its placement of the transponder in the sidepod. USAC officials estimated an unofficial winning margin of 0.0331 seconds.\nThe exciting finish of the 1992 Indy 500 was overshadowed by the vast number of serious crashes during the month, including the fatal crash of Jovy Marcelo and the devastating injures suffered by both Nelson Piquet and Jeff Andretti. The crash-filled race saw 13 cautions for 85 laps, and the slowest average speed since 1958. Several drivers spent time in the hospital, while others required lengthy rehabilitation. At the next Indy car race at Detroit, several drivers required substitute drivers, including Mario Andretti, Rick Mears, and Hiro Matsushita.\nIn the aftermath of his crashes during practice and the race, Rick Mears raced only a partial schedule for the remainder of the 1992 season. He dropped out of the Michigan 500 due to the nagging injured wrist he suffered in his practice crash and abruptly retired from driving in December. The 1992 race was also the final start for A. J. Foyt, who would retire from the cockpit before the 1993 race.\nThe Andretti Family's misfortunes during the race reflected back to the Andretti Curse. Jeff Andretti's devastating leg injuries, Mario Andretti's foot injuries, and Michael Andretti's shocking late-race fuel pump failure collectively amounted to one of the worst examples of bad luck the family ever experienced at Indianapolis. Michael Andretti would not return to Indy for two years, due to his 1993 Formula One participation, and Jeff would qualify only one additional time in his career. A couple years later, family patriarch Mario reflected on the day in his autobiography \"Andretti\". With his youngest son Jeff undergoing surgery, himself recuperating in a hospital bed, and hearing of his other son Michael's heartbreaking loss, the elder Andretti called it the \"worst day of my life.\"\nDuring the summer of 1992, the track would be reconfigured for safety reasons. The apron at the bottom of the track was removed and replaced with a new warm up lane. The outside retaining wall was also replaced. These improvements were completed in time for the 1993 race.\nStatistics.\nThree-time winner Johnny Rutherford also attempted to qualify, but was too slow. With Al Unser Jr. a first-time winner, the field ultimately comprised 11 winners. In addition, Eddie Cheever and Buddy Lazier would eventually go on to win the race, bringing the winners total to 13 drivers (representing 26 victories) in the 1992 field.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Bob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the third year. Derek Daly served as the \"driver expert.\" Daly, who had experience on ESPN, replaced Johnny Rutherford for 1992, but this would be his only appearance on the network. The broadcast was heard on over 600 affiliates.\nBob Forbes conducted the winner's interview in victory lane. It would be the final time until 2004 that a separate interview would be conducted by the radio network crew. In subsequent years, the radio network would simulcast the winner's interview from television.\nOther than Daly, the rest of the crew remained the same from 1991. The 1992 race, notable for its windy and cold weather, saw the turn announcers reporting from admittedly uncomfortable locations.\nThe radio network call of the closest finish in Indy history was critically praised and replayed often. The last seconds of the call were included in a television commercial for Valvoline (Unser Jr.'s sponsor) which ran for several months following the race.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer, accompanied by Bobby Unser and Sam Posey. For the second time, Unser served as the pace car driver, and reported live from the pace car on the warm up laps.\nThe same exact crew from 1990 to 1991 returned. The 1992 broadcast is notable in that it missed the finish of the race. As Al Unser Jr. held off Scott Goodyear at the finish line, the director cut to a camera angle over the flagstand, and viewers were not able to see the leaders actually cross the line until a replay was shown.\nLocally, ABC affiliate WRTV arranged to air the race in same-day tape delay in the Indianapolis market. The race is blacked out in Indianapolis, and previously would not be shown locally until a week or two weeks after the race was held.\nThe broadcast registered a 10.9 rating (34 share) with 37 million viewers, the highest since going to a live broadcast in 1986. The final two hours peaked at 11.8/34.\nThe broadcast has re-aired numerous times on ESPN Classic since the mid-2000s.\n1991–92 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1991–92 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1991 and running through May 1992. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nAl Unser Jr., by virtue of winning the 1992 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1991–92 USAC Championship."

        "title": "1991 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 75th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday, May 26, 1991. Rick Mears won from the pole position, becoming the third four-time winner of the Indy 500, joining A. J. Foyt and Al Unser. During time trials, Mears also established an Indy record by winning his sixth career pole position. The month of May for Mears was tumultuous, as he suffered his first ever crash at Indy since arriving as a rookie in 1977. The wreck during a practice run totaled his primary car, and broke a bone in his right foot. Mears kept the injury mostly secret, and later admitted that the pain he experienced during the race was so bad, he had to cross his legs in the car and push the accelerator pedal down with his left foot.\nThe race was noteworthy in that it featured the first African American driver to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, Willy T. Ribbs. It also saw its first Japanese driver, Hiro Matsushita. The pre-race attention going into the month focused on A. J. Foyt, who was expected to retire from driving after the event. During time trials, Foyt qualified on the front row, his record 34th consecutive Indy appearance. On race day, however, Foyt dropped out early due to suspension damage. He eventually retracted his retirement plans, and returned one final time in 1992.\nDuring time trials, a sudden rain shower halted pole qualifying, unexpectedly shutting out several contenders from a chance at the front row. A number of top drivers were forced to qualify on the second day of time trials. Gary Bettenhausen in a Buick-powered machine was the surprise fastest qualifier, albeit he was ineligible for the pole position. For the first time in Indy history, four members of the same family qualified for the same race. Mario, Michael, Jeff, and John Andretti competed together. Michael, Mario, and John all finished in the top ten, while Jeff was named the Rookie of the Year. Michael Andretti led the most laps during the race and battled Rick Mears for the win in the closing laps. Andretti executed a daring pass for the lead on the outside of turn one on lap 187. Mears, however, made a similar pass one lap later to re-take the lead, and drove to victory. Michael's second-place finish would ultimately be his career best finish at Indy.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1991 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. Morning rain delayed the start of the race by about 55 minutes. The rain stopped, the track was dried, and the race was run to completion without interruption. Later in the year, Rick Mears would also win the Michigan 500, sweeping both 500-mile races for the season, the final two victories of his racing career.\nBackground.\nPre May News.\nA. J. Foyt suffered a crash at Road America in September 1990, which injured his feet and legs. Foyt recuperated and went through rehabilitation during the offseason. He initially planned to race at Indy one final time in 1991, then retire from driving.\nOnly a few team/driver changes occurred during the offseason, while most of the key fixtures from 1990 remained on the same respective teams. Among the handful of changes, Danny Sullivan departed Penske Racing, and joined the Pat Patrick Alfa Romeo effort. Rick Mears' familiar Pennzoil Z-7 Special livery was gone for 1991, as the Penske team (Mears and Fittipaldi) became a two-car team with Marlboro sponsoring both cars.\nDoug Shierson Racing, who won the 1990 race with driver Arie Luyendyk, was sold to businessman Bob Tezak. The team was re-organized in a joint effort with Vince Granatelli, and re-booted as UNO/Granatelli Racing. The car's former sponsor Domino's Pizza left the sport, and the livery was changed to the classic day-glow orange utilized by Granatelli entries over the years. Luyendyk's services were retained for 1991 (he won earlier in the season at Phoenix), but the entry suffered from a lack of sponsorship. During most of the season, the car had blank sidepods, but RCA sponsored the entry at Indy.\nJohn Andretti joined the newly rebooted Hall-VDS team, taking over the Pennzoil sponsorship. Andretti kicked off the season by winning his first (and only) career CART race at the season opener, the Gold Coast Grand Prix at Surfers Paradise.\nAl Unser Jr. and Bobby Rahal returned together at Galles/KRACO Racing. Unser, the 1990 CART champion, won at Long Beach. Rahal started off the season finishing second at all three of the races prior to Indianapolis.\nAfter sitting out the 1990 season due to injury, Scott Pruett was back behind the wheel at Truesports. The team introduced its brand new \"All-American\" Truesports 91C chassis, powered by Judd. For the second year in a row, veteran Geoff Brabham was entered at Indy only for a second team car.\nDerrick Walker, formerly associated with the Penske and Porsche teams, entered rookie Willy T. Ribbs at Walker Racing. On a shoestring budget, the team was considered a long-shot to make the field.\nPace car controversy.\nThe pace car for the 1991 Indy 500 was initially chosen to be the Dodge Stealth. However, the UAW, along with fans and traditionalists, protested since the Stealth was a captive import built by Mitsubishi in Japan. Traditionally, the make of the pace car has always been a domestic American brand. In late February, the Stealth was downgraded to be the \"festival\" (driven by the event's dignitaries for promotional purposes) and backup pace car. The pre-production Dodge Viper RT/10 replaced the Stealth as the official pace car when the track opened in May. Carroll Shelby served as the driver, thought to be the first person to drive the pace car after having a heart transplant. It was Shelby's second appearance at Indy. He had also driven the pace car in 1987. As the Viper did not begin production until later that year, the race winner would win the Stealth instead of the Viper, and dealers sold pace car replica editions of the Stealth.\nPractice - week 1.\nThe first two days of practice (May 4 &amp; May 5) were rained out. The only on-track activity was brief. A limited number of cars took \"shake down\" laps, but no laps were run at speed.\nMonday May 6.\nThe first hot laps were run on Monday May 6. Penske teammates Emerson Fittipaldi (223.981 mph) and Rick Mears (223.430 mph) led the speed chart.\nTuesday May 7.\nRick Mears ran the fastest lap thus far at 226.569 mph. Gary Bettenhausen also gained attention with a lap of 224.888 mph in the stock block Buick V-6.\nWednesday May 8.\nJim Crawford hit 225.643 mph in a Buick on Wednesday May 8, and Bobby Rahal became the second driver over 226 mph, with a lap of 226.080 to lead the speed chart for the day.\nThursday May 9.\nThe speed of the stock block Buicks continued to impress as Kevin Cogan turned a lap of 226.677 mph on Thursday May 9.\nFriday May 10 - \"Fast Friday\".\nOn \"Fast Friday,\" the final day of practice before time trials, Rick Mears shocked the establishment, suffering his first-ever crash at Indy. Something broke in the rear of the car, sending him spinning into the turn one wall. Mears suffered an injured right foot, and was cleared to drive later in the day. Later in the day, Emerson Fittipaldi set the fastest lap of the month at 226.705 mph, and became the favorite for the pole. At 5:09 p.m., rookie Mark Dismore lost traction coming out of turn 4, while travelling an estimated 215 mph. His car first slid across the track, clipping the inside wall near the entrance to the pits, then struck the dividing barrier between the pits and the main straightaway head-on. Dismore's car broke into two pieces which both tumbled into the pit lane. Dismore suffered multiple injuries to his arms, legs, and feet, and a fractured neck; and was sidelined for the year. Dismore's incident was similar in both track location and crash trajectory to that of Swede Savage's fatal crash in the 1973 Indianapolis 500.\nAs a result of Dismore's crash, officials made a quick change in the pits in the interest of safety for the crews. The two northernmost pit stalls were removed, and replaced instead at the south end of the pit lane. The move added about 80 feet of buffer from the track surface to the first pit box.\nTime Trials - First weekend.\nPole Day - Saturday May 11.\nPole day was held on Saturday May 11, and conditions were hot and humid. A. J. Foyt drew #1 in the qualifying order, and was the first car out on the track. Foyt put himself on the provisional pole position, with a four-lap run of 222.443 mph. The second car out to qualify was Randy Lewis, who wrecked in turn one on his first lap.\nAbout an hour into the session, Mario Andretti completed a run of 221.818 mph, which put him tentatively on the front row. Several cars waved off their runs, and others simply pulled out of line, preferring to wait until later in the day, anticipating better conditions. Bobby Rahal, Michael Andretti, and his brother rookie Jeff Andretti completed runs. By 12:45 p.m., there were only eight cars in the field.\nAt 12:51 p.m., Rick Mears took to the track, one day after suffering his practice crash. He qualified for the pole position with a speed of 224.113 mph. It was not a track record, but it would be Mears' record sixth Indy 500 pole. The track went mostly quiet during the heat of the day, and only two cars went out over the next 2½ hours.\nAt 3:52 p.m., Emerson Fittipaldi made his first attempt. After three laps in the 223 mph range (fast enough for second starting position, but not fast enough for the pole), his crew waved him off. Not realizing that storm clouds were hovering just to the east, the team planned to go out later and make another run at the pole position. A few minutes later, John Andretti completed his run under a light mist falling at the north end of the track. Lightning from the gathering storm clouds actually struck near turn 3 while the main straightaway remained awash in sunshine. The sun quickly gave way to the storm and the rain washed out the remainder of the day.\nSince the original qualifying order had exhausted before the rains came, pole day was officially over. Only twelve cars qualified, and several drivers were left out, including Emerson Fittipaldi, Arie Luyendyk, and Gary Bettenhausen. Roger Penske was later presented with the dubious Jigger Award for having waved off Fittipaldi's run, and effectively giving up second starting position. Meanwhile, the front row was established with Rick Mears on the pole, A. J. Foyt in the middle, and Mario Andretti on the outside. Historians point to this as one of the most storied and historic front rows in Indy history.\nSecond Day - Sunday May 12.\nMany of the drivers who were left out of qualifying a day earlier returned to qualify on Sunday May 12. The first 45 minutes of the day saw heavy action. Gary Bettenhausen took to the track and completed his run at 224.468 mph, faster than Mears' pole speed, making him the fastest qualifier in the field. Since he was a second-day qualifier, however, he was forced to line up behind the first-day qualifiers, in 13th position.\nArie Luyendyk's qualifying run of 223.881 mph made him the third fastest car in the field, but his second-day status lined him up 14th. Emerson Fittipaldi finally made the field, qualifying 15th at 223.065 mph. The three cars of the 5th row (Bettenhausen, Luyendyk, Fittipaldi) ended up qualifying faster than the three cars of the front row.\nThe rest of the day saw light action with only one major incident, an accident from Dominic Dobson in turn four which fractured his left leg, wiping out the Burns team 89 Lola, but the injury was not sufficient enough to sideline him. However, the crash forced Dominic into a backup 89 Lola that was purchased from Truesports (Truesports ran the car during the 1990 season to save money while developing their own chassis). At the end of the day, the field was filled to 22 cars.\nPractice - Week 2.\nThe second week of practice focused on the non-qualified drivers, and those still looking for rides. Rookie Willy T. Ribbs passed his drivers test on Monday, but suffered through multiple engine failures during the week. Ribbs managed a practice lap of 213.230 mph, but as practice came to a close, it appeared doubtful he might be able to qualify.\nAmong the drivers named to rides during the week were former winners Gordon Johncock and Tom Sneva. The Patrick Racing Alfa-Romeo team added Roberto Guerrero (their primary driver from 1990) for a second team car. Al Unser Sr., however, was unable to secure a competitive ride, and decided to sit out the race. Initially Unser was expected to drive a back-up car to Arie Luyendyk at UNO/Granatelli Racing, but engine lease issues, and the lack of adequate preparation time prevented the deal from coming to fruition. Unser missed the race for the first time since 1969, the year he broke his leg in a motorcycle crash in the infield the night before time trials.\nRookie Hiro Matsushita led the speed chart for the non-qualified drivers most of the week, with a top lap of 216.570 mph. Roberto Guerrero quickly got up to speed in the Alfa Romeo, with the fastest lap of the week (216.941 mph).\nTwo days during the second week of practice, Tuesday (May 14) and Thursday (May 16), saw limited track activity due to rain. After concerns earlier in the month about a short field, going into the final weekend of time trials, enough rides had materialized to ensure a full 33-car field.\nTime Trials - Second weekend.\nThird Day - Saturday May 18.\nTwelve cars made attempts in the first hour, and the field was filled to 29 cars. Rookie Hiro Matsushita was the fastest car of the day, qualifying at 218.141 mph, officially becoming the first Japanese driver to qualify for the Indy 500. Other notable qualifiers included Roberto Guerrero, John Paul Jr., and Scott Pruett. Tom Sneva completed a slow run of 213.189 mph, and he sat as the slowest car in the field.\nTwo crashes occurred during the day. Dean Hall crashed in the morning practice session, and Ted Prappas wrecked in turn 4 later in the afternoon. Both drivers would miss the race.\nWilly T. Ribbs' frustrations continued, as his car revved too high, and he broke a valve on his warmup lap.\nBump Day - Sunday May 19.\nFour positions remained open on the final day of time trials. Gordon Johncock was the first driver to complete an attempt, and took a run of 213.812 mph. A few minutes later, Willy T. Ribbs' car started smoking and spewing oil, and suffered a turbocharger failure. Yet another engine-related headache for the team. The team scrambled to replace the turbo, but then discovered a damaged scavenger pump, which delayed them further.\nAt 2:45 p.m., Pancho Carter filled the field to 33 cars. Tom Sneva (213.189 mph) was now on the bubble.\nAt about 3:30 p.m., Willy T. Ribbs finally returned to the track to shake down the car. He ran a few practice laps, and was quickly over 214 mph. At 5:05 p.m., the team placed the car in the tech line, and prepared to qualify. With much anticipation from fans and the media, Ribbs completed the four-lap qualifying run at a speed of 217.358 mph, the fastest laps he had run all month. On his cool-down lap, an ecstatic Ribbs hoisted himself partially out of his seat, waving and cheering with both hands out of the cockpit as he pulled into the pits. Ribbs bumped former winner Tom Sneva, and was comfortably in the field.\nRandy Lewis was the final car to complete an attempt, and he bumped Johnny Parsons from the field. In the final 15 minutes, three drivers took to the track, but all three waved off. Gordon Johncock survived the bubble, and held on to qualify 33rd.\nRace recap.\nStart.\nMorning rain delayed the start of the race by 55 minutes. Mary F. Hulman gave the command to start engines at 11:46 a.m., and the field pulled away. Danny Sullivan's Alfa Romeo car suffered a fuel pump problem, and was he pushed back to the pits. Observers also noted that the engine in the car of Willy T. Ribbs did not sound right. The field circulated for three warm-up laps (two parade laps and one pace lap).\nAt the start, polesitter Rick Mears took the lead into turn one. Gary Bettenhausen got sideways in turn 1, causing Buddy Lazier to swerve and tag the outside wall with his nosecone. The caution came out, and both Bettenhausen and Lazier made it back to the pits. Bettenhausen changed tires and continued, but Lazier's car was too damaged to continue.\nAfter quick repairs, Danny Sullivan joined the race right after the field took the green flag. However, since he missed the three warm-up laps, he was given a three-lap penalty, and was not scored until his fourth time around (so as to match the other cars). On lap 5, Willy T. Ribbs pulled into the pits with a misfire, and dropped out.\nFirst half.\nMears gave up the lead to Mario Andretti on lap 12. Michael Andretti then took the lead and dominated most of the first half.\nOn lap 25, Kevin Cogan and Roberto Guerrero clipped wheels in turn one, and the two cars crashed hard into the outside wall. Guerrero was unhurt, but Cogan suffered injuries to his right shoulder and forearm. Debris from the crash littered the track, and A. J. Foyt ran over a large piece of debris, breaking his left front suspension. Foyt limped back to the pits, waving to the crowd, as he felt his day was done. The crowd gave him an ovation as he walked back to the garage area, but he was still non-committal to his retirement decision.\nCogan assigned Guerrero the responsibility for the crash in interviews that evening, and maintained that stance even later in life. Footage from the broadcast was inconclusive of what caused the Cogan-Guerrero crash. At some point later, however, amateur footage shot from a spectator in the grandstand emerged that showed that Cogan may have come down on Guerrero. Blame for the crash has never been fully vetted.\nSeveral cars began dropping out due to mechanical problems. Jim Crawford, John Paul Jr., Mike Groff, Tero Palmroth, and Gary Bettenhausen were all out of the race before the halfway point.\nAt the halfway point, Michael Andretti continued to lead, with Emerson Fittipaldi holding onto second. Teammates Bobby Rahal and Al Unser Jr. were strong top five contenders. Rick Mears barely clung to the lead lap, and was in danger of being lapped at one point.\nSecond half.\nMichael Andretti continued his dominance, but Emerson Fittipaldi was now a strong challenger. Fittipaldi took the lead on lap 113, and held it for a total of 46 laps in the second half. Fittipaldi suffered a gearbox failure exiting the pits on lap 171, and dropped out the race.\nThe field dwindled down to only about 13 cars for the final 50 laps. Early contender Bobby Rahal blew an engine on lap 130, followed by Scott Brayton, who also blew an engine on lap 149. Mario Andretti faded in the second half, falling two laps down and out of contention for the win. Only two cars remained on the lead lap - Michael Andretti and Rick Mears. Arie Luyendyk moved into third, one lap down, with Al Unser Jr. also in the top five. Unser's car though was suffering from wastegate problems.\nGordon Johncock, who started 33rd, and was suffering from flu-like symptoms before the race, was now in the top ten.\nFinish.\nOn lap 183, Danny Sullivan blew his engine down the frontstretch, spewing a huge cloud of smoke, and bringing out the caution flag. Leader Michael Andretti took advantage of the break, and ducked into the pits for much-needed fuel. Andretti's stop was quick, and he came back out onto the track in second. He lined up just behind leader Rick Mears for the restart.\nAs the leaders came down for the restart to complete lap 186, Andretti diced back and forth down the frontstretch, and passed Mears on the outside of turn one to take the lead in dramatic fashion. It was a rare move drivers would seldom attempt. Immediately after the pass Andretti began to pull away, but Mears reeled him back in after the exit of turn four. At the end of the main stretch, not to be upstaged, Mears pulled the same move, passing Andretti on the outside of turn one to re-take the lead. Almost immediately, Mears began pulling away from Andretti, as Andretti's handling began to go away.\nWith only 11 laps to go, Mears began to lengthen his lead. Suddenly on lap 190, Andretti's father Mario Andretti stalled at the entrance to the pits. The yellow flag came out for the tow-in and bunched the field for another restart. A controversy erupted, as many felt Mario stopped on purpose in a ploy to aid his son. Mario denied this post-race, saying that he only warned Michael that \"Whether he needs a yellow or not, I'm creating one because I can't make it to the pits.\"\nThe green flag came out with six laps to go, and Mears got the jump on the restart. Michael Andretti's handling was not improving, and he was unable to challenge Mears for the lead. Mears cruised over the final five laps to the finish line, and became the third four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500.\nIn a 2011 interview, Michael Andretti and Roger Penske both stated that had Andretti managed to put Mears a lap down, it likely would have been over for Mears. What changed the complexity of the race was that Andretti suffered a cut tire just before he could have lapped Mears.\nBox score.\n' = Indianapolis 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Bob Jenkins served as chief announcer for the second year. Johnny Rutherford returned as \"driver expert\" and Bob Forbes conducted the winner's interview in victory lane. The network celebrated its 40th anniversary.\nFor 1991, the backstretch reporting location was eliminated permanently. Howdy Bell, who revived the position from 1989 to 1990, moved into the booth to serve as \"Statistician.\" Bell updated the running order for the entire field in 25-lap intervals. With Ron Carrell's departure, Chris McClure joined the crew as a new pit reporter.\nDue to the rain delay, the broadcast signed on at 10:00 EST, but only for a weather report. The airtime was sent back to the affiliates to wait out the delay. Updates were given through the hour, and the network came back on-air for an abbreviated pre-race show. The race itself, however, was carried in its entirety.\nTechnical director Tom Allebrandi celebrated his 25th year working the broadcast. Longtime network veteran Ralph \"Luke\" Walton, who served on the crew for the final time in 1988, died on June 18, 1990, at the age of 83.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer, accompanied by Bobby Unser and Sam Posey. The start of the race was delayed about one hour, and ABC filled the time with interviews, highlights, and other features.\nThe same exact crew from 1990 returned. To commemorate the 75th anniversary race, Jack Whitaker joined the pre-race coverage as an essayist.\nRick Mears was the first Indy 500 winner to carry an onboard camera for the television broadcast. The top four finishers happened to all be carrying on-board cameras, as well as the pace car. Bobby Rahal also carried a camera, but he dropped out early in the second half.\n1990–91 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1990–91 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1990 and running through May 1991. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nRick Mears, by virtue of winning the 1991 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1990–91 USAC Championship."

        "text": "The 74th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 27, 1990. Dutchman Arie Luyendyk took the lead with 32 laps to go, and earned his first-ever victory in championship-level competition. It was the second consecutive year the Indy 500 was won by a foreign-born competitor, the first time that had occurred since 1965–1966. Luyendyk completed the 500 miles at an average speed of , a record that stood for 23 years until 2013. In reference to the long-standing speed record, the 1990 race had often been referred to as \"The Fastest 500.\"\nDefending champion Emerson Fittipaldi started on the pole position and dominated the first half of the race. Setting a new track record in qualifying, Fittipaldi became the first driver to break the 225 mph barrier in time trials. He was looking to become the first back-to-back winner in twenty years. In the second half of the race, however, he fell victim to blistering tires, fell a lap down, and wound up finishing third. Bobby Rahal, the 1986 winner, was in position to win his second Indy 500, but he too suffered handling problems, which dropped him to second at the finish.\nA. J. Foyt, making his 33rd consecutive Indy start, finished in sixth place. Rookie Jeff Andretti attempted to become the unprecedented fourth member of the Andretti family to qualify for the same race, but was bumped on the final day of time trials.\nRain hampered much of the month, washing out nearly the entire first weekend of time trials as well as two practice days. The 1990 race was also the first Indy 500 presided over by Tony George, who was named president of the Speedway in January.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1990 CART PPG Indy Car World Series.\nBackground.\nRule changes.\nControversy hovered over the month, regarding new aerodynamic rules. All teams utilizing 1989 (or older) model year chassis were required to affix a \"diffuser\" to the underbody ground effects tunnels, to reduce their depth by 2 inches - a rule intended to reduce downforce and curtail speeds. Competitors complained that the diffusers made their cars unstable and unbalanced, and were responsible for the increased number of practice crashes involving the older cars. Despite voiced complaints and meetings with officials, no changes were made to the rules. Ultimately, no major crashes occurred amongst the older cars during the race itself.\nThe Porsche Indycar team, led by Derrick Walker, was fresh off their first victory at Mid-Ohio in September 1989 with driver Teo Fabi. They planned to roll out a new March chassis for 1990, the first all-carbon fiber monocoque Indy car. Rules were evolving by the CART series (and likewise USAC) to eventually allow for all-carbon fiber chassis. Porsche interpreted the rules as permitting the car for 1990, provided they were granted a waiver, and embarked on the project. However, in January, the board of directors voted to disallow the chassis for competition in 1990. The Porsche team was forced to utilize a March chassis that was constructed with a then-standard aluminum bottom to adhere to the rules. All-carbon fiber monocoques would be delayed until 1991.\nWith the Pocono 500 disbanded after 1989, the 1990 Indy car season and beyond would no longer feature a \"Triple crown\" of 500-mile races. The triple crown would not return until 2013.\nTeam and driver changes.\nTeam and driver changes for 1990 were highlighted by defending CART champion and defending Indy winner Emerson Fittipaldi (and sponsor Marlboro) departing Patrick Racing and joining Penske Racing. The Penske team would be a three-car effort in 1990 with Fittipaldi, Rick Mears, and Danny Sullivan.\nMeanwhile, Chip Ganassi took over the assets of the former Patrick Racing, and it became Chip Ganassi Racing. Eddie Cheever, who had spent the past decade in Formula One, and was the United States' lone F1 participant, switched to the CART series for 1990 and took the seat. Target was brought in as the new sponsor for the budding team, beginning one of the longest tenures for an Indy car sponsor (1990-2016) in the history of the sport.\nKRACO Racing (Bobby Rahal) owned by Maurice Kraines, merged with the Rick Galles team. They became a two-car effort known as Galles-KRACO Racing. Al Unser Jr. returned in the Valvoline-sponsored entry, and Rahal got the use of the Chevy Ilmor V-8 engine for the first time.\nArie Luyendyk left Dick Simon Racing, and joined Doug Shierson Racing to drive the #30 Domino's Pizza \"Hot One\" Chevrolet entry. After the previous two years utilizing Judd power, Shierson also was granted a lease for the Chevy Ilmor engine.\nTruesports driver Scott Pruett, who won the rookie of the year award in 1989, had a serious crash at West Palm Beach during preseason testing. He suffered serious leg injuries, and was forced to sit out the season for rehabilitation. Raul Boesel was hired to drive as a substitute. The Truesports team was already in development of their in-house \"All American\" chassis, which was scheduled to debut in 1991. For the 1990 season, the team utilized 1989 Lola/Judd machines to save cost. However, they re-fabricated the underbody of the cars in order to adhere to the new rules specifications, and avoided the need to use the aforementioned \"diffusers\".\nThe Alfa Romeo Indy car effort, formerly headed up by Alex Morales Motorsports, was taken over in 1990 by a re-booted Patrick Racing. The Alfa Romeo engine had not been ready in time to race at the 1989 Indy 500, therefore 1990 would its first appearance at Indy. Roberto Guerrero, who drove for Morales in 1989, was kept on as the driver for 1990 at Patrick. Al Unser Sr., released by Penske, was brought in to enter a second team car at Indy and the other 500-miler at Michigan. Patrick Racing assumed the sponsorship of Miller, previously associated with Penske. It was another \"trade\" between the two organizations.\nConstruction.\nDuring the offseason, the Tower Terrace Extension grandstand was razed at the north end of the pit area. In its place, a new 900-foot long, 17,000-seat permanent double-decker grandstand was constructed. It featured aluminum chair-back bench seating, as well as modern restroom facilities and storefront space on the lower level. On the upper deck, 38 luxury suites were built, each with seats for 80 people.\nIn the south short-chute, near the museum, the first dedicated Wheelchair Accessible grandstand was constructed. With seating for 302 persons, (including non-handicapped \"companion\" seating), the Speedway introduced its first ADA-compliant grandstand.\nAcross the street from turn one, a famous Speedway landmark, the brick smokestack of the former Prest-O-Lite company was demolished. For decades, the smokestack was said to be used by drivers to see clues about wind speed and direction. It was taken down by wrecking ball just two months after the 1990 race.\nPractice (first week).\nDuring rookie orientation, driver Steve Barclay was injured in a crash, and was forced to sit out practice.\nOpening day – Saturday May 5.\nTero Palmroth of Dick Simon Racing earned the honor of first car out on the track on opening day.\nThe first day of practice saw moderate activity, with Tom Sneva in a Buick-powered entry setting the fastest lap (215.646 mph).\nSeveral drivers (Al Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi, Geoff Brabham, Bobby Rahal, and Danny Sullivan) were not present for opening day due to their participation in the first round of IROC XIV at Talladega. Unser Jr., who finished second in that race, along with Rahal, did make it to Indianapolis in time to take a few practice laps.\nSunday May 6.\nHistory was made at Indy when four members of the same family practiced on the track at the same time. Mario, Michael, John, and Jeff Andretti all were on the track together for a brief time at 3:35 p.m.\nJim Crawford crashed in turn one 20 minutes before the track closed for the day.\nEmerson Fittipaldi, taking his first laps of the month, topped the speed chart with a lap of 222.607 mph.\nMonday May 7.\nThree crashes occurred on Monday. Johnny Rutherford, rookie Buddy Lazier, and Bill Vukovich III all suffered wall contact. Lazier hit the outside wall at the exit of turn four. Rutherford went high exiting turn two, and brushed the wall. Vukovich was the most serious, crashing hard in turn one, suffering a concussion.\nRick Mears (224.398 mph) set the fastest lap, with Arie Luyendyk (222.816 mph) second and Emerson Fittipaldi (222.211 mph) third.\nTuesday May 8.\nEmerson Fittipaldi (223.286 mph) was the fastest of the day. Steve Chassey crashed in turn three.\nWednesday May 9.\nJohnny Rutherford had his second crash of the month. He spun in turn three, and crashed hard into the outside wall, suffering a concussion and knee injury.\nAl Unser Jr. (220.507 mph) was the fastest of the day. Arie Luyendyk was second-fastest once again.\nThursday May 10.\nA cold, windy afternoon kept most cars off the track. Jim Crawford, driving his back-up car, was the fastest of the day at only 208.686 mph. Only two cars turned laps over 200 mph, and of the 12 drivers that completed laps, few took any laps at speed.\nThe track was closed 51 minutes early due to weather conditions. Only 74 laps were turned all day.\nFriday May 11.\nOn the final day of practice before time trials, the speeds climbed, and activity was heavy. At least 40 drivers took to the track, completing 1,517 laps.\nTwo minor crashes occurred early in the afternoon. Rookies Jeff Wood and Jeff Andretti both suffered accidents. Wood hit the outside wall exiting turn one, then brushed it three more times as the car came to a stop. He was uninjured. Andretti spun in turn four, hitting the outside wall. The car was heavily damaged, but Andretti suffered only a bruised knee.\nShortly after 4 p.m., Emerson Fittipaldi rans laps of 227.101 mph and 227.181 mph. They were the fastest unofficial laps in Indy history. Not to be upstaged, at 5:09 p.m., Al Unser Jr. blistered the track with a lap of 228.502 mph, the fastest practice lap ever run at Indy.\nAt 5:24 p.m., Jim Crawford suffered his second crash of the week. This accident, which occurred in the south short chute, was spectacular. He spun in turn one, hit the outside wall, then as the car came off wall, debris lifted the chassis airborne. It flew approximately 15–20 feet off the ground for as much as 280 feet, then came to the ground, upright. It continued to slide for another 360 feet and came to rest along the inside wall. Crawford was not seriously injured.\nThe first week of practice ended with Unser Jr., Fittipaldi, Rick Mears, and Mario Andretti topping the speed chart. All four had run laps over 225 mph.\nTime trials (first weekend).\nPole Day Part 1 – Saturday May 12.\nPole day was scheduled for Saturday May 12, with Al Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi the favorites for the pole position. Rain washed out the entire day. Pole qualifying was rescheduled for Sunday.\nPole Day Part 2 – Sunday May 13.\nOn Sunday, rain threatened to wash out the entire weekend. Continuing rain, cool temperatures and \"weepers\" kept the cars off the track until after 2:30 p.m. Emerson Fittipaldi was the first driver to make a qualifying attempt, as time trials finally got underway at 4:34 p.m.\nFittipaldi set new one and four-lap qualifying records to secure the provisional pole position. Each lap increased in speed. He became the first driver to officially break the 225 mph barrier at Indy.\nA hectic, abbreviated qualifying session saw 16 attempts before the track closed at 6 p.m. Rick Mears (224.215 mph) and Bobby Rahal (222.694 mph) tentatively rounded out the front row. The day ended when Rich Vogler wrecked in turn two on his third qualifying lap.\nSeveral drivers including Danny Sullivan, Al Unser Jr., Arie Luyendyk, and A. J. Foyt, were left waiting in line at the 6 o'clock gun. They would have to wait until the following Saturday to have a shot at the pole position. Time trials was scheduled to pick up with the remainder of the pole round on Saturday.\nScott Brayton took to the track for his attempt, but his crew forgot to wave the green flag to start the run. His run was negated, and he lost his opportunity to qualify in the pole position round.\nPractice (second week).\nMonday May 14.\nArie Luyendyk, who was not able to qualify yet, was the fastest car of the day at 221.773 mph. Al Unser Jr. concentrated on race day setups instead, and ran a lap of 220.496 mph.\nTuesday May 15.\nPractice was rained out.\nWednesday May 16.\nPractice was rained out.\nThursday May 17.\nArie Luyendyk again led the speed chart, with a lap of 217.854 mph. Rookie Guido Daccò passed his rookie test, and Salt Walther took to the track for the first time.\nFriday May 18.\nAl Unser Jr. re-established himself as a threat for the pole position, running a lap of 224.995 mph, the fastest of the day. But before the day was over, he blew his qualifying engine, and the team was forced to install a back-up engine for time trials.\nArie Luyendyk was second-fastest at 223.586 mph, also making him a threat for the front row. Bernard Jourdain wrecked twice in three hours, first in his backup car, then in his primary car, requiring surgery and ending his month.\nTime trials (second weekend).\nPole Day Part 3 – Saturday May 19.\nOn Saturday May 19, pole qualifying resumed, with 16 cars still eligible for the pole round. Arie Luyendyk (223.304 mph) squeezed onto the front row, bumping Bobby Rahal back to row two. The highly anticipated run by Al Unser Jr. was a disappointment, as he only managed 220.920 mph, putting him in 7th starting position.\nBy holding on to the second starting position, Rick Mears qualified on the front row for a record 10th time in his career. A total of 23 cars qualified during the pole round, and at 11:45 a.m., the original qualifying draw had exhausted. Emerson Fittipaldi officially won the pole position. It was the second year in a row the defending champion had won the pole, and Penske Racing swept 1st-2nd on the grid.\n\"Third day\" qualifying commenced at 11:50 a.m., with Johnny Rutherford waving off a slow run. Scott Brayton, who missed his chance to qualify on Sunday, put in a solid speed, as did Teo Fabi, who also missed out on the pole round. The two Alfa Romeo entries of Roberto Guerrero and Al Unser, Sr. put their cars safely in the field, as did Tom Sneva in a Buick.\nAt 5:45 p.m., the field was filled to 33 cars, Mike Groff (203.643 mph) on the bubble. Jim Crawford then easily bumped out Groff. After two crashes, and two slow qualifying attempts, Johnny Rutherford (204.801 mph) was now on the bubble. Stan Fox bumped him out by over 9 mph, and for the second year in a row, Rutherford was in a position to miss the race.\nBump Day – Sunday May 20.\nBump Day saw rain in the morning, and the track did not open until 2:30 p.m. As the day opened, rookie Buddy Lazier (209.418 mph) was on the bubble. After two attempts, John Paul Jr. was able to bump out Lazier.\nIn the final 20 minutes, Salt Walther (attempting to make a comeback to racing) took to the track for his first qualifying attempt in ten years. Rookie Jeff Andretti (210.268 mph) was on the bubble. Andretti was trying to qualify for the first time, and also be the fourth member of the Andretti family to qualify for the same race. Walther completed his run at 210.558 mph, just fast enough to bump Andretti.\nIn the final 8 minutes, Walther was on the bubble, trying to hold on to the 33rd and final starting position. Johnny Rutherford made one last futile effort to bump his way in, but waved off after only two laps. That allowed just enough time for Rocky Moran to take to the track. His speed of 211.076 mph bumped out Salt Walther at the 6 o'clock gun, and the field was set for race day.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nAfter rain on Saturday, race day dawned sunny and warm. Temperatures were higher than expected, which ultimately led to poor chassis set ups and handling problems for many drivers.\nEmerson Fittipaldi took the lead from the start, and dominated the opening laps. The start was clean, and went 19 laps before the first caution. In turn one, Danny Sullivan's car broke a suspension piece, which sent his car spinning and he crashed hard into the outside wall.\nFirst half.\nWith Fittipaldi continuing to dominate, the top five was being battled amongst Bobby Rahal, Al Unser Jr., and Arie Luyendyk. Rick Mears dropped back with handling issues, and fell a lap down.\nTony Bettenhausen Jr. brought out the second caution, when he stalled in lap 45. He was towed back to the pits, and would continue for a time in the race. On lap 63, Mario Andretti and Raul Boesel suffered engine failures, and oil was reported on the track. At the same time, Pancho Carter slowed down the backstretch with a broken CV joint. In turn four, he spun due to the bad handling, and tagged the wall in turn 4. Carter was uninjured.\nEmerson Fittipaldi continued to lead, and set a new Indy record by leading the first 92 consecutive laps. He lost the lead on lap 93 when he pitted. Arie Luyendyk took the lead for two laps, then relinquished the lead back to Fittipaldi when he himself pitted.\nAt the halfway point, Fittipaldi had led 98 laps and was averaging 174.192 mph, just shy of the race record.\nSecond half.\nBlistering tires began to be an issue with several drivers. The fast pace and the changing weather conditions were both factors. On lap 116, Emerson Fittipaldi ducked into the pits for a scheduled pit stop. That allowed Bobby Rahal to take the lead for the first time. The rest of the leaders cycled through stops, and Fittipaldi once again found the lead.\nOn lap 136, leader Fittipaldi suddenly entered the pits for an unscheduled pit stop. He was the victim of a blistered right rear tire. Bobby Rahal took over the lead, and began to pull away. Arie Luyendyk was now running second, with Fittipaldi dropping to third, just in front of fourth place Al Unser Jr.\nOn lap 140, John Andretti brushed the wall in turn four, damaging the suspension. He continued down the frontstretch, and spun lazily in turn 1. It would be the final caution period of the day. Leader Bobby Rahal pitted under the caution, taking on fuel and only two tires (right sides only). The team was expressing concern about changing all four, as many teams were blistering tires. Luyendyk, however, took on four tires and fuel. Rahal and Luyendyk came back out on the track in that order, a few cars ahead of third place Fittipaldi.\nOn lap 153, Fittipaldi was forced to make another unscheduled pit stop for yet another blistered tire. This time he fell a lap down. He slipped to fourth, with Al Unser Jr. passing him for third.\nBobby Rahal continued to lead, but handling problems were starting to slow his pace. Having taken on only two tires, coupled with a damaged wing adjuster, was causing a pushing condition. Arie Luyendyk began to reel him in, and took over the lead with a pass in turn three on lap 168. Going into the race, Luyendyk had never led a lap at Indy, and had never won an Indy car race.\nFinish.\nBoth Luyendyk and Rahal needed one final pit stop to make it to the finish. Rahal pitted first, on lap 171. Luyendyk followed two laps later, and was able to get back out on the track ahead of Rahal. With Al Unser Jr. 30 seconds behind in third place, and Fittipaldi now a lap down in fourth, the race became a two-man duel between Luyendyk and Rahal - with Rahal seemingly unable to close the gap. Some observers were unsure if Luyendyk and Rahal could make it to the finish on fuel, but neither team planned to pit.\nIn the final twenty laps, Luyendyk began to pick up the pace, and the average speed began to climb, well above the existing record. Al Unser Jr.'s chance at a third place were dashed when he was forced to make a pit stop for fuel on lap 187. Fittipaldi passed him for third, and set his sights on Luyendyk, trying to get his lap back. Luyendyk had begun to experience minor blistering on his tires, but not enough to cause concern. Rahal was still trailing in second place by over ten seconds.\nWith three laps to go, Luyendyk led Rahal by 13.3 seconds. Third place Emerson Fittipaldi caught Luyendyk, and was attempting to un-lap himself. After closely pursuing for a couple laps he made his move on Luyendyk. Fittipaldi did so on the main stretch with one lap to go, which distracted Luyendyk, and he did not see the white flag. The next time around, the checkered flag was displayed, and Luyendyk won his first-career Indy car race.\nIn victory lane an emotional Luyendyk was thrilled over his victory stating in a post-race interview: \"I can't believe this. It feels like a dream. This is unbelievable. I don't care if we won by 60 miles per hour we still got first place and that's what counts.\"\nThird place Emerson Fittipaldi was disappointed about not repeating his victory after dominating the race. \"“I’m very disappointed,”\" Fittipaldi said. \"“It was a shame. Everything was under control. The car, she was flying. It’s the third time I’ve been leading and something happened. It seems that for my wins here, I have to be striving and then I can win.”\"\nLegacy.\nThe record average speed of marked the fastest Indy 500 to-date, and the fastest 500-mile Indy car race to-date. The 500-mile speed record would later be broken at the 1990 Michigan 500. The 1990 average speed record would stand until 2013.\nEddie Cheever was the highest finishing rookie in 8th place. He was also named the rookie of the year.\nLuyendyk's win marked the lone victory for Lola at the Indianapolis 500 in the 1980s and 1990s. Lola returned to Indy car competition in 1983 with Mario Andretti, and quickly became a competitive chassis on the circuit. Despite the manufacturer's high level of success in the sport during that period, which saw six CART championships between 1984 and 1993, and saw them quickly displace March as the prominent customer chassis, Lola failed to win at Indianapolis again. The only previous victories to their credit at Indy were with Graham Hill in 1966 and with Al Unser Sr. in a modified Lola Chaparral in 1978. They would be upstaged numerous times by March, Penske and Reynard, until ceasing participation at the Indy 500 after 1996.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. A new era arrived at the network for 1990. Lou Palmer and the Speedway management parted ways. Bob Jenkins, a veteran on the crew as a turn reporter, as well as his work on ESPN, was named the new chief announcer and newest \"Voice of the 500\".\nBrian Hammons, who previously worked as a pit reporter on the ABC-TV crew, moved over to the radio network for 1990. Bob Lamey moved from turn two to the turn four position (vacated by Jenkins), and would remain there until 2000. For 1990, the reporting location in turn four was slightly shifted down the track, closer to the exit of the turn. Newcomer Gary Lee took over turn two, still positioned atop Turn Two Suites.\nLongtime broadcast member Ron Carrell, who debuted in 1965 and served as both a turn reporter and pit reporter over the years, would make his final appearance on the crew in 1990. Carrell would die at the age of 75 on the morning of the 2012 race.\nFor the second year in a row, Johnny Rutherford failed to qualify for the race. As he did in 1989, he joined the radio crew as \"driver expert\". Bob Forbes conducted the winner's interview in victory lane. One of the first noticeable changes Jenkins made to the broadcast was to eliminate commentary and reporting during the pre-race ceremonies. During the pre-race, the broadcast would instead simulcast the Speedway's public address system (Tom Carnegie, Jim Phillipe, John Totten, and Dave Calabro).\nLuke Walton, who was a longtime fixture of the radio network, had only served in a limited pre-race role from 1983 to 1988. He was not part of the crew in 1989 nor 1990. Three weeks after the 1990 race, on June 18, 1990, Walton died at the age of 83.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer, accompanied by Bobby Unser and Sam Posey. For the first time, the race was advertised as being broadcast in stereophonic sound.\nPit reporter Brian Hammons departed, and was replaced by Gary Gerould (who switched over from the radio network). Jack Arute and Dr. Jerry Punch returned.\nFor the second year in a row, the telecast would go on to win the Sports Emmy award for \"Outstanding Live Sports Special.\" For the first time, on board telemetry was featured in one of the cars (Teo Fabi). In addition, the first \"crew cam\" was mounted on the headset of a pit crew member (for the car of Emerson Fittipaldi). \n1989–90 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1989–90 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1989 and running through May 1990. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nArie Luyendyk, by virtue of winning the 1990 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1989–90 USAC Championship."

        "text": "The 73rd Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 28, 1989. The race was won by two-time Formula One World Drivers' Champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Fittipaldi's victory made him the first Indianapolis 500 winner from Brazil, the first foreign-born winner of the race since Mario Andretti in 1969, and the first non-American winner since Graham Hill in 1966. Though Fittipaldi started on the front row and dominated much of the race, he found himself running second in the waning laps. Michael Andretti passed Fittipaldi for the lead on lap 154, then led until his engine blew. Al Unser Jr. moved up to second, but trailed Fittipaldi by a big margin. Gambling on fuel mileage, Unser caught up to Fittipaldi after a fortuitous caution period on lap 181, and subsequently took the lead on lap 196.\nOn the 199th lap, Unser was leading Fittipaldi, at which time the two leaders encountered slower traffic. Down the backstretch, Unser and Fittipaldi weaved through the slower cars, then Fittipaldi dived underneath going into turn three. The two cars touched wheels, and Unser spun out, crashing into the outside retaining wall. Fittipaldi completed the final lap under caution behind the pace car to score his first of two Indy 500 victories. Unser was uninjured, and despite the crash, was still credited with second place. Fittipaldi received $1,001,600 in prize money, the first time an Indianapolis 500 winner received over one million dollars. \nAfter dominating the previous year's race, all three cars of the Penske team failed to finish the race in 1989. Danny Sullivan suffered a broken arm in a practice crash, and mechanical failures sidelined all three cars on race day. It was the only year in the decade of the 1980s, and the first time since 1976, that the Penske team failed to score a top five finish. However, Fittipaldi won the race in a Penske PC-18, which Patrick Racing had purchased from Penske.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1989 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. At season's end, Fittipaldi became the fourth driver since 1979 to win the Indy 500 and CART championship in the same season. The win was also Patrick Racing's third and final Indy victory. Former driver Chip Ganassi, who had become a co-owner at Patrick Racing in 1989, enjoyed his first of six Indy wins (as of 2022) as a car owner or co-owner.\nBackground and offseason.\nTrack improvements.\nSpeedway management resurfaced the entire track with asphalt during the summer of 1988, which would result in higher overall speeds for 1989. The last time the track had been repaved was in 1976. The apron at the bottom of the track (typically used for warm-up and cool-down laps, as well as an escape lane for slowing cars), which was previously known to be bumpy, relatively flat, and usually avoided by drivers, was also repaved. The racing surface was separated from the apron by a painted white line. The smooth and re-profiled apron was now tempting drivers to dip below the white line in practice and during the race. Drivers were starting to treat the apron as an extension of the track width. USAC announced penalties would be assessed for driving with four wheels below the white line excessively, other than to make routine passes in heavy traffic.\nThe rough and bumpy concrete pit lane was also paved over in asphalt and a guardrail was installed to protect the crew members in the sign board area. The newly paved pit area made egress and ingress to the pits smoother and safer, but also sharply increased entrance and exit speeds, potentially putting crew members at risk. Within a few years, after a succession of incidents on the Indy car circuit, as well as in NASCAR, pit road speed limits would be implemented to curtail excessive speeding through the pit lane. In addition the pneumatic jacks built into the cars were found to be embedding themselves into the soft asphalt of the pit lane. This necessitated crews to affix steel plates on the pit lane to accommodate the jacks (a practice that was also later deemed unsafe). In 1994, this would be finally be solved when the individual pit boxes were resurfaced in concrete.\nRule changes.\nGoodyear arrived at the track providing both a hard and soft compound tire. The exclusive tire provider spent the off-season developing new tires that were better-suited to the newly repaved track. Teams were permitted to run either compound at any time, however, they were required to start the race on the same tires that they used during time trials. All teams qualified on the soft compounds, thus all were required to start the race on soft compounds. Teams electing to switch to hard compound tires for the race could do so on their first pit stop.\nTeam and driver changes.\nTeam and driver changes were highlighted by Bobby Rahal's departure from Truesports. For 1989, Rahal switched to the Maurice Kranes Kraco Racing Team (A year later, the team would merge with Galles). Rahal, along with Arie Luyendyk at Dick Simon Racing, fielded the new Cosworth DFS \"short stroke\", and updated version of the mainstay DFV. However, Rahal's DFS engine blew during Carburetion Day practice, and for race day the team would have to revert to a previous generation DFX.\nRookie Scott Pruett, the IMSA GTO and SCCA Trans-Am champion, moved to the Indy car ranks, and took over the vacated seat at Truesports. The team would continue to field the Judd powerplant. After a noteworthy 6th-place performance in the 1988 race, Jim Crawford was back at King Racing.\nPatrick Racing was once again a one-car effort for 1989, after periodically running two cars in previous seasons. Pat Patrick had announced that he was planning to retire after the 1989 season, and Chip Ganassi joined the team as co-owner. After the season, Ganassi would take over the team and it would become Chip Ganassi Racing. As part of the arrangement, the Marlboro-sponsored Patrick Racing would run Penske chassis (PC-18), while Penske Racing would receive sponsorship money from Marlboro to run a third car for Al Unser Sr.\nNewman Haas Racing also made headlines, expanding to a two-car team for 1989. Mario Andretti was joined by his son Michael to form a two-car Andretti effort. It was also Michael's first opportunity to field the Chevrolet engine. Michael had previously driven for the Kraco Racing Team.\nAlfa Romeo joined the CART series with Alex Morales Motorsports in 1989. However, they were not yet ready to compete at Indianapolis. Their debut would actually come a couple weeks later at Detroit. As a result, driver Roberto Guerrero would miss the Indy 500 for the first time since he arrived as a rookie in 1984.\nAbsent from the race as a driver was Dick Simon, who retired at the end of the 1988 season. Simon had been a participant at Indy since 1970, but was still entered as owner of Dick Simon Racing.\nPractice – week 1.\nSaturday May 6.\nOpening day was Saturday May 6. Only eleven cars took to the track on a cold day, which saw snow flurries in the morning and the afternoon. Arie Luyendyk () led the speed chart for the day.\nSunday May 7.\nPractice picked up on Sunday May 7, with 44 cars taking to the track. Emerson Fittipaldi () set the fastest lap of practice thus far. Michael Andretti was also over .\nMonday May 8.\nRick Mears set an all-time unofficial track record at , the first ever practice lap over at the Speedway. His teammate Al Unser was close behind at .\nTuesday May 9.\nRain washed out practice.\nWednesday May 10.\nRookie Steve Butler crashed in turn 4, suffering a broken collarbone, sidelining him for the month. The speeds were slightly down from Monday, with Al Unser topping the chart at .\nThursday May 11.\nAt 4:11 p.m. on Thursday May 11, Danny Sullivan's car lost the engine cover, causing him to break into a 180° spin in turn three. The car hit the wall hard with the right side. Sullivan suffered a mild concussion and a fractured right arm. Sullivan would be forced to sit out the first weekend of time trials. High winds kept the speeds down, with Jim Crawford in a Buick V-6 () the best lap of the day.\nFriday May 12.\nRick Mears blistered the track on the final day of practice before time trials. His lap of was the fastest practice lap ever run at the Speedway. Jim Crawford and Al Unser also topped . Mears finished the week as the favorite for the pole position.\nTime trials – first weekend.\nSaturday May 13.\nPole day was scheduled for Saturday May 13. Rain, however, washed out the entire day. All time trial activities were postponed until Sunday.\nSunday May 14 – Pole day.\nOn Sunday May 14, pole day time trials were held. Per USAC rules at the time, the cars would be allowed one trip through the qualifying draw order, and the pole round would be concluded. Al Unser Sr. drew first in line, and was the first driver to make an attempt. Unser set a track record on all four laps, and put himself on the provisional pole position with a track record run of .\nA busy hour of qualifying saw several cars complete runs. Scott Brayton, Scott Pruett, Bernard Jourdain, Teo Fabi, and Michael Andretti were among those who completed runs. Bobby Rahal and A. J. Foyt followed, and the field was already filled to eleven cars by 1:30 p.m.\nAt 2 p.m., Mario Andretti () tentatively put himself third. The next car out, however, was pole favorite Rick Mears. Mears set a one-lap track record of , and a four-lap record of to secure the pole position. Minutes later, it was announced that Michael Andretti's car failed post-qualifying inspection. His run was disallowed as the car found to be 4.5 pounds underweight.\nWith Mears and Unser Sr. firmly holding the top two spots, the rest of the session focused on which driver would round out the front row in third starting position. Jim Crawford, in the Buick V-6, set a stock block track record of to sit in third at 2:40 p.m. Twenty minutes later, though, Emerson Fittipaldi took to the track, the final car eligible for the pole round. His run of put him on the outside of the front row, and bumped Crawford back to the inside of row two.\nAfter the pole position round was settled, the \"Second Day\" of time trials commenced at 3:15 p.m. Second day qualifiers would line up behind the first day qualifiers. Michael Andretti re-qualified at (the 8th fastest car in the field), but was forced to start 22nd as a second-day qualifier. Andretti complained he could not get to the proper level of turbocharger boost due a possibly malfunctioning pop-off valve, but USAC took no action. Tom Sneva had an impressive first lap of , but blew his engine before the run was completed. At the end of the day, the field was filled to 26 cars.\nPractice – week 2.\nPractice during the second week was light, with many qualified drivers practicing in back-up cars. Most of the focus was on the non-qualified drivers, and the recovery status of Danny Sullivan. The Penske Team started preparing a back-up machine for Sullivan, with Geoff Brabham selected to shake the car down.\nDanny Sullivan returned to the cockpit on Thursday May 18. He completed about 10-12 hot laps, with a top speed of . Jim Crawford crashed his already-qualified car in turn 3. A suspension piece broke as he entered the turn, and the car spun into the outside wall. The team would repair the machine.\nRain washed out practice on \"Fast\" Friday May 19, the third day overall lost during the month.\nTime trials – second weekend.\nThird Day time trials – Saturday May 20.\nOn the third day of time trials, Danny Sullivan qualified comfortably at . Sullivan was the fastest car of the day, followed by Kevin Cogan and Rocky Moran. Two crashes occurred during the day, involving Buddy Lazier and Steve Saleen. Neither would manage to qualify. At the end of the third day, the field was filled to 31 cars.\nBump Day time trials – Sunday May 21.\nOn Bump Day, much of the attention was focused on three-time Indy winner Johnny Rutherford, the biggest name who had not yet qualified. As the day opened, Billy Vukovich III () put his car in the field with an impressive run, ranked 16th-fastest overall. The second car to qualify was Johnny Rutherford, who completed his run at . The field was now filled to 33 cars. Davy Jones () was the slowest car in the field, and now on the bubble.\nJohn Paul Jr. bumped Davy Jones out of the field at 12:45 p.m. Paul was attempting to make a return to Indy after a four-year absence. His career was interrupted in 1986 when he was sentenced to five years in prison for his involvement in a drug trafficking ring with his father (John Paul Sr.) and subsequently refused to testify against him. He served a total of thirty months, being released in October 1988. Though tentatively in the field, Paul himself was now sitting on the bubble in 33rd at .\nThe track activity went quiet during the heat of the afternoon. At 3 p.m., Davy Jones returned to the track and bumped his way back into the field with a run at . That move put Phil Krueger () on the bubble. At 4:45 p.m., Pancho Carter bumped out Krueger. At that point, Johnny Rutherford () had now slipped down to the bubble spot.\nRutherford survived three attempts, and clung to the bubble spot nervously over the next hour. During that time, he put together a last-minute deal to step into a Foyt back-up car if necessary. He shook down the car with some practice laps, and appeared to be finding some speed. It was the second time in recent years that Rutherford was teaming up with Foyt on Bump Day. In 1984 Rutherford successfully bumped his way into the field with a Foyt backup car in the last ten minutes of time trials.\nWith fifteen minutes left in the day, Rich Vogler () bumped Johnny Rutherford from the field. Rutherford scrambled to get in line, and made it to the front with less than two minutes to spare. With the crowd cheering him on, at 5:58 p.m., Rutherford pulled out onto the track for one final attempt. He had a great warm-up lap of over , but just after he took the green flag, his engine blew in turn one. Seconds later, the 6 o'clock gun went off. Rutherford failed to make the field for only the second time in his career. Rookie Bernard Jourdain held on to the final bubble spot, and the field was set.\nStarting grid.\n' = Indianapolis 500 rookie, ' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner\nRace summary.\nStart.\nDuring one of the parade laps, veteran Gary Bettenhausen suffered a broken valve, and coasted to a stop on the mainstretch. He would be wheeled to the garage area without completing a single lap, and finished 33rd.\nAt the start, Emerson Fittipaldi jumped to the lead from the outside of the front row. He pulled out to a sizable lead over the first few laps. On the third lap, Kevin Cogan had a spectacular crash at the pit-entrance section of the front straightaway. His car made slight contact with the outside wall as he exited turn four, spun to the inside and made heavy contact with the inside pit wall. The car rebounded into the attenuating barrier at the pit entrance (also breaking the ABC Sports robo camera at the pit road entry), broke in two pieces, and slid on its side through the pits. The engine completely separated from the remains of the car and came to a stop in the pit area. Amazingly, Cogan climbed out unhurt.\nMid race.\nThe race was dominated by Emerson Fittipaldi for the first 400 miles. During that stretch, several contenders retired due to mechanical failures, including all three Penske machines. Top-five contenders Bobby Rahal, Jim Crawford, and Arie Luyendyk also dropped out of the race. Mario Andretti experienced electrical problems, which caused him to lose significant ground to the leader. Michael Andretti, who had started in the seventh row, had been chasing Fittipaldi the entire race and by the 150-lap mark, he was within sights of the leader. Meanwhile, Al Unser Jr. remained on the lead lap in third place, despite being lapped earlier in the race. By this point, the three leaders had significant distance on the fourth place car of Raul Boesel. With less than 100 miles to go, Michael Andretti passed Fittipaldi for the lead, but his engine expired a few laps later. Fittipaldi regained the lead, with Al Unser Jr. second. The remainder of the field ran at least six laps behind.\nA caution came out on lap 181 when Tero Palmroth lost a wheel in turn four. Leader Fittipaldi pitted for much-needed fuel, but he nearly stalled his engine as he pulled away. He lost several seconds on the stop, and was also blocked momentarily by a safety truck as he exited the pit area. Al Unser Jr. was running a distant second place, but the caution came partly to his advantage. On the previous rounds of pit stops, Unser Jr. had been experiencing slightly better fuel mileage than Fittipaldi. The team had been setting Unser up to potentially make it to the finish on one less pit stop than Fittipaldi. Under this late yellow, the team decided to gamble on track position, and Unser stayed out and did not to pit for fuel. Unser emerged just one car behind Fittipaldi. Team owner Rick Galles made the call not to pit – their fuel calculations were close enough that believed they could make it to the finish. Their reasoning was that even if Unser ran out of fuel on the final lap, they would still finish no worse than second since third place Raul Boesel was six laps behind.\nFinish.\nWhen the race restarted on lap 186, Fittipaldi quickly built a 3-second lead while Unser struggled to get around the lapped car of Raul Boesel (3rd place). Boesel's car was spewing fluid, and appeared ready to blow. After clearing Boesel, Unser began closing dramatically. By lap 193 he was directly behind Fittipaldi, and a lap later he nearly touched wheels with him as the two drivers worked around the lapped cars of Derek Daly and Mario Andretti and battled for the lead. On lap 196, Unser passed Fittipaldi for the lead in turn three and began to pull away. Unser's light fuel load made him much faster on the straights but there was still considerable fear he might run out of fuel short of the finish line.\nWith two laps to go, Unser approached a line of slower cars consisting of Rocky Moran, Ludwig Heimrath Jr., Bernard Jourdain and John Jones. The two leaders were able to get around Moran easily in turn one, but Unser was held up behind Heimrath through turn two, allowing Fittipaldi to close in rapidly. On the backstretch, Fittipaldi pulled inside Unser, who then cut to the inside to pass Heimrath. Both cars ran side-by-side down the backstretch, going 3-wide to pass Jourdain on the inside as they entered turn 3. Unser remained on the racing line, with Fittipaldi down low on the warm-up apron. Near the apex of the corner, Fittipaldi's car oversteered and drifted slightly up the track, and the two cars touched wheels. Unser spun and crashed hard into the turn three wall, while Fittipaldi recovered from the drift and continued on. The yellow flag came out for the last lap with Fittpaldi leading, cruising around on his way to certain victory.\nUnser emerged from his crashed car unhurt and stepped to the edge of the track to gesticulate at Fittipaldi as he drove by. According to Unser, at the last second he reconsidered and gave Fittipaldi a sporting thumbs-up instead, but some viewers interpreted his gesture as a mocking one. The pace car escorted the field around the final corner, and for the second year in a row, the race finished under caution. Emerson Fittipaldi took the checkered flag, his first of two Indy 500 victories. Despite the crash Unser was still credited with second place, having completed four more laps than Boesel in third. Boesel managed to nurse his failing motor to the checkered flag. The third place was his best Indy finish, and best finish to-date for Shierson Racing.\nFittipaldi's win was well-received by the Indy car community. Fittipaldi also spoke, in his native Portuguese, a greeting to the people in Brazil in victory lane, to the thunderous roars of the crowd. Al Unser Jr., after being checked out and released from the track hospital, congratulated his adversary on the win, and rejected theories that Fittipaldi intentionally crashed him in response to their previous year's tangle at the Meadowlands.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nQuotes.\n\"They're side-by-side, Emmo on the inside, Al covered traffic goes high, they touched wheels, Al Jr. hit into the wall hard, Emerson Fittipaldi keeps on going, they touched wheels, Al Jr. into the wall and Emerson Fittipaldi will lead them back to the yellow flag.\" – Larry Henry described the crash involving Al Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi on Lap 198 for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network.\n\"Fittipaldi comes inside Little Al! A drag race on the back side again. … Slower traffic moves to the right. … Can Fittipaldi get past? Little Al brings it down low. … They touch! Little Al into the wall, Fittipaldi continues on! Little Al slams the wall, as Emerson Fittipaldi screams toward the white flag!\" – Paul Page on ABC television.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Lou Palmer served as the chief announcer for the second and final time. It would be Palmer's 32nd and final 500 as part of the radio crew. Bob Forbes reported from victory lane.\nOne of the more significant changes involved Howdy Bell, now becoming the \"elder statesman\" of the crew. After many years in turn two, then one year as a pit reporter, Bell revived the backstretch reporting location. Bell was utilized sparingly, mostly for observations and brief commentary. The on-air \"Statistician\" duty was eliminated for 1989. This would be Bob Lamey's last year in turn two, and Bob Jenkins' final year as the radio reporter in turn four.\nThe biggest departure for 1989 was that of pit reporter Luke Walton, who had joined the crew in the mid-1950s. From 1983 to 1988, Walton reprised his traditional role of introducing the starting command during the pre-race ceremonies, but did not have an active role during the race itself. Pit reporter Gary Gerould took over the duty of introducing the starting command, but it would be the final time that was done on the radio broadcast. Starting in 1990, the radio would instead simulcast the public address system during the pre-race ceremonies. This was Gerould's last year on the radio broadcast. He would work the TV broadcast starting in 1990. In addition, Chuck Marlowe switched from pit reporter to the garage area duties.\nThree-time Indy winner Johnny Rutherford failed to qualify for the race, and joined the crew as \"driver expert.\" Since Rutherford never again qualified for the race (and subsequently retired in 1994), he went on to become a long-time fixture on the broadcast. The 1989 race began what would be a 14-year run for Rutherford as the resident \"driver expert.\"\nAfter the race, during the off-season, the Speedway and Lou Palmer parted ways. A new \"Voice of the 500\" would debut in 1990, along with many other changes.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. The 1989 race celebrated the 25th year of the Indy 500 on ABC. Paul Page served as host and play-by-play announcer, accompanied by Bobby Unser and Sam Posey. At the start of the race, Unser drove the pace car, and reported live from the car during the pace laps.\nPit reporters Jack Arute and Brian Hammons were joined by Dr. Jerry Punch, who appeared at Indy for the first time.\nThe telecast would go on to win the Sports Emmy award for \"Outstanding Live Sports Special.\"\n1988–89 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1988–89 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1988 and running through May 1989. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nEmerson Fittipaldi, by virtue of winning the 1989 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1988–89 USAC Championship."

        "text": "The 72nd Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday May 29, 1988. Team Penske dominated the month, sweeping the top three starting positions with Rick Mears winning the pole position, Danny Sullivan at the center of the front row, and Al Unser, Sr. on the outside. Mears set a new track record, becoming the first driver to break the 220 mph barrier in time trials. On race day, the Penske teammates proceeded to lead 192 of the 200 laps, with Rick Mears taking the checkered flag, his third-career Indy 500 victory. The race represented the milestone 50th victory in Championship car racing for owner Roger Penske and Penske Racing.\nThe victory was the first of six consecutive Indy 500 wins by the Chevy Indy V-8 engine, and seven consecutive overall by Ilmor-constructed powerplants. The victory also marked a triumphant return of success for the Penske chassis (in this case the PC-17), after dismal results in 1987 (PC-16), and sparse use in the previous four seasons.\nThe race was the third round of the 1988 CART PPG Indy Car World Series, and was sanctioned by USAC.\nBackground.\nDefending champion Al Unser Sr. returned to Penske to join a three-car effort with full-time drivers Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan. After a dismal go around with the PC-16 in 1987, Penske introduced the brand-new PC-17 ('88), with promise. Mears and Sullivan, respectively, won the pole positions for the first two races of the CART season. For the third year, Penske was fielding the Chevy Ilmor Indy V-8 engine.\nBack-to-back defending CART champion, and 1986 Indy winner Bobby Rahal returned for what would be his last season at Truesports. The team dropped the Cosworth DFX and they took up the development of the Judd AV engine. The engine was known to be down on horsepower, but excelled in fuel mileage and reliability, particularly in the 500-mile races.\nAmong the other changes included Al Unser Jr., who left Shierson after a winless 1987 campaign and re-joined Galles. Galles was now running the Ilmor Chevy engine, after running the Brabham-Honda and Buick in previous years. Raul Boesel took Unser's place in the #30 Domino's Pizza entry.\nDuring a tire test session at the Speedway in September 1987, Roberto Guerrero had a crash, and suffered a serious head injury that put him in a coma for seventeen days. After a lengthy recovery, Guerrero was back in the cockpit for 1988. Jim Crawford, who suffered serious leg injuries during time trials in 1987, also returned, signing with King Racing.\nBilly Vukovich III, son of Bill Vukovich II, and grandson of two-time winner Bill Vukovich, would become the first third-generation driver in Indy history.\nMany of the cars in the field were sporting new style wheels with flush discs, giving the 1988 month of May a unique visual appearance.\nAfter becoming famous for being \"first in line\" at the Indy 500 from 1950 to 1987, longtime fan Larry Bisceglia of Chicago, and later from Phoenix, fell ill and missed the 1988 race. With failing health, he died December 7, 1988.\nRule changes.\nStarting in 1988, teams were allowed to have six crew members over the wall during a pit stop. The crews would consist of four tire changers, a fueler, and a fuel vent/airhose man. Previously they were only allowed five (i.e., three tire changers). This was due in part to the fact that after the series changed from bias-ply tires to radials, the left-front tire (which at the time was seldom changed) would now be changed much more frequently.\nFor 1988, turbocharger \"boost\" pressure was reduced from 47 to 45 inHG. Stock-block engines were permitted 55 inHG.\nPractice - Week 1.\nRookie Orientation.\nSix drivers took part in rookie orientation. John Andretti led the group, putting in 220 laps with a top speed of 201.974 mph. After being denied entry five years ago, Harry Sauce returned to attempt the program once again.\nSaturday May 7.\nOpening day saw Raul Boesel first out on the track for Shierson. Dick Simon (211.665 mph) posted the best lap of the day, with less than 15 minutes to go in the session.\nSunday May 8.\nThe track closed about two hours early due to rain. Mario Andretti set the best lap of the day (210.970 mph), but did not eclipse Simon's speed from Saturday.\nMonday May 9.\nRick Mears turned the fastest lap of the month thus far at 213.118 mph. Two cars, Teo Fabi in the Porsche entry, and Ludwig Heimrath suffered mechanical/engine-related problems.\nTuesday May 10.\nRick Mears turned the fastest unofficial practice lap in Indy history, breaking the 220 mph for the first time. His lap of 220.048 mph was just a tick faster than Mario Andretti's lap of 219.995 mph.\nRoberto Guerrero was involved in the first crash of the week. He spun in turn one and tapped the outside wall. His car suffered damage to the rear wing. He was not injured.\nWednesday May 11.\nAfter two days of Mears topping the speed chart, Mario Andretti moved back into the top spot. His lap of 221.565 mph broke the day-old unofficial track record at 5:45 p.m.\nThursday May 12.\nLudwig Heimrath went high in turn 2 and brushed the outside wall, the second crash of the month. His car whipped around, and hit the wall again. He was not injured, and car had light damage.\nMario Andretti (219.084 mph) led the speed chart, with Scott Brayton second.\nFriday May 13.\nThe final day of practice was anticipated to be a duel between Rick Mears and Mario Andretti, the two drivers who had distanced themselves from the rest of the field. Mears and Andretti finished the day with identical laps at 221.465 mph to tie at the top of the speed chart. Danny Sullivan came in third-best with a lap of 218.446 mph.\nAndretti finished the week of practice with the fastest over speed, set on Wednesday. Mears was second, and the pair went into time trials as the favorites for the pole position.\nTime Trials - First weekend.\nPole day - Saturday May 14.\nOn pole day morning, Rick Mears blistered the track with a lap of 222.827 mph during the morning practice session. It was a new all-time unofficial track record. Mario Andretti (220.372 mph) was close behind with the second-fastest. Raul Boesel and Tom Bigelow suffered single-car crashes during the session.\nMario Andretti drew the coveted first qualifying attempt. After leading the speed charts in practice much of the week, his qualifying speed was inconsistent and disappointingly slow. His first lap of 217.014 mph was his fastest, but 4 mph slower than he practiced a day earlier. His final lap of 212.761 mph pulled his four-lap average down to 214.692 mph. He claims to have hit a patch of oil-dry in turn four, which was laid down earlier that morning due to Boesel's crash. \nAbout one hour into the session, Al Unser Sr. completed his attempt at 215.270 mph, good enough to take over the provisional pole position, and secure a spot on the front row. Derek Daly and Scott Brayton completed runs over 212 mph, and by 1 p.m., the field was filled to ten cars.\nAt 1:21 p.m., Danny Sullivan took to the track and on his second lap, he set a new one-lap track record of 217.749 mph. His four-lap average fell short of a record, but his speed of 216.214 mph took over the pole position for the moment. Not to be upstaged, Rick Mears took to the track at 2 p.m. His first lap of 220.453 mph was an all-time official track record, and he became the first driver to break the 220 mph barrier at Indy. His four-lap average of 219.198 mph secured him the coveted pole position. It was his then-record fourth Indy 500 pole.\nWith Penske cars Mears, Sullivan, and Unser, ranked 1st-2nd-3rd, the team had the opportunity to become the first team ever to sweep all three spots on the front row of the starting grid. After Mears' run, the track stayed mostly quiet due to the hot conditions. Several teams pulled out of line and elected to wait until the final hour.\nWith better conditions at 5 p.m., Arie Luyendyk put his car in the field at just over 213 mph. Al Unser Jr. was the last car with a realistic shot at the front row. Unser Jr. fell short, with a speed of 214.186 mph, good enough for 5th position.\nAt the end of the day, Bobby Rahal was among those not yet in the field. His first presentation to the line was aborted when the car would not crank. He waved off two attempts, the second attempt was averaging 212.8 mph after three laps. A. J. Foyt went out early, but debris on the track forced him to pull off. His second attempt was too slow, and he waved off.\nAt the end of the day, the field was filled to 19 cars.\nSecond day - Sunday May 15.\nAt hot 88 degree day kept cars off the track most of the afternoon. At about 5:30 p.m., Jim Crawford put his car in the field at 210.564 mph. Bobby Rahal was the only other qualifier, with a speed of 208.526 mph, slower than his speeds from Saturday.\nAt the close of the first weekend of time trials, there were 21 cars in the field. Among those not in the field yet were A. J. Foyt, Raul Boesel, Johnny Rutherford, and rookie John Andretti.\nPractice - Week 2.\nMonday May 16.\nRookie Harry Sauce spun in turn one during the final phase of his rookie test. The car was not damaged. Mario Andretti (216.398 mph) was the fastest of the day.\nTuesday May 17.\nGordon Johncock took to the track for his first shakedown laps of the month. Rookie Dominic Dobson completed his refresher test. Danny Sullivan (214.183 mph), was the fastest of the day.\nWednesday May 18.\nSpike Gehlhausen wrecked hard in turn 1, and was taken to the hospital. X-rays were negative, however, but he was out for the rest of the month. After struggling getting up to speed, Harry Sauce withdrew. Rookie Dale Coyne also announced he would not attempt to qualify. Pancho Carter (208.574 mph) was the fastest non-qualified driver, while Al Unser, Sr. (210.280 mph) was the fastest overall.\nThursday May 19.\nRaul Boesel (213.270 mph) topped the speed chart for the day. Rookie Scott Atchison wrecked in turn 4. he spent the night in the hospital, but was cleared to drive.\nFriday May 20.\nThe final full day of practice saw Pancho Carter (213.878 mph) and Raul Boesel (213.068 mph) lead the non-qualified drivers. Mario Andretti drove a back-up car to 212.314 mph.\nTime Trials - Second weekend.\nThird Day - Saturday May 21.\nNine cars completed qualifying runs, filling the field to 30 cars. Raul Boesel (211.058 mph) was the fastest of the day, with Dominic Dobson (210.096 mph) second fastest, and the fastest rookie. A. J. Foyt secured a starting position in his record 31st consecutive Indy 500.\nPancho Carter crashed twice during the day. On his final qualifying lap, he brushed the wall in the final turn, and slid and spun down the mainstretch. Later in the day, he wrecked his backup car in turn 2 during a practice run. He was uninjured.\nBilly Vukovich III, grandson of two-time winner Bill Vukovich, and son of race veteran Bill Vukovich II qualified with a solid run in the final hour. He became the first third-generation driver in Indy 500 history. As time expired, Steve Chassey made his third and final attempt, which was good enough to make the field.\nBump Day - Sunday May 22.\nThe final day of time trials opened with three positions left unfilled. Johnny Rutherford was the first car to make an attempt, and qualified comfortably at 208.442 mph. Later, Howdy Holmes and Stan Fox (driving Foyt backup car) filled the field to 33 cars. Scott Atchison (205.142 mph) was the first car on the bubble.\nAtchison survived three attempts, but Ludwig Heimrath finally bumped him out at 3:45 p.m. The move put Rich Vogler (206.463 mph) on the bubble. Ed Pimm made an attempt but wrecked, and Gordon Johncock waved off after a lap of only 206.049 mph. Vogler waited, and the team wheeled out a back-up car just in case.\nAfter crashing twice on Saturday, Pancho Carter's team purchased a back-up car from Hemelgarn Racing, but with practice time running out, they were having difficulty getting the car up to speed. Meanwhile, A. J. Foyt rolled another backup car out of the garage area. George Snider decided he did not want to qualify the car, and Foyt quickly consummated a deal with Johnny Parsons. Foyt shook the car down, and Parsons took it out for a practice run. At 5:29 p.m., he went high and smacked the wall in the northchute, ending his chances to qualify.\nAt 5:43 p.m., Gordon Johncock made his third and final attempt, this time bumping Vogler. However, Johncock himself was now on the bubble (206.693 mph) with less than ten minutes renaming. Rich Vogler quickly climbed into his backup car, and as time expired, bumped his way back into the field with a speed of 207.126 mph. Johncock was out, and Pancho Carter was left waiting in line.\nCarburetion Day - Thursday May 26.\nA total of 31 of the 33 qualified cars took to the track on the final practice session. Two of the alternates took laps, for a total of 33 cars on the track. A few cars experienced minor mechanical problems, but there were no accidents. Mario Andretti (215.105 mph) was the fastest car of the day. Penske teammates Danny Sullivan and pole-sitter Rick Mears were second and third.\nPenske Racing, with driver Danny Sullivan, won the Miller Pit Stop Contest.\nThe day before the race, Al Unser Jr. reportedly came down with a stomach flu or possibly food poisoning. However, he rested and planned to drive on race day.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nDanny Sullivan darted into the lead at the green flag, with Rick Mears in second. In turn two, Scott Brayton spun, collecting Roberto Guerrero, and both cars crashed into the outside wall. Tony Bettenhausen Jr., behind the incident, also crashed. On lap 6, the green flag came back out. Danny Sullivan got the jump on the start, and pulled out to a comfortable lead.\nThe top five would be Sullivan, Rick Mears, Al Unser Sr., Al Unser Jr., and Mario Andretti.\nFirst half.\nDuring the first sequence of pit stops, Tom Sneva crashed coming out of turn four on lap 34. Under the yellow, Teo Fabi, using the Porsche engine, pulled out of his pit stall with one of the rear wheels not secured. The wheel came off, and the car bottomed out, creating a terminal oil leak. Danny Sullivan continued to dominate in the lead, with Rick Mears falling to 10th place with handling problems. Al Unser Sr. and Al Unser Jr. continued to hold on to the top five, with Arie Luyendyk also lurking. Jim Crawford also began working his way into the top ten.\nThree additional single-car crashes occurred prior to the halfway point. A. J. Foyt wrecked coming out of turn two on lap 58, due to handling problems and slick conditions. On the ensuing restart on lap 64, Arie Luyendyk tagged Ludwig Heimrath Jr., sending Heimrath spinning and crashing out of turn four. Steve Chassey crashed in turn 4 on lap 81, suffering a concussion.\nBoth Mario Andretti (gearbox) and Al Unser Jr. (CV joint) came to the pits for long repairs. Both cars re-entered the race several laps down.\nAfter suffering early handling issues, Rick Mears radioed his crew and requested that they switch to the old style wheels. The car was not handling well with the new style flush disc wheels. The crew had to scramble back to the transporter to collect sets of older style wheels, and have all the tires re-mounted back in the garage area.\nOn lap 93, the caution came out for debris on the track. Rick Mears had just un-lapped himself, and got back on to the lead lap. Leader Danny Sullivan pitted, giving the lead for the first time to Jim Crawford in the Buick-powered machine. Crawford blistered the track for the next several laps, with a noticeably drastic racing line, dipping deep below the white line, and aggressive dicing through traffic.\nSecond half.\nAt lap 100, Jim Crawford led, with Rick Mears finally back up to second, Al Unser Sr. third, and now Danny Sullivan back to fourth. On lap 102, Sullivan's front wing adjusters broke, sending his car up into the outside wall in turn 1. After leading 92 laps, Sullivan was out, but Penske teammates Rick Mears and Al Unser Sr. were now in control.\nAfter a caution for debris (Unser ran over a rabbit), Rick Mears took the lead on lap 113.\nJohnny Rutherford crashed in turn 1, similar to Sullivan's crash. It would be Rutherford's final lap of Indy 500 competition (he would fail to qualify in subsequent years and officially retired in 1994). After trading positions, Rick Mears took over the lead for good on lap 129.\nWith Mears pulling away, the rest of the top three was being battled out amongst Al Unser Sr. and Jim Crawford. Emerson Fittipaldi worked his way up to the top five, as did Bobby Rahal in the Judd.\nAfter several long pit stops to repair gearbox problems, an oil leak, and electrical gremlins, Mario Andretti finally called it quits. With the leaders nearing lap 170, Mario was about 50 laps down with a dead engine. Mario was credited with 118 laps in 20th place.\nFinish.\nWith Rick Mears seemingly in control, the only battle that remained was for second place. Emerson Fittipaldi was running second, but he was deep in traffic. In the final twenty laps, USAC officials were contemplating issuing a two-lap penalty to Fittipaldi for allegedly passing a car under the yellow while exiting the pits on lap 164. Indecisive, USAC officials first penalized Fittipaldi, retracted the penalty, then re-instated it over a matter of minutes. This infuriated Fittipaldi and car owner Pat Patrick, who threated to file a protest once the race was over. Fittipaldi was dropped to 7th place, two laps down. The resulting scoring adjustments elevated Jim Crawford to second place, and Al Unser Sr. into third.\nOn lap 194, Jim Crawford got sideways in turn three, which flat-spotted his tires. He ducked into the pit area to change tires, but the crew had difficulty changing them, and he lost several seconds. He dropped back to 6th on the track. Suddenly Penske teammates Rick Mears and Al Unser Sr. were running 1st-2nd. Moments later, on lap 197 a piece of bodywork flew off of Michael Andretti's car. The yellow came out, and the safety crews rushed out to fetch the debris. However, the caution was extended when another piece of debris fell off one of the safety trucks. They were unable to clear the track before the white flag was displayed for the final lap. The race finished under caution with Rick Mears winning his third Indy 500. For the moment, Al Unser Sr. was second, Michael Andretti third, and Bobby Rahal worked all the way up to 4th in the Judd-powered entry.\nAfter the race, during the post-race scoring evaluation, Patrick Racing was prepared to protest Emerson Fittipaldi's two-lap penalty. USAC claimed that while exiting the pits, Fittipaldi passed the lapped car of Rich Vogler, and did not properly honor the blend-in rule. Fittipaldi claimed that Vogler waved him by as they exited turn two to the backstretch. When Vogler got word of Fittipaldi's penalty, he immediately rushed to the USAC officials and corroborated Fittipaldi's account. Vogler claimed that he was 8–10 laps down at the time and purposely waved Fittipaldi by, and that the penalty was \"unjust\". Under the rules, slower cars were permitted to wave other faster cars by during yellows, a move primarily used in order to not to impede the leaders. USAC re-evaluated the situation, and when official results were posted Monday morning, they retracted Fittipaldi's penalty once and for all. Fittipaldi's laps were reinstated, which elevated him to a second-place finish. Al Unser Sr. was officially third, denying Penske Racing of their first 1st-2nd Indy sweep. Jim Crawford's exciting day finished with a 6th place, the Buick V-6's best finish to-date.\nOne year after his best ever finish in the Indianapolis 500, Dick Simon rallied from a 16th starting spot to finish 9th in his final 500 as a driver. During the season finale weekend in Miami, Simon would announce his retirement from driving to concentrate running his race team.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. In September 1987, Paul Page left NBC Sports and joined ABC. As a result, Page left the IMS Radio Network, and vacated his position as \"Voice of the 500\". Veteran personality Lou Palmer, who debuted with the network in 1958, was elevated to the chief announcer position for 1988.\nOutside of Page's departure, a few changes were made to the crew for 1988. Pancho Carter, who failed to qualify for the race, served as \"driver expert\". Bob Lamey debuted on the crew, taking the Turn 2 location on top of the VIP Suites. Howdy Bell, who was previously in that spot, moved to the pit area and shared the north pits with Chuck Marlowe. Luke Walton covered the starting command during the pre-race, but did not have a role during the race itself.\nAfter the race, with Palmer now in the booth, Bob Forbes conducted the victory lane winner's interview. Sally Larvick (Paul Page's wife), who had worked on the crew from 1982 to 1987 in only a limited role (conducting interviews with celebrities, etc.), elevated to a full pit reporter starting in 1988.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on ABC Sports. Major changes were ushered in for 1988. Don Ohlmeyer was brought in as one of the directors, and a new style of the broadcast reflected Ohlmeyer's influence. The opening tease featured Alan Silvestri's score from the film \"The Delta Force\", in a medley with the instrumental song \"Katydid's Ditty\" by Mason Williams. The \"Delta Force\" intros (known as the \"Page Teases\"), narrated by Paul Page, would become a popular fixture of the ABC telecasts of the Indy 500, Brickyard 400, and other Indycar races, through 1998 and reprised again in 2001.\nWith Jim McKay departed, Paul Page served as both host and play-by-play announcer. Bobby Unser and Sam Posey returned as color commentators, and this three-man booth crew would cover the Indy 500 and other Indycar races on ABC through 1995.\nJack Arute and Brian Hammons served as pit reporters, the only time a crew of only two men covered the pits since going to a live broadcast.\nNew RaceCam angles debuted for 1988. Along with the \"over-the-shoulder\" camera, there were also cameras facing backwards from the cars, as well as a cockpit camera looking up at the driver.\n1987–88 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1987–88 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1987 and running through May 1988. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nRick Mears, by virtue of winning the 1988 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1987–88 USAC Championship."

        "text": "The 71st Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday May 24, 1987. After dominating practice, qualifying, and most of the race, leader Mario Andretti slowed with mechanical problems with only 23 laps to go. Five laps later, Al Unser Sr. assumed the lead, and won his record-tying fourth Indianapolis 500 victory. At age 47, just days short of his 48th birthday, Unser became the oldest winner of the Indy 500, a record that still stands as of 2023. During the month of May, an unusually high 25 crashes occurred during practice and qualifying, with one driver in particular, Jim Crawford, suffering serious leg injuries.\nAl Unser's victory is considered one of the biggest upsets in Indianapolis 500 history. Unser, whose driving career was beginning to wind down, had dropped down to part-time status a year earlier. He entered the 1987 month of May without a ride and without sponsorship money, which left him on the sidelines during the first week of practice. After Danny Ongais suffered a concussion in a practice crash, Unser was hired by Penske to fill the vacant seat. Unser proceeded to win the race with a year-old March 86C chassis, and the venerable Cosworth DFX, the powerplant's tenth consecutive Indy victory. Unser's car, originally entered as a back-up, had been sitting in a hotel lobby in Reading, Pennsylvania, as a show car just weeks prior.\nThe race was sanctioned by the United States Auto Club, and was included as part of the 1987 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. Of the notable statistics, the 1987 Indy 500 was the first such where the entry list did not include a single car built in the United States.\nDuring the race, a spectator was killed when an errant tire was hit into the grandstand, the first spectator fatality at the event in a racing-related incident since 1938.\nBackground.\nDefending Indy 500 winner Bobby Rahal went on to win the 1986 CART championship. During the offseason, his Truesports racing team made a highly publicized switch from the March chassis to the up-and-coming Lola chassis. Truesports, however, stayed with the proven Cosworth engine. Rahal was a strong favorite to repeat as winner.\nFor 1987, the Ilmor Chevrolet Indy V-8 expanded its participation in Indy car racing. Penske Racing fielded a three-car effort with the powerplant, while resuming its in-house chassis program. The PC-16 chassis was the primary car for the team, but as a backup, three one-year-old March 86C chassis were also entered. Newman/Haas Racing joined the Ilmor Chevrolet program, pairing the engine in a Lola. With it, Mario Andretti scored the engine's first victory a month earlier at Long Beach. Patrick Racing (Emerson Fittipaldi &amp; Kevin Cogan) was the third team to utilize the Ilmor Chevrolet, but they used the 1987 March chassis.\nRoberto Guerrero won the second race of the season, held at Phoenix. Guerrero was a rising star on the circuit, and the impressive victory from last starting position at Phoenix made him a favorite for Indy. For 1987, his Vince Granatelli Racing team was sporting a special paint job, a \"throwback\" day-glow orange which resembled the Andy Granatelli entries from the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nA new engine arrived at Indianapolis in 1987. The Judd AV V-8 was badged as the Brabham-Honda, and was fielded by Galles Racing. After part-time use during the 1986 CART season, the engine was utilized full-time beginning in 1987. Indy veteran Geoff Brabham, son of Jack Brabham (co-founder of Engine Developments Ltd.) and rookie Jeff MacPherson were the drivers.\nAt Penske Racing, Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan returned as the full-time entries. During the offseason, three-time Indy 500 winner (1970, 1971, 1978), and three-time national champion (1970, 1983, 1985) Al Unser Sr. retired from full-time driving duties. Unser had been driving for Penske from 1983 to 1986, and was still interested in driving part-time, particularly at Indianapolis and the other 500-mile races (Michigan and Pocono). Meanwhile, businessman and media mogul Ted Field arranged a deal with Roger Penske to field Indy veteran Danny Ongais in the third Penske entry. Al Unser was unable to secure a ride before the month of May, and arrived at the track unemployed, albeit shopping around for a competitive car.\nGoodyear arrived at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the first time with a new radial tire. After a few years of development in the CART series, the radials were ready for competition in the Indy 500.\nThe most noticeable construction project completed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for 1987 was a series of electronic dot matrix scoreboards installed around the track.\nPractice – week 1.\nSaturday May 2.\nPractice started on Opening Day, Saturday May 2. Rookie Ludwig Heimrath Jr. was the first car on the track. A somewhat light day of activity saw several drivers pass their rookie tests. Michael Andretti posted the fastest lap of the day, at . His father Mario, however, did not take any laps.\nSunday May 3.\nThe second day of practice saw increased activity. Mario Andretti posted the fastest lap of the day at . Later in the day, the weather cooled, and wind picked up. At 5:58 p.m., Pancho Carter suffered a spectacular crash. His car spun in turn three, air got underneath, and flipped upside-down. The car landed on the pavement on its roll bar, and proceeded to skid about through the North chute. The car hit the outside wall in turn four, and came to a rest still upside-down. Carter, however, was not seriously injured. His helmet had three major scrapes from rubbing along the pavement. Carter later proudly showed off the helmet, showing where he had rotated his head to spread the abrasion damage.\nMonday May 4.\nHigh winds kept the speeds down. Dennis Firestone and Roberto Guerrero tied for fast lap of the day (211.565 mph), while Mario Andretti was third.\nTuesday May 5.\nTuesday saw the fastest lap in Indy history to date. Mario Andretti blistered the track at an unofficial track record of . It made him the favorite for the pole position. The next fastest time, turned in by Bobby Rahal was a full slower. The second crash of the month occurred, involving Dennis Firestone. He spun and crashed in turn four, breaking bones in his left foot and fracturing his left leg, eventually this crash with a second crash would sideline him for the month.\nWednesday May 6.\nFour crashes occurred during practice on Wednesday. Kevin Cogan drifted high exiting turn 1, and crashed into the outside wall. Later, Scott Brayton hit the wall in turn four. Derek Daly and Dick Ferguson both brushed the wall in the south short chutes, but both nursed their cars back to the pits. None of the four drivers were seriously injured. Mario Andretti continued his dominance of practice, leading the speed charts again, at . A surprising second-fastest was Jim Crawford, driving a Buick-powered 1986 March to a lap of . Cogan, Brayton, and Daly were all driving 1987 March chassis. By mid-week, teams fielding the 1987 March chassis were finding the cars difficult to handle with the new Goodyear radial tires. Coupled with the warmer temperatures, and often windy conditions, many teams were finding the search for speed difficult.\nThursday May 7.\nBreezy conditions continued on Thursday. The most serious crash of the month to date occurred less than an hour into the day. Danny Ongais, driving the third Penske entry, crashed hard into the outside wall in turn 4. He suffered a concussion and was sidelined for the rest of the month. The crash added to the frustration the Penske team was having so far during the month. While they were having little trouble with the Ilmor Chevrolet engine, the PC-16 chassis was deemed a lemon. Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan were struggling to keep pace, and were rarely amongst the top ten each day on the speed chart. Meanwhile, Mario Andretti continued to top the speed chart, again by , with a lap at . Rocky Moran upped the crash tally for the week to eight, when he crashed exiting turn 2.\nLate in the afternoon of May 7, Penske Racing decided to park the PC-16 chassis in favor of their stable of 1986 Marches. However, none were presently at the track, nor immediately race ready. In some cases, they were serving as show cars. The first car would arrive the following morning, and Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan flipped a coin to see who would drive it. Mears won the toss.\n\"Fast\" Friday May 8.\nThe final day of practice before Pole Day was warm and windy. Mario Andretti led the speed chart once again (216.242 mph), but Bobby Rahal was a close second (215.568 mph). Four more crashes occurred, bringing the total for the month to twelve. Tom Sneva crashed exiting turn one. Dick Ferguson crashed for the second time, and suffered major damage. Gary Bettenhausen spun, and Phil Krueger suffered rear suspension damage after tagging the turn four wall.\nTime trials – weekend 1.\nPole day qualifying – Saturday May 9.\nDuring morning practice on Saturday May 9, Bobby Rahal led the speed chart at . Mario Andretti was second-fastest. Rick Mears, who only a day earlier stepped into a 1986 March, already had the car up to speed at . Stan Fox was involved in the 13th crash of the month, when he spun out of turn three and tapped the inside wall.\nHot, slick, and windy conditions were observed during pole day. Many teams who had struggled during the week with handling problems, sat idle on pole day, waiting for better track conditions. The first two cars waved off, and Rick Mears became the first car in the field at .\nBobby Rahal tentatively secured the top spot with a run of . Over the next hour and a half, five cars started runs, but all were waved off. By 1 p.m., there were still only two cars in the field.\nAt 1:09 p.m., Mario Andretti took to the track. Despite hot and slick conditions, and gusty winds, Andretti took the pole position with a speed of . Andretti's run was \"nerve-wracking\", inconsistent, and at times he lost traction, but the battle for the pole was settled. After Andretti's run, sparse activity took place until late in the day. Most teams stayed off the track altogether. Veteran drivers, Johnny Rutherford and Dick Simon managed successful runs, and filled the field to five cars.\nJim Crawford, a darkhorse favorite for the front row in a Buick entry, made his first attempt at 2:25 p.m. The crew waved off after a slower-than-expected speed. A little over an hour later, Crawford returned to the track. After a quick warm-up lap, he lost control in turn one, and hit the wall nose-first. He suffered severe injuries, fractures to both ankles, a fractured lower right shin, and a fractured left knee. He would be sidelined for an entire year. Johnny Parsons also brushed the wall in turn 2 during a practice run, upping the total to 15 accidents during the month.\nLate in the day, several veterans took to the track in an attempt to qualify. Among the fastest were Roberto Guerrero and Arie Luyendyk. Shortly after 5 p.m., A. J. Foyt qualified in 4th position, extending his streak to a record thirty consecutive Indy 500 races. With reluctance, Danny Sullivan completed a slow qualifying run in his PC-16/Chevrolet. It was a strategic move, in order to secure Sullivan a tentative spot in the field in case time trials were rained out on the second weekend.\nAt the close of pole day, only eleven cars had completed qualifying runs. With Andretti, Rahal, and Mears taking the top three spots, it was the first time since 1975 that the front row consisted of all former winners (and only the second time ever). With A. J. Foyt qualifying fourth, it was also the first time that former winners swept the top four positions. Rick Mears surprised observers by putting a year-old car (with only two days of shake-down practice) on the outside of the front row, his record seventh front row start. Veteran Dick Simon enjoyed his first start in the front two rows by qualifying 6th. The Ilmor-Chevy Indy V-8 engine won the qualifying battle, placing machines 1st and 3rd, while Cosworth's best car (Rahal) was 2nd.\nSecond day qualifying – Sunday May 10.\nThree more crashes occurred on Sunday May 10, lifting the total for the month to 18. The most serious by Tom Sneva, his second crash in three days.\nFormer winner Gordon Johncock was announced as the replacement for the injured Jim Crawford. Johncock initially retired before the 1985 race, but had tentative plans for a return in 1986. Johncock was expected to immediately begin practicing on the track.\nThe second day of time trials opened with two attempts, by rookie Ludwig Heimrath Jr. and Rich Vogler. Over an hour and half hour later, more cars lined up to qualify. By the end of the day, the field was filled to 18 cars, with Heimrath the fastest of the afternoon. Among those not yet in the field were Al Unser Jr., Tom Sneva, and Kevin Cogan.\nPractice – week 2.\nMonday May 11.\nGordon Johncock took to the track for his first stint of laps at speed. At night, the first significant rain in many days washed the track of some rubber buildup. Mario Andretti (211.714 mph) was the fastest car of the day.\nTuesday May 12.\nPenske Racing driver Danny Ongais was officially withdrawn from his entry. Following his crash on May 7, Ongais was diagnosed with a concussion, and was not medically cleared to drive. No replacement was yet announced, but Al Unser was rumored as the choice.\nTrack activity was leisurely, with Mario Andretti leading the speed chart at 212.916 in a back-up car. Rookie Fabrizio Barbazza was the fastest driver not yet qualified at 206.091. Dominic Dobson, another rookie, used the afternoon to finish the final phases of his rookie test.\nWednesday May 13.\nThree-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser Sr. was officially announced as the replacement for the injured Danny Ongais at Penske Racing. Unser took his first laps of the month, driving a newly arrived 1986 March/Cosworth. Unser had entered the month unemployed, and was at the track supporting his son Al Unser Jr. in his efforts at Doug Shierson Racing, all the while shopping around the garage area for a competitive ride for himself.\nAl Unser Jr. had been struggling to get his 1987 March/Cosworth up to speed during the first week of practice, and was unable to qualify during the first weekend of time trials. Unser Sr. had planned to go home to Albuquerque by Monday, if he had not yet secured a ride. But he decided to stay through the week to help his son Unser Jr. get his car up to speed. About a day later, he was approached to drive for Penske.\nAl Unser Sr.'s Penske Racing teammate Danny Sullivan started taking laps for the first time in a 1986 March chassis, powered by an Ilmor Chevrolet Indy V-8. Plans were being made to withdraw Sullivan's PC-16/Chevrolet from the qualified field, and re-qualify in the year-old March. Meanwhile, Penske was already prepping a third 1986 March for Unser, but his would be powered by a Cosworth engine.\nLate in the day Geoff Brabham broke a wheel, and slid into the wall in turn three. It was the 19th crash of the month.\nThursday May 14.\nAl Unser Jr., after two weeks of struggling with speed, led the non-qualified cars at . Mario Andretti continued to practice in his back-up car, posting the fourth-fastest speed of the day. Two single-car crashes by Johnny Parsons and Rick Miaskiewicz respectively, brought the total of the month to 21 crashes. Parsons suffered a broken ankle, and was sidelined for the rest of the month.\nFriday May 15.\nThe final regular day of practice took place on Friday May 15. Dennis Firestone suffered his second crash in a week, and 22nd overall for the month. In turn four, he slid into the outside wall, suffering a neck fracture and concussion. This would sideline him for the remainder of the month. Al Unser Jr. again led the non-qualified cars at .\nTime trials – weekend 2.\nThird day qualifying – Saturday May 16.\nThe third day of time trials took place on May 16. Several veteran drivers, as well as a couple rookies, completed qualifying runs. By the end of the day, the field was filled to 30 cars.\nAmong the veterans qualifying early on were Al Unser Jr., Gordon Johncock, and Al Unser Sr. Danny Sullivan withdrew his already-qualified PC-16/Chevrolet, and re-qualified with a 1986 March/Chevrolet. His qualifying speed increased by .\nLate in the afternoon, Kevin Cogan made the field, as well as Tony Bettehausen. After suffering two crashes during practice, Tom Sneva finally put a car in the field at over . Shortly thereafter, the track closed for the day.\nBump day qualifying – Sunday May 17.\nThe final day of qualifying was held on May 17. At the start of the day, three positions in the starting field were vacant. Steve Chassey was the first driver to attempt to qualify, but waved off after only one lap of . Chassey's car, a small single-car team, was entered by Lydia Laughrey, a rare female car owner.\nPancho Carter withdrew his qualified car, and re-qualified faster in a backup. Phil Krueger was the third car out on the track, and his first lap would have been fast enough to ultimately make the field. On his second lap, however, he dipped low in turn one, hit the outside wall, then spun and hit the wall again. It was the 24th crash of the month. After the crash, the track stayed mostly quiet until 4:45 p.m.\nSteve Chassey made his second attempt to qualify, but again waved off following three, slow, inconsistent laps. Rocky Moran was next, and despite only a average, he completed his run. Dominic Dobson and Davy Jones (driving for Foyt Racing) then filled the field to 33 cars. Jones in the process, became the fastest rookie qualifier in the field.\nWith 49 minutes to go before the 6 o'clock gun, George Snider took another Foyt back-up car and bumped out Rocky Moran. It was the fourth Foyt entry to qualify for the field. The move put rookie Dominic Dobson (201.240 mph) on the bubble. Dobson survived attempts by Ed Pimm and Rick Miaskiewicz, and at 5:30 p.m., still clung to the starting field.\nSteve Chassey made his third and final allotted attempt. At , he bumped his way into the field by just over 1 mph. Dobson was out, and Sammy Swindell (201.840 mph) was now on the bubble. Ed Pimm, after days of frustration, handling problems, and with the oil light flashing during his run, managed to bump Swindell out. That move dropped Chassey down to the bubble spot. Over the final twenty minutes, Chassey held on, and the field was set.\nCarburetion Day.\nOn Thursday May 21, the final scheduled practice session was held. The weather continued to be hot and dry. Two incidents during the session altered the grid for race day, bringing the total for the month to 25 crashes leading up to the race.\nAbout a half hour into the session, A. J. Foyt, who qualified 4th on the grid, got into turbulence in turn one. He lost control, did a half spin, and crashed hard into the wall. About an hour later, Emerson Fittipaldi, nursing an ill-handling car, spun and crashed in turn three.\nFoyt was uninjured, but was furious with himself after warning his rookie drivers about the difficult conditions, only to crash himself. Foyt's car was deemed repairable, and he was able to start in his qualified position. Fittipaldi's car, however, was a total loss, and he would be required to start a backup car on race day. He was moved from the 10th starting position to the rear of the field.\nMario Andretti continued his complete dominance of the month, and posted the fastest lap of the day. His speed of was over faster than Rick Mears, who was second-fastest. Likewise, Andretti marched closer towards a clean sweep for the month, guiding his Newman Haas team to a win in the Miller Indy Pit Stop Championship. He beat Bobby Rahal (Truesports racing) in the final round.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nRace day dawned warm with clear blue skies. During the pace lap, the car of George Snider caught fire, with a turbocharger failure. Snider pulled into the pits, as the rest of the field took the green flag. Mario Andretti charged from the pole position, and led the field into turn one.\nIn the first turn of the first lap, Josele Garza was down low on the white line, and lost the back end of the car. Right next to Al Unser, he started spinning. Unser slipped by cleanly, but reported being tagged gently from behind. Garza spun up the track, and collected Pancho Carter. Neither driver was injured, but both cars suffered damage.\nFirst half.\nOn lap 6, the green came back out, with Mario Andretti continuing to lead. Driving at a blistering pace, it took only seven laps for him to start lapping backmarkers. On lap 25, Ludwig Heimrath was running 7th, and made his first pit stop, but one of the wheels was not properly secured. The wheel came off, and he spun in turn four. Under the caution, Mario Andretti pitted, and managed to stay in the lead. Only seven cars remained on the lead lap.\nAround the mark, several cars were dropping out of contention. Kevin Cogan blew an engine, Randy Lewis dropped out with a gearbox failure, and Michael Andretti broke a CV joint, then had a pit fire. On lap 34, Bobby Rahal, who had been running as high as second, made an unscheduled, five-minute long pit stop due to an electrical problem. After several long stops, Rahal would eventually drop out.\nMario Andretti continued to dominate, giving up the lead temporarily only through the sequence of pit stops. Roberto Guerrero and Danny Sullivan consistently were chasing him. Shortly before the halfway point, Rick Mears was forced to the pits with an electrical problem, and would also be forced to drop out.\nAt the 90 lap mark, Al Unser Sr. had worked up to 4th, and Tom Sneva 5th. Unser had been lapped by Andretti early in the going. At that juncture, he elected to change his strategy and started charging up the standings. Andretti was still dominating, running laps in the low 200 mph range, while most other cars were in the 190 mph range, or slower. Dick Simon was running 7th, but ran the car out of fuel on the backstretch. He lost several laps as he was towed back to the pits, but received fuel, and returned to the track.\nSecond half.\nThe dominance by Mario Andretti continued in the second half, leading Roberto Guerrero by several seconds. The rest of the field was at least one lap down. Several of the other competitors were falling by the wayside, including A. J. Foyt (who was running 9th) and Rich Vogler. Sullivan and Unser Sr., both in the top 5, were now close to 2 laps down. Meanwhile, Tom Sneva and Arie Luyendyk, clinging to the top ten, both started losing ground to Fabrizio Barbazza.\nSpectator fatality.\nOn the 130th lap, Tony Bettenhausen started suffering a handling problem exiting turn two. Down the backstretch, his right-front wheel lug nut may have come off the car, and the wheel began to loosen. In turn three, the wheel came off and began rolling though the north short chute. Second place Roberto Guerrero came up on the wheel suddenly, and hit it with his nosecone. The nosecone cover was broken off, and the wheel was punted high into the air. The wheel cleared the catchfencing, and flew towards the \"K\" grandstand. Spectators were witnessed fleeing the seating in a \"V\" shape as the 18-pound wheel headed their direction. The wheel came down and struck 41-year-old Lyle Kurtenbach of Rothschild, Wisconsin in the head, sitting in the top row of the grandstand. He suffered massive head injuries, and was pronounced dead at Methodist Hospital shortly afterwards. The wheel bounded and came to rest in the tunnel underneath the north short chute.\nGuerrero slowed, and nursed his car back to the pits. Under the caution flag, the pit crew worked to replace the nosecone, and got Guerrero back on to the track, albeit a lap down. It was not immediately discovered at the time, but striking the tire had damaged the clutch slave cylinder, which was located in the nose. Fluid had begun to leak from the cylinder, which would ultimately render the clutch inoperable. At speed, use of the clutch was unnecessary, but exiting the pits would pose increasing difficulty.\nThe incident was reported live on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network by fourth turn reporter Bob Jenkins. The extent of injury was unknown at the time. The live ABC television broadcast, however, was at commercial when it occurred. During the commercial, the incident was noticed by the producers and commentators. When they returned on-air, however, footage of the incident was not shown, nor were specific details given of what had occurred. Instead, still images of Guerrero's nosecone and pit crew were shown. No further information was given during the remainder of the race. During the post-race coverage, Jim McKay briefly announced on-air that the Associated Press wire service was reporting that a spectator fatality had occurred, but he did not connect the incidents.\nLate race.\nWith 25 laps to go, Mario Andretti held a one-lap lead over second place Roberto Guerrero, and an almost two-lap lead over third place Al Unser Sr. The field had dwindled down to only 12 cars running, most of which were many laps down. With Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan both out of the race, Roger Penske took over the pit of Al Unser Sr. As Penske took over Unser's pit stall, Danny Sullivan and Rick Mears stood near Unser's pit stall to watch the race finish and pull for their teammate.\nAndretti, Guerrero, and Unser all needed one final fuel stop to make it to the finish. Unser Sr. made his final pit stop first. Roger Penske called Unser into the pits a few laps early, in an effort to \"put the pressure on Guerrero\" in hopes of moving up to second place.\nAndretti, leading by 1 lap, slowed down between turns 3 and 4, allowing Guerrero to pass him. At first it was believed that Andretti was ducking into the pits for his final pit stop. However, after leading 170 of 177 laps, Andretti suddenly slowed down the frontstretch on lap 177. An electrical failure in the fuel metering device, part of the fuel injection system, began flooding the engine with raw fuel. After the race, it was determined that Andretti had begun to back off to protect his lead. His lower revs developed a harmonic imbalance in the engine, which led to a broken valve spring.\nThe misfortune reinforced the perceived Andretti Curse. Andretti coasted around to the pit area, and the team immediately replaced the spark box and wastegate. Guerrero stormed into the lead, but still had one pit stop remaining. Sitting still in the pit area, the once dominating Andretti started slipping in the standings.\nFinish.\nWith twenty laps to go, Roberto Guerrero led second place Al Unser Sr. by almost a full lap. He came upon Unser Sr. in traffic, and decisively put him a lap down on lap 180. Two laps later, Guerrero went to the pits for his final fuel stop. With his clutch failing from the earlier incident, entering and exiting the pits was becoming increasingly difficult. Sometime during the race, Guerrero had also broken third gear. While stopped in the pit box, his car became stuck in gear. When refueling was complete, he attempted to pull out of the pits, but the engine stalled. Unser Sr. was driving through the turn three at the time. The crew refired the engine, and the car started to roll away. With Unser Sr. heading down the mainstretch, Guerrero's car stalled once again. The lifeless car sat on the pit road as Unser Sr. drove by to take the lead.\nGuerrero's frenzied crew ran out to the car and pulled it back to the pit. At that point, they simply tried to push start the car, which was successful. Guerrero finally got back on to the track, but by that time, Unser Sr. had put him a full lap down. Meanwhile, Mario Andretti's team had made some hasty repairs, and returned him to the track. After one slow lap, still being scored in the top 8, he returned to the pits for further repairs.\nGuerrero spent the next several laps furiously chasing Unser Sr. in an attempt to get his lap back. With 11 laps to go, Unser was slowing his pace as the third place car, rookie Fabrizio Barbazza was momentarily holding him back. Barbazza was trying to avoid going two laps down. Unser's crew asked officials to wave the \"blue flag\" to order Barbazza to pull over and allow Unser past. Officials waved the blue flag to Barbazza who refused to acknowledge. The issue became moot when Barbazza ducked into the pits for a late pit stop. With 9 laps to go, Guerrero unlapped himself. Meanwhile, Mario Andretti tried once again to get his car back up to speed.\nMario Andretti's second return to the track was also short-lived, and his car stalled. The car coasted to a stop in turn four and brought out the race's final caution on lap 192. The yellow flag bunched up the field, and allowed Guerrero to make up the rest of the lap; he lined up only six cars behind Unser Sr. The green flag came out with four laps to go, and Al Unser Sr. held off Roberto Guerrero by 4.496 seconds, to win his record-tying fourth Indianapolis 500 victory. By leading the final 18 laps, Unser Sr. tied the all-time record for most laps led in Indy 500 competition, and, at 47 years of age, also became the oldest winner of the 500.\nPost-race notes.\nMario Andretti's dominance of the month, and subsequent failure to achieve victory, was largely unprecedented in modern times. He led the practice speed chart on 11 of the 17 days (he participated in only 13 days), won the pole position, won the pit stop contest, had the fastest leading lap of the race, and led 170 of the first 177 laps. Despite not running at the finish, due to high attrition, Andretti was still credited with 9th place, his 8th top-10 finish at Indy.\nAl Unser Sr.'s victory in a year-old car was unusual in the CART era. Just weeks prior to being used in the race, the car had been sitting on display at a Sheraton hotel in Reading, Pennsylvania. The car went from Hertz sponsorship to Cummins after a couple of days. Due to time constraints, proper decals were unavailable in time for qualifying. Unser Sr.'s car was fitted with sentence case \"Cummins\" decals (the proper form of the company's logo) on the left sidepod - the side most visible, and the side used for most official photographs. All upper case \"CUMMINS\" decals (an improper rendition of the company's logo) were used on the right sidepod (the side least visible, and seldom photographed).\nIn post-race interviews, brothers Bobby Unser and Al Unser had a live conversation from the television broadcasting booth to victory circle, with Bobby congratulating his brother Al. It is believed to be the only time brothers were part of the victory lane interview. Bobby was seen in tears of joy as he watched his family celebrate in victory lane, from the broadcast booth. Bobby was in his first race broadcasting the Indy 500 on ABC television (the previous year he was part of the radio network crew).\nTwo nights before the race, at the Hulman Hundred, Al Unser Sr.'s nephew Robby Unser suffered a broken leg in a crash. Robby listened to the race on the radio at the hospital, while Robby's father Bobby Unser called the race live on ABC Sports.\nThis was the final Indy 500 for famous spectator Larry Bisceglia of Yuma. He traditionally was the first person in line since 1950, as well as 1948–1949 when he was one of the first in line. Bisceglia died on December 7, 1988.\nA little more than two months after the race, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway hosted the opening ceremonies for the Pan Am Games.\nBox Score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. This would be the final 500 that featured the familiar crew that worked the race from the mid-1970s to the late-1980s. Paul Page served as the chief announcer for the eleventh and final year (until 2014). It would be Page's fourteenth year overall as part of the network crew. Lou Palmer, who debuted in 1958, had become a fixture of the south pits and victory lane since 1963. The 1987 race would be the final time Palmer reported from the pit area, and the final time he conducted the victory lane winner's interview.\nParnelli Jones joined the crew as the \"driver expert.\" After only one year on the radio crew, Bobby Unser left to become a driver analyst for the ABC television crew. Luke Walton reprised his traditional duty of introducing the starting command during the pre-race; however, he did not have an active role during the race. With four pit reporters now part of the crew, Bob Forbes went back to exclusive duty covering the garage area and track hospital.\nLater in the year, Paul Page left NBC Sports and joined ABC in September. As a result, Page left the IMS Radio Network, and ultimately would be replaced as anchor by Lou Palmer for 1988.\nTelevision.\nABC Sports carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States for the first time on the scheduled race day. Jim McKay served as host, his 20th and final 500 on ABC. Jim Lampley served as announcer for the second and final time. Bobby Unser joined ABC starting in 1987, serving as color commentator alongside Sam Posey. Unser had been working CART series races on NBC (with anchor Paul Page) and had been part of the IMS Radio Network crew in 1986.\nThree pit reporters served on the crew: Jack Arute, Al Trautwig, and Jerry Gappens (the future CEO of New Hampshire Motor Speedway). The 1987 race was Gappens' lone appearance at Indy, and Trautwig's assignments primarily focused on features and interviews. The victory lane interview of race winner Al Unser Sr., conducted by Arute, featured a unique moment when Bobby Unser took over and conducted a brief interview with his brother.\nThe broadcast has re-aired numerous times on ESPN Classic since the mid-2000s.\nCART Standings following the race.\nNote: Only the top 10 are listed\n1986–87 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1986–87 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1986 and running through May 1987. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nAl Unser Sr., by virtue of winning the 1987 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1986–87 USAC Championship."

        "text": "The 70th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Saturday, May 31, 1986. After being rained out on May 25–26, the race was rescheduled for the following weekend. Bobby Rahal was the winner, becoming the first driver in Indy history to complete the in less than three hours. At an average speed of , it was the fastest 500-mile Indy car race to that point.\nNearly the entire race unfolded as a three-way battle between polesitter Rick Mears, Bobby Rahal, and Kevin Cogan. Cogan, who was a key fixture in the on the opening lap of the 1982 race, took the lead in dramatic fashion with 13 laps to go. Cogan, driving for Patrick Racing, appeared to be on his way to victory, and career redemption. But on lap 194, his lead evaporated when a spin by Arie Luyendyk brought out the caution flag. After a quick cleanup, the green flag came back out with two laps to go. Second place Bobby Rahal got the jump on the restart and grabbed the lead. Rahal pulled away and won the race, with car owner Jim Trueman, stricken with cancer, cheering him on in the pit area. Trueman died eleven days after the victory. At the time, it was the closest three-car finish in Indy history.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1986 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. For the first time, ABC Sports televised the race live \"flag-to-flag\" on network television in the United States. The race celebrated the 75th anniversary of the first 500, but there was very little fanfare of the milestone outside of the cover art of the official program.\nOffseason news.\nGarage area.\nThe highlight of offseason improvements at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was the construction of a new, state of the art garage area. Just days after the 1985 race, the old Gasoline Alley garage area, most of which had stood since the 1940s, was dismantled and demolished. Official groundbreaking for the new facility occurred on August 26, 1985. The new concrete garages increased to 96 units (up from 88), and each stall provided approximately 30% more working room than their predecessors. The green and white wooden barn doors were replaced with overhead steel garage doors, and the layout was changed from east–west to north–south. The access lanes were widened substantially, improving ingress and egress, improving drainage, and various vendor and support units were also part of the new complex. Lastly, a refueling complex was constructed in the southeast corner, including two underground tanks, one each for methanol and gasoline fuels. Most of the work was completed in April, however, some of the finishing touches were still being completed during the first week of on-track activity.\nThough the new garages were universally praised for their increased space and function, they were criticized for lack of aesthetics, and for breaking tradition. The plain precast concrete walls resembled the cookie-cutter stadiums of the era that were largely criticized in baseball and football. The design was a sharp and striking contrast to the previous garage complex, which led some to call them overtly plain or \"antiseptic.\" Changing the layout to north–south based was also a thinly-veiled attempt by the management to further scale back the oft-rowdy \"Snakepit\" area formerly located inside the turn one infield. The interiors were spacious and without walls (except those adjacent to the middle corridors), allowing teams the flexibility to erect partitions as they saw fit, as well as layout their work area however they desired. Lastly, the new complex greatly improved safety. The old wooden buildings were criticized as potential \"fire traps,\" and management did not want a repeat of the devastating 1941 fire. The concrete construction was more fire-resistant, water spigots were provided in every stall, and the wider lanes provided easier fire escape.\nVictory lane.\nA new victory lane area was constructed for the 1986 race. From 1971 to 1985, the winner drove up the checkerboard ramps into the \"horseshoe\" area below the Master Control Tower. A hydraulic platform was now used, which was located in the actual pit area, in line with the pit stalls. The car would drive onto the platform, and it would raise into the air, and then slowly spin 360° for the fans to see the winner.\nThis victory lane was popular, but could only a hold a small number of people when raised. It would be used through 1993.\nTelevision.\nOn August 19, 1985, after 15 years of being shown tape delayed, ABC Sports signed an initial three-year deal to cover the Indianapolis 500 live flag-to-flag starting in 1986. Longtime anchor Jim McKay was moved to the host position, and play-by-play would be handled by Jim Lampley and Sam Posey.\nThe Daytona 500 had been shown live flag-to-flag on CBS since 1979, and ABC officials had wanted to do the same for Indianapolis for several years. ABC's landmark telecast was scheduled to feature 32 cameras, three RaceCams, and an hour-long live pre-race.\nTeam and driver changes.\nDefending Indy 500 winner Danny Sullivan returned to Penske Racing, however, the rest of the team saw a shake-up from the previous year. Rick Mears returned to full-time driving. After his serious crash at Sanair in 1984, Mears only drove a partial schedule (ovals only) in 1985. Al Unser, Sr., who drove full-time for Penske in 1985, and won the 1985 CART championship, dropped to part-time. Unser would race only the three 500 milers (Indy, Michigan, and Pocono), along with Phoenix and Tamiami. Unser was assigned the duty of being the first driver to roll out the brand new PC-15/Ilmor Chevy Indy V-8 265A.\nKevin Cogan moved over from the Kraco Team to Patrick Racing. Cogan joined Emerson Fittipaldi to make the team a two-car effort. Fittipaldi's new livery for 1986 featured a new sponsor to the sport, Marlboro, which would become a big part of the sport for over two decades.\nBobby Rahal won three of the last six races of 1985, and finished third in the points. Despite a heavy crash at Michigan in August, and a testing crash in the fall at Indy, Rahal was hot off the finish of the 1985 season, returning with Truesports, and a favorite entering the season.\nBorg-Warner Trophy.\nFor the month of May 1986, the Borg-Warner Trophy celebrated its 50th anniversary sporting a new look, featuring a brand new three-row base. The likeness of the 1986 race winner was going to fill the body of the trophy, and the new base was constructed in order to accommodate winners through 2003. On the base, the first square was filled with a gold likeness of the late Speedway president Tony Hulman. The base increased the height of the trophy to 55 inches, and the weight to about 95 pounds.\nPractice and qualifying.\nPractice – week 1.\nPractice started on Opening Day, Saturday, May 3. Chip Ganassi earned the honor of first car on the track. Michael and Mario Andretti led the speed chart for the day, both over . On the second day of practice, the Andrettis continued their dominance, again posting the top two speeds.\nOn Tuesday, May 6, three single cars crashes marked the first incidents of the month. Danny Ongais, Herm Johnson, and Johnny Parsons all suffered single-car crashes in turn one, with Johnson's the most serious. Around 3:30 p.m., a piece of bodywork flew off Johnson's car in turn 1, which caused him to break into a hard spin. His car hit nearly head on into the retaining wall, and he suffered serious fractures to his feet and back.\nPenske teammates Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan nudged the speeds up over by Wednesday, May 7, then the day ended early due to a rain shower. On Thursday, May 8, Emerson Fittipaldi joined them as the third driver over .\nBy Friday, May 9, the last practice session before pole day, seven drivers were over , with Mears still the fastest of the month at . The only incident of the day was a suspension failure and spin by Johnny Rutherford, but no wall contact resulted.\nPole Day time trials.\nDuring the morning practice on Saturday, May 10, Rick Mears set an all-time unofficial track record, at . Later in the session, Michael Andretti and Bobby Rahal both broke the barrier. No incidents were reported.\nMario Andretti took the honor of first-in-the-field, with a qualifying run of . Three cars later, defending champion Danny Sullivan took the provisional pole position with a new track record of . The speed did not hold up long, as less than an hour later, Rick Mears blistered the track with a first lap of and a four lap average of . Mears' one- and four- lap track records would stand for two years.\nMichael Andretti squeezed himself into the front row, with a run of , faster than his father Mario. Emerson Fittipaldi ran 2 laps over , but a flat tire slowed his average to just over . Bobby Rahal managed one lap over , and qualified 4th.\nWith about 10 minutes to go, A. J. Foyt lined up to make an attempt, but his car failed technical inspection, and he was sidelined for the day. After qualifying was over, the cars of Raul Boesel and Dick Simon, both of the same team, were disqualified for faulty pop-off valve fitting.\nSecond day time trials.\nAfter missing out on a qualifying attempt on pole day, A. J. Foyt took to the track on Sunday, May 11 to qualify for his 29th career Indy 500. He posted the 5th fastest speed in the field, but since he was a second day qualifier, he lined up deep in the field.\nRaul Boesel re-qualified his machine, after being disqualified a day earlier. At the close of the day, the field was filled to 28 cars.\nPractice – week 2.\nRain delayed the opening of practice on Monday, May 12, and only 21 cars took laps Tuesday (May 13). Both days saw light activity, and the biggest news came off-the-track. Two-time winner Gordon Johncock planned to end a one-year retirement, and purchase a back-up car from Penske. However his funding fell through at the last minute, and he was forced to sit out the race.\nOn Tuesday, May 14, Mario Andretti was practicing his qualified car. A suspension piece failed, and he crashed hard into the turn 3 wall. Newman/Haas Racing would spend the next several days trying to make repairs, but the car's tub was rendered a total loss. Later in the week, Andretti started practicing his back-up car, which the team announced he would be driving on race day which unfortunately due to the rules would force Mario to start at the back of the field.\nThe remainder of the week saw sparse track activity. Most cars on the track belonged to yet-unqualified drivers. Thursday, May 15 was almost a complete wash out due to a thunderstorm.\nDay 3 time trials.\nDespite threatening weather for the next two days, the third day of qualifying saw only four additional cars added to the field. Jim Crawford was the fastest of the day, over . Dick Simon, who was disqualified the previous weekend, put his car back into the field with a speed of .\nThe day ended with 1 position left vacant in the field.\nBump Day time trials.\nAs many as 12 cars started the day with hopes to make the field on the final day of time trials. Rain kept the track closed until 3 p.m., with qualifying finally getting underway at 4 p.m. By late afternoon, however, several cars were pulled out of line and chose not to make an attempt.\nGeorge Snider went out first in an A. J. Foyt back-up car, and filled the field to 33 cars. That placed Dick Simon on the bubble as the slowest car in the field. After a wave-off by Steve Chassey, Gary Bettenhausen took to the track, found some much sought after speed, and bumped his way into the field with ease.\nWith Geoff Brabham on the bubble, and with rain approaching, Rick Miaskiewicz was the next car out. His first two laps were not nearly fast enough, and his team waved him off. That gave Derek Daly just enough time to get out on the track. His first two laps were fast enough to bump Brabham, but as he was completing his second lap, the skies poured rain, and the run was negated.\nGeoff Brabham held on as the slowest car in the field, while Dick Simon, the only car bumped, stood as the first alternate. Qualifying for the day lasted less than 45 minutes.\nCarburetion Day.\nOn Thursday, May 23, the final scheduled practice session was held. All 33 qualified cars except Phil Krueger took practice laps. At 11:43 a.m., a major crash occurred. A brake rotor on Dennis Firestone's car exploded, blowing his left rear tire. He spun wildly out of turn four, collecting the car of Roberto Moreno. Both cars spun into the inside wall, and Firestone slammed into the pit-entrance barrier, splitting the car in half. Moreno continued to spin through the pits, running into the back of George Snider's car, and crashing into the parked car of Josele Garza.\nNone of the drivers were seriously injured, however, Firestone's car was damaged beyond repair. The following day, Firestone's car was withdrawn from the field. George Snider and Roberto Moreno announced they would be driving back-up cars in the race. Both cars moved to the back of the grid joining Mario Andretti. After Firestone withdrew, the first alternate Dick Simon was awarded the 33rd starting position.\nRick Mears led the speed chart for the afternoon, with a hand-timed lap of . Later in the day, Penske Racing and driver Danny Sullivan won the annual Pit Stop Contest. Sullivan's team defeated the Truesports team (Bobby Rahal) in the final round to win the event for the second year in a row.\nRain delay.\nSunday, May 25.\nThe race was scheduled to be held Sunday, May 25. Despite a forecast of only a 15% chance of precipitation, race morning saw overcast skies and steady rain. Track drying efforts began around 10:45 a.m. EST. The track was close to dry, and spectators began filing into their seats. The cars were then wheeled to the pits, in preparations for a start. At 1:15 p.m., however, the rain resumed, and threatened to wash out the entire day. The rain stopped, and track drying efforts started a second time. The rain returned once more, and at 3:35 p.m., officials rescheduled the race for Monday. During the delay, ABC-TV diverted its programming for several minutes in favor of live coverage of Hands Across America.\nGrim memories of the tragic 1973 race were still in many people's minds, and all involved were determined to make certain the race would not be hastily put on in a rushed, last-minute, fashion. In addition, officials were uncommitted on how late they would permit a start, and if they would aim for a 101-lap race (the minimum distance for the event to be official), or insist on adequate time for a full 200-lap race before sunset. The weather forecast for Monday (80% chance of rain) was yet another concern.\nMonday, May 26.\nOn Monday, May 26, there was no chance to hold the race, as it rained all day. The infield turned into a sea of mud, and most of the spectators had since departed, going home to their jobs. Authorities estimated Monday's attendance at a paltry 5,800 spectators. Those who did arrive merely milled around, as most of the infield was impassable, concession stands were out of food, and souvenir tents were empty and abandoned. Some visited the Speedway museum.\nAt 3:20 p.m., officials announced that the race was going to be postponed, but did not yet announce the date or time to which it would be rescheduled. Unsubstantiated rumors even circulated about canceling the race outright. ABC television was scheduled to cover the race live for the first time, but did not commit to live coverage on Tuesday. Track officials were faced with the possibility of running the race on Tuesday in front of empty grandstands, and without live TV coverage. Weather forecasts for Tuesday and Wednesday were not promising, a substantial amount of the track staff was unavailable, and the sloppy conditions made parts of the facility impassable. Around 6 p.m. on Monday evening, a deal had been struck to reschedule the race for Saturday, May 31.\nMid-week.\nDuring the week, teams spent time resting and relaxing, while others prepared for the next race at Milwaukee. Track crews worked diligently to clean up the infield, and make it passable for Saturday. As a result of the postponement, a special thirty-minute practice session was arranged on Friday, May 30. Participants were held to a speed limit, and it served mostly as a leak check exercise. Some drivers, including polesitter Rick Mears, as well as Bobby Rahal, did not even participate. The five-day delay wound up being a popular choice by nearly all of the participants. It allowed them to rest and unwind, and regroup for race day without the uncertainty that was looming over them of when the race would start.\nFor the weekend, the Rex Mays 200 at Milwaukee, originally scheduled for Sunday June 1, was pushed back one week to accommodate the Indy rain delay. The 1986 race marked the first time since 1973 that the race was pushed to another day, and the first time since 1915 that 'not a single wheel had turned' all weekend because of rain. It also marked the first time since 1967 the race was held May 31; until 1971, when the race was always held on May 30, if that day was a Sunday, it was held the ensuing Monday, May 31. As of 2021, it is the most recent \"500\" to be held on May 31, and is the longest postponement in Indy from scheduled race day by weather in history. (The 2020 was postponed 12 weeks by restrictions from a global pandemic, but there were no weather-related postponements.)\nRace summary.\nStart.\nSaturday, May 31 saw sunny skies and temperatures in the low 80s. Traditional pre-race ceremonies were retooled slightly, with some replacement performers. The Purdue band was absent, while Robert McFarland, scheduled to sing \"Back Home Again in Indiana\", had departed and was replaced by John S. Davies, the artist-in-residence at the Indianapolis Opera. A smaller balloon spectacle was also hastily arranged, after all of the original balloons had lost their helium by Monday afternoon. An army band from Fort Benjamin Harrison was brought in to accompany the performances, and to perform \"Taps.\" Mary F. Hulman gave the starting command just minutes before 11 a.m., and the field pulled away for the parade and pace laps.\nOn the final pace lap, Tom Sneva veered off-course at the exit of turn 2. Further down the backstretch, a massive smoke bomb was set off by some unruly spectators. The yellow flag was displayed, and the start was waved off. The next time by, the field was red-flagged, and halted on the frontstretch. Sneva's crash was cleaned up, but it was determined that the field had burned an unnecessary four laps of fuel. A decision was made to replenish each of the 32 remaining cars' pitside fuel tanks with 3 gallons of methanol. The red flag wound up delaying the start by over a half-hour.\nAt 11:34 a.m., Tony George gave the command to restart the engines, and the field assembled for two pace laps. The field was straggling through the fourth turn to take the green, and Michael Andretti jumped into the lead from the outside of the front row. He set a new all-time record for the first lap at , the first time the opening lap was run over . After a postponement of six days, and after another half hour delay due to the Sneva crash, the race was finally underway.\nFirst half.\nAfter charging from the 30th starting position, Mario Andretti's day was short-lived. On the 15th lap, he brought out the yellow when he stalled in turn three with an ignition problem. Michael Andretti set the early pace, leading the first 42 laps. Mario later returned to the track, but his car lasted only four additional laps, and he finished 32nd.\nThe first half of the race saw record average speed, with only two yellows for 10 laps, and no major incidents. The second yellow on lap 52 came out for debris when Michael Andretti lost a mirror. Rick Mears came to the lead by lap 49, and held it until the next round of pit stops. On lap 83, Bobby Rahal took the lead for 19 laps, and led at the halfway point.\nSecond half.\nJohnny Parsons spun out of turn two on lap 102, and came to a stop along the inside wall. The car suffered minor damage, and Parsons was uninjured. After another long stretch of green, Rich Vogler crashed in turn three on lap 135.\nOn the 135th lap, Rahal (1st) and Cogan (2nd) pitted under caution. Rahal's crew nearly made a critical error, and did not change the left-front tire (it had not been changed yet in the race). Rahal had to pit once again the next time around to correct the oversight. Since the field was under caution, the consequences were not quite as serious, but he still fell from 1st to 4th.\nOn the restart, Rick Mears resumed as the leader. Short-pitting due to poor handling, 4th place Michael Andretti was the first of the leaders to pit again (on lap 163). Mears led all the way until his final scheduled pit stop on lap 165. Moments later Roberto Moreno brought out the caution by stalling in turn four. After Rahal and Cogan cycled through their final planned stops on lap 166, Mears again found himself up front. Michael Andretti (at the tail-end of the lead lap in 4th place) actually led the field behind the pace car as the field went back to green with 31 laps to go. Observers noted that the three leaders would have to complete the final 34 laps on one tank of fuel. Without another caution, it was feared that they might need a splash-and-go stop for fuel in order to make it to the finish.\nFinish.\nWith 14 laps to go, Rick Mears led Bobby Rahal and Kevin Cogan. Fourth place Michael Andretti was still clinging on to the tail-end of the lead lap, running just ahead of Mears. The leaders approached a string of slower cars, and Mears was experiencing handling difficulties in traffic. Mears got caught up behind a slower car, and Rahal pounced. Down the backstretch, Rahal got by Mears to take the lead and raced towards turn 3. Cogan made a daring pass around the outside of Mears in turn four to take place. Down the frontstretch, Rahal now found himself caught behind the slower car of Randy Lanier. Cogan diced back and forth, and slipped by Rahal going into turn one.\nWith less than 13 laps to go, Cogan was now in front. He opened up a three-second lead. Cogan's car was visibly loose in the turns, and on several occasions nearly clipped the outside wall in turn 2. Rahal was having trouble keeping up with the hard-charging Cogan, while Mears had slipped to third and appeared to be having some handling difficulties. With 7 laps to go, fourth place Michael Andretti ducked into the pit area for a splash of fuel. Suddenly on lap 194, Arie Luyendyk who was running 11th, spun exiting turn four. His car whipped around and lightly tagged the inside wall near the entrance of the pits. The yellow flag came out, and the field was bunched up behind the pace car. Cogan's lead was erased. There was some conjecture that the race could finish under yellow, with Cogan the certain winner. With the help of the yellow, the fuel concerns were now lessened.\nSafety crews were able to clear the incident quickly. Cogan led, with Rahal second, and Mears third, nose-to-tail on the track. With 2 laps to go, the lights on the pace car were turned off, signifying that the field was ready to go back to green. Cogan, Rahal, and Mears picked up the pace in the north chute, and came out of turn four for a restart with two laps to go. Rahal got the jump on Cogan out of turn four, and took the lead mid-way down the frontstretch. Rahal led at the line, and dove in front of Cogan going into turn one.\nDown the backstretch, Rahal pulled out to a 1-second lead. Mears set up to pass Cogan in turn three, but Cogan held off the challenge. Rahal took the white flag; his speed on the 199th lap was a noteworthy . Rahal pulled out to a 1.4-second advantage, and won his first Indianapolis 500. Cogan and Mears finished second and third, in what was the closest three-car finish at the time. Rahal's final lap was an all-time record , the fastest race lap to-date in Indy 500 competition.\nRahal completed the in 2 hours, 55 minutes, 43.470 seconds; becoming the first driver to complete the Indianapolis 500 in less than three hours. His average speed of 170.722 broke Rick Mears' 1984 record. Rahal later claimed that his fuel light had come on during the final lap, and a post-race inspection showed that only two gallons of methanol fuel remained in his tank.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nPost race.\nThe race celebration was emotional for the Truesports team, in that owner Jim Trueman was stricken with cancer. Visibly frail and lacking strength, he managed to arrive in victory lane to celebrate with his driver Bobby Rahal. Trueman was interviewed in victory lane by ABC-TV reporter Jack Arute, and took a swig of the traditional milk. According to Arute, Trueman was clinging to his shoulder, as he barely possessed the strength to stand on his own. After the cameras were turned off, he whispered to Arute \"I can go now\". Due to the rain delay, the traditional victory banquet was canceled. A makeshift victory luncheon was held in its place on Sunday June 1 at the Speedway Motel. The top three finishers were invited to the private reception. Later, Rahal's crew celebrated with a lunch at the nearby Red Lobster.\nThe city of Columbus held a victory celebration downtown on June 5. Over 300 Red Roof Inn employees took part in a parade down Broad Street. Trueman was too sick to attend. On June 11, Trueman succumbed to his illness, at the age of 51.\nRahal and the Truesports team rode the wave of success to five additional wins during the CART season, and clinched the 1986 CART championship. The team made it back-to-back titles by winning the 1987 CART championship as well.\nKevin Cogan suffered through his second major disappointment at Indy, following the misfortunes of 1982. Despite winning the season opener at Phoenix, he faded as a contender during the season. He also was asked several times, during the month of May, about his accident in 1982 with Andretti and Foyt, leading Cogan to reportedly exit a press conference early. Race winner Rahal, on Cogan's redemption story, remarked afterwards, \"1982 was a bum rap. The drivers treated him unfairly. He suffered through some rough times . . . I can't imagine what it must have been like to go to a race and have people boo you.\"(28)\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as the chief announcer for the tenth year. It was Page's thirteenth year overall as part of the network crew. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. Bobby Unser, Page's frequent booth partner on NBC Sports, joined the broadcast for the first and only time as \"driver expert.\"\nRon Carrell and Jerry Baker swapped places, with Carrell moving to the north pits (where he remained until 1990) and Baker moving to the high-profile Turn 1 location. Baker has remained in that location until 2017 (except 2010 and 2013 when it was vacant) as he would depart the crew and join the public address crew for 2018 when it was decided that Turn 1 would not be used in 2018 but due to a new broadcast booth debuting in 2019 named after Sid Collins, Turn 1's broadcasting location would be reinstated.. Gary Gerould (one of Page's NBC colleagues), made his first appearance as a pit reporter, sharing duties in the south pits with Lou Palmer.\nLuke Walton reprised his traditional duty of introducing the starting command during the pre-race, however, he did not have an active role during the race.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on live, flag-to-flag coverage for the first time. Jim McKay moved to the host position, while Jim Lampley served as announcer.\nThe initial live broadcast set for Sunday, May 25 was rained out. The telecast was filled with interviews, talk, and highlights of previous races. The broadcast returned on Saturday, May 31 for the live coverage of the race.\nThree pit reporters served on the crew, joined by Donna de Varona, who was slated to serve as a roving reporter, conducting interviews and other features. However, she appeared only on the original Sunday telecast, and did not return on Saturday. Dr. Joe Randolph was also announced as part of the team, slated to report from the medical center, but he never appears on-air.\nThree RaceCams were used (none were utilized in 1985), with defending champion Danny Sullivan the highest-profile driver to feature one. For the first time, the broadcast carried all of the pre-race ceremonies live, although they omitted coverage of the invocation.\nThe broadcast has re-aired numerous times on ESPN Classic since the mid-2000s.\n1985–86 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1985–86 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1985 and running through May 1986. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the \"de facto\" Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\nBobby Rahal, by virtue of winning the 1986 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1985–86 USAC Championship.\nQuotes.\nPaul Page described the finish of IMS Radio Network:\nKevin Cogan responding to Sam Posey for an in-race radio interview with only 3 laps to go:\nSam Posey on ABC-TV after being snubbed by Kevin Cogan:\nNotes.\nReferences.\n28.

        "text": "The 69th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday, May 26, 1985. The race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1985 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. The Speedway also celebrated 40 years of ownership by the Hulman/George family.\nIn one of the most dramatic moments in Indy 500 history, Danny Sullivan took the lead from Mario Andretti on lap 120. But as he was completing the pass, Sullivan's car stepped out, and he lost control. He spun directly in front of Andretti in turn one, doing a complete 360°. Andretti veered to the inside and slipped by unscathed, while Sullivan's car somehow avoided contact with the concrete wall. Sullivan remarkably gathered control without stalling the engine, and continued in the race. About twenty laps later, Sullivan managed to re-pass Andretti for the lead, this time cleanly. Sullivan led the final 61 laps, and scored his first and only Indy victory. It was the fifth Indy win for car owner Roger Penske (Penske Racing), tying the record at the time held by Lou Moore.\nDue to the electrifying spin by Sullivan, and the subsequent recovery, the race became known in auto racing lore as the \"Spin and Win\". It is largely considered one of the most famous moments in all of Indy car racing history.\nThe 1985 Indy 500 was the breakout race for the \"stock block\" Buick Indy V6 engine. Pancho Carter and Scott Brayton swept the top two spots on the starting grid with the pushrod Buick, setting new track record speeds in time trials. However, both cars still had questionable reliability for the full 500 miles, and both dropped out early with mechanical problems on race day.\nBackground.\nDefending Indy winner Rick Mears suffered serious leg injuries in a crash at Sanair Super Speedway in August 1984. He missed the rest of the 1984 season, and would run only a part-time schedule in 1985. The 1985 Indy 500 was his first race back after recovery. Danny Sullivan joined Penske Racing for 1985. Al Unser Sr., who was filling in for Mears during the rest of the season, took the wheel of a third Penske entry for Indy.\nWilly T. Ribbs entered the Rookie Orientation Program in April, hoping to become the first African American driver to qualify for the Indy 500. However, after 20 laps of testing, he managed only 172 mph, and withdrew, citing his inexperience. He would return in 1991.\nThis would be the final Indy 500 broadcast on television in tape delay. Later in the summer, ABC-TV signed a deal to broadcast the Indy 500 live for the first time starting in 1986. It would also be Jim McKay's final Indy 500 as play-by-play anchor.\nA. J. Foyt announced during the month he was planning to retire after the 1987 race, which would be his 30th start. The decision was later retracted. Foyt entered the month of May 1985 with the opportunity to pass the 10,000 mile mark in competition at Indy, and the race would mark his record 300th career Indy car start.\nAt the conclusion of the race, the Speedway planned to tear down the legendary Gasoline Alley garage area, in preparations for construction of a new, modern garage facility. This would be the final Indy 500 field to utilize the famous landmark green and white \"barn-like\" garages.\nTime trials.\nPole Day – Saturday May 11.\nPole day was sunny and warm, with temperatures in the low 80s. Mario Andretti (214.285 mph) and Bobby Rahal (214.183 mph) were the fastest cars in practice, and were early favorites for the pole position.\nQualifying began promptly at 11 a.m. The first car to take to the track was Scott Brayton in one of the Buick V-6 stock block engines. He set new one and four-lap track records, as well as track records for stock block engines. His four-lap average of 212.354 mph tentatively put him on pole position.\nBrayton's final lap dropped off due to transmission trouble. Not to be upstaged, less than twenty minutes later, Pancho Carter took to the track, also driving a Buick V-6.\nCarter could not eclipse Brayton's one-lap track record, but his run was more consistent. Carter's four-lap average of 212.533 mph was faster overall than Brayton, and itself was a new four-lap track record. Carter took the top spot by a mere 0.177 seconds. As a result, in a mostly rare situation, the one-lap and four-lap track records were thus held by two different drivers. Carter clinched the pole position, and completed a 1st–2nd sweep for the Buicks on the starting grid. Only a half-hour had passed, but the Buicks had already established their dominance of time trials, and distanced themselves from the rest of the competition. After the record-setting run, Brayton picked up the sponsorship of Hardee's during the week.\nWith the pole position basically out-of-reach, the rest of the field battled out to see who would fill out the front row. Emerson Fittipaldi (211.322 mph) put himself tentatively in third position, but Mario Andretti (211.576 mph) later bumped him off the front row. At 1:13 p.m., Bobby Rahal, the last driver with a legitimate shot, turned in a run of 211.818 mph, securing the outside of the front row.\nA busy day saw 27 cars qualify. Rick Mears returned from his 1984 leg injuries to qualify 10th. Danny Sullivan put his car in the field in 8th. No driver from 1911 to 1984 had ever won the race from 8th starting position, and it was often nicknamed the dreaded \"8-ball spot\".\nSecond Day – Sunday May 12.\nOnly two cars, Steve Chassey and Chet Fillip, made qualifying attempts, both late in the day. At the end of the first weekend of time trials, the field was filled to 29 cars.\nThird Day – Saturday May 18.\nThe second weekend of time trials saw cooler weather, and better conditions. Rookie Raul Boesel was the first car to take to the track, and put in a solid run of 206.498 mph.\nLate in the day, George Snider continued the trend of stock block engines, putting a Foyt V-6 in the field. In doing so, the field was filled to 33 cars. John Paul Jr. squeezed in a qualifying run between his IMSA commitments, and bumped Derek Daly from the field.\nTony Bettenhausen Jr. bumped out Chet Fillip, who earlier in the day, had wrecked his back-up car, leaving him on the sidelines for the rest of the month. The day ended as Jim Crawford bumped out Kevin Cogan.\nBump Day – Sunday May 19.\nThe final day of time trials opened with Steve Chassey on the bubble, and about nine cars looking to make the field. Kevin Cogan got in his backup car, and easily bumped his way back into the field to open the afternoon. After Cogan's run, the track went mostly quiet, as drivers awaited better conditions.\nThree-time winner Johnny Rutherford was now on the bubble, the second year in a row he was in danger of not qualifying. At about 5 p.m., Derek Daly (207.548 mph) bumped out Rutherford. A few minutes later, Rutherford got in a backup car, and at 208.254 mph, easily put himself back in the field. Rutherford bumped out Michael Roe in the process.\nWith a half hour left in the day, Pete Halsmer was on the bubble. He survived an attempt by Tom Bigelow, but Rich Vogler succeeded in bumping him out. Tony Bettenhausen Jr. (204.824 mph) was now on the bubble. Michael Roe tried twice to bump him out, but fell short on both attempts.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nGoing into the race, the top two qualifiers, Pancho Carter and Scott Brayton were considered underdogs, due to reliability issues with the Buick engine. Mario Andretti emerged as the race day favorite.\nRace day dawned sunny and warm. Mary F. Hulman gave the command to start engines just before 11 a.m., and the field pulled away for the pace laps. At the green flag, Bobby Rahal got the jump from the outside of the front row, and took the lead into turn 1. Brayton settled into second, but polesitter Carter slipped back to fourth. By turn three, Mario Andretti had picked off Brayton for second, and Rahal went on to lead the first lap.\nIn the first few laps, Carter slid down the standings, and on lap 6, he pulled into the pits with a failed oil pump. He became the second polesitter to finish last (33rd) after Cliff Woodbury in 1929.\nBobby Rahal led the first 14 laps. On lap 15, George Snider and Josele Garza both suffered blown engine, bringing out the first caution. Mario Andretti had a faster pit stop, and emerged on the track as the new leader on lap 16.\nFirst half.\nThe Buicks' day came to an end on lap 19 when Scott Brayton stopped on the track with a blown engine from a cracked cylinder wall. After keeping a close margin to Andretti, Bobby Rahal went to the pits on lap 52 with a turbocharger wastegate problem. After several long pit stops, Rahal eventually dropped out with 84 laps.\nMario Andretti continued to dominate, with Danny Sullivan now in second. Also, high in contention was Emerson Fittipaldi, Al Unser Jr. and Al Unser, Sr.\nOn lap 61, A. J. Foyt came into the pits with a poor-handling car in 20th place. After a heated exchange with his crew, it was determined that the front wing was broken. An angry Foyt stormed around the car, bumped into the fueler, fuel spilled, and fire started in the pit area. The fire was quickly doused. Foyt was out of the race just one lap short of the 10,000-mile career mark at the Speedway. Al Unser, Sr. was penalized for running over his air hose, which dropped him down the standings, Al Unser Jr., who was in the top five, dropped out on lap 91 with an engine failure.\nSecond half.\nAt the halfway point, only four cars remained on the lead lap. In order, they were Mario Andretti, Emerson Fittipaldi, Tom Sneva, and Danny Sullivan. After green flag pit stops, Sullivan moved into 2nd place by being the only driver among them to take a fuel-only stop.\nDanny Sullivan spin.\nShortly after the halfway point, Danny Sullivan got a radio call from his crew, but he misunderstood the message. He thought they said there were only 12 laps to go. In reality, there were still over 80 laps remaining. Sullivan quickly turned up the turbocharger boost, and started closing in on Andretti for the lead. On lap 120, Sullivan pulled to the inside down the front stretch, and took the lead going into turn one. Andretti held his ground, forcing Sullivan to make the pass down below the yellow line in the somewhat rough and flat apron. Suddenly, the car slipped as Sullivan came off the apron, and the back end snapped loose. Out of control, Sullivan's car began a counterclockwise 360° spin directly in front of Andretti in the south short chute. Andretti pinched his car down to the inside, and slipped by unscathed. Meanwhile, Sullivan spun completely around, did not hit anything, and the engine stalled for an instant. When the tire smoked cleared, Sullivan noticed he was pointing in the correct direction, and he put the car in gear. The engine caught, and Sullivan pulled away under power to resume the race.\nThe spin was immediately considered one of the most electrifying moments in Indy history, both for Andretti's ability to avoid Sullivan's spinning car, and for Sullivan's recovery from the spin. Sullivan considered it 50/50 skill and \"dumb luck\" that he emerged from the spin unscathed. Andretti's split-second decision to veer to the inside (the more difficult move, pinching his own car down) was a result of his experience from a very similar incident two years earlier. In the 1983 race, Andretti was faced with a nearly identical situation when Johnny Parsons spun in front of him coming out of turn one. Andretti was forced to try to avoid Parsons' car to the outside, the two cars collided, and Andretti crashed hard into the concrete wall.\nThe yellow flag immediately came out, and both Sullivan and Andretti made pit stops for tires and fuel. Their stops briefly put Emerson Fittipaldi into the lead, until he too stopped under caution. This left Andretti back in the lead, with Tom Sneva second and Sullivan third. Several lapped cars began ahead of the race leaders on the restart. Going into turn 1 on lap 124, Howdy Holmes drifted down into the rear quarter of Rich Vogler. Vogler was sent hard into the wall, skidding in front of the leaders. Andretti avoided the wreck, but Sneva locked his brakes and spun wide in front of Sullivan, who slipped by unscathed. Sneva hit the wall, but was not injured. Vogler, with a concussion and two cuts above his eyelid, was airlifted to Methodist Hospital for further treatment.\nAfter the cleanup, the race again reverted to Mario Andretti leading and Danny Sullivan second. On lap 140, Sullivan tried for the second time to get by Andretti, in exactly the same place as 20 laps before. This time he made the pass cleanly and started to pull away.\nDanny Sullivan started to pull away at will in the final 50 laps. Mario Andretti was starting to struggle, and was passed by Emerson Fittipaldi for second place for several laps.\nFinish.\nMario Andretti caught a break on lap 175 when John Paul Jr. crashed in turn 2. Paul lost a wheel, and spun nearly head-on into the outside wall near the Turn Two Suites. He was not seriously injured. Andretti, meanwhile, bunched up behind Sullivan, and made the race close over the final laps.\nAfter being a factor nearly all afternoon, Emerson Fittipaldi dropped out of the race with low oil pressure and a broken fuel line with only 12 laps to go.\nOn lap 192, Bill Whittington crashed in turn 3. The crash set up a restart with three laps to go. Andretti lined up three cars behind Sullivan, and as the green came out, he was able to quickly pick off both lapped cars. With two laps to go, Sullivan had a comfortable 2.4-second lead. Andretti was not able to close the gap, and Sullivan won his first (and only) Indy 500 by 2.477 seconds over Mario Andretti.\nAndretti matched his best finish in the race besides his win in 1969. Andretti was disappointed in an interview stating: \"Second sucks. This was my best chance to win since my 1969 victory. We got a lot out of the car but it was not good enough. I left Danny plenty of room down on the apron and he just spun out. I picked the way to go and it happened to have been the right way. I knew he was cooked when he went down the apron but...he was just lucky that's all.\"\nOn his victory, Sullivan later stated in 1995:\n\"Mario and I are best friends, but he was so annoyed by the defeat that he didn't talk to me for a year. He would high-five anybody but me for several months. It annoyed him because he felt like he had it won. I had probably the best car of the field and so did he but ultimately I came out on top.\"\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nLegacy.\nThe \"Spin and Win\" result went down in Indy 500 lore as one of the most famous moments in the history of the race. Mario Andretti considered the 1985 race his \"best chance to win,\" and his subsequent failure added to the Andretti curse. A disappointed Andretti refused to speak with Sullivan for almost a year after the race. In post-race interviews, the experienced Andretti claimed he baited the younger Sullivan during the pass, and deliberately pinched him down to the apron.\nSam Posey reflected the win as a \"changing of the guard\" on the Indy car circuit, as the young 'hot-shot' Sullivan beat the established and long-experienced Andretti. Likewise, Indy legend A. J. Foyt was not a factor, and Johnny Rutherford, despite a strong finish, struggled to qualify.\nThe victory thrust Danny Sullivan into superstar status on the CART circuit. He guest-starred on an episode of \"Miami Vice\" () as well as a soap opera. He would go on to finish 4th in the 1985 points standings, and would win a CART championship in 1988.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as the chief announcer for the ninth year. It was Page's twelfth year overall as part of the network crew. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. The 1985 broadcast marked the final time the network featured exclusive live coverage of the race. The following year, ABC Sports would begin covering the race live on network television. Thus, Palmer's live interview with the winner in 1985 was the final time the network was granted exclusive live access to the winner's first interview in victory lane. Veteran Luke Walton introduced the starting command during the pre-race, but did not report during the race itself.\nGordon Johncock, who abruptly retired from driving during the month, joined Rodger Ward and the broadcast featured two driver experts. In addition, the reporting location on the backstretch was eliminated, due to the increasing speed of the cars, and the fact that the Turn 2 and Turn 3 reporters had a sufficient view of the straightaway. Bob Forbes spent the first segments of the race reporting from the center pits, then in the second half of the race, concentrated on the garage area and hospital.\nDoug Zink, who had joined the network in 1966, left the crew. Howdy Bell took over Zink's vacant spot in turn 2, which was also Bell's longtime former position. The number of pit reporters was reduced back to four, and Sally Larvick was reassigned back to interviews and features.\nThis would be the final 500 in broadcasting (radio or television) for Rodger Ward, as well as the final appearance for Ron Carrell as a turn reporter. Carrell's final race reporting from turn one included his call of Danny Sullivan's famous spin on lap 120. In addition, the turn one vantage point was moved from the deck of the Southwest Vista to a platform suspended from the E Stand Penthouse.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. This would be the final time the race was shown in tape delay, as in 1986, the race would move to a live broadcast. Jim McKay served as anchor, and the separate \"host\" position was eliminated, in favor of McKay serving as both host and announcer.\nWith only five individuals serving as on-air talent, it was ABC's smallest crew of the decade. The race earned a rating of 9.7 (18 share), the lowest such rating in the tape delay/prime time era. Less than three months later on August 19, 1985, ABC Sports signed an initial three-year deal, long-awaited by auto racing fans, to cover the Indianapolis 500 live flag-to-flag starting in 1986. The 1985 race would be the final time Jim McKay would anchor the broadcast. For 1986, he would be moved to the host position.\nThe broadcast has re-aired numerous times on ESPN Classic since 2000.\nQuotes.\n\"The Indianapolis 500 has a new champion, as Danny Sullivan has won the 69th Indianapolis 500.\" – Paul Page described the finish of the race for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network\n\"The Old American Hero will lose the race [Mario Andretti], the New American Hero is Daniel John Sullivan III of Louisville, Kentucky who has won the Indianapolis 500.\" – Jim McKay called the finish during the ABC Sports broadcast.\n1984–85 USAC Gold Crown Championship.\nThe 1984–85 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1984 and running through May 1985. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season.

        "title": "1984 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 68th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 27, 1984. Rick Mears, who previously won in 1979, won his second (of four) Indy 500 victories driving for Penske. Contenders Tom Sneva and Mario Andretti dropped out of the race in the second half, leaving Mears alone two laps ahead of the field, and he cruised to the victory. Three months after the race, however, Mears would suffer severe leg injuries in a practice crash at Sanair.\nThree rookies finished in the top five: Roberto Guerrero (2nd), Al Holbert (4th), and Michael Andretti (5th). Guerrero and Andretti shared the rookie of the year award. The race is well-remembered for the terrible crash of sportswriter-turned-racer, Pat Bedard, who tumbled through the infield in turn 4 on lap 58. Another rookie, two-time World Champion and future two-time Indy winner Emerson Fittipaldi made a quiet debut.\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1984 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. The 1984 race has the distinction of having the record for most entries (117), and the most cars to actually be seen in the garage (87). Defending race winner Tom Sneva, who broke the 200 mph barrier during time trials in 1977, headlined qualifying on pole day. Sneva made history once again, as he became the first driver to break the 210 mph barrier, en route to his third pole position. This Indy 500 was the last for 33 years that an active Formula One driver, Teo Fabi, featured in the field, with double World Champion Fernando Alonso making his 500 debut in 2017.\nTime trials.\nPole Day – Saturday May 12.\nPole Day was a historic day as Tom Sneva broke the track record with the first lap over 210 mph at Indy. Sneva was also the first driver to break the 200 mph barrier, which he accomplished during time trials in 1977. Nonetheless, going into Pole Day, Mario Andretti was actually the favorite for the pole position, after he ran a practice lap of 212 mph.\nRick Mears was the first driver in the field, completing his run with a track record of 207.847 mph. Rookie Michael Andretti was the next car out (207.805 mph), running surprisingly close to Mears. At 12:45 pm, Mario Andretti took to the track, with high expectations. His first lap was completed at 209.687 mph, a new one-lap track record. His second and third laps dropped off, however. As he came out of turn four on the fourth and final lap, his car quit. He coasted across the finish line powerless to complete the run, but the average speed sank to 207.467 mph. It would be good enough for row 2, but a disappointment compared to his practice speeds earlier in the week.\nShortly before 2 p.m., Tom Sneva took to the track, and electrified the crowd. His third lap was run at 210.423 mph, a new track record, and the first qualifying lap ever at Indy over 210 mph. His fourth lap (210.689) mph was the fastest. His four-lap speed of 210.029 mph was a record, and secured him the pole position. It was Sneva's third Indy pole, and fourth time overall as the fastest qualifier.\nLater in the day, Howdy Holmes squeezed onto the front row with a run of 207.977 mph. It put him in second starting position, and bumped Rick Mears to the outside of the front row. Rookie Michael Andretti out-qualified his father, and would line up in 4th position (Mario qualified 6th).\nA total of 28 cars qualified on pole day.\nSecond Day – Sunday May 13.\nRain kept the track closed until nearly 1 p.m. Only three cars made attempts all afternoon, but none of them were run to completion. Johnny Rutherford went out for his second attempt in a Foyt entry, but never completed a lap due to mechanical problems.\nDuring a practice run, John Paul Jr. wrecked in turn four, suffering leg injuries.\nThird Day – Saturday May 19.\nThe day began with five spots remaining unfilled on the grid. With rain in the forecast for Sunday, several teams scrambled to get their cars prepared to qualify on this day. Bill Alsup was the first driver to make an attempt, but his crew waved off.\nGeorge Snider was the first driver to complete his run, putting in a safe run of 201.860 mph in a Foyt backup car. Later, Steve Chassey wrecked on the first lap of his qualifying attempt. He would sit out the rest of the month with a concussion.\nAt 1 p.m. the field was filled to 33 cars. Chris Kneifel (199.831 mph) was on the bubble. Among the drivers still not in the field was three-time winner Johnny Rutherford. He was struggling to get his car up to speed, and exhausted his three allotted attempts in a Foyt Chevy V-6. The team bought a back-up car from Galles, and Rutherford immediately began shaking the car down. Rutherford was in danger of missing the race for the second year in a row. In 1983, he was sidelined with a broken foot and broken ankle from a practice crash.\nAt 5:50 p.m., with only ten minutes left before the 6 o'clock gun, Johnny Rutherford took to the track for one last attempt to qualify. His first lap was an impressive 203.156 mph, but the car began smoking throughout. Rutherford decided to ride it out, and he was not black-flagged. His speed dropped over the final three laps, but his four-lap average of 202.062 mph was fast enough to bump his way into the field.\nSpike Gehlhausen (200.478 mph) was now on the bubble. Gary Bettenhausen made a last-ditch effort to bump him out, but he waved off after only two laps.\nBump Day – Sunday May 20.\nAs expected, rain washed out the final day of time trials. Since the field had been filled to 33 cars a day earlier, the field was set, and there would be no further qualifying.\nJacques Villeneuve, who suffered a crash during practice, withdrew from the starting field due to injury. The first alternate, Chris Kneifel was re-instated to the field to fill the vacancy. He became the last driver to start the Indianapolis 500 with a qualifying speed under 200 mph.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nRace day dawned cool and clear, with temperatures in the 60s. Rain was forecast for later in the afternoon, but was not expected to affect the race. Mary F. Hulman gave the command to start engines just before 11 a.m., and all cars pulled away for the pace laps.\nAt the start, Rick Mears got the jump and swept across the track to take the lead in turn one. Pole sitter Tom Sneva settled into second, and rookie Michael Andretti went from the inside of row 2 to take third. Mears led the first lap at a speed of 195.610 mph, a new Indy record for the opening lap. Geoff Brabham ducked into the pits after one lap, dropping out with a bad fuel line.\nA few laps later, Michael Andretti passed Tom Sneva to take second place. Gordon Johncock also went to the pits for an unscheduled pit stop.\nFirst half.\nThe first 100 miles were run clean, with no incidents. Tom Sneva led Al Unser Jr., Rick Mears, Mario and Michael Andretti.\nAfter 37 laps, race rookie and future two-time winner Emerson Fittipaldi dropped out due to low oil pressure. The two-time Formula One World Champion had a relatively quiet month of May, acclimating himself gradually to the Indy car circuit. It was a largely unnoticed effort in the underfunded W.I.T. Promotions entry, a pink-painted car. On lap 45, Spike Gehlhausen spun in turn 1, and came to a rest in turn 2 without contact.\nRick Mears took the lead for the second time on lap 54. On lap 58, Patrick Bedard suffered a terrible crash in turn four. The car spun to the inside of the north shortchute, hit the inside wall, flipped over, and barrel-rolled through the grass. The car broke into two pieces, the tub and the engine. Debris littered the track, and a lengthy caution was needed to clean up the incident. Bedard was injured, but the injuries were not life-threatening. Under the caution, Danny Sullivan came up too fast and ran into the car of Roberto Guerrero, hopping up on two wheels, and damaging his right-front suspension. Sullivan dropped out of the race, but Guerrero was able to continue.\nThe lead traded amongst Mears, Sneva, Mario Andretti, Teo Fabi, and Danny Ongais. After the lengthy caution for Bedard's crash, Tom Sneva came to the lead, and led at the halfway point. Around lap 70, the DataSpeed computer timing and scoring system crashed. The remainder of the race would have to be scored manually, and the scoring serials were at times incomplete. However, at no point was the leader of the race unknown or disputed.\nSecond half.\nAt lap 100, Tom Sneva led, looking for back-to-back wins. Al Unser Jr. was in second, Rick Mears third, Mario Andretti fourth, and Michael Andretti fifth. The rest of the top ten was Bobby Rahal, Roberto Guerrero, Al Holbert, Al Unser, Sr., and Teo Fabi. Four laps later, however, Fabi was out with a broken fuel system.\nOn lap 103, Gordon Johncock hit the wall coming out of turn four. He spun to the inside, hit the pit wall, then spun back across the pits and hit the wall separating the pits from the track. He missed hitting Teo Fabi's car, which was being pushed back to the garage, and somehow missed hitting the crew members that were in the sign board area. Johncock injured his left ankle (he had suffered a right ankle injury at Michigan the previous year), and ultimately took a short retirement from racing.\nWith Rick Mears now leading, Mario Andretti started slipping in the standings due to a broken exhaust pipe. The engine was losing rpm, but he was still managing to stay in contention. After running in the top five most of the day, Al Unser Jr. dropped out on lap 131 with a broken water pump.\nTom Sneva briefly took the lead on laps 142-143 during a sequence of pit stops. Rick Mears was back in front on lap 144. With 50 laps to go, Rick Mears led Tom Sneva and Roberto Guerrero. Al Unser Sr. had now worked his way into the top five. Michael Andretti and Mario Andretti were also still in contention.\nOn lap 153, Mario Andretti went into the pits for a routine stop. He was held up in traffic, and the car of Josele Garza cut in front of him down the pit lane. Garza's car made contact, and broke the nosecone of Mario's car. It was too damaged to continue, and Mario was forced to drop out.\nFinish.\nWith several contenders dropping out in quick succession, the race came down to two drivers in the final 100 miles: Rick Mears and Tom Sneva. Scott Brayton stalled on the track on the leader's lap 163, bringing out the caution. With 33 laps to go, Sneva's crew debated pitting, hoping to make it to the finish on one more stop. They planned on pitting with 30 laps to go. On lap 168, however, sparks came from the back of Sneva's car in turn 3 as the field was preparing to go back to green. Sneva immediately ducked into the pits with a broken CV joint, and he climbed from the car. Mears, post-race, would remark, \"I feel bad for him, but it's a relief for me...he was my toughest competitor.\"\nWith Sneva out of the race, Rick Mears now held a commanding lead. No other cars were in contention, with Mears now two laps ahead of the entire field. Mears cruised to the finish, and was not challenged the rest of the way. The only battle remained for second place, between Roberto Guerrero and Al Unser Sr.\nA light drizzle started entering the area in the final 30 laps or so, threatening to end the race early. The heavy rain did not come, and Mears completed the 200 laps at a race record 163.612 mph. Mears won his second Indy 500, with a margin of victory of over two laps. Due to the ongoing scoring issues from the DataSpeed timing and scoring system, Al Unser Sr. was tentatively hand scored in second, with Roberto Guerrero unofficially third. For a brief period, it was Penske Racing's first 1-2 finish in the Indy 500. However, when scoring was ultimately resolved, Guerrero was rightfully elevated to second, with Unser dropping to third. After an eventful day - nearly being caught up in the Bedard crash, being hit by Sullivan during the ensuring yellow flag, overshooting his pit stall during one of his stops, and spinning in turn two - Guerrero was surprised to find out he finished second, and was voted co-Rookie of the Year.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll cars utilized Goodyear tires.\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as the chief announcer for the eighth year. It was Page's eleventh year overall as part of the network crew. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. Luke Walton introduced the starting command during the pre-race ceremonies, but did not have on-air duties during the race itself.\nBob Forbes spent the early segments of the race covering the center pits, then spent the second half of the race concentrating on covering the garage area and track hospital. Sally Larvick was once again used in a limited role, conducting interviews. She also reported from the track hospital in the early portions of the race. This was the last year of the Backstretch reporter. The Backstretch reporter would return for a two-year period from 1989 to 1990 but have a very limited role both years.\nThis would be the final 500 on the crew for Doug Zink, who debuted in 1966. Zink died April 3, 2016.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. Jackie Stewart served as the host position in \"ABC Race Central\" for the final time. Jack Arute joined the crew as a pit reporter, a position he would hold for over 20 years. After 1983, Chris Economaki left ABC, and joined CBS for the Daytona 500 and other NASCAR events. Larry Nuber debuted as a pit reporter in his first Indy assignment, and ABC News and ABC Sports correspondent Ray Gandolf supplied in-depth features.\nA new camera angle was introduced for this broadcast, located on the start's stand over the shoulder of the flagman. The angle would be used at the dropping of the green flag as well as the finish.\nThe race was televised in Brasil for the first time, as the debut of former Formula One champion Emerson Fittipaldi attracted national interest. Record aired the race with Emerson's father Wilson Fittipaldi as announcer. \nThe broadcast has re-aired on ESPN Classic since May 2011."

        "text": "Christopher D. Foote (born December 2, 1956) is a former American football center who played for eleven years in the National Football League (NFL) and the United States Football League (USFL). Foote was primarily a long snapper on punt teams during his NFL career.\nThe starting center for the University of Southern California Trojans during their 1980 Rose Bowl championship season, Foote found his niche in professional football as a long snapper and special teams member.\nIn the NFL Foote spent two years each with the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants, finishing up with five years playing for the Minnesota Vikings. He retired from football in 1991.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nChris Foote was born December 2, 1956, in Louisville, Kentucky. His family relocated to Boulder, Colorado, where he attended Fairview High School.\nA wrestler and track and field participant in the power disciplines of shot put and discus during his high school years, it was as a football player that Foote excelled. He was named to the 50-member \"Parade\" Magazine High School All-American Team, listed at the offensive tackle and nose guard positions.\nCollege career.\nFoote enrolled at the University of Southern California (USC), where he majored in Speech Communications. His time there was injury-wracked and he underwent no fewer than three operations to repair damage to his knees during his time at USC.\nFoote finally got healthy during his senior year and started every game at center for the Trojans during the 1979 season — a year which culminated with a victory at the 1980 Rose Bowl.\nAfter the 17–16 Rose Bowl win over Ohio State, Foote was effusive in praising his mates. \"It was like so many other games this year, it was like at LSU, at Cal, at Washington — there's just that confidence we'll do it, no matter the situation,\" he told the \"Los Angeles Times.\" \"Our offense is good at wearing people down. You can actually feel it over the course of a game. The linebacker's not stepping up as hard, or the lineman's not charging as hard... We just wear them down.\"\nProfessional career.\nFoote was drafted in the sixth round (144th overall) of the 1980 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts.\nHe played for the Colts during the 1980 and 1981 seasons, finding a spot on the roster as the team's long snapper on punts. He played in all 16 of the Colts' games in the 1980 season without making a single errant snap, making 2 tackles and contributing 7 assists in punt coverage. He also made a fumble recovery in a late November game against the Buffalo Bills, setting up a scoring drive as part of a 28–24 victory.\nFoote similarly saw action in every Colts game of the 1981 Colts season, making 2 tackles and 4 assists on coverage and downing two punts inside the 10-yard line. Foote was listed as a reserve center and guard on the team's depth chart during these years.\nFoote was a member of the New York Giants in 1982 and 1983. In the 1982 season he played in 12 games for the Giants as long snapper, making 5 tackles and contributing 2 assists in punt coverage.\nFoote moved to the United States Football League (USFL) in 1984, playing for the Los Angeles Express before moving to the Tampa Bay Bandits for the 1985 season.\nHe returned to the NFL to play for the Minnesota Vikings from 1987 to 1990. He saw action in 6 games during his first year with the team and played the full 16-game schedule in the 1988, 1989, and 1990 seasons. This includes 5 games in which he started at center in 1988 and 3 games in 1990, when he was impressed into duty by injuries.\nLife after football.\nFoote retired from professional football after the 1990 season, at the age of 34.\nDuring his playing career, Foote made his home in Laguna Hills, California, where he enjoyed playing golf, driving sports cars, and showing dogs."

It was started by Detroit Red Wings owner Bruce Norris with a vision of building a league to be affiliated with the National Hockey League (NHL). The vice-chairman of the team was John Ziegler, who went on to become president of the NHL in 1977.\nThe Lions played their home games at Wembley Arena and had a record of 52 wins, 13 losses and 7 ties. They toured Europe to promote a proposed European professional ice hockey league, originally scheduled to start for the 1974–75 season. The original plan for this new league was to have the top teams participate in the Stanley Cup playoffs against the traditional North American NHL teams. The league did not gain support and never started play.\nThe team was named for an earlier London Lions, which was founded in 1924 by Blane Sexton, played at Westminster from 1927, then at Golders Green and the Hammersmith Palais until 1934, when they moved to Wembley Arena as the Wembley Lions. In 1930, they won the first ever British Championship."

In his 31 years as an NFL official, Tunney received a record 29 post-season assignments, including ten Championship games and Super Bowls VI, XI and XII and named as an alternate in Super Bowl XVIII. He remains the only referee who has worked consecutive Super Bowls and likely will be the only one to do so.\nFollowing Ben Dreith's death in April 2021, Tunney is the only referee from the first 16 Super Bowls who is still alive.\nLife and career.\nNicknamed the \"Dean of NFL Referees\", Tunney was the first official to be named to the \"All-Madden Team\" in 1990 and won the \"Gold Whistle Award\" in 1992 from the National Association of Sports Officials (NASO). He wore uniform number 32 for most of his career but when the NFL numbered each position separately from 1979 through 1981 rather than assigning one number per official, he wore number 3. Tunney's trademark signal upon a successful field goal, or extra point, featured raising his arms with fists clenched then opening both fists simultaneously to indicate the attempt as \"good\".\nOfficials who worked on Tunney's crew for many years included former NFL great Pat Harder at umpire and head linesman Burl Toler, the NFL's first African-American official.\nTunney graduated from Franklin High School in Los Angeles class of 1947 then after he graduated from nearby Occidental College in 1951, Tunney began officiating football and basketball working high school, college and Pacific Coast Conference (Pac-10) games until 1967. In 1960, he was hired to work in the NFL as a field judge before being promoted to the referee position in 1967 where he would stay for the remainder of his career until retiring after the 1990 NFL season. His final game was the 1990 AFC Championship Game between the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Raiders played January 20, 1991. He currently works on the NFL officiating staff as an Observer, attending games each week helping with improvement of the current game officials.\nStill active in league affairs and many sports issues, Tunney was a member of Commissioner Tagliabue's Officiating 2000 Committee and was Vice Chair of the U.S. Olympic Committee for Northern California (Sydney 2000 Games). In 1993, he founded the Jim Tunney Youth Foundation, which supports community programs and resources that work with youth to develop leadership, work skills, wellness and self-esteem. He writes a weekly column for the \"Monterey Herald\" and is a motivational speaker.\nJim Tunney was the Boys' Vice Principal at Abraham Lincoln High School in the City of Los Angeles, California. He also served as the Principal of Fairfax High School in Los Angeles from 1964 to 1970.\nMemorable games.\nHere is a listing of some notable games Tunney was involved in:\nEducator.\nOff the field, Tunney had a long career as an educator and school administrator, starting out in 1951 as a teacher at Los Angeles' Lincoln High School, later becoming vice principal from 1959 to 1964. He then served as a principal of Los Angeles high schools Fairfax (1964–1970), Franklin (1972–1973), and Hollywood High School (1973–74). He became assistant superintendent of secondary education for the Bellflower Unified School District in 1975 and served as the district's superintendent in 1977. He left education for 16 years before becoming headmaster from 1993 to 1994 of the York School in Monterey, California, joining the school's board of trustees in 1995 and remaining in that post to this day. He also joined the board of trustees for Monterey Peninsula College in 1997 and served on that board until 2009 (12 years - 6 of which were as board chair. He was awarded MPC's President's Award in 2009 - only the third so named as well as 2009 Public Official of the Year by the Monterey Peninsula Chamber of Commerce. In 2011, he was inducted into the Fairfax High School Hall of Fame (the only administrator so inducted). In 2011, he was also inducted into the California Community Coaches Hall of Fame."

When the alcohol cars pitted to re-fuel, Roberts took the lead for the first time. At 300 miles, Roberts made his one and only pit stop for fuel and a single tire change, and gave up the lead to Snyder.

        "text": "The 25th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Monday, May 31, 1937. With temperatures topping out at , it is one of the hottest days on record for the Indy 500.\nSpeedway legend Wilbur Shaw won the first of his three \"500\" victories. In the waning laps, Shaw's car was leaking oil, and was suffering from critically low oil pressure. He had to nurse his car to the finish line. Second place Ralph Hepburn, aware of Shaw's troubles, began closing dramatically. Shaw held off Hepburn at the checkered flag by 2.16 seconds, the closest finish in Indy history to that point. It was a record that would stand until 1982.\nTime trials.\nTen-lap (25 mile) qualifying runs were utilized. During the time trials held on May 28, the car of Overton Phillips burst into flames when his crankshaft broke and punctured the gas tank. He then crashed into the pit area, killing spectator George Warford of Indianapolis. Injured were Phillips and his riding mechanic, Walter King, Anthony Caccia, the brother of Joe Caccia, who died in practice for the 1931 race, and Otto Rohde of Toledo, Ohio, a crew member for Champion Spark Plug. Rohde succumbed to his injuries on June 1, 1937.\nOn the same day, having completed four of ten scheduled qualifying laps, Frank McGurk's car plunged through an inner rail, overturned and ejected both McGurk, who was hospitalized in serious condition but survived, and his riding mechanic, Albert Opalko, who was killed. The crash was caused by a broken connecting rod.\nRace details.\nFor 1937, riding mechanics were required. Jigger Johnson served as Wilbur Shaw's riding mechanic. Johnson, who also rode with 1931 winner Louis Schneider, became the second two-time Indianapolis 500 winning riding mechanic. Johnson would be the final winning riding mechanic in Indy history. Starting in the 1938 Indianapolis 500, riding mechanics were made optional, and would no longer be utilized in the race by any entrants.\nAfter being banned for several years, superchargers were once again permitted.\nJimmy Snyder.\nOne of the more notable performances of the 1937 race belonged to Jimmy Snyder. During time trials on May 22, Snyder took to the track for his 10-lap attempt late in the day, nearing sundown. He ran his first lap at a track record of 130.492 mph. His second lap (129.422 mph) and third lap (127.334 mph) dropped off, and then officials waved off the run due to darkness. Snyder's run was officially incomplete, but the single-lap track record stood.\nThe following day, Snyder returned to the track, and while he did not match his speed from the day before, he finished his run at 125.287 mph, the fastest qualifier in the field. He would line up 19th on race day.\nAt the start, Snyder blew by most of the field, and was running as high as 6th at the conclusion of the first lap. By the fourth lap he was in the lead, and proceeded to lead 24 laps. On lap 27, however, he dropped out with mechanical trouble.\nLate Race Summary.\nLate in the race, Wilbur Shaw held a comfortable lead, and had lapped second place Ralph Hepburn. With about 20 laps to go, however, Shaw's car had been leaking oil, and had nearly lost nearly all of the oil out of the crankcase. In addition, the right rear tire was heavily worn. Shaw slowed down considerably in an effort to nurse his car to the finish line. Shaw and his riding mechanic John \"Jigger\" Johnson were both suffering from burns due to the leaking oil. Second place Hepburn realized Shaw's problems, and began a charge to catch him. He unlapped himself, and went on a tear in hopes of victory.\nAs the laps dwindled down, Ralph Hepburn was closing dramatically. Shaw was largely defenseless, as he was carefully nursing the car around. As the car went in and out of the turns, the oil pressure was rising and dropping, and Shaw was calculating how much time he could give up per lap and still maintain the lead. Hepburn closed to a straightaway deficit, then was nearly in reach. On the final lap Hepburn pulled to within a few seconds, and by the last turn he was directly behind Shaw and looking to pass him for the win.\nWith nothing to lose, Shaw floored the accelerator and pulled away down the final straight. He held off Hepburn for the win by 2.16 seconds, the closest finish in Indy 500 history to that point. The margin would stand as the closest finish ever at Indy until 1982.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie"

He pitted for fuel at 350 miles, allowing Ted Horn to take the point. But Meyer caught him, pulled away and became the first 3-time \"500\" winner. He wasn't sure his fuel would last until the end.

Pete DePaolo, the 1925 winner, was the team principal, becoming the first individual to win the race separately as a driver and an owner.\nThe race was part of the 1935 AAA Championship Car season.\nPre-race and qualifying.\nTen-lap (25 mile) qualifying runs were utilized.\nOn May 21, nine days before the race, three prospective participants lost their lives. Rookie Johnny Hannon, on just his first lap at racing speed, had his car go over the outside retaining wall and was killed from a fractured skull. Later that day, driver Hartwell \"Stubby\" Stubblefield also had his car go over the outside wall, and both he and his riding mechanic Leo Whitaker died from injuries they received being thrown from the vehicle. Kelly Petillo, the eventual winner, had his own difficulties getting into the field. His initial qualifying run (a record-breaking 121.687 mph) was voided when his car was ruled to have exceeded the fuel limit. Returning to the track, he had an engine blow, before finally having a qualifying run of 115.095 that placed him 22nd in the field.\nRace.\nDriver Clay Weatherly would beg Leon Duray, the owner of Hannon's crashed car, to allow him to drive it in the race. The car would prove no luckier for Weatherly, who would be killed when the car crashed through the inner guard rail coming out of turn four on lap nine. Rex Mays would lead most of the first before being forced out with mechanical failure. Petillo had climbed to second, and after Mays' departure led most of the remainder other than briefly following a pit stop. Petillo easily broke the record for the fastest average speed (106.240 mph) despite being slowed somewhat by rain near the end of the race. Petillo received approximately $33,000 in winnings for the race.\nAftermath.\nThe driver deaths in 1935 caused the Speedway to develop what is now known as the Rookie Orientation Program, which has been required for first-time drivers since 1936. Adjustments were also made to the configuration of the turns. Petillo would race in five more 500s, never again finishing higher than 18th.

Of the 33 cars that began the race, only 12 were running at the finish, although there were no crashes resulting in serious injuries. One serious incident involved George Bailey, whose car went over the outside wall, but resulted in only a broken wrist to the driver. The finish was the closest in the history of the race to that point, with second-place finisher Mauri Rose within 100 yards of Cummings at the finish (officially 27.25 seconds behind). Rose would also file a protest that Cummings had illegally gained ground during a \"slow-down\" period following a crash.\nCummings was accompanied by riding mechanic Earl Unversaw. The race was part of the 1934 AAA Championship Car season.\nBackground.\nIn an effort to improve safety, the maximum field size was capped at 33 cars. 33 starters has remained the maximum field size since, with the exception of the 1979 and 1997 races. After several consecutive 500s with multiple fatalities, efforts were also made to reduce speeds through fuel limits; entries were limited to of fuel for qualification and of fuel for the race.\nFor 1934, riding mechanics were required.\nTime trials.\nTen-lap (25 mile) qualifying runs were utilized.

Cummings then closed on Rose and passed him with 70 miles to go. Both drivers, confident that they had enough fuel, then upped their pace to reach 140 mph on the straights. Cummings and Rose were never more than 30 seconds apart in the last part of the race. Cummings took the checkered with a new record average speed, despite the new fuel limitations.

The race was part of the 1933 AAA Championship Car season.\nMeyer was accompanied by riding mechanic Lawson Harris.\nThe 1933 month of May at Indianapolis was the deadliest running of the 500. Five participants were fatally injured. During practice, Bill Denver and his riding mechanic Bob Hurst were killed in a crash. On race day, Mark Billman was killed in a crash on lap 79 while Lester Spangler and his riding mechanic G.L. \"Monk\" Jordan were killed in a crash on lap 132. It was the fifth straight year at least one competitor died in a crash during the month.\nTime trials.\nTen-lap (25 mile) qualifying runs were utilized. 42 cars averaged faster than the designated 100mph mark, making for the largest starting field in the race's history.\nRace summary.\nBill Cummings led early on from the pole, turning laps of 113 mph. He faded from the front and dropped out with mechanical problems. Louis Meyer came from 7th starting position to first lead at 325 miles. By 400 miles, he had a commanding lead and was signaled \"E-Z\" by his pit crew to slow from his 110 mph pace.

Cars were allowed a maximum of 6 quarts of oil, and could not add oil during the race (a rule still in place today). These changes meant to send \"leakers\" to the garage and not make the track slippery. Also, fuel tanks were a maximum of 15 gallons, instead of 40 gallons or more. Cars would have to pit more often for fuel and crews could inspect tire wear and other problems. \n\"Will Overhead\".\nIn 1933, one of the more famous bits of Indy 500 nostalgia occurred. Telegraph was still being used to transmit race information to newspapers and other outlets across the United States. George Zanaon, a typesetter for \"The World-Independent\" newspaper in the town of Walsenburg, Colorado was preparing a story for that day's Indianapolis 500. Since Memorial Day was a holiday, his young editor John B. Kirkpatrick was alone monitoring the Associated Press wire for race updates. The race took several hours to complete, and the AP wire was shut down prior to the finish. Kirkpatrick had nearly the entire story ready for print, minus the winner of the race. A helpful AP editor in Denver advised him that he would send the name of the winner via Western Union telegraph.\nThe telegraph Kirkpatrick received, in typical newspaper shorthand lingo was: \"WILL OVERHEAD WINNER OF INDIANAPOLIS 500,\" meaning that he would send the information by telegraph when the information was available. The young editor misunderstood the jargon in the message, and interpreted it as saying a driver named \"Will Overhead\" was the winner. The headline read \"Will Overhead won the Indianapolis Memorial Day race today. At the two hundred fifty mile post Babe Stapp was leading the string of racing cars, but gave way to Overhead on the last half of the 500 mile grind.\" The true winner was Louis Meyer. The gaffe put the town of Walsenburg, and \"The World-Independent\" newspaper (now known as the \"Huerfano World Journal\"), on the map in racing circles."

Attrition was the story of the race, with 26 of the 40 cars dropping out due to crashes or mechanical failure. A record eight different drivers led laps during the race, with no driver seemingly able to hold the lead without experiencing some sort of trouble. For the third year in a row, Billy Arnold looked as if he would be the dominant car, but he sailed over the turn three wall on lap 59. Rookie Bob Carey also hit the wall while leading. Fred Frame took the lead for good on lap 152, and won from the 27th starting position - the furthest back of any winner except for Ray Harroun in 1911 and later, Louis Meyer in 1936. Frame was accompanied by riding mechanic Jerry Houck.\nIn the third year of the \"stock-based\" formula (also known as the \"Junk\" formula), speeds were beginning to increase once again, but not quite to levels seen in the late-1920s. Lou Moore qualified for the pole position with an average speed of 117.363 mph, the fastest time trial run in three years. Likewise on race day, Frame's winning average speed of 104.144 mph broke Peter DePaolo's record set back in 1925.\nThe race was part of the 1932 AAA Championship Car season. The month was marred by two fatalities during practice. Riding mechanic Harry Cox was killed in a crash on May 25, and driver Milton Jones died from injuries suffered in a crash on May 27.\nPractice – April.\nThe deadline for entries to be received was midnight on Monday May 2. Teams and drivers began arriving at the Speedway in early April, setting up shop in Gasoline Alley. In addition, Tom Beall's popular diner was already open in the garage area. Tony Gulotta was on the track in the Hunt Special on April 6, as was Lou Moore in the Boyle Valve Special. Making news in mid-April was Argentine driver Juan Gaudino, who arrived on April 13 to enter the race for the first time. Gaudino had intended to enter in 1931, but withdrew after a crash in South America just before he was to make the trip.\nOn Monday April 18, Joe Russo was practicing on the track when he lost control at the north end and crashed into the retaining wall. He suffered minor injuries to his head and face, and needed three stitches to his lip. The frame of the car was bent, but the car was expected to be repaired.\nBilly Devore, Terry Curley, S.T. \"Pink\" Donaldson, and Bert Lustig, all arrived from the west coast on April 21, each looking for rides. Some of the biggest news came on April 27. Babe Stapp was seriously injured in a crash at Legion Ascot Speedway, and would be forced to sit out the month of May.\nBy the end of April, at least nine cars were already at the Speedway being prepped. Drivers were even spending some free time at the Speedway Golf Course.\nPractice – Week 1.\nThe deadline for entries to be received was midnight on Monday May 2. Though initially down from the previous year (72 entries), at least 40 cars had submitted entries by May 1, and more were expected when postmarked entries were all processed.\nTime trials.\nQualifications was scheduled for seven days, starting on Saturday May 21, and continuing through Friday May 27. Four-lap (10 mile) qualifying runs were used. Each entry was allowed three attempts to qualify. The minimum speed for qualifying was set at 100 mph. Each day of time trials would end at sundown.\nSaturday May 21.\nThe first day of time trials was scheduled for Saturday May 21 from 10:00 a.m. to 6:59 p.m. (sundown). All cars were required to be in line no later than 5 p.m. in order to make a qualifying attempt. Over 12,000 spectators arrived under hot and sunny weather conditions. During a run in the morning, Bryan Saulpaugh driving one of Harry Miller's 16-cylinder machines, had just completed a lap of 116 mph when a tire blew going into turn 1. Traveling more than 120 mph, he entered the turn too fast and the tread sheared off the tire. The car broke into a spin, but Saulpaugh was able to keep the car off the wall. Also having trouble in the morning was Zeke Meyer, who hit the wall in turn four after something broke in the steering mechanism.\nFrank Brisko (111.149 mph) was the first driver to complete a qualifying run. Luther Johnson blew a tire and pulled into the pits during his first attempt. The early qualifiers were led by Billy Arnold, who put in a four-lap average of 116.290 mph. Bryan Saulpaugh, who had avoided serious mishap during a practice run, rebounded to post a four-lap average of 114.369 mph, good enough for the front row.\nLate in the day, Lou Moore took the track, and grabbed the pole position with a four-lap average of 117.363 mph. His fourth lap (118.577 mph) was a single-lap track record for a non-supercharged engine. Last year's polesitter Russ Snowberger qualified fourth.\nThe day ended with the field filled to 21 cars.\nSunday May 22.\nThe second day of time trials was held Sunday May 22. Only two cars qualified, Wilbur Shaw and Al Aspen. Shaw's four-lap average speed (114.326 mph) time was identical to Russ Snowberger's from a day earlier.\nMonday May 23.\nThe third day of time trials was held Monday May 23. Hartwell \"Stubby\" Stubblefield wowed the crowd with a first lap of 117.310 mph, nearly as fast as the pole position. He upped his speed to 117.540 mph, and appeared to be on his way to becoming the fastest qualifier. On his fourth and final lap, however, he sensed he had a tire going down. Going into turn 3, he backed off and attempted to coast around to the pits, intending to abort the run. He shut the engine off on the mainstretch, but inadvertently coasted across the finish line. Officials ruled that he had completed the run, and the time would stand. His fourth lap of 101.488 pulled his four-lap average down to 112.988 mph. Instead of being the fastest qualifier, he had to settle for the slower speed, but nevertheless, was safely qualified.\nBob McDonogh made a conservative run of 113.279 mph, to be the fastest car of the afternoon, and the first four-wheel drive car in Indy history. Phil Shafer was the only other qualifier, putting in a speed of 110.708 mph without wearing a helmet.\nBy the end of the third day, only 26 (of 40) grid position had been filled. With many strong contenders still in the garage area, officials reiterated that qualifications would continue through Saturday as needed, to ensure all cars had the opportunity to qualify.\nTuesday May 24.\nThe fourth day of time trials was held Tuesday May 24. Qualifications continued to move at a slow pace, as only two cars completed runs Tuesday. Late in the day, Gus Schrader was the first driver out, in the four-wheel drive Miller Special. The car had only been on the track three days, and the 112.003 mph average, though safe to make the field, was said to be modest to its capabilities. Fred Frame was the only other driver on the track, also driving a newly arrived machine. Frame's car had arrived only three days earlier, and had been on the track only once, but not at speed.\nWednesday May 25.\nThe fifth day of time trials was held Wednesday May 25. To the increasing chagrin of officials, only one car completed a qualifying attempt, further dragging out the already slow qualifying process. Chet Miller secured the 29th spot in the field, leaving eleven spots open. The day was marred by the death of Harry Cox, the riding mechanic for Bennie Benefiel. The car hit the inside wall, lost a wheel, then skidded into the outside wall. The car went over the outside retaining wall in turn 1, and dropped twenty feet to the ground. It hit two trees, then came to rest against another tree. Benefiel and Cox were thrown from the car. Benefiel was conscious but seriously injured. Cox suffered a broken neck and other injuries, and died at the scene.\nLouis Schneider had his car out on the track for practice, but came in complaining of steering problems. Roy Painter announced his car was withdrawn due to an illegal tread width.\nThursday May 26.\nThe sixth day of time trials was held Thursday May 26. For the second day in a row, only one car completed a run. Louis Schneider, driving the same Bowes Seal Fast entry he won with in 1931, took the 30th starting position.\nFriday May 27.\nThe seventh day of time trials was held on Friday May 27. The day was marred by the second fatality in three days. Milton Jones and his riding mechanic Harold Gray were on a practice run early in the day when car went out of control in turn one. The car went over the wall in turn one, and landed upright on a grassy plot outside of the track. Both Jones and Gray were thrown from the car. Gray survived, suffering a broken arm and internal injuries. Jones died about six hours later at City Hospital. In a separate incident, Ira Hall crashed his already-qualified car in turn 3. The car was badly damaged, but Hall was not injured. Also having trouble was Paul Rice, whose car broke a front axle. He narrowly missed hitting the outside wall at the exit of turn four.\nSeven cars completed qualifying runs, but George Howie would eventually be \"crowded out\" (bumped) from the field on Saturday. Gene Haustein made an unsuccessful attempt.\nSaturday May 28.\nThe final day of time trials was held on Saturday May 28. Due to the number of spots remaining, and the number of entries still to qualify, the hours for qualifying were extended to 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. for Saturday. The field was filled to 40 cars, and two drivers (George Howie and James Patterson) were \"crowded out.\" Kelly Petillo made the field just before the close of qualifying.\nAfter qualifying concluded, the track was closed to clean up oil spills and prepare the surface for the race. A brief session was allowed late Sunday afternoon for the traditional \"carburetion tests.\"\nRace summary.\nStart.\nThe race began at 10:00 a.m. with Edsel Ford driving the Lincoln Model KB pace car and Theodore E. \"Pop\" Meyers riding along, marshaling the start. Honorary starter Gar Wood joined Seth Kline to wave the green flag. At the start, Lou Moore took the lead into turn one from the pole position. Billy Arnold was second, Billy Winn third, and Ernie Triplett fourth. Arnold took the lead on the second lap, and began setting the pace. Arnold's average speed after 10 laps was 110.250 mph, breaking the previous record set in 1928.\nOn lap 3, Al Gordon crashed over the outside wall in turn 4. Stubby Stubblefield sideswiped Gordon, but was able to continue Gordon and his riding mechanic were uninjured. Also crashing out on lap 7 was Gus Schrader.\nFirst half.\nAttrition started to mount early with several cars dropping out in the first 100 miles. Several other cars were into the pits with early tire wear, and Joe Huff needed a three-minute pit stop to repair a leaking radiator cap.\nAt the 50-mile mark, Billy Arnold led Lou Moore by 49 seconds. By the 100-mark, the lead had stretched to a minute and 18 seconds, and Bob Carey had moved up to second. By lap 50, Arnold had lapped the entire field except for Carey, and was running a record pace.\nOn lap 59, Billy Arnold's day came to end in a bad crash in turn 3. Arnold and riding mechanic Spider Matlock crashed over the wall while leading. Arnold suffered a broken shoulder and Matlock a broken pelvis – injuries similar (but opposite) to those suffered by them in a crash a year earlier. Arnold would retire from racing after the crash. The incident put Bob Carey in the lead from lap 59–94. After the race, Arnold found out that his grandmother had died the day before the race.\nCarey led Lou Moore as the race passed the 200-mile distance. The race was still running at a record-shattering pace. Moore dropped out with bad timing gears, and Ernie Triplett moved up to second. On lap 94, Carey hit the outside wall in turn 4 while leading, spun around three times, and drove the car back to the pits with a damaged left front wheel. He lost ten minutes in the pits, and that handed the lead to Ernie Triplett.\nAlso in the pits was 8th place Fred Frame, who had water boiling from the radiator. Frame was about four laps down, and was in the pits for about one minute.\nSecond half.\nAt the halfway point, Ernie Triplett led Howdy Wilcox II, Louis Schneider and Cliff Bergere. Triplett's time in front was short-lived. Ira Hall took the lead on lap 110, and Triplett dropped out after 125 laps with a failed clutch. Schneider dropped out at the same time with a broken frame.\nWith contenders dropping out in quick succession, Fred Frame came to the lead on lap 126. Frame led Wilbur Shaw, the only other car on the lead lap. Howdy Wilcox II and Cliff Bergere were running 3rd-4th one lap down.\nAs the race reached the 400-mile mark, Frame continued to lead. Wilbur Shaw lost over nine minutes after stalling his car in the pits then eventually dropped out with a broken axle. Frame was now all alone out front, and controlled the race to the finish. In the final 20 laps, Frame held an over 40-second lead over Howdy Wilcox II, with Cliff Bergere in third.\nFinish.\nLate in the race, three incidents brought attention. On lap 182, Ira Hall blew a tire, spun and brushed the wall in the south end of the track. He was able to continue, but left his riding mechanic behind when he limped back to the pits. He re-joined the race, and was issued a one-lap penalty for driving off without the riding mechanic. He completed the 500 miles in 7th place. Luther Johnson lost a wheel on the mainstretch, and Tony Gulotta blew a tire in turn one. Gulotta's tire flung off the wheel, and nearly went over the fence into the stands. On the 178th lap, Pete Kreis skidded and crashed on the mainstretch.\nFred Frame led 58 of the final 75 laps and won the race by 44 seconds over Howdy Wilcox II. After strong showings in previous years, Frame, accompanied by riding mechanic Jerry Houck won with an average speed of , a time that broke the seven-year-old record set by Peter DePaolo (1925). Frame charged from 27th starting position, aided by high attrition and a steady pace. It was the furthest back at that time that any driver had won the race except for Ray Harroun in 1911. Louis Meyer would equal Ray Harroun's furthest back to win (28th) in 1936. Frame's drive was not without incident, as he required six pit stops, each time taking on water to battle an overheating engine.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie"

        "title": "1931 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 19th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, May 30, 1931. Race winner Louis Schneider, who led the final 34 laps, was accompanied by riding mechanic Jigger Johnson.\nThe start of the race was delayed two hours due to rain. Defending race winner Billy Arnold charged from 18th starting position to lead the race by lap 7. Arnold, who had dominated the 1930 race (led 198 laps), proceeded to lead the next 155 laps, and built up a five-lap lead over second place. His rear axle broke on lap 162. He spun in turn four, was hit by another car, driven by Luther Johnson, and went over the outside wall. One of his errant wheels bounced across Georgetown Road, and struck and killed an 11-year-old boy, Wilbur C. Brink. Arnold suffered a broken pelvis, and his riding mechanic, Spider Matlock, broke his shoulder.\nThe race was part of the 1931 AAA Championship Car season.\nPractice.\nThe deadline for entries to be received was midnight on Friday May 1. A record 72 cars were entered, for 40 starting positions. The track was made available for practice at the beginning of the month, and most entries were expected to arrive mid-month.\nWeek 1.\nBy the end of the first full week of practice, track activity had been sparse. Several of the top teams were expected to arrive within the next week. In addition, rain and cold weather kept drivers off the track over the weekend and into Monday.\nTime trials.\nFour-lap (10 mile) qualifying runs were utilized, with 90 mph set as the required minimum speed. Diesel entries were allowed a special rules exception, given them a guaranteed starting position provided they complete their run at a speed of greater than 80 mph. Riding mechanics were required to accompany the drivers on all cars during qualifying.\nSaturday May 23.\nThe first day of time trials was held Saturday May 23, with the track available for qualifying from 10:00 a.m. to 7:01 p.m. (sundown). The minimum qualifying speed for gasoline powered engines was set at 90 mph. Dave Evans was the first car out to qualify, in the Cummins Diesel Special. Evans completed his run at 96.871 mph, well above the 80 mph minimum speed required for diesel-powered entries.\nRuss Snowberger won the pole position with a four-lap average speed of 112.796 mph. A total of 19 cars took to the track, but only 17 cars officially qualified. Rounding out the front row was Bill Cummings and first year driver Paul Bost. Snowberger winning the pole was a surprise, not only because his nearly-stock motor Studebaker outperformed Cummings and others, but three of the favorites for the pole did not even get to put in a time. Cummings first attempt early in the day started out with a lap of 115.001 mph, but he suffered a failed clutch. Cumming's second attempt run managed only a 112.563 mph, just 0.66 seconds shy of bumping Snowberger from the pole.\nShorty Cantlon was kept off the track for the whole weekend, still awaiting an engine rebuild. He was expected to qualify on Tuesday. Louis Meyer, another favorite, took to the track to make an attempt in the 16-cylinder Sampson Special. He came down the mainstretch, but lost control in turn one, brushing the inside and outside wall. He drove back to the pits with a bent frame, and would be forced to make repairs.\nDefending pole position and race winner Billy Arnold was having trouble finding speed over the past couple of days, but scrambled to make an attempt late in the day on Saturday. He wheeled to the line at 7:08 p.m., past the deadline for the track to close. Officials decided to allow the run, and his four-lap average of 113.848 mph tentatively took the pole position. After the run, some drivers protested, and during a post-qualifying inspection, it was found that Arnold's brake cables were not connected. During the rush to get the car on the track, the crew had neglected to connect the brake cables, and technical committee chairman Louis H. Schwitzer disallowed the run.\nSunday May 24.\nThe second day of time trials was held on Sunday May 24. The track was for available for qualifying from 1 p.m. to 7:01 p.m. (sundown). Only two cars completed qualifying runs. One day after having his run disallowed, Billy Arnold put his car in the field at 116.080 mph. he became the fastest qualifier in the field.\nDuring a practice run, the car of Floyd \"Sparky\" Sparks caught on fire down the backstretch, ignited from an oil or gasoline leak. Attempting to close off the fuel line, he hit the retaining wall in turn three. The car was badly burned. Sparks would not be able to qualify.\nTony Gulotta was the only other driver to complete a qualifying attempt. Gulotta left the Bowes Seal Fast team and instead moved over to the Hunt Special entered by Ab Jenkins. Freddie Winnai took his old seat. Gulotta would have been fast enough for the second row, but as a second day qualifier, he would line up 19th on the grid. Lou Moore tried to qualify Pete DePaolo's Boyle Valve Special, but a broken clutch prevented the attempt. At the end of the day, the field was filled to 19 cars, with 21 spots remaining.\nMonday May 25.\nThe third day of qualifying was held Monday May 25, with the track available from 2 p.m. to 7:02 p.m. (sundown). The day was marred by the fatal accident of Joe Caccia and his riding mechanic Clarence Grover. Caccia was on the track in the morning for a practice run, when the car skidded out of control entering turn 2. The car slid about 150 feet, and then slid into the outside barrier. The car ripped a hole through the outside retaining wall, hurtled 100 feet down the embankment, and crashed into a tree. Both drivers were likely thrown from the car, landed next to it, and the car had burst into flames. Both drivers were killed instantly, and were enveloped by the flames.\nFive cars completed qualification runs, filling the field to 24 cars. Jimmy Gleason (111.400 mph) was the fastest car of the day. Frank Farmer, formerly of the M.A. Yagle entry, took over the Jones-Miller Special, and was the second-fastest car of the day.\nStill yet to qualify was Shorty Cantlon, who practiced unofficially over 118 mph, but suffered a broken universal joint during the day.\nTuesday May 26.\nThe fourth day of qualifying was held Tuesday May 26, with the track available from 2 p.m. to 7:02 p.m. (sundown). Nine cars completed runs, led by Louis Meyer in the Samson Special. Meyer was qualified comfortably, though probably below his potential speed, said to be playing it safe after his crash on Saturday. After considerable delay, Shorty Cantlon put his 16-cylinder machine in the field, as did Leon Duray. Duray had been suffering from overheating issues all week, and observers noted he qualified with water boiling from the radiator, indicating the problems were still not solved.\nWednesday May 27.\nThe final day of qualifying was held Wednesday May 26, with the track available from 2 p.m. to 7:04 p.m. (sundown). The day opening with seven spots remaining in the grid. Out of a total of 72 entries, upwards of twenty cars were considered available for time trials.\nDuring a busy day of track activity, a total of eight cars qualified for the starting field, filling the grid to 40 cars. At least twelve other cars attempted to qualify, but were too slow or failed to complete their run. The fastest car of the day was Gene Haustein (107.823 mph), followed by Myron Stevens.\nCar owner Fred Clemmons managed to get both of his Hoosier Pete entries qualified, despite the cars only arriving at the track for the first time Wednesday morning. Billy Winn and Herman Schurch both took to the track for shake down laps at slow speed, and practiced for only about 45 minutes. The cars were brought to the garage for adjustments to the springs and shock absorbers, and later in the afternoon were safely qualified to the grid with only about 20 laps of practice each.\nWilbur Shaw and Ralph DePalma were both at the track Wednesday, looking to qualify. Officials deemed that DePalma had not arrived in enough time to qualify, and the car he was to drive had not shown sufficient speed. Shaw took to the track for a qualifying attempt late in the day, but he pulled off with a broken crankshaft before starting the run.\nWith less than fifteen minutes remaining in the day, Joe Huff was the final qualifier. Huff would have \"crowded out\" Harry Butcher, the slowest qualifier. After qualifying was over, however, Pete Kreis in the Coleman Special withdrew due to handling problems. As a result, Harry Butcher in the Butcher Brothers Special was restored to the starting field.\nThe track was to be available on Thursday for final \"carburation tests.\" No track activity was scheduled for Friday.\nRace recap.\nStart.\nOvernight and morning rain delayed the start from 10:00 a.m. to 12 p.m. The Indianapolis Drum and Bugle Corps. paraded and entertained the early arriving fans, including Governor Harry G. Leslie and his entourage of seven other state governors. At noon, pace car driver Willard \"Big Boy\" Rader guided the field in the Cadillac 370 V-12 pace car for one unscored pace lap. Speedway general manager Theodore E. Meyers rode as a passenger. Rader and Meyers pulled over on the mainstretch, and the green flag was displayed for the flying start. The race began with Paul Bost grabbing the lead from the outside of the front row. Bost led the first two laps. Bill Cummings took the lead for laps 3–6.\nDefending winner Billy Arnold, who started 18th (and was the fastest qualifier), went on a tear through the field at the start. He passed 17 cars, and took the lead on lap 7. He picked up where he left off a year earlier, and started pulling out to about a 15-second lead.\nAfter suffering constant overheating problems during practice and time trials, Leon Duray pitted his car after only six laps. The overheating problems persisted and he finished 37th.\nFirst half.\nOn lap 33, rain returned to the area, and brought out the yellow flag. The race was slowed and run under the yellow flag for about the next 28 laps. Drivers were required to slow down to about an 80 mph pace, and passing was not allowed unless except those cars that entered the pit area.\nThe drizzling stopped, and the green flag came back out on the 61st lap. Only a few laps later, the yellow flag came out again when Wilbur Shaw (driving relief for Phil Pardee) wrecked spectacularly in turn three. The car leaped over the outside wall, and down the embankment. Shaw was uninjured, and walked back to the pits, ready to relieve another driver. While the crash was being cleaned up, more rain began to fall, and the yellow remained out for several minutes more.\nBy lap 70, the rain had stopped and the green flag was back out with Billy Arnold still leading. Ralph Hepburn was running second, Tony Gulotta third, Russ Snowberger fourth, and Fred Frame fifth. Bill Cummings dropped out after completing 70 laps due to an oil leak. On lap 94, Cummins took over the car of Deacon Litz. Also dropping out early with an oil leak was Louis Meyer (28 laps). He got back in the race on lap 73, taking over as relief for Myron Stevens.\nBilly Arnold continued to lead at the halfway point.\nSecond half.\nLouis Schneider made his first and only pit stop on lap 106, taking on gasoline and oil, as well as changing the right rear tire. After surviving a spectacular crash in the first half, Wilbur Shaw was back in the race on lap 118, this time driving a stint of relief for Jimmy Gleason.\nAfter leading 155 laps, Billy Arnold crashed on lap 162. In turn four, Arnold spun, and lost a wheel. He was hit by the car of Luther Johnson. Arnold's car burst into flames, and hit the concrete wall. It slid for about 200 feet, and Arnold and his riding mechanic Spider Matlock were thrown from the machine. A wheel from Arnold's wrecked car bounced over the wall and across the street, striking and killing an 11-year-old boy playing in his yard. Johnson's car flipped over, but he was not seriously injured.\nLouis Schneider took the lead after Arnold's crash. Five laps later Tony Gulotta crashed in nearly the same spot as Arnold. Gulotta's car slid into the inside wall, then bounced up to the outside guardrail, ripping a portion of the barrier out, Neither Gulotta nor his riding mechanic were seriously injured.\nWith 30 laps to go, Schneider and second place Bill Cummings were nose-to-tail, battling for the lead. Cummings had taken over the car of Deacon Litz. Cummings hit the wall in the south short chute on lap 177, leaving Schneider all alone out in front. Schneider led the final 39 laps en route to victory, and won by 43.19 seconds over second place Fred Frame. At the time, it was the second-closest margin of victory in Indianapolis 500 history.\nPolesitter Russ Snowberger was one of three drivers in the top five to complete the race without relief help. The car of Myron Stevens, with Louis Meyer driving relief for most of the race, charged from 35th starting position to 4th place, a remarkable gain of 31 positions at the finish.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie"

        "title": "1930 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 18th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday, May 30, 1930. The race was part of the 1930 AAA Championship Car season.\nPole position winner Billy Arnold took the lead on lap 3, and led the entire rest of the race. He led a total of 198 laps (all consecutive), which stands as an all-time Indianapolis 500 race record. Arnold was accompanied by riding mechanic Spider Matlock.\nArnold was the first driver to complete the entire 500 miles in under five hours (over 100 mph average speed) without relief help. Pete DePaolo finished the 1925 race in under five hours, but used a relief driver for 21 laps. Arnold would eventually be named the first member of the prestigious 100 mph Club.\nThe race was marred by the death of Paul Marshall. He was acting as riding mechanic for his brother Cy when their car hit and flipped over the wall. His brother survived with serious injuries.\nRules changes and the \"Junk\" formula.\nThe 1930 race ushered in a series of substantially new engine rules and specifications. The allotted displacement was increased from 91 cu. in. (1.5 L) to 366 cu. in. (6.0 L). Superchargers were banned with the exception of two-cycle engines, and riding mechanics were made mandatory once again. In addition, the traditional mandate of a maximum 33-car field was lifted. This rules package would be in place through 1937.\nContrary to popular belief, the rule changes were not made in response to the stock market crash of 1929. The rules package is sometimes referred to disparagingly as the \"Junk Formula\" or the \"Junkyard,\" and a common misconception is that it was implemented in order to dumb down the cars and maintain full fields during the Great Depression.\nSpeedway president Eddie Rickenbacker had decided to make the changes in order to lure back the passenger car manufacturers, and make the cars on the track more resemble those sold to the motoring public. Rickenbacker's desire was to move away from the supercharged, specialized racing machines that had taken over the Speedway through the 1920s. It was his vision at the time to bring the Speedway back to its origins and roots as a \"proving ground\" for the passenger car industry. Upon announcing the rule changes, he was quoted as saying, \"Even a Model T can win.\" The rule changes were in fact being laid out as early as 1928, and were approved by the AAA Contest Board in early January 1929.\nPractice.\nThe deadline for entries to be submitted was midnight on May 1. The track was made available for practice a couple days later, with the first car taking to the track on or around Tuesday May 6. Most cars did not arrive at the Speedway until the second full week, with activity picking up mid-month.\nBy Monday May 19, a total of ten cars had taken to the track, with Louis Schneider (105 mph) posting the fastest lap thus far. On Tuesday May 20, the focus of attention was on the 201-c.i.d, 16-cylinder, Sampson Special of Louis Meyer. The car was now completed and wheeled out of its garage at the Steinhart Brake Services building. It was cranked up for the first time, and ready to deliver to the Speedway. Back at the track, Shorty Cantlon turned a lap of 109 mph.\nOn Wednesday May 21, Louis Meyer took to the track for the first time, blistering the bricks with a lap of 110.56 mph in the 16-cylinder machine. Meyer immediately established himself as a favorite for the front row. Meanwhile, Harry Hartz, who had not yet taken any laps in his front wheel drive Miller Special, was still expected to qualify come Saturday.\nOn Thursday May 22, Ralph Hepburn (112.20 mph) and Billy Arnold (111.83 mph) took laps in Harry Hartz's Miller Special. They were the two fastest laps thus far for the month. Speculation was growing that Hartz was preparing to hand the car over to either Hepburn or Arnold, but no official arrangement had been announced. As late as Friday night, Hartz was still insisting to the press that he was intending to race the car himself.\nTime trials.\nQualifications was scheduled for five days, spanning from Saturday May 24 through Wednesday May 28. Four-lap qualifying runs were utilized, and cars were allowed up to three attempts. The minimum speed required was 85 mph. Time trials would end each day at sundown.\nSaturday May 24.\nThe first day of time trials was held Saturday May 24, scheduled for 11 a.m. to 7:01 p.m. L. L. Corum was the first car to qualify. Car owner Harry Hartz took the #4 Miller Special out for a shake-down qualifying attempt. After one official lap of 110.429 mph, he parked the car and handed it over to Billy Arnold. Arnold proceeded to win the pole position with a four-lap run of 113.268 mph.\nOne day after smacking the wall, Ernie Triplett qualified sixth. After practicing on Friday at over 111 mph, and being a favorite for the pole position, Louis Meyer fell short of expectations. Meyer qualified second, owing to an ill-conceived gear ratio change the team decided to make on Saturday morning.\nNo major incidents were reported.\nSunday May 25.\nOnly two cars completed qualifying runs on Sunday May 25. Peter DePaolo was forced to change engines after crankshaft damage suffered on Saturday. Tony Gulotta put in the 12th-fastest speed thus far in the field, but as a second day qualifier, lined up in 20th starting position.\nRookie owner/driver Julius C. Slade quit his run after only two laps, then eventually would hand the car over to Roland Free. Rick Decker also pulled in after only two laps.\nMonday May 26.\nThree cars completed qualifying runs on Monday May 26, filling the field to 24 cars. Bill Cummings led the speed chart for the day, with a run of 106.173 mph, the fourth-fastest car in the field. Cummings car arrived late in the day, and he completed his run after 6 p.m., shortly before the track closed for the day. Cummings day was not without incident, as he nearly involved in an accident along with Peter DePaolo as they drove the car to the Speedway grounds.\nFour other drivers took to the track, but failed to complete their runs. Bill Denver quit after two laps. Rick Decker, making his second attempt, blew an engine after completing only one lap. Likewise, Julius C. Slade, also making his second attempt in two days, threw a rod on his final lap. Babe Stapp took to the track just before sundown, but pulled off the track apparently before starting the attempt.\nTuesday May 27.\nSix cars made qualifying attempts on Tuesday May 27, with all six running to completion. Wilbur Shaw led the speed chart for the day, with a four-lap average of 106.132 mph. There were no major incidents reported.\nA day after practicing over 100 mph, Joe Huff did not disappoint, putting in the second-fastest speed of the afternoon. Rick Decker, who threw a rod and blew the engine in his #31 Decker Special on Monday, spent the day working a new engine. Decker made a deal with Fred Clemmons, owner of the #48 Hoosier Pete entry. Clemmons was unable to secure a chassis for his 4-cylinder Hoosier Pete engine, so he allowed Decker to install it in his car. The team expected to be out on the track for Wednesday.\nJuan Gaudino (#52) and Fred Fansin (#53) officially scratched their entries, after they failed to arrive. At the end of the day, the field was filled to 30 cars. About twelve hopefuls remained, looking to qualify on Wednesday.\nWednesday May 28.\nThe final day of qualifications was held on Wednesday May 28, with time trials officially ending at sundown (7:04 p.m.) A total of eight cars managed to qualify for the race bringing the field to 38 cars. With an entry list featuring as many as 46-47 possible qualifiers, a total of four failed to qualify, and three cars never arrived. No cars were bumped or \"crowded out.\"\nDeacon Litz was the fastest qualifier for the day, with a run of 105.755 mph. After two failed attempts, Rick Decker finally made the field, after he finished installation of the Hoosier Pete engine. Fred Roberts and Rollin May failed to complete their attempts. Roberts threw a rod, and May was too slow to meet the 80 mph minimum speed. Doc MacKenzie never made it out to the track, and Sam Greco threw a rod with only thirty minutes left in the day.\nRace recap.\nFirst half.\nLouis Meyer in his 16-cylinder Miller grabbed the lead at the start, out-dueling polesitter Billy Arnold on the first lap. Meyer led laps 1 and 2, then Arnold took the lead on lap 3. Arnold would not relinquish the lead the rest of the afternoon.\nOn the grid, Rick Decker's engine failed to crank, and he did not start the race. When the crew finally got his car running, it lasted only 8 laps. Chet Gardner was out on the first lap after he spun and brushed the wall on the north end, damaging his left front wheel. Gardner became the first driver in Indy history to drop out of the race without completing a single lap.\nA huge crash broke out on the leader's 23rd lap. Fred Roberts (driving relief for Pete DePaolo) lost control and crashed in turn three. He collected the car of Deacon Litz, who suffered a broken arm. Litz's riding mechanic Lloyd Barnes suffered a cut to the head. The cars of Johnny Seymour, Babe Stapp, Lou Moore, and Marion Trexler also got caught up in the incident. Stapp's car rode up the wall, but he was not seriously injured. Jimmy Gleason's car suffered damage driving through the debris, and he drove back to the pits. He dropped out with what was discovered to be broken timing gears.\nAfter leading early, Louis Meyer was forced to make a pit stop on lap 22 to repair a broken throttle connection. He lost over four minutes in the pits, and dropped as far down as 13th place. He returned to the track, and started charging back up the standings.\nOn the leader's 31st lap, Cy Marshall wrecked in turn three. The driver was pinned under the wreckage, but survived. His brother, riding mechanic Paul Marshall, was thrown from the car, and died of a fractured skull.\nSecond half.\nBilly Arnold won over second place Shorty Cantlon by a margin of over seven minutes (about 4 laps). Arnold was not challenged by any of the other competitors in the second half. During a pit stop on lap 111, Arnold did not request relief help, and managed to drive the entire 500 miles without relief.\nArnold led a total of 198 laps (laps 3–200) to set an all-time Indianapolis 500 record for most total laps led (198), and most consecutive laps led (198).\nSecond place Shorty Cantlon was relieved by Herman Schurch for laps 97 through 151.\nLouis Meyer worked his way back into the top five by lap 140, but was unable to close the gap on Arnold. Meyer held fourth place over the final 50 laps, and finished sixteen minutes behind.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nNote: Cars not finishing were awarded positions in the order in which they left the track, regardless of lap count\nChet Miller.\nOne of the most famous nostalgic stories of Indianapolis 500 lore occurred with driver Chet Miller during the 1930 race. Just short of the mid-way point, Miller was in for a pit stop in his Fronty-Ford. The car, which was made up mostly of Model T parts, was discovered to have a broken right front spring. Race officials would not let Miller return to the track until repairs were made, so the crew began a search for suitable replacement parts.\nWithin a short time, the crew spotted an unattended Model T, that ostensibly belonged to a spectator, parked nearby in the infield. With the owner nowhere in sight, the crew proceeded to remove the spring they needed, and subsequently installed it on Miller's race car sitting in the pit area. After a stop of over 41 minutes, Miller was back out on the track with the borrowed spring, and drove to a 13th-place finish.\nFollowing the race, with the vehicle's owner still not located, the crew went back to the infield and re-installed the spring on the unknown spectator's Model T. It is believed that the owner of the car was never aware of the entire situation."

The World Championships have taken place every non-Olympic year since 1970 and officially included paracanoe events since 2010; since 2012, paracanoe-specific editions of this event (named ICF Paracanoe World Championships) have been held in Summer Paralympic years.\nPrior to November 2008, canoe sprint was known as flatwater racing.\nExplanation of events.\nCanoe sprint competitions are broken up into canoe (C), an open canoe with a single-blade paddle, or in kayaks (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be , , , or long. When a competition is listed as a C-2 500 m event as an example, it means two people are in a canoe competing at a distance.\nParacanoe competitions are contested in either a va'a (V), an outrigger canoe (which includes a second pontoon) with a single-blade paddle, or in a kayak (as above). All international competitions are held over 200 metres in single-man boats, with three event classes in both types of vessel for men and women depending on the level of an athlete's impairment.

        "text": "Jason King (born 21 March 1981) is a sports administrator who currently works for the NRL. King is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 2000s and 2010s. A New South Wales State of Origin representative front row forward, King played his club football in Sydney for the Northern Eagles and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, with whom he won the 2008 NRL Premiership. He also represented City Origin.\nEarly and personal life.\nKing was born in the Sydney suburb of Frenchs Forest. He became a Manly-Warringah junior rugby league footballer. King attended St Augustine's College in Brookvale graduating in the Class of 1998 being the winner of the prestigious Aggregate Cup awarded annually by the college to the student who excels in Study, Conduct and Sport. Jason is now a husband, father of 3, and uncle to many kids, including Ava Gray.\nPlaying career.\n2000s.\nKing made his National Rugby League debut from the bench for the Northern Eagles in a 42–14 loss to the Brisbane Broncos at the NorthPower Stadium in Gosford on 1 September in Round 26 of the 2001 NRL season. In 2002, King became a permanent figure in the Northern Eagles team, playing 22 games for the season and scoring two tries. He scored his first try in the top grade in a 36–12 win over the Canberra Raiders in Round 6 in Gosford.\nFrom the 2003 NRL season, the Northern Eagles were no more and the Manly-Warringah club was back in the premiership (the Northern Eagles had been the result of an uneasy merger between Manly and their local rivals the North Sydney Bears). By this time King had cemented his place in the side and would remain with Manly for the remainder of his career.\nAfter lean times with the Northern Eagles and in the first couple of seasons at Manly, things turned around at the club under the coaching of former Sea Eagles Australian international Des Hasler. After not appearing in the finals since 1998, Manly were back in the picture in 2005, though their season ended with a 46–22 loss to traditional rivals Parramatta in the Qualifying Final.\nKing's form in 2005 saw him gain his first selection for City Origin. He was selected on the bench as City defeated Country Origin 29–22 at the Oakes Oval in Lismore. King would also play for City Origin in 2006 and 2007.\nManly were one of the form teams of the 2007 NRL season and qualified for their first Grand Final since 1997. King's first Grand Final experience was soured as the Manly club were defeated 34-8 by the Melbourne Storm.\nManly, with Jason King forming a strong front row rotation with test forward Brent Kite and former Newcastle Knights prop Josh Perry, maintained their form in the 2008 NRL season and the Grand Final would again see the Sea Eagles come up against Melbourne. This time however Manly-Warringah were in superlative form after easily accounting for St. George Illawarra and New Zealand Warriors in the Qualifying and Preliminary Finals. The 2008 NRL Grand Final would see Manly win by a record margin of 40–0 over Melbourne. Despite playing on the bench in the Grand Final win over Melbourne, King was later voted Rugby League Players Association clubman of the year\nKing then went on to play in the front row in Manly's 28–20 win in the 2009 World Club Challenge over Super League champions the Leeds Rhinos at the Elland Road stadium in Leeds, England.\n2010s.\nIn the 2010 season, King was appointed co-captain of Manly alongside Jamie Lyon. King's form improved during 2010 to the point where he was the 18th man for the New South Wales Origin team for Game 2 of the 2010 State of Origin series, and made his Origin debut in the front row in Game 3 of the series at the Telstra Stadium in Sydney. His form continued for the season despite the patchy form of the Sea Eagles. Unfortunately for King injury ruled him out of the Australian Kangaroos train on squad for the 2010 Four Nations tournament.\nOn 15 May 2011, King was named in the New South Wales Origin team for game 1 of the 2011 series at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane where Queensland defeated The Blues 16–12. This would prove to be the final State of Origins game of King's career.\nDespite a strong start to the 2011 NRL season, a late season injury forced King to watch from the sidelines as Manly defeated the New Zealand Warriors 24–10 in the 2011 NRL grand final.\nKing returned to the team in 2012 as Manly made their way to the Preliminary Final. An injury interrupted 2013 season saw him play only four games and miss Manly's 26-18 2013 NRL Grand Final loss to the Sydney Roosters.\nKing was still co-captain of Manly-Warringah in the 2014 NRL season, though he played mostly from the bench. King retired at the end of the year after 22 games for the Northern Eagles and 217 games for Manly."

        "title": "Auckland Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Auckland Rugby Union is a New Zealand provincial rugby union. The union was established in 1883 and was originally responsible for the administration of the sport in most of the former Auckland Province, although its boundaries have since shrunk to include only a portion of the Auckland urban area. The union governs the Auckland representative team, which has won New Zealand's first-tier domestic provincial competition 17 times, more than any other team. Their most recent title was the 2018 Mitre 10 Cup Premiership. The union administers all club rugby within its boundaries, including the Gallaher Shield and other senior club rugby, as well as school rugby. Auckland also acts as a primary feeder to the Blues, who play in the Super Rugby competition.\nHistory.\nThe Auckland Rugby Football Union (ARFU) was officially formed in 1883, when it joined the Canterbury, Wellington and Otago unions in the fledgling New Zealand Rugby Football Union.\nAuckland has been the most successful union in New Zealand rugby history, having won a record 16 ITM Cup (and predecessor competition) titles. Auckland also holds the record for the most Ranfurly Shield wins (16), successful defences (148), and longest streak of successful defences (61). All Blacks statistics also reveal the extent of Auckland's influence: of the 1071 players to have worn the national jersey from 1888 to 2008, 133 were born in Auckland, compared to Christchurch (74), Wellington (60) and Dunedin (53).\nIn 1996, with the advent of professional rugby union, Auckland became the host, and primary feeder, to the Blues, known from 1996–99 as the Auckland Blues.\nGolden eras.\nAuckland went undefeated for six seasons from 1897, with victory over the British and Irish Lions in 1904. There was an undefeated run in the early 1920s under Sir Vincent Meredith.\nThe 1960 to 1963 period, known as the Golden Era, was summed up in \"The Golden Years\" written by Don Cameron in 1983. Sir Wilson Whineray, who captained Auckland through those years and the All Blacks in 30 tests from 1957 to 1965, describes the period as one of \"excitement, drama and fervor that transformed Eden Park into an oasis of magic during the winters of 1960, 1961, 1962 and 1963.\" The period from 1982 to 2007 is also regarded as a golden period, with Auckland winning more than half (16 out of 26 ) of all NPC titles and five South Pacific Championship titles during the era and winning the team of the year award at the 1992 Halberg Awards.\nRanfurly Shield years.\nAuckland were the first holders of the Ranfurly Shield in 1902 and have won 153 out of 194 shield matches – the most successful record of any provincial union. Notable periods include from 1905 to 1913, when they defeated 23 successive challenges, 1960 and 1963, when 25 challenges were defeated, 1985 to 1993, when a record 61 were defeated. Auckland most recently held the shield between 2007 and 2008, when 5 challenges were defeated. Players like Andy Haden, Sean Fitzpatrick, John Drake, Olo Brown, Zinzan and Robin Brooke, Gary and Alan Whetton, Michael Jones, Steve McDowall, Grant Fox, Bernie McCahill, Grant Dickson, Mark Carter, Joe Stanley, John Kirwan and Terry Wright were important in Auckland's success in that last period.\nIn 1993, Auckland defeated the British Lions by 23–18 during their tour to New Zealand.\nWith six titles in the 1990s and four in the 2000s, Auckland's domination of the New Zealand rugby landscape continued. The 2007 team was the first since the 1990 side to remain unbeaten in a season and win the Ranfurly Shield and the provincial championship. Players like Kees Meeuws, Keven Mealamu, Ali Williams, Justin Collins, Xavier Rush, Steve Devine, Brad Mika, Ben Atiga, Doug Howlett, Daniel Braid, Brent Ward and Angus Macdonald contributed to that success.\nAuckland' fortunes collapsed when New Zealand Rugby moved to being a professional sport. It was 2018 before an Auckland side once again won the National Provincial Championship.\nHonours.\n1982, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2018\n1987 (shared with Canterbury), 1988, 1989, 1990\n1902–04 (0), 1905–13 (23), 1934–35 (1), 1952 (0), 1959 (2), 1960–63 (25), 1965 (3), 1971 (1), 1972 (0), 1974–76 (10), 1979 (6), 1985–93 (61), 1995–96 (3), 1996–97 (6), 2003–04 (2), 2007–08 (5)\nOther representative teams.\nIn addition to the Men's 1st XV, the ARU has a number of other representative teams for both Men and Women. Their women's team, known as the Auckland Storm, are the most successful women's team in New Zealand.\nClub rugby.\nAmong the earliest founding clubs in Auckland were Grafton (1874), Ponsonby (1874) and College Rifles (1897), Marist (1908), University (1888), Grammar (1914) and Suburbs (1918).\nThe premier competition's championship round was renamed the Gallaher Shield in 1922, in memory of Ponsonby, Auckland and New Zealand player Dave Gallaher who captained the 1905 All Blacks, known as The Originals, before retiring after the tour. He became the sole selector to the Auckland team, leading the side to eight successive Ranfurly Shield wins, before he served on the All Blacks selection committee from 1907 to 1914. He then joined the army at a relatively late age, and was killed in the Passchendaele offensive in 1917 aged 43. His Ponsonby side has dominated the Gallaher Shield, winning it 33 times.\nStructure.\nThe Auckland Rugby Football Union consists of 20 clubs from the Auckland isthmus. The premier competition runs from March to August and is split into three segments: the Waka Nathan Challenge Cup from March to May (primarily a pre-season tournament), the Alan McEvoy Round-Robin, and the Championship Round (finals series).\nThe Waka Nathan Challenge Cup is contested at the beginning of the season in a knockout style competition. Teams play for the cup and a winners prize of $2500. Eight teams compete for the Waka Nathan Cup while the bottom seven teams from the previous year's competition contest the Pollard Cup.\nThe 15 teams entered into the Premier Competition play a 15-week round-robin, played on Saturdays. The team with the highest competition points at the end of this round will be awarded the Alan McEvoy Memorial Trophy which commemorates Alan McEvoy an Auckland rep and All Black Trialist who drowned tragically at Baylys Beach in the early 1950s. To determine this, the bonus points system is used. Teams will be seeded 1-16 after this round. The Fred Allen Trophy is also played for during the round-robin phase. It is similar to the Ranfurly Shield, where it is only up for grabs at home games of the trophy holder. It is not contested in the Championship Round.\nIn the Championship Round the sixteen teams are split into the top and bottom eight. It is played over three weeks. The top eight compete for the Gallaher Shield, named after former Auckland and All Blacks player Dave Gallaher, while the bottom eight compete for the Portola Trophy.\nThe first week is a quarter-finals style format where the top seeded team play the bottom seeded team and the second seeded team play the second to last seeded team etc. The four losers from each group of eight go on to play for the Jubilee Trophy (Gallaher Shield Losers) and the President's Cup (Portola Trophy Losers). The next week is semi-finals and the two winners compete for the four trophies mentioned, with the overall champion being the winner of the Gallaher Shield Final.\nGallaher Shield.\nThe Gallaher Shield is awarded to the winner of the senior premier club rugby competition, for overall club records see Gallaher Shield page.\nSchool competition.\nThe union are one of three organisations (the others being Collegesport and the Secondary Schools Executive Committee) responsible for administering the local secondary school competitions. Notable rugby schools in Auckland include Auckland Grammar School, De La Salle College, Kelston Boys High School, King's College, Mount Albert Grammar School, Sacred Heart College and St Kentigern College. The 1st XV competition is split across three divisions, these being 1A, 1B and 1C. In addition to the 1st XV competition there a number of lower-grade (non-1st XV) and girls competitions.\nSupporters.\nThe Auckland Rugby Union Supporters Club (ARUSC) was established in 1976 after a meeting between ARFU administration and a group of supporters. The club's emblem is the \"Flying Elephant\", which was agreed upon after a competition to find a mascot was found. The winner of the competition was Mr J.E. Hannan. The supporters club is currently located under the North (ASB) Stand at Eden Park.\nThe ARUSC also has the Junior Rugby Foundation (JRF) to provide education, assistant and support for the promotion and development of participation by young people in rugby within the areas governed by the ARFU. Recent JRF bursary recipients include Liaki Moli, Sean Polwart and Tyrone Ngaluafe.\nStadium.\nAuckland play their home matches at Eden Park, and have done so since 1925. The ground opened in 1900 and also is used for cricket. Eden Park has the largest crowd capacity of any New Zealand sporting venue, with a capacity of 50,000 for rugby matches.\nAll Blacks.\nThis is a list of players who have represented New Zealand from the Auckland representative rugby union team. Players are listed by the decade they were first selected in and players in bold are current All Blacks."

A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative forward, he played his club football for the Canberra Raiders, Newcastle Knights (with whom he won the 2001 NRL Premiership) and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles.\nEarly life.\nKennedy was born in Casino, New South Wales, Australia.\nKennedy played First XV rugby at St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill when he transferred to grade 12 from Casino High School, and was selected in the Australian Schoolboys side. He switched to rugby league, playing for the Casino Cougars.\nPlaying career.\nKennedy started his post-school career playing rugby union for three years with the Manly Marlins in the Shute Shield. His NRL career started with the Canberra Raiders in 1996 where he was named the club's Rookie of the Year. He had four seasons with the club though the 1999 season was coloured by questions whether he had agreed to terms with the Newcastle Knights before the mid season anti-tampering deadline. He was first selected for New South Wales in 1999 and went on to play 13 State of Origins.\nIn 1999, Kennedy and Brandon Pearson were sent home from training after being involved in a drinking session. There were claims that the pair had taken drugs, and Pearson confessed to taking an illicit substance, but Kennedy claimed to have spat the tablet out. Subsequent drug tests for both returned negative.\nKennedy saw premiership victory during his five-year stint with the Newcastle Knights from 2000 and was selected to national honours while playing for the Knights. He debuted for Australia in 2000 when the Kangaroos played Fiji in the World Cup tournament.\nKennedy scored a try in Newcastle's 2001 NRL Grand Final victory. At the end of the 2001 NRL season, he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. In 2011, 10 years after Newcastle's grand final victory, Kennedy spoke to the media at The Once a Knight reunion lunch recalling his memories of the 2001 final. Kennedy said ‘'They came into the game under a shitload of pressure but for us, it was just a good time and a heap of fun. Parra were shitting themselves and we were having a good time\".\nHe missed representative opportunities in 2003 due to injury and surgery.\nIn his final seasons 2005–06 he captained the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. He appeared in six out of the seven Australian Test matches in 2005. Along with former club teammate and friend Andrew Johns, Kennedy finished his international career in the 2006 Anzac Test.\nHis final club match was Manly's 2006 Semi Final loss St George Illawarra at Aussie Stadium."

        "title": "2006 FIFA World Cup seeding",
        "text": "To calculate the seeding for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, FIFA used the FIFA World Rankings in combination with performances of national teams in the two previous World Cups.\nPoints were allocated on the basis of 32 for the best achieving of the 32 qualifiers for 2006 FIFA World Cup in each of the five fields considered, down to one for the lowest ranking.\nThe seedings table uses these points obtained from the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2002 FIFA World Cup averaged in a 1:2 ratio respectively, added to the average number of points derived from the World Rankings at three given dates (at ratio 1:1:1), December 2003, December 2004, and November 2005. This generates a view of how well the teams have performed over the last ten years (since the rankings in 2003 include results from eight years previous to that) with a specific focus on how the teams have performed in the FIFA World Cup on previous occasions. Significant differences between this ranking of the teams and the official FIFA rankings at the time of the draw can be seen for Czech Republic, Germany and South Korea (ρ=0.87).\nSystem change.\nUnlike the 2002 FIFA World Cup seeding system which used performances of national teams in the three previous World Cups, this seeding system only used the last two. Had Denmark not failed to qualify they would have been seeded at the expense of Argentina.\nProgress of seeded teams.\nAll 8 seeded teams qualified for the knockout stages of the tournament, but France and Mexico failed to win their groups, and so had to play other seeded teams in the second round. Mexico lost to Argentina, and France beat Spain, so while Spain and Mexico were eliminated earlier than the seedings would have predicted, Ukraine and Portugal went farther than the seedings predicted, Portugal going on to reach the semi-finals."
