        "text": "The 2008 Phillips 66 Big 12 men's basketball tournament was the 2008 edition of the Big 12 Conference's championship tournament held at the Sprint Center in Kansas City from March 13 until March 16, 2008. It was the 12th Big 12 tournament in the series. Texas and Kansas shared the regular season title, with Texas receiving the top seed in the tournament due to its win over Kansas earlier in the season. The top four seeds, including the two regular season champs, Oklahoma, and Kansas State automatically advanced to the quarterfinal round.\nThe first round featured several close games, with a combined 29-point margin of victory for the four matchups. Oklahoma State upset Texas Tech in a game that flip-flopped throughout, and the 12-seed Colorado Buffaloes defeated the 5-seed Baylor Bears in double overtime. This was both the first double-overtime game in tournament history and the first 12-seed win in tournament history. Texas A&amp;M and Nebraska both won their games against Iowa State and Missouri, respectively.\nRegular season and tournament seeding.\nTo kick off the beginning of the 2007–2008 Big 12 men's basketball season a poll of the head coaches of the Big 12 men's basketball programs found that Kansas was the preseason favorite to win the conference for a second consecutive year and receiving 10 of 12 first place votes. In second place was Texas, the 2006–2007 season's runner-up for both the regular season title and tournament title. Texas A&amp;M was dubbed for third place and received the remaining 2 first place votes. Aggies head coach Billy Gillespie left at the end of the previous season to take up the head coaching position at Kentucky. Another important coaching change came when Bob Huggins left Kansas State after one season to return to his alma mater, West Virginia. Nonetheless, KSU was selected for fourth place in the poll, the school's highest ever selection in the conference pre-season poll. Missouri and Oklahoma tied for fifth place while Oklahoma State and Texas Tech came in seventh and eighth place, respectively. Baylor, Nebraska, Iowa State, and Colorado took the final four spots, respectively. With identical conference records of 13–3, the Texas Longhorns and the Kansas Jayhawks share the 2008 regular season title. Because Texas won the head-to-head game with Kansas, they claim the No. 1 seed for the tournament.\n† – Denotes Tournament Champion.\n * – Denotes Regular Season Champion\n1 – Texas Tech and Missouri were invited to the 2008 College Basketball Invitational but declined the offer.\nSource:\nBracket.\nSource:\nGame summaries.\nFirst round.\nTexas Tech vs. Oklahoma State.\nJames Anderson led the Cowboys with 18 points and eight rebounds, including a crucial 12-foot jump shot with 45 seconds left to increase his team's lead to 73–70. The game was close throughout, with each team holding the lead for a good share of the game. Texas Tech's Alan Voskuil led his team in scoring with 19 points, but as Red Raider's coach Pat Knight said, \"We missed eight lay-ups in the second half, missed four out of five free throws. We made a lot of dumb mistakes. It comes from being casual... It was a hard-fought game offensively and defensively. We just made too many dumb mistakes.\" Texas Tech had recently suffered a 109–51 loss to Kansas, which set a school record for largest loss deficit. Knight, however, said, \"This is probably the most disappointed I've been because this was a game we were in.\" The Red Raiders briefly took the lead in the second half, but a Byron Eaton three put the Cowboys back in the lead.\nBaylor vs. Colorado.\nAfter gaining the lead early, Colorado managed to hold off a 2nd-half Baylor rally, taking the game into overtime twice. With the win, the Buffaloes became the first 12-seed to win a game in the tournament's eleven-year history. The game was also the first double-overtime game in tournament history. Colorado had a 15-point lead in the second half, only to see Baylor go on a 14–1 run to get back in it. With several botched possessions and failed chances to win on both sides, the game went into overtime twice. Baylor came within two during the second OT, but Kevin Rogers missed two free throws and Colorado quickly scored. A few late free throws added to the lead and gave CU the win. Baylor (21–10) had just completed one of the best seasons in the school's history, with hopes to gain an invite to the national tournament, but the loss to Colorado placed these hopes in doubt. Colorado shot 72% from the field in the first half, setting another tournament record for field goal percentage in a half.\nNebraska vs. Missouri.\nAleks Maric led Nebraska with 17 points and 13 rebounds in a win over Missouri. Missouri came to within one point with under two minutes left, but series of Nebraska free throws, along with a blocked shot by Maric in the final minute, took Nebraska to the next round. Missouri (16–16) suffered this season after a Columbia fight left one of its star players with a broken jaw. They were ahead near the end of the first half, but the Cornhuskers went on a 10–3 run late and scored at the buzzer to carry the halftime lead, 28–30.\nTexas A&amp;M vs. Iowa State.\nIn a physical game dominated by defensive play, Texas A&amp;M scored their second-ever Big 12 tournament win in history. The Cyclones were held to 27% shooting from the field throughout, and their high-scorer Craig Brackins' 20 points and 12 rebounds were not enough to carry the team. The Aggies made 43% of their field goals, and were led by Donald Sloan, whose mother had died earlier that day, and Dominique Kirk with 12 points each. A&amp;M was sitting on the bubble this year, needing some tournament wins to secure a spot in the NCAA championship tournament. With a combined 42 points in the first half, this game had the lowest scoring half in tournament history since 2003. Also, the combined margin of victory for all the tournament's first-round game was 29, the second lowest in history. The only Big 12 tournament with a lower combined margin of victory in the first round was 2006 with 28 points.\nQuarterfinals.\nOklahoma State vs. Texas.\nA late three put the Cowboys ahead at the half, but D. J. Augustin led the Longhorns on a 14–0 run to start the second half, putting OSU far behind. Damion James held the lead in stats for Texas with 23 points and 11 rebounds. The Cowboys, with Ibrahima Thomas' 19 points, had rallied from 7 points behind to gain the lead at halftime, but went the first eight minutes of the second half without a field goal. A late rally pulled them to within three, but Texas managed to hold them off and win by seven.\nColorado vs. Oklahoma.\nAfter going scoreless for the first five minutes, Colorado fought back, holding star Sooner forward Blake Griffin to four points and keeping the game close. Other Sooners, such as Tony Crocker, Longar Longar, and Taylor Griffin, managed to make up the difference, scoring a combined 33 points in what was a largely defensive game. Both teams made only about a third of their shots from the field. Colorado's Richard Roby lead both teams in scoring with 18 points, and in rebounds with 10, and he broke a school point record with 2,001 total for his career. However, this along with Colorado's slow play, waiting the shot clock out for each possession, was not enough to keep the Sooners from advancing to meet Texas in the semifinals.\nKansas State vs. Texas A&amp;M.\nDominique Kirk hit five 3-pointers and had 19 points, and Josh Carter hit two free throws with 7 seconds left to help Texas A&amp;M hold off third-seeded Kansas State 63–60.\nTexas A&amp;M (24–9) shot 50 percent—a huge improvement from its first-round game against Iowa State—and didn’t let anyone besides Michael Beasley do much of anything, winning its second straight conference tournament game after going 1–11 the previous 11 years.\nBeasley had 25 points and nine rebounds, but Bill Walker (10 points) was the only other double-figures scorer for Kansas State (20–11), which still got into the NCAA tournament despite the loss.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nMost Outstanding Player – Brandon Rush, \"Kansas\""

Its winner received the Big East Conference's automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament. It is a single-elimination tournament with four rounds and the four highest seeds received byes in the first round. The 12 Big East teams with the best conference records were invited to participate. Georgetown, the Big East regular season winner, received the number one seed in the tournament.\nThe first round of the tournament saw no upsets, as each of the higher seeds won their games. However, the second round had three of the four lower seeds winning their games. In the semi-finals, number one seed, Georgetown, easily won, while the seventh seed, Pittsburgh, won in a close game. The two teams played each other for the tournament championship and Pittsburgh was victorious, winning the conference's automatic bid. After the tournament, eight of the teams that participated were invited to the NCAA Tournament. It was Pittsburgh's second Big East tournament championship.\nBefore the tournament.\nBefore the beginning of the season the league's coaches voted Georgetown, the 2006-07 Big East regular season and tournament winner, and Louisville to share the conference title. Additionally, it was decided that each team's conference schedule would expand from 16 to 18 games so all of the teams would play each other. Fifteen Big East teams reached the beginning of their conference schedules with winning records, with four teams having only one loss and three others with only two losses. The out of conference schedule for the league included four teams playing in the inaugural \"Big East/SEC Invitational\", where they went 3–1, and two teams beating top–10 ranked teams. At the end of conference play, Georgetown, who was ranked tenth in the Coaches Poll, won the regular season title. Six teams ended the season ranked, while eight ended with over 20 wins. The top–12 teams in the standings were invited to the tournament.\nTournament.\nSeeding.\nThe twelve teams that were invited to the tournament were seeded according to their records:\nFirst round.\nThe first round of the tournament was played on March 12 with each of the higher seeds winning.

Although Syracuse held a one-point lead at half-time, Villanova took an early lead in the second half and never trailed again, winning 82–63. In the second game of the day, Providence played West Virginia. The teams both struggled throughout the game with both having scoreless streaks, but West Virginia prevailed in the end to win 58–53. In the third game of the day Cincinnati played Pittsburgh. Although the teams stayed close throughout, Pittsburgh won the game 70–64. In the final game of the day Marquette played Seton Hall. Marquette won the game by holding Seton Hall scoreless through the last five minutes of the game to finish 67–54.\nSecond round.\nThe second round of the tournament was played on March 13, and three of the four lower seeds won their games. The first game of the day featured Villanova facing the number one seed, Georgetown. Despite top-scorer Roy Hibbert not scoring the entire game, Georgetown won the game, 82–63, tying a tournament record with 17 three-point field goals. In the second game West Virginia played Connecticut. Although it was close for the majority of the game, West Virginia's six point half-time lead was enough to win the game, 78–72, the first upset of the tournament. In the third game Pittsburgh faced Louisville, a team they had knocked out of the tournament the previous two years. Although Pittsburgh had the largest lead in regulation at eight points, the game was tied at the end of the second half and it continued to overtime. Pittsburgh finally pulled away in the overtime period, and won 76–69. In the final game of the round, Marquette played Notre Dame. Notre Dame had a six-point lead at half-time even though conference Player of the Year, Luke Harangody, had only played for seven minutes. However, Marquette's Jerel McNeal, who had 21 points in the team's first win, scored 28 to lead Marquette to an 89–79 victory.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals began with top-seed Georgetown facing West Virginia. The game was close early, but five minutes before half-time, Georgetown went on a scoring run and led 33–21 at the half. West Virginia came back and brought their deficit to six points halfway through the second period, however Georgetown never relinquished their lead. Led by Hibbert's 25 points in his double-double, Georgetown won 72–55 to return to the championship game for the second consecutive year. In the second game of the day, Marquette faced Pittsburgh. Early in the game Pittsburgh took a 12-point lead and kept a double-digit lead throughout the half. Marquette cut their deficit during the second period and had the score within three points with a minute remaining in the game. However, Pittsburgh kept their lead with free throw shooting and won the game 68–61, advancing to the championship game for the seventh time in eight years.\nChampionship game.\nPittsburgh faced Georgetown in a repeat of the championship game of the 2007 tournament. Throughout the first half the lead changed hands six times, with Georgetown having the largest lead of six points. Pittsburgh, however, led at half-time by three. Although Georgetown would bring their deficit to two early in the second half, Pittsburgh never relinquished the lead after half-time. Pittsburgh's Sam Young led the team with a double-double to help secure their win, the school's second overall and first for coach Jamie Dixon.\nAwards.\nAfter the championship game Sam Young, who led Pittsburgh to the win and led the tournament in scoring with 80 points, was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. Young was joined by his teammate Levance Fields, Georgetown's Jessie Sapp and Roy Hibbert, West Virginia's Joe Alexander, and Marquette's Jerel McNeal to the All-Tournament Team.\nAfter the tournament.\nIn addition to Pittsburgh's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, seven other conference teams were given at-large bids in the field, tying the conference record of eight teams in the tournament. Georgetown got the highest seed of the conference with a 2 seed and Louisville got a 3 seed. Both Pittsburgh and Connecticut were given 4 seeds and Notre Dame got a 5 seed. Marquette was given a 6 seed and West Virginia got a 7 seed. Finally, Villanova was given a 12 seed and was the final at-large team invited to the tournament. Although Syracuse was not invited to the NCAA Tournament, they were the only team from the conference invited to the 2008 National Invitation Tournament."

The tournament was held at Bolton Wanderers' Reebok Stadium, Bolton, England, between 5–8 June 2008.\nJames Wade won the tournament; his first UK Open title, and his third major championship inside 12 months. He defeated American Gary Mawson in the final 11–7.\nFormat.\nAs in previous years, eight regional UK Open events were staged across the UK where players winning were collated into the UK Order Of Merit. The top 128 players in the list, who played a minimum of three events (plus ties) won a place at the final stages.\nThe final UK Open Order of Merit qualifiers (146) were also joined by 32 Holsten qualifiers from pub tournaments throughout the UK. The Holsten qualifiers and the players outside the top 32 of the UK Open Order of Merit began the tournament on the Thursday night. They played down to 32 players, and they were joined by the top 32 of the UK Open Order of Merit the following night, to provide the competition's last 64.

This provides no protection for the top players, who are usually seeded to avoid each other in early rounds. Raymond van Barneveld and Phil Taylor, the top two in the PDC rankings respectively, met at the quarter-final stage for the third successive year, with the Dutchman coming out on top each occasion, this time 10-9. In addition, Adrian Lewis and Wayne Mardle - two players who played in the 2008 Premier League - played as early as the third Round, the last 64 stage.\nVan Barneveld, who had won the tournament for the previous two years went out in the semi-finals to Gary Mawson, which was the Dutchman's first loss at the Reebok Stadium in the event. It also meant that Phil Taylor now overtook him to regain the top spot in the PDC Order of Merit/world rankings, as van Barneveld had failed to defend the £30,000 from the UK Open two years ago.\nEarlier in the tournament, Phil Taylor threw his fourth nine dart leg in six years in the UK Open, during a 9-1 victory over Jamie Harvey in the fourth round. In his Fifth round match against Wesley Newton, Taylor achieved the highest televised 3 dart average (to date) of 114.53 surpassing Darryl Fitton's record (114.15) in the International Darts League 2004 against Davy Richardson.\nThe semi-final line-up contained only one player from the United Kingdom for the first time it the tournament's six-year history.

Twenty-three boxers from 15 nations competed.\nThis competition saw one of the most controversial bouts in Olympic history, when Frenchman Roger Brousse and defending Olympic champion Harry Mallin from Great Britain faced each other in the quarterfinals. Near the end of the fight Mallin complained to the Belgian referee that Brousse had bitten him. Mallin showed the referee bite marks on his chest and shoulder. His protest was overruled by the judges and the bout was awarded to the French boxer on points (2:1). An appeal launched by Swedish official and IOC member Oscar Söderlund brought forward medical evidence that Mallin had been bitten. Manuel Gallardo also came forward with a complaint about being bitten by Brousse in their bout. Brousse was disqualified and Mallin became the winner, even though the jury declared that the foul had not been intentional. French fans had to be restrained by the police from charging the ring.\nTwo days later the French crowd were still incensed when Mallin boxed in the final against John Elliott. Brousse came in his boxing attire and his fans lifted him up into the ring. Only after intervention by the police were the two British opponents able to contest the final."

        "text": "The 1984 Winter Olympics – officially known by the International Olympic Committee as the XIV Olympic Winter Games – were a winter multi-sport event held between 8 and 19 February 1984 in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (currently Bosnia and Herzegovina). A total of 1,272 athletes, representing a record 49 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), competed in 39 events across 10 disciplines of 6 sports. The official program was the same as that of the 1980 Winter Olympics, with the addition of a 20-kilometer event in women's cross-country skiing. Disabled skiing was featured for the first time as an Olympic demonstration sport.\nThe 117 Olympic medals in dispute at these Games were awarded to athletes from 17 NOCs. The athletes from the Soviet Union collected 25 medals and secured their NOC a top spot in the overall medal count, ahead of East Germany (24 medals) and Finland (13 medals). East Germany, however, topped the gold medal count with nine medals, three more than those won by Soviet athletes. Finland, the United States and Sweden followed with four gold medals each. The host delegation won the nation's first medal at the Winter Olympics, through alpine skier Jure Franko's silver in the men's giant slalom event.\nAmerican skier Phil Mahre, runner-up in 1980, won the slalom event and saw his twin brother Steve secure the silver medal. In biathlon, Eirik Kvalfoss of Norway and Peter Angerer of West Germany won six medals between them, each securing a complete set. \nThe Nordic countries displayed their strength in the cross-country skiing competition: from the 24 medals in dispute, 17 were won by athletes from Finland (8), Sweden (5), and Norway (4). Finnish skier Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen won four medals, including a gold medal sweep in the three individual cross-country distances, becoming the most successful athlete at these Games. In the men's section, Gunde Svan of Sweden also won four medals, though one less gold than Hämäläinen. Katarina Witt, a young figure skater from East Germany, narrowly defeated the reigning World champion, Rosalynn Sumners of the United States, to collect the first of two successive Olympic gold medals. The British ice dancing pair, Torvill and Dean, took the gold medal after giving performances that earned them not only the first-ever perfect scores (6.0) in Olympic ice dancing compulsories, but also a complete set of perfect artistic impression scores in the free program.\nThe Soviet Union dominated the ice hockey competition, winning every match to take their sixth Olympic gold in eight Winter Games. East German sledders fully demonstrated their prowess at the Trebević track. Wolfgang Hoppe and Dietmar Schauerhammer clinched gold in both bobsleigh events, while Bernhard Lehmann and Bogdan Musioł secured both silvers. Led by Steffi Martin, who won the first of her two back-to-back Olympic titles, East German lugers swept the women's singles medals. This show of strength was also observed in the women's speed skating, where East German athletes grabbed nine of the twelve medals in dispute. Four of these were won by Karin Enke (matching the total tallies of Hämäläinen and Svan), and three by Andrea Schöne – in direct competition with Enke. Speed skater Gaétan Boucher won three of Canada's four medals in Sarajevo, including two golds.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes that won at least two gold medals or at least three total medals are listed below."

Wilson played three games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens during the 1956–57 season. His son, Carey Wilson, also played in the NHL, and his grandson Colin was most recently a member of the Colorado Avalanche of the NHL.\nCredited with recruiting Swedish hockey stars Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson to the Winnipeg Jets of the World Hockey Association, Wilson is said to be the man most responsible for pioneering the arrival of European hockey players to North America. He later worked as the team doctor for the Jets and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. He died on March 22, 2011, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nHockey career.\nWilson played three games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens during the 1956–57 season. He mainly played in the minor leagues, and retired in 1960.\nPost-playing career.\nWilson retired from hockey as a result of injuries to his shoulders and knees. He then enrolled in pre-medical courses at the University of Manitoba, also coaching their hockey team. Specializing in orthopedics, Wilson was given a grant in 1973 to study the subject, along with physical education, at an institute in Stockholm, Sweden. As part of his research Wilson would study the physiology of hockey players, specifically their heart and lung conditioning. As a result, he was asked by the Winnipeg Jets of the World Hockey Association to watch out for any notable Swedish hockey players. In Stockholm one of Wilson's interns was Anders Hedberg, a hockey player, and he also tested Ulf Nilsson. Wilson informed the Jets of both Hedberg and Nilsson in 1974, and they would join the team that year."

The Netherlands won the third-place match by defeating England 4–3.\nBackground.\nIndia's hosting of the event was put in doubt when the FIH reviewed the progress of the Indian Hockey Federation's \"Promoting Indian Hockey\" program and India's preparation for the championship, and warned that \"satisfactory progress had not been made in either area\". India was warned it could lose the right to host the World Cup unless satisfactory progress was made. It was confirmed on 18 July 2008 that the International Hockey Federation formally awarded the hosting rights to India.\nQualification.\nEach of the continental champions from five confederations and the host nation received an automatic berth. The European confederation received three extra quotas based upon the FIH World Rankings at the completion of the 2008 Summer Olympics. In addition to the three winners of each of the three Qualifiers, the following twelve teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, competed in this tournament.\nCompetition format.\nTwelve teams competed in the tournament with the competition consisting of two rounds. In the first round, teams were divided into two pools of six teams, and play followed round robin format with each of the teams playing all other teams in the pool once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and zero points for a loss. At the end of the pool matches, teams were ranked in their pool according to the following criteria in order:\nFollowing the completion of the pool games, teams placing first and second in each pool advanced to a single elimination round consisting of two semifinal games, a third place playoff and a final. Remaining teams competed in classification matches to determine their ranking in the tournament. During these matches, extra time of 7½ minutes per half was to be played if teams were tied at the end of regulation time. During extra time, play followed golden goal rules with the first team to score declared the winner. If no goals were scored during extra time, a penalty stroke competition was to take place.\nUmpires.\n16 umpires were appointed by the FIH for this tournament. During each match, a video umpire was used to assist the on-field umpires in determining if a goal had been legally scored. The FIH also mandated that on a trial basis during the tournament, each team received the right to refer one decision made by an on-field umpire to the video umpire for assessment. Referrals were only permitted for decisions made within the 23 meter area relating to the award (or non-award) of goals, penalty strokes, and penalty corners. In the event that the referral was upheld, the referring team retained a right of further referral.\nResults.\n\"All times are Indian Standard Time ()\""

Founded in 1877 and incorporated in 1886, it is one of the oldest active tennis clubs and claims to be the oldest lawn tennis club in the United States. Most of the club's present facilities were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992 in recognition of this history.\nDescription.\nThe Seabright Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club is located in eastern Rumson, on more than of land at the junction of Rumson Road and Tennis Court Lane. The clubhouse is located near the northern end of the property, with much of the property given over to tennis courts. The clubhouse was built in 1886 to a design by Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell, and is a Tudor Revival example of a 19th-century casino, or gathering place for entertainment and socialization.\nThe tennis facilities are divided into five groups. Three bands of lawn tennis courts are laid out south of the clubhouse, with a fourth band of hard-surface courts between those and Rumson Road. To the east of these are a fifth group of clay courts. A single court is located just northwest of the clubhouse at the northern edge of the property.\nHistory.\nThe first documented instance of lawn tennis to be played in the United States took place in 1874 on Staten Island. In the wake of this event, several clubs dedicated to the sport were organized. Seabright's exact date of organization is uncertain: it claims a date 1876, but contemporaries have claimed 1877 as the founding date of Seabright and other early tennis clubs. Although it originally also included cricket and archery, interest in those sports waned, and the club's cricket pitch was converted into tennis courts in 1890. The club's historic interest in archery is marked by its logo, which resembles a bullseye.\nThe Seabright Invitational Tournament was a major tennis competition held from 1884 through 1950. It was ended not because of funding, but because the members grew tired of the fuss of organizing the event."

Both of their tee shots were in the fairway on the next hole, the par-4 11th, but with the pond on the left of the green, Mize's avoidant approach shot was about pin-high but well right, about from the hole. Norman then played conservatively to the right fringe, with a putt, sensing a par could win the green jacket.

Its current headquarters is in Brøndby, Copenhagen. \nHistory.\nThe DCF was founded in 1953, at a meeting of 31 clubs in Odense. Cricket in Denmark had previously been organised by the Danish Football Association, a consequence of both sports being introduced by British expatriates. The organisation joined the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1966, as an associate member, and was later also a founding member of the European Cricket Council.\nIn the year 1840, a few Danish high school teachers were on a study visit to England and brought back the basics of the game of cricket to Denmark. Later in the 1860s the English railway engineers who constructed the railway tracks through Denmark founded cricket clubs in the cities of Randers and Odense. Further, the famous Danish fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen mentions in his diary from 1857 that he was playing cricket while visiting Charles Dickens in England and he got an injured finger hitting the ball. Many cricket clubs combined the cricket activities with football which meant that cricket was organized by the Danish Football Association, called Dansk Boldspil Union (DBU)."

France participated in the only Olympic Games in Paris in 1900, the only Olympics that has included cricket, and won the silver medal (although many of the players on the French team were English expatriates).\nIn November 2023, France 24 reported that France Cricket had allegedly provided fabricated data to the International Cricket Council (ICC) in order to access additional funding. An investigation by France 24 found that France Cricket had reported results from \"ghost matches\" which did not actually take place, particularly between women's teams. Allegations were also made that the organisation had mismanaged funds, with former CEO Marjorie Guillaume stating that she had been refused access to the organisation's accounts and that she had been unable to verify over €100,000 in claimed expenditure on equipment."

        "text": "Cricket Hong Kong, China (), previously known as the Hong Kong Cricket Association and Cricket Hong Kong (), is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Hong Kong. Its current headquarters is in So Kon Po, Causeway Bay. Established as the Hong Kong Cricket Association in 1968, CHK is Hong Kong's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member having been admitted as a member of that body since 1969. It is also a member of the Asian Cricket Council.\nHistory of Cricket in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839–42), and it was around this time that the first recorded cricket match was played in the colony; in 1841. Ten years later, the Hong Kong Cricket Club was formed, while in 1866, Interport matches were established against Shanghai. In 1890, a further series of matches were started, against The Straits, and Ceylon. Two years after this, the Hong Kong cricket team was returning from one such match against Shanghai, when the ship they were travelling on, the SS Bokhara, was caught in a typhoon, and sank. All but two members of the cricket team, along with 114 others, drowned.\nAn organised domestic cricket league was first established in the 1903–04 season, and was won during its inaugural year by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. A Second Division was introduced to lower level or newer clubs in 1921–22. In 1966, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) visited Hong Kong for the first time, on their return from a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The Hong Kong Cricket Association was granted associate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1969, and a few years later, the domestic structure was altered, with the First and Second Division being replaced with Sunday and Saturday Leagues, respectively.\nIn 1982, the Hong Kong national cricket team made their first appearance in the ICC Trophy, and finished fifth in their group of eight, recording two wins, against Israel, and Gibraltar. Interport matches continued until 1987, until the final one was played, against Singapore. In 1992, the first Hong Kong Cricket Sixes tournament was contested, and was won by Pakistan.\nBy finishing as runners-up in the 2000 ACC Trophy, Hong Kong qualified for the 2004 Asia Cup. At the 2004 competition, Hong Kong played their first One Day International (ODI) matches, suffering losses to Bangladesh and Pakistan. After finishing as runners-up in the 2006 ACC Trophy, Hong Kong once again qualified for the Asia Cup, where in the 2008 tournament, losing to Pakistan and India.\nHong Kong’s finest moment to date on the international stage came in 2014, with a win over ICC World T20 hosts Bangladesh in Chittagong. Since then Hong Kong have gone on to qualify for the ICC Intercontinental Cup and ICC World Cricket League Championships and have ODI status until at least the 2019 ICC World Cup.\nDuring that period Hong Kong have notched their first One Day International and first-class victories and have reached as high as 10th in the world in T20 Internationals.\nCricket is now one of the fastest growing sports in Hong Kong. The game is spreading beyond the populations of sub-continent or English origin and many Chinese are also taking up the sport. In a few years it is expected to make some good strides.\nRebranding.\nThe HKCA rebranded as Cricket Hong Kong in 2016, as part of a strategy to secure more engagement from Hong Kongers. In 2023, its name was altered to \"Cricket Hong Kong, China\" in line with requirements from the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China to add \"China\" to the name of sporting associations.\nFlagship events by Cricket Hong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong Cricket Sixes.\nThe Hong Kong Sixes are set to make a return in 2017, following a five-year absence from the international calendar. The iconic Hong Kong tournament played at Kowloon Cricket Club was first played in 1992, with the most recent edition taking place in 2012.\nHong Kong T20 Blitz.\nThe Hong Kong T20 Blitz brings the world’s best short form players together with the premier local domestic cricket talent. There is also a focus on developing Associate Cricket, with each team required to select at least one overseas player from a non-full member nation. A total of five overseas players per team will be permitted in the 2017 tournament, up from 3 in a playing XI in 2016.\nThe 2016 event was highlighted by the signing of World Cup-winning Captain Michael Clarke, who also spent time with Hong Kong’s national squad during his stay. His team the Kowloon Cantons were named joint winners with the Woodworm Island Warriors after rain washed out the final. Hung Hom JD Jaguars and Lantau GII Galaxy Riders were the other teams to compete in the inaugural tournament.\nThe full scale of success in the second edition of the DTC Hong Kong T20 Blitz has been revealed, following the release of figures from the live streaming coverage of the event. Full data collected from the tournament generated 11.8 million views across Facebook and YouTube over the five days, obliterating last year's 51,000 over two days and the anticipated target of 1 million. Over 8.4 million of those views were live during the coverage, with the remaining 3.4 million watched the videos on demand. While the majority of viewership came from cricket stronghold markets such as India, the growth in the local Hong Kong market was also notable. A total of 146,000 views in total were from the Territory, up from just 8,000 in the Blitz's opening season. In addition, both weekend days of the tournament were sold out, which resulted in an electric atmosphere both at the ground and during the broadcast.\nThe tournament also made waves in the cricket world, with the Blitz becoming the first major T20 event to be run by an Associate member. Preparations have already begun for the 2018 event with dates to be confirmed following the release of the schedule of the Cricket World Cup qualifiers."

Its principal objective is to incorporate and manage cricket within. Israel along with Denmark, Gibraltar, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy and Scotland founded the European Cricket Council in 1996.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nAs is most often the case, cricket was introduced to Israel by the British. Local enthusiasts managed to keep the game going once the British had left in 1948, but the game was struggling until the mid-1960s, when an influx of Jewish immigrants from cricket playing countries revived the game, mainly South Africa, United Kingdom, and the Indian Subcontinent.Bene Israel Indian Jews played a key role, establishing the nation's first club in Beersheba.\nThe first national league was formed in 1966, which led to the formation of the Israel Cricket Association (ICA) in 1968. The league prospered despite conditions ill-suited to cricket. Games were played on dusty, grass-less football fields, on matting wickets. However, the enthusiasm of the players has overcome these drawbacks.\nICC Membership.\nIsrael became an associate member of the ICC in 1974, with only Pakistan opposing their membership. Israel competed in the first ICC Trophy in 1979, failing to get past the first round. They also failed to progress beyond the first round in the 1982 tournament and 1986 tournament\n21st century.\nIsrael have been playing in Division Two of the European Championships since 2000. ICA has been praised many times for its peace work within Israel; The International Cricket Council, has awarded the Israeli Cricket Association with a top prize for bringing together Jews and Bedouins in the Southern Negev desert through cricket, the award is not the first of its kind for the ICA. They were honoured with a similar prize in 2001. In 2009 the ICA started working with cricketing charity Cricket for Change to introduce cricket to young people from both the Israeli Arab and Jewish communities around the city of Beersheba.\nBoard of directors.\nThe ICA is run by a board of directors who are elected by its members every two years, according to the articles of association of the company.

It is Nepal's representative at the International Cricket Council and remains an associate member since 1996 AD (2053 BS). It is also a member of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).\nThe board was dissolved by the government of Nepal in November 2014 on the grounds of incompetence and a three-member ad hoc committee was established with a new president designated by the government itself.\nIn April 2016, CAN was suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC), on the grounds of government interference in its operations. However the suspension did not prevent Nepal's national teams from participating in ICC tournaments.\nThe ICC welcomed the elections of the board held in September 2019 and formally reinstated the board on a conditional basis on 14 October. On 13 October 2019, the ICC lifted its suspension on the Cricket Association of Nepal.\nDomestic tournaments.\nThe CAN organise following national-level tournaments:\nNational teams.\nNepal's position at the top of the ACC rankings rests on its consistent performance at all levels of competition. Wins in U-19 cricket World Cups against Pakistan, New Zealand, and South Africa have been based on disciplined, error-free cricket.\nSri Lanka's batsman Roy Dias, who took over as coach in 2001, was the architect of Nepal's triumphs and he molded a nation high on enthusiasm and short of experience into a competitive force. A good example of his ability to maximize the skills of his charges was seen in the performance of the U-15 team in the 2006 ACC Elite Cup.: only two of the Nepal squad had ever played any competitive cricket before reaching Malaysia to play the event, two weeks later they had won it.A regime change at the Cricket Association of Nepal has led to the adoption of a more professional approach to development. Greater sponsorship and more focused domestic competitions have been the result. Work has already started on a national Academy, felt to be vital given the extremes of Nepal's weather for indoor practice, which will be partly funded by the ACC. Nepal plays most of its international matches at the Tribhuwan University International Cricket Ground in the outskirts of Kathmandu. Other grounds include Engineering College Ground in Pulchowk. A host of other grounds are used for domestic tournaments including Tudikhel, Army School Ground and Lab School Ground. Various cricket academies have surfaced since 2010, like Sangrila Cricket Academy, Dhangadi Cricket Academy, and Jhapa Cricket Academy. The National Cricket Academy started functioning in late 2011. CAN has partly funded two upcoming national cricket academies in Mulpani and Pokhara.\nFormer coach Pubudu Dassanayake added the batting strength which had long been the Achilles' heel for Nepalese cricket. Under Dassanayake, Nepal has won World Cricket League divisions 4 and 3 (twice). Nepal participated in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh in March 2014, where they produced some good \nperformances, narrowly missing out on the next round on net run rate. As a result, they were awarded T20 International status by the ICC along with the Netherlands.\nOrganization.\nPresidents.\nBetween 2016 and 2019, Bhawana Ghimire was CEO of the Cricket Association of Nepal. CAN was suspended during this period for government interventions.\nAffiliated Province Cricket Associations.\nThere are currently 7 provincial cricket associations and 45 district cricket associations affiliated with CAN.\nControversies.\nDespite unprecedented success on the field, including victories over Hong Kong and Afghanistan at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, Nepal went through some turmoil off the field in 2014 with a boycott of the national one-day tournament by the national players with the captain Paras Khadka slamming the Cricket Association of Nepal for their treatment of national players.\nThe board then came under an investigation by the Commission for Investigation into Abuse of Authority. Later, CIAA filed a case against 18 CAN members including the then President Tanka Aangabuhang, after finding them guilty of misusing around Rs. 14.31 million, which was to be used for developing the game in the country instead. This resulted in several CAN members stepping down from their posts on moral grounds.\nIn May, members of CAN filed a no-confidence motion against president Tanka Angbuhang, after the organization of the Nepal Premier League was outsourced to a private sports management firm.\nIn March, the CAN had said Nepal coach Pubudu Dassanayake would get a year's extension to his contract. However, he was only given a three-month extension, which ran out later June. The change in terms, CAN secretary Ashok Nath Pyakuryal said, was due to the board being under investigation. The coach left the country on 4 June due to unresolved contractual issues.\nBut the Government of Nepal intervened and handed Dassanayake a year's extension. Dassanayake returned to Nepal on 29 August after being invited by the government and was reappointed coach of Nepal's senior and Under-19 cricket teams.\nAfter all these controversies in the year 2014, the Nepal Government dissolved the Angbuhang led CAN committee on 6 November and formed an ad hoc committee under former president Binaya Raj Pandey on an interim basis.\nAs a result of the governmental involvement in its running, the ICC suspended CAN in April 2016, though allowed the national teams to continue playing in international competitions."

In 1957, both expatriate and indigenous bodies merged to form the Nigeria Cricket Association (NCA). This name was changed to the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) in 2006.\nIn the 1960s, the NCF was involved in a movement, which resulted in the formation of a sub-regional cricket body, the West Africa Cricket Federation (WACF), with headquarters in Nigeria. Later, in 1976, the WACF evolved into the West Africa Cricket Conference (WACC). Nigeria was granted Associate Membership of the ICC in 2002."

        "text": "The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB; , ; formerly Afghanistan Cricket Federation) is the official governing body of cricket in Afghanistan. It is Afghanistan's representative at the International Cricket Council (ICC) and was an associate member of ICC from June 2013 until becoming a full member in June 2017. Before that it was an affiliate member and has been a member of that body since 2001. It is also a member of the Asian Cricket Council.\nIn August 2021, Taliban leaders arrived to the ACB headquarters accompanied by former Afghan national cricketer Abdullah Mazari, and ordered the cricket board to carry on the activities as usual.\nHistory.\nCricket in Afghanistan was first played during the 19th century Anglo-Afghan Wars, with British troops reported as having played in Kabul in 1839. However, unlike many countries, no lasting cricket legacy was left by the British, and it would be more than a hundred years before cricket returned.\nIn the 1990s, cricket became popular amongst Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was formed there in 1995. They continued to play cricket on their return to their home country in late 2001. Like all sports, cricket was originally banned by the ruling Taliban, but it became a notable exception in 2000 and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was elected as an affiliate member of the ICC the following year.\nThe Afghanistan national cricket team's 21-run win over Namibia in Krugersdorp earned them official One Day International status in April 2009. The team qualified for the 2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.\nOn 11 November 2010, the Afghan national women's cricket team was formed. This was to help females understand the game of cricket and have a parallel team to that of the men. Also policy states that as per Islamic tradition women can optionally wear a headscarf or hijab which is their own choice.\nIn July 2016, ACB unveiled a strategic plan and set targets for Afghanistan to be a top-six ODI team by 2019 and a top-three team in both T20Is and ODIs by 2025. In order to achieve this, ACB created a proposal to be presented to BCCI, in the works to secure annual bilateral matches against India and teams touring India beginning next year. Shafiq Stanikzai, Chief Executive of ACB, said the draft had been presented to BCCI president Anurag Thakur in May and further discussions had happened during the ICC Annual Conference in Edinburgh in June 2016.\nOn 22 June 2017, Afghanistan was granted Test nation status by the ICC. This was the first time in history that two teams earned test status at the same time. Afghanistan share this honour with Ireland, thus bringing the number of total number of test playing nations to twelve. On 14 June 2018, they played their first test match against India, which they lost within two days.\nDomestic competitions.\nFirst class\nList A\nT20\nAfghanistan's domestic structure consisted of a 25-over Inter-Provincial Tournament, which had the participation of 22 provinces in the tournament. The aim of the tournament was to spread the game across the country and to generate a greater depth of talent for the national team to select from. The best players from the tournament were selected for Afghanistan-A and under-19 teams based on their performance and would be sent for training and coaching to Bangladesh. Afghanistan teams often visit Pakistan. Currently Afghanistan A team is visiting Pakistan.\nTwo teams from the 12-team first round will advance to the next round. The top six from the tournament will then contest Afghanistan's main domestic event - a 50 over tournament in Kabul in May 2010. The 50 over tournament was won by Kabul Province.\nStarting in 2011, Afghanistan's domestic cricket structure has grown. The expanded Inter-Provincial Tournament was reorganized into a 50 over tournament and divided into a Challenge Cup section (the Etisalat ODN Challenge Cup with 20 provincial teams) and an Elite Cup section (with 12 provincial teams; 4 of them qualifiers from the Challenge Cup section). In addition to the Inter-Provincial cricket the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has divided the provinces of Afghanistan in to 5 Cricket Regions to enable the better management of the game. The Regions are Amo in the north (centered on Balkh), Spin Ghar in the east (centered on Nangarhar), Band-e-Amir in the centre (centered on Kabul), Mis Ainak in the southeast (centered on Khost), and Boost in the west and southwest (centered on Kandahar). The 5 regions in turn have representative teams which play in all traditional 3 formats of cricket; the Ahmad Shah Abdali One-Day Tournament, Ahmad Shah Abdali T20 Tournament and Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament.\nIn addition to an expansion of the inter-provincial tournament from 25-over matches to 50-over matches and the addition of the T-20 and multi-day formats, cricket in Afghanistan has now expanded across the provinces as well; 32 of the 34 provinces now have representatives sides All provinces except Daykundi and Farah have a representative team, while the ACB recognizes Afghan Refugees and Kochain as provincial teams. There are also plans to expand the three-day league competition into a four-day league in 2014.\nThe UAE-based telecommunications company, Etisalat is now one of the main sponsors of Afghanistan's cricket, including being the then title sponsor in Afghanistan's division 2 inter-provincinal challenge cup and the Etisalat Sixes T20 Tournament, which is now sponsored by Afghan company called \"Alokozay\" Shpageeza Cricket League.\nCricket grounds in Afghanistan.\nThe Afghan national cricket team does not play its home matches inside Afghanistan due to the ongoing security situation and the lack of international standard facilities. Afghanistan played their 'home' Intercontinental Cup fixture against Ireland at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Sri Lanka. Following Afghanistan's World Twenty20 qualifying campaign they played two One-Day Internationals against Canada at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the UAE, after which the stadium was named the 'home' ground of Afghanistan.\nThe President of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Omar Zakhilwal, announced in October 2010 that the government was planning to construct standard cricket grounds in all 34 provinces in the next two years.\nOther Home grounds for the Afghan National Team.\nIn January 2021, the Afghanistan Cricket Board made announcement of exploring the possibility of using Oman as a new 'home' venue for international cricket matches.\nNational team.\nThe Afghanistan national cricket team represents the country of Afghanistan in international cricket matches. The national team was formed in 2001, which played in the 2009 World Cup Qualifier after rising rapidly through the World Cricket League, starting in Division Five in May 2008. They play in the Elite division of the ACC Trophy.\nAfghanistan's 21-run win over Namibia in Krugersdorp earned them official One Day International status. Afghanistan won their first One Day International against Scotland. In 2011, the team qualified for the 2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.\nAfghanistan played its first 50 over World Cup in 2015. It played 6 matches in all and won 1 match (against Scotland) and losing the rest. Afghanistan has played in 3 T20 World Cups, 2010, 2012 and 2014. They also qualified for ICC World T20-2016.\nIn December 2015, Afghanistan hired the services of Manoj Prabhakar, the former Indian all rounder as their bowling coach.\nThe Afghanistan Cricket Board also maintained a women's national cricket team which was first organized in 2010. The team became inactive following the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021."

By the early 1860s, a number of cricket clubs were in operation, including the British CC, Artisan Amateurs CC, Rio British CC, Anglo-Brazilian CC and the British and American Club.\nIn 1872, George Cox formed the Rio Cricket Club, which soon began using the field as its home. In the early 1880s, George's son Oscar organized Brazil's first football games on this same ground. In 1889, Brazil became a Republic and Princess Isabel was forced to move from her residence. The cricket ground was taken over by the new government, and although the sport was allowed to continue for a time, a permanent facility was now required.\nIn 1922, the Brazil Cricket Association (BCA) was formed, with R.A. Brooking as its first President. \nAs cricket in Rio de Janeiro faded from the scene, it was left to São Paulo to carry the torch at SPAC until 1989, when the Brasília Cricket Association (ABRAC) was formed which fields men's and women's teams. In 1999 in Curitiba, Paraná, HSBC Bank built a cricket ground at its staff sports facility, which is home to Curitiba cricket. Then in 2011, the Carioca Cricket Club was founded and breathed new life into cricket in Rio. Most recently, the Minas Gerais Cricket Club in Belo Horizonte, and Poços de Caldas Cricket, also in Minas, both formed in 2013."

The first official record of cricket is in 1910 with the registration of the Rarotonga Cricket Association, however photos pre date this to at least the late 19th century. It is thought that cricket was originally brought to the capital Island of Rarotonga by merchant sailors and missionaries. Primarily played by the expat community local cricketers were playing well before the 1940s. Pukapuka, the furthest most northern island of the Cook Islands, which is closer to Samoa than any of its neighbouring Cook Islands, have long played a version of cricket named 'Polo Wale' more akin to the Samoan 'Kirikiti', though formal 'English' Cricket as it is called was introduced within the past 10 years. The Pukapukan's refer to cricket as their 'national sport' and it is no coincidence that the majority of the national male representative side originate from or are of Pukapukan descent.

Cricket Peru is Peru's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member and has been a member of that body since 2007. It is included in the ICC Americas region.\nCricket has been played in Peru for over 150 years, at the splendid Lima Cricket &amp; Football Club (LCFC), and is now undergoing resurgence as a recently admitted Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and a founder member of Cricket South America (CSA), along with Argentina, Brazil and Chile.\nDomestic Cricket.\nPeru traditionally held an 8- to 10-week season at the LCFC from February until Easter. Most of the fixtures were friendlies, and the most important regular matches on the calendar were traditionally the British Ambassador’s XI vs President of the LCFC XI and Asia vs Rest of the World. The latter is still hotly contested, while the former has been developed into a one-day cricket carnival, The Ambassador's Cup, featuring teams - and ambassadors - representing Australia, India, South Africa and UK.\nThe Easter holiday, which was traditionally a time for overseas touring teams to visit Lima, is now set aside for the South American Championship (SAC), a non-official, annual tournament between teams representing CSA members i.e. Argentina, Brazil, Chile &amp; Peru, as well as invited national teams. 2014 saw the 11th staging of this tournament, with Lima hosting.\nThe advantage of playing cricket in Lima is that play is never lost to rain!\nIn November 2006, a uniquely Peruvian cricket form, Cricket Veloz, was introduced to the cricketing calendar, and the Cricket Veloz Trophy has been hotly contested every year since. Originally designed as a four-team, indoor tournament, in 2009 it was rebranded as an outdoor 6-a-side festival, with great success, fitting nicely into the 150th Anniversary celebrations of the LCFC.\nNational Twenty20 Championship.\nIn 2007, the Peruvian National T20 Championship was inaugurated, with all games being played at LCFC.\nThe four founding teams were:\n1) The Kiteflyers: the cricketing arm of a multinational local football team - with a British core - founded in 1981.\n2) Eidgenossen: a team made up mainly of teachers from local British schools\nEidgenossenschaft is a German word meaning confederation. The term literally translates as \"oath fellowship\". An Eidgenossenschaft is a confederacy of equal partners, which can be individuals or groups such as states, formed by a pact sealed by a solemn oath. Such an alliance could be either time-limited or unlimited (or \"eternal\"). An important characteristic is that the partners were always considered equal, in contrast to the oath of fealty in feudal societies with their strict hierarchies. As a political term, it is used most often as a synonym for Switzerland, whose official German name is \"Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft\", usually translated as Swiss Confederation. An Eidgenosse is a member of an Eidgenossenschaft, and is an expression for \"Swiss citizen\".\n3) Chak De: a team made up of Peruvian residents from the Indian subcontinent. \n‘Chak De’ means ‘let’s go’ in Punjabi.\n4) LCFC: members and invited players from the Lima Cricket and Football Club\nOriginally, the T20 Championship was played over three Sundays, with each team playing the others once. But with the success of the format, and the addition of a fifth team, Lima Indians in 2013, the competition has now been expanded into two stages - the Apertura and the Clausura - lasting for 10 weeks of the season. Accordingly, the start of the season has been moved forward to early January.\nTacna, in the south of Peru, in the late 1990s and early 2000s had a sizable Pakistani population, many of whom were involved in the importation of second-hand cars; and from this community they were able to create a team, the Tacna Tigers, which annually visited Lima to play cricket, and provided a number of players for the national side. However, changes to the free trade zone regulations governing business in Tacna, from 2011 onwards, saw the Pakistani cricket community dwindle in size.\nInternational Cricket.\nCricket Peru's men's team are known as the 'Llamas', and have competed in international competitions since 1997, usually against other Latin American national sides.\nICC Americas Division III.\nThe Llamas competed three times in the ICC Americas Division III, an officially sanctioned ranking tournament, overseen by the International Cricket Council that offered a pathway to World League Cricket and potentially to playing in the World Cup.\n1. Buenos Aires, Argentina: 12 – 16 Feb, 2008:\nThis was a 50-over tournament, played at different venues in Buenos Aires, featuring 5 teams - Belize, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands - that had a stunning climax with three teams in a position to win the tournament before the final ball of the tournament. The eventual winners were the Turks and Caicos Islands, who were promoted to Division II.\nSecond place went to Chile on account of their lower net run rate. Belize finished third.\nPeru, captained by Harry Hildebrand, lost their first three games, but on the last day of the tournament, pulled off an upset by defeating Brazil, thereby securing fourth place, with Brazil in 5th.\n2. Santiago, Chile: 9 - 12 Oct, 2009:\nAgain this was a 50-over tournament, played at Craighouse in Santiago, Chile, with only 4 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile &amp; Peru. The Llamas, under the captaincy of Miles Buesst, lost all their games to finish fourth, but came close to defeating eventual champions, Brazil, in their final match, falling 17 short chasing 253.\n3. San Jose, Costa Rica: 14–18 March 2011\nThe format of this tournament was changed to T20, and featured 6 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile, hosts Costa Rica, Falkland Islands and Peru, playing at Los Reyes Polo Club on the outskirts of San Jose. The shorter format suited the Llamas' style of play, and Peru, captained by Miles Buesst (and Mike Soulsby, for one match) enjoyed their most successful international tournament to date, with a record of four wins out of five, and a highly creditable 2nd-place finish. The only loss was to the eventual undefeated champions, Belize, on the first morning.\nSuccess was based on a disciplined bowling unit of Miles Buesst, Nadeem Ahmed, Javed Iqbal, Tony Sanford and Dinesh Ekanayake, taking advantage of the low bounce of the wickets, and a large, slow outfield, backed up by good fielding, to starve batsmen of runs and force them into errors. Runs were at a premium on the two pitches used, and so batsmen had to be patient and correct to weather the initial storm of the opposition’s top bowlers, before making hay against the lesser bowlers. This approach was typified by Mike Soulsby’s masterly half century, off 63 balls, against Chile, that won him the Man of the Match award.\nSeemingly low T20 scores of under a hundred against Chile and Costa Rica were easily defended, and even the free-scoring Belizean batsmen took 14 overs to score 65, losing 6 wickets along the way, and indicating that the ball would dominate the bat for most of the Championship.\nThis was certainly the case against Mexico, who batting first, were rolled over for 49; and then the Falkland Islands were dismissed for 22, the lowest score of the tournament, as some of Peru’s second-string bowlers came to the fore.\nSouth American Championship.\nSadly, in 2012, ICC policy changed, with the focus shifting away from High Performance Cricket to increasing Participation Numbers. This decision was driven by an economic imperative.\nThe ramifications for Cricket Peru were that there would no longer be any ICC-sponsored international cricket. Solace could be found in the fact that the Llamas had been participating in the bi-annual South American Championships (SAC) since 1995.\nIn the wake of the ICC decision to scrap the ICC Americas Div III tournament, it was decided to make the SAC an annual T20 Easter championship, with the hosting rotating between the four members of Cricket South America.\nIn April 2014, it was the turn of Cricket Peru to host SAC XI. For the first time, Mexico were invited to join the tournament, which they did with great enthusiasm - so much so that they actually won the tournament, defeating Chile in the final, thereby taking the trophy out of South America for the first time!\nChile had won three games out of four leading up to the Final, but Brazil, Mexico and Peru had all won two games each; and so qualification to face Chile came down to wickets lost.\nCentral American Championship.\nAfter the success of the expanded 2014 South American Championships in Lima, Cricket Panama were inspired to invite additional teams to their March 2015 Central American Championship (CAC) in Panama City. The invitees that accepted were Peru, Brazil and M.C.C, who took their place alongside regulars Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador and, of course, Panama.\nAnother of the CAC regulars, Belize, pulled out at the eleventh hour, and their place was taken by a Panama A side, to keep the number of teams at eight, divided into two groups of four, playing T20 games.\nThe Llamas first match, on March 17, was against the M.C.C, who had just been on the wrong end of a hard-fought series in Suriname, and were in no mood to be generous. Featuring a number of County players and ex-players, they racked up an imposing 200 for 8 off their 20 overs. Peru, batting second, were never in the hunt and faltered to 79, for a chastening loss.\nThe next game was against old sparring partners, Brazil, on March 18. Again Peru bowled first and did well to keep the Brazil score down to 141 for 8. The reply started well, with Hallett, Soulsby and Myers all making quick runs, but after a mid-innings stutter, the run rate started to climb alarmingly. Some good late innings clubbing, and hard running, from man-of-the-match Buesst (35*) and Chaplin (5*), saw Peru home with 3 balls to spare, for a famous 5-wicket victory.\nThe last group game was against Panama A on the morning of March 19. Batting first, Peru racked up 147 for 9 off their 20 overs, with Soulsby (39), Buesst (35) and Myers (29) the main contributors. In a mirror image of the game the day before, the Panama A reply got off to a fast start and then faltered in the middle overs, as they lost wickets and the run rate increased. However, they got over the line with 3 balls to spare, and 5 wickets in hand, thanks to some good death batting.\nThe upshot of these group games was that Peru came third in the group, thereby missing out on progressing to the semi-final stage. They were able to take solace in a victory, that afternoon, over Costa Rica, who had come also third in their group, to claim 5th place. Drained from the morning's narrow loss, Peru's batsman struggled to a total of 109 for 8 from their 20 overs, with Soulsby and Myers again in the runs. However, the bowlers, led by Spry (3 for 12) and Roughton (3 for 14) and backed up by some good fielding, did enough to keep the Costa Rica batting line-up down to a total of 91 all out.\nThis was a satisfying end to an excellent tournament, with two wins and two losses.\nAmistad Cup.\nThe development of cricket in Peru and Brazil has followed quite similar trajectories since their acceptance as Affiliate Members of the ICC in the early 2000s, with a small group of keen volunteers facing sizable geographical and cultural challenges. This has led to a close friendship off the pitch - with the sharing of ideas and resources - and a healthy rivalry on the pitch.\nTo encapsulate this relationship, in 2011 it was decided to inaugurate the Amistad Cup (actually a Thermos flask), which would be awarded to the winner of any men's cricket game between Peru and Brazil. The loser would be given the dubious prize of The Spork (half spoon, half fork), which was found as a hidden extra in the lid of the Thermos!\nBrazil is the current holder of the Amistad Cup, having defeated Peru in the group stage of the 2015 South American Championship in Chile."

Prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the PCA organized a stable cricket league composed of mostly expatriate members.\nIn 2000, there were only two regular clubs in the PCA-organized league. Cricketers in the league at that time were mostly expatriates coming from Australia, Britain, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Zimbabwe while some were foreigners with Filipino heritage.\nThe PCA attained affiliate membership in 2003. In the same year there were only 45 recorded senior players.\nThe Philippine men's national cricket team under the PCA first competed internationally in 2011.\nIn 2014, the PCA organized the first official cricket match where one side is mostly composed of local Filipinos.

The Sierra Leone Grammar School and the Methodist Boys High School were the first schools in Freetown to embrace the sport. In the provinces, Bo government secondary school, founded in 1906, became the first school to play cricket. Sierra Leone played its first international matches against Gambia in 1935. West African inter-colonial tournaments were also held from the 1930s onwards, with Nigeria and Ghana eventually joining the teams. This led to the transformation of the inter-colonial tournament into a four-sided West African tournament, which began in 1967 and was periodically held with breaks. In 2006, the tournament was replaced by the North Western Conference (NWACC). \nIn 2009, the Sierra Leone Under-19 cricket team qualified for the ICC U-19 World Cup 2010 qualifying tournament. They achieved this after finishing second in the Africa Under-19 Championship held in Zambia. During the championship, they defeated more established associate teams from other African cricket-playing nations. Unfortunately, they were unable to participate in the tournament hosted by Canada due to visa issues, which prevented them from reaching the host nation. "

A draft constitution was agreed and subsequently ratified at the first annual General Meeting of the association. Today, the association has an associate membership of twenty one clubs &amp; six affiliated clubs and associations.\nThe first S.C.A. President was David Barmes of Geneva C.C. and Roger Johnson (of the same club) the first Secretary. Brennan, the then Australian Ambassador, presented a trophy to be played for in a knock-out competition between six clubs divided geographically into two sections. The winners of each group then played in a deciding final, for which, in 1983, the Malaysian Ambassador donated a cup for the Man of the Match. The main S.C.A. competition has been reorganized several times since and the current league format involves fifteen clubs divided into East &amp; West divisions.\nIn recent years, the Mr. Pickwick T20 Cup, a Twenty20 Competition, has been added to the fixture schedule.\nIn 1985, at the initiative of the Lyceum Alpinum, Zuoz, the SCA helped to organise the first Zuoz Cricket Festival. The Lyceum has a long tradition of cricket and other \"British\" sports (e.g. Eton Fives) dating from the 1920s when an English sports master was appointed. Four cricket matches can be played simultaneously on the grounds at Zuoz in an idyllic setting at an altitude of . Following a modest start (only four clubs participated in 1985), the festival is now well established with the regular participation of eight clubs.\nA Swiss national side played in the inaugural Cricketer International Tournament in Guernsey in 1990, narrowly missing the semi-final by 0.1 runs/over. Tours have been made over the years to various countries by individual clubs and by the Association, and there have been welcome visits by touring teams to Switzerland.\nIn 1985 the association was granted affiliate status of the ICC. In 2012, Switzerland lost its ICC affiliate status due to the creation of a second organisation (Schweizerischer Cricket Verband).\nOn 1 March 2014 the association was rebranded as Cricket Switzerland. The current President of the Cricket Switzerland is Alexander Mackay. Elected in 2011, he became the Association's sixth President, succeeding John McKillop, attaining membership of Swiss Olympic at the Sports Parliament in November, 2017.\nIn October 2020, Cricket Switzerland re-applied for ICC membership.\nClubs playing in the Cricket Switzerland Premier League.\nNine teams from across the country compete in the Cricket Switzerland Premier League, a 40 over cricket league format featuring the top 9 teams in the country.

        "title": "Bill Steele (baseball)",
        "text": "William Mitchell Steele (October 5, 1885 – October 19, 1949) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He pitched from 1910 to 1914 with the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Robins. Nicknamed \"Big Bill\", at , he was one of the larger players of his era. His main pitch was a spitball.\nSteele grew up in Milford, Pennsylvania. He began pitching at the professional level in 1909, and after winning 25 games for the Altoona Rams in 1910, he was signed by the Cardinals. Steele appeared in nine games with the team that year, then pitched a career-high innings in 1911. He led the National League (NL) with 19 losses while posting a 3.73 earned run average (ERA). In 1912, Steele posted the worst ERA (4.69) among pitchers with enough innings to qualify for the MLB ERA title. He claimed in 1913 that he had purposefully not been trying as hard as he could have in 1912, and this impaired his relationship with the front office. Bothered by rheumatism the next couple of seasons, Steele found himself used mainly as a mopup reliever by 1914. Sold to the Robins later that year, he finished his MLB career with eight appearances in a Brooklyn uniform. Steele then played minor league baseball for a couple more seasons. A few years after he retired, he and his family moved to the St. Louis area, where he worked as a mechanic for Swift and Company and later as a maintenance man at an A&amp;P warehouse. He was killed on October 19, 1949, when a streetcar ran into him.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Mitchell Steele was born on October 5, 1885, in Milford, Pennsylvania. His parents, Maurice and Caroline (\"Carrie\"), were the children of Germans who had immigrated to New York. Maurice worked at an ice business, a sawmill, and a watch-case factory, also serving at times as a constable. On top of this, the Steeles owned a farm. Growing up, Bill helped tend the farm along with three of his siblings (a fourth died at birth).\nSteele started playing baseball in rural pastures around Milford. He played the positions of pitcher and outfielder for Milford's local team, which held games against local and semipro teams, including competition as notable as the New York Cuban Giants. A 1907 article in the \"Pike County Dispatch\" reported that Steele's pitches were \"more of a puzzle than ever with his shoots, drops and the ‘spit ball’ which he has thoroughly mastered.\"\nBaseball career.\nAltoona (1909-10).\nBy 1909, Steele was pitching professionally for the Altoona Mountaineers of the Class B Tri-State League, though his career nearly came to a premature end. Early in the year, Steele was riding a streetcar and grabbed a sand lever on the vehicle. Not properly insulated, the lever \"\"shocked [Steele] almost to insensibility,\" and he \"narrowly escaped being electrocuted\" according to a local newspaper.\nSteele won his first eight starts for Altoona and completed 37 of 39 games he started for the Mountaineers. In July, he started both games of a doubleheader against the Trenton Tigers, throwing shutouts in both and driving in the winning run in the 10th inning of the second game. He finished the year tied for the league lead in losses (21), but his 19 wins were tied for fourth in the league. Steele pitched innings.\nAltoona became the Rams in 1910, and Steele became the best pitcher in their league. Major League Baseball (MLB) teams began scouting him, and in August, Steele's contract was purchased for $3,000 by the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League (NL). Roger Bresnahan, the team's manager, and Stanley Robison, the team's owner, had both been impressed when they came to watch him pitch. Steele completed 29 of 30 starts for Altoona, led the league with 25 wins, and helped the Rams become league champions. The \"big ranky side-armer … looks like a finished product,\" opined Jim Nasium, a Philadelphia reporter.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (1910-14).\n1910.\nAfter the minor league season, Steele joined the Cardinals in September. St. Louis was in the midst of a losing season; the ballclub would finish with a 63–90 record. In his September 10 debut, facing the Cincinnati Reds at the Palace of the Fans, Steele allowed five runs in the first inning but settled down after that, allowing seven runs in a complete game and contributing three hits, one of which was a triple, in St. Louis's 14–7 victory. He completed all eight of his starts that year and won four of his first five games, giving Cardinal fans something to cheer about in the midst of a seventh-place season. In nine games (eight starts) his rookie year, Steele had a 4–4 record, a 3.27 ERA, 25 strikeouts, 24 walks, and 71 hits allowed in innings pitched.\n1911.\nDeciding that the Cardinals needed a change of personnel, Bresnahan got rid of five of the Cardinal pitchers from the 1910 season; Steele was one of the only ones who remained on the roster through 1911. The \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" said \"[I]f Bresnahan’s team is to climb this year, it will be because the pitching is improved over the 1910 brand...\" citing Steele as an important factor in the club's 1911 fortunes. Steele struggled in his first two starts of the season, then had a ball hit off of his pitching arm during batting practice and missed two weeks of the season. He had just a 3–9 record through June 7, and St. Louis reporters noted that a lack of Cardinal scoring, occasional poor innings, and late-game struggles led to his lack of wins.\nJune 11 marked a turning point in Steele's season. After giving up four runs in the first inning to the Boston Rustlers, Steele pitched scoreless ball for the rest of the game. The Cardinals won 5–4, a victory that moved them into fourth place in the league after a rough start to the season. The victory was the first in a span of 10 decisions lasting through July 19, where Steele would lose only once. Teammate Miller Huggins thought he did \"excellent work\" on the mound during this time. He gave up six runs but got the win in a complete game, 8–6 victory over the Rustlers on July 13 that left the Cardinals just two games out of first place in the NL. After July 19, his pitching became less consistent, and he won only two of his final nine decisions. His victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on August 17 is notable for being the only shutout of his career; Steele gave up just five hits in the game. Steele finished the season having appeared in 43 games, 34 of which were starts, 23 of which he completed. He posted a 3.73 ERA in a career-high innings and had an 18–19 record, tying Earl Moore of the Phillies for the NL lead in losses. With a 75–74 record, the Cardinals finished in fifth place in the NL.\n1912.\nAn arm injury suffered during 1912 spring training contributed to early-season struggles by Steele. With a 3–7 record and an ERA of almost 6.00 in late June, Steele was moved to the bullpen after a June 18 start. He also served poorly in this role and was given the chance to start again on June 29. Facing the Reds, he \"rose heroic, like some grand old monolith by the River Nile\" according to the \"St. Louis Star and Times\" as he held Cincinnati to seven hits and contributed a triple with the bases loaded in the 7–2 victory. This instigated the best set of games Steele ever pitched, as he won six of seven decisions and posted a 1.95 ERA through August 3. In the last of those, on August 3, Steele held the Phillies to five runs (three earned) in a complete-game, 7–5 victory, improving his record for the season to 9–8. However, he did not win another game all season, going 0–5 the rest of the way. In 40 games (25 starts), he had a 9–13 record, 67 strikeouts, 66 walks, and 245 hits allowed in 194 innings pitched, getting \"hit hard\" according to baseball historian Frank Russo. Steele's 4.69 ERA, as well as his 11.4 hits allowed per nine innings pitched, were the worst totals among pitchers who threw enough innings to qualify for the MLB ERA title.\n1913.\nIn late February 1913, Steele criticized Bresnahan, who had been fired as manager the previous August. Steele accused him of not treating the players fairly, going on to say that he deliberately tried not to pitch as well because of this. The \"St. Louis Globe-Democrat\" in response suggested that Bresnahan kept Steele with the team when the pitcher did not deserve it, adding \"Steele is not deserving of the least bit of sympathy from anyone.\" Unpopular with the Cardinals' front office as a result, Steele's troubles increased when he came down with rheumatism in his right hip during spring training. He left the team in the middle of March, and the Cardinals did not know where he was when the season began. They kept him officially on the roster, however, because they needed pitchers. Steele rejoined the team a week into the season and \"prolonged his big-league career,\" according to the \"Post-Dispatch\", by holding Pittsburgh to one run and three hits on April 23 in a 3–1 victory. Despite the win, Steele was bothered by his rheumatism, as he limped on the field and had difficulty running to first base. In May, he was removed from games before the end of the third inning in half of his six starts. After that, he was mainly used as a mopup reliever. His last game of 1913 came on July 9, after which he did not pitch again, due either to complications with the rheumatism or a dislocated hip. He left the team (with its permission) in July to return to Milford and get married. In 12 games (nine starts), he had a 4–4 record, a 5.00 ERA, 10 strikeouts, 18 walks, and 58 hits allowed in 54 innings. The \"Post-Dispatch\" labelled his season a \"complete failure.\" He was not the only Cardinal to struggle, as last-place St. Louis had the highest team ERA in the NL.\n1914.\nAt spring training in 1914, Steele said that he believed he could win at least 25 games, but he again served in a mopup role once the regular season began. He did not get along with Huggins, who had succeeded Bresnahan as manager. On August 7, Steele's contract was sold to the Brooklyn Robins. Steele had only appeared in 17 games (two starts) thus far, posting a 1–2 record, a 2.70 ERA, 16 strikeouts, seven walks, and 55 hits allowed in innings.\nBrooklyn Robins (1914).\nWith Brooklyn, Steele made eight appearances, only one of which was a start. He won one game for the Robins, giving up one run in innings in a 9–6 triumph over Cincinnati in the first game of a doubleheader. In his last game of the year, on October 1, he entered in the ninth inning with Brooklyn leading the Phillies 7–6 and gave up three runs, taking the loss as Philadelphia triumphed 9–7. Those were his only decisions with Brooklyn; he had a 5.51 ERA, struck out three batters, walked seven, and gave up 17 hits in innings. In 25 games (three starts) between both teams, he had a 2–3 record, a 3.36 ERA, 19 strikeouts, 14 walks, and 72 hits allowed in innings.\nLater career.\nThe Robins optioned Steele to the Newark Indians of the Class AA International League after the 1914 season, but he was released without having played a game for them. The Syracuse Stars of the Class B New York State League picked him up for 1915. He made six appearances for the franchise, posting a 1–3 record. The team released him after two weeks because he was not in as good physical shape as they had hoped he would be. Steele then played for the Gettysburg Ponies of the Class D Blue Ridge League in 1916, also playing some local and semipro baseball around Milford before retiring. In 129 major league games (79 starts), he had a 37–43 record, a 4.02 ERA, 236 strikeouts, 235 walks, and 733 hits allowed in innings.\nDescription and pitching style.\nWhen Steele made his debut on September 10, 1910, reporter Jack Ryder called him a \"large and ferocious gentleman, with baleful ire in his amps and a curveball in his capacious mitt.\" His eyes were blue, his hair was black, and he had a very squarish jaw. High cheekbones accented how long his face was. At , he was one of the bigger players at that time. His nickname was \"Big Bill\". He often weighed nearly , but this could change during the summer. According to the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", \"[T]he hot weather during the middle of the season sets him back a great deal and peels off too much flesh making him go stale and weakening him.\" He relied mainly on the spitball but also threw a fastball and curveball. According to the \"Altoona Tribune\" in 1910, Steele could \"make the spitter break any old way he pleases. Some times it goes over with a slide shoot; other times it drops a foot.\"\nPersonal life.\nSteele met Ann Farr Doyle, a St. Louis resident, in early 1912. They were married in 1913 and had one son, Bernard, who would be born six years later. Bernard played three years of minor league baseball in the 1940s, interrupted by a four-year service in the military during World War II. A first baseman, he batted over .300 in his career, though he never played above the Class B level. The Steeles lived in Milford until several years after Bill had retired; they then moved to 8275 Albin Street in Overland, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. Swift and Company employed him as a mechanic, and he later worked for A&amp;P as a maintenance man at one of their warehouses. As a side business, he raised New Zealand rabbits, which he sold to local hospitals so they could use them for experiments. Ann was the owner of a confectionery store until her death in 1945.\nDeath.\nOn October 19, 1949, a rainy evening, Steele was hit by a streetcar in Overland, just two blocks from his house. Taken to St. Louis County Hospital, he was declared dead when the ambulance arrived. Initially, the coroner declared that Steele's death was a homicide. Walter F. Hibler, the streetcar operator, refused to testify, and no other witnesses to the death were found. Thus, Hibler was never charged with any wrongdoing. Steele was buried in St. Louis's Memorial Park Cemetery, Section 1, Lot 373."

        "text": "The Toronto Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team is an ice hockey team operated by the Varsity Blues athletics program of the University of Toronto. They are members of the Ontario University Athletics conference and compete in U Sports. The Varsity Blues senior team won the Allan Cup in 1921 and 1927, and won the gold medal for Canada at the 1928 Winter Olympics. The team is based at Varsity Arena on the University downtown campus in Toronto, Ontario. \nThe Varsity Blues have won 39 conference titles in the OUA; and 10 U Sports championships in 1965–66, 1966–67, 1968–69, 1969–70, 1970–71, 1971–72, 1972–73, 1975–76, 1976–77 and 1983–84.\nHistory.\nThe Varsity Blues were founded in 1891, and are the longest continuously operated ice hockey program in the city of Toronto. The program currently includes only players enrolled at the University, however the Varsity Blues have historically had a junior ice hockey team for students, and a senior ice hockey team for graduates. \nNotable coaches of the Varsity Blues include Conn Smythe, Ace Bailey, Tom Watt, and Mike Keenan, and Lester Bowles Pearson later Nobel Peace Prize recipient and Prime Minister of Canada.\nDavid Bauer played for the Varsity Blues during the 1945–46 season, before becoming a Basilian priest and then founding the Canada men's national ice hockey team in 1963.\nSenior team.\nThe Varsity Blues graduates were a successful OHA Senior A League team in the 1920s and 1930s. They won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as league champions in 1921, 1927, 1929, and 1930. Toronto also became Canadian national champions with their victories at the 1921 Allan Cup and the 1927 Allan Cup.\nDuring the 1920 Allan Cup playoffs, Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) president Frederick E. Betts expressed concerns that the Varsity Blues team had violated the rules by participating in both the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union (CIAU) playoffs. At the 1920 general meeting, the CAHA debated the issue and decided that the team was eligible for the Allan Cup.\n1928 Winter Olympics.\nThe University of Toronto Graduates as the 1927 Allan Cup champions were chosen to represent the Canada men's national team in ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics. Conn Smythe coached the team during the OHA season, but refused to go to the Olympics due to disagreements on which players were added to the team by the Canadian Olympic Committee. The Graduates went without Smythe, led by team captain Red Porter, and Olympic Committee member W. A. Hewitt, who oversaw the team's finances. The format of the Olympics hockey tournament saw the Canadians receive a bye into the second round, without any games in the first week. Despite the wait to play, the Graduates won all three games by scoring 38 goals and conceding none, to win the gold medal.\n1928 Olympic roster:\nSome sources show the names of Norbert Mueller and John Porter as being on the Olympic roster, but those two names are not listed in the \"Official\" Olympic Winter Games guide.\nJunior team.\nThe Varsity Blues formerly operated a junior ice hockey team, that played in the OHA in the 1930s, but withdrew from the junior loop during the 1939–40 season.

        "text": "Clifton Garfield Curtis (July 3, 1881 – April 23, 1943) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball. His middle name, Garfield, is assumed to derive from that of U.S. president and fellow Ohio native James A. Garfield, who was fatally shot the day before Curtis was born.\nCurtis had an extensive minor league pitching career, winning 151 games in the minors between 1902 and 1918. His largest stint was with the Milwaukee Brewers. He pitched for them for six full seasons from 1904 to 1909, and in his first season won 24 games for the Brewers. His major league career lasted from 1909 to 1913, where he never had a winning season.\nWhile pitching for the last-place Boston Doves (later known as the Rustlers, and later still as the Braves) in 1910 and 1911, Curtis set a record of 23 consecutive losses. The record was eventually broken in 1993, when New York Mets pitcher Anthony Young lost 27 consecutive games in which he had a decision.\nDuring his lengthy losing streak, Curtis also failed to pick up a win in 28 consecutive starts, which also established a Major League record. This record was tied by Matt Keough (1978–79) and Jo-Jo Reyes (2008–2011), but to date it has not been broken.\nHe died from a heart attack aged 61."

San Marino are a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) and Rugby Europe.\nOverview.\n2013\nThe Republic of San Marino still doesn't have a National Team for rugby 15.\nThe only existing national rugby team of the Republic of San Marino is a rugby 7s team. This team was born on the occasion of his first competition on 25 and 26 May 2013, in the twenty-seventh edition of the annual international tournament \"Benidorm Seven\", in the homonymous city, in Spain.\nThis national team ended up last in the above-mentioned competition, suffering six defeats against the following six formations: Crusaders (United Kingdom), Barbarians (Belgium), Grenoble, La Vila, Comunidad Valenciana and a selection of Malaysia.\nIt should however be noted that these other formations are selections of professional players, while the National Team of San Marino is made up exclusively of players from the Rugby Club San Marino and absolutely amateur, as well as being at their first experience of rugby 7s outside the territory of the Republic of San Marino.\nConsidering the enormous gap in the players' levels, it should be considered a good result the six tries scored by the National Team in the whole tournament (an average of one try per game). The tries were scored by Bastianelli (2), Garavini, Giardi, Gobbi and Maiani Fa.\n2014\nThe second performance (which is also the first \"official\" one) of the national team took place in Thessaloniki (Greece) on 31 May 2014, in the B-category of the European tournament of rugby 7 FIRA-AER.\nPlayers: Navid Ataei, Mattia Bastianelli (cap.), Gianluca Conti, Niccolò Cozza, Luca Di Bisceglie, Juan Pablo Flores, Davide Giardi, Francesco Gobbi, Franco Maiani, Fabio Matteini, Carlo Terenzi, Fabio Tonelli\nAgain the team ended up last (10th place) in the competition, also due to the hard pool in which it was placed by drawing lots, that is against Hungary, Austria and Montenegro.\nDespite being highly inferior to the opponents, both on a technical and physical side, the sammarinese selection managed to avoid to cut a poor figure, showing good game and intimidating several times the enemies' defenses; this in particular against Hungary, that will end up first in the tournament earning the chance to fight for the A-category next year.\nThe results: \n2015\nOn 6 June 2015 drove to Zenica (Bosnia and Herzegovina) to take part in the Rugby Europe Men's Sevens Championships, Division C.\nPlayers: Navid Ataei, Davide Bacciocchi, Mattia Bastianelli (cap.), Niccolò Cozza, Luca Di Bisceglie, Michele Garavini, Davide Giardi, Francesco Gobbi, Facundo Maiani, Carlo Terenzi, Marino Terenzi, Fabio Ugolini\nHere you can see the results of the Championship: 2015 Rugby Europe Men's Sevens Championships\nSan Marino passed the qualification pool thanks to its outstanding victory on Liechtenstein (43-0), gaining access to the \"Plate\" round (5th to 8th places).\nEnded up 8th, losing the last three matches vs Serbia, Estonia and Malta.\nAn honorable result, 8th on 12, for the small Republic of San Marino, being also listed above some stronger and more experienced teams, like Montenegro (11th) and Belarus (10th)."

        "title": "Jason Williams (rugby league, born 1966)",
        "text": "Jason Paul Williams (born 23 April 1966) is a New Zealand former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s. A New Zealand international representative er, he played his club football in Australia for Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies, Eastern Suburbs Roosters, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Penrith Panthers as well as in England for Salford. Williams played 145 games in the Australian competition from 1987–88 and 1991–98, scoring a total of 63 tries and winning the 1995 ARL Premiership with the Canterbury club. Williams played in 12 test matches for New Zealand between 1991 and 1995, scoring one try. He played in one non-test international on the 1993 Kiwis tour against Wales and two World Cup matches (1991, 1995).\nBackground.\nWilliams was born in Christchurch, New Zealand.\nPlaying career.\nJason Williams was a Christchurch junior who moved to Australia at the age of 15. He was signed by the Western Suburbs Magpies for the 1987 NSWRL season, but after a poor season which saw only 2 tries in just 7 games, Williams was released by the Magpies and he was signed by the Eastern Suburbs Roosters for the 1988 season. His time with the Roosters was similar to his season at Wests, playing only 8 games and scoring just a single try.\nFollowing the season, Williams spent 1989 and 1990 playing in the Metropolitan Cup. He made the most of another chance when the South Sydney Rabbitohs offered him a contract for 1991, going on to play 16 games and scoring 12 tries for the season. His performances on the wing for Souths saw him make his test début for New Zealand against Australia at Olympic Park in Melbourne for the first test of the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series, the Kiwi's upsetting the Aussies 24-8. He played all three tests of the series, won 2-1 by Australia\nNow a Kiwi test player, Jason Williams was signed by Canterbury-Bankstown Chief Executive Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore. Williams had to wait until the 1993 New Zealand Kiwis Tour of Great Britain and France before he was re-called into the test lineup. During the three test series against Great Britain, Williams would score his only test try in the third and final test at the Headingley Stadium in Leeds (Great Britain won the match 29-10 and the series 3-0). He then played on the wing in the final test of the tour, a 36-11 victory over France. He went on to play in 73 games for the Bulldogs between 1992 and 1995, scoring 34 tries, including scoring a 70m intercept try in Canterbury's 12-36 loss to the Canberra Raiders in the Grand Final, and on the wing in Canterbury's 17-4 Grand Final win over Manly-Warringah at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nAfter the Grand Final loss to the Raiders, Williams spent a season in England playing for Salford, before returning to Canterbury for their 1995 premiership campaign.\nBefore the end of the 1995 season it was announced that Williams had signed with the Penrith Panthers for 1996 and he was promptly dropped to Reserve Grade by coach Chris Anderson after Round 17. Williams won a reprieve and was brought back into the team on the interchange bench for Canterbury's 25-6 win over Canberra in the Preliminary final before taking his place on the wing in the Grand Final victory over Manly following an injury to flying winger Brett Dallas.\nWilliams was selected as part of the New Zealand team for the 1995 Rugby League World Cup and played in just one game during the tournament. The game against Papua New Guinea at Knowsley Road in St. Helens, England, saw the Kiwis win 22-6 on their way to a Semi-final berth against the eventual champions, Australia.\nWilliams left Canterbury following the Grand Final to join Penrith for the 1996 season. He would spend three seasons at the foot of the Blue Mountains, all in three different competitions. 1996 was in the ARL's Optus Cup. 1997 was spent while the Panthers were part of the breakaway Super League competition while his last season before retirement was in the new National Rugby League in 1998.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2012, Williams coached the Western Suburbs Magpies in the NSW Cup. In 2013 he joined the Wests Tigers as an assistant coach for the club's NSW Cup team."

As of October 2014 they have played only a handful of matches, but have qualified for the 2014–16 European Nations Cup Third Division. The team's main stadium was Viimsi Staadion for several years.\nHistory.\nA combined Estonia/Latvia side took on a Swedish representative side in the late 1990s, but a proper national team only started playing in August 2009, touring England and playing two matches, losing both. They came up against Kent club Tonbridge Juddians in their first match, coming out at the wrong end of a 94–7 scoreline. The Juddians gave them a rather torrid time in the scrums, which was probably influenced by the fact that the Estonians only had their first-ever scrum machine session on the morning of the match. The second fixture saw them square off against England Deaf at Folkestone, this time managing to keep the score to a respectable 21–27.\nEstonia have since played several matches as they have built up their team. They were defeated by the Welsh national deaf team in Tallinn, losing 93–3 in June 2012, with closer defeats to Finland, Finland 'A' and Turkey.\nEstonia obtained their first win a play-off match for a position in the 2014–16 European Nations Cup Third Division, defeating Belarus 59–12."

        "text": "The 2004 PGA Championship was the 86th PGA Championship, played August 12–15 at the Straits Course of the Whistling Straits complex in Haven, Wisconsin (postal address Kohler). The purse was $6.25 million and the winner's share was $1.125 million.\nVijay Singh, the 1998 champion, earned his third and final major title in a three-hole aggregate playoff, defeating Justin Leonard and Chris DiMarco. At the time Singh, age 41, was third in the world rankings; the win moved him to #2 and he ascended to the top spot three weeks later, displacing Tiger Woods.\nIt was the first major championship at the expansive Straits Course, designed by Pete Dye and opened in 1998, which allowed high attendance and was highly profitable for the PGA of America. It set records with over 94,400 tickets sold and an overall attendance of 320,000 for the week. The overall economic impact was $76.9 million, shattering the previous record of $50.4 million in 2002, and nearly doubling that of 2003.\nThe PGA Championship returned just six years later, in 2010, displacing the more confined Sahalee Country Club near Seattle, which hosted in 1998, Singh's first major win. The admittance at Sahalee in 1998 was capped at 25,000 per day by the PGA of America. In early 2005, its chief executive officer, Jim Awtrey, cited the proximity to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver as the main reason for the retraction, and that Sahalee was targeted for 2012 to 2015 for another PGA Championship. Whistling Straits was awarded the 2010 event days later. The PGA of America has yet to commit to a return to Sahalee before 2028, but the championship returned to the West in 2020 at San Francisco.\nField.\n\"Full eligibility list\"\nHistory of the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits.\nThis was the first major championship held at Whistling Straits, and the Straits Course hosted the PGA Championship again in 2010, which also ended in a playoff, and 2015. It hosted the Ryder Cup in 2020. The course also hosted the U.S. Senior Open in 2007, won by Brad Bryant.\nThis was the second PGA Championship (and major) in the state of Wisconsin; 71 years earlier, the 1933 edition was played at Blue Mound in Wauwatosa, just west of Milwaukee. The PGA Tour stopped in the state regularly with the Greater Milwaukee Open (1968–2009), preceded by the Milwaukee Open Invitational (1955–1961).\nCourse layout.\nStraits Course\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 12, 2004\"\nLed by Darren Clarke, 39 players broke par in Thursday opening round. Clarke birdied the first four holes and finished at 7-under-par 65. It was the lowest score under par in the first round of a major since Chris DiMarco had a 7-under 65 at the 2001 Masters. He was one stroke better than Justin Leonard and Ernie Els.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 13, 2004\"\nJustin Leonard posted a 3-under 69 and Vijay Singh carded a 4-under 68 to share a one stroke lead at 9 under midway through the 86th PGA Championship. Opening round leader Darren Clarke shot a 1-under 71 and is tied for third with Ernie Els and Briny Baird. Tiger Woods made two straight birdies on 16 and 17 to avoid missing his first cut in 128 events. Miguel Ángel Jiménez, who shot the low round of the day of 65, ended in a tie for 13th at 3-under.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 14, 2004\"\nVijay Singh shot 69 to reach 12 under par as he tried to add a third major title to his 1998 PGA Championship and 2000 Masters. Justin Leonard carded 70 and was at 11 under. Leonard, who had a two-shot lead after making a 6-foot birdie on the 12th, bogeyed Nos. 15 and 18 to keep him one behind. Briny Baird, the leader at one point, pulled his tee shot over the cliff left of the par-3 17th and wound up with a triple bogey to knocked him out of contention. He wound up with a 75 and was seven shots behind.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 15, 2004\"\nAn exciting final round filled with missed opportunities led to a three-man playoff between Vijay Singh, Chris DiMarco and Justin Leonard. Ernie Els missed the playoff by one stroke, thanks to a bogey at No. 18, and completed a disheartening season of near-misses in the majors. He finished fourth, tied with Chris Riley who also bogeyed No. 18. Els finished second in the Masters, second in the British Open and ninth in the U.S. Open.\nPhil Mickelson also had a chance to get into the playoff, needing a birdie at the 72nd hole. Mickelson however took bogey and added a sixth-place finish to his memorable run at the majors in 2004. Mickelson won the Masters, took second in the U.S. Open and placed third in the British Open. K.J. Choi also had a chance to get into the playoff with a birdie, but also bogeyed the 72nd hole to finish two strokes behind. Tiger Woods bogeyed two of the first four holes and wound up with a 73, his worst finish in the majors this year, and extended his streak to 10 majors without winning, which was the longest drought of his career at that time. He won the next major, his fourth green jacket at the Masters, in 2005.\nLeonard, playing in the final group at the PGA Championship for the third time, took a two-shot lead with five holes to play with an birdie putt on 13. Leonard missed four putts inside down the stretch including a 12-foot par putt on No. 18 which would have given him his second major championship. DiMarco, the only player in the final nine groups to break par, had an 18-foot birdie putt to win on the 72nd hole that he left short. He also lost in a playoff in the next major, to Woods at Augusta, and ended his career without a major victory.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nAfter 72 holes, Singh, DiMarco and Leonard were tied on 8 under par, requiring a three-hole aggregate playoff, over the 10th, 17th, and 18th holes. Singh, who had yet to make a birdie during the day, got off to fast start with a birdie at the 10th hole, a short par-4 at . Singh nearly drove the green and left a simple pitch to , while DiMarco and Leonard both made par.\nSingh then laced a 3-iron to within 6 feet on the par-3 17th, but missed the putt and all three men made par. Leonard and DiMarco needed to gain a stroke on Singh on the par-4 18th and neither came close — DiMarco in a bunker, Leonard so far away that he used a wedge to chip on the green. Neither finished the hole, and Singh's par secured his second PGA Championship and third career major. His 76 on Sunday was the highest final-round score ever by a PGA champion.\nScorecard.\n\"Playoff\"\n\"Cumulative playoff scores, relative to par\""

The \"Connecticut Post\" describes Rutgers' first-ever win over UConn, a 74-70 win on February 10, 1998 at the Louis Brown Athletic Center, as the \"catalyst in what has become a fierce rivalry.\" After the unranked Scarlet Knights nearly upset the then-undefeated Huskies on January 8, 2003, the two teams were scheduled to play twice during the 2003–04 regular season, and have done so every season since. While the Huskies would handily win the next three meetings, Rutgers finally broke through on February 18, 2005, as they defeated the Huskies for the first time in seven years, 76–62.\nThe rivalry had been partially fueled by an altercation that occurred between UConn head coach Geno Auriemma and former Rutgers player Cappie Pondexter after the 2005 Big East Tournament championship game. Auriemma reportedly made inappropriate remarks towards Pondexter, who retaliated by pointing her finger towards Auriemma. Big East Commissioner Michael Tranghese released a statement days later clearing Auriemma of any wrongdoing.\nIn recent years, the teams have met for games that included championship implications. On March 7, 2007, the Scarlet Knights won their first-ever Big East Tournament championship by beating the Huskies 55–47. However, on March 3, 2008, UConn would defeat Rutgers for the regular-season championship 66–46 and the Knights haven't beaten the Huskies since.\nAfter Tennessee stopped scheduling Rutgers, the \"Connecticut Post\" said in 2008 that Connecticut had become Rutgers' biggest rival. Auriemma said about Rutgers, \"\"A lot of times, they talked like they were better than they were and that kind of caused a lot more of an intensity level than maybe there would have been with anyone else.\""

The American University Eagles won the league's regular season, and received the number one seed in the tournament. They kept their home advantage throughout the tournament and defeated Colgate, 52–46, on March 14, 2008, to win the conference tournament and received the Patriot League's automatic bid for the 2008 NCAA tournament.\nBefore the tournament.\nPrior to the season defending champion Holy Cross, was predicted to finish first in the league once again, while Bucknell, a team who had won a game in both the 2005 and 2006 NCAA Tournaments, was predicted to finish second. However the league was unpredictable, as both teams ended their conference regular seasons with a losing record. Lafayette started off strong in league play, but quickly fell by the wayside. American and Navy, teams predicted to finish fifth and seventh respectively, ended their seasons in first and second in the league, with American gaining home court advantage throughout the tournament.\nBracket.\nThe Patriot League announced the bracket and seed on March 3, 2008."

        "title": "List of American football teams in the United Kingdom",
        "text": " American football was introduced to the United Kingdom during the early part of the 20th century by American servicemen stationed in the country. The first recorded match took place on 23 November 1910 at Crystal Palace, London, where a team made up of the crew from USS \"Idaho\" defeated their counterparts from USS \"Vermont\" 19–0. During the Second World War, matches were played by American and Canadian servicemen stationed in the UK at venues throughout the country. This included the 'Tea Bowl' game played at the White City Stadium in 1944, and this was followed by the creation of the United States Armed Forces Europe (USAFE) league in 1946. This league consisted of teams from American military bases throughout Europe, with one of the league's three conferences made up of teams based in the UK – teams from this conference won the league championship thirteen times until the competition ceased in 1993.\nThe first teams open to British players were established in 1983, and competition began the following year in the form of a series of one-off games. The match results were compiled into a 'Merit Table', with teams playing more than three games eligible for the championship—the first champions were the London Ravens, who won all ten of their matches. Hundreds of clubs have since been formed, playing both full contact football and flag football at senior, university and youth level. Many of these clubs have since folded, renamed or merged with other local teams, but a few of the older clubs survive today.\nThe sport is administered by the British American Football Association (BAFA), with two main bodies of competition; the BAFA National Leagues (BAFANL) and the British Universities American Football League (operating as part of the British Universities and Colleges Sport competition).\nNational Football League.\nAs part of the NFL International Series, the National Football League, which otherwise has all of its teams resident in the United States, has one team with a permanent part-time residence in the UK.\nThe league also plays neutral-site games in London under the International Series banner. Since 2007, these have all been at Wembley Stadium; in 2019, the neutral-site games moved to the new home of Tottenham Hotspur.\nBAFA National Leagues.\nThe BAFA National Leagues (BAFANL) was formed in 2010 by the BAFA in response to the British American Football League's decision to split from the governing body.\nThe senior league's membership comprises 68 teams based in towns ranging from Newquay in the south of England to Aberdeen in Scotland. The league is split into two regional conferences; the Southern Football Conference (SFC) and the Northern Football Conference (NFC). The teams within each conference are spread across three tiers with promotion and relegation between each level. The bottom two tiers are further divided into regional conferences. The top-ranking teams in each division compete in playoffs culminating in divisional finals—the championship game contested by the top Premier Division teams is known as the BritBowl. The 2017 champions are the Tamworth Phoenix, who defeated the London Blitz 34–28 in the final held at the Sixways Stadium.\nIn addition to adult contact football, the BAFA runs youth, junior and women's contact football, and also flag football across all age ranges. A number of the teams within the league operate teams across two or more of these competitions. The British American Football Association defines the age ranges used within the league as follows:\nNorthern Ireland.\nNorthern Irish teams compete in an amateur island-wide regional competition in Ireland, organised by the Irish American Football League (IAFL). Teams from Northern Ireland compete in the Northern Division of the IAFL. The teams, along with other amateur teams in Northern Ireland and throughout the rest of Ireland, also compete in competitions such as the Shamrock Bowl.\nCurrently neither of the two universities of Northern Ireland compete in either the British Universities or the IAFL College Bowl.\nBritish Universities and Colleges Sport.\nThe British Universities American Football League (BUAFL) was formed in 2007 by the BAFA after the organisation that ran its predecessor ceased operations. Since 2012, the league has operated under the jurisdiction of British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS).\nThe league operates on three tiers – two Premier divisions (North and South) with 6 regional conferences in the lower two tiers – with most teams from the two Premier divisions competing in postseason Championship playoffs. A system of promotion and relegation is used between the three tiers. The two teams that progress through the playoffs compete in the National Championship Final (formerly the College Bowl) which is held at the South Leeds Stadium.\nThe 2016-17 champions are the Stirling Clansmen, who defeated the Durham Saints 10–7 in the final played at the Sixways Stadium, Worcester.\nExhibition Teams.\nThe following teams are Exhibition teams who play several annual games on the continent against a European League team. The team is made up of a selection of BAFANL players from other sides.\n8GL League.\nThe 8GL League is an 8 vs 8 Adult contact League, initially set up as a separate entity not under the governing body of the British American Football Association.\nAmerican High School League in Europe.\nThe American High School League in Europe (also referred to as High School Football Europe) is a competition organised by the European branch of the Department of Defense Dependents Schools. The teams in this league are drawn from high schools affiliated with US military bases within Europe, with the exception of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College which is a further education college located in Filton, England. The league in its present format was founded in 1975, with its constituent teams divided into three divisions. All teams play a regular season schedule against the other teams in their regional conference, with the top-ranked teams competing in playoffs to decide the divisional champions. As of 2017, only one team based in the United Kingdom competes in the league, compared to the five teams that competed in 2012.\nBristol Academy Community League.\nThe Bristol Academy Community League (BACL) is a competition set up by the Bristol Academy of Sport in December 2012 for school pupils in Bristol and its surrounding areas. The league provides competition for players in the 14-17 and 17-20-year age brackets. The league comprises six teams, representing a specific geographic area. "

He made his Major League debut for Boston in 1970, coming into the sixth inning in relief of Chuck Hartenstein to finish an 8–2 blowout loss to the Cleveland Indians. His only other Major League appearance came in relief in another blowout, pitching two-thirds of an inning in an eventual 13–2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.\nMills is the father of Ryan Mills, who pitched for seven seasons in the Minnesota Twins minor league system. The elder Mills began a website about pitching and pitching instruction. On that website, he noted that the injury-plagued Mark Prior had scapular loading in his pitching mechanics.\nHe died of melanoma on March 28, 2015."

        "text": "The 1936 AFL season is the first season of the second American Football League, the formation of which was announced by Harry March, former personnel director of the NFL's New York Giants, on December 15, 1935. Fifteen cities bid for charter franchises; on April 11, 1936, franchises were awarded to eight cities: Boston, Cleveland, Jersey City, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Providence, and Syracuse. By mid-summer, Jersey City, Philadelphia, and Providence withdrew; soon afterwards, Rochester was given a franchise, only to have it relocated to Brooklyn, despite the lack of availability of a home stadium at the time.\nThe league began its existence by raiding NFL rosters for its players, with a new New York Yankees team signing members of the New York Giants, the Cleveland Rams taking Chicago Bears star Damon Wetzel as their coach, and the Pittsburgh Americans snaring members of the crosstown Pirates. On the other hand, eventual AFL champions Boston Shamrocks pretty much ignored the roster of the crosstown Boston Redskins, while the Brooklyn Tigers and Syracuse Braves opted for \"home grown\" talent.\nThe race to the 1936 AFL championship quickly narrowed down to three teams (Boston, Cleveland, and New York) as the Syracuse team was moved to Rochester after a deafening lack of fan support while it lost almost every game. The former Syracuse Braves became the Rochester Braves in early October 1936 — and folded after their game on November 1. Two weeks later, the Brooklyn Tigers moved to Rochester and became the Rochester Tigers. The two Rochester teams finished in the bottom of the league standings.\nIn contrast to the following year, the majority of the AFL had winning records in 1936 (the two Rochester teams had one win combined). The Pittsburgh Americans finished with a 3-2-1 record despite averaging only 2500 fans in the Forbes Field stands; the Boston Shamrocks (8-3-0) won the title by defeating both the Cleveland Rams (5-2-2) and the New York Yankees (5-3-2) in the season's final weeks."

After the folding of the Syracuse/Rochester Braves in the 1936 season and the departure of the Cleveland Rams for the National Football League, the league added the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Bulldogs, the latter being the first professional football team to play its home games on the American West Coast.\nThe season got off to a rocky start, with the Pittsburgh Americans folding after playing only three games. After a 1936 move from Brooklyn, the Rochester Tigers limped through with a paucity of fan support. The defending champion Boston Shamrocks and 1936 contender New York Yankees were hit hard by the raiding of their rosters by the NFL, a counterpoint to the latter's method of building its squad; as a result, both wound up with losing records (Boston's 2–5–0 and New York's 2–3–1). Cincinnati's Bengals almost matched the Yankees in their futility, finishing with a 2–3–2 record.\nOnly two teams in the AFL finished with a .500 or better record in 1937: the Rochester Tigers and the team that was rejected when the NFL admitted the Rams, the Los Angeles Bulldogs The West Coast newcomers dominated the league, finishing 8–0–0, the first perfect season (no losses, no ties) by a professional football team while winning its league championship (the 1948 Cleveland Browns and the 1972 Miami Dolphins would later match the feat).\nThe Bulldogs had an average 14,000 attendance for its 1937 home games, comparable to the draws of the Rams, Shamrocks, and Yankees the previous year, but Cleveland's absence and decline of the other two 1936 contenders (both on the field and in the stands) proved devastating to the AFL. Of the six AFL teams, only Los Angeles made a profit. With the league owners having lost their optimism, the second American Football League came to an end. The Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Bulldogs continued their existence as independent teams while the other AFL franchises ceased to exist.\nAll-League selections.\nBill Moore, Los Angeles (end) &lt;br&gt;\nBill Steinkinber, Cincinnati (tackle) &lt;br&gt;\nPete Meloringer, Los Angeles (guard) &lt;br&gt;\nLee Mullenuaux, Cincinnati (center) &lt;br&gt;\nAlex Drobnitch, New York (guard) &lt;br&gt;\nHarry Field, Los Angeles (tackle) &lt;br&gt;\nRed Fleming, Boston (end)&lt;br&gt;\nHarry Newman, Los Angeles (quarterback)&lt;br&gt;\nDon Geyer, Cincinnati (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nAl Nidelazri, Los Angeles (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nGordon Gore, Los Angeles (fullback)"

Its large, modern, combined club and boat house is on the Surrey bank of the Thames, facing the Walton Mile straight, at Walton-on-Thames about 400 metres above Sunbury Lock cut. The club organises several rowing events, and members have competed at international level.\nHistory and events.\nThe initial establishment of a club and affiliation to the Amateur Rowing Association took place in 1927 with the contribution of members of Thames Rowing Club and Kingston Rowing Club and including active members of Thames Valley Skiff Club and the now defunct Oatlands Rowing Club. The club's first President was Steve Fairbairn. Activities ceased during World War II and in the postwar period much effort was spent on establishing a clubhouse and boat house. This was the forerunner to the present building at the end of Sunbury Lane, 1953 to 2011.\nThe Club incepted Walton Amateur Regatta, and co-organises its merged-with-Weybridge Regatta successor Walton and Weybridge Regatta. It organises in its own right since 1978 Walton Small Boats Head, a major December event in the rowing calendar.\nThe club was the first to have competed at National Schools Regatta as a non-school club – this was in 1976.\nNotable members.\nThe most successful Senior international rower who trained almost contemporaneously at the club was Steve Trapmore, who stroked the winning Great Britain men's eight at the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics and won a World Championship title two years later in a GB four. He went on to retire with a back injury in 2003 and become a longstanding Olympic Rowing Programme and head Cambridge University coach. The club has for many decades taught to row and scull many juniors and adults.\nAfter the setting up of the Bisham and Caversham Lakes training centres, and advent of lottery funding, only a very small number of clubs in England see any training from the Great Britain squad members.\nMany former members, after Walton Rowing Club experience at national championship level and/or international events, have become part of the Great Britain squads, some having secured a university rowing scholarship or access to the regional elite start programmes. While members or recently re-affiliated, nine men's juniors between 2007 and 2013 were selected for World Juniors, or World U23s."

On the strength of this performance, manager Bill McKechnie declared Moore to be his starter going forward. However, Moore was hit by a pitch from Johnny Stuart of the St. Louis Cardinals on July 1, suffering a dislocated shoulder, and Traynor took advantage of Moore's absence to re-solidify his hold on the position.\nThe next season, after Rabbit Maranville was traded to the Chicago Cubs, Moore became the Pirates' starting second baseman. He injured his shoulder on May 8, but was forced back into the lineup at less than full strength after only a few days of rest because the father of his backup, Johnny Rutledge, had died unexpectedly.\nMoore was sold to the Boston Braves in 1926, after a confrontation with Fred Clarke, who was then working as the Pirates' assistant manager and head of scouting. The trouble began during a doubleheader against the New York Giants on July 12. Moore committed an error in the first game, and was booed by the crowd. He had a habit of reflexively smiling during moments of stress, and when Clarke saw his grin, he took it to be a sign that Moore did not care about what he was doing. The two got into a shouting match in the dugout after the end of the inning, with Moore telling Clarke to \"get off the bench\". That game was Moore's last with the Pirates. That evening, McKechnie fined Moore and pitcher Emil Yde for what he termed \"indifferent play\", and on July 20 the team sold Moore to the Braves.\nOn September 27, 1930, Moore became the last major-league player to hit a \"bounce\" home run. (Prior to the 1931 season, a ball that bounced from the field of play into the outfield stands was considered a home run.)\nMoore helped lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a Southern Association championship in 1933, batting .309 as the team's starting shortstop.\nin 748 games over 10 seasons in his major league career, Moore posted a .285 batting average (706-for-2474) with 360 runs, 108 doubles, 26 triples, 13 home runs, 257 RBI, 52 stolen bases, 272 bases on balls, .359 on-base percentage and .366 slugging percentage. He finished his career with an overall .953 fielding percentage. In the 1925 World Series, he hit .231 (6-for-26) with 7 runs, 1 double, 1 home run, 2 RBI and 5 walks."

        "text": "The Union League Golf and Country Club of San Francisco (now called Green Hills Country Club) was constructed in 1929 (opening in 1930) in Millbrae, California, United States. It was one of the most ambitious golf and country club projects of its era in Northern California. It was conceived in the prosperous time that proceeded the Great Depression by a prominent group of San Francisco businessmen (primarily Union League of San Francisco club members) who would spare no expense during the design-phase of the project. The golf course was designed by Alister MacKenzie who considered it one of the top three courses on the West Coast. The unforeseen economic downturn of the Great Depression caused the club to become financially insolvent and in 1933 it was reorganized as Millbrae Country Club. In 1945 the club was named Green Hills Country Club.\nSearch for the site.\nThe Union League members began searching for a site to build a world-class facility in the 1920s. They spent years looking for a property that was: [1] near the city of San Francisco, [2] land suitable for the construction of a championship golf course, [3] property with a natural water supply, and [4] weather that was outside of the fog belt. In 1927 they found the ideal site for the club in the hills above a small town on the San Francisco Peninsula, Millbrae. The site featured very fertile land, in fact the property had been cultivated as a nursery for many decades. Flowers and shrubs grown on the property were actually utilized by famed horticulturist John MacLaren in the 1915 Pan Pacific Exposition, or World's Fair. The property had year-round water (from natural creeks), and undulating topography featuring gorgeous vistas. The property could be reached from San Francisco by the members’ automobiles traveling down a road that led to the Peninsula, the El Camino Real.\nDesign team.\nAfter the land was secured the Union League selected a design team that could build a world-class golf course, and a modern clubhouse. The Union League members would spare no expense in the golf and building architects.\nThe members of the future Union League Golf and Country Club retained renowned golf course architect Alister MacKenzie to design an 18-hole golf course on the property. MacKenzie would be aided by two-time U.S. Amateur Champion Henry Chandler Egan and collegiate champion Robert Hunter.\nThe prestigious design firm of Willis Polk and Company was chosen as the clubhouse architect. Willis Polk and Company were highly acclaimed and responsible for many architectural gems throughout Northern California. Willis Polk, who was considered the architectural mastermind of the rebuilding of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake, died in 1924. His architectural firm, however carried on in his tradition and developed the plans for the Union League Golf and Country Club structure. The chief architect in charge of the project was Angus McSweeney.\nMacKenzie, with help from Hunter and Egan, utilized the existing topography and with minimal grading sculpted an 18-hole layout that would soon draw rave reviews as a world-class golf course. The course featured some of the most undulating greens ever built and the bunkering rivaled recently completed Cypress Point in Monterey. According to news accounts, \"No expense has been spared to build the best. As witness of that, the piping is of cast iron. But one other course in Northern California has that, it is said\".\nThe opening.\nThe San Francisco press covered the April 27, 1930, opening day events and gave glowing reviews to the golf course, calling it \"happy valley\" and \"the equal of anything in Northern California.\" A local newspaper indicated \"MacKenzie, in fact, was loud in praise of the topography of the acreage, and declares it one of his best pieces of work, which is ample praise, coming from the reticent Englishman.\"\nGroundbreaking of The Union League Golf and Country Club took place on January 6, 1929, ten months prior to the crash of the Stock Market. Although the course was ready for play in January 1930, the members voted to delay opening until \"all possibility of damage to the greens by premature use\" had been eliminated. (There was also a \"washout\" on the first fairway that required of \"drain tile\" prior to the opening).\nThe Golf Course officially opened to considerable fanfare on April 27, 1930, when more than 200 golfers teed off at the new golf course that the press called \"one of the finest in California\". The first ceremonial ball was hit from a silver tee by Samuel Welfield, the club's vice president, as the president, William J. Bevan, was out of town.\nThe San Francisco Press reported, \"The course measures from the middle tees , and from Champion tees, . There are two routes to each hole, after the typical MacKenzie fashion, for the dub and star alike.\" They went on to say, \"The acreage, which used to be a nursery, still bears the resemblance. On several of the fairways the roughs are fruit tree orchards. The entire are bordered and dotted by cypress, pine, oak, redwood and other variety of trees. Over 100,000 saplings are being nursed for further beautification of the land.\"\nIn 1930 a prominent sign was placed at the corner of El Camino Real and Ludeman Lane. The words \"Union League Golf and Country Club West could be seen by anyone on El Camino Real. A picture of the sign, with the 16 Mile House (at its original location) in the background, was included in the Sunday August 10, 1930, issue of the San Francisco Chronicle. Opening of the Union League Golf Course was the feature story on the front page of the newspaper.\nThe cost of building the golf course, including MacKenzie’s fee, amounted to $140,000. The cost to purchase the land was $250,000. The clubhouse and furnishing generated another $150,000 which brought the total cost to approximately $540,000.\nThe contractor for the clubhouse project was Charles T. Magill, a member of the Union League Club in San Francisco. Magill won the \"opening day\" golf tournament.\nThe original fee to join the Union League Club was $1,250 with membership limited to 300.\nThe opening gala dedication and dinner dance was held on August 23, 1930. The San Mateo Times reported that \"Over three hundred members and their friends gathered in the new building which is one of the finest country clubs in California, and enjoyed the delightful entertainment prepared by the inauguration committee.\"\nThe times went on to report, \"W.J. Bevan, Burlingame resident and vice-president of the Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco is president of the club and has directed the details of construction which brings to the Peninsula a new golf course and clubhouse that is a real asset to the community. The new club is complete in every detail that could add to the comfort and pleasure of the members. It is a structure of charming architecture and embodies every modern facility of an up to date clubhouse.\"\nThe first head professional was Harry Kennett. Sam Smith, a former Harding Park starter, was the first \"starter\" and assistant Club Manager. The first Club Manager was C.L. Westlake.\nMacKenzie and the design team.\nAlister MacKenzie was acknowledged to be one of the three leading golf course architects of his day (along with A. W. Tillinghast and Donald Ross) and was the author of Golf Course Design which told of his design philosophy. MacKenzie influenced countless architects from that time to the present. He also wrote The Spirit of St. Andrews, which became the famous \"lost manuscript\" until it was rediscovered and published long after his death in 1934.\nRobert Hunter was a good golfer and a socialite with \"connections\" that helped bring attention to various MacKenzie course design projects. He oversaw construction of the course in collaboration with MacKenzie. His gregarious manner also helped to build membership after the club was formed. Moreover, Hunter was a devotee of links-style golf courses and published a seminal book on golf course architecture titled Links.\nH. Chandler Egan, was a golfing champion of national stature having won the U. S. Amateur Championship in 1904 and 1905 and the Pacific Northwest championship in 1915, 1920, 1923, 1925 and 1932. He was also an accomplished architect in his own right, having designed several outstanding courses in Oregon. He also achieved considerable acclaim for his remodeling of Pebble Beach Golf Links in preparation for the 1929 U. S. Amateur Championship. He redesigned the greens and bunkering giving them a ragged, natural seaside look that was very dramatic. (It is worth noting that Egan finished second in that 1929 U.S. Amateur Championship). MacKenzie, however, redesigned the eighth hole which has been acclaimed as one of the great par fours of the world. Significantly, Bobby Jones was defeated early in that 1929 championship which led to his visiting Cypress Point and Pasatiempo. These visits prompted Bobby Jones to select Mackenzie for the design of Augusta National in place of Donald Ross and a tradition was born.\nEconomic realities.\nBy 1933 economic reality set in and the Union League Golf and Country Club filed for bankruptcy. The club was reorganized as semi-private Millbrae Golf and Country Club. During the period around World War II many of the original MacKenzie bunkers were filled in (a cost-cutting measure that occurred in golf courses throughout America) and sodded over. In 1945 Millbrae Golf and County Club became the private Green Hills Country Club, which it remains to this day.\nDuring the 1990s many of the original MacKenzie design features (and bunkers) were restored."

        "text": "John Henry Kramer (January 5, 1918 – May 18, 1995) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball who played with four different teams between 1939 and 1951. Listed at , , Kramer batted and threw right-handed. He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nKramer pitched 16 seasons from 1936 to 1959, twelve in the major leagues and six in the minors. He entered the majors in 1939 with the St. Louis Browns, playing for them three years before joining the U.S. Navy Seabees during World War II. Following his service discharge, he rejoined the Browns in the 1943 midseason and later was demoted to the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. On September 11, he pitched a 5–0 no-hitter against the Louisville Colonels. He struggled with his control in his first four years (201 walks in 345.0 IP), but received a fifth chance in part to the World War II player shortage. He responded with a heroic effort that culminated in the Browns only World Series appearance.\nIn 1944, Kramer led the Browns to their 8th straight Opening Day victory‚ beating Dizzy Trout and Detroit‚ 2–1, at Tiger Stadium. A week later, he extended the Browns season-opening winning streak to six games defeating the White Sox, 5–2, aiding his cause with a two-run home run. In his next start, he pitches the Browns to their American League record 9th straight win to start the season with a 3–1 victory over the Indians, which gave his team a solid 3 game lead in the AL standings. Kramer finished with a 17–13 record and a 2.49 ERA, including a brilliant one-hitter shutout over the White Sox in September that gave St. Louis a half-game lead in front of the Yankees. The Browns finished with an 89–65 record and faced the Cardinals in the historic All-St. Louis World Series. Kramer added a complete-game victory in Game Three, allowing just two unearned runs on seven hits and 10 strikeouts. This would be the last time the hapless Browns won a postseason game.\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Kramer averaged 11 wins per season and made the American League All-Star team three times. In the 1946 Game he tossed three no-hit, shutout innings to earn a save. In addition, he went one-for-one and scored a run. In November 1947, he was sent along Vern Stephens to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Pete Layden, Joe Ostrowski, Roy Partee, Eddie Pellagrini, Al Widmar, Jim Wilson and cash.\nIn 1948, Kramer went 18–5 for Boston, including a 12-game winning streak from June 3 to August 10 and five victories over the Yankees. His .783 won–loss percentage led the American League pitchers. He faded to 6–8 in 1949 and was sold the New York Giants for $25‚000. Eventually, Kramer will charge the Red Sox with railroading him out of the league because of his differences with manager Joe McCarthy. He went 1–3 for the Giants (1950–51) and 1–3 with the Yankees (1951). Although he pitched with both pennant-winners in 1951, he did not last to the World Series with either.\nIn a 12-season career, Kramer posted a 95–103 record with 613 strikeouts and a 4.24 ERA in 322 appearances, including 215 starts, 88 complete games, 14 shutouts, seven saves and 1637 innings of work. He also helped himself with the bat, hitting .144 (72-for-501) with five home runs, 39 RBI and 76 bases on balls.\nKramer died in Metairie, Louisiana at age 77 of a cerebral hemorrhage in a hospital in Metairie, Louisiana."

It saw the \"EHC Waldkraiburg\" take out its second Bavarian title, having previously won it in 1987–88, then under the name of \"VfL Waldkraiburg\". The club could have taken up promotion to the Oberliga but declined. The \"EV Weiden\" voluntarily withdrew from the \"Oberliga\" while \"Regensburg\" was forced to resign from the \"2nd Bundesliga\" due to insolvency.\nThe \"Bayernliga\" season saw the \"EC Ulm/Neu-Ulm\" fold after 16 rounds, unable to complete its schedule.\nNo team remained unbeaten this season, the \"ESC Kempten\" in the \"Bezirksliga West\" held the best record with 19 wins and one defeat. Two teams, both from the \"Bezirksliga\", remained winless all season, the \"SG München\" and the \"TSV Trostberg II\". For the latter, it was the second winless season in a row, having only ever won one game since joining the league in 2005.\nChampions.\nThe three levels of the Bavarian league system were won by the following teams:\nBayernliga.\nPlay-Offs.\nThe first round of the play-offs was carried out in a best-of-five modus, after that it went to a best-of-three. The winner of the final is crowned \"Bayrischer Meister\" (English: \"Bavarian champions\").\nPlay-Downs.\nThe first round of the play-offs was carried out in a best-of-five modus, after that it went to a best-of-three. The \"EC Ulm/Neu-Ulm\" did not play any games, all games were awarded to the opposition. The two teams in the final are relegated to the \"Landesligas\".\nLandesliga.\nThe four regional divisions played out a home-and-away round to determine the two clubs from each league who enter the eight-team promotion round, The top two teams of this round gain promotion to the \"Bayernliga\". Should one or more teams from this league move up to the \"Oberliga\" without a Bavarian team being relegated from there, additional clubs from that round may gain promotion.\nThe remaining six clubs in each league played out a relegation round with the last team in each of the four groups being relegated to the \"Bezirksliga\".\nFrom season to season, clubs can be moved between divisions to geographically balance out promotion and relegation. This explains, why three of the \"Landesligas\" have two newly promoted teams each while the western division has none in the 2007–08 season. The fact that six clubs moved up from the \"Bezirksliga\" to the \"Landesliga\" from the previous season results from the fact that four teams were promoted to the \"Bayernliga\" the previous season and therefore extra places were available to fill.\nFirst round.\nTop two teams enter the \"promotion round\".\nPromotion round.\nTop two teams promoted to the \"Bayernliga\".\nRelegation round.\nNo points were taken from the first rounds competition. The bottom team in each group was relegated to the \"Bezirksliga\", except the \"EK München\", which was not.\nBezirksliga.\nThe four regional divisions played out a home-and-away round to determine the league winner. The four league champions are promoted to the \"Landesliga\" and also are qualified for the \"Bezirksliga\" championship round.\nMain round.\nThe first-place team entered the championship round and was promoted to \"Landesliga\". In addition, EHC Regensburg was promoted as best runner-up, taking the spot of the folded EC Ulm/Neu Ulm.\nChampionship round.\nThe \"Bezirksliga\" championship was decided in a home-and-away round with the club with the best aggregate score taking out the series.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nJohnson signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as a non-drafted free agent on June 29, 2002, out of Thatcher High School in Thatcher, Arizona and began his professional career with the Princeton Devil Rays rookie level team in Princeton, West Virginia. In 2005, he played for the Visalia Oaks of Visalia, California (A class A minor-league affiliate of the Devil Rays). In the same season, Johnson got promoted to class AA with the Montgomery Biscuits, then in 2007 moved to the Durham Bulls to play with the class AAA minor league affiliate.\nJohnson made the Tampa Bay Rays opening day roster for the 2008 season. On April 5, 2008, he made his debut against the New York Yankees as the team's designated hitter. He had four at bats and recorded his first major league hit, a single off of Andy Pettitte. He had three hits in 19 at-bats over seven games for the Devil Rays that season before he was sent back down to Durham. He spent the next two seasons in the minors, missing two months in 2009 with a fractured thumb. In 2010, he hit .319 for Durham and was selected to appear in the Triple-A All-Star game. He was also named the Bulls most valuable player.\nJohn Romano of \"St. Petersburg Times\" wrote in March 2011 that he was likely one of three players competing for two spots on the Rays bench, with the other two being outfielder Sam Fuld and first baseman Casey Kotchman. Johnson made the opening day roster, along with Fuld. On May 15, 2011, he hit his first major league home run against Baltimore Orioles pitcher Jake Arrieta. On August 12, 2011, he was one of 5 Rays to hit solo home runs off CC Sabathia in a 5-1 Tampa Bay victory. Johnson was designated for assignment on February 5, 2013. In part of three seasons with the Devil Rays/Rays, he hit .223 with 10 homers and 50 RBI.\nKansas City Royals.\nJohnson was acquired by the Kansas City Royals on February 12, 2013, from the Rays as the player to be named later in the James Shields trade. He was designated for assignment on August 15, 2013 and released on August 19. In 79 games, he hit .179.\nAtlanta Braves.\nJohnson was claimed off waivers by the Atlanta Braves on August 21, 2013. He played in his first game as a Brave on the same day. In his first four at bats, Johnson singled twice. He hit his first RBI as a Brave three days later on August 25, 2013. After the season, Johnson was non-tendered by the Braves, making him a free agent. In 32 games, he hit .261.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn January 27, 2014, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. The contract included an invitation to Major League Spring Training. On March 22, it was announced that Johnson had made the opening day roster, however he was designated for assignment on May 3, after appearing in just seven games with two hits (both doubles) in 19 at-bats. Johnson cleared waivers on May 9, and was sent to the Triple–A Columbus Clippers. He elected free agency in October 2014.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nJohnson signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers on February 23, 2015. On March 31, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for cash considerations. The Dodgers assigned him to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers, where he played in 55 games and had a batting average of .244."

The team brought to Duke their first national championship when they defeated Kansas 72–65. Duke would win the championship again the following year, making Duke the first team since UCLA in 1973 to win back-to-back titles.\nExpectations.\nThe Blue Devils had ended the 1990 season with a record-setting 30-point loss to the UNLV Runnin' Rebels in the national championship game (103–73). After losing seniors Phil Henderson, Alaa Abdelnaby, and Robert Brickey to graduation, Duke welcomed a new addition to the team, freshman Grant Hill.\nRegular season.\nWith junior Christian Laettner and sophomore Bobby Hurley leading the way, Duke placed third at the Preseason NIT (behind Arizona and Arkansas). The Blue Devils went on to compile a 25–6 regular season record, including a perfect 16–0 mark at home. Scoring victories in both rivalry matches against North Carolina and sporting an 11–3 conference record, Duke also captured their 9th regular-season championship in school history.\nConference tournament.\nDuke entered the ACC tournament as a No. 1 seed, but stumbled in the ACC title game against North Carolina by a score of 96–74, even though the Blue Devils had defeated the Tar Heels twice during the regular season. As a result, North Carolina received the top seed in the East Regional, leaving Duke with a No. 2 seed in the Midwest Regional of the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nDuke however tore through the Midwest Regional, defeating St. John's to join UNLV, Kansas, and rival North Carolina in the Final Four in Indianapolis. Entering the semifinal game against UNLV, the Blue Devils were facing an undefeated and top-ranked Runnin' Rebels squad that boasted a 45-game winning streak and featured National Player of the Year Larry Johnson. In one of the biggest upsets in Final Four history, however, Duke got its revenge from a year ago by a score of 79–77 after Laettner hit two free throws with 12 seconds remaining and UNLV guard Anderson Hunt missed a three-point attempt at the end-of-game buzzer.\nAn all-ACC, Duke vs. UNC title game was averted when Roy Williams coached his Kansas Jayhawks team to victory over his mentor Dean Smith and his Tar Heels squad. In what would become the first of many matchups between Williams (later head coach at North Carolina until his retirement in 2021) and Mike Krzyzewski, Duke finally claimed its first national championship by a score of 72–65. Laettner was named NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=8 style=| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=8 style=| NCAA Tournament"

        "text": "Capital Kids' Cricket (CKC) is an initiative and a charity based in London, to promote the playing of cricket in state schools in the capital of the United Kingdom.\nOrigins.\nIn Britain, but especially London, during the 1970s and the 1980s the teaching and playing of cricket was dying in schools funded by the state, for many complex reasons and by 1990 only 20 out of more than 800 such schools in London were playing the game. The teaching of cricket has declined throughout England in recent years, but the issue is compounded in London as there are few local teams with their own grounds on which children can be taught. To counter this lack of interest, CKC was set up by two Yorkshiremen William Greaves and Hayden Turner, who have a passion for cricket, and were concerned at its decline.\nPosition today.\nNow more than half the schools in London teach cricket, and promote the ethos that the game has traditionally provided. Volunteers have been found to help develop the sport in schools, and annual competitions have been arranged with the winners playing their final at the MCC Indoor School at Lord's Cricket Ground.\nSupport.\nThe charity is sponsored both corporately and individually, and especially with the help of active and retired cricketers. The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, Lord's Taverners, British Land plc, Sportsmatch and the MCC support in various ways. Individuals are invited to join the Heavy Rollers, a little joke suggesting that they possess money and propel the heavy roller used to flatten the cricket wicket. The Heavy Rollers are led by Head Groundsman, Clive Lloyd, the ex-West Indies captain and assistant head groundsmen, who are senior cricketers such as Mike Brearley, Roland Butcher, Donald Carr, Mike Denness, Ted Dexter, Paul Downton, John Edrich, Keith Fletcher, Angus Fraser, Mike Gatting, Graham Gooch, David Gower, Tom Graveney, Tony Lewis, Brian Luckhurst, Alec Stewart, Bob Willis and Don Wilson.\nOthers can join on the payment of a small contribution.\n20th anniversary.\nIn 2010 the charity celebrated its 20th anniversary. At a well attended bash at the HQ of Westminster City Council, a celebration was held, attended by seven mayors of London Boroughs wearing their insignias of office – their mayoral chains – who informally and affectionately refer to themselves as the chain gang."

        "title": "Robert Brewer (American football)",
        "text": "Robert Brewer is a former American football player. He played quarterback for the University of Texas Longhorns during the 1981 and 1982 season. He is the last walk-on quarterback to start for Texas and the last to start in the Cotton Bowl. His most memorable moment was the late touchdown he scored against Alabama to guide Texas to a 1982 Cotton Bowl Classic win. He is also the younger member of the only father-son combination to start at quarterback for Texas. Both father and son led Longhorn teams to victory over Bear Bryant coached teams (Charley against Texas A&amp;M in 1954 and 1955 and Robert against Alabama in 1982).\nHigh school.\nRobert Brewer came from a football family. His father, Charles Brewer had been the starting quarterback at Texas from 1953–55 and his uncle George Brewer had played in the starting backfield with Darrell Royal at Oklahoma. A Richardson, Texas native, Brewer was barely recruited out of high school, and received no scholarship offers.\nCollege career.\nNever recruited by the school he loved, Brewer drove to Austin and convinced Coach Fred Akers to give him a shot. He made the Longhorns football team as a walk-on. Later he was awarded a scholarship and finally got his chance halfway through his junior season.\nIn 1980, he backed up Donnie Little but played in only one game, against TCU. It was during the 1981 season that Brewer became the starter. Texas won its first four games and became the consensus #1 team in the country with Rick McIvor at quarterback. During that time, Brewer played only a handful of downs. But then they lost badly to unranked Arkansas, with McIvor throwing 4 interceptions, allowing Brewer a chance to play in that game. A few weeks later, with Texas losing to Houston 14-0, Brewer went in for an injured McIvor and was able to rally the team to a 14-14 tie, completing 8 of 20 passes for 93 yards including the game-tying two-point conversion to tailback John Walker. Brewer became the team's starter and led them to three straight wins, a #6 ranking, a slim chance at the National Championship and a spot in the Cotton Bowl in place of conference champion Southern Methodist, who was on probation and ineligible that year.\nThe 1981 Cotton Bowl was arguably Brewer's best game. Down 10-0 in the 4th quarter against #3 Alabama, Brewer got the Longhorns down to Alabama's 30 yard line and then, on a QB draw play called \"one\" that wasn't even in the playbook, ran 30 yards for a touchdown. It was his longest running play of his career. Texas got the ball back a few minutes later and Brewer led the Longhorns 80 yards down the field, hitting four straight passes of 37, 10, 19, and 10 yards before Terry Orr ran it in from the 8-yard line for the game-winning touchdown. Texas finished 10-1-1 with a final No. 3 National Ranking.\nIn 1982, Brewer threw for 12 TDs and set UT records for attempts and yardage, and tied the mark for completions. Texas finished 9-2 that year and went to the Sun Bowl. But five days before that game, Brewer suffered a broken thumb in practice, ending his career one game early. His last game was an upset win at home against #6 Arkansas.\nHe went 13-2 as a starter.\nLater life.\nAfter graduation, Brewer went to work in the private sector before returning to UT as Assistant Athletic Director for development for seven years. He was in charge of raising funds through the Longhorn Foundation. He then became a financial adviser for Merrill Lynch in Austin. He is married to Laura Moerschell, the sister of former Texas quarterback Rob Moerschell.\nOne of Brewer's sons, Michael, graduated from high school as one of the top quarterback recruits in the United States for the 2011 Recruiting year. He went to Texas Tech, but after the 2013-14 season he announced his plans to transfer. He considered transferring to Texas, but was denied his transfer request by Texas Tech. He instead went to Virginia Tech, where he became the starting quarterback for the 2014 and 2015 seasons.\nAnother son, Charlie, is also a quarterback. In 2017, he began playing at Baylor and nearly led them to a come-from-behind upset of #23 West Virginia."

        "text": "Rugby union in Cuba is a minor sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe Cuban Rugby Union is the governing body for rugby union in the Cuba. It was founded in 1996.\nHistory.\nRugby was played by famous Argentinian revolutionaries Alberto Granado and Che Guevara. After meeting through the game and going on to tour South America (see \"The Motorcycle Diaries\") the pair would settle in Cuba and become national heroes. Alberto Granado later became Cuban's Rugby first Patron and helped develop the sport in the Country where it had not been traditionally played.\nDuring the 1990s and first decade of this century Rugby slowly developed with the involvement of several touring teams from foreign countries such as Canada and France. These teams helped to provide both coaching and much needed equipment. With no olympic support at this time, Cuban rugby had no financial backing from the government with teams often playing under precarious conditions with no changing rooms, goal posts and even no markings on the pitch.\nIn 2002 the Cuban Rugby Union organized the Cuban Rugby Championship for the first time, with both a 15 a side and sevens tournament.\nFirst IRB Sanctioned Tournament.\nIn 2010 Havana hosted an 8-team International Rugby Sevens tournament, the first IRB sanctioned tournament to be performed in the country. The tournament was a big success, receiving coverage from the national press—introducing many Cubans to the sport who previously knew nothing of the game. The Cuban national team beat Mexico, showing a big improvement in playing standards on the Island but then lost to a US select side named Atlantis 0-15. The tournament also featured 3 Cuban development sides.\nAs of 2010 Cuban rugby is still lacking financial backing despite rugby sevens recently being given Olympic status. It is hoped this will change in the future.\nIn 2016 the first multi-team veterans (over 35s) rugby tournament was played in Cuba. The Copa de Amistad (Friendship Cup) was organised by a small group of Australians led by Rowan Ward, and assisted by Cuban 'rugbyistas' Osmel Hernandez and Leonid Baro, who the Australians had met and befriended in earlier trips to the Caribbean island. Played over 6 days 29 Oct to 4 Nov 2016 the tournament was a big success, with 8 teams participating from Cuba, Australia, USA (California and Colorado), Canada, Chile and Israel. There was also a barbarians team with strong representation from Argentina. The presence of the Israeli team, the Elders of Zion, was reportedly the first sporting team from Israel to tour Cuba in over 50 years. The tournament raised over US$10,000 in funds and materials supporting Cuban youth rugby, a project for adolescents with Downs Syndrome in Havana (Petalos de Amor) and the introduction of a science-based sustainable development course in universities in central Cuba."

In 1934, the Moscow Championship was started, and in 1936, the first Soviet Championship took place.\nIn 1949, rugby union was forbidden in the USSR during the \"fight against the cosmopolitanism\". The competitions were resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship in 1966. In 1975, the Soviet national team played their first match.\nRugby union appears to have been introduced to the Moldavian SSR in 1967.\nMoldova had its own rugby team in the USSR, but it was not treated as a proper national side.\nPost-independence.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the popularity of rugby in Moldova is growing rapidly, with well over 10,000 fans regularly turning up to their home matches in the European Nations Cup. Since 2004, the number of Moldovan rugby players has more than doubled, due to the national team's growing international reputation. Rugby union in Romania is quite a major sport, going back ninety years, and as Moldova shares language and a border with Romania, this has helped its popularity in the country.\nNational team.\nThe Moldova national rugby union team represents Moldova in international rugby union matches.

        "title": "Newt fencing",
        "text": "Newt fencing is a barrier designed to control the movement of great crested newts, other amphibians or reptiles. It can also be called drift fencing or temporary amphibian fencing (TAF). It consists of a low fence of plastic sheeting, buried a short way into the ground and supported by lightweight posts usually made of wood or plastic. It is used to keep animals out of working areas, to keep them inside safe areas of their habitat, to intercept migration routes, or to control their movement to help their capture for translocation. It may be used in conjunction with pitfall traps placed at the foot of the fence. It is most commonly used in connection with building projects, to minimise harm to protected species.\nBackground.\nLegislation.\nThe great crested newt (\"Triturus cristatus\") is an amphibian native to the United Kingdom but also widespread across Northern Europe. Whilst it is relatively widespread in the UK (in fact the UK hosts one of the great crested newt's most significant populations), it is rare on a European wide basis. The great crested newt is listed as a \"strictly protected fauna species\" under appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats:\nand consequently is protected under UK legislation through the Wildlife and Countryside Act and the Conservation (Natural Habitat) regulations 1994. Under these regulations it is an offence to intentionally disturb, injure or kill any great crested newt, or disturb or destroy its habitat. Likewise, the Habitats Regulations 2010 do not apply to all newts, and in the case of e.g. smooth newt species, they are protected differently, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\nHabitat.\nThe great crested newt's natural habitat requirements are standing fresh water for breeding purposes, but the majority of its time is spent on dry land. They favour semi-natural habitats such as rough grassland, hedgerows and scrub woodland. An individual newt tends to have a range centred upon its breeding pool. The breeding stage of the life cycle takes place in spring, from February through to April. After this it spends much of its time on land, usually within from the breeding pond, but sometimes ranging up to . Unfortunately this life cycle and the use of both terrestrial and aquatic habitats may put the newts into conflict with humans. Brownfield sites often contain very good terrestrial habitat for great crested newts, and land within from newt breeding ponds includes a significant proportion of the UK.\nPlanning.\nAs part of the planning process for any development, an environmental impact assessment should include an ecological survey, which should in turn identify the potential for loss of habitat and the impact on the local population of great crested newts. If the assessment identifies possible loss of habitat or the potential to kill or disturb individual newts, it will be necessary for the developer to apply to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for a licence. The licence application should set out what measures will be taken to ensure that the local population is not threatened, and how potential loss of habitat can be mitigated.\nFencing and trapping.\nTo ensure that individual newts are not injured or killed by development activities, it may be necessary to enclose the site in a newt proof fence, trap the individuals within the site and/or remove them to a suitable release site. As the great crested newt is a European strictly protected fauna species, erection of newt fencing or any capture of the animals requires a licence.\nConstruction.\nThe newt fence usually consists of a plastic membrane partially buried in the ground (usually to about ) The above ground portion being supported by timber stakes placed at regular intervals along the line of the fence. The fence normally has a below ground horizontal return facing out of the site to minimise the risk of newts re-entering the site through the disturbed soil layer. It usually has some form of overhang along the top edge to reduce the possibility of newts climbing over the fence.\nNewt fencing types.\nFences tend to fall into three basic categories, temporary (less than two years lifespan), semi-permanent (two to five years lifespan) and permanent (greater than two years lifespan). The materials used to construct them tend to vary with the length of time the fence is to remain operable. A temporary fence is normally constructed from UV-stabilised polythene sheet or woven geotextile. Semi-permanent fences are usually constructed from 1mm thick plastic panels. Permanent fences are usually constructed from rigid plastic or galvanised steel panels. In the case of temporary fencing materials, the underground return is created by folding the material at a ° angle along the base of the trench, and the top overhang by rolling the top edge of the membrane over a number of times to create a roll. For permanent fencing, the underground return is sometimes omitted and instead the fence is buried deeper (usually ). The top overhang is created by making a fold in the material at the manufacturing stage.\nNewt collection and trapping.\nTrapping is undertaken through the use of buried buckets (pitfall traps) placed alongside the fence material. The idea being that the newts follow the fence along until they fall into the open bucket. Carpet tiles (terrestrial refuges) may be used in conjunction with pitfall traps. Again these are placed alongside the fence and provide ideal shelter for newts whilst they are resting (daytime and during dry or cold periods).\nOnce an ecologist is satisfied that all of the newts have been trapped from the site and that the terms of the licence have been met, construction work can begin."

The round was dominated by Darren Clarke, who posted a six-under 66. The score was even more impressive considering only seven shot under par for the round. Sergio García shot 69 (−3), in a second place tie with 2002 U.S. Amateur champion Ricky Barnes. Three-time major champion, Nick Price, shot 70 (−2), for a fourth place tie with Canadian Mike Weir. Two-time defending champ and three-time Masters champion, Tiger Woods shot a disappointing 76 (+4), ten strokes back.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 11, 2003\"\n\"Saturday, April 12, 2003\"\nDue to the postponement of play on Thursday, the second round started at 2 pm on Friday with players starting at the 1st and 10th tees. In what proved to be another very difficult round at Augusta, Weir took a four stroke 36-hole lead with a four-under 68 for 138 (−6). Only 16 of the 93 competitors finished with a round below par, and only four were under par at the halfway mark. First round leader Clarke came back to earth with 76 (+4) for solo second at 142 (−2). Phil Mickelson charged up the leaderboard with a two-under 70 into a tie for third place with amateur Barnes. (Two other amateurs also made the cut, Hunter Mahan and Ryan Moore.) Five were tied for fifth place at even-par 144, including two former Masters champions in Vijay Singh and José María Olazábal. The round was completed on Saturday morning and the 36-hole cut was set at 149 (+5). The biggest name to fail to make the weekend was Colin Montgomerie.\nAmateurs: \"Barnes (-1), Mahan (+1), Moore (+3)\", Larrázabal (+19), Zahringer (+23).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 12, 2003\"\nFollowing the completion of the second round on Saturday morning, \"Moving day\" lived up to its name in the third round as Jeff Maggert charged to the 54-hole lead with a six-under 66 for 211 (−5). Second round leader Weir shot 75 (+3) to fall back to 213 (−3), in solo second place and the final Sunday pairing with Maggert. Singh moved into a tie for third with another major champion in David Toms at 214 (−2). Woods matched the round of the day with a 66 (−6) to ascend the leaderboard to keep his bid for three-straight Masters alive. Mickelson and Olazábal were tied with Woods at 215 for fifth place. Len Mattiace shot 69 (−3) to get to even-par 216, five strokes back in a tie for eighth. The third round was completed late on Saturday, and the tournament was finally back on schedule. \nSource:\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 13, 2003\"\nSummary.\nDespite one of the largest major championship final round comebacks by Mattiace, Mike Weir bested him in a sudden death playoff for his first major title. Weir became the first Canadian male ever to win a major championship, and also became the first left-handed player to win the Masters. The sudden death playoff at the par 4 10th was the only extra hole needed, as Weir's bogey was good enough as Mattiace double-bogeyed the hole. Weir recovered from his disappointing third round with his second 68 of the tournament to force the playoff. To get into the sudden death playoff, Weir made a putt for par on the 18th green. Mattiace's only bogey (besides the playoff hole) of his tournament-low 65 (−7) was at the 18th hole. He teed off forty minutes and four groups ahead of the final pairing, so Mattiace had about an hour between the completion of his round and the start of the playoff.\nThird round leader Maggert shot a disappointing 75 (+3) to finish in solo fifth place. Maggert had no bogeys or double bogeys, but made a triple bogey 7 on the third hole and a quintuple bogey 8 on the twelfth hole. Mickelson's 68 (−4) was only enough for solo third, two strokes behind Weir and Mattiace. It marked Mickelson's third straight third-place finish at the Masters (he would win the green jacket in 2004, 2006, and 2010). Jim Furyk also shot a four-under 68 for a fourth-place finish which equaled his best Masters finish at 284 (−4). (He would win the next major, at the U.S. Open in June.) Ernie Els and Singh rounded out the under par finishers at 287 (−1), in a tie for sixth. Toms shot 74 and fell back to even-par 288, in a five-way tie for eighth. Woods' bid for his third straight Masters victory came up well short with a disappointing 75 (+3) for 290 (+2), nine strokes back. Amateur Barnes was the low-amateur, after being near the top of the leaderboard the first two rounds.\nThis was the last year the sudden-death playoff began on the 10th tee. Beginning in 2004, the playoff starting point was changed to the 18th hole, which then alternated with the 10th hole until a winner emerged; the first use was in 2005.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "text": "The 1978 Masters Tournament was the 42nd Masters Tournament, held April 6–9 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Gary Player overcame a 7-shot deficit going into the final round to win his third Masters and ninth major championship. Player, age 42, shot a record-tying 64 (−8) in the final round to win by one stroke. The runners-up were Rod Funseth, defending champion Tom Watson, and 54-hole leader Hubert Green, the reigning U.S. Open champion, who shot an even-par 72.\nTied for tenth place at the start of the round, Player shot a 30 on the back nine in the summer-like heat. He holed seven putts ranging from , including a final one of for birdie at 18. The leader in the clubhouse, Player had to wait forty minutes for the final groups to finish. Funseth had five birdies, but his two bogeys were both three-putts and he parred the last three holes. Watson eagled 13 and birdied both 15 and 16, but missed an putt for par on the final hole. After a bogey at 16, Green hit an outstanding approach shot at 18 which left a birdie putt from three feet (0.9 m) to tie, but he missed after being inadvertently distracted by a radio announcer.\nPlayer became the oldest winner of the Masters and the first over forty in nearly a quarter century; Sam Snead won his third green jacket at age 41 in 1954.

        "text": "The 1979 Masters Tournament was the 43rd Masters Tournament, held April 12–15 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nFuzzy Zoeller won his only Masters, the first of his two major titles, with a birdie on the second hole of a playoff with Ed Sneed and Tom Watson. Jack Nicklaus climbed up the leaderboard on Sunday with a 69 (−3), but bogeyed 17 to finish a stroke out of the playoff; Tom Kite had a double bogey at 16 for an even par 72 in the final round to finish fifth, three strokes back.\nSecond and third round leader Sneed seemed to have a commanding three-shot lead with only three holes to go, but bogeyed the final three holes to card a final round 76 (+4) and fell into the playoff. It was the debut of the sudden-death format at Augusta, adopted by the Masters in 1976. Its last playoff was nine years earlier in 1970, then a full 18-hole round on Monday.\nThe sudden-death playoff began on the tenth hole, a downhill par-4, where all three players missed birdie putts and parred. On the second hole, the par-4 11th, Sneed failed to hole a bunker shot and Watson a birdie putt, and then Zoeller made his from to win.\nZoeller, age 27, was the first to win the Masters in his initial attempt since Gene Sarazen in 1935, the second edition of the tournament. In his fifth season on tour, it was Zoeller's second win, the first came less than three months earlier at the Andy Williams-San Diego Open Invitational. He won his other major five years later at the 1984 U.S. Open, also in a playoff.\nThe second round was suspended for two hours Friday afternoon due to heavy rain and tornado warnings. Due to the delay, not all golfers were able to complete their second rounds on Friday and the cut line was not determined until these rounds were completed on Saturday morning.

Ballesteros had a seven stroke lead after 54 holes and extended it to ten strokes after the front nine of the final round at 16-under-par, eyeing the Masters record of 271 (−17) set by Jack Nicklaus in 1965 (and equaled by Raymond Floyd in 1976). A new record (of 270 or lower) was to be rewarded with a $50,000 bonus from \"Golf\" magazine. An hour later, after he found the water at 12 and 13 at Amen Corner, the lead had been reduced to three. Ballesteros regrouped with a birdie at 15 and parred the rest to shoot even-par 72 for the round and held on for the victory.\nWell back in the field on Sunday, Nicklaus, age 40, was paired with Arnold Palmer, age 50, which drew large galleries. Palmer shot 69 to finish at even par and T24, Nicklaus had 73 to finish at 291 (+3) and T33. It was their first pairing at Augusta in five years and the first time Palmer had finished higher than Nicklaus there since 1967.

        "text": "James C. Lewis was an All-American lacrosse player at Navy from 1964 to 1966, leading the Midshipmen to national titles in each of his three years, as well as perfect seasons. Navy's national titles during these years were under the Wingate Memorial Trophy format where national champions were selected by committee.\nNavy career.\nIn 1966, \"The Baltimore Sun\" called Lewis the \"greatest living lacrosseman\". He is ranked fifth all-time in Navy men's lacrosse scoring with 169 career points. Lewis earned first-team All America honors all three years while in college, as well as being named the Jack Turnbull Award winner in 1964, 1965 and 1966. In 1965, Lewis led Navy to a 12 and 0 record while defeating Army 18-7 en route to the Midshipmen's fourth straight undisputed national championship. During this stretch Navy won 22nd games in a row. Lewis led Navy to three straight National Championships at a time when the top team was voted on by the USILA.\nThis is considered the greatest stretch of lacrosse in Navy lacrosse history, an eight-year period from 1960 through 1968, where Navy won outright or shared in eight straight national titles.\nLewis was elected to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1981, and is generally considered the top Navy lacrosse player of all time. He won the Navy's \"Sword For Men\" award in 1966 and also graduated from TOPGUN, the elite United States Navy Fighter Weapons School.\nLewis was All-American lacrosse player at Uniondale High School on Long Island, where he also played soccer. He still holds the single-game New York high school lacrosse record for points with 21.\nIn the 1964 NCAA Men's Soccer Championship finals against Michigan State, Lewis scored the game's only goal to help the Midshipmen to their only NCAA soccer title and was named Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nStatistics.\nStatistics are available on Navy Lacrosse media guides.

        "title": "Walbrook Rowing Club",
        "text": "Walbrook Rowing Club, colloquially sometimes named Teddington Rowing Club, is a rowing club, on the River Thames in England on the Middlesex bank 800 metres above Teddington Lock next to Trowlock Island, Teddington. It is the lowest club on the weir-controlled Thames (i.e. not the Tideway) and is the organising club for Teddington Head of the River Race held in November for all classes of racing shells.\nIt shares, in its sport, the quite broad Kingston and Ditton Reach which ends 6.4 kilometres upstream at Molesey Lock with Kingston Rowing Club, Tiffin, Tiffin Girls and Kingston Grammar Schools and has clubs in other watersports – principally canoeing, sailing and a skiff club.\nHistory.\nThe rowing club was originally established in Teddington in 1961 for BP employees, hence the club colours of green, yellow and black. In 1993 BP closed its Teddington leisure services site. Walbrook Rowing Club continued independently and acquired the site by pooling resources with the Royal Canoe Club and its associated watersports club, The Skiff Club to become the rowing section of 'Walbrook and Royal Canoe Club (RCC)'. Within weeks Kingston Royals Dragon Boat Racing Club joined the combined organisation.\nMembership.\nWalbook, early in the first decade of the 21st century, became on the transformation of its governing body, the recognised governing body in the sport, an open club to men and women of all backgrounds and members of Walbrook RC also become members of the RCC and have access to all the facilities on the site. Walbrook Rowing Club boat house is in a two-storey building (left of picture) and the Royal Canoe Club meanwhile reconstructed its clubhouse on Trowlock Island. \nThe rowing club aims to teach beginners to row and has a junior section for ages 12–18. There are a variety of races available to members of the club, and committed members can be expecting to race every other week or so during regatta season.\nPosition.\nWalbrook is the first non-tidal club on the weir-controlled Thames. The key feature of the non-tidal Thames compared to complex rules along the Tideway is that navigation is always on the right. In all but exceptional stream the water resembles the middle sections of a few wide rivers in the UK, being long weir-controlled rowing rivers in the UK capable of handling more than three large vessels side by side."

The NAIA headquarters also relocated to Olathe, Kansas this year.\nThe 65th annual NAIA basketball tournament featured 32 teams playing in a single-elimination format. The 2002 champion was 2001's runner-up, University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma. The Drovers faced Sooner Athletic Conference rival Oklahoma Baptist University in the championship game. It was the first time two teams from the Sooner Athletic Conference ever met in the national championship game. And the first SAC team to win the tournament since Oklahoma City University won in 1996. The Drovers rolled over the Bison 96–79. Finishing out the NAIA Semifinals were Azusa Pacific University and Barat College.\n2002 was also the first year Buffalo Funds, a Kansas City-based investment management firm, was the title corporate sponsor. In 2008 Buffalo Funds extended its contract with the NAIA tournament until the 2010 tournament; in 2013, it would be extended to 2017."

        "title": "Bavarian ice hockey leagues",
        "text": "The Bavarian ice hockey leagues are part of the German ice hockey league system and form the tiers four to six of the league system in the state of Bavaria. The leagues are operated by the \"Bayrischer Eissport Verband\", the Bavarian association for ice sports.\nOverview.\nThe league system in Bavaria consists of three separate tiers, these being the \"Bayernliga\" (IV) (English:\"Bavarian League\"), \"Landesliga\" (V) (English:\"State League\") and \"Bezirksliga\" (VI) (English:\"County League\"). The overall system has remained unchanged for a lengthy period of seasons.\nThe number of clubs, especially in the lowest tier, the \"Bezirksliga\", can fluctuate due to teams joining and other teams leaving the league. This is mostly due to lack of players, or, the other extreme, an over supply of players and the need to form a reserves team. Occasionally, clubs fold, reform or re-enter the league system. In the current \"Bayernliga\" season, the \"EC 2000 Ulm/Neu-Ulm\" folded in December 2007, being unable to pay their players.\nThe \"Bayernliga\" champion earns the right to gain promotion to the \"Oberliga\". At the end of the 2006-07 season, the runner-up was also promoted, which is an exception.\nUntil the end of the 1999-2000 season, the \"Bayernliga\" was only the fifth tier of the league system. The league between \"Oberliga\" and \"Bayernliga\", the \"Regionalliga\", was disbanded after this season and the majority of its clubs integrated into the \"Oberliga\".\nThe \"Bavarian Eissport Verband\" (BEV) is the largest regional ice hockey association in Germany with 14.000 registered players in over 90 clubs. Apart from the 79 senior teams playing in its league system for the 2007-08 season, there is also eight women's teams and 284 junior teams. For this reason, the \"Bayernliga\" is the only statewide league whose champion directly qualifies for the \"Oberliga\", all other leagues, the \"Regionalligas\" (English:\"Regional Leagues\") cover larger areas or have to go through a promotion play-off round.\nAbove the \"BEV\" there are currently five Bavarian teams in the \"DEL\" (\"German Ice Hockey League\") (I), two in the \"2nd Bundesliga\" (II) and twelve in the \"Oberliga\" (III). This means, 19 of 56 clubs in the first three divisions of German ice hockey currently come from Bavaria.\nIce hockey in Bavaria.\nBavaria, especially the southern, mountainous region of it, is the \"cradle\" of German ice hockey with many former German internationals coming from there. Historically, the German championship was dominated by clubs from Bavaria and Berlin. Nowadays however, Bavarian teams rarely win a championship. The situation is actually very similar to the Canadian teams in the NHL, who provide the majority of players but win a minority of titles.\nIn 87 editions of the German championship until 2007, Bavarian clubs have won 35. Of the current \"DEL\" teams, none hold a German title to their name. In the \"2nd Bundesliga\", \"Landshut\" and \"Riessersee\" hold 12 titles between them and in the \"Oberliga\", \"Füssen\", \"Tölz\" and \"Rosenheim\" have earned 20 German championship between them. The \"EV Füssen\" is second only in numbers of titles to \"Berliner Schlittschuhclub\", having won 16 German championships from 1949 to 1973.\nOne reason for the leading role Bavarian ice hockey had, and still to some extent has, is the number of ice hockey stadiums in the state. Almost 40 percent of all stadiums in Germany are in Bavaria and twice as many as in the second-ranked state Nordrhein-Westfalen:\nLeagues &amp; modus.\nThe nine senior leagues split over three tiers, operating on the following modus:\nBayernliga.\nFor the 2007-08 season, the \"Bayernliga\" sponsored the Bayer company operated in one single division of 16 clubs. The season went from October 2007 to March 2008.\nEach team in the league played each other twice, home and away. at the end of the regular season, the top eight teams entered a play-off round. In a best-of-three modus, the winner of the \"Bayernliga\" was determined. The bottom eight teams also played a best-of-three play-down round to determine the two teams relegated to the \"Landesligas\".\nUntil the end of the 1999-2000 season, the league operated on a fourteen club home-and-away season with no play-offs. From 2000, the strength of the league was increased to sixteen clubs in two regional groups of eight. After a first round, the top four of each group played another group stage, the championship group. The bottom four from each group did the same in a relegation group. From the 2002-03 season, play-offs were introduced after the championship round. The year after, the league moved to its current modus of a sixteen team home-and-away season with play-offs at the end.\nLandesliga.\nEach of the four \"Landesligas\" played a regular season of home-and-away matches. The two first placed teams of each league then entered a \"championship\" round of eight teams. Again played in home-and-away modus, the top two teams of this round gain promotion to the \"Bayernliga\". Should one or more teams from the \"Bayernliga\" gain entry to the \"Oberliga\" with a lesser number then that being relegated from the \"Oberliga\" to the \"Bayernliga\", additional teams may be promoted from the \"Landesliga\".\nThe other six teams in each of the four \"Landesligas\" played out another home-and-away round with the last placed team from each league being relegated to the corresponding \"Bezirksliga\".\nThis modus for the 2007-08 season actually differs from the previous years, when after the first round of home-and-away games, the \"Landesligas\" were split into a top-four and a bottom-four group, with the latter determining the relegated team and the former playing for the group champion who would enter a four-team play-off for the \"Landesliga\" title and \"Bayernliga\" promotion.\nBezirksliga.\nIn the \"Bezirksliga\", the lowest level of play, each league again plays a home-and-away season. The winner of each \"'Bezirksliga\" goes to the \"Bezirksliga championship\" where the four teams determined the champion of this level. Each of the four regional champions is also promoted to the corresponding \"Landesliga\". For all other clubs in the \"Bezirksliga\" the season ends after the main round. there is no relegation as there is no league below the \"Bezirksliga\".\nBayernliga, Landesliga and Bezirksliga champions.\nOn top of the division champions, each tier also plays out its level champions, the \"Bayernliga Meister\", \"Landesliga Meister\" and \"Bezirksliga Meister\".\nDivisionial champions.\nThe \"Landsliga\" and \"Bezirksliga\" are subdivided in four divisions each with the following divisional champions:\nBavarian clubs in the German league system.\nFor the 2016-17 season, the following clubs from Bavaria played in the top three German leagues:\nIn the DEL:\nIn the 2nd Bundesliga:\nIn the Oberliga:"

        "text": "The Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournament has been played every year since the formation of the Sun Belt Conference prior to the 1976–77 American collegiate academic year. The winner of the tournament is guaranteed an automatic berth into the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nHistory.\nFormat.\nThe size and format of the Sun Belt tournament has varied widely since its establishment in 1976. The size of the conference has ranged between a minimum of six teams and as many as thirteen.\nNonetheless, the tournament has consistently utilized a simple single-elimination style tournament. Through the 2018 edition of the tournament, with a few exceptions, all conference members were typically invited to each tournament. Depending on the total number of teams in the league during a particular year, higher-seeded teams have sometimes received byes into the quarterfinal or semifinal rounds. Teams have always been seeded based on regular season conference records, although some modifications were made when the league was split into divisions during the 2000s.\nDuring the 2018 offseason, the conference announced radical changes to its basketball scheduling and tournament format. A year later, many of these changes were reevaluated and placed on hold; the ones listed here remained in place.\nOn March 3, 2020, the conference announced that it had reached an agreement for Pensacola, Florida to host the men's and women's tournaments from 2021 to 2025. During that time, the tournament will completely abandon the use of campus sites and return to a format that features all conference members. First- and second-round games will be played simultaneously at Hartsell Arena on the campus of Pensacola State College and the Pensacola Bay Center, with semifinals and finals at the Bay Center.\nHosts.\nWith some exceptions, the tournament has historically been played at the home gym of one of the conference's members (e.g. Louisiana's Cajundome, North Texas' UNT Coliseum) or at a major arena in a nearby city (e.g. Mobile Civic Center near South Alabama).\nSome of the more common host venues have included the Charlotte Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina (Charlotte), the venue now known as Legacy Arena in Birmingham, Alabama (UAB), Barton Coliseum in Little Rock, Arkansas (Little Rock), and E.A. Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, Kentucky (Western Kentucky).\nHowever, the tournament has been hosted at a neutral arena site each year since 2009 (Hot Springs, Arkansas, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Pensacola, Florida). Lakefront Arena in New Orleans had previously hosted the event in 2002 when UNO was still a Sun Belt member, but the Privateers have since departed the conference. The only other neutral sites to host a Sun Belt tournament were the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia (1985) and the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi (1992–1993).\nNCAA performances.\nThe Sun Belt has a storied basketball history, sending multiple teams into the NCAA tournament in the 1980s and 1990s (most recently 1994), and then again in 2008 when both regular season champion South Alabama, and tournament winner Western Kentucky received bids, and in 2013 with Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee.\nCharlotte, then known athletically as UNC Charlotte, reached the Final Four in 1977, and future Sun Belt member Western Kentucky reached the Final Four in 1971. Overall, past and present Sun Belt schools have posted 21 wins in the NCAA Tournament during the time they were conference members.\nPerformance by school.\nTeams currently in Sun Belt with no championships: Coastal Carolina, Georgia Southern, Louisiana-Monroe, Marshall, Old Dominion, Southern Miss, Texas State\nSee also.\nSun Belt Conference women's basketball tournament"

The six teams with the best conference records in each division were invited to participate for a total of 12 teams. Teams were seeded by division. Connecticut and Pittsburgh had the best regular season conference records and received the East #1 seed and West #1 seed, respectively.\nConnecticut defeated Pittsburgh in the championship game 74–65 in double overtime to win its fifth Big East tournament championship.\nBracket.\nNote: By finishing in last place during the regular season in their respective divisions, Virginia Tech and West Virginia did not qualify for the tournament.\nChampionship game.\nCaron Butler, the tournament MVP, gave Connecticut the lead for good at 66–64 on a turnaround jumper with 1:59 left in the second overtime, and Pittsburgh fell to the Huskies in two overtimes, 74–65. After Ben Gordon was tied up with two seconds left on the shot clock, Taliek Brown put up a desperation heave from about thirty feet away with the shot clock running down to put the Huskies up 69–64, and they never looked back.\nBrandin Knight had a chance to win it for Pittsburgh at the end of the first overtime. After slipping and injuring his right knee, just as they tied the game at 52, Knight was clearly in pain. However, with 1.7 seconds left in OT, he checked into the game and put up a 40-foot 3-point attempt that would have won the game. It bounced off the rim and the game went to double OT.\nKnight's eight assists tied him at 229 for the school record in a season. He had fifteen points in the loss. Ontario Lett, who tied the game with 23 seconds left in overtime, had 17 in the loss.\nButler finished with 23 points for Uconn in the win, while Brown added 13. It was the fifth Big East tournament championship for the Huskies, their last coming in 1999, when they went on to win the national championship. It was their sixth title game appearance in the last eight years. The game was the second-longest title game in league history.

        "text": "Martin Phillips (born 30 April 1960) is a Welsh former professional darts player who competed in the British Darts Organisation (BDO). He won the 2014 World Masters championship.\nDarts career.\n1988–1994.\nPhillips was born in Dolgellau, and made his first televised darts appearance at the 1988 British Professional Championship reaching the last 16. In 1991, he appeared at his first World Championship losing in the first round to the defending champion Phil Taylor. In 1992 he defeated the Dutchman Bert Vlaardingerbroek 3–0 in the first round and knocked out five-time world champion Eric Bristow 3–2 in the second round to reach the quarter-final where he was defeated again by Taylor, who went on to clinch his second World title. He also played in 1993 and 1994, reaching the second round in both tournaments, losing both times to Bobby George. Phillips remained in the British Darts Organisation's events during the split in darts between 1993 and 1994 – but the first year after the split proved to be his last appearance at the Lakeside World Championship for nine years.\n1994–2006.\nAlthough he failed to qualify for the World Championships for several years, he picked up two WDF Europe Cup pairs titles, in 1994 with Eric Burden and 1998 with Sean Palfrey – plus a WDF World Cup pairs title also with Palfrey in 1997. He had limited singles success for over a decade, with only three semi-final appearances at the Isle of Man Open (1996, 1997 and 2000)\nHe returned for the 2003 BDO World Darts Championship, but lost in the first round to John Walton and would then miss out on qualification for the event for the next three years, leaving him with just the one appearance at the Lakeside in 13 years.\n2007–2011.\nIn 2007, Phillips returned to the Lakeside but lost again in the first round, this time to Scotland's Paul Hanvidge. His form began to improve during 2007 with a tournament win at the Turunç Open in Turkey, and semi-final appearances at the Welsh Classic and Northern Ireland Open. Towards the end of 2007 he was on the receiving end of a defeat and a nine-dart finish by John Walton in their last 16 match at the 2007 Winmau World Masters.\nAt the 2008 BDO World Championship, Phillips beat Shaun Greatbatch in the last 32 but lost in the second round to reigning champion Martin Adams. Another first round exit followed in the 2009 BDO World Championship, losing 3–1 to Ross Montgomery, but he picked up the 2009 Border Classic title and reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Open and Welsh Classic.\nIn the 2010 BDO World Championship, Phillips went on to reach the semi-finals for the first time in his career beating seventh seed Dave Prins 3–0 in the first round, qualifier Paul Carter 4–2 in the second round and second seed Scott Waites in the quarter-finals. Phillips had gone into a 4–0 lead before Waites brought the scores level at 4–4, before Phillips showed better consistency in the final set to reach the last four where he was beaten 6–4 by Martin Adams.\nIn October 2010 he won the biggest title of his career so far by winning the WDF Europe Cup beating 2010 World Champion Martin Adams on the way to the final where he beat Willy van de Wiel 7–3. Two weeks later, he won seven matches to reach the semi-finals of the Winmau World Masters for the first time before losing to Stuart Kellett. In November 2010, Phillips made his first appearance at the Grand Slam of Darts having qualified through his runs to the semi-finals at the Lakeside. In the group stages, he beat Adrian Lewis (who went on to become PDC World Champion just two months later) 5–2 in legs. Phillips did not qualify from the group stages after losing 1–5 to Scott Waites and 4–5 to Co Stompé.\nHe made the semi-finals for the second year running at the 2011 BDO World Championship, beating Mark Barilli 3–0, Joey ten Berge 4–3 and Gary Robson 5–4, then lost a repeat of the previous year's semi-final match with Martin Adams 4–6.\nHe has appeared at 2011 Grand Slam of darts and he has had a better year then in 2010. He qualified from his group despite losing to Adrian Lewis 5–4 he claimed victories over Dutchman Co Stompé and Vincent van der Voort both 5–2, To set up a last 16 clash with fellow countryman and former World Champion Mark Webster who he lost 10–8 having led 3–0 and 8–5.\n2014: Masters Champion.\nAfter losing as an unseeded player to Wesley Harms in the first round of the World Championship in 2012, Phillips failed to qualify for Lakeside in either 2013 or 2014. However, he bounced back spectacularly by regaining his place in the world's top 8, before winning the first major TV title in his 26-year career at the Winmau World Masters. After reaching the semi-finals without dropping a set, Phillips survived a match dart in a deciding leg victory over Glen Durrant before beating Jamie Hughes 7–3 in the final. Phillips would become the BDO world number one in November that year. However, seeded fifth at the 2015 BDO World Championship, Phillips was defeated 3–0 by Madars Razma in the first round. At the 2015 Winmau World Masters, Phillips' title defence was ended at the quarter-final stage by Glen Durrant, who avenged his semi final loss to Phillips from the previous year.\n2019.\nAs of 16 November 2019, Phillips has not participated in any darts tournament."

        "title": "Rowing cycle",
        "text": "A rowing cycle is a wheeled vehicle propelled by a rowing motion of the body. Steering, braking, and shifting are usually done by the handlebars. Feet are on symmetrical foot rests, as opposed to rotating pedals. Unlike many rowing boats, the rider faces forward. Rowing cycles exist in numerous designs, particularly with respect to frames and drive mechanisms. Commercial production numbers for rowing cycles are small compared to that of standard bicycles. \nHistory.\nThe use of a rowing-like action to propel a land vehicle goes probably to the 1870s, as George W. Lee used a sliding-seat in a tricycle. Roadsculler races were held in Madison Square Garden in the 1880s. A toy catalog from FAO Schwarz in 1911 advertised a four-wheeled \"Row-Cycle\" for children, operated using two levers in a standing position and with steering done by the feet. In the 1920s, Manfred Curry in Germany designed and constructed the Landskiff (\"land boat\"), a four-wheeled vehicle that would be known as a Rowmobile in the English speaking countries. A newsreel from 1937 shows a rowed bicycle that is very similar to today's Craftsbury SS rowing bicycle, Rowbike and VogaBike.\nPropulsion and steering.\nSome rowed vehicles use a stroke similar to a boat, in that force is used only when straightening the body, the drive portion of the stroke, not the recovery. Other rowed vehicles, mostly those that use linkages and crankshafts in their drive trains, use force in both straightening and bending the body. On most, the handlebars move; most also have moving footrests and some have a moving seat.\nThe handle bars on some rowed vehicles travel on a semicircular path due to the handlebars being mounted to a fixed length lever pinned to the frame. Some attempt to simulate the more level stroke used in rowing a boat, for example Streetrower and Vogabike. The September 2007 issue of Velovision magazine claimed that Streetrower has \"the most natural rowing action of any rowing vehicle to date\".\nThe Streetrower uses a steering system actuated by servos and controlled by the rider with a joy stick.\nDrive train.\nRowed vehicles generally have one of three drive trains: chain, linkages, or cable.\nThe Rowbike brand uses a standard bicycle chain, rear gears, and derailleur. The chain does not travel in a loop, as is the case with a standard bicycle. It moves back and forth over the rear cog in a reciprocating motion. The chain is connected at one end to the frame of the rowbike and to a bungee cord on the other. As the rower pulls back the chain engages the rear cog and the bungee cord is extended, and when the rower returns forward the bungee cord contracts, pulling the chain back and ensuring there is no slack in the chain. All Rowbikes have a rear derailleur, even single speeds, due to the need to keep proper tension in the chain.\nRowbikes that use linkages include Champiot and Powerpumper. They use linkages connected to a crank shaft, similar to a pedal car.\nThe Thys Rowingbike and Streetrower use a cable which coils and uncoils about a spiral-shaped spool. Thys calls his version a snek drive (after the Dutch term for Fusee (horology)).\nTandem, three and four wheeled variants.\nBalancing on a two-wheeled rowed vehicle while rowing requires some practice, even for a skilled bicyclist. Tricycle and quadracycle forms are usually heavier but do not share this problem. The Streetrower is a tricycle with two wheels at the front and one at the rear; the Vogatrike also has three wheels. An early quadracycle, the 'Irish Mail', was similar to railroad handcars used by railroad workers to inspect tracks. The four-wheeled Champiot is reminiscent of the 'Irish Mail' type machine in that it uses linkages, not a chain, in its drive train.\nThys has produced a tandem rowingbike."

        "text": "In Gridiron football, a completion or completed pass occurs when an eligible receiver (usually a wide receiver, tight end or running back) successfully catches a forward pass thrown by the quarterback without the ball touching the ground. It is one of the three possible outcomes of any pass thrown during a passing play, with the other two being incompletion and interception.\nStatistically, a completed pass is recorded down as a completion for the quarterback, and as a reception for the player catching the ball. The recorded yardage gained is the total yardage gained when the play ends, and may be subdivided into Air Yards (the distance from the line of scrimmage to the spot where the ball was caught) and Yards After Catch (the distance from where the ball was caught to where the play ends on the field or out of bounds)."

The event was increased to 16 players and extended from 6 to 8 days. Although there were 16 players, they were not the top 16 ranked players that would compete in the following years. BBC Television coverage did not start until 26 January and so only two of the eight first round matches were televised.\nCliff Thorburn of Canada became the first overseas player to win the competition beating Ray Reardon in the final to win the first of his three titles. The first round match between Bill Werbeniuk and Alex Higgins saw the biggest crowd ever recorded at a snooker match in the UK 2,836 attended the match at the Conference Centre. The highest break of the tournament was 128 made by Terry Griffiths.\nField.\nFor the first time there were 16 players in the event. Alex Higgins, the World Champion was the number 1 seed with Steve Davis, the defending champion seeded 2. Places were allocated to the leading 8 players in the world rankings and there were two sponsors wild-card entries, Jimmy White (ranked 10) and Terry Griffiths (ranked 14). The remaining six players qualified based on their performance in the Professional Players Tournament in October. They were semi-finalist John Virgo, quarter-finalists Joe Johnson, Dean Reynolds and Bill Werbeniuk, and Mark Wildman and Tony Meo who lost in the last 16.

        "text": "The 2000–01 Euroleague was the inaugural basketball season of the EuroLeague, under ULEB and its newly formed Euroleague Basketball Company authority. Overall it was the 44th season of the premier competition for European men's professional basketball clubs overall. Initially not recognised or sanctioned by FIBA and considered a breakaway competition. It started on October 16, 2000, with a regular season game between hosts Real Madrid Teka and Olympiacos, which was held at the Raimundo Saporta Pavilion, in Madrid, Spain, and it ended with the last championship finals game on May 10, 2001, which was held at the PalaMalaguti arena, in Bologna, Italy.\nThis season did not feature all of the top-tier level European club basketball teams, as some of them opted to compete in the 2000–01 FIBA SuproLeague competition instead, after the row erupted between the previous EuroLeague governing body, FIBA, and the newly established Euroleague Basketball Company. It was the first time in European basketball that several clubs did not qualify to a European competition based on performance, but instead wild cards were given. Top clubs also signed licences with the right to participate in upcoming seasons regardless of their domestic league ranking. \nA total of 24 teams competed for the EuroLeague title, which was in the end won by Kinder Bologna. Dejan Tomašević was the EuroLeague Regular season MVP, and Manu Ginóbili was the EuroLeague Finals MVP.\nEuropean Champions' Cup teams divided.\nThe FIBA European Champions' Cup was originally established by FIBA and it operated under its umbrella from 1958 until the summer of 2000, concluding with the 1999–2000 season. Euroleague Basketball Company was created by ULEB clubs in 2000. At the time the leagues of ULEB were Spain, Italy, Greece, Belgium, Portugal, England and Switzerland. However against the will of their domestic leagues clubs from Lithuania, Croatia, Russia, Israel and Slovenia opted for the Euroleague competition despite the fact their leagues were not members of ULEB. \nFIBA had never trademarked the \"EuroLeague\" name and had no legal recourse on the usage of that name, so they had to find a new name for their league. The following 2000–01 season started with two top European professional club basketball competitions: FIBA SuproLeague (renamed from the FIBA EuroLeague) and Euroleague.\nTop clubs were split between the two leagues: Panathinaikos, Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv, CSKA Moscow, and Efes Pilsen stayed with FIBA, while Olympiacos, Kinder Bologna, Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Tau Cerámica, and Benetton Treviso joined Euroleague Basketball. Lugano Tigers the Swiss champions were the last team to join the ULEB side and enter the competition.\nRules, format changes and dates.\nOn 11 July 2000 in Thessaloniki during the ULEB Assembly format changes and dates were set for the new competition\n The Official List of the teams will include a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 16 players. Ten players will be allowed on the bench while 2 USA players per team were permitted. There was no Final Four but a best of three series in the Final. \nAndrea Bassani (ex-General Manager of the Italian League) was appointed in the Assembly as the Manager of Marketing and Media of the Euroleague.\nReferees.\nKostas Rigas was elected the commissioner. Three referees will officiate every Euroleague game. The team of Officials will be made up of 45 referees which signed guaranteed contracts for three years with no age restriction. However FIBA did not allow them to officiate in their domestic leagues in 2000-01.\nDates.\nGames will be played on Thursdays, with the possibility of moving them forward to Wednesday when necessary.\nTeam allocation.\nA total of 24 teams from 14 countries participate in the competition.\nDistribution.\nThe table below shows the default access list.\nThe competition culminated in a best 3 out of 5 playoff series.\nTeams.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round\nRegular season.\nThe first phase was a regular season, in which the competing teams were drawn into four groups, each containing six teams. Each team played every other team in its group at home and away, resulting in 10 games for each team in the first stage. The top 4 teams in each group advanced to the next round, The Top 16. The complete list of tiebreakers is provided in the lead-in to the Regular Season results.\nIf one or more clubs were level on won-lost record, tiebreakers were applied in the following order:\nGroup A.\nSource: Euroleague\nGroup B.\nSource: Euroleague\nGroup C.\nSource: Euroleague\nGroup D.\nSource: Euroleague\nPlayoffs.\nBracket.\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding, the numbers to the right indicate the result of games including result in bold of the team that won in that game, and the numbers furthest to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nFirst Round.\nIn a best-of-three series the remaining 16 teams were placed against each other. The games were held between the 31st of January and the 14th of February, 2001, with the top 8 teams advancing to the Playoffs.\nQuarterfinals.\nIn a best-of-three series the remaining eight teams were placed against each other. The games were held between 21 February and 7 March 2001, with the top 4 teams advancing to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nIn a best-of-five series the remaining four teams were placed against each other. The games were held between the 27th of March and the 7th of April, 2001.\nFinals.\nThe culminating stage of the Euroleague season, the two remaining teams that won the semifinal series played each other in a best-of-five series.\nAftermath.\nIn May 2001, Europe had two continental champions, Maccabi Tel Aviv of the FIBA SuproLeague and Kinder Bologna of Euroleague Basketball Company's EuroLeague. The leaders of both organizations realized the need to come up with a new single competition. Negotiating from the position of strength ULEB dictated proceedings, and FIBA essentially had no choice but to agree to their terms. As a result, the EuroLeague was fully integrated under Euroleague Basketball Company's umbrella, and teams that competed in the FIBA SuproLeague during the 2000–01 season joined it as well. It is today officially admitted that European basketball had two champions that year, Maccabi of the FIBA SuproLeague and Kinder Bologna of the Euroleague Basketball Company's EuroLeague.\nA year later, Euroleague Basketball Company and FIBA decided that Euroleague Basketball's EuroLeague competition would be the main basketball tournament on the continent, to be played between the top level teams of Europe. FIBA Europe would also organize a European league for third-tier level teams, known as the FIBA Europe League competition, while Euroleague Basketball would also organize its own second-tier level league, combining FIBA's long-time Korać Cup and Saporta Cup competitions into one new competition, the EuroCup. In 2005, Euroleague Basketball and FIBA decided to cooperate with each other, and did so jointly until 2016.\nIn essence, the authority in European professional basketball was divided over club-country lines. FIBA stayed in charge of national team competitions (like the FIBA EuroBasket, the FIBA World Cup, and the Summer Olympics), while Euroleague Basketball took over the European professional club competitions. From that point on, FIBA's Korać Cup and Saporta Cup competitions lasted only one more season before folding and merged to the FIBA Europe Champions Cup in 2002 which was when Euroleague Basketball launched the ULEB Cup."

He earned all-state, All-Southern Conference and Helms All-American status while playing for the Tribe. On February 14 of his senior year, Chambers set an NCAA single game rebound record of 51 against the University of Virginia. It is a record that still stands to this day. He was also selected as Virginia's Outstanding Collegiate Basketball Player that same year.\nChambers ended his William &amp; Mary career with 1,456 points.

        "text": "Sailing into the wind is a sailing expression that refers to a sail boat's ability to move forward despite being headed into (or very nearly into) the wind. A sailboat cannot make headway by sailing directly into the wind (\"see\" \"Discussion,\" below); the point of sail into the wind is called \"close hauled\". \nSailing into the wind is possible when the sail is angled in a slightly more forward direction than the sail force. In this aspect, the boat will move forward because the keel (centerline), of the boat acts to the water as the sail acts to the wind. The force of the sail is balanced by the force of the keel. This keeps the boat from moving in the direction of the sail force. Although total sail force is to the side when sailing into the wind, a proper angle of attack moves the boat forward.\nAnother way of stating this is as follows:\nIn practice, optimal sailing in the direction from which the wind is coming will usually be at a course of around forty five degree angles to the oncoming wind. To reach a particular point, alternating the direction of the wind between the port and starboard side is usually necessary. This is called \"tacking.\" \nDiscussion.\nThe points of sail clarify the realities of sailing into the wind. One of the points of sail is \"Head to Wind.\" A boat turns through this point on each tack. It is the point at which the boat is neither on port tack or starboard tack and is headed directly into the wind. However, a boat cannot sail directly into the wind, thus if it comes head to the wind it loses steerage and is said to be \"in irons.\" Thus boats sailing into the wind are actually sailing \"Close Hauled\" (i.e., with sails tightly trimmed).\nWhen one sails closer to the wind than is optimal (i.e., with a too small angle to the wind), it is called \"pinching.\" This phrase is also a colloquial expression meaning \"to be reckless.\""

The first annual National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) basketball tournament featured eight teams playing in a single-elimination format. In 1938, it would expand to its current size of 32 teams.\nThis tournament is unique because it was started two years prior to the NCAA men's tournament and one year before the National Invitation Tournament, and all the teams play over a series of six days instead of several weekends. The compactness of the tournament has given it the nickname \"college basketball's toughest tournament\".\nIt began when Dr. James Naismith, Emil S. Liston, Frank Cramer, and local leaders formed the National College Basketball Tournament, which was staged at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. The goal of the tournament was to establish a forum for small colleges and universities to determine a national basketball champion.\nThe first championship game featured Central Missouri State University defeating Morningside College (Iowa) 35–24. It is also the lowest scoring championship game in tournament history.\nAwards and honors.\nMany of the records set by the 1937 tournament have been broken, and many of the awards were established much later:\nBracket.\nThe third place game featured the losing teams from the national semifinals to determine 3rd and 4th places in the tournament. This game was played until 1988."

        "text": "The 1911 Giro d'Italia was the third edition of the Giro d'Italia, a Grand Tour set up and sponsored by the newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". The race began on 18 May in Rome with a stage that stretched to Florence. It was composed of twelve stages that covered a total distance of . The race came to a close back in Rome on 6 June after a stage. The race was won by the Italian rider Carlo Galetti of the Bianchi team. Second and third respectively were the Italian riders Giovanni Rossignoli and Giovanni Gerbi.\nReturning champion Carlo Galetti won the race's opening stage into Florence and was the first to lead the race. He lost the lead to Giovanni Rossignoli after Galetti finished poorly on the race's second stage. Rossignoli held the lead for four days after Galetti took back the lead after the sixth stage. Frenchman Lucien Petit-Breton became the first non-Italian to lead the Giro d'Italia after the race's ninth stage. Petit-Breton lost the lead the next day to Galetti, who then held it all the way to the race's conclusion in Rome.\nChanges from the 1910 Giro d'Italia.\nIn both 1909 and 1910 Milan had served as both the start and finish of the Giro d'Italia. The organizers chose to honor the 50th anniversary of the unification of Italy by holding the start and finish of the Giro in the Italian capital of Rome.\nThe organizers chose to expand the Giro d'Italia from ten to twelve stages after its great success. The race also saw an increase of close to 500 kilometers in length. The organizers also included the first climb above 2000 meters in the race, the Sestriere. This was also the first edition of the Giro to go deep down into the southern part of Italy, specifically the Bari.\nParticipants.\nOf the 86 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 15 May, 24 of them made it to the finish in Rome on 6 June. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team. There were five teams that competed in the race: Atala-Dunlop, Bianchi-Pirelli, Fiat-Pirelli, Legnano-Dunlop, and Senior-Polack.\nThe peloton was composed of primarily Italians. The field featured two former Giro d'Italia champions in the 1909 winner Luigi Ganna and returning champion Carlo Galetti. Other notable Italian riders included Giovanni Rossignoli, Eberardo Pavesi, and Giovanni Gerbi. Two-time Tour de France winner Lucien Petit-Breton also competed in the race.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage began on 15 May and stretched from Rome to Florence. The racing that day was marred by heavy rain, which led to ten withdrawals. Carlo Galetti won the stage ahead of Giovanni Rossignoli and Dario Beni. The next leg was also dogged by rain and very poor conditions on the road and saw the climbing of the Colle de Bacco. Giovanni Gerbi was the first rider to summit the Colle de Bacco. The climb wore Gerbi out and he was caught and passed by three riders and ultimately finished fourth on the stage. Vincenzo Borgarello was the first rider to cross the finish line in Genoa and won the stage, where a large crowd waited for the riders to finish. Rossignoli took the race lead after finishing two positions in front of Galetti. The race's third day of racing was the first to have clear weather. Race leader Rossignoli bested the likes of Giovanni Gerbi and Carlo Durando to win the stage and consolidate his lead in the general classification. The next stage was hotly contested, with the peloton staying together for the whole stage as Carlo Galetti took the stage win.\nThe race's fifth stage is considered to be the first real mountain stage in Giro d'Italia history. The stage contained the climb of the Sestriere which rises over 2,000 meters. As the race entered the Val Chisone leading up the Sestriere, the peloton ran into muddy roads, which forced many to walk their bikes. Frenchman Lucien Petit-Breton led the riders up the slopes before cracking near the snowy summit. He was passed first by Ezio Corlaita, who was the first to summit the Sestriere, and then by many other riders. Petit-Breton caught up with the leading riders on the long descent and rode into the finish in Turin with Corlaita, Rossignoli, and Galetti. Petit-Breton edged out Galetti for the stage win as Galetti tied Rossignoli for the overall lead.\nThe riders started the sixth stage in Turin with a large number of people in attendance for the sendoff. Giuseppe Santhià took the stage as the riders rolled over the packed finish line in Milan. Dario Beni soloed to victory in the seventh leg, finishing over a minute ahead of the second-place finisher Santhià. The next stage was won by Lauro Bordin as Galetti extended his overall lead by a single point over Rossignoli. Ezio Corlaita won the Giro's ninth stage, while Lucien Petit-Breton took the race lead and doing so, became the first non-Italian to lead the Giro d'Italia. In the following stage, the leading breakaway contained six riders – race leader Petit-Breton and five Bianchi riders – and rode into the finish in Bari together. Carlo Galetti took the stage win and the race lead, while Petit-Breton finished in sixth place on the day and was pushed down to second overall.\nThe race's penultimate day of racing was scheduled to go from Bari to Naples. During the stage, Lucien Petit-Breton crashed and was forced to abandon the race. The route had the riders go through rough roads that were heavy with dust and occasional passed over streams, thus flooding the roads. The riders were also chase by enraged buffalo. All of those factors caused the riders to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples, in Pompeii with Alfredo Sivocci winning the day. The last stage ended back in Rome, where the race began. Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day. Bianchi's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d'Italia.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were 24 cyclists who had completed all twelve stages. For these cyclists, the points they received from each of their stage placing's were added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the fewest accumulated points was the winner. Giovanni Gerbi won the prize for best ranked isolati rider in the general classification."

There were 25 competitors from 16 nations, with each nation having up to three swimmers. The event was won by Sándor Wladár of Hungary, with his countryman Zoltán Verrasztó taking second. Mark Kerry of Australia earned bronze. They were the first medals in the event for both nations. The United States' four-Games podium streak (over which the nation earned 10 of 12 possible medals) ended due to the American-led boycott.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nFive of the 8 finalists from the 1976 Games (all but the medalists) returned: fourth-place finisher Mark Tonelli and fifth-place finisher Mark Kerry of Australia, sixth-place finisher Miloslav Roľko of Czechoslovakia, and seventh-place finisher Róbert Rudolf and eighth-place finisher Zoltán Verrasztó of Hungary. The medals in 1976 had been swept by American swimmers; the United States boycotted the 1980 Games. Verrasztó had earned medals at each of the three World Championships held so far (silver in 1973, gold in 1975, and bronze in 1978), and was favored with no American swimmers in the pool.\nIreland, Romania, and Vietnam each made their debut in the event. The Netherlands made its sixth appearance, the only nation to have competed at each appearance of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats and final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 4 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows."

The event was won by Jörg Woithe of East Germany, the nation's first medal in the men's 100 metre freestyle. Sweden earned its first medals in the event since 1952 with Per Holmertz's silver and Per Johansson's bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nNone of the eight finalists from the 1976 Games returned. The top sprinters of the time were absent, Rowdy Gaines due to the American-led boycott and Jonty Skinner due to the ban on apartheid South Africa.\nAlgeria, Angola, Cyprus, Libya, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe each made their debut in the event. Great Britain and Hungary each made their 16th appearance, most of the nations competing in 1980, but behind the absent United States' 17 appearances.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format.

The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke.

        "text": "The 2009 Six Nations Championship, known as the RBS 6 Nations for sponsorship reasons, was the 10th Six Nations Championship, and the 115th international championship, an annual rugby union competition contested by the six major European national teams: England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The tournament was held between 7 February and 21 March 2009.\nIreland won the Grand Slam and Triple Crown, only their second Grand Slam, and first since 1948, and first Triple Crown since 2007.\nEngland finished as runners-up, and also won the Calcutta Cup. The tournament featured the first Friday night game in its history, played between France and Wales at the Stade de France.\nSummary.\nThe tournament began on 7 February 2009, when England hosted Italy in the earlier of the day's two matches. Ireland played France later that evening, with Scotland versus Wales the following day.\nThe reigning champions on entering the 2009 tournament were Wales, who won the Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2008. The winners of both accolades in 2009 were Ireland, with Ronan O'Gara's dropped goal leaving the score in the final match against Wales in Cardiff on 21 March at 17–15. Wales's Stephen Jones then missed a late penalty from just inside the Ireland half to leave Wales in fourth position. Ireland's two tries in that match came when captain Brian O'Driscoll and Tommy Bowe scored in quick succession in the 44th and 46th minutes respectively. Paul O'Connell received the Triple Crown and Ireland's captain Brian O'Driscoll lifted the trophy. It was Ireland's first Grand Slam since 1948, 61 years earlier. This was achieved in the first Six Nations Championship since Declan Kidney was appointed as manager of the Ireland team, succeeding Eddie O'Sullivan who resigned after the previous tournament.\nTwelve tries were scored by Ireland throughout the tournament, and five wins left the team on top of the table at the end of the Championship with ten points. They opened with a 30–21 win over France at home stadium Croke Park on 7 February. On 15 February, Ireland's second match was a 38–9 victory over Italy at the Stadio Flaminio in Rome. On 28 February, Ireland beat England 14–13 at Croke Park and on 14 March, Ireland beat Scotland 22–15 at Murrayfield Stadium. Then followed the Grand Slam against Wales on 21 March 2009. That game was attended by the President of Ireland Mary McAleese, who presented the trophy, and Taoiseach Brian Cowen. Following the game there were tributes from politicians. A civic reception for the team took place outside Dublin's Mansion House on 22 March at 16:30, with 18,000 fans attending alongside Taoiseach Brian Cowen and Dublin's Deputy Lord Mayor Emer Costelloe. 2,000 fans had earlier greeted the team upon their arrival at Dublin Airport. Brian O'Driscoll described 21 March as a \"sweet, sweet day\". The game was watched by 945,000 people in Ireland, the highest rating television programme in the country by that stage of 2009. Former coach Eddie O'Sullivan was said to be \"delighted\" for the team. Brian O'Driscoll was named player of the tournament, beating Italy's Sergio Parisse and Ireland teammate Paul O'Connell. O'Connell was later named captain of the British and Irish Lions team to tour South Africa and containing fourteen members of the Grand Slam winning Irish team on 21 April 2009, describing it as \"a great honour\".\nItaly were the only side to not win a match in the tournament, suffering defeats by twenty points or more against, in addition to Ireland, France (50–8), England (36–11) and Scotland (26–6), while losing 20–15 to Wales. Scotland managed a solitary victory against Italy to finish on 2 points. England, France and Wales all managed to win three of their matches to finish level on six points but England's points difference of +54 granted them second place in the table. Their points tally was boosted by a 36–10 defeat of France and a 26–12 win against Scotland which sealed the Calcutta Cup. Wales' early loss to France and narrow loss to Ireland in the last game of the tournament denied them a second consecutive championship. Although Wales needed to beat Ireland by more than 13 points to win the championship, they could have won the game and the Triple Crown in the last minute of the tournament (as well as denying Ireland the Grand Slam) if Stephen Jones' 50-yard penalty kick had not fallen short.\nFixtures.\nThe fixtures for the 2009 Six Nations were released on 17 April 2008. The France v Wales game on 27 February was the first Friday night game in the history of the championship, both under the Five and Six Nations format.\nRound 3.\nNotes:\nRound 4.\nNotes:\nRound 5.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:"

The Masters is the first of four major championships to be played each year, with the final round of the Masters always being scheduled for the second Sunday in April. The Masters is the only one of the four majors to use the same course every year; the Augusta National Golf Club. Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the U.S. Open, the Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship) for the next five years, and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to the Players Championship for the five years following their victory. The champion also receives the \"Green Jacket\", the first one being won by Sam Snead in 1949. The champion takes the jacket home for a year and returns it thereafter. A multiple-time champion will only have one jacket unless his size changes dramatically.\nJack Nicklaus holds the record for the most Masters victories, winning the tournament six times during his career. Nicklaus is also the oldest winner of the Masters: he was 46 years 82 days old when he won in 1986. Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, and Tiger Woods co-hold the record for most consecutive victories with two. Woods was the youngest winner of the Masters, 21 years 104 days old when he won in 1997. Woods also set the record for the widest winning margin (12 strokes). The lowest winning score, with 268, 20-under-par, was scored by Dustin Johnson in 2020.\nThe highest winning score of 289 (+1) was originally set by Sam Snead in 1954, it was equalled by Jack Burke Jr. in 1956, and Zach Johnson in 2007. Five golfers have won the Masters wire-to-wire; Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Nicklaus in 1972, Raymond Floyd in 1976, and Jordan Spieth in 2015. Other players have led wire-to-wire if ties after a round are included, most recently Dustin Johnson in the 2020 Masters Tournament. Scottie Scheffler is the current champion. He won the 2024 Masters Tournament with a score of (−11).\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "The Czech Ice Hockey Association (), also known by the shortened name Czech Ice Hockey (), is the governing body of ice hockey and sledge hockey in Czechia. It is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and controls the majority of organized ice hockey in the Czech Republic. \nStructure.\nThe highest body of the Czech Ice Hockey Association is the conference, which convenes once every two years and is elected once every four years. \nBetween conferences, the ČSLH is managed by an eleven-member executive committee headed by the president of the association. As of 2023, Alois Hadamczik is president of the association and the vice presidents are Petr Bříza and Aleš Pavlík, who is also president of the Association of Professional Ice Hockey Clubs (). The remaining executive committee members are: \nThe Supervisory Board is a permanent body that also functions between the conferences. The seven-person board is chaired by Miloslav Šeba. \nČSLH membership is open to both clubs and individuals. \nThe Czech Ice Hockey Association has nearly 35,000 players registered with the IIHF, of which around 8,700 are in the men's category, almost 1,900 are in the women's category, and over 23,000 are in the junior category. There are 183 indoor rinks and thirteen outdoor rinks in the country.\nCommittees.\nWithin the ČSLH there are eighteen specialized committees or commissions:\nČSLH is also the founder of PRO-HOCKEY Cz, a subsidiary company that manages marketing and television rights related to Czech national ice hockey teams (including junior).\nNational leagues.\nFrom hockey competitions ČSLH organizes at central level I and II. Men's league, women's league and extraliga (leagues) for pupils, teenagers and juniors. On the regional level, regional assemblies of regional agendas (such as the Regional Hockey League) are organized by the regional unions.\nHistory.\nOrigin and time before the First World War.\nThe association was formed on the initiative of Slavia Praha functionary Emil Procházka, who sent the application to the just-emerging LIHG on November 15, 1908, although the constituent general assembly of the Czech Hockey League took place on December 11. The General Meetings were attended by delegates from twelve sports clubs. However, there were immediately disputes between representatives of Slavia Praha and Sparta Praha, and the General Meeting had to repeat it three times. The first chairman of the Union became Jaroslav Potůček from BZK Prague for more than a few days until January 13, 1909. The union subsequently decided to send a representative team, whose players were later named hockey musketeers, to an international tournament in Chamonix, France.\nThe union did not use money and the spread of ice hockey (called to differentiate itself from the Canadian hockey band) helped at least by the fact that its officials published articles in various magazines. Particularly active was the representative of the Czech Union in the LIHG and the goalkeeper of the ice hockey musketeers Josef Gruss and interesting ideas were presented in the press also the shooter of the first Czech goalkeeping goal, Jan Palouš. After the success of the 1911 European Ice Hockey Championship, the association managed to win the next championship. This was later canceled because the Austrian Hockey League was not a member of the LIHG at the time of its conduct, and the indiscriminate match of the Czech hockey players with the Germans did not repeat despite the protests of the rival. The then president of the Czech Union Procházka resigned in response to this decision.\nBefore the First World War, the Czech Union alternated about two dozen clubs, but they had to organize the tournaments themselves. The association has been more focused on safeguarding positions on the international scene. Unlike football, the Hockey League has succeeded in defending membership of the LIHG on the national principle instead of the state throughout this critical period.\nBetween the two world wars.\nAfter the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Hockey Association (CSSH) was established in 1919 as an organization under which, in addition to ice hockey, the bands and ground hockey also fell. Ice hockey was run by about a third of 25 member clubs. Following the success of the ice hockey team in the 1920 ice hockey tournament, the Ice Hockey Section, under the chairmanship of the successful representative of Jan Fleischmann in 1921, was named the Czechoslovak Canadian Hockey Association (CSSKH).\nIn the last month of 1923, the union split, when the Czechoslovak Association of Canadian Hockey (ČSAKH) separated from it under the leadership of Karel Hartmann of Sparta. The calm of the situation did not contribute to the fact that in January of the following year a union championship was held, which was the first time to fight for the trophy cup donated by the president T. Masaryk. The disputes also affected the nomination for the ice hockey tournament of the 1924 Winter Olympics, despite the fact that the Czechoslovak Sporting Village tried to prevent it. Of the clubs that leaned toward the ČSAKH, only Maleček, who received a soldier of the attendance service, attended an order from the Ministry of Defense. The unification of the Union took place after a year, mainly under the influence of the European Ice Hockey Championship 1925.\nDomestic championship decorated with gold medals has greatly helped the Union to promote ice hockey at the expense of the band in Slovakia, where it took place after some peripetials. In 1927, the union brought together twice the number of clubs to the state after the First World War, but this did not match the number of registered players. So registration was declared a necessary condition for each player to take part in a match. In the following year, ice and ground hockey structures were separated. At the same time, the problem of the parallel existence of the associations of national minorities on the territory of Czechoslovakia began to be solved. German clubs associated with Deutscher EisHockey Verband (DEHV) threatened international boycott from LIHG, but the situation has improved rapidly. In January 1929, for example, a match was played between the teams of Prague and Opava, where the best hockey players of German origin were in the Czechoslovak territory. At the 1929 European ice hockey championship, four Opava players went out with the Czechoslovak representation team, with another title largely deserving of key goals in two extensions in the decisive games Wolfgang Dorasil.\nAfter a successful championship, the union also had the final promise of building a winter stadium with the first artificial ice in Czechoslovakia. The construction of the stadium in Štvanice in Prague has faced a number of problems. These, among other things, made it impossible for the European Ice Hockey Championship 1932 to be held in Prague. In the fall of 1931, the Czechoslovak League of Canadian Hockey (ČSLKH) was established, which merged clubs from the Czechoslovak and German associations. Jaromir Citta was the chairman of the then Czechoslovak club, LTC Praha, for the last five years. His work has also begun by the Corps of Judges, who associated the judges as other important participants in each hockey match. On November 6, 1932, the official and permanent opening of the winter stadium in Štvanice took place. A quarter of a year later, the Ice Hockey World Championship took place in 1933, when Czechoslovak hockey players won another title of European Champion.\nWhile the number of hockey clubs distributed was around 15, the number of hockey clubs under ČSLKH and registered ice hockey players increased until 1938. At that time, Hungarian hockey clubs operating in the Czechoslovak territory were also involved in ČSLKH. Overall, ČSLKH held in 1938 with 361 member clubs a remarkable European primacy. This was due to the organization of the World Championships and the involvement of Canadian ice hockey players, especially by Prague clubs. Both of these facts could have led to the popularity of ice hockey popularity among the public. Among the Canadian players, Mike Buckna was instrumental to the development of ice hockey in Czechoslovakia and coached the national team to the bronze medal at the 1938 Ice Hockey World Championship, gold at the 1947 Ice Hockey World Championship, and silver in the ice hockey tournament at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. \nThe association has managed to establish and complete at least two years of the National Leagues as a new national ice hockey club competition under these favorable conditions. This was in the conditions when the only permanent artificial ice area in Czechoslovakia was a great success.\nCriticism.\nThe Czech Ice Hockey League faces long-standing criticism of the conditions of national team players, which are compared to modern slavery. One of the biggest critics of the League is the Association of Professional Ice Hockey Clubs (APK LH). Meanwhile, the first known hockey player to contract out of so many criticized tabloids is Adam Jehlička."

The Hilltoppers currently compete in Conference USA. The team's most recent appearance in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was in 2024. Hank Plona was announced as the team's current head coach on April 2, 2024.\nThe men's basketball program has the 16th most victories in the history of the NCAA and has attained the eighth best winning percentage in NCAA history. The school made an NCAA Final Four appearance in 1971, which was later vacated, and has made four NIT Final Four appearances, including three in the early days of the NIT when it was on par with the NCAA tournament. The program has won numerous Ohio Valley Conference championships and was very competitive in its previous conference, the Sun Belt Conference, regularly finishing near the top of the conference and competing for the conference championship. In 2014, the Hilltoppers joined Conference USA following conference realignment.\nStreet &amp; Smith's publication \"100 Greatest Programs\", ranked WKU #31. WKU has had 30 All Americans and 56 Hilltoppers have played professionally following their collegiate careers.\nPostseason.\nWKU has appeared in 41 national postseason tournaments and in five national final fours. The school currently has a policy of only accepting invitations to the NCAA or NIT tournaments, which precludes participation in other tournaments such as the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament and College Basketball Invitational.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Hilltoppers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times. Their combined record is 19–25. Their appearance in the 1971 NCAA Tournament and third-place finish were later vacated by the NCAA due to a player, Jim McDaniels, having signed a professional contract and accepted money during the season.\nNCAA Tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Hilltoppers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 15 times. When the NIT started, it was considered the premiere national college basketball tournament and remained on par with the NCAA Tournament through the mid-1950s, until the NCAA began giving automatic bids to conference champions in 1956. Western Kentucky's first eight appearances occurred during this early period, including their 2nd-place finish in 1942, 3rd place in 1948, and 4th place in 1954. WKU also made the NIT Final Four in 2018. Their combined record is 13–16.\nOther tournament results.\nIn 1936 Western Kentucky was invited to the National Olympic Playoffs representing the South. They played two games against the Southwest representative, Arkansas, in Little Rock, AK, losing both games by scores of 36–43 and 30–38.\nThe Hilltoppers were scheduled to appear in the 1938 National Intercollegiate Basketball tournament; however, the team was unable to make the trip and withdrew from the tournament. The NAIA lists the game as a forfeit, but Western Kentucky does not recognize the contest as part of their official record.\nThe Hilltoppers appeared in the 1951 National Campus Basketball Tournament where they were defeated by Bradley 71–75 in the first round.\nE.A. Diddle Arena.\nThe E.A. Diddle Arena is a 7,326-seat multi-purpose arena in Bowling Green, Kentucky, United States. The arena, built in 1963 is named after legendary WKU men's coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Edgar \"E.A.\" Diddle.\nRetired jerseys.\nThe first jerseys retired in honor of Hilltopper basketball greats were hung in E.A.

        "text": "The men's 4 × 100 metre medley relay event at the 1980 Summer Olympics was held in Moscow, Soviet Union on 24 July 1980 in the Olympiski Sports Complex. A total of 13 teams participated in the event. These were split over two heats held in the morning of that day, and the eight fastest teams qualified for the finals held in the evening of the same day.\nThe United States, the winner of all previous editions of this event, was boycotting the games in response to the Soviet–Afghan War. As a result, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden were expected to win. Australia's \"Quietly Confident Quartet\", however, composed of backstroker Mark Kerry, breaststroker Peter Evans, butterflyer Mark Tonelli, and freestyler Neil Brooks, surprisingly won the final in 3:45.70. They were followed by the silver medalists Soviet Union, 0.22 seconds in arrears, and the bronze medalists Great Britain, as favorites Sweden had been disqualified in the heats. , this is the only time the United States has not won the gold medal in the event.\nPreview.\nThe 1980 Summer Olympic Games were notable for a large number of boycotting countries as a result of the host country invading Afghanistan in 1979. As a result, several medal favorites for the men's 4 × 100 metre medley relay race were absent. The most notable absence was the United States, who had won the event every time since its inception at the 1960 Games, invariably by large margins, and would go on to win the event at all subsequent Games. Furthermore, they had also obtained the gold medal at the previous World Championships, just two years before the Olympiad. This, together with the boycott of the silver and bronze medallists from the previous edition, West Germany—who won the silver medal also at the World Championships—and Canada respectively, meant that the field had opened.\nSweden, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union were the most heavily favoured teams. Another ten National Olympic Committees were able to send teams to Moscow: Angola, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, East Germany, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Spain, and Vietnam. Favorites Soviet Union boasted the silver medalists in the 100 m finals hosted several days earlier in backstroke and breaststroke (Viktor Kuznetsov and Arsens Miskarovs respectively), while their butterflyer (Yevgeny Seredin) and freestyler (Sergey Kopliakov) had come fifth and fourth in their respective 100 m events. The British team included the 100 m breaststroke gold medallist (Duncan Goodhew), and fifth-place finisher in the 100 m backstroke (Gary Abraham). Sweden's butterflyer (Pär Arvidsson) and backstroker (Bengt Baron) had won their respective 100 m events, and their freestyle swimmer (Per Holmertz) had come second in the 100 m, while their lowest ranked swimmer, the breaststroker (Peter Berggren), had come ninth in the 100 m event.\nThe Australians were regarded as an outside chance for a medal, but were not seen as the main threats, as they were ranked seventh coming into the Olympics out of the 13 competing countries. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia had only won a silver in the inaugural race in Rome, and a bronze medal in Tokyo in 1964. On paper, Australia's team appeared much weaker than those of the other favorites: Peter Evans was the only individual medalist in the distance, claiming bronze in the 100 m breaststroke, while Neil Brooks, the freestyler, and Mark Kerry, the backstroker, had been eliminated in their respective semifinals, and Mark Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer.\nCompetition.\nHeats.\nThe medley relay was scheduled in the Olympiski Sports Complex for Thursday, 24 July, the fifth day of swimming competition, with heats from 11 am, and the final from 9 pm. In the morning Sweden was disqualified in the first heat, while Australia and the Soviet Union competed in the second heat. With their superior depth, the home team was able to rest their entire first-choice quartet in the heats, while Australia was only willing to rest Kerry, with Glenn Patching swimming the backstroke leg in his place. The hosts led the Australians from the start and extended their margin over each of the first three legs. Brooks reclaimed 1.34 s on the freestyle leg, but the Australians fell 0.13 s short to come second in their heat. Nevertheless, the Australians qualified in second place overall, as they and the Soviets were almost 2 s faster than the third-placed Hungarians. In any case, the home team, despite resting all of their first-choice quartet, were still faster than the Australians, who had rested only one. The winners of the first heat, Great Britain, had obtained a time slower than even the fourth-place finisher of the second heat, East Germany, and slower than the Soviets' by almost 3 seconds.\nFinal.\nThe Australian Evans took the opportunity to attempt to regain the psychological ascendancy from the Briton Goodhew, confronting him privately and stating that \"we will win it\", before noting that Goodhew was astounded by his posturing. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the Australian quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its \"de facto\" leader, and asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s in his career. Tonelli named the foursome as the \"Quietly Confident Quartet\", and they exhibited a silent assurance as they lined up for the race. Whereas most of the other teams were \"psyching up\" in the marshalling area, the Australians were remaining light-hearted, convinced that they could perform in the final.\nKerry led off the Australian team in a faster time than he had clocked in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time. Kerry finished in a time of 57.87 s, leaving Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead with a leadoff leg of 56.81 s with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was last to reach the 100 m mark, posting a time of 58.84 s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63 s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45 s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The remainder of the teams had been dropped, with a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a body length behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Tonelli's butterfly leg was such that if he had swum the same time in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36 s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81 s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more than a second clear of the third placed Great Britain.\nBrooks then made a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn to take the lead as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25 m to go before Brooks sprinted away again to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his teammates. In doing so, he recorded the fastest freestyle split in the relay, even faster than the individual 100 m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.\nAftermath.\nThe time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women, and it still remains the only time that the United States did not win the men's event. After the race, the team made a celebratory dive into the water and performed a poolside interview. Tonelli remarked that \"I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and my being the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it\". Australia's women's captain Lisa Forrest hailed the win as \"a gold medal that should never have been\". Evans said of the relay, \"It was unbelievable, but it was all so logical. I was so deliriously happy that I couldn't stop talking,\" as Brooks dedicated his win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas.\nUpon returning to Australia, Evans and Brooks were raucously received in their hometown of Perth. They were denied a civic reception by the Lord Mayor of Perth, Fred Chaney, because of his stance on Afghanistan, but the Mayor of Fremantle, Bill McKenzie, hosted one instead. Evans also received congratulations from Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. After being greeted as a hero, Brooks considered retiring as he felt that his gold had diminished his hunger for further success.\nThe quartet did not compete again as a unit following the Moscow Olympics, as Tonelli retired from swimming immediately after the Games. Australia came third in the 1984 Olympics in the medley relay as the Americans returned to the Olympic fold, with only Evans and Kerry of the original four swimming in the final, while Brooks swam in the heats. Evans and Kerry both retired after the 1984 Olympics, and after Brooks retired in 1986, the last of the \"Quietly Confident Quartet\" had departed the Australian swimming scene.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows."

        "title": "Florida State Seminoles men's basketball",
        "text": "The Florida State Seminoles men's basketball team represents Florida State University (variously Florida State or FSU) in the intercollegiate sport of basketball. The Seminoles compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\nThough they have historically played under the shadow of the football program, the Seminoles have had successes on the hardwood. Florida State has made eighteen NCAA tournament appearances: advancing to the \"Round of 32\" on twelve occasions, the \"Sweet Sixteen\" on seven occasions, the \"Elite Eight\" on three occasions, and the \"Final Four\" once, moving on to the championship game and finishing as runner-up. In 2020, despite holding final rankings of #4 in the AP Poll and #5 in the Coaches Poll, Florida State was \"declared\" the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Champions by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida State Legislature after the 2020 NCAA Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration holds no merit with the NCAA, but it is the only claim FSU basketball has to a national title. Florida State has also made ten appearances in the National Invitation Tournament.\nIn the 77 season history of the Seminole basketball program, the Seminoles have won the regular season conference title five times and the conference tournament title four times, including two ACC championships.\nFlorida State has had 23 All-Americans, 26 players inducted into the Hall of Fame, and 36 players that went on to play in the NBA. Jeff Sagarin and ESPN listed the program 74th in the college basketball all-time rankings in the 'ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia'.\nThe Seminoles play their home games in the Donald L. Tucker Center on the university's Tallahassee, Florida campus. The current head men's basketball coach is Leonard Hamilton, in his twenty-second year.\nIn the 2023-24 season, Head Mop Manager Michael Rubin joined the staff with his signature all gold practice outfit. His constant energy and positive enthusiasm fires up the squad daily.\nOverview.\nThe Florida State Seminoles men's team annually plays an eighteen-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule against few annual opponents except for Florida. Their conference schedule consists of a home-and-home game against two permanent rivals (Miami and Clemson), alternating home-and-home games against the other fourteen ACC teams.\nHistory.\nFlorida State University has officially fielded a basketball team since 1947.\nDon Loucks era (1947–1948).\nHugh Donald Loucks served as the first basketball coach for the Florida State Seminoles. He coached at the school for one year and compiled an overall record of 5–13, becoming one of only two coaches to leave the program with a losing record of 11 games.\nJ.K. Kennedy era (1949–1966).\nAfter the departure of Loucks, J.K. Kennedy became the coach. He was the first coach to find success at Florida State, holding the position for 18 years and compiling a record of 234–208.\nHugh Durham era (1966–1978).\nHugh Durham played at Florida State in the 1950s, scoring 1,381 points in three years. His average of 21.9 points per game in 1958–59 is the seventh best tally in Florida State history. Durham's career average of 18.9 points per game is still the ninth best in school history. After his playing career had ended, he began his coaching career as an assistant coach in 1959. Seven years later, Durham would be named head coach in 1966. One of the top players during this time was future NBA Hall-of-Famer Dave Cowens. Durham led the Seminoles from 1966 to 1978. In 1972, Durham led Florida State to a runner-up finish in the NCAA Tournament. A hard-fought 81–76 loss to the top-ranked UCLA Bruins in the NCAA Championship game prevented Durham's Florida State team from winning the NCAA tournament. Another key player for the Seminoles was Harry Davis, who helped the program sustain stability.\nDurham's overall record at Florida State was a 230–95 record with three NCAA tournament bids. He still owns the highest winning percentage of any Florida State coach at .708. Durham is the only coach in NCAA history to be the all-time winningest coach (percentage or wins) at three different Division I schools.\nJoe Williams era (1978–1986).\nAfter the departure of Hugh Durham, Joe Williams took over the Seminole basketball program. One of the standout players during this period was George McCloud. McCloud helped the Seminoles rebuild after the departure of Durham by becoming one of the most prolific scorers in FSU history. During his senior season, McCloud had the second-highest scoring average and the sixth-highest in Florida State history. Joe Williams would coach his final season in 1986.\nPat Kennedy era (1986–1997).\nThe 1992–1993 season would see the emergence of one of the Seminoles' best players in its history, Bob Sura. Not much was expected of the Seminoles in 1992 as they entered into their first season in the ACC, yet they finished second in the conference to national champion Duke. The team repeated the second-place finish in 1993, establishing itself as a legitimate national power. In the 1993 NCAA Tournament they fell to Kentucky in the Elite Eight round. In Kennedy's final season (1996–1997) he led the team to the NIT Final, losing to the Michigan Wolverines.\nSteve Robinson era (1997–2002).\nSteve Robinson took over the program for the 1997–1998 season and led the Seminoles to the NCAA Tournament his first year. However, the team suffered losing records the next four seasons and Robinson left the program after the 2001–2002 campaign. Robinson is now an assistant coach with the Arizona Wildcats.\nLeonard Hamilton era (2002–present).\nLeonard Hamilton became Florida State's seventh head basketball coach on March 19, 2002. In two years, Tim Pickett scored 1,039 points, earning him First-Team All-ACC and All-American Honorable Mention honors. Hamilton was named ACC Coach of the Year in 2009, 2012, and 2020. Hamilton is also the first Seminole coach to win an ACC Championship, capturing the league tournament title in 2012 and the regular season title in 2020. He has led the Seminoles to eight NCAA tournament appearances. During his tenure, Florida State has been the third-most successful team in the conference. Hamilton is the winningest coach in the program's history, the fifth winningest coach in conference history, and has sent nineteen players to the NBA draft, including nine first round picks.\nHome court.\nDonald L. Tucker Center.\nThe Seminoles play all of their home games at the Donald L. Tucker Center. It is a multi-purpose facility which has hosted over 25 years worth of Seminole games. Since the 2016–2017 season, the Seminoles have gone undefeated twice at home and had twenty-five consecutive conference victories on their home court, the second longest streak in conference history.\nChampionships.\nNational Championship appearance.\nFlorida State has appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament's National Championship game once, in 1972. The Seminoles, coached by Hugh Durham, lost to John Wooden and his UCLA Bruins, 81–76, at the Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California. The Seminoles defeated powerhouse Kentucky in the Mideast Region Final and North Carolina in the Final Four. \nRegional Championship.\nFlorida State defeated Kentucky, 73–54, to win their only regional championship.\nNIT Championship appearance.\nFlorida State has appeared in the National Invitation Tournament's National Championship game once, in 1997. The Seminoles, coached by Pat Kennedy, lost to Michigan, coached by Steve Fisher, 82–73, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. \nConference tournament championships.\nConference Affiliations\nRecords and results.\nYear-by-year results.\nNote: W = Wins, L = Losses, C = Conference\nPolls.\nFlorida State has ended their basketball season ranked 15 times in either the AP or Coaches Poll.\n\"Top-10 finishes are colored ██\"\nA second-place ranking is the best the team has ever received.\nRegular season tournaments.\nACC-Big Ten Challenge.\nThe Seminoles participated in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge 24 times, compiling a record of 10–14.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Seminoles have appeared in the NCAA tournament 18 times.

        "text": "Anthony Tremaine Hills (born November 4, 1984) is a former American football offensive tackle who won championships at both the collegiate and pro levels. He spent nine years in the National Football League (NFL) and played in six seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos, Indianapolis Colts, Dallas Cowboys, and New Orleans Saints. He also spent time in training camp or on practice squads with the Buffalo Bills, Oakland Raiders, Miami Dolphins, Carolina Panthers, Baltimore Ravens, and Detroit Lions. He won a Super Bowl ring, for Super Bowl XLIII, with Pittsburgh and played in another Super Bowl, Super Bowl XLV, with the same team. \nHe was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round of the 2008 NFL Draft. \nHe was an All-American at the University of Texas where he won a National Championship.\nEarly years.\nThough born in Dallas, Hills grew up in Houston, where he was an All-State tight end and Parade All-American at Alief Elsik High School. During Hills' senior year, he was rated by some scouting services as the top tight end prospect in the country, and he committed to play college football at Texas. His team reached the 5A state semifinals, but lost 30-21 to Converse Judson. During that game, Hills suffered a severe injury to his peroneal nerve and was told that he might not be able to play football again. He underwent two surgeries and lengthy rehabilitation before reporting to Texas (which was honoring his scholarship despite the injury) in spring 2004.\nCollege career.\nHills attended the University of Texas, where he was forced to redshirt the 2003 season after reconstructive surgery on his left knee following a career-threatening injury (nerve damage). When he returned, he was moved from tight end to offensive tackle, and appeared in 31 games during his first three seasons (2004–2006). In 2005, he was part of the Longhorn team that won the National Championship. As a junior in 2006, Hills started at left tackle in all 13 games of the season. He started the Longhorns' first 11 games of 2007, but suffered a fractured left fibula that cost him the last two games. Nonetheless, that season he made the Walter Camp All-American team, was on the Outland Trophy watch list and was a first-team All-Big 12 selection. During his four years with the Longhorns, they won four straight bowl games, the 2004 and 2005 Rose Bowls, the 2006 Alamo Bowl and the 2007 Holiday Bowl.\nProfessional career.\n2008 NFL Draft.\nHills was considered to be part of a strong group of offensive tackles and was seen by most analysts as a third-round pick. He was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round with the 130th pick.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nHills spent three seasons with the Steelers. He was with the team when they won Super Bowl XLIII, though he did not play in that game. He played in 4 games during the 2010 season and played in Super Bowl XLV. Prior to the start of the 2011 season, he was released by the Steelers.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn September 6, 2011, he signed with the Denver Broncos. He was only active for one game for the Broncos and was cut prior to the 2012 season.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nA few weeks after being cut by the Broncos, he was signed to the Indianapolis Colts practice squad. On October 6, 2012, he was promoted to the roster. He played in 6 games for the Colts during the 2012 season and recorded the only start of his career.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn July 28, 2013, Hills signed with the Buffalo Bills as a free agent, but was released by them a few weeks later.\nOakland Raiders.\nTwo days after being cut by the Bills, on August 20, 2013, Hills was signed by the Oakland Raiders, but they cut him 11 days later.\nMiami Dolphins.\nAfter sitting out the 2013 season, Hills was signed by the Miami Dolphins on July 28, 2014. He was moved to the practice squad before the season started. He was cut by the Dolphins in mid-October.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn October 15, 2014 Hills was signed by the Dallas Cowboys on the same day he was cut by the Dolphins. He played in 3 games for the Cowboys during the 2014 season.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn July 28, 2015, Hills was signed by the Carolina Panthers as a free agent, but was cut by them before the season started.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nA few weeks after being cut by the Panthers, Hills was signed by the Baltimore Ravens to their practice squad, but was released after 5 days. On September 21, 2015, he was waived by the Ravens.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn October 6, 2015, shortly after being cut by the Ravens, Hills signed with the New Orleans Saints, his tenth team of his NFL career. Expected to be only a backup in his first game after signing, a nationally televised Thursday Night Football game against Atlanta, he ended up playing left tackle for most of the game after an injury to Saints rookie Andrus Peat. Hills ultimately played in 8 games for the Saints in 2015. He started the 2016 off-season as a free agent, but returned to the Saints on August 1, 2016.

        "title": "Cycling in London",
        "text": "Cycling is a popular mode of transport and leisure activity within London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. Following a national decline in the 1960s of levels of utility cycling, cycling as a mode of everyday transport within London began a slow regrowth in the 1970s. This continued until the beginning of the 21st century, when levels began to increase significantly—during the period from 2000 to 2012, the number of daily journeys made by bicycle in Greater London doubled to 580,000. The growth in cycling can partly be attributed to the launch in 2010 by Transport for London (TfL) of a cycle hire system throughout the city's centre. By 2013, the scheme was attracting a monthly ridership of approximately 500,000, peaking at a million rides in July of that year. Health impact analyses have shown that London would benefit more from increased cycling and cycling infrastructure than other European cities.\nCycling conditions in the city have in recent years been perceived as unsafe by cyclists. A spate of cycling deaths in London occurred in November 2013, drawing criticism of TfL's cycle facilities and sparking protests and calls for safety improvements from politicians, cycling organisations and the media, as well as differing views on the extent to which poor cycling contributes to safety risks for both cyclists and other road users.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nThe popularity of cycling during the 19th century is in itself cyclical, consisting of several short periods of bicycle booms followed by a sharp decline in popularity.\nBicycles first made their way to London in 1818 via the carriage maker Denis Johnson, having imported and improved upon the original design by Karl von Drais, from which they acquired the name , though its popularity among predominantly young male members of the aristocracy quickly gathered it the nickname 'dandy horse'. These designs lacked the pedals common to modern bicycles and were instead propelled by the action of the rider's feet on the ground. While briefly popular in the following years, slopes were challenging both to climb and descend, and riders were widely mocked in the streets and newspapers while the London College of Surgeons condemned the practice of cycling as dangerous. Its popularity soon fell out of fashion. In the following years a number of designs were proposed, tested, and built, attempting to remedy the drawbacks of the design, including tricycles and quadricycles, or the tandem bicycle. None gained widespread popularity.\nIt was not until the invention of the first 'true bicycles' in the 1860s, powered by the action of the rider's feet on two pedals driving a single wheel, did cycling gain significant popularity again. Originally called velocipedes, the lack of suspension, rough Victorian roads, and metal-rimmed tyres soon gathered them the nickname 'boneshakers'.\nA further development was to move the rider directly above the forward wheel, allowing the rider to fully extend their leg with each cycle and thus deliver the most power, resulting in the ordinary bicycle, more commonly known as the penny farthing. However this made the machine dangerously unstable - in the event of an upset, the rider would likely be thrown forward over the handlebars. Consequently, its popularity lay predominantly among young middle and upper-class men who were more accepting of the risks. Older men, and women of all ages, preferred safer designs such as the tricycle, but the high cost conferred by the additional mechanical complexity meant that such machines were rarely seen. Among those who did ride, cycling developed as both a recreational and social activity, particularly among middle and upper class townsfolk taking advantage of their new machines to enjoy day trips through the nearby countryside. The village of Ripley, lying on the popular London to Winchester route, was declared \"the Mecca of all good cyclists\". Other popular destinations included Thames Ditton and Box Hill.\nSome riders joined one of the many cycling clubs formed in this period. Club members would often ride together on shared excursions, often behind a recognised club Captain and his Lieutenants, with orders given by the club bugler or by whistle. Membership of such clubs could be exclusive, and the distinctive club uniforms conferred social opportunities even as a lone rider at the many rest stops.\nThe first recognisably modern bicycle, with equal-sized wheels and pedals driving the rear wheel via a chain mechanism, was the Rover safety bicycle of 1885. The invention of the pneumatic tyre in 1888 and the associated ride quality improvements only added to its popularity, triggering the third great bike boom which would last through the 1890s. First Battersea Park and then Hyde Park were popular with new cyclists seeking a space to learn to ride.\nThe introduction of the drop-frame bicycle in 1889, based on the design of the safety but without the crossbar between the rider's legs, allowed women to ride comfortably for the first time while wearing the long skirts typical of Victorian fashion. Cycling was one of the few activities a woman could take part in without a male chaperone, and while the bicycle changed how men took part in the same activities they had previously, for women the bicycle provided new opportunities and access to activities previously closed off to them, and from the image of women on bicycles enjoying their newfound freedom of movement outside the immediate proximity to the home emerged the image of the new woman. Several prominent feminist writers commented on the freedom the bicycle provided women and advocated others to take up riding. Susan Hamilton, Countess of Malmesbury, pronounced the sport \"one of the greatest blessings given to modern women\", and John Galsworthy would write the bicycle had \"been responsible for more movement in manners and morals than anything since Charles the Second\". Such changes did not come without significant pushback from more traditionalist factions. The female cyclist was seen as violating the separate spheres ideology prevalent at the time, and accused of attempting to become a man. Opposition ranged from satirical caricatures in the newspapers, to poor service provided at inns and cafes, to verbal and in some cases physical abuse directed at riders, including an instance of a meat hook thrown at a rider in Kilburn. Particular attention was directed towards riders dressed in rational dress, who rejected the traditional long skirts and corsets typical of Victorian women's fashion in favour of bloomers and other more practical forms of clothing especially suited to cycling. Despite the opposition, women continued to ride, with one in three bicycles ordered in 1895 placed by women.\n20th century.\nLondon's first segregated cycle track was introduced in 1934, between Hanger Lane and Greenford. Although the facility was well-used for cycling, segregation was opposed by cycling organisations at the time, fearing loss of rights to ride on the highway.\nBeginning in the 1960s, Britain experienced a decline in levels of utility cycling due to the increasing wealth of its populace and greater affordability of motor vehicles; this in turn led to the favouring of vehicular traffic over other options by transportation planners. In 1977, the Conservative Party won the Greater London Council (GLC) election, and enacted policies that deprioritised spending on public transport.\nIn 1980 Ken Livingstone, at the time the Labour Party's transport spokesperson, made a promise to the London Cycling Campaign (LCC) that should Labour take control of the GLC they would spend more on the needs of cyclists. In May 1981, Labour won the GLC election, with Livingstone becoming GLC leader shortly afterwards. The following month, Livingstone announced that the GLC would accede to the LCC's demands, creating a cycling planning unit and spending at least 1% of the yearly transport budget, £2m, on cycling.\n21st century.\nIn 2000, Livingstone became the first elected Mayor of London, and in 2008 set a target of a 400% increase in cycling between 2008 and 2025. On 9 February 2008 Livingstone announced an estimated £400 million of initiatives to improve and increase cycling and walking, including thousands of new bike parking facilities at railway and tube stations. To be co-ordinated by the TfL and London boroughs, the aims include having one in ten Londoners making a round trip by bike each day and five per cent of all daily trips by bike by 2025.\nIn 2011 around 2.5 per cent of all commutes to work in London were by bike, though the figure was as high as 9% in Hackney. This compared to other cities in the United Kingdom such as Cardiff (4.3 per cent), York (18 per cent) and Cambridge (28 per cent of commutes) and to cities in mainland Europe such as Berlin (13 per cent), Munich (15 per cent), and Amsterdam (37 per cent of all journeys). The amount of growth has varied between regions within the city; on some routes such as Cheapside cyclists have been reported to comprise over half of rush-hour traffic.\nPlans to construct twelve \"Cycle Superhighway\" routes were announced by Livingstone in 2008, connecting inner and outer London, as well as providing cycle zones around urban centres. Livingstone lost the subsequent mayoral election to Conservative Boris Johnson in May 2008, and the new mayor promised to continue to support cycling.\nIn July 2010, two pilot routes were implemented with Cycle Superhighway 3 (CS3) connecting Barking in East London with Tower Hill on the eastern perimeter of The City of London and Cycle Superhighway 7 (CS7) linking Colliers Wood in South London to Bank in the city. CS7 was criticised by rival cycling commentators and campaigners for relying on \"blue paint\" and bus lanes to protect cyclists from motor traffic, without using kerbed cycle tracks. CS3 was more popular, although critics argued that much of it had existed already, and had simply been rebranded as a Superhighway. Campaigners argued that the Mayor's rhetoric prior to launch had promised a much higher standard of cycling facility, yet the Superhighways encouraged cyclists on to busy main roads in conflict with buses and other motor traffic, with significant risk of being hit by left-turning vehicles at major junctions.\nIn July 2010, 6,000 bicycles became available for short-term rental from TfL under the Barclays Cycle Hire at 400 docking stations in nine central London boroughs. This was later expanded to 8,000 cycles from 570 stations, and is now branded Santander Cycles. The scheme, run by Montreal-based PBSC Urban Solutions, initially covered about 17 square miles (44 square kilometres). The docking stations were spaced apart, and sited mainly at key destinations and tube stations. There is a charge for hire, although there was an initial period of free use to promote the scheme. The scheme was designed based on a feasibility study produced by German Dector-Vega and Charles Snead in November 2008.\nOver the next few years, pressure from campaign groups, bloggers and everyday cyclists using social media and on-street demonstrations brought the state of London's roads for cycling to the attention of the media. Eventually, this led to significant new investment in safer cycle infrastructure for London. In March 2013, City Hall announced £1 billion of improvements to make cycling safer and easier in London, as well as to improve air pollution and inner city congestion in the capital. Boris Johnson, Livingstone's replacement as Mayor of London, planned to build a 15-mile \"Crossrail for bikes\" running from the West London suburbs across the Westway, through Hyde Park, the Mall and along the Victoria Embankment past Canary Wharf and into East London.\nIn March 2013 \"The Mayor's Vision for Cycling in London\" was announced, a plan which includes a \"Crossrail for bikes\" running a fully segregated route from east to west across London to be in place by 2016. The statement also announced a Central London \"bike grid\" which would join up and improve existing cycle routes in Zone 1, as well as a network of \"Quietways\" in outer London, and E-bikes for rent in hilly areas of the city. The London Cycle Hire Scheme has been described by the deputy mayor as \"oozing\" out over London with expansion in 2014 in Hackney, Notting Hill, Hammersmith, Fulham and Wandsworth.\nIn December 2013, TfL published a draft map of a \"Central London Grid\" of new cycle routes.\nIn February 2017 Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council agreed to set up a social prescribing trial as part of the Go Cycle campaign, in which GPs, physiotherapists and mental health professionals can refer patients for a free 12-week course with professional cycle coaches and qualified instructors.\nThe Obike dockless hire scheme launched in London in July 2017 followed by introduction of the Lime and Uber e-bike schemes.\nFacilities.\nCycle lanes and paths.\nOn-road cycle lanes vary. Some have raised concrete kerbs that separate people cycling from other traffic, whilst others are defined by lines painted on the road surface. The first Cycle Superhighways went into use in May 2010, and the first Quietways in 2016.\nCycle paths include routes through the royal parks (St. James's Park, Hyde Park, Regent's Park and Green Park), along the Thames Path and London's canals and waterways. There is a behavioural code for considerate riding on London's towpaths.\nOn public transport.\nFolding bicycles may be carried on almost all public transport in London. Full-size bicycles may be carried on some sections of the transport network during certain hours of the day. Bicycle parking facilities, generally cycle stands, but in some cases more secure facilities, are available at many stations.\nSafety.\nMany roads in London are lined with guardrail, and cyclist deaths have occurred when motor vehicles crushed people against the rail as they cycled. In 2007, TfL set a policy of the use of guardrail only in locations where it has been proven to be a requirement for safety, and began a programme of removing it where possible. By 2010, of the of guardrail on the Transport for London Road Network had been removed.\nIn 2008 Ken Livingstone announced that councils would be able to set borough-wide limits without a requirement for special enforcement measures. Islington and Southwark subsequently imposed borough-wide 20 mph zones, with Camden announcing plans to introduce the same system in 2012. The City of London imposed a borough-wide 20 mph limit in July 2014. Such zones are backed by cycling groups, who support traffic speed restrictions for both encouraging walking and cycling, and making them safer.\nIn January 2013 Boris Johnson appointed London's first Cycling Commissioner, tasked with making it a safer and more popular mode of transport in the capital, and announced that segregated cycle facilities would be built across London as part of a package of measures designed to improve cyclist safety.\nIn June 2013 TfL announced the creation of a \"Safe Streets for London\" plan. The plan aims to cut road deaths by 40% by 2020 via a range of measures, including redesigning \"critical\" major junctions and streets, installing more and upgrading existing traffic enforcement cameras, working with London boroughs to implement more 20 mph speed limit zones, modifying heavy goods vehicles with safety equipment, and offering cycle training to every school pupil in London.\nLater the same year, it was claimed that half of cyclists still routinely ignored red stop lights at typical junctions in London, with the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association releasing two-hour-long rush hour videos that they said backed up drivers' daily experience that cyclists illegally using the pavement, running red lights or weaving in and out of vehicles, were not a small minority. The London Cycling Campaign said that police figures indicated far more of cyclists' accidents were caused by poor driving than by ignoring red lights, although a survey indicated that more than half of cyclists admitted ignoring a red light at least once.\nThe following year the London Cycling Campaign participated in a safety initiative with the Guide Dogs charity stressing that cyclists have a duty of care to be considerate to other road users, and pedestrians in particular, after the charity found that one in four blind and partially-sighted people in London had been hit by a cyclist, and seven in ten suffered a near miss, with cyclists commonly riding on pavements at speed or running red lights.\nStatistics.\nThe number of daily bicycle journeys in London has increased by 314% since the 1990s, from 270,000 daily journeys in 1993 to 1,118,000 in 2022. Jan-Aug 2023 has an average 1,172,000 daily journeys (5% increase on 2022 and 7% decrease on 2020), 3 fatalities and 626 seriously injured. \nA study of deaths of cyclists in London published in 2010 in the research journal \"BMC Public Health\" stated that \"the biggest threat [to cyclists] remains freight vehicles, involved in more than 4 out of 10 incidents, with over half turning left at the time of the crash.\"\n2013 deaths.\nIn November 2013, six cyclists were killed on London streets within a two-week period, bringing the number of cyclists killed in London in the year to 14, nine of which involved a heavy goods vehicle (HGV). In response, the Metropolitan Police announced an initiative called \"Operation Safeway\", in which 2,500 traffic police were stationed at major junctions throughout the city to issue fixed penalty notices to road users breaking road traffic laws and offer advice to vulnerable road users. Following the deaths, Boris Johnson stated in an interview on BBC Radio that cyclists were endangering their lives when not following road traffic laws, making it \"very difficult for the traffic engineers to second-guess [their actions]\". The comments were immediately condemned as \"deflecting blame onto cyclists [and] grossly insensitive\" by Roger Geffen, campaigns and policy director of the Cyclists' Touring Club, and as \"dodging responsibility\" and \"an insult to the dead and injured\" by Darren Johnson, the Green Party member of the London Assembly. Former Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman, policy director for British Cycling, the national governing body for cycle racing in Great Britain, called on Johnson to ban HGVs from some London roads during peak hours, saying that Johnson had made a verbal promise to him \"to look at the successful experiences of Paris and many other cities in restricting the movements of heavy vehicles during peak hours\". Johnson stated in a radio interview that he was unconvinced by the idea, but was however considering banning cyclists from wearing headphones while riding. However, the traffic division of the Metropolitan Police were unable to identify any serious cycling incidents in which headphone use could be identified as a contributing factor.\nTwo weeks after the sixth death, a protest campaign organised via social media held a die-in—modelled on the Dutch \"Stop de Kindermoord\" pro-cycling demonstrations of the 1970s—outside the headquarters of TfL, in which over 1,000 cyclists lay silently in the road and held a vigil for cyclists and pedestrians killed by road traffic.\nA BBC poll taken in December 2013 found that one fifth of regular cycle commuters had stopped cycling to work as a result of the recent spate of deaths. A fifth of the survey respondents had also been involved in a collision, and 68% believed that London's roads were not safe to cycle on."

At the age of 14 he was the youngest ever player to make a maximum 147 break in competition, a record that has since been beaten by Judd Trump. At the 2012 World Snooker Championship, Jones reached his first ranking quarter-final. He made his second appearance in the quarter-finals of a Triple Crown tournament at the 2016 UK Championship.\nJones made his first official maximum break in the third frame of his last-64 match against Lee Walker at the 2018 Paul Hunter Classic. It was his first professional maximum break.\nIn October 2018, Jones was suspended from the snooker tour pending a match-fixing investigation. The match in question was a 2016 International Championship qualifier between former world champion Graeme Dott and Jones's good friend and compatriot David John.\nIn January 2019, Jones was acquitted of match-fixing following a hearing at which he was represented by sports barrister Craig Harris. However, he admitted to having prior knowledge of an approach to fix the aforementioned match and failed to report it, so was subsequently banned for a year himself. While his ban finished in October 2019, due to missing out most of the 2018–19 season, he ended the campaign outside of the top 64 and officially dropped off the tour.\nJones officially rejoined the tour two seasons later, coming through the second Q-School event of 2020, defeating Michael Georgiou. He had come close to regaining professional status in Event 1, only losing in the penultimate round to compatriot Lee Walker, who also went on to gain a tour card.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nIn 2002, aged 14, Jones became the youngest-ever player to make a 147 in an official event, a record that has since been beaten by Judd Trump. Jones began his professional career by playing Challenge Tour in 2004, at the time the second-level professional tour. He qualified for the Main Tour for 2006/2007 by finishing top of the 2005/06 Welsh rankings, although he could not maintain his place there. His best result in his first season as a professional was to the last 48 of the Royal London Watches Grand Prix. After another spell on the tour in 2008–09, after which he was again relegated, he regained a place for the 2010–11 season due to his position in the International Open Series, a qualifying route to the professional ranks.\n2010/2011 season.\nJones started the new season by winning three qualifying matches in the Shanghai Masters, beating Kuldesh Johal, Jimmy Michie and Adrian Gunnell before losing to Stephen Lee. After reaching the final of Players Tour Championship – Event 5, Jones rose to 47 in the rankings at the end of the season.\n2011/2012 season.\nJones made it to the quarter-finals of three Players Tour Championship events, but failed to progress further in any of them. However, his consistent performances meant he finished 23rd in the Order of Merit and therefore qualified for the 2012 PTC Finals, where he reached the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time by defeating reigning World Champion John Higgins 4 frames to 3, after being 1–3 down. This set up a match with Andrew Higginson, which he lost 3–4. Jones won two qualifying matches to reach the China Open, but lost 3–5 to Lu Ning in the wildcard round.\nJones finished the season by qualifying for the 2012 World Championship, beating Ricky Walden 10–2 in the final qualifying round. He then beat Shaun Murphy 10–8 in the first round, scoring two centuries. In the second round he beat Andrew Higginson 13–10, included a 135 break in the penultimate frame, to reach his first ever ranking event quarter-final. In the quarter-final he was defeated 11–13 by former world number 2 Ali Carter, but made back-to-back clearances of 138 and 132 in frames 11 and 12, coming back from 12–8 to 12–11 before eventual runner-up Carter won the match. Jones made seven centuries during the tournament, with only eventual winner Ronnie O'Sullivan making more. Jones finished the season ranked a career high world number 29, meaning he had risen 18 places during the year.\n2012/2013 season.\nFollowing his superb run in last season's World Championship, Jones endured a difficult 2012–13 season. He could only win three matches in ranking event qualifiers all year, with his sole appearance in the main draw coming at the Shanghai Masters.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He beat Jimmy White in qualifying and Lu Ning in the wildcard round, but was then defeated 5–2 by John Higgins in the first round. He fared better in the Players Tour Championship events, with his best result coming at the Paul Hunter Classic, where he had wins over Jimmy Robertson, Jak Jones and Li Yan, before losing 4–2 to compatriot Ryan Day. He finished 67th on the PTC Order of Merit. Jones could not repeat last season's run to The Crucible as he was beaten 10–9 by Liam Highfield in the third round of World Championship Qualifying. His disappointing year was reflected in the rankings as he dropped 11 places to finish world number 40.\n2013/2014 season.\nJones reached the first round of the 2013 Wuxi Classic, but lost 5–4 to Liang Wenbo. He qualified for five more ranking events but was beaten in the opening round of each.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He had a very good year in the eight minor-ranking European Tour events, losing in the last 16 in two of them. His deepest finish came at the Kay Suzanne Memorial Cup where he beat Ian Burns 4–2 in the quarter-finals. In the semis he was edged out 4–3 by Judd Trump and finished 15th on the Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals for the third time in four years. Jones lost 4–2 to Mark Allen in the first round. His drop down the rankings continued as he ended the season as the world number 55.\n2014/2015 season.\nAt the 2014 Wuxi Classic, Jones defeated Ken Doherty 5–2, before losing 5–3 to Marco Fu in the second round.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won three matches to qualify for the Australian Goldfields Open and thrashed Stephen Maguire 5–0, before being the victim of a whitewash in the second round by Neil Robertson. The next match Jones could win at the venue stage of a ranking event was at the Welsh Open, 4–0 over Chris Norbury. In the second round he knocked out Shaun Murphy 4–3 and stated that he plays his best snooker in the televised stages of tournaments. In an all-Welsh affair, Jones lost 4–2 to Mark Williams in the third round. He then reached the last 16 in back-to-back ranking tournaments, losing 4–1 to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh at the Indian Open and 5–3 to Murphy at the China Open. Jones qualified for his second World Championship by beating Adam Duffy 10–8 in the final round. He suffered a heavy 10–2 loss to Neil Robertson in the first round. However, Jones halted his slide down the rankings as he climbed 17 spots this season to end it 38th.\n2015/2016 season.\nAfter edging Mark Davis 5–4 in the opening round of the Australian Goldfields Open, Jones thrashed Mark Selby 5–1 and said that he hoped running during the off-season would give himself a better chance of winning more matches this season. He played friend and former schoolmate Michael White in the quarter-finals with Jones recovering from 4–2 down to tie the match at 4–4. In the deciding frame White made a break of 56, before missing a red and Jones cleared with a 66 to reach the first ranking semi-final of his career. He raced into a 4–0 lead over John Higgins, but then lost six frames in a row to exit the tournament. Jones beat Ian Glover 6–4 and Xiao Guodong 6–1 at the UK Championship and made two centuries against Selby, but lost 6–5 with Selby stating that Jones had deserved to win the match. He played in three more ranking events, but lost in the first round of each and his season was ended with a 10–5 loss to Hamza Akbar in World Championship qualifying, who had previously lost all eight of his matches on tour.\n2016/2017 season.\nJones dropped just two frames in reaching the quarter-finals of the 2016 Paul Hunter Classic, but then lost 4–1 to Tom Ford.&lt;ref name=\"2016/17\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the UK Championship he saw off Eden Sharav 6–1 in the first round and then had a trio of 6–2 victories over Alan McManus, Ding Junhui and David Gilbert to mean he had made two ranking event quarter-finals in the same season for the first time in his career. Jones had a great chance to reach his second semi-final as he led Marco Fu 5–2, but he would go on to lose 6–5.\nJones was 4–0 ahead of Graeme Dott in the final qualifying round for the World Championship, but was beaten 10–8.\n2020/2021 season.\nJones returned to the tour from a ban after qualifying through Q-School. He had a strong start to the season, including a run to the semi-finals of the 2020 Scottish Open, where he ultimately lost 6–1 to Mark Selby. Jones continued to perform well in tournaments, and at the 2021 World Championship, a 10–5 victory over Li Hang in the final qualifying round saw him make his fourth Crucible appearance. In the first round, he faced Stephen Maguire, and having trailed 3–0 in the early stages of that match, he won ten out of the next eleven frames to run out a 10-4 winner. He then faced Stuart Bingham in the last 16, and although the first session was shared 4-4, Jones only won two more frames, losing the match 13–6. He finished the season ranked 55th.\n2021/2022 season.\nJones had a much quieter season than his previous one, which included a first round exit at the 2021 UK Championship, where he lost 6–1 to Cao Yupeng. At the Scottish Open, he reached the last 16, where he lost 4–3 to Ronnie O'Sullivan. At the Gibraltar Open, he reached the quarter-finals, before losing 4–1 to Ricky Walden. At the 2022 World Championship, he beat Mark Joyce 6–1, and Tom Ford 10–5 in qualifying.

        "title": "1956 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1956 Rose Bowl was the 42nd edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Monday, January 2. The Michigan State Spartans of the Big Ten Conference defeated the UCLA Bruins of the Pacific Coast Conference, 17–14. Michigan State halfback Walt Kowalczyk was named the Player of the Game.\nThe game featured two of the most racially integrated college football teams of the day, with six African American players for the Bruins and seven for the Spartans. This stood in stark contrast to the Sugar Bowl, where there was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt should be allowed to play and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all, due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Only one month previous, Rosa Parks made her famous protest in the Montgomery bus boycott. The 1956 Rose Bowl has the highest TV rating of all college bowl games, watched by 41.1% of all people in the US with TV sets.\nAs New Year's Day fell on a Sunday in 1956, the bowl games were played the following day.\nTeams.\nMichigan State College Spartans.\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes were the undefeated Big Ten conference champions. However, Ohio State would not be invited to the Rose Bowl because of the no-repeat rule in the Big Ten conference. This left Michigan State to be accepted. Ohio State was ranked fourth with a 7–2 record, and Michigan State was second with a 9–1 record. The teams did not play each other during the regular season. Michigan State opened with a 20–13 win at Indiana, but fell to in-state rival Michigan 14–7, their only setback of the season. They won 38–14 over then-#20 Stanford, and defeated then-#4 Notre Dame 21–7. The Spartans did not play Northwestern, Iowa, or Ohio State. The Buckeyes' two losses were out of conference, to Duke (20–14) and Stanford (6–0).\nUCLA Bruins.\nUCLA was the defending national champion after an undefeated season in 1954. The Bruins began the 1955 season ranked number one. In a showdown at #5 Maryland, the Bruins lost 0–7 to the Terrapins. A 38–0 win over Oregon State ultimately proved to be the game for the conference championship. The Bruins won the rest of their regular season games, including a 21–13 win over Stanford. With the Pacific Coast conference championship already won, the Bruins won their third straight rivalry game over USC 17–7.\nPre-game activities.\nIn a \"Sports Illustrated\" article preceding the 1956 Rose Bowl, UCLA head coach Red Sanders was quoted as saying \"Sure, winning isn't every thing, It's the only thing.\"\nCoaches Duffy Daugherty and Red Sanders appeared on \"The Jack Benny Program\" \"New Years Day\" 1956 episode on Sunday, January 1, 1956, preceding the game to be played the next day.\nGame summary.\nThis was the second meeting between the two schools, the first was a 28–20 victory for the Spartans two years earlier in the 1954 Rose Bowl. The Spartans wore their green home jerseys and the Bruins wore their white road jerseys.\nOn the first play from scrimmage, Jim Decker of UCLA intercepted a pass from Michigan State quarterback Earl Morrall, and returned four yards to the MSU 16-yard line. Four plays later, Bob Davenport scored on a two-yard run over left guard to give the Bruins a 7–0 lead.\nMidway through the second quarter, Michigan State put together an 11-play, 80-yard drive to pull even at seven; Walt Kowalczyk's 30-yard run to the UCLA 17 set up Morrall's 13-yard touchdown toss to Clarence Peaks. There was no additional scoring through the third quarter.\nOn the second play of the fourth quarter, the Spartans took their first lead at 14–7 on Peaks’ 67-yard touchdown pass to John Lewis, who caught the ball on the 50 and took it the distance. Five minutes later, The UCLA Bruin passing game produced a big play as UCLA quarterback Ronnie Knox connected with Jim Decker with a 47-yard pass play to the Spartan 7-yard line. Three plays later, Doug Peters scored on a one-yard plunge at center. Morrall directed an 11-play, 59-yard drive to the UCLA 24, but Gerald Planutis missed a 41-yard field-goal attempt.\nFive penalties were called in the closing minutes and field position shifted in Michigan State's favor when UCLA was whistled for three-straight penalties. UCLA was called for an intentional grounding infraction which pushed the ball back to its own one-yard line; a punt gave the Spartans the ball at the UCLA 40-yard line. The Bruins were cited for interference with the kick returner on the punt play, which put the ball at the Bruin 19-yard line. Replacing Planutis as placekicker, Dave Kaiser of Michigan State converted his first career field-goal attempt, a 41-yard kick, with seven seconds remaining in the game to give the Spartans a 17–14 win.\nAftermath.\nAlthough it was UCLA penalties in the final minutes that gave field position to Michigan State, the Spartans' 98 yards given up on 10 penalties are a Rose Bowl game record as of 2008. The Spartans were named National Champions by the Boand System. Oklahoma would be named National champion by all the other organizations. In the 1956 Orange Bowl, the #1 Oklahoma Sooners defeated the #3 Maryland Terrapins 20–6 in a battle of undefeated teams. The Sugar Bowl was the last bowl game to be integrated. The Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Sugar Bowl were not integrated until 1948, 1955, and 1956 respectively."

        "text": "The WAC women's basketball tournament is the conference championship tournament in basketball for the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). The WAC has held a postseason tournament to crown a women's basketball champion every year since 1991. At first the regular season champion hosted it but at its height, the tournament was held at larger urban venues. With the departure of the Mountain West Conference teams, the tournament had returned to campus, with each game in the tournament being held in one campus venue, each year. Since 2011, the tournament has been held at the Orleans Arena, part of the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.\nThe winner of the WAC tournament is normally guaranteed a berth into the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament every year. An exception to this was in 2021, when California Baptist won the WAC tournament but was ineligible for the NCAA tournament because the school was in the midst of its transition from NCAA Division II to Division I.\nStarting with the 2023 tournament, the WAC adopted a new seeding system based on advanced team metrics, developed in large part by statistical guru Ken Pomeroy. Tournament entry will still be based on conference record.\nRecords.\nNote: 2021 champion California Baptist began a transition from NCAA Division II in 2018 and thus was not eligible for NCAA-sponsored postseason play until the 2022–23 season."

He was a utilityman who played in the majors from through for the Kansas City Royals (1991–97) and St. Louis Cardinals (1998–99). Listed at 6 feet (1.8 m) and 175 lb. (80 kg), he was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. His father, pitcher Bruce Howard, played in the big leagues during the 1960s.\nBefore heading to college, Howard attended and played baseball for Riverview High School. Howard attended the State College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota. He was able to play all infield and outfield positions, and had the ability to serve as emergency pitcher. His most productive offensive season came in 1996, when he posted career highs in games (143), runs (51), hits (92), extrabases (23) and RBI (48), while hitting a .243 batting average. On June 10, 1997, in the 5th inning of a game against the Anaheim Angels, Howard hit a long fly ball over the head of Jim Edmonds. Edmonds would make a spectacular over-the-shoulder diving catch to rob Howard of extra bases. The catch is considered one of the greatest catches in MLB history. In a nine-season career, Howard was a .229 hitter (362-for-1,583) with 11 home runs and 148 RBI in 645 total games, including 169 runs, 57 doubles, 14 triples, and 23 stolen bases.

The formation of the MWAC brought the women's sports programs of all Big Sky members under a single umbrella, and the Big Sky ultimately absorbed the MWAC in 1988, incorporating all MWAC statistics and records as its own. From the tournament's inception through the 2015 edition, each matchup was contested on the home court of the higher seed, a practice also used by the Big Sky men's tournament. The 2016 men's and women's tournaments were the first to be held at a predetermined neutral site, with both held at the Reno Events Center in Reno, Nevada.

He spent four years in Boston College, playing a total of 96 games. He turned professional in 1991, splitting the year chiefly between the Johnstown Chiefs of the ECHL and the Maine Mariners of the American Hockey League (AHL). He played 30 games for the Chiefs, scoring nine goals and assisting on 46 more, for a total of 55 points. In the AHL, he made 32 appearances, scoring six goals and assisting on 12 more, for a total of 18 points. He was recalled by the Bruins for three games. In the NHL, he scored 5 points and collected two penalty minutes.\nGlennon was returned to the Johnstown Chiefs for the 1991-92 ECHL playoffs. During a game against the Cincinnati Cyclones on March 29, 1992 at the Cambria County War Memorial Arena, Glennon and linemate Brian Ferreira were ejected for arguing separate two-line offside calls. When Ferreira was ejected, he threw a puck towards then-ECHL Commissioner Pat Kelly, took a pair of skateguards from Glennon and made an attempt to confront Kelly, apparently aiming for a microphone. Both players were originally suspended for 30 games, but upon appeal, Ferreira's suspension was reduced to 15 games, and Glennon's suspension was reduced to five games, given his minor role in the incident. Overall, Glennon played six playoff games, registering two goals and four assists, for a total of six points.\nThe following season, Glennon played only six games for the AHL's Providence Bruins, ending his affiliation with the Boston Bruins. Glennon played one more season with the Bayreuth Tigers of the German Second Bundesliga, before retiring at the conclusion of the 1993-94 season."

The usual lengths of these natural tracks are between , they must not exceed an average gradient of 13% and a maximum gradient of 25%.\nIn contrast to the artificial tracks, the cross-section of natural tracks is level - not banked in curves. This type of track leads to significantly more body movement by the athlete to navigate the turns, and the use of braking spikes on the athlete's shoes for control.\nThe natural track should have at least the following elements:\nParallel competitions (approximately ), chase races () and city races (approximately ) are held on shortened tracks.

The heavily-favored Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference defeated the Oregon Webfoots of the Pacific Coast Conference by a score \nOregon quarterback Jack Crabtree was named the Player of the Game, one of only two players in Rose Bowl history from a losing team to win the award outright.\nTeams.\nOhio State Buckeyes.\nOhio State came into the game with an eight-game winning streak, having dropped their season opener to TCU and then winning the rest of their games. They were ranked first in the Coaches' Poll and second in the AP Poll behind Auburn (on probation due to recruiting violations and was therefore not eligible for a bowl game. The Buckeyes were heavily favored to win the Rose Bowl, by up to three touchdowns.\nOregon Webfoots.\nOregon came into the Rose Bowl having just lost its Civil War rivalry game to Oregon State, which put the two teams into a tie for the Pacific Coast Conference championship. Normally, Oregon State would have gone to the Rose Bowl with the head-to-head victory; however, Oregon State had appeared in the 1957 Rose Bowl a year earlier, and the PCC had a no-repeat rule. Oregon had not been in the Rose Bowl \nGame summary.\nOhio State took the opening possession 79 yards, capped by a one-yard run by quarterback Frank Kremblas, to take a 7–0 lead. Oregon tied the game in the second quarter with a 5-yard run from Jim Shanley after an 80-yard, 10-play drive.\nThe score remained 7–7 well into the second half. With 5:20 left in the third quarter, the Webfoots had a chance to take the lead, but kicker Jack Morris' 34-yard field goal try hooked wide to the left. Early in the fourth quarter, Ohio State's Don Sutherin attempted a kick from the same spot; his kick was good, and Ohio State led by three with fourteen minutes remaining.\nOn their next possession, the Webfoots were driving until end Ron Stover fumbled inside the Ohio State thirty. With time running out in the game, Oregon got the ball back and had a chance to tie or go ahead, but Crabtree's fourth-down pass to Stover fell incomplete with 47 seconds remaining, and the Buckeyes held on to win, 10–7.\nThe Webfoots outgained the Buckeyes 351 to 304 and made 21 first downs to the Buckeyes' 19. Crabtree was 10 of 17 passing for 135 yards. Stover had 10 receptions on the day, and his 144 receiving yards established a new record for PCC participants.\nAftermath.\nThe final AP (media) and UPI (coaches) polls came out before the bowl games, so this game did nothing to change the polls. Ohio State's No. 1 ranking in the final poll earned it a share of the national championship, its third such title. Auburn retained the #1 AP ranking despite their probation status. Buckeye coach Woody Hayes was named College Football Coach of the Year.\nOregon's Jack Crabtree became one of a very few players of a losing team to win the Player of the Game award, and one of only two to win the award without sharing it with a member of the winning team. Benny Lom of California in 1929, who tackled teammate Roy Riegels (after a wrong-way run with the ball), is the only other solo Player of the Game from a losing team.\nOregon, appearing in its first Rose Bowl in 38 years, waited another 37 years to return in 1995. This was the last bowl meeting between the Buckeyes and Ducks until the 2010 Rose Bowl, which Ohio State won 26–17."

        "title": "Charles Brewer (American football)",
        "text": "Charles Brewer is a former American football player. He was the starting quarterback of the Texas Longhorns from 1953–1954. He is the father half of the only father-son combination to be starting quarterbacks at Texas. His son Robert, was the starting quarterback for the Longhorns during the 1981 and 1982 season.\nEarly life.\nA native of Lubbock, Brewer prepped at Lubbock High School where he won All-District, All-State and All-American honors. He quarterbacked the Lubbock Westerners to a 13–0 season and the 4A state championship in 1951. In 1951, he was named the Outstanding High School Football Player in Texas and then played in numerous all-star games including the Oil Bowl, the Greenbelt Bowl and the Texas High School Coaches Association All-Star Game.\nBoth of Brewer's older brothers, Bob and George, played college football as well. Bob was a quarterback at Texas Tech and George was a running back at Oklahoma, where he played with Darrell Royal. Bob left Tech after his freshman year to fight in World War II. His plane was shot down and he was captured by Nazi sympathizers and disappeared. His body was found buried in the Swiss Alps in 1948 and then returned to the United States.\nCollege Football.\nAfter earning the starting job on the Longhorns freshman team in 1952, and leading them to three late season victories, Brewer had a chance to compete for the starting job of the varsity in his sophomore year. In the 2nd game of the season, he carried the ball twice for two touchdowns and returned a punt 59 yards to set up a touchdown. After backing up John \"Bunny\" Andrews, who led the team to a 2-2 start that dropped them from #11 to unranked, Brewer was promoted to the starting role against Arkansas. Brewer then led the team to wins in 5 out of their next 6 games, including upsets of #11 SMU and #3 Baylor, and a share of the Southwest Conference Championship. He led the team that season in passing, kick-off return yards and punt return yards. Against Baylor, Brewer threw the game-winning touchdown pass and against Texas A&amp;M, perhaps Brewer's best game, Brewer set up or scored all three touchdowns. Their only loss that season with Brewer as the starter was the result of a last minute touchdown by co-champion Rice.\nBrewer remained the starter in the 1954 season, when the Longhorns started the season ranked #4, but struggled to a 4-5-1 record. Texas lost games to #1 Oklahoma, #2 Notre Dame, #12 Arkansas and #20 Baylor. It managed to tie #12 SMU, mostly thanks to the heroics of back-up quarterback Glen Dyer. Brewer ended the season with another spectacular game against Texas A&amp;M, the first for Texas in the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant era, throwing for 121 yards - his career high - and 2 touchdowns to win 22-13. The other notable game that season was against Washington State, when Carl Talmadge “Duke” Washington became the first African-American to play at Memorial Stadium.\nIn spring training in 1955, Walter Fondren outshone Brewer and eventually won the starting position for the opener. Fondren was ineffective in that game, leading coach Ed Price to rotate through his quarterbacks until Brewer, Joe Clements and Dick Miller had all taken the field with similar results, before returning to Fondren. The next week Clements replaced Fondren, had a career game and was promoted to starter for the rest of the season. Brewer played in every game that year - one of the worst in Longhorn history, on both sides of the ball and returning kickoffs, but he never regained the role of starting quarterback.\nBrewer graduated with a record of 7–4–1 as a starter and set the school record for highest gain per pass completion.\nLater life.\nHe later moved to the Dallas suburb of Richardson and started a 43-year career in banking. In 1998, Brewer was inducted into the Texas Football Hall of Fame in Waco.\nCharles' son Robert Brewer became the starting quarterback at Texas in 1981-82. Charles beat Bear Bryant's first two Texas A&amp;M teams in 1954 and 1955 and Robert beat Bryant's second-to-last Alabama Team in 1982, perhaps the only father-son duo to go 3-0 versus Bryant. Brewer's grandson Michael Brewer was the starting quarterback at Virginia Tech in 2014 and 2015 and his grandson Charlie was previously the starting quarterback at Baylor, transferred to Utah, and then to Liberty, before going to the CFL."

        "text": "Rosedale Golf Club is a private golf club in Toronto, founded in 1893 in Moore Park. The course hosted the Canadian Open in 1912 and 1928.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1893 in Moore Park as a 9-hole course and moved to Rosedale, Toronto in 1895–1896 on what is now Rosedale Field. It was an eighteen hole course on 15 acres/ This location was short-lived as the land was owned by The Scottish Ontario and Manitoba Land Company (founded by William Bain Scarth in 1879) and the area was being acquired to become a residential development called North Rosedale. In 1909, the course moved north along the Don River to its current site between the neighbourhoods of Teddington Park to the west, Lawrence Park to the south, The Bridle Path to the east and Hoggs Hollow to the north.\nControversy.\nMembers of the Toronto Jewish community bought land and established the Oakdale Golf &amp; Country Club in 1926 in response to antisemitism in Canada that strictly excluded Jews from private golf clubs, including the Rosedale Golf Club. \nIn 2004, the club was sued by McDonald's Canada chairman and CEO George Cohon, who alleged that the club rejected his membership application due to his Jewish heritage. In response, the club eventually officially discontinued its policy of not admitting Jewish members, and admitted Cohon to the club. Cohon became the club's first Jewish member in its 111 year history. In 2004, a former general manager of the golf club was awarded $370,000 by an Ontario judge as compensation for being fired in 1997 after he tried to change the club's no-Jews policy.\nTournaments.\nThe club has hosted several tournaments including the Canadian Open in 1912 and 1928. In more recent years, the club has elected to only host tournaments that cause little disruption to the membership.\nCurrent course.\nThe course plays to par 71 (73 for ladies) and is 6,525 yards in length.\nSee also.\nOther clubs in Toronto:"

In total, 13 teams participated in the qualifying tournament, as in 2007, with 12 of the teams being the same (Guam competed in 2007, but were replaced by Pakistan in the 2011 qualification process).\nRound 1.\nDue to the nature of the qualifying process, 2008 was the only year that a Division Two nation could continue in the process to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Since the winner of the 2010 Asian Five Nations will be Asia's representative, there would not be enough time for any team competing in or below Division Two after 2008 to reach the top division in time, rendering them effectively eliminated. The tournament was played in June 2008 in Bangkok, Thailand and was won by the hosts who were promoted, thus continuing their qualification hopes. The last place team from Division One was to face relegation to Division Two for 2009, effectively eliminating them from qualification as well. China was unable to compete in Division One due to visa complications and they were relegated to Division Two, last placed Sri Lanka stayed up.\nRound 2.\nDue to the nature of the qualifying process, 2009 was the last chance that a Division One nation could continue in the process to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

After graduating from Colgate University in 2008, Winchester turned professional, signing with the Ottawa Senators. He also played professional ice hockey with Jokerit of Finland and the Florida Panthers during his career, which lasted from 2008 to 2014.\nPlaying career.\nWinchester was born in Long Sault, Ontario. He played junior hockey with the Cornwall Colts of the Central Junior A Hockey League, and was then offered a full hockey scholarship, and he subsequently played four seasons of NCAA Division I hockey with Colgate University. He was an ECAC All-Star in 2007–08 as well as Colgate's team captain. On March 25, 2008, after graduating from Colgate, Winchester signed with the NHL's Ottawa Senators and began his pro career.\nWinchester made his NHL debut with Ottawa in the 2007–08 season, playing in a single game against the Boston Bruins on March 29, 2008, registering no points and two penalty minutes. Due to stipulations in the league's collective bargaining agreement, Winchester was ineligible to play in the 2008 NHL playoffs. He then made the Senators lineup out of training camp in 2008–09, though a recurring shoulder injury hampered Winchester throughout his rookie NHL season.\nWinchester re-signed with the Senators on July 3, 2010, to a two-year deal. In the 2011–12 season, Winchester suffered a serious concussion injury in late December 2011 after a hit from Buffalo’s Paul Gaustad which sidelined him for most of the season. He finally returned to the Ottawa lineup on April 1, 2012, coincidentally the same game in which the Senators clinched a playoff spot.\nWith the 2012 NHL lockout affecting his status as a free agent, Winchester signed a lockout contract with TuTo of the Finnish Mestis on November 13, 2012. After scoring 10 points in 11 games and with limited NHL interest, Winchester opted to remain in Finland and was elevated to the SM-liiga club, Jokerit for the remainder of the 2012–13 season on January 27, 2013.\nOn July 5, 2013, Winchester marked his return to the NHL in signing a one-year contract with the Florida Panthers. In the 2013–14 season, Winchester made an impression on as a defensive forward who killed penalties for the Panthers. He also contributed offensively to post a career high 9 goals and 18 points in 52 games.\nOn July 1, 2014, Winchester was signed as a free agent to a two-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche. In the 2014–15 pre-season, Winchester suffered a concussion after a hit from Dennis Wideman of the Calgary Flames. Although initially optimistic on recovery, Winchester's symptoms persisted until he was cleared to travel with the team on March 27, 2015. Winchester suffered a setback after training with the club, and was effectively ruled out from the remainder of the season preventing him from making his Avalanche debut.\nIn the lead up to the 2015–16 season, Winchester was cleared in full to participate in the Avalanche's training camp. However upon resumption of full training, Winchester's concussion symptoms flared up prior to pre-season games and he was again placed on the injury reserve, ruled out indefinitely. By November, Winchester had left the team and returned home to continue his recovery effectively marking the end of his tenure without ever appearing with the Avalanche."

The position's name comes from their duty of standing the furthest back in defence, behind the forwards (8-13), half backs (6 and 7) and the three-quarter backs (2-5). Fullbacks are therefore the last line of defence, having to tackle any opposition players and regather the ball from any kicks that make it through their teammates. It is for this reason that the fullback is also referred to as the sweeper or custodian. Being able to secure high bomb kicks is a highly sought quality in fullbacks.\nFullback is also one of the most important positions in attack, handling the ball nearly every set of six and often running into open space on the field. Therefore, together with the two half backs and hooker, fullback is one of the four key positions that make up what is referred to as a team's 'spine'. Because the fullback makes the most support runs, players in the fullback role complete more very high-intensity running than any other position.\nThe Rugby League International Federation's Laws of the Game state that the 'fullback' is to be numbered 1. However, traditionally players' jersey numbers have varied, and in the modern Super League, each squad's players are assigned individual numbers regardless of position.\nNotable fullbacks.\nFullbacks who feature in their respective nations' rugby league halls of fame are France's Puig Aubert, Australia's Clive Churchill and Charles Fraser, Wales' Jim Sullivan and New Zealand's Des White. Churchill's and Darren Lockyer's attacking flair as players are credited with having changed the role of the fullback."

        "text": "Robert Murphy (born April 7, 1969) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. Murphy played parts of seven seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1987 and 1994 with the Vancouver Canucks, Ottawa Senators, and Los Angeles Kings. Selected by the Canucks in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, Murphy turned professional in 1988 and spent the next five seasons playing for the Canucks and their minor International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate. He followed that by stints with the Senators and Kings, going between the NHL and IHL until moving to the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany in 1997, playing the last six years of his career there.\nPlaying career.\nMurphy played his junior hockey for the Laval Titan of the QMJHL, and was the top pick of the Vancouver Canucks (24th overall) in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. A strapping 6'3\" center with toughness and a decent scoring touch, Murphy was held in very high regard by Canuck management who felt he could be the team's answer to Joel Otto, the star defensive center for the rival Calgary Flames. Murphy made his NHL debut at the age of just 18 in the 1987–88 campaign, appearing in 5 games for the Canucks, and appeared in 8 more contests the following year while still playing junior. In 1989, he was selected to represent Canada at the World Junior Championships, where the team finished 4th.\nIn 1989–90, Murphy was named the IHL Rookie of the Year after scoring 71 points in 64 games for the Milwaukee Admirals, and scored his first NHL goal in a 12-game stint in Vancouver. The following season, he appeared in 42 games for the Canucks, notching 5 goals and an assist for 6 points. However, by this point the club was becoming frustrated with his slow development. In 1991–92, Murphy found himself back in the minors full-time, appearing in only 6 games for Vancouver.\nExposed in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft, Murphy was claimed by the Ottawa Senators. As a member of the inaugural Senators squad, he set career highs by appearing in 44 games and recording 10 points, but again could not establish himself as an NHL regular. Released by Ottawa, he signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Kings, where he would play his final 8 NHL games in the 1993–94 season.\nAfter leaving the Los Angeles organization, Murphy spent two seasons with the Fort Wayne Komets of the IHL before moving to Germany in 1997 to sign for SB Rosenheim of the DEL. He would spend six seasons in Germany, the last three with the Hannover Scorpions, before retiring in 2003.\nIn his career, Murphy appeared in 125 NHL games, recording 9 goals and 12 assists for 21 points, along with 152 penalty minutes.\nAfter his playing career was over, Murphy was employed as a professional ice hockey scout beginning in 2007, and served as chief pro hockey scout for the Senators until April 2024."

        "title": "United States v. International Boxing Club of New York, Inc.",
        "text": "United States v. International Boxing Club of New York, 348 U.S. 236 (1955), often referred to as International Boxing Club or just International Boxing, was an antitrust decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. By a 7–2 margin, the justices ruled that the exemption it had previously upheld for Major League Baseball was peculiar and unique to that sport and that it did not apply to boxing. Since it met the definition of interstate commerce, the government could therefore proceed with a trial to prove IBCNY and the other defendants had conspired to monopolize the market for championship boxing in the United States.\nIt was the first time another sport had argued it was covered by the same exemption as baseball by virtue of being a professional sport. Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for the majority, admitted that it would never have reached the Court but for the baseball exemption, and dissenting justices Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton were unsparing in their criticism of the arbitrary nature of this distinction.\nThe case was remanded for trial, which the government won, forcing the breakup of some of the defendant companies. An appeal of that decision also was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court four years later, upholding the wide discretion and scope of district court judges in shaping remedies for antitrust violations.\nBackground of the case.\nIn January 1949 James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz, who controlled boxing at several major arenas including Madison Square Garden, Chicago Stadium and Detroit Olympia through the International Boxing Club of New York, paid the recently retired Joe Louis $100,000 for four fighters he managed. They agreed that those fighters would fight it out among themselves for the new heavyweight title, and in return fight only in matches Norris and Wirtz promoted for several years.\nThis gave them an effective monopoly on all major boxing matches save those in the flyweight and bantamweight divisions. From 1949 to 1955 all but two championship fights took place under their control. They also secured exclusive television contracts for twice-weekly fights at the Garden, at a time when boxing was increasingly coming to depend on television revenues.\nTrial and appeal.\nThe Justice Department began investigating for possible antitrust violations and brought the IBCNY to trial in the Southern District of New York under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1953. Before it started, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, citing the Court's recent decision in \"Toolson v. New York Yankees\" () to uphold the antitrust exemption granted Major League Baseball in 1922's \"Federal Baseball Club v. National League\" (). Like baseball, they reasoned, the interstate travel required to facilitate boxing was incidental to the staging of fights and thus boxing was not subject to antitrust law as it was not interstate commerce.\nThe district court granted the motion. Immediately afterward, the government appealed the dismissal directly to the Supreme Court under the Expediting Act.\nDecision.\nChief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the majority. Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton dissented, with Minton signing Frankfurter's opinion as well.\nMajority.\n\"The question is perhaps a novel one in that this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business\", Warren wrote. \"Yet, if it were not for \"Federal Baseball\" and \"Toolson\", we think that it would be too clear for dispute that the Government's allegations bring the defendants within the scope of the Act.\" Boxing clearly involved interstate arrangements, he said, particularly with broadcasting involved, and as early as \"Hart v. B.F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange\" () the Court had been clear that baseball's antitrust exemption could not be claimed by any other business.\nPrior to the Court's consideration of \"Toolson\", he recalled, Congress had considered and rejected other bills intended specifically to genericize the baseball exemption. \"The issue confronting us is therefore not whether a previously granted exemption should continue,\" he concluded, \"but whether an exemption should be granted in the first instance. And that issue is for Congress to resolve, not this Court.\"\nDissents.\n\"It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions, whether boxing or football or tennis, and baseball\", Frankfurter began. The \"Toolson\" majority, which he had been part of, had applied \"stare decisis\", the legal doctrine under which flawed decisions can be upheld as the lesser of two evils. But here he found his colleagues irrational and inconsistent.\nMinton, too, saw flawed logic. Unlike Frankfurter, he believed that boxing generally did not constitute interstate commerce, noting that the broadcasters and sponsors had not been named as defendants by the government, and that the Court was turning \"Federal Baseball\"s conclusion on its head.\nHe conceded that Louis had a monopoly on the championship when he retired and gave the defendants exclusives on the four fighters' championship contests, but from competition in the ring, not the marketplace. \"As I see it, boxing is not trade or commerce. There can be no monopoly or restraint of nonexistent commerce or trade\", he concluded.\nLegacy.\nThe antitrust suit proceeded and the government won. The IBCNY appealed the divestitures proposed by the judge as having gone past the original offense, and that case came to the Supreme Court again as \"International Boxing Club of New York v. United States\" (). Again the justices ruled in the government's favor, and Norris and Wirtz dissolved the organization and sold their interest in the other defendant organizations.\nWhile they left boxing, they remained involved in professional sports as owners of the Chicago Blackhawks National Hockey League franchise. Wirtz's grandson Rocky is today the team's principal owner."

        "title": "Slindon Cricket Club",
        "text": "Slindon Cricket Club was famous in the middle part of the 18th century when it claimed to have the best team in England. It was located at Slindon, a village in the Arun district of Sussex.\nCricket in the 18th century was funded by gambling interests and some of the wealthier gamblers, acting as patrons, formed whole teams that were representative of several parishes and even of counties. Such a team was \"poor little Slyndon (\"sic\") against almost your whole county of Surrey\". That quote is taken from a letter written by Slindon's patron, Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond (1701 - 1750) in the 1741 English cricket season. Playing at Merrow Down near Guildford on 1 September, Slindon had just beaten Surrey \"almost in one innings\".\nThe Duke of Richmond was the greatest of the sport's early patrons and he did an enormous service to the development of the sport in his native Sussex. He had been active as a player and patron since the 1720s and he lent his benevolence to the little woodland club near Arundel in the late 1730s when he became aware that its residents included three talented brothers, one of whom was showing signs of greatness, and a number of other decent players.\nThe brothers were the Newlands, among whom Richard was outstanding. Richard Newland (1718 - 29 May 1791), an all-rounder who batted left-handed, became one of the greatest early cricketers and was famous throughout the 1740s. His brothers, about whom little is known, were Adam (born 1714) and John (born 1717). Another good player in the village, although he was an unsavoury one, was the notorious smuggler \"Cuddy\" whose real name was Edward Aburrow senior. Senior because his son became a regular in the Hambledon team of the 1770s.\nIt is almost certain that Slindon was not just a village team and that it was in fact a Sussex county team, just as Dartford Cricket Club had always formed the nucleus of the Kent team. There can be little doubt that Richmond cast his net wide and that players from elsewhere in Sussex played for Slindon. But Richard Newland was the star and he was definitely local. It seems that Richmond built the team around Newland and so it was perhaps natural that the name of the team, even if it were a Sussex county XI, should be that of Newland's village.\n1741 season.\nThe first written record of the Slindon team is on 15 June 1741 when they played against Portsmouth at Stansted Park, Rowlands Castle, near Havant in Hampshire. Slindon won this match by 9 wickets. It is the earliest report of a match involving Slindon, though the club must have been playing for some time beforehand. The Duke of Richmond in a letter said that \"above 5000 people\" were present. In a second letter, he gives the result.\nOn Thursday 9 July 1741, in a letter to her husband, the Duchess of Richmond (1706 - 1751) mentioned a conversation with John Newland re a Slindon v East Dean match at Long Down, near Eartham, a week earlier. This seems to be the first recorded mention of any of the Newland family.\nIn two subsequent letters to his friend the Duke of Newcastle, a future Prime Minister, Richmond spoke about a game on Tuesday 28 July which resulted in a brawl with \"hearty blows and broken heads\". The game was at Portslade between Slindon and unnamed opponents. Slindon won the battle but the result of the match is unknown. Richmond had been involved in ruckuses of this sort before and Georgian England was an essentially violent society. It was normal in cricket for the rough to rub shoulders with the smooth.\nThe \"poor little Slyndon\" phrase followed the game against Surrey at Merrow Down on 7 September 1741. Richmond in a letter to Newcastle before the game spoke of \"poor little Slyndon against almost your whole county of Surrey\". Next day he wrote again, saying that \"wee (\"sic\") have beat Surrey almost in one innings\".\nSoon afterwards, Richmond's wife Sarah, a feisty character in her own right, wrote to him and said she \"wish’d... that the Sussex mobb (\"sic\") had thrash’d the Surrey mob\". She had \"a grudge to those fellows ever since they mob’d you\" (apparently a reference to the Richmond Green fiasco in August of the 1731 English cricket season). She then said she wished the Duke \"had won more of their moneys\".\n1742 season.\nThe fame of Slindon and the Newlands was established after this beating of Surrey. In August 1742, the report of a London v Croydon game at the Artillery Ground says that \"the noted bowler from Slendon (\"sic\") assisted Croydon\". This was probably Richard Newland although he was a genuine all-rounder, not just a bowler.\nIn September, the Slindon team came to the Artillery Ground for probably the first time. London Cricket Club was pre-eminent in the game at that time and had dominated the 1730s. In the two matches on 6 and 10 September, London prevailed. They won the first game \"with great difficulty\" and then, apparently having been assisted by the weather which made the pitch unplayable, they won the second by 184 runs.\nThe enthusiasm generated by these matches cannot be overstated. Massive crowds attended and fortunes were gambled on the results and on individual performances. A report states that Slindon came to the Artillery Ground \"having played 43 games and lost but one\". Richard Newland was heavily backed to score 40 runs off his own bat – a feat he failed to accomplish. Pitch conditions in those days heavily favoured the bowlers and to score 40 then would be like making a century on a modern \"flat track\".\nA report states: \"At the conclusion of the above (i.e., second) match Slindon offered to play another match against London either at Guildford or on the South Downs for £100, but the challenge was not accepted\".\n1743 season.\nAll quiet on the Slindon front in 1743 which saw the rise of Addington Cricket Club. Unlike Slindon, Addington beat London by an innings. Slindon, it seems, went away to lick its wounds. The only notable mentions of Slindon in 1743 are of Richard Newland personally for he established his reputation as an outstanding single wicket performer.\n1744 season.\nThe year of the famous \"Slindon Challenge\".\nMonday 23 April marked the death of Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet (1695 – 1744) who was one of the greatest of cricket's early patrons, especially in his native Sussex, though it is not actually known if he was involved with Slindon. He always enjoyed a friendly rivalry with Richmond and it is possible he did share in Slindon's fortunes.\nThe London \"Daily Advertiser\" carried various notices from Thursday 31 May until Sunday 3 June which announced that two untitled sides would play in the Artillery Ground on Saturday 2 June. On 31 May, the paper said that the teams would consist of \"four gentlemen from Slindon, one from Eastbourne, two from Hamilton (\"sic\") in Sussex, one from Addington and three from Lingfield in Surrey\" against \"four gentlemen of London, one from Richmond, one from Reigate, three from Addington in Surrey, one from Bray Wick in Berkshire and one from Arundel in Sussex\". This was followed by the usual reminder about no dogs and the need to obtain a pass ticket if leaving the ground during play.\nThe \"Daily Advertiser\" changed its notice on Friday 1 June through 2 and 3 June by confusingly announcing the names of the players on each side. However, the names in the paper are not the same as those on the earliest known cricket scorecard kept by the Duke of Richmond. The same (i.e., incorrect) names were also reported on 3 June, the day after the match. The paper announced that the two teams would consist of: Cuddy (i.e., Edward Aburrow senior), Richard Newland, Adam Newland, John Newland, Ridgeway, Green (all of Sussex); William Sawyer, Stevens, Stevens, Collins (all of Surrey); and Norris of London versus Stephen Dingate, John Harris, Joseph Harris, Tom Faulkner, George Jackson, Maynard (all of Surrey); ? Bryant (Bromley), George Smith, ? Bennett, Howlett (all of London); and the famous all-rounder Thomas Waymark, now of Berkshire. No titles were given to the teams.\nAccording to the Duke of Richmond's papers, which are now in the possession of the West Sussex Records Office, including the recorded scores of this match, the teams were somewhat different from those advertised. The scorecard is currently the earliest known in which individual and team scores are recorded but it lacks details of dismissal.\nSlindon: Edward Aburrow (\"aka\" Cuddy), ? Bryant, Richard Newland, Adam Newland, – Ridgeway, Joseph Harris, George Jackson, John Harris, – Norris, – Andrews, George Smith.\nLondon: – Howlett, Stephen Dingate, William Sawyer, – Maynard, ? Bennett, Tom Faulkner, Thomas Waymark, – Butler, – Green, – Hodder, – Collins.\nBoth the Harris brothers, John and Joseph, were involved; and of the three Newland brothers it was John who did not play.\nThomas Waymark was formerly employed by the Duke of Richmond but he is here given as a Berkshire resident and playing for the London XI.\nThe match included a declaration by the Slindon team in their second innings at 102–6. They made 102 &amp; 102–6d against London's scores of 79 &amp; 70. Slindon won by 55 runs.\nIn September, Slindon again played London at the Artillery Ground and won, but details including the margin of victory have not survived. Having now defeated London twice, Slindon felt emboldened enough to issue a challenge whereby it would play \"any parish in England\". London did not accept. Only Addington Cricket Club and Bromley Cricket Club were able to accept.\nMatches against both these clubs were arranged at the Artillery Ground: against Addington on 12 and 13 September; and against Bromley on 14 September. It is known that rain intervened and no result or match report has survived of either game, even though they are known to have created huge interest. The only conclusion is that they were rained off.\n1745 to 1749.\nThe single wicket form of the game became increasingly popular in the latter half of the 1740s and Richard Newland was often involved but little is recorded of Slindon after its heroics in 1744.\nOn 5 July 1745, there was a match at the Artillery Ground between two \"best elevens\", apparently organised by Robert Colchin and Richard Newland, which was advertised rather wordily as Sevenoaks, Bromley &amp; Addington \"versus\" Slindon, Horsmonden, Chislehurst &amp; London!\nIn the 1747 season, Slindon issued challenges in the highly popular (and lucrative) \"fives\" version of single wicket.\nOn Monday 6 July 1747, Five of Slindon played Five of Dartford at the Artillery Ground. This was the result of a challenge by Slindon, published in the \"Daily Advertiser\" on Mon 29 June, to play \"five of any parish in England, for their own Sum\". The announcement advised interested parties: \"If it is accepted of by any, they are desir’d to go to Mr Smith, who has Orders to make Stakes for them\". The three Newland brothers all played. \"Mr Smith\" was George Smith, keeper of the Artillery Ground. On Saturday 4 July, George Smith announced in the same paper that \"five of Dartford in Kent, have made Stakes with him, and will play with the above Gentlemen at the Time and Place above mentioned for twenty Pounds\".\nSubsequently, more five-a-side challenges took place on Wednesday 8 July against Bromley and then two matches on 10 July and 15 July against the strong Hadlow team from Kent.\nDeath of the Duke of Richmond.\nThe Duke of Richmond died on Wednesday 8 August 1750 and it could be said that Slindon died with him, especially as the Newlands were by now veteran players with their best years behind them. Richmond's death, following that of his friend Sir William Gage in 1744, had a massive impact on the game in Sussex and the game as a whole was affected only a few months later when the Prince of Wales, another key patron, also died.\nAn immediate slump ensued from this loss of patronage and then cricket was badly affected by the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763.\n\"Poor little Slyndon\".\nThe last mention of Slindon, now in reality \"poor little Slyndon\", was in a match on 21 and 22 June 1754 against Midhurst &amp; Petworth on Bowling Green, Lavington Common. This was clearly a village match only. Slindon apparently lost by eight wickets and the match seems to mark the great little club's swansong for it was not mentioned in the sources thereafter. Sussex cricket as a whole went into decline and, although a number of inter-parish games were reported over the next decade or so, it was not until 1766 that a Sussex team again appeared in important matches.\nReferences to the Hambledon Club, particularly those in the works of G B Buckley, strongly suggest that Hambledon was the organiser of matches played not just by a Hampshire county team but by a combined Hampshire-Sussex team. A number of Sussex cricketers are known to have played for Hambledon during its glory days: one of them being Edward \"Curry\" Aburrow, son of the notorious Slindon smuggler; and another being none other than the club captain Richard Nyren, who was born in Sussex and was the nephew of the three Newland brothers."

        "title": "Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "The tennis tournaments at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were staged at the All England Club in Wimbledon, from 28 July to 5 August. This was the first Olympic grass court tournament since tennis was reintroduced as an Olympic sport and the first to be held at a Grand Slam venue in the Open era. Two other 2012 Summer Olympic bid finalists had also offered Grand Slam venues. Second-place finisher Paris offered the French Open venue, the Stade Roland Garros, which later was also included in their successful 2024 bid. Meanwhile, fourth-place finisher New York City offered the US Open venue, the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens.\nA total of 190 players competed in five events: singles and doubles for both men and women and, for the first time since 1924, mixed doubles were officially included. The Olympic tennis events were run and organised by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and were part of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tours. As a side effect, the regular rule imposed by the All England Club during The Championships calling for all-white player clothing was waived to allow players to wear Olympic national team clothing, and London 2012 bunting also mixed with the traditional Wimbledon green.\nElena Dementieva and Rafael Nadal were the reigning champions, neither of whom defended their titles. Dementieva had retired from professional tennis in 2010, while Nadal withdrew due to tendinitis.\nSummary.\nIn the women's singles tournament, Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova while losing only one game in the final for the gold medal and her sixth major event win at Wimbledon, having won the ladies' singles tournament at The Championships less than three weeks earlier as well as in 2002, 2003, 2009 and 2010. She also defended her women's doubles title alongside her sister Venus Williams, who had won singles gold in Sydney in 2000. With her singles gold, she became the second female player to win a career singles Golden Slam—Olympic gold in addition to the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, with the first being Steffi Graf in 1988 after she won all five events that year (a feat not yet matched by another player, male or female.) Williams also became the first player in history, male or female, to win the career Golden Grand Slam in both singles and doubles (the Williams sisters had already completed their career doubles Golden Grand Slam at the 2001 Australian Open, joining Pam Shriver in Seoul in 1988 and Gigi Fernández at the 1993 Australian Open.) Furthermore, the Williams sisters also became the first four-time gold medalists in Olympic tennis history.\nIn the men's singles tournament final, Andy Murray beat Roger Federer in straight sets in front of a home crowd to avenge his four-set loss against Federer exactly four weeks earlier on Centre Court in the Wimbledon gentlemen's singles final. In doing so, he denied Federer the chance to become the third man to win a career singles Golden Grand Slam after Nadal at the 2010 US Open and Andre Agassi at the 1999 French Open. He also became the first British man to win singles tennis gold since Josiah Ritchie in 1908 (also at Wimbledon) and the first to win a major event at Wimbledon since Fred Perry won The Championships in 1936. Based on his gold medal as well as his achievements over the following four years, including a US Open championship, two Wimbledon championships and a Davis Cup, Team GB chose him as their flagbearer for the opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, where he won a second consecutive gold medal.\nMeanwhile, the Bryan brothers (Mike and Bob) took the men's doubles gold for the United States and themselves completed a career Golden Grand Slam, joining the Australian \"Woodies\" (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, who completed their set at the 2000 French Open) and Canada's Daniel Nestor at Wimbledon in 2009. Also, the Belarusian top seeds of Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi took the mixed doubles gold after overcoming Murray and Laura Robson mere hours after Murray had defeated Federer.\nTournament.\n The 2012 Olympic tournament was the fourteenth edition of tennis at the Olympics (excluding the two Olympics, 1968 and 1984, when tennis was a demonstration event), and the seventh since 1988, when tennis was officially brought back into the Olympic Games. Mixed doubles was an official Olympic event for the first time since 1924, when Hazel Wightman and Richard Williams of the United States won the gold medal, and was played for the first time since it was played as a demonstration event in 1968. \nThe 2012 tournaments were played on grass courts at the All England Club, three weeks after the end of the 2012 edition of The Championships. Sessions ran from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m. as established by the All England Club policy. However, the All England Club along with other organizers not only allowed but encouraged the players to wear their national colours as opposed to predominantly white clothes in accordance with typical Wimbledon tradition, and the normally all-green grounds were also decked out in purple and multi-coloured London 2012 Olympic branding.\nTwelve courts were used for the matches including Centre Court, No.1 and No.2. No.3 Court was used for warm ups. The Olympic tennis events were organised jointly by the ITF, the IOC and the All England Club. Both the men's and women's singles and doubles events counted as a part of the 2012 ATP World Tour and the 2012 WTA Tour.\nPoints distribution.\nThe points distribution for the Association of Tennis Professionals and the Women's Tennis Association tours, concerning only singles competition on the 2012 Olympic Games, is listed below. These points can be added to a player's world ranking for the 2012 season. \nQualification.\nFor the singles competitions, the top 56 players in the world rankings on 11 June 2012 of the WTA and ATP tours qualified for the Olympics. However, entry was limited to four players from a country. This means that players who were ranked in the top 56 but are from countries with four higher-ranked players already participating did not qualify, and players who were ranked outside of the top 56 but are from countries with fewer than four players already participating qualified. A player could only participate if he or she had made him- or herself available to be drafted to represent the player's country in Davis Cup or Fed Cup for two of the following years: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, with one of the years being either 2011 or 2012. Of the other eight wildcard slots, six of the slots were determined by the ITF's Olympic Committee, taking into account ranking and spread of nations represented, while the final two slots were awarded by the IOC to players from small nations.\nIn the doubles competitions, twenty four teams automatically qualified as per the rankings on 11 June 2012, subject to a maximum of two teams per nation. Players in the top ten of the doubles rankings could reserve a place, provided they had a partner to compete with. The remaining eight teams were decided by the ITF's Olympic Committee. Entries for the mixed doubles were confirmed at the Games. The Tripartite Commission later decided only to give places in the women's singles leaving eight wildcards to be chosen by the \nITF Olympic Committee for the men's singles competition.\nCompetition of Olympics.\nFormat.\nThe tennis competition at the Olympic Games consists of a single elimination tournament. The size of the singles draw, 64, means that there are six rounds of competition in total, with five in the doubles owing to its smaller draw size of 32, and 4 for mixed with its draw size only being 16. Players reaching the semifinal are assured of an opportunity to compete for a medal, as the two losing parties in each semifinals contest a bronze medal match.\nIn a further change from normal Wimbledon practice, the matches followed the Olympic format – all matches were three-set matches except for the men's singles final, which would be a five-set match. The tie break operated in every set except the fifth set in the men's singles final and the third set in the other matches (except mixed doubles), when an advantage set was played. In the mixed doubles the third set was played as a match tie-break (10 points).\nWild card entries.\nMen's singles wild card entries.\nThe following players received an ITF Invitation:\nWomen's singles wild card entries.\nThe following players received an ITF Invitation:\nThe following players received a Tripartite Commission Invitation:\nMen's doubles wild card entries.\nThe following players received an ITF Invitation:\nWomen's doubles wild card entries.\nThe following players received an ITF Invitation:\nMixed doubles wild card entries.\nThe following players received an ITF Invitation:\nSingles seeds.\nSeedings were based on the rankings as of 23 July 2012."

It competed in domestic first-class, List A and T20 cricket tournaments, namely the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Pakistan Cup and National T20 Cup. The team was operated by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cricket Association.\nHistory.\nBefore 2019.\nAs the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), the team played its inaugural season in the Ranji Trophy in 1937. After the independence of Pakistan, NWFP competed in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy sporadically from 1953–54 to 1978–79, and in the Pentangular Cup and Pakistan Cup. In 2010, the province was renamed \"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\" and the team name changed accordingly. The team used Peshawar Club Ground as a home ground since 1938 until it was replaced by Arbab Niaz Stadium in 1985.\nSince 2019.\nA new Khyber Pakhtunkhwa team was introduced as a part of the new domestic structure announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on 31 August 2019.\nStructure.\nIn 2019, domestic cricket in Pakistan was reorganised into six regional teams (on provincial lines).

        "title": "Sam Young (basketball)",
        "text": "Samuel David Young (born June 1, 1985) is an American/Lebanese former professional basketball player for Homenetmen Beirut of the Lebanese Basketball League and the Lebanese National Basketball Team. He played college basketball at the University of Pittsburgh.\nEarly years.\nThe eldest of five children, Young was born in Washington, D.C. to single mother Marquet Craig, then 14 years old. She supported her family by working as a cable TV installer for Comcast, and moved the family nine times. By the time Young was in high school, the family had found its way to Prince George's County, Maryland. At Friendly High School in Fort Washington, Young led the Patriots to Maryland state titles in 2003 and 2004, averaging 24.6 points, 14.0 rebounds, and six blocked shots per game as a senior.\nAfter graduating from high school, Young attended Hargrave Military Academy for a year as his high school grades meant that he would have to spend a year at a prep school in order to qualify for a scholarship. He averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds for a team that went 28–1 and was ranked second nationally among prep school programs. The basketball recruiting site \"Scout.com\" named Young its National Prep School Player of the Year for 2005. He also received the recruiting attention he had largely missed out on in high school, receiving offers from programs such as Georgia, Maryland, Georgetown, Virginia Tech, and Miami. He would decide to sign with Pitt; Joe Lombardi, then a Pitt assistant and now head coach at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, speculated that Young chose Pitt because \"[w]e were there when a whole lot of other people weren't around. He just wanted someone to give him some love.\"\nConsidered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Young was listed as the No. 17 small forward and the No. 71 player in the nation in 2005.\nCollege career.\nYoung joined the Pitt basketball team for the 2005–2006 season. He initially chafed at his role on the team; he wanted to display his perimeter skills, but head coach Jamie Dixon wanted him to play on the inside. Young nearly transferred to Kansas State after his sophomore year of 2006–07, but when the Wildcats' coach Bob Huggins left for West Virginia after that season, Dixon convinced Young to stay, indicating that he would have a much bigger role on the team in the upcoming season. Dixon's prediction was borne out that season; Young averaged 18 points per game, was named the 2008 Big East tournament MVP after scoring 80 points in the tournament, and was also named the conference's most improved player.\nIn his senior season at Pitt, Young averaged 19.2 points per game, and was given the honor of being a Third Team All-America. His 2009 NBA draft stock also increased after his spectacular performance in the 2009 NCAA Tournament in which he averaged 23.5 points in four games. He also received accolades from his opposition; Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, who saw Young score 56 points in two games against his team in Young's senior season, including 31 on Pitt's 2009 Senior Day, said, \"There hasn't ever been a player who gives us as many problems as he does.\"\nThe Basketball Tournament.\nSam Young played for Team ATL AllStars in the 2018 edition of The Basketball Tournament. He had a team-high 29 points and nine rebounds in the team's first-round loss to Louisiana United.\nProfessional career.\nYoung was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies with the 36th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.\nOn March 15, 2012, Young was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the rights to Ricky Sánchez.\nOn September 6, 2012, Young signed with the Indiana Pacers. On January 6, 2013, he was waived by the Pacers but was later re-signed on January 28, 2013.\nOn September 30, 2013, Young signed with the San Antonio Spurs. However, he was later waived by the Spurs on October 10, 2013.\nOn November 18, 2013, Young signed with the Sydney Kings for the rest of the 2013–14 NBL season. On February 4, 2014, Young was named the Player of the Month for January. In 21 games for the Kings, Young averaged 21.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.0 steals per game.\nOn January 19, 2014, Young signed with Vaqueros de Bayamón of Puerto Rico for the 2014 BSN season.\nOn July 22, 2014, he signed a one-year deal with Juvecaserta Basket of Italy. On December 31, 2014, he parted ways with Juvecaserta.\nOn January 14, 2015, he signed with Mexican team Halcones de Xalapa. On April 8, he signed with Muratbey Uşak Sportif of the Turkish Basketball League.\nOn September 21, 2017, Young signed with Homenetmen Beirut of the Lebanese Basketball League.\nPersonal life.\nScott Cacciola of \"The Commercial Appeal\", the daily newspaper of the Grizzlies' home city of Memphis, Tennessee, wrote:\nYoung's work ethic borders on the obsessive. While at Pitt, he practiced so much on his own that the coaching staff worried about his knees, and he would regularly play pick-up games at lunchtime during the season. During the summer before his senior year at Pitt, he went so far as to live for a month in a locker room at Pitt's home arena, the Petersen Events Center, sleeping on an air mattress he had carried to the locker room, so he could work out and practice whenever he chose. Young himself admitted that basketball was his \"love\" and his girlfriend was his \"mistress\", adding, \"And she knows that.\"\nOne of Young's closest friends, former high school teammate and later South Florida player Chris Howard, noted that Young's work ethic was present long before he came to Pitt:\nHe also found inspiration in his family. During his year at Hargrave, he put a poster in his dorm room that read \"I can't let my mother work harder than I do.\" He also drew from his brother Michael Spriggs, who was born with cataracts and glaucoma and completely lost his sight at age 13, but nonetheless reached the state championships in high school wrestling and won a gold medal in judo at an international blind sports competition. Young said about his brother, \"It could have been me. And I know if he had my opportunities, he'd be doing something constructive with them.\"\nYoung's athleticism is not limited to basketball. Before his senior year at Friendly High, he promised to do backflips if the Patriots won the state title, and proceeded to do exactly that. He also reportedly stunned Pitt's diving coach one day by climbing up to the 7½-meter board and performing a nearly perfect 2½ somersault into the pool.\nHe also writes poetry; he has spoken with a publisher about compiling his works, and read some of his poems at an open-mic night at a Pittsburgh coffeehouse in 2008. He is also a skilled piano player."

It is less than a mile from the central undergraduate campus. It is heavily lined with trees, and includes over 140 bunkers. The facilities include the Guy Bostick Club House and a dedicated practice area for the Gators men's and women's golf teams. The course is named for Mark Bostick – President of Comcar Industries and a generous donor to the Florida Gators athletics program.\nThe course was formerly the home of the Gainesville Country Club, and was acquired by the university in 1963. Noted Scottish golfer and golf course architect Donald Ross designed the course in 1921, when it was originally owned and operated by the country club. In 2001, golf course architect Bobby Weed renovated the facility, with $4 million in private donations. As part of the renovation, the course length was stretched by 500 yards, to a total length just over 6,700 yards, and re-rated as a par 70. MacCurrach Golf Construction, Inc. was the primary construction contractor. When completed in November 2001, the University Athletic Association celebrated the occasion with \"Gator Golf Day,\" an alumni golf event that included former Gator golf greats.\nThe Mark Bostick Golf Course hosts the annual Gator Invitational and Lady Gator Invitational tournaments, as well as the annual Gator Golf Day alumni event. The course has also served as the site for the NCAA Regional tournament on several occasions, including 2009. The club house has served a faculty club meeting place, and a venue for student organization events.\nUniversity of Florida students, faculty, staff and alumni may play the course. Tee times may be scheduled in advance, Friday through Sunday.\nScorecard.\nThe par and yardage shown are from the orange tees, which may be played only with permission from the course management.

        "text": "The Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team represents the University of Oklahoma in men's NCAA Division I basketball. The Sooners play in the Big 12 Conference. Although they have spent most of their existence in the shadow of the football program, the Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball program has had significant success over the last several decades. The team has participated in five Final Fours, and holds the record for most NCAA tournament wins without a championship. As of the 2022 season, they are tied for 12th all-time in NCAA tournament appearances. In addition to their tournament successes the program has produced several 33 All-Americans including Wayman Tisdale, Stacey King, Harvey Grant, Mookie Blaylock, Ryan Minor, Hollis Price, and Blake Griffin, 9 first round draft picks, including one No. 1 pick (Blake Griffin) and four National Players of the Year: Vic Holt (1928), Gerald Tucker (1947), Blake Griffin (2009) and Buddy Hield (2016).\nHistory.\n1908–80.\nThe Sooners enjoyed moderate success on the court during this era, posting just 16 losing records in their first 72 seasons. They were led by 9 different coaches during this period, beginning with Bennie Owen (who also coached the football team) and ending with Dave Bliss in 1980. The Sooners participated in the very first Final Four in 1939. OU made a second appearance in the championship game in 1947, losing 47–58 to Holy Cross.\n1981–1994 (the Billy Tubbs era).\nThe program gained national prominence under Billy Tubbs when he took over in 1981. Star players Wayman Tisdale, Mookie Blaylock, and Stacey King guided the Sooners to several deep runs in the NCAA tournament. In 1988, the Sooners reached the NCAA title game in Kansas City, where they fell four points shy of their first national title to the 11-loss Kansas Jayhawks, a team which they had beaten twice in regular season play.\nTubbs resigned on April 10, 1994, indicating that \"he did not feel appreciated enough working at a football school\" (he later reconciled with the administration and enjoyed a healthy relationship with the school up until his death from leukemia in 2020). Tubbs' base salary at Oklahoma in his final season was $107,000 annually. Tubbs, 59 years old at the time, left to take over the struggling Texas Christian University basketball program, signing a 5-year contract worth between $200,000 and $400,000 per season.\nTubbs' record at OU was 333–132 (0.716) overall, 126–70 (0.643) conference, with 10 NCAA tournament appearances, one Final Four appearance, and one National Title Game appearance. Tubbs finished with 5 Big 8 regular season titles and 2 Conference tournament titles.\nTubbs averaged 24 wins per season (24–9) and 9 conference wins per season (9–5).\n1995–2006 (the Kelvin Sampson era).\nKelvin Sampson became the 11th head coach at the University of Oklahoma on April 25, 1994. Sampson was named national coach of the year in 1995 (his first year at OU) by the Associated Press, United States Basketball Writers Association and Basketball Weekly after guiding the Sooners to 23–9 overall and 15–0 home marks. It was the second-best overall record posted by a first-year coach in Big 8 history. Sampson possesses the highest winning percentage in Oklahoma history (.719). He guided OU to nine consecutive 20-win seasons. He averaged 24.4 wins over those nine campaigns. He directed the Sooners to postseason tournament berths in each of his 12 seasons (11 NCAA tournaments), with a Sweet 16 showing in 1999, a Final Four appearance in 2002 and an Elite Eight appearance in 2003. His teams also played in the Big 12 Tournament title game on five occasions during the 10 seasons he coached in the Big 12. In 2001, 2002, and 2003 the Sooners won that tournament. Sampson finished with a Big 12 Tournament record of 17–7. Standouts Eduardo Nájera and Hollis Price helped the Sooners maintain a streak of 25 straight post season appearances, the longest in the nation. Sampson left OU in 2006 to take a head job at Indiana.\nSampson's record at OU was 279–109 (0.719) overall, 128–60 (0.681) conference, with 11 NCAA tournament Appearances, including one Final Four appearance. In the Big 12, Sampson had 3 Conference tournament Titles and 1 Conference regular season Title. During his final season at OU, Sampson's salary was approximately $900,000 annually, not including bonuses. Sampson left OU in 2006 to become the head basketball coach at Indiana University, signing a 7-year, $10.5 million contract, at $1.5 million per season.\nUnder Sampson's watch, Oklahoma was placed under a three-year investigation by the NCAA for recruiting violations. At the end of their investigation, the NCAA issued a report citing more than 550 illegal calls made by Sampson and his staff to 17 different recruits. The NCAA barred Sampson from recruiting off campus and making phone calls for one year, ending May 24, 2007.\n\"Sampson averaged 23 wins per season (23–9) and 11 conference wins per season (11–5).\"\n2006–2011 (the Jeff Capel era).\nOn April 11, 2006, Jeff Capel was named the 12th head basketball coach at Oklahoma, succeeding Kelvin Sampson. Though the Sooner Nation as a whole greeted Capel's hiring with optimism, one notable downside of the coaching change emerged—Sampson's departure caused three of the players who had signed with OU (once considered a top-five recruiting class) to rethink each's decision to attend OU. Scottie Reynolds went on to Villanova, and Damion James to Texas. Capel was originally signed to a four-year, $3 million contract, at $750,000 annually.\nIn his first year, after going 8–4 in non-conference games, with losses to Memphis, Purdue, Villanova, and Alabama, the Sooners started 6–3 in conference play, before losing their final 7 conference games. After winning only one game in the Big 12 Conference tournament, losing to eventual conference tournament champion Kansas, the Sooners missed any form of postseason play, which snapped the nation's longest streak of 25 consecutive years in the postseason, starting with Billy Tubbs' second year in 1982 and ending with Kelvin Sampson's final year in 2006.\nIn his second year, after signing McDonald's All-American Forward Blake Griffin, the Sooners finished 21–10 during the regular season (9-7 in Big 12 play) earning them a No. 4 seed in the Big 12 Tournament, where they won one game before losing to Texas in the semi-finals. They received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they defeated St. Joseph's in the first round before losing to No. 3 seed Louisville in the second round, finishing the season at 23–12, an improvement of 7 wins over the previous season. After this successful second season, Capel's name began to surface among many head coaching vacancies. In an effort to keep Capel, OU Athletic Director Joe Castiglione and the OU Board of Regents extended Capel's contract through 2014, and increased his salary to $1.05 million per year.\nPlayer of the Year Candidate Blake Griffin announced he would be returning for his sophomore season, forgoing a possible lottery-pick status in the NBA draft. Coupled with the signing of another McDonald's All-American guard in Willie Warren, the 2008–2009 season looked to be promising.\nThe team experienced one of the best starts in school history at 25–1, until Griffin was sidelined with a concussion during the first half of the OU–Texas game on February 21, 2009. The Sooners went on to lose consecutive games for the first time all season, to Texas by 5 in Austin and Kansas by 9 in Norman. Without their star player, the Sooners fell short. Griffin returned to the lineup on February 28, 2009, and the Sooners returned to their winning ways defeating Texas Tech by 15 in Lubbock on 2/28/09, before losing on the road to Missouri, who was undefeated at home, and finishing the regular season by sweeping in-state rival Oklahoma State, who had won 7 of their previous 8 games. After a first-round bye in the Big 12 Tournament, the 2nd-seeded Sooners lost to the 7th-seeded Cowboys by 1 point during the final seconds of the game.\nCapel's Sooners were granted a No. 2 seed for the NCAA tournament, and easily beat No. 15 seed Morgan State in the first round, #10 seed Michigan in the second round, and #3 seed Syracuse in the Sweet 16, whose vaunted 2–3 zone defense did nothing to slow down the Sooners' hot shooting from the perimeter.\nHowever, after hitting nine three-pointers during the previous game with Syracuse, the Sooner guards went 0/15 from beyond the arc during the first 35 minutes of their Elite 8 game against North Carolina, before finishing 2–19 in the game. This ultimately led to their demise by the Tar Heels on March 29, losing 60–72. Unanimous All-American Forward and Player of the Year Blake Griffin finished the tournament with 114 points and 60 rebounds, becoming the first player to accomplish such a feat in over 40 years. Griffin, who gave up his final two years of eligibility to enter the NBA draft, and was the #1 pick. The Sooners finished Capel's third season at 34–2, the school's first 30+ win season since 2002, and 2th overall. This was again an improvement of 7 wins over the previous season.\nEven with the loss of starters Austin Johnson, Taylor Griffin, and Blake Griffin, the Sooners had two incoming McDonald's All-American recruits in point guard Tommy Mason-Griffin and center Keith \"Tiny\" Gallon. Paired with returning McDonald's All-American guard Willie Warren, guard Tony Crocker, and former reserve forward Ryan Wright, the Sooners had a chance to post yet another successful season and were poised make another deep run into the NCAA tournament. This was the first time in the school's history where they had three McDonald's All-Americans on the roster at the same time.\nDespite high hopes and a preseason ranking of No. 16, Jeff Capel and his Sooners proved to be one of the most overrated teams in the 2009–2010 season. After a mediocre 13–9 start, their season slipped away as they lost their last nine games of the season, including a first-round loss to Oklahoma State in the Big 12 tournament, leaving them with a 13–18 record to cap off the season. Those wins were vacated in November 2011 after various violations that included improper benefits and ineligible players.\nCapel's record at OU was 83–69 (0.546) overall, 33–43 (0.463) in conference (with 13 total wins and 4 conference wins having been vacated), with 2 NCAA tournament Appearances, and one Elite Eight appearance. In the Big 12, Capel did not win a Conference tournament title or regular season title.\nCapel finished 2010–11 with a 14–18 record and a loss to the Texas Longhorns in the 2011 Big 12 Tournament. On March 14, 2011, he was fired as head coach of the Sooners.\nIn November 2011, the NCAA punished Oklahoma with three years probation, a $15,000 fine, reductions in recruiting, the loss of a scholarship, and vacation of all wins for the 2009–10 season.\n2011–2021 (the Lon Kruger era).\nLon Kruger was hired by OU to replace Jeff Capel as head coach prior to the 2011–12 season. Kruger had previously coached at Kansas State, Florida, Illinois and UNLV. In his first season at helm, the Sooners finished 15–16, improving on their 2010–11 finish.\nThe 2012–13 season yielded a surprising 20–12 (11–7 Big 12, 4th) finish and resulted in the program's first NCAA tournament bid since Blake Griffin led the school to the Elite 8 in 2009. However, the Sooners were defeated in the second round of the NCAA tournament by San Diego State.\nThe 2013–14 season continued this trend of improvement, as the Sooners finished 23–10 overall (12–6 Big 12, 2nd). However, they were again upset in the second round of the NCAA tournament, falling to North Dakota State.\n4 of the 5 starters from the 2013–14 team returned for the 2014–15 season. Guard Buddy Hield was Big 12 player of the year as OU made it to the Big 12 tournament semifinals before Iowa State bounced them out. Oklahoma received a #3 seed in the East region of the NCAA tournament, made it to the Sweet Sixteen by beating little regarded Albany and Dayton, but couldn't advance to the regional final (Elite Eight) as Michigan State held on 62–58.\nIn the 2015–2016 season, Oklahoma finished 24–6 in the regular season, and despite losing to West Virginia in the Big 12 Tournament's second round, received a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament. Oklahoma easily beat Cal State Bakersfield in the first round, but struggled to finish off VCU in the second round despite an early 21–7 lead. Oklahoma then went on to defeat Texas A&amp;M 77–63 to advance to the west regional final where the Sooners defeated top-seed Oregon 80–68 to advance to the Final Four. Their Final Four opponent was Villanova, also a number two seed who upset Big 12 rival and number one seed Kansas to reach the Final Four. Oklahoma lost to Villanova 95–51 in the national semifinal game.\nLon Kruger is the first coach in history to take 5 different schools to the Sweet Sixteen. He is also the only coach to win a game in the NCAA tournament with 5 different schools. \nKruger retired from coaching on March 25, 2021.\n2021–present (the Porter Moser era).\nOn April 3, 2021, the Sooners announced the hiring of Porter Moser, the coach who brought Loyola Chicago to the Final Four in 2018 and had recently coached the Ramblers to a Sweet 16.\nConference affiliations.\nOklahoma has been affiliated with the following conferences:\nCoaching staff.\nAs of March 19, 2023:\nChampionships.\nConference regular season.\n§ – Conference co-champions\nRecords.\nCareer Points:\nRecord vs. Big 12 opponents.\nFrom 1996 (the inception of the Big 12) to 2016 OU has recorded 1 First place finish in league play, 7 Second place finishes, 4 Third place finishes, 2 Fourth place finishes, 1 Fifth place finish, 2 Seventh place finishes, 1 Eighth place finish, 1 Ninth place finish, and 1 Tenth place finish\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Sooners have appeared in the NCAA tournament 33 times. Their combined record is 42–33. They have appeared in the Final Four of the tournament 5 times, tied with The University of Illinois for second-most appearances without winning a national championship.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\nThe NCAA began seeding the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament with the 1979 edition. The 64-team field started in 1985, which guaranteed that a championship team had to win six games.\nNIT results.\nThe Sooners have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) eight times.

It was held between March 16 and 24, 1984, and concluded with Bowling Green defeating Minnesota-Duluth 5-4 in quadruple overtime. All Quarterfinals matchups were held at home team venues, while all succeeding games were played at the 1980 Olympic Arena in Lake Placid, New York.\nAs of 2021 the final game is the longest match to determine a champion in NCAA history.\nQualifying teams.\nThe NCAA permitted 8 teams to qualify for the tournament and divided its qualifiers into two regions (East and West). Each of the tournament champions from the three Division I conferences (CCHA, ECAC and WCHA) received automatic invitations into the tournament with At-large bids making up the remaining 5 teams, an additional 2 western and 3 eastern schools.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play. The two odd-number ranked teams from one region were placed into a bracket with the two even-number ranked teams of the other region. The teams were then seeded according to their ranking. In the Quarterfinals the first and fourth seeds and the second and third seeds played two-game aggregate series to determine which school advanced to the Semifinals. Beginning with the Semifinals all games were played at the 1980 Olympic Arena and all series became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game."

The round was completed Friday morning. Chris DiMarco shot a five-under 67 to take the first round lead. Vijay Singh and Luke Donald were at 68, one stroke behind in second. Tiger Woods struggled through much of his round ending at two over par. After the round, Woods was questioned by rules officials for an illegal putting stance on the 14th before getting the all-clear. In his final appearance, Billy Casper shot the worst round in Masters history on Thursday, a triple-digit 106 (+34), but the round was unofficial because he withdrew.\nThree-time champion Nick Faldo withdrew while playing the ninth hole due to back spasms.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 8, 2005\"\"Saturday, April 9, 2005\"\nRain suspended play for much of the day and the second round spilled into Saturday. Chris DiMarco posted another five-under 67 to take a four-stroke lead at the halfway point. Thomas Bjørn also shot a 67 to take second place by himself at −6. Tiger Woods recovered from his poor first round with a six-under 66, six strokes back in third place.\nAmateurs: \"Moore (−2), List (+2)\", Eaton III (+14), Wilson (+20).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 9, 2005\"\"Sunday, April 10, 2005\"\nChris DiMarco continued his hot ways shooting a three-under 33 on the front nine before play was suspended due to darkness. His −13 through 45 holes was four strokes better than Tiger Woods, who shot a five-under 31 on the first nine holes. Thomas Bjørn stayed in contention with a two-under 34 for nine holes and was −8 for the championship.\nTiger Woods resumed play on Sunday morning on the back nine and made four consecutive birdies to card a 7-under 65 and take the 54-hole lead. Dating back to play on Saturday, Woods birdied seven straight holes in the third round, tying a record by Steve Pate. Chris DiMarco struggled in with a 41 (+5) back nine for a third round 74 (+2), losing seven shots to Woods in the final nine holes. DiMarco's troubles began when his second shot at the 10th went into a bush and was unplayable. After a drop, he chipped onto the green and two-putted for the double bogey, which ended a streak of 44 holes at par or better.\nScorecard.\n\"Third round\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 10, 2005\"\nSummary.\nA thrilling final round came down to a two-man duel between Tiger Woods and Chris DiMarco. DiMarco narrowed the three shot lead to one by the 11th with a second birdie in three holes after Woods had dropped a shot at the 10th. The lead stretched back to two when DiMarco bogeyed the 12th at the heart of Amen Corner, but a stunning approach on 14 set up a birdie for DiMarco and cut the gap back to one.\nBoth players birdied 15 and set up a dramatic and memorable 16th hole. With DiMarco sitting comfortably in the center of the green Woods pulled his tee shot just off the green; with about between him and the hole, and considering the difficulty of the lie, co-commentator Lanny Wadkins remarked that \"this is one of the toughest pitches on the entire place here\", and that \"there's a good chance he doesn't get this inside DiMarco's ball\", who had left himself a good away. Aiming at least to the left of the pin and intending to use the sloping green to run the ball towards the hole, Woods proceeded to play what was voted in 2019 as the greatest shot in Masters history. The ball crept towards the hole and appeared to stop on the lip of the hole before toppling in for a dramatic birdie, prompting lead commentator Verne Lundquist to give the now iconic piece of commentary: \"Well... here it comes... Oh, my goodness... OH, WOW! In your \"life\" have you seen anything like that!?\". DiMarco missed his birdie putt and the lead grew back to two with just two to play. However, Woods pushed his drive on 17 leading to a bogey, cutting the lead to one as they went to the 72nd hole.\nWoods' approach on 18 ended up in the greenside bunker while DiMarco ended up just short of the green. DiMarco's chip for birdie hit the pin and rebounded ten feet away when it could easily have jammed in the hole. Woods hit his chip to , but missed his par putt to win. DiMarco calmly sank a ten-foot (3 m) putt to force a playoff.\nRetief Goosen had the round of the day, firing a five under 67 which was the only round better than DiMarco's 68.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nThe previous six sudden-death playoffs (going back to 1979) at Augusta began at the 10th hole; this was the first to start at the 18th hole, where both put their drives in the fairway. DiMarco hit his approach to the very front section of the green and the ball backed off the green a bit, ending up in almost the exact spot he was at the end of regulation. Woods knocked his approach to past the flag. DiMarco then chipped up to around a foot and tapped in for par. After taking a long time to study the putt, Woods buried his birdie putt to win his fourth green jacket and ninth major title. It was the second consecutive major that DiMarco lost in a playoff following his loss in the PGA Championship in 2004 to Vijay Singh.\nQuotes.\n\"Here it comes ... Oh, my goodness! ... OH, WOW! IN YOUR LIFE, have you seen anything like that?!\" - CBS's Verne Lundquist's famous call of Tiger Woods' chip-in on the 16th hole.\n\"Chris is a tough competitor and a fighter. He's never going to back off and he proved that again.\" - Tiger Woods on the gutsy final round of runner-up Chris DiMarco.\n\"\"I was just trying to throw the ball up there on the hill and let it feed down there and hopefully have a makeable putt. All of a sudden, it looked really good, and it looked like how could it not go in, and how did it not go in, and all of a sudden it went in.\" - Tiger Woods on his remarkable chip on 16.\n\"I went out and shot 68 around here on Sunday, which is a very good round, and 12-under is usually good enough to win. It was just that I was playing against Tiger Woods.\" - Chris DiMarco on his runner-up finish.\n\"I would let it hurt if I gave it away but I didn't. I really didn't.\" - Chris DiMarco\n\"You know I played him as hard as I could down the stretch, birdieing a bunch of holes coming down the back nine and putting it on him really. And since I put that behind me and went out and put a good number on the back nine, I feel very good.\" - Chris DiMarco on his final round.\n\"That was a hard-fought week with the rain delays, I didn't get off to the greatest of starts.\" - Tiger Woods on the long week of golf."

The award often goes to the best player on the European-wide top-tier level EuroLeague's best team. It is generally considered to be the most prestigious individual award in European professional club basketball.\nThe Final Four MVP award was first given at the end of the 1987–88 season, when the competition that would later become called EuroLeague, was then known as the FIBA European Champions Cup. Prior to the 1987–88 season, the Top Scorer of the EuroLeague Finals was noted.

However, there was no actual MVP award given.\nVoting criteria.\nFrom the 1988 EuroLeague Final Four through the 2016 EuroLeague Final Four, the voting for the EuroLeague Final Four MVP was done by the accredited media members in attendance. Starting with the 2017 EuroLeague Final Four, the voting for the award includes an online vote of fans as well.\nAll-time EuroLeague Final Four MVP award winners (1988–present).\nSince the end of the 1987–88 season, when the first EuroLeague Final Four (1988 EuroLeague Final Four) was held, an MVP is named at the conclusion of each Final Four.\nNotes:\n† The 2000–01 season was a transition year, with the best European teams splitting into two different major leagues: The SuproLeague, held by FIBA, and the EuroLeague, held by Euroleague Basketball. That season's EuroLeague Basketball tournament did not end with a Final Four tournament. Instead, it ended with a 5-game playoff series.

        "text": "The Noosa Festival of Surfing was established in 1992 at Noosa, Queensland by members of the \"Noosa Malibu Club\", as an amateur surfing competition called the \"Noosa Malibu Classic\". It allowed club members to invite friends to surf Noosa's right-hand point breaks and the event's popularity among competitive longboarders gave the club a chance to take the event to a higher level. In 1996 a professional division was introduced and prompted the name change to \"The Noosa Festival of Surfing\" (NFoS) in 1998. \"The World Tandem Surfing Championships\" (for tandem surfers) were brought to Noosa in 1999 and Stand up paddle surfing was incorporated into the festival in 2007 with live entertainment and fundraising auctions also being held. In 2008, the festival, sponsored by Global Surf Industries and maintained and managed by USM Events, commenced with the traditional \"Mixing of the Waters\" ceremony led by Hawaiian waterman Brian Keaulana. The Noosa Festival of Surfing is an official Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) Longboard rated event.\nBackground.\nNoosa was truly the heart of Australian surfing in the late 50s and early 60s, with some great innovations in surfboard design. Most notably, the shorter boards they were riding at the time. In the early sixties, Kevin Platt, one of Australias and arguably the worlds more influential shapers, designed the early shorter transitional boards under influence from George Greenough . He was working at the time for Hewston Surfboards. A later and shorter advancement of these designs can be seen ridden in the Paul Witzig 1967 film \"The Hot Generation\". Trevor Hewston was the first board builder in Noosa from around 1958 and although managing to stay \"underneath the radar\", his influence on surfboard design through the following decades was nothing less than outstanding. Trevor is still innovating today with advancements in epoxy technology.\nThe points at Noosa produce long peeling waves with perfect barrel sections. In those days a perfect wave could be shared amongst a few friends and you could camp at the end of Hastings street. Noosa today suffers from overcrowding and the unfortunate reality of development and urban sprawl. However, a good wave can be snagged if you're early and it will be guaranteed a memorable one.\nSince 2012, the festival has also included the Noosa Surfing Dog Championship, Australia’s oldest and biggest dog surfing event.\nIn 2018, the Sunshine Coast based international surf tourism company World Surfaris took over management of the festival."

        "text": "The 2007–08 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball team represent the University of Notre Dame in the college basketball season of 2007-08, competing in the Big East Conference. The team is led by eighth-year head coach, Mike Brey, and play their home games in the Edmund P. Joyce Center in Notre Dame, Indiana.\nThe previous year's team finished with a 24–8 record and 11–5 record in Big East games. They competed in the 2007 Big East men's basketball tournament and received an at-large bid in the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost their first game. The team graduated its two top-scorers between the seasons, but returned three starters and added four recruits for 2007–08. They were picked to finish ninth in the Big East.\nNotre Dame began the season playing an out of conference schedule that included the Paradise Jam tournament and reached their conference games with a 10–2 record. Currently the team is ranked 14th in the Associated Press (AP) Poll and 15th in the Coaches Poll, and has a 24–7 record overall. The 14–4 record in conference places the team tied in second in the conference, and is the most conference wins in the history of the school. Dating to 2006, the team won 37 consecutive home games, the second longest active winning streak in the nation.\nPreseason.\nThe 2006-07 Notre Dame team finished their season with a 24–8 record that included a loss in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The Irish made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2003 and the 24 wins tied the 1973-74 team for the most ever wins at Notre Dame. Because of the team's accomplishments, Mike Brey was named Big East Coach of the Year.\nRoster changes and recruiting.\nNotre Dame lost its two top scorers, Russell Carter and Colin Falls, to graduation in 2007. In addition to Carter and Falls, freshman, Joe Harden, who played in only 14 games throughout the season, decided to transfer from Notre Dame. Kyle McAlarney, a junior, who was suspended for most of the 2006–07 season because of an arrest, was re-instated onto the team. With McAlarney's return, the team returned four former starters.\nIn addition to the returning players, the Irish signed four recruits for their new class. Although the class was not highly ranked, it included two three–star athletes.\nPre-season outlook.\nWith three former starters that had experience in the NCAA tournament, the Irish hoped to have another run to the tournament. However, with only five returning upperclassmen, including only one senior, the Big East's coaches picked the team to finish ninth in the conference. Even so, the team entered the season with a 20 home game winning streak, dating to the end of the 2005–06 season.\nRegular season.\nRoster.\nNotre Dame began the season with 12 scholarship players and two walk-ons. Rob Kurz, the only senior on the team, was named team captain prior to the season. In the 2006–07 season, Tory Jackson took over the point guard position after Kyle McAlarney was suspended. With McAlarney's return, Brey dissolved the position and both are listed as guards.\nCoaches.\nNotre Dame was coached by Mike Brey and his staff. In his eighth-year at the position, Brey accumulated a 142–78 (.646) record at Notre Dame before the season.\nSchedule.\nNotre Dame's schedule was announced on September 5, 2007. The Big East expanded all of its teams' schedules from 16 games to 18 games in conference so that all of the teams would play each other. Notre Dame added 12 games out of conference to precede them. Notre Dame played 17 home games, eight away games, and four games on a neutral court, prior to the Big East tournament.\n!colspan=9| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9| NCAA tournament\nOut of conference games.\nNotre Dame opened the season with a win at home against the Long Island Blackbirds. They next traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands to face the Monmouth Hawks in the first round of the Paradise Jam tournament. After beating the Hawks, they went on to lose in the semifinals to the Baylor Bears, and lose in the third place game to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets to leave the tournament with a 2–2 record. The Irish returned home for three games and went on to win against the Youngstown State Penguins, the Colgate Raiders, and the Eastern Michigan Eagles, to move to 5–2 on the season.\nThey next traveled to New York to face the Kansas State Wildcats in the Jimmy V. Classic, their first televised game of the season. After a close first half, Notre Dame pulled away to get the win. Returning home once again, they beat the Northern Illinois Huskies before taking two weeks off for final exams. After finals, they played three more home games, beating the San Francisco Dons, the Brown Bears, and the North Florida Ospreys, to finish their non-conference schedule with a 10–2 record.\nBig East games.\nNotre Dame began their conference play with two home games before the students returned from Christmas break. With wins over the West Virginia Mountaineers and the Connecticut Huskies, they began conference play with a 2–0 record. They next traveled to face the 16th-ranked Marquette Golden Eagles for their first true road game of the season, however they lost by 26 points to give Mike Brey his worst loss as Notre Dame coach. The team returned home to beat the Cincinnati Bearcats, before once again losing on the road against the sixth-ranked Georgetown Hoyas. They finally got their first road win a week later against the 18th-ranked Villanova Wildcats to move to 4–2 in the Big East with a 14–4 overall record.\nNotre Dame next returned home to face the Providence Friars, and, although the Friars were 3–4 in conference play, the game stayed close and the Irish only won after an overtime period.

The Irish returned home for their final home game of the season, and, although were held to under 69 points for only the fifth time in the season, beat the St. John's Red Storm. For their final regular season game they traveled to South Florida and defeated the Bulls to win their fourteenth Big East game, a school record. With a 14–4 record in the Big East, Notre Dame finished the regular season tied in second in the conference with Louisville.\nPost season tournaments.\nBig East tournament.\nWith Marquette's loss to Georgetown on March 1, and Notre Dame's win over DePaul on March 2, the Irish clinched a bye in the first round of the Big East men's basketball tournament. They played their opening game, as the third seed of the tournament, on March 13 at Madison Square Garden. Marquette, the sixth seed in the tournament, defeated Seton Hall in the first round to advance and play the Irish in the second round. Despite leading scorer, Luke Harangody, only playing for seven minutes in the first half, the Irish held a six-point lead at half-time. However, late in the second half Marquette took a 10-point lead, the largest of the game, and held on to the lead for the 89–79 win, dropping Notre Dame out of the tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nAlthough teams are not officially invited to the NCAA tournament until Selection Sunday (March 16, 2008), multiple publications predicted before the selection that the Irish would receive an at-large bid. The NCAA announced that the team would receive a five seed in the tournament and face the George Mason Patriots in Denver on March 20, whom they beat. The Irish went on to play Washington State, to whom they lost.\nStatistics.\nAs a team, Notre Dame averages over 80 points per game and have a 45.9% field goal percentage. Top scorer, Luke Harangody, averages over 20 points and 10 rebounds per game, a double-double. At the end of the regular season, he led the Big East in scoring.

Seve Ballesteros won his second Masters and third major title, four strokes ahead of runners-up Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite. Play on Friday was postponed due to heavy rain, and the final round was completed on Monday for the first time since 1973.\nDefending champion Craig Stadler was tied for the 54-hole lead with 1976 champion Raymond Floyd, with Ballesteros one stroke back, and two-time champion Tom Watson an additional stroke behind. Ballesteros got off to a fast start in the final round on Monday with a birdie-eagle start. With another birdie at the difficult par-3 fourth, he added four pars and another birdie at the ninth for a five-under 31 on the front nine. Ballesteros cruised to a 69 (−3) and a comfortable win as neither Stadler, Floyd, nor Watson broke par.\nDuring the postponement of Friday's round, the possibility was raised that the tournament would not complete the entire 72 holes, as the southeastern U.S. was experiencing heavy rains and flooding and forecasts were not favorable.\nSaturday's second round went off from split tees (1st and 10th) and six players did not complete their rounds until early Sunday morning. With this extension, the tournament committee did not attempt to complete the final two rounds on Sunday, opting for the third round only on Sunday and the fourth on Monday.\nFour-time champion Arnold Palmer, 53, opened with a 68 on Thursday and made the cut at the Masters for the final time. In his 29th Masters, he stated that the conditions on Saturday were the worst he had ever seen at Augusta. Five-time winner Jack Nicklaus 43, withdrew before his second round start time due to back spasms experienced while warming up. Nicklaus had shot a first round of 73. It was only his second withdrawal as a pro, the first was three years earlier at the 1980 World Series of Golf. Nicklaus had missed only one cut in the previous 23 Masters and made ten consecutive after this year, including his record sixth green jacket in 1986.\nIt was the final major championship for Sam Snead, 70, a three-time Masters champion. He withdrew after a first round 79 as he assessed he could not make the cut.\nCaddie policy change.\nThis was the first year that players were allowed to use their own caddies, rather than those of Augusta National. Twelve players continued to use caddies from the club, including Nicklaus. The first female caddie at the Masters appeared this year as George Archer, the 1969 champion, employed his 19-year-old daughter Elizabeth. She had carried the bag for her father for twenty previous events since the summer of 1980. Archer finished tied for twelfth, one of his better finishes at Augusta.\nField.\nTommy Aaron, George Archer, Seve Ballesteros (3,8), Gay Brewer, Billy Casper, Charles Coody, Raymond Floyd (4,8,10,11,12,13), Doug Ford, Bob Goalby, Jack Nicklaus (2,3,4,8,9,11,12,13), Arnold Palmer, Gary Player (8), Sam Snead, Craig Stadler (8,11,12), Art Wall Jr., Tom Watson (2,3,8,9,12,13), Fuzzy Zoeller (8,9,12)\nHale Irwin (12,13), Andy North\nBill Rogers (9,11,12,13)\nJohn Mahaffey, Larry Nelson (8,12,13)\nRick Fehr (a), Jim Hallet (a), Jay Sigel (6,7,a), David Tolley (a)\nNathaniel Crosby (7,a)\nJim Holtgrieve (a), Bob Lewis (a)\nAndy Bean (12), Ben Crenshaw (13), Danny Edwards (9,12), Bob Gilder (10,11,12), Morris Hatalsky, Mark Hayes, Peter Jacobsen (12), Tom Kite (11,12,13), Wayne Levi (11,12), Bruce Lietzke (11,12,13), Jodie Mudd, Dan Pohl (9), Jack Renner, John Schroeder, Jim Simons (10), Curtis Strange (12), Tom Weiskopf (11,12)\nChip Beck, Bobby Clampett (11,12), Jay Haas (10,11,12), Gary Koch (11), Lyn Lott, Calvin Peete (10,11,12), Larry Rinker, Scott Simpson (12), J.

        "title": "South American Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The South American Rugby Championship refers to the continental rugby union championships for South America, organized by Sudamérica Rugby. The current name of the championships is \"South American Six Nations\", implemented in 2018. Throughout history, South American Championships have also existed for lower divisions of the rugby union championships, as well as youth and women tournaments, and editions for rugby sevens.\nHistory.\nThe South American Rugby Championship is a round-robin tournament, with each team playing each other once at a designated host stadium. The top level championship for men's rugby union, disputed annually, has received a number of different titles in history. It began in 1951 as \"Sudamericano de Rugby\", which lasted until 1998. From 1951 to 1998, only Argentina, Chile and Uruguay were the core teams in the tournament. They competed alongside occasional additions of Brazil, Paraguay and Peru, with the winner being decided on which team finishes with the most table points. \nIn 2000, a second division was added, which meant the bottom placed team of the A division had a play-off match with the top placed team of the B division, although this did not apply to every tournament due to the Rugby World Cup qualification formats. In 2012, a third Division was added, which meant up until 2014, the bottom placed team of the B division would play a play-off match against the top placed C Division team. Although like A and B, this did not apply to every tournament due to the Rugby World Cup qualification format. \nIn 2014, the tournament became a four-tiered competition, with Argentina no longer competing as a regular. However, the tournament would keep the same format for promotion and relegation. The top placed team from Division C would play a play-off match against the bottom placed team from Division B to determine which Division those teams are in for the succeeding tournament. The winner of the play-off match would earn a place in Division B for the succeeding tournament; the loser would play in Division C the following year. This worked in the same way for Divisions A and B. The top placed team of Division B would play a play-off match against the bottom placed team from Division A to determine which divisions those teams would play in for the succeeding tournament. The winner of the play-off match would earn a place in Division A for the succeeding tournament, while the loser would play in Division B the following year. \nHowever, the top two teams of Division A would compete at a separate competition, the \"CONSUR Cup\", alongside Argentina, the following year regardless of their positions of that year. The \"CONSUR Cup\" was staged in 2014 and 2015, and the events were the \"de facto\" South American Championships for those years. In 2016 and 2017, the \"CONSUR Cup\" was renamed to \"Sudamérica Rugby Cup\", but the format was kept intact. The \"Sudamérica Rugby Cup\", in 2016 and 2017, can also be considered the \"de facto\" South American Championships for those years. In 2018, the format of the tournament was changed once again: six teams (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay) would play in the top division, which was renamed to \"South American Six Nations\".\nArgentina is the most dominant nation at the South American Championships, winning 34 of 40 editions, as well as the two editions of the CONSUR Cup, and the two editions of the Sudamérica Rugby Cup. Uruguay won the tournament four times (1981, 2014, 2016 and 2017), while Chile (2015) and Brazil (2018) won the South American title once.\nResults.\nList of tournaments.\nThe first edition of the South American Rugby Championships was organized in 1951 as a parallel competition to the inaugural edition of the Pan American Games, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2000, a second division was added, which changed the name of the first and main division of the tournament to Mayor A (Senior A), while the second division was called Mayor B (Senior B). Teams from Central America were also allowed to compete at the South American Championships. In 2012, a third division, Mayor C (Senior C) was added. In 2018, the tournament was renamed to \"South American Six Nations\".\nCONSUR/Sudamérica Rugby Cup.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the first division of the South American Championships, \"Mayor A\" (Senior A), excluded Argentina. The top two teams of the Mayor A division would then join Argentina in a future tournament, the CONSUR Cup (in 2014 and 2015) or the Sudamérica Rugby Cup (in 2016 and 2017). The winner of the CONSUR/Sudamérica Cup would then be the \"de facto\" best team of the continent for that year. "

        "text": "Thomas Edward Kelly (March 5, 1924 – March 20, 2008) was an American professional basketball player. After playing one season with the Boston Celtics of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), Kelly retired and became an engineer.\nEarly life.\nThomas Edward Kelly was born at the New York Medical College, New York City, on March 5, 1924, to Edward Thomas Kelly, a New York City Alderman, and Anastasia Cecilia Kane. In 1929, the family moved to St. Francis Xavier Parish in the Bronx.\nKelly earned an academic scholarship to Regis High School, where he played basketball and graduated in 1941.\nIn 1942, at age 18, Kelly joined the United States Army Air Forces as an Aviation Cadet. He was trained in the United States Army Air Corps as a B-17 flying officer and commissioned a Second Lieutenant Pilot in 1944, assigned to the 486th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 833rd Bomber Squadron of the 3rd Division of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, stationed in Sudbury, Suffolk, England. Kelly flew twenty-nine combat missions over Germany, winning five battle stars and the air medal with oak leaf clusters.\nAfter leaving the military, Kelly attended New York University's Bronx campus on the G.I. Bill, graduating after three years in 1948 with an engineering degree. He was a member of Tau Beta Pi, the engineering school equivalent of Phi Beta Kappa.\nWhile at NYU, he won a spot on the basketball team as a walk-on, joining such nationally recognized athletes as Dolph Schayes, Ray Lumpp, Sid Tannenbaum, and Frank Mangiapane. At NYU, Kelly was All-Metropolitan basketball forward on the team that reached the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) final game in 1948. In 1991, Kelly was inducted into the Athletics Hall of Fame at NYU.\nProfessional basketball career.\nKelly postponed his engineering career when he was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and farmed out to the Hartford Hurricanes in their American Basketball League. After leading the league in scoring, he was recalled to the Celtics and was high scorer in their victory over the Fort Wayne Pistons and labeled by the Boston sports media as a contender for \"Rookie of the Year\". He played 27 games in his one-season, 1948–1949, with the Celtics.\nEngineering career.\nAfter Kelly retired from basketball, he had a four-decades career building a successful business in commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning sales in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County.\nBeginning in 1954, Kelly lived for several years in Syosset, Long Island, where he served as vice president and then President of the Board of Education for Central School District No. 2. As Board president, he was instrumental in the construction of Syosset High School, the first modern centrally air conditioned high school on Long Island.\nIn the late 1950s he assumed management of the New York office of the Trane Company and lived in Shippan Point, Stamford, Connecticut. He retired to Santa Barbara, California, in 1993.\nPrivate life.\nIn 1947, Kelly married Irene McGuire, a Bronx native, at Our Lady's Chapel in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. After her death, Kelly married his second wife, Joanie.\nOver the course of his active life, Kelly was an avid golfer, sailor and tennis player. He was a member of the Birnam Wood Golf Club, the Stamford Yacht Club and the New York Athletic Club.\nKelly died in Santa Barbara, California, on March 20, 2008. He was survived by his second wife and six sons and four daughters."

Having failed to make birdie on either of the two par-5s on the back nine, he remained one stroke behind Calcavecchia at the par-3 16th. Lyle's tee shot found the green and left him with a putt for birdie, which he holed.\nTied for the lead on the 18th tee, Lyle's 1-iron tee shot found the fairway bunker. His 7-iron approach landed past the flag and up the slope of the tier running across the green, before gradually rolling back to finish around from the hole. After holing the birdie putt, Lyle danced up the green to claim his only green jacket.\nFrom Scotland, Lyle was the first winner of the Masters from the United Kingdom, which had four consecutive with Nick Faldo's playoff wins in 1989 and 1990 and Ian Woosnam's one-stroke victory in 1991.

        "text": "The 1989 Masters Tournament was the 53rd Masters Tournament, held April 6–9 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nNick Faldo won the first of his three Masters titles, the second of his six major championships. After a third round 77 (+5), he shot a final round 65 (−7) and won with a birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff with Scott Hoch. The 1989 Masters is remembered for Hoch missing a putt on the first playoff hole that would have won him the green jacket. Greg Norman continued his misfortunes at the Masters with a bogey on the 72nd hole to miss a playoff by a stroke, similar to 1986. Third round leader Ben Crenshaw also bogeyed the final hole to tie Norman for third.\nFaldo became the first man from England to win the Masters and was the second consecutive winner from the United Kingdom.

Only 10 players broke par on day one, including 1984 champion Ben Crenshaw and 1980 and 1983 champion Seve Ballesteros. Defending champion Sandy Lyle birdied 18 to shoot a disappointing 77.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 7, 1989\"\nLee Trevino and Nick Faldo, who both shot over par on the day, shared the lead after a difficult scoring day. Only four players broke par including Ken Green, who shot 69 and had the round of the day. Seve Ballesteros shot 72 even though he had a 4 putt on the 15th hole.\nAmateurs: Howe III (+12), Yates (+14), Eger (+18), Meeks (+18), Hardin (+26)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 8, 1989\"\nSaturday was a long day that included a 90 minute delay and eventual suspension of play. Ben Crenshaw stormed to a four-shot lead at the suspension of play. Crenshaw was 3-under on the day through 13. Nick Faldo got off to a slow start with a double bogey on the first hole. On the second hole, he holed an improbable birdie putt, but was 3 over on the day through 12 holes. Out early, clubhouse leader Greg Norman posted a 68 to reach +1 and close within five shots of the lead when play was suspended. Lee Trevino, trying to complete the career Grand Slam, faded out of contention Saturday.\n\"Sunday, April 9, 1989\"\nFor the first time since 1984, the third round was completed on Sunday morning. Conditions were ideal, but overnight leader Ben Crenshaw was unable to take advantage as his four-shot morning lead was cut to one by the end of the third round. Seve Ballesteros who was +3 at the suspension of play on Saturday birdied 14, 15, and 17 to get back to level par. Nick Faldo continued to struggle in the morning, playing his last six holes in two over par, to fall 5 shots out of the lead at the end of the third round. First and second round leader Lee Trevino couldn't get any momentum in the morning and stumbled to an 81.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 9, 1989\"\nSummary.\nAn exciting final round had six different players hold at least a share of the lead on the back nine. Nick Faldo, five shots back to start the round, birdied four of his first seven holes to post 32 on the front nine. Faldo continued his comeback with miraculous birdies on 16 and 17 to post 65 and hold the clubhouse lead at −5. In the round Faldo made eight birdies and just one bogey at the 11th hole. Mike Reid chipped in for birdie on the 12th hole to take sole possession of the lead for the first time in the tournament at −6. However, Reid missed a short putt for par on 14 and double-bogeyed 15 after hitting his approach into the water to fade to 6th place. Seve Ballesteros, who went out in 5-under 31, had held the lead earlier in the day and was still only 1 behind as he teed off on the par-3 16th but underhit his tee-shot into the water and took a double dogey. Ballesteros later birdied 18 to finish 3-under. Meanwhile, Greg Norman had stormed into contention with birdies on 9, 10, 13, 15, 16 and 17 to tie for the lead at 5-under. Norman, however, mis-clubbed his 2nd shot from the fairway on 18 and came up short. Subsequently, he was unable to get up and down from the chipping area fronting the green and made bogey, missing the playoff by one stroke.\nIn the end it came down to the final pairing of Ben Crenshaw and Scott Hoch. Hoch birdied the 15th to take sole possession of the lead at −6, but missed a short par putt at 17 to drop back to −5. Crenshaw, three back of the lead after the 15th hole, birdied 16 and 17 to share the lead with Hoch heading to the final hole. Both players hit the fairway off the tee, and then Hoch hit his approach on the green after Crenshaw missed in the front greenside bunker. After Crenshaw chipped out to , Hoch had for birdie and his first major championship. Hoch barely missed his birdie putt and was able to tap in for par, tying Faldo for the clubhouse lead. Crenshaw then had 12 feet to join a playoff with Faldo and Hoch, but missed.\nFinal leaderboard.\nSources:\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nFaldo and Hoch were in the tenth playoff in Masters history and the fourth to use the sudden death format. The playoff began at the 10th hole, where both had made par every day. Both hit the fairway, but Faldo pushed his approach in the short right side bunker. Hoch then played safely, hitting the front middle of the green, leaving an uphill birdie putt. After Faldo chipped out to , Hoch had to win his first major championship. Hoch lagged his putt up to 2 feet, forcing Faldo to make his 15 footer for par. Faldo missed, but made his 4-foot comebacker for a bogey five. Hoch then had his third putt of the day to win the championship, but missed, then made the 4-foot comebacker for bogey to extend the playoff.\nThe playoff went to the 11th hole, which Faldo had bogeyed in all four rounds. After Faldo hit his approach to 25 feet, Hoch pushed his approach right of the green. Hoch chipped to six feet, but Faldo made his long birdie putt for his second major championship and first Masters title."

        "text": "The 1990 Masters Tournament was the 54th Masters Tournament, held April 5–8 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nNick Faldo won his second consecutive Masters and the third of his six major titles on the second sudden-death playoff hole over Raymond Floyd, the 1976 champion. The playoff began on the tenth hole where both made par. At the next hole, #11, Floyd put his 7-iron approach shot into the pond left of the green, while Faldo hit to within of the cup; he lagged his birdie putt to within a few inches and tapped in for the win. It foiled Floyd's attempt to win a major in four different decades. Afterward, he said, \"This is the most devastating thing that's ever happened to me in my career. I've had a lot of losses, but nothing like this.\"\nFloyd led after each of the second and third rounds and had earned the reputation of being a good front-runner in his career. A birdie on 12 gave Floyd a four-shot lead with six holes to play. Faldo birdied 13, 15, and 16, and Floyd's bogey on 17 left them tied at 10-under par at the end of 72 holes.\nIt was the third consecutive year that the Masters champion was from the United Kingdom, which had no winners prior to Sandy Lyle's victory in 1988.\nFaldo was just the second to win consecutive titles at Augusta, following Jack Nicklaus (1965 and 1966). Both of Faldo's wins came at the second hole of a sudden-death playoff, at the eleventh green. Tiger Woods later won back-to-back Masters in 2001 and 2002.

He was the first American winner in five years at Augusta, the longest run at the Masters without a winner from the U.S.; the previous four were won by players from Europe, all from the United Kingdom. Though he had yet to win a major, Couples entered this Masters at age 32 as the world's top-ranked player and the odds-on favorite.\nThe 36-hole cut at 145 (+1) eliminated only twenty competitors and 63 played on the weekend, the most since 1966.

        "text": "The 1994 Masters Tournament was the 58th Masters Tournament, held April 7–10 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nJosé María Olazábal won the first of his two Masters titles, two strokes ahead of runner-up Tom Lehman, and became the sixth winner from Europe in the past seven Masters. Olazábal was the second champion from Spain, following Seve Ballesteros, the winner in 1980 and 1983.\nLarry Mize, the 1987 champion, led after each of the first two rounds, and Lehman assumed the 54-hole lead with one of two 69s on Saturday; Olazábal had the other and was one stroke back, with Mize one behind in third. Lehman, age 35, had yet to win on the PGA Tour.\nIn the final round, Olazábal, Lehman, and Mize shared the lead entering the back nine. Mize made three bogeys coming home and fell out of contention. Lehman bogeyed the par-3 12th to fall a stroke back, and at the par-5 15th hole, both Olazábal and Lehman had putts for eagle. Olazabal made his from , but Lehman missed from fifteen (4.5 m), and the lead was two \nAfter pars at 16, Olazábal three-putted from off the 17th green for bogey, while Lehman missed a birdie from fifteen feet, and the lead was reduced to one at the final tee. Lehman's one-iron found the left fairway bunker, the approach shot was well short of the green, and he bogeyed; Olazábal put his approach into the gallery, but he scrambled for par and had a two-stroke \nFred Couples, the 1992 champion, did not enter due to back problems, withdrawing the previous Friday. Olazábal won his second green jacket five years later in 1999. Lehman won his first tour event six weeks later at the Memorial, and won a major at The Open Championship in 1996.\nField.\nTommy Aaron, Seve Ballesteros (9), Gay Brewer, Billy Casper, Charles Coody, Ben Crenshaw (12), Nick Faldo (3,11), Raymond Floyd (9,10), Doug Ford, Bernhard Langer (13), Sandy Lyle (9), Larry Mize (9,12,13), Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Craig Stadler (12,13), Tom Watson (10,11), Ian Woosnam (9), Fuzzy Zoeller (9)\nHale Irwin (11), Lee Janzen (13), Tom Kite (13), Payne Stewart (4,9,10,13), Curtis Strange\nMark Calcavecchia (9,13), Ian Baker-Finch, Greg Norman (11,12,13)\nJohn Daly (9), Wayne Grady, Nick Price (10,12,13)\nDanny Ellis (a), John Harris (a)\nIain Pyman (a)\nJeff Thomas (a)\nChip Beck (13), Russ Cochran, Steve Elkington (13), Brad Faxon, Anders Forsbrand, Dan Forsman, Tom Lehman, Jeff Maggert (12,13), José María Olazábal, Mark O'Meara, Corey Pavin (12,13), Scott Simpson (11,12,13), Jeff Sluman (10), Howard Twitty, Lanny Wadkins\nJohn Adams, David Edwards (12,13), Ernie Els, Fred Funk, Nolan Henke (11,12), Scott Hoch (11,12), Barry Lane, Craig Parry, Loren Roberts (12), Mike Standly\nJohn Cook, Bob Estes, Dudley Hart, Vijay Singh (12,13)\nFulton Allem (13), Jim Gallagher Jr. (13), Bill Glasson, David Frost (13), Jay Haas (13), John Huston (13), John Inman, Davis Love III (13), Andrew Magee, Billy Mayfair (13), Blaine McCallister, Jim McGovern (13), Johnny Miller, Brett Ogle, Grant Waite\nRick Fehr, Gil Morgan\nPeter Baker, Hajime Meshiai, Colin Montgomerie, Masashi Ozaki, Costantino Rocca, Sam Torrance\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 7, 1994\"\nSource:\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 8, 1994\"\nAmateurs: \"Harris (+4)\", Ellis (+6), Thomas (+12), Pyman (+17)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 9, 1994\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 10, 1994\"\nFinal leaderboard.\nSources:\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

It was an emotional victory for Crenshaw as it came just days after the death of his mentor, Harvey Penick. Crenshaw and Tom Kite attended the funeral in Texas on Wednesday and did not return to Augusta until that night, on the eve of the first round.\nThe 1995 Masters marked the first major championship for Tiger Woods, who qualified as the 1994 U.S. Amateur champion.

        "text": "The 1996 Masters Tournament was the 60th Masters Tournament, held April 11–14 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nNick Faldo won his third Masters and his sixth and final major title, five strokes ahead of runner-up Greg Norman. Faldo overcame a six-stroke deficit going into the final day as Norman, leader after each of the first three rounds, faltered down the stretch once again at Augusta. The win was the seventh by a European in the previous nine Masters. The first win by an Australian at the Masters came seventeen years later when Adam Scott won in 2013.\nIn the first round, Norman shot the second-ever 63 at the Masters (Nick Price had the first 63, in the third round in 1986). Opening with six pars, Norman birdied nine of the final twelve holes.\nFaldo moved into second place with a 67 on Friday and stayed in second, though six shots behind, with a scrambling par on 18 late Saturday afternoon. The par meant that Faldo would be paired with Norman on Sunday which may have proved critical.\nIn the final round, Norman maintained a four shot lead through 7 holes, and then proceeded to lose five shots to par over the next five holes. Faldo picked up one birdie in that stretch to assume a two shot lead after Norman's tee shot on 12 found the water for a double-bogey. Any thoughts of Norman winning were dashed when his tee shot on the par three 16th also found the water. Faldo's 67 was the best round of the day while Norman's 78 was one of the worst rounds of the day, together yielding the greatest comeback/collapse in Masters history. In addition it tied the largest lead ever blown in a PGA Tour tournament. This record has yet to be broken. \nNone of the five amateurs made the cut, including 20-year-old Tiger Woods, in his second Masters.

Aaron Baddeley made his first appearance as a professional.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 5, 2001\"\nThe round was headlined by the tournament-low 65 (−7) shot by Chris DiMarco, which gave him a one stroke lead after day one in his Masters debut. Steve Stricker and Ángel Cabrera shot six-under 66s to tie for second. Three players (John Huston, Phil Mickelson, Lee Janzen) formed a tie for fourth at 67. The scoring was very good throughout the leaderboard as 14 players shot in the 60s on day one and 32 players were in red figures. Tiger Woods, looking to win all four major championships in a row in two different calendar years, shot a two-under 70 to put him in a six-way tie for 15th. Defending champion Vijay Singh shot a 69 (−3).\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 6, 2001\"\nChris DiMarco added to his one-stroke first round lead with a 69 (-3) to give him a two-stroke lead at 134 (-10) after 36-holes. However, the round was headlined by the owner of last three major championships; Tiger Woods bolted up the leaderboard into a tie for second place with a 66 (-6). Phil Mickelson shot a 69 to equal Woods in second place. David Duval who was looking for his first Masters championship after three straight top 10 finishes at Augusta matched Woods's 66, and put himself among five golfers tied for fourth at 137 (-7), which included two-time U.S. Open champion, Lee Janzen. Two-time champion José María Olazábal was among a three-way tie for ninth at 138 (-6). The cut was set at 145 (+1), with notable players Sergio García, Davis Love III, and Thomas Bjørn off for the weekend.\nAmateurs: Driscoll (+2), Ilonen (+7), Trahan (+9), Puga (+12), Quinney (+12).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 7, 2001\"\nTiger Woods had his second straight round in the 60s, with a four-under 68, to take the 54-hole lead at -12, and to move within 18 holes of winning all four majors in a row. Phil Mickelson put himself in the best position to foil Tiger's quest with a three-under 69 to trail by only one stroke going to the final round. The leader of the first two rounds, Chris DiMarco shot an even par 72 to fall into third place. The 1989 British Open champion, Mark Calcavecchia, shot a four-under 68 to tie DiMarco for third. Ernie Els, also shot a four-under 68, to move up the leaderboard to -9 and a tie for fifth place. Rocco Mediate shot the round of the day with a six-under 66 to put himself at -8 and a tie for eighth place. At the close of the round 31 players were under par for the championship.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 8, 2001\"\nSummary.\nFor the first time in the modern era a golfer was able to win all four of golf's major championships in a row. However, since they were all not won in the same calendar year, the feat was dubbed the Tiger Slam. Only Bobby Jones, in 1930, under a different major championship structure was able to win all four in the same year. Woods shot his third straight round in the 60s with his second consecutive four-under 68 to complete the tournament at -16. The only golfer to make a serious charge at Woods was David Duval who matched the round of the day with a five-under 67. Duval briefly tied for the lead when he birdied the par 5 15th. Unfortunately for him, Duval would give the shot right back on the par 3 16th. Needing a birdie on the final hole, Duval missed a birdie-putt to allow Woods to only need to par the final hole. For good measure, Woods would birdie the hole to win his second green jacket and sixth major championship. It was another hard luck finish for Duval, who finished in the top 10 for the fourth consecutive Masters and it was his second, second-place finish.\nPhil Mickelson was briefly in contention on the back nine, but was not able to match Woods and Duval with a two-under 70 for the round. It was another disappointing major for Mickelson who earned his 12th top 10 finish, but was still without a major championship. Japan's Toshimitsu Izawa matched Duval's round of the day with a 67 of his own to finish in a tie for fourth with Mark Calcavecchia at -10. Two-time Masters champion, Bernhard Langer, was among a four-way tie for sixth at -9 that also included two-time U.S. Open champion, Ernie Els. The leader of the first two rounds, Chris DiMarco, shot a two-over 74 to finish a disappointing tie for tenth.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nNotes.\nThis was the final Masters for former champions Gay Brewer (age 69), Billy Casper (69), and Doug Ford (78). Because of consistent poor performances, they were asked not to participate in 2002."

        "text": "The 2004 Masters Tournament was the 68th Masters Tournament, held April 8–11 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Phil Mickelson, 33, won his first major championship with a birdie on the final hole to win by one stroke over runner-up Ernie Els. The purse was $6.0 million and the winner's share was $1.17 million.\nThis was the 50th consecutive and final Masters appearance for four-time champion Arnold Palmer.\nPlayoff alteration.\nPrior to this Masters, the sudden-death playoff was changed to begin on the 18th hole and alternate with the 10th hole. This new starting point was first used the following year in 2005. When the playoff format was changed to sudden-death for 1976, it began at the 10th hole, then went to the 11th, and was first used in 1979. Prior to 1976, playoffs at Augusta were full 18-hole rounds on Monday, and the last was won by Billy Casper in 1970. The exception was the first playoff in 1935, which was 36 holes.\nField.\nTommy Aaron, Charles Coody, Fred Couples (14,16,17), Ben Crenshaw, Nick Faldo, Raymond Floyd, Bernhard Langer, Sandy Lyle, Larry Mize, Jack Nicklaus, José María Olazábal (10), Mark O'Meara (10), Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Vijay Singh (10,12,14,15,16,17), Craig Stadler, Tom Watson, Mike Weir (10,11,14,15,16,17), Tiger Woods (2,3,4,10,12,14,15,16,17), Ian Woosnam, Fuzzy Zoeller\nRetief Goosen (10,14,16,17)\nBen Curtis (12,16,17), Ernie Els (10,11,14,16,17), Paul Lawrie (10)\nRich Beem (10,16), Shaun Micheel (13,14,16,17), David Toms (10,11,14,16,17)\nDavis Love III (10,12,14,15,16,17), Craig Perks, Adam Scott (15,16,17)\nNick Flanagan (a), Casey Wittenberg (a)\nGary Wolstenholme (a)\nBrandt Snedeker (a)\nNathan Smith (a)\nJonathan Byrd, Ángel Cabrera, K.

Americans Chris DiMarco and Jay Haas shot 69 (−3) and two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els was among a group tied for fourth with 70 (−2). Among the seven players tied at 71 (−1) was two-time Masters champion, José María Olazábal. Phil Mickelson shot an even-par 72, and three-time Masters champion Tiger Woods shot a 75 (+3). The winner of the previous major (2003 PGA Championship), Shaun Micheel, was at even-par 72. Play was suspended for roughly two hours due to rain, so 18 players completed their opening round on Friday morning.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 9, 2004\"\nFirst round leader Rose put together another good round (71) to take the 36-hole lead at 138 (−6). Olazábal shot a 69 to close within two strokes of the lead in a tie for second with Alex Čejka, who shot 70. Mickelson, trying to remove the best player never to win a major championship label, moved into a share of fourth with a 69, alongside K. J. Choi. Davis Love III was one of two to shoot the round of the day with a 67 (−5), which moved him into a tie for sixth with Els, DiMarco, Charles Howell III, and 1992 champion Fred Couples. Most notables made the cut at 148 (+4), but among those failing to advance were defending champion Mike Weir and Ben Curtis, the 2003 Open Champion.\nAmateurs: \"Snedeker (+4), Wittenberg (+4)\", Smith (+6), Flanagan (+8), Wolstenholme (+9).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 10, 2004\"\nMickelson moved from fourth to a share of the 54-hole lead with a three-under 69, while the top three golfers after round two collapsed. Rose shot an 81, Olazábal a 79, and Čejka a 78. This collective meltdown by the top three allowed Mickelson and DiMarco to rise to the top. DiMarco finished tied for the 54-hole lead with a four-under 68. Paul Casey put together a 68 as well to move within two strokes of the co-leaders at the end of the day. Els continued his steady play with a one-under 71 to move into a three-way tie for fourth. Kirk Triplett and Freddie Jacobson put themselves in contention at seventh and eighth, respectively.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 11, 2004\"\nSummary.\nIn one of the most exciting back nines in Masters history, Mickelson dueled Els to claim his first major championship. Mickelson shot a final round 69, sealed with an birdie on the 18th green to win by a stroke. Playing two groups ahead of Mickelson, Els started the day at −3 and posted a 67 (−5). As Mickelson approached the final hole, Els' total of 280 (−8) appeared enough to at least get him into a playoff. Els stumbled out of the gate with two bogeys in his first five holes, but quickly regained his form. He collected two eagles on his round, at the par-5 8th and 13th holes. Els also connected on a birdie at the 15th to get him to −8. Seeing his first major possibly slip away with a 38 (+2) on his front nine, Mickelson had to match Els' fire on the back nine, and shot a bogey-free 31, with birdies on five of the final seven holes. Mickelson birdied the par-3 12th and par-5 13th. He briefly tied Els with his third consecutive birdie at the par-4 14th, then had a disappointing par on the par-5 15th. At the par-3 16th, Mickelson put his tee shot above the pin and holed the dramatic putt to tie for the lead. He remained tied heading to the final tee, and when his approach shot landed on the green, a winning putt was before him. As Mickelson sunk the putt, he jumped for joy as he won his first major title.\nK. J. Choi finished third, which was his best major finish, with a final round 69 to total 282 (−6). Sergio García shot the round of the tournament with a 66 (−6) to tie for fourth with two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer. Four major champions, including two former Masters champions (Vijay Singh, Couples, Love, and Nick Price) were in the group who finished tied for sixth at 286 (−2). Woods' streak of not winning a major extended to seven with a disappointing 290 (+2), the same score tallied by first and second round leader Rose.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

The two were tied after 68 holes, then Watson birdied the par-4 17th. Needing a birdie to tie, Nicklaus bogeyed the final hole, one of 19 times in his career that he was the runner-up in a major championship. It was the second of Watson's eight major championships, and he won a second Masters in 1981.\nThe pair again dueled for a major title in the final round in July in Scotland, at the Open Championship at Turnberry, also won by Watson.\nAlthough he had won a major in 1975 and led the PGA Tour in season earnings entering this Masters, Watson had been labeled a \"choker\" early in his pro career, known for relinquishing leads in the final round of majors and regular events.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1905 and 1913 for the Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Americans, New York Highlanders/Yankees, and Washington Senators. A native of Philadelphia, he was signed out of the University of Pennsylvania.\nCareer.\nKnight was nineteen when he entered the majors in 1905 with the Philadelphia Athletics, playing for them two and a half years before joining the Boston Americans (1907), New York Highlanders/Yankees (1909–11, 1913), and Washington Senators (1912). Knight was in the Athletics 1905 Opening Day as a replacement for incumbent shortstop Monte Cross, out until mid-season with a broken hand. He responded hitting .400 in June, but faded after that and finished the season at .203.\nIn the 1907 midseason Knight was sent to Boston in exchange for Jimmy Collins. He spent 1908 with Triple-A Baltimore Orioles and returned to the majors with New York a year later. His most productive season came in 1910, when he posted a career-high .312 (5th in American League) and led his team in seven offensive categories. In 1911 he was considered in the MVP vote after hitting .268 with 32 extrabases and 62 runs batted in. Another deal in 1912 sent him to the Senators, who released him to Double-A Jersey City Giants, but he returned to New York in 1913 to finish his major league career.\nIn an eight-year career, Knight was a .239 hitter (636-for-2664) with 14 home runs and 270 RBI in 767 games, including 301 runs, 96 doubles, 24 triples and 86 stolen bases. He made 755 infield appearances at shortstop (316), third base (211), first base (124) and second base (104) and one at right field, for a collective .933 fielding percentage.\nAfter that, his frequent travels took Knight to the Minneapolis Millers (American Association); Seattle Rainiers and Oakland Oaks (Pacific Coast League), Denver Bears (Western League) and Sacramento Solons (PCL), before returning to Denver as player-manager in 1928 for his last baseball season. He was just briefly at the University of Pennsylvania Dental School in 1912.\nKnight died in Walnut Creek, California at age 80."

The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a golden jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Vuelta.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a light blue jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The combination classification awarded a red jersey to its leader.\nAlthough no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nReferences.\nCitations"

During a 4-year baseball career, he compiled 20 wins, 150 strikeouts, and a 3.01 ERA.\nBorn in Washington, D.C., he was signed by the New York Giants as an amateur free agent in 1954. Funk was acquired by Cleveland's AAA International League Toronto Maple Leafs team prior to the 1959 season. He made the most of his debut after a late season call-up from the Maple Leafs in September 1960, finishing with a 4–2 record, a 1.99 earned run average, and 1 save in just nine games for Cleveland.\nHis best season was 1961, when he posted a won-loss record of 11–11 and led Cleveland with 11 saves and an ERA of 3.31, appearing in 56 games. Two of his victories, both recorded in May, involved pitching over seven innings per game in relief during 15-inning games against the Baltimore Orioles and Minnesota Twins.\nAfter a 2–1 season with a 3.24 ERA and six saves in 1962 over 47 games, he was traded to the Milwaukee Braves along with outfielders Don Dillard and Ty Cline for first baseman Joe Adcock and pitcher Jack Curtis. He pitched one season for the Braves, posting a record of 3–3 over 25 games, with an ERA of 2.68 in 1963.\nHe served as a minor league manager and pitching coach, and also coached in the Major Leagues with the San Francisco Giants, Seattle Mariners, Kansas City Royals and Colorado Rockies."

While the United States Football Association gained its operating income from annual dues by member teams, most of its income came from its annual challenge cup. On the other hand, the owners of the top professional teams saw the challenge cup as a money losing competition as they were forced to play obscure amateur teams which tended to have smaller crowds and therefore gate receipts. After USFA took its cut, the amount distributed to the teams frequently did not cover the travel expenses. Therefore, the SLSL proposed, and the ASL agreed to, the creation of an American Professional Soccer Championship. That game series took place in April 1925 at University Field in St. Louis, Missouri. Over the three games, the Boston Soccer Club defeated the Ben Millers in front of an average crowd of over 10,000 spectators per game. In contrast, the National Challenge Cup final between the Shawsheen Indians and Chicago Canadian Club, played at the usually high drawing Mark's Stadium, saw only 2,500 spectators, down from the 18,000 who watched the 1924 final. At a May 1925 meeting, USFA agreed to reduce their percentage of the gate receipts from 33.3% to 15%. This diffused the ASL and SLSL hostility to the challenge cup leading to their re-entering the competition for 1926.\nWestern Division.\na) aggregate after 3 games"

        "title": "2008 World Series of Poker Europe",
        "text": "The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, participants have had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas.\nIn 2004, Harrah's Casinos purchased the rights to the WSOP label. Harrah's later purchased London Clubs International (LCI). LCI operates three casinos in the London area—Fifty, Leicester Square, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a \"style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting. So don't be surprised if we require participants to wear blazers at the tables. If James Bond were hosting a poker tournament it may look like the World Series of Poker Europe.\"\nIn marketing the WSOPE, Harrah's Casino did not rely upon the reputation of Harrah's or the WSOP alone. On 5 July 2007, Harrah's announced its alliance with England-based Betfair, one of the largest online gaming companies in the world. The agreement, the largest-ever union of an online and offline gaming company, is intended to build on Betfair's European reputation in advertising the WSOPE. Due to changes in U.S. laws, effective in 2007, the WSOP could no longer accept money from online gambling companies. This prevented the WSOP from acknowledging WSOP qualifiers from online events. The WSOPE is not bound by this limitation. The United Kingdom Gambling Act of 2005 allows for legal regulated online poker sites. Furthermore, as the laws that govern the age of gambling differ in England than the U.S., the WSOPE admits younger players. In 2007, one of these younger players, 18-year-old Annette \"Annette_15\" Obrestad became the youngest player to win a WSOP bracelet event.\nThe second WSOPE took place between 19 September and 1 October 2008. It consisted of four events held at the Casino at the Empire in Leicester Square, London. The 2008 WSOPE was particularly notable, as Jesper Hougaard became the first person to win a bracelet at both the WSOP and WSOPE. Three-time bracelet winner John Juanda won his fourth bracelet in the WSOPE Main Event. Ivan Demidov, who was one of the November Nine—players scheduled to play in November for the WSOP Main Event—advanced to the final table of the WSOPE, becoming the first player to make it to the final table at both the WSOP and WSOPE Main Events.\nResults.\nEvent 4: £10,000 No-Limit Hold'em Main Event.\nThe final table took a WSOP record 22 hours to finish. Heads up between John Juanda and Stanislav Alekhin took more than seven hours of play, another WSOP record. It took 242 hands to eliminate the first seven players and it took another 242 hands heads up before Juanda secured the win.\nIvan Demidov finished third, becoming the first player to make the final table at both the WSOP and WSOPE Main Events."

        "text": "Anthony Watts (born 12 September 1986), is an Australian, and a former professional rugby league footballer who played as a in the 2000s and 2010s.\nHe played for the North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the NRL and the Widnes Vikings in the Super League.\nBackground.\nWatts was born in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.\nPlaying career.\nWatts made his NRL debut for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in 2007. He played in five games in the back half of the season, playing halfback or from the bench. Watts was sacked by Cronulla-Sutherland at the end of the 2007 NRL season after he was involved in an alcohol-related Mad Monday incident in which he got in a fight at Sharks House, where the club accommodated young recruits.\nIn 2008, Watts joined the North Queensland Cowboys. He scored a try in his first two games with, but his next ten games played were all losses. In 2009, Watts was still playing mostly from the bench, but towards the end of the year he made his first appearances as starting hooker. In July 2009, Watts was suspended for one match after a scrum fight with Wests Tigers player Robbie Farah. Earlier in the match, Watts had struck out at Farah. Later on in the game, Farah and Watts engaged in a second fist fight where Watts was knocked to the ground.\n2010 was Watts most successful year. He played in 21 games and scored 4 tries. Watts joined the Sydney Roosters in 2011 on a three-year deal.\nWatts fell into disrepute when he was allegedly involved in an altercation with his girlfriend which resulted in him being charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. At the time of the incident, Watts was in the company of fellow Roosters player, Todd Carney. Roosters CEO Steve Noyce said, \"Anthony Watts has been suspended effective immediately and will be issued with a breach notice. The club has worked closely with Anthony in the past to address a number of issues, including anti-social behaviour, and this decision stands regardless of what the court decides.\" Watts never played first grade with the Sydney Roosters and was later released by the club.\nHe signed with the Widnes Vikings for the 2012 season where he hoped to revive his career. Watts settled well into the new look Vikings team and played in several pre-season friendlies, winning plaudits from many of the Vikings fans for his ability and exciting attacking play, but on 19 February 2012 suffered a torn right anterior cruciate ligament just 10 minutes into his Super League début during the defeat by Salford City Reds, leading to an anticipated minimum six month lay off. Despite this, he signed an extension to his contract on 1 May 2012 which was designed to keep him at the club until the end of 2013. Barely a week later he was released by the Vikings, with immediate effect in order to return home for personal reasons. It was alleged that Watts was involved in an alcohol-fuelled brawl in Widnes and was arrested for being drunk and disorderley. The police also alleged that Watts was found to be in possession of cocaine. Watts was cautioned by police and released.\nPost-NRL rugby.\nUpon the death of his father, Watts abandoned his plans for a NRL return and signed with the Tugun Seahawks of the Gold Coast Rugby League. Watts was playing for Tugun in 2013, when he was accused of biting an opposition player on the penis during a melee in a match. Watts was given an eight-week suspension, but denied the charge. \"I was wearing a mouthguard and there’s no way I bit him on the dick. It’s pretty shithouse to be at the centre of something like this, even though I've been through a lot in my career,\" he said.\nBoxing.\nWatts won his first professional fight in 29 seconds. His second bout was against rugby league player Paul Gallen. The fight, which lasted only 88 seconds before it was called off when Watts suffered a shoulder injury, was described as \"anti-climactic.\" The Sydney Morning Herald wrote, \"The way Watts was swinging them, it's unsurprising he almost threw his arm out of its socket. If this was the fight which brought you to the main event, you were sorely short changed.\"\nLegal problems.\nDomestic violence allegations.\nIn 2011 Watts was charged with assault after an alleged altercation with his girlfriend earlier that year. The charges were dropped after his partner declined to give a statement, or allow them to photograph her injuries, and potential witnesses decided their testimony was contingent upon hers. After the incident he was dropped by the Roosters.\nAffray, jail time and bikie gang associations.\nWatts became a member of The Finks and Mongols, bikie gangs under investigation for various gang-related crimes. In 2013, Watts was sentenced to community service for an affray, and to jail for numerous charges, including breaking a domestic violence order for the third time, driving while disqualified and failing to complete community service. In 2014, Watts was out on parole when he was involved in a \"drunken ruckus\" and returned to jail. His second arrest was featured on Gold Coast Cops when he already disassociated himself with the gangs, but 50ml of Stanozolol steroids was found in his house.\nAssault charge.\nIn August 2016 Watts assaulted a man at a Gold Coast wedding, kneeing and kicking him to the head and stomach. Watts turned himself into the police shortly after, and in 2018 pleaded guilty to assault, was given a suspended sentence and fined $5000."

        "text": "The Rosario Rugby Union () is the organisational body that controls the game of rugby union in Rosario, in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. The rest of Santa Fe province teams are organised under the Unión Santafesina de Rugby.\nBest placed teams of RRU qualify to play the Torneo del Litoral, along with clubs from Santa Fe and Entre Ríos unions.\nHistory.\nAlthough the first rugby game in Argentina took place on 28 June 1886, between Rosario A.C. (current \"Atlético del Rosario\") and Buenos Aires F.C. On 12 July a second game was played between both clubs, Buenos Aires FC being the winner. local newspaper \"La Capital\" (dated 19 October 1871) mentioned a match of \"a strange game known in England as 'rugby football'\".\nIn 1927 the British Isles team arrived to Rosario to play a match against a combined team formed by players of \"porteños\" clubs Universitario and Gimnasia y Esgrima due to the impossibility of joining a competitive team with the small number of players in Rosario. Players of both teams arrived in Rosario after a long journey by train from Retiro to Rosario Norte station, the same day of the match. Held in Plaza Jewell, home venue of Club Atlético del Rosario, the Lions defeated the combined team by 24–0 in a rainy day. The game (won by the British) was the first international game played at the city of Rosario.\nOne year later, Atlético del Rosario, Universitario, Gimnasia y Esgrima, Provincial, Newell's Old Boys and defunct Deportivo Argentino founded the \"Santa Fe Rugby Union\", on 14 August 1928. That same year, the recently formed union played a game against a team from the River Plate Rugby Union (current Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires), won by the visitor by 8–6.\nIn 1929 the official tournaments organised by the union began to be held. Atlético del Rosario won the two first editions but in 1931 the tournament was cancelled due to lack of teams. In 1932 the Union team played its first international match, facing the Junior Springboks during their first tour to South America. The Springboks defeated Santa Fe 53–3. That same year the Union changed its name to \"Unión de Rugby del Litoral Argentino\", adding teams from the cities of Santa Fe and Entre Ríos.\nThe URLA played with a Great Britain team for the first time in 1936 when the British combined toured on Argentina, being defeated 41–0.\nThe coming of the World War II caused international visits to be ceased until 1948, when a team formed by Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Estudiantes de Paraná was the most notable team in those times, winning most of the championships during the 1940s (1939–43, 1946–48). In 1953 the union changed to its current name, \"Unión de Rugby del Rosario\". The representative side played the Oxford-Cambridge combined during their second visit in 1956 and the Junior Springboks when the \"Boks\" toured on the country in 1959 (a 81–0 loss at Plaza Jewell).\nIn 1965 the Union achieved its greatest goal when winning the Campeonato Argentino. By those years, the URR also played the Oxford-Cambridge Combined (1965), the South African \"Gazelles\" (u23) (1966), and Scotland (1969). The URR team achieved their first international success in the 1970s, after beating Oxford-Cambridge (8–6) and Romania (7–6) in 1971. The team was also finalist during several editions of Campeonato Argentino, but could not win the title.\nThe Rosario union team toured outside Argentina for the first time in 1993, visiting England. Two years later, the team played some friendly matches in New Zealand.\nSince 1993, the Unión de Rugby de Rosario teams have taken part in the Nacional de Clubes tournament. They also were added to Torneo del Interior in 1998, and they were added to Torneo del Litoral (along with Santa Fe and Entre Ríos unions teams) in 2000.\nUnion team.\nThe union was represented in the Campeonato Argentino, a competition in which each of the 24 unions that make up the Unión Argentina de Rugby (UAR) participated. Rosario won the competition on one occasion in 1965, winning 8–6 v Buenos Aires, and have finished second a further 16 times, all but 4 finals were lost to Buenos Aires.\nMembers.\nAs of 2018 there are 15 affiliated member clubs, including Atlético del Rosario, although it competes in the Buenos Aires Rugby Union championships as a founding member of the Argentine Rugby Union established in 1899.\nThe URR has clubs from different cities of Santa Fe, Córdoba and even Buenos Aires provinces, they are:\nCompetitions.\nURR clubs (with the exception of Atlético del Rosario) compete in the annual Torneo del Litoral, an interprovincial competition that also includes teams from the neighboring unions of Santa Fe and Entre Ríos. The Litoral competition has been dominated by Rosario clubs over the years with all but one titles going to Rosarino clubs.\nIn the past, clubs from Rosario used to take part in a Rosario provincial championship. Since 2000 however, the inter-provincial Litoral competition has taken over and the provincial tournament is no longer played at the superior level. Provincial competitions still exist for clubs at underage level however.\nClubs from Rosario have also enjoyed some success in the national club tournament. Jockey Club (1997) and Duendes (2004, 2009) have won the competition, and both have reached the final in other tournaments."

Led by All-American Christian Laettner and Grant Hill, Duke won its 2nd national championship in as many years to become the first repeating team since UCLA's seven-year dynasty from 1967 to 1973. The feat would not be accomplished again in college basketball until the Florida Gators did it in 2007.\nExpectations.\nThe Blue Devils started the season as the defending National Champions, and were looking to repeat as National Champions for the first time since UCLA did it in 1973. Losing only Greg Koubek to graduation, Duke retained its core players including Laettner, Bobby Hurley, and Grant Hill and was able to add recruits Cherokee Parks and Erik Meek to its lineup.\nRegular season.\nThe Blue Devils started the season ranked No. 1 and won its first 17 games. Their unbeaten streak came to an end when they lost a close contest to North Carolina in the Dean Dome by a score of 75–73. However, Duke would only lose another game (to Wake Forest 72–68) for the rest of the season and finished the season with a 25–2 record and the 10th regular-season championship in school history.\nConference Tournament.\nDuke entered the ACC tournament as the No. 1 seed. They defeated North Carolina in the ACC title game 94–74 to capture their 9th ACC Tournament Championship in school history. As a result, the Blue Devils received a No. 1 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Blue Devils had little trouble progressing through the first three rounds, but faced the toughest test of the season in the East Regional Final against sixth-ranked and No. 2 seed Kentucky coached by Rick Pitino. In perhaps the greatest college basketball game in history, Christian Laettner hit a buzzer-beating turnaround jumper on a long inbounds pass from Grant Hill, and Duke got a 104–103 overtime win over Kentucky to earn its fifth straight Final Four appearance. Laettner scored 31 points in that game, making all 10 of his field goal attempts (including a three-pointer) and all 10 of his free throws.\nAfter defeating an Indiana team led by Calbert Cheaney, Duke reached the title game for the third consecutive time to face off against Michigan's Fab Five, led by freshmen Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson. The Blue Devils ended the Fab Five's dream run in a 71–51 contest to become the first team since UCLA 19 years ago to repeat as National Champions. Bobby Hurley was named NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=8 style=| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

It played in the Women's Professional Basketball League (WBL), the first women's professional basketball team in the United States, from 1979 to 1981 and later in the Women's American Basketball Association (WABA) in 1984.\nThe star of both incarnations of the team was Nancy Lieberman, an Olympic medalist and former All-American.\nHistory.\nWBL.\n1979–80 season.\nThe Diamonds were an expansion team for the 1979–80 WBL season, along with the California Dream, New Orleans Pride, Philadelphia Fox, San Francisco Pioneers, St. Louis Streak, and the Washington Metros.\nThe Diamonds owner, Judson Phillips, hired legendary women's basketball coach, Dean Weese, of the Wayland Baptist Flying Queens. They also secured radio rights for their games with KAAM of Dallas. These games were broadcast by Eric Nadel, who later became the voice of the Texas Rangers baseball team.\nIn the 1979 Draft the Diamonds selected: Alfredda Abernathy (1st), Valerie Goodwin (2nd), Christy Earnhardt (3rd), Sharon McClanahan (4th), Heidi Nolte (5th), Cindy Bruton (6th), Joanette Boutte (7th), Diann Nestle (8th), Deneice Gray (9th), and Beth Anman (10th). Several of these players were former Wayland Baptist stars under Dean Weese.\nThe 1979-80 season began 11/23/79 with a loss against New Orleans 106-93. Returning to the Dallas Convention Center the Diamonds beat California 116-100 to even their record at 1-1. They then lost their next 7 in a row. By the end of 1979 their record was 3-11.\nThe Diamonds biggest victory was over the New York Stars (28-7), who would become the WBL Champions for the 1979–1980 season. The 115-100 home victory would be the last Diamonds victory this season as they ended the year with an 11-game losing streak. When the losing streak reached 5 games (7-22), Dean Weese was relieved of his coaching duties in favor of Ray Scott. The team under Coach Scott lost their last 6 games to end the year 7-28.\nFrom a statistical standpoint Alfredda Abernathy (Alabama State) had a phenomenal year as she averaged 27.0 points and 14.3 rebounds per game. As a team the Diamonds were 7-11 at home and 0-17 on the road.\nThe Diamonds added new ownership during the season as Dallas real estate investor Mike Staver took over the team. Mike Staver, along with General Manager Nancy Nichols, began a search to improve the team. They hired Houston Angels' assistant coach Greg Williams as their new coach. Greg was instrumental in the Angels winning the 1st WBL Championship in 1978–1979. The Angels were also a playoff team in 79-80 as well.\n1980–81 season.\nThe last place finish gave the Diamonds 1st pick in the 1980-1981 and that pick was Old Dominion's Nancy Lieberman.\nThe Diamonds went from 7-28 to 27-9 in one season and it all started with the outstanding talent from the 1980 draft. The Diamonds drafted: Nancy Lieberman (1st Old Dominion), Peggie Gillom (2nd Mississippi U), Hattie Browning (3rd Texas), Gwen Walker (4th Arkansas-Monticello), Mary Murphy (5th Northwestern), Vanessa Barnes (6th Tuskegee), Julie Maxey (7th Missouri), Sherri Fancher (8th Carson-Newman), Brenda Winfield (9th Winston-Salem), and Linda Newcomb (10th Northeastern La.). A significant signing came from an undrafted player from Erskine College named Rosalind \"Pig\" Jennings who would be voted 2nd Team All-WBL in 1981.\nDallas began with a home victory at their new home, Moody Coliseum on the SMU campus, on December 5, but followed it up with a road loss in New Jersey. This would be Dallas' 18th consecutive road loss. This streak was broken on December 9 with a 102-92 victory against the New England Gulls. The Diamonds would end 1980 with a 5-2 record. At the end of January their record improved to 10-6 and 18-7 by the end of February.\nDuring the year the Diamonds major competition came from the Nebraska Wranglers. As the season was drawing to a close the 2 teams were fighting for home court advantage in the playoffs. On March 30 the Diamonds met for the 6th time. The Diamond needed to outscore Nebraska by 26 points to secure home court. The 108-85 victory just fell short of their goal.\nDallas' playoff opponent was the New Jersey Gems. NJ took the 1st game (4/3/81) 91-86 at St. Peter's College. Dallas won the next game (4/4/81) 92-85 at SMU before 3,278 fans. Dallas eliminated the Gems with a 107-88 victory before 4,482 fans. Gems' Carol Blazejowski finished with 36 points on 15-26 shooting, while Nancy Lieberman scored 35 points and had 10 rebounds for the Diamonds.\nThe Championship series would match the 27-9 Diamonds and the 27-9 Wranglers. Nebraska took game one in Omaha by the score of 89-72. Dallas took game 2 in Omaha 106-93. On Good Friday April 17 Dallas took game 3 96-88 before 8,117 fans. In Game 4, before 7,886 excited fans, Dallas took a 76-64 lead into the 4th quarter, but eventually lost 94-93. This set up the 5th and final game in Omaha where the Wranglers took the 3rd and last WBL Championship 99-90.\nThe new WBL team was popular in Dallas and one time had a playoff game crowd that outdrew the new NBA team, the Dallas Mavericks.\nGreg Williams coached both teams. In the 1980–1981 season, the team went 27-9 and he was named WBL Coach of the Year. After working at Southern Methodist University, he was named head coach of the WABA Dallas Diamonds. With his leadership, the team posted a 19-2 record. The team was the league champion and Williams was named WABA Coach of the Year.\nWABA.\nThe WABA folded after a single season with the Diamonds winning the leagues lone championship."

There was a six or eight-week period there where I just hated footy. I was still playing but hated being there, hated what was going on behind the scenes, stuff that I had no control over. That was the worst part. If it was something I'd done I'd cop it on the chin and move on but it was stuff happening behind my back that I had no control of, that was the worst part. Going to Parra was like a breath of fresh air, I got out of there and fell in love with footy again and it was great\".\n2016.\nIn round 1, Gordon made his club debut for the Parramatta Eels in the season-opening match against the Brisbane Broncos, playing at fullback in the Eels 17–4 loss at Parramatta Stadium.

        "text": "The 1926 AFL season is the only season of the first American Football League. It started with nine teams, with the initial game of the season being played in front of 22,000 fans in Cleveland, Ohio, but by the end of the season (December 14, 1926), only four teams were still in existence: three teams owned or subsidized by league founder C. C. Pyle and star Red Grange (New York Yankees, Los Angeles Wildcats, and Chicago Bulls) and league champion Philadelphia Quakers. The initial lineup of teams included the traveling Wildcats and a charter member of the National Football League, the Rock Island Independents, which became a second traveling team after having poor attendance in its first three games.\nMost AFL games were defensive affairs, with only New York and the Cleveland Panthers averaging more than 10 points of offense per contest. The majority of scoring was by either placement or drop kick; Chicago's Joey Sternaman scored 52 of the team's total of 88 (60% of Chicago’s points), but that was not the largest share of team points in the AFL of 1926: Newark's Doug Wycoff had his team's entire point total for the year when he scored a touchdown and kicked the extra point in the Bears' first game.\nWhile Philadelphia and New York were consistently playing in front of crowds of at least 20,000 per game, the rest of the league was not so fortunate. While crowds of more than 10,000 attended games in Fenway Park and Comiskey Park in September and October, crowds in other AFL cities were consistently much smaller: Rock Island (Moline, Illinois) struggled to draw 5000 into its home stadium; Newark did not have a total of 5000 in its three home games combined. Competing against the Brooklyn Lions of the National Football League, the Brooklyn Horsemen called it quits in November and merged with its NFL brethren.\nAs the AFL decreased in size in October and November, so did the attendance figures in Philadelphia, the only team in the AFL reported to have made a profit.\nTwo weeks after clinching the AFL championship, the Philadelphia Quakers played an exhibition game with the NFL's sixth place team, the New York Giants, in a driving snowstorm at the Polo Grounds. Only 5000 hardy fans witnessed the home team's 31-0 whitewash of the AFL titlists. While the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Wildcats went on a barnstorming tour, the rest of the American Football League folded.\nLeague Games.\nWeek One.\nCleveland Panthers 10, New York Yankees 0.\nSeptember 26, 1926 – Luna Bowl, Cleveland, Ohio (attendance 22,000) The opening game of the league designed to showcase Red Grange and his New York Yankees resulted in complete domination by the host Cleveland Panthers, with a 10-0 score. While the visitors were kept out of the end zone, a pass from Al Michaels to Dave Noble and a field goal by Doc Elliott provided all the points for the Panthers, which used mostly players who were members of the 1925 Cleveland Bulldogs NFL team.\nRock Island Independents 7, Los Angeles Wildcats 3.\nSeptember 26, 1926 – Browning Field, Moline, Illinois (attendance 2500) A charter member of the National Football League opened its initial season in a new AFL as the host Rock Island Independents defeated Wildcat Wilson's traveling squad, the Los Angeles Wildcats, 7-3. An 18-yard field goal by Jim Lawson put L.A. on the board in the first quarter, but Rock Island took the lead in the second quarter with a short touchdown run by quarterback Johnny Armstrong, who had set up the play with a long pass to Wes Bradshaw.\nChicago Bulls 7, Newark Bears 7.\nSeptember 26, 1926 – Davids' Stadium, Newark, New Jersey (attendance 2000) The Chicago Bulls and the host Newark Bears played in the AFL’s first tie game, 7-7. The visiting Bulls started the game with a dominating drive with a 40-yard run by owner/coach/quarterback Joey Sternaman, a pass to Eddie Anderson, and a five-yard touchdown run by Buck White. After a first half of frustration, Newark's Doug Wycoff gained 60 yards in a drive which resulted in a Wycoff touchdown plunge and a Wycoff extra point to tie the game. No one knew it at the time, but it proved to be the only points that the Bears would score in its short AFL history.\nWeek Two.\nPhiladelphia Quakers 9, Chicago Bulls 3.\nOctober 2, 1926 – Sesquicentennial Stadium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (attendance 8000) Making their debut in the AFL with the first of six consecutive Saturday home games (Pennsylvania's Blue Laws prohibited games on Sunday), the Philadelphia Quakers defeated the visiting Chicago Bulls 9-3, in which all the points in the game were scored by field goals. An interception by the Bulls' Johnny Mohardt set up Joey Sternaman's drop kick for Chicago's only points in the game, while the Quakers' Al Kreuz placekicked three field goals of his own.\nNew York Yankees 26, Rock Island Independents 0.\nOctober 3, 1926 – Douglas Park, Rock Island, Illinois (attendance 5000) Despite the Rock Island Independents' outplaying the visiting team, a muddy field and a slew of Rock Island penalties led to the New York Yankees posting a 26-0 shutout. Although Red Grange's team scored a touchdown in each quarter, the Yankees racked up a total of four first downs in the game. Grange scored two TDs (a 20-yard run and catching a 15-yard pass from George Pease), and Harry Fry (an 82-yard interception return) and Pooley Hubert (five-yard run) scored one touchdown each.\nCleveland Panthers 17, Los Angeles Wildcats 14.\nOctober 3, 1926 – Luna Park, Cleveland (no attendance report) After the traveling Los Angeles Wildcats scored 14 points in the fourth quarter to take the lead, the host Cleveland Panthers beat the visitors 17-14 on a 40-yard pass from Al Michaels to Cookie Cunningham. The winning touchdown was the duo's second touchdown of the game. After Doc Elliott dropkicked a field goal in the first quarter, Cunningham's first touchdown staked the Panthers to a 10-0 lead in the third frame. Touchdowns by Wildcat Wilson (a run) and John Vesser (a pass from Wilson) gave the Wildcats a short-lived lead.\nBoston Bulldogs 3, Newark Bears 0.\nOctober 3, 1926 – Davids' Stadium, Newark, New Jersey (attendance 1000) The Boston Bulldogs became the last AFL team to play its inaugural game by beating the host Newark Bears, 3-0, on a 40-yard field goal by Erwin Gehrke in the fourth quarter. The Bears lost its sole source of offense when back Doug Wycoff was injured in the team's first game and was limited to a mere few minutes in this match. The Bulldogs' offense was just as ineffectual until Gehrke's deciding kick.\nBrooklyn Horsemen 12, Chicago Bulls 7.\nOctober 3, 1926 – Commercial Field, Brooklyn, New York (attendance 10,000) One day after losing to Philadelphia, the visiting Chicago Bulls lost to the Brooklyn Horsemen, 12-7. The Bears had the first score of the game, a run by Joey Sternaman in the second quarter, before the Horsemen had touchdowns by Earl Britton (a run) and Ed Harrison (a 60-yard pass from Sternaman) in the second half to seize the lead.\nWeek Three.\nPhiladelphia Quakers 3, Los Angeles Wildcats 0.\nOctober 9, 1926 – Sesquicentennial Stadium, Philadelphia (attendance 35,000) For the second straight Saturday, the Philadelphia Quakers kept the visiting team from their end zone as they prevailed over the Los Angeles Wildcats, 3-0, and for the second consecutive game, all of the Quakers' points were scored by Al Kreuz. Wildcat Wilson's running, passing, and kicking for his traveling squad dominated the game, but each time Los Angeles threatened to score, the Quakers' defense stopped the Wildcats. The deciding field goal was the culmination of a sequence of events that began with a failed 55-yard field goal attempt by Kreuz. While the kick fell short, the Quakers' Whitey Thomas downed the ball at the one-yard line. Wilson was forced to punt from his end zone; Philadelphia resumed possession of the ball on the Los Angeles side of the field, ultimately resulting in a successful 28 yard placekick by Kreuz.\nNew York Yankees 13, Boston Bulldogs 0.\nOctober 9, 1926 – Fenway Park, Boston, Massachusetts (attendance 12,000) Professional football makes its debut at the fabled Fenway as the host Boston Bulldogs were shut out by the visiting New York Yankees, 13-0, despite Red Grange spending most of the second half on the New York bench. Eddie Tryon had a long touchdown run in the second quarter, while Bullet Baker caught a touchdown pass from George Pease in the fourth. Boston's offense may have been weak, but its defense, led by Bulger Lowe, kept the Bulldogs in the game for most of the game.\nRock Island Independents 7, Chicago Bulls 3.\nOctober 10, 1926 – Browning Park, Moline, Illinois (attendance 1700) No one knew it at the time, but an era was coming to an end as the home Rock Island Independents combined effective passing by Johnny Mohardt and rushing by Marty Norton to defeat the visiting Chicago Bulls, 7-3. Joey Sternaman put the first points on the board by a dropkicked field goal after Chicago end intercepted a Mohardt pass in the second quarter; Norton scored the game's lone touchdown in the fourth.\nCiting low attendance, Independents owner Arch Bowlby announced that Rock Island would become a traveling team, and the team's future would depend upon its performance and results on the road. In addition, center Lou Kolis retired after the game to concentrate on his campaign for sheriff. Kolis had played more games for the Independents than any other player.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 23, Brooklyn Horsemen 0.\nOctober 10, 1926 – Commercial Field, Brooklyn, New York (attendance 6000) After three weeks of futility, the team without a home field, the Los Angeles Wildcats, routed the host Brooklyn Horsemen, 23-0. Rushes by Duke Morrison and Wildcat Wilson produced touchdowns, as did a pass from Wilson to Ed Illman. The Wildcats' Ray Flaherty also had a 50-yard catch against the Horsemen's overmatched defense.\nCleveland Panthers at Newark Bears, cancelled.\nGame scheduled for October 10, 1926, at Davids' Stadium, Newark, was cancelled due to driving rain.\nWeek Four.\nPhiladelphia Quakers 9, Newark Bears 0.\nOctober 16, 1926 – Sesquicentennial Stadium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (attendance 40,000) The Philadelphia Quakers shut out the visiting Newark Bears, 9-0, in front of the largest crowd to attend an American Football League game. Unlike the previous three Quakers games, this one had Philadelphia score a touchdown: Al Kreuz intercepted an errant pass from Newark's Jimmy Brewster and returned the ball to the Bears 18-yard line, and then rushed into the end zone in a subsequent play. While Kreuz missed the extra point attempt, he did have a successful field goal try earlier in the quarter. At this point, the Quakers were undefeated, with Kreuz having scored every one of his team's points.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 21, Boston Bulldogs 0.\nOctober 17, 1926 – Braves Field, Boston, Massachusetts (attendance 2000) The Los Angeles Wildcats scored all of its points in the first quarter as the visiting team overwhelmed the Boston Bulldogs, 21-0. All three touchdowns came on long plays: a Wildcat Wilson-to-Ram Morrison 50-yard pass, a 70-yard punt return by Mal Bross, and a 25-yard Wilson-to-Bross pass. Dick Reed became the fourth Wildcat to kick an extra point, after Bross, Ed Illman, and Jim Lawson did the duty in previous games.\nChicago Bulls 14, New York Yankees 0.\nOctober 17, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 16,000) After they forced the NFL Chicago Cardinals to move to their home games from Comiskey Park to a smaller Normal Field, the Chicago Bulls won their home opener by shutting out the New York Yankees, 14-0. While Bulls tailback Johnny Mohardt scored two touchdowns, the real stars of the game were the Chicago line, who neutralized the Yankees offense.\nCleveland Panthers 23, Rock Island Independents 7.\nOctober 17, 1926 – Luna Park, Cleveland, Ohio (attendance 6000) As the Rock Island Independents started its odyssey as a traveling team, the host Cleveland Panthers remained undefeated by winning a lopsided game, 23-7. Dave Noble rushed for two touchdowns, Dick Wolf caught a 29-yard pass from Al Michaels, and Guy Roberts kicked two field goals to give the Panthers a 23-0 lead before the reserves came in. A 20-yard pass from Johnny Armstrong to Wes Bradshaw in the fourth quarter ended the shutout.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 7, Newark Bears 0.\nOctober 17, 1926 – Davids' Stadium, Newark, New Jersey (attendance 2000) Despite the outstanding play of the host Newark Bears defense, the traveling Los Angeles Wildcats prevailed, 7-0. The game's sole touchdown was scored by Mal Bross on a pass from Wildcat Wilson to cap a 68-yard drive. While the Bears defense held their own, the Newark offense (led by Doug Wycoff) was a model of inconsistency as the team was shut out for the second time in 24 hours. One day after playing in front of 40,000 spectators in Philadelphia, Newark struggled in front of a mere 2000 at home. The worst is yet to come for the ill-fated Bears.\nBoston Bulldogs 17, Brooklyn Horsemen 0.\nOctober 17, 1926 – Commercial Field, Brooklyn, New York (attendance 4000) One day after being shut out in Braves Field, the visiting Boston Bulldogs overcame a soggy Commercial Field and shut out the host Brooklyn Horsemen, 17-0 in what turned out to be the last Brooklyn AFL home game. A first-quarter fumble recovery and return by Charlie Morrison was the first scoring play, while tailback Bill Cronin added a short touchdown run in the fourth period. The Bulldogs had three different players score points by kicking: Joe McGlone and Erwing Gehrke kicked extra points, while Carl Etelman kicked a field goal. Etelman also had a field attempt blocked and intercepted a Harry Stuhldreher pass to set up Cronin's score.\nWeek Five.\nPhiladelphia Quakers 9, Rock Island Independents 0.\nOctober 23, 1926 – Sesquicentennial Stadium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (attendance 15,000) Playing their fifth straight home game, the Philadelphia Quakers maintained their undefeated record by shutting out the traveling Rock Island Independents, 9-0. After Al Kreuz kicked a field goal, the Quakers finally had someone other than their fullback/kicker put points on the board when Adrian Ford intercepted a Johnny Armstrong pass and returned it 18 yards for the team’s second touchdown of the season. The Rock Island offense stayed in the game as Wes Bradshaw's passing started dominating the second half, but one drive ended as Frank Coyle dropped a pass in the end zone.\nNewark Bears at Boston Bulldogs, cancelled.\nGame scheduled for October 23, 1926, at Braves Field, Boston, was cancelled due to inclement weather. It was the second cancelled game for the financially shaky Bears.\nNew York Yankees 6, Los Angeles Wildcats 0.\nOctober 24, 1926 – Yankee Stadium, New York, New York (attendance 11,560 – announced as 20,000) Missed field goals and a steady rain dampened the New York Yankees' home opener against the traveling Los Angeles Wildcats as the home team prevailed 6-0 on an 80-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Both the Yankees' Art Coglizer and the Wildcats' Jim Lawson missed a pair of field goal attempts. In the fourth quarter, a 30-yard catch by Ray Flaherty set up Lawson’s second failed attempt; shortly afterwards, New York's Eddie Tryon decided the game with his long run through the muddy field.\nChicago Bulls 19, Cleveland Panthers 12.\nOctober 24, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 3000) Owner/head coach/quarterback Joey Sternaman put on a one-man show as the host Chicago Bulls gave the visiting Cleveland Panthers their first defeat, 19-12. A long Sternaman pass to Buck White set up the first score, a short run by John Mohardt. Later in the first quarter, Sternaman’s recovery of a Cleveland fumble led to a field goal, also by Sternaman. Passing by Al Michaels and two touchdown runs by Dave Noble gave the Panthers the lead in the third quarter, but a 55-yard run by Sternaman set up a touchdown rush by the Chicago signal caller, who later added another field goal to finish the scoring.\nRock Island Independents 0, Newark Demons 0.\nOctober 24, 1926 – Davids' Stadium, Newark, New Jersey (attendance 400) Although it wasn’t known at the time, the host Newark Demons (formerly the Bears) played the last game of their existence, tying the Rock Island Independents, 0-0, on a storm-drenched field. There were only seven first downs made in the game (five for Rock Island, two for Newark). Neither Bear quarterback Doug Wycoff nor Independents signal caller Johnny Armstrong could pass the ball effectively as the teams were forced to resort to line plunges for the entire game. Rock Island's Wes Bradshaw missed two field goal attempts, but Newark was in no position to try even one. After the game, Newark became the first AFL team to call it quits.\nPhiladelphia Quakers at Brooklyn Horsemen, cancelled.\nGame scheduled for October 24, 1926, at Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, was cancelled due to driving rain.\nWeek Six.\nNew York Yankees 23, Philadelphia Quakers 0.\nOctober 30, 1926 – Sesquicentennial Stadium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (attendance 30,000) After three scoreless quarters, the host Philadelphia Quakers was handed its first loss by the visiting New York Yankees, 23-0. George Pease broke the deadlock with a touchdown run for the Yankees, and Eddie Tryon scored 11 points for New York as he caught a touchdown pass (from Pooley “Papa” Hubert) and kicked a field goal and two extra points. Hubert was also the recipient of a touchdown toss, this time from Larry Marks, and Red Grange was credited with 91 yards in rushing and receiving. This was the first of four games to be played by the Yankees in the space of nine days.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 6, Cleveland Panthers 0.\nOctober 31, 1926 – Luna Park, Cleveland, Ohio (attendance 1000) A little more than one month after opening the AFL season in front of 22,000 fans, the Cleveland Panthers lost its swan song to the Los Angeles Wildcats, 6-0, in front of an audience of only 1000 people. Both teams' defensive lines (particularly the Panthers' Al Nesser) controlled the game, which was a scoreless struggle until Cleveland’s Al Michaels fumbled. A few plays after the Wildcats recovered the ball on the 20-yard line, Duke Morrison ran the ball into the end zone for the only score in the game. Later that day, the Cleveland Panthers, unbeaten seven days earlier, ceased to exist.\nChicago Bulls 23, Boston Bulldogs 0.\nOctober 31, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 4000) As was the case with the other AFL games of the weekend, the host Chicago Bulls and visiting Boston Bulldogs were in a scoreless deadlock in the fourth quarter before the home team prevailed, 23-0. This time, the lack of scoring was not generally due to a lack of offense as both teams had threatened to score before being thwarted by penalty or turnover. Rushing by Boston's Bill Cronin set up a missed field goal attempt by Joe McGlone. Chicago had apparent touchdowns nullified by officials' whistles. In the fourth quarter, Joey Sternaman kicked a field goal to start the scoring; after an out-of-bounds punt set up the Bulls on the Boston 38, a pass to Dick Romey, a run by White, and a 15-yard rush by Sternaman put Chicago in the end zone. Shortly afterward, Chicago's Harry Hall intercepted a pass, setting up a Sternaman-to-Romey touchdown pass on the next play.\nRock Island Independents at Brooklyn Horsemen, cancelled.\nGame scheduled for October 31, 1926, at Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, was cancelled due to inclement weather. It was the second consecutive cancelled home game for the financially shaky Horsemen.\nNewark Demons at New York Yankees, cancelled.\nGame scheduled for October 31, 1926, at Yankee Stadium, New York, was cancelled due to Newark withdrawing from the AFL.\nWeek Seven.\nNew York Yankees 35, Rock Island Independents 0.\nNovember 2, 1926 – Yankee Stadium, New York, New York (attendance 30,000) Three days after crushing the previously-undefeated Quakers in Philadelphia, the New York Yankees returned home to obliterate the traveling Rock Island Independents, 35-0. Eddie Tryon intercepted two Rock Island passes (returning one of them 45 yards for a touchdown) as Pooley Hubert and Red Grange each had a rushing touchdown and George Pease threw two touchdown passes (one to Tryon, one to Larry Marks).\nPhiladelphia Quakers 24, Rock Island Independents 0.\nNovember 6, 1926 – Sesquicentennial Stadium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (attendance 5000) A newly signed All-American Glenn Killinger started his AFL career by intercepting four passes as the host Philadelphia Quakers continued the Rock Island Independents' futility by pummeling the visitors, 24-0. While Killinger also had a touchdown catch for Philadelphia, the game was certainly not a one-man show as Bob Dinsmore passed for two touchdowns (to Dillinger and George Tully) and kicked a field goal and extra point. Charlie Way also had a touchdown run. Six interceptions proved to be Rock Island's undoing, while Vince McCarthy had a 40-yard run for the Independents in the final minutes. The game was originally scheduled to be between Philadelphia and Cleveland, but Rock Island filled in after the Panthers called it quits.\nNew York Yankees 21, Brooklyn Horsemen 13.\nNovember 7, 1926 – Yankee Stadium, New York, New York (attendance 28,000) Eddie Tryon scored two touchdowns and Red Grange scored once as the host New York Yankees jumped to a 21-0 lead before defeating the visiting Brooklyn Horsemen, 21-13. Brooklyn's Earl Britton tossed a touchdown pass to Jim Flaherty as the Yankees put in their second string in the second quarter; Harry Stuhldreher followed up with a connection with Jim Bolger.\nThis was the last game in the AFL for the Brooklyn Horsemen. They subsequently merged with the NFL's Brooklyn Lions and finished the 1926 season in the more-established league. The merged team played one game as the Lions before playing three as the Horsemen… and then folded.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 3, Chicago Bulls 3.\nNovember 7, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 7500) Two field goals were all the scoring as the host Chicago Bulls tied the Los Angeles Wildcats, 3-3. Although the score was deadlocked, the Wildcats outplayed the Bulls for most of the game. Five Los Angeles drives threatened touchdowns, but the Chicago defense allowed only one Dick Reed field goal. The Bulls showed no offense until a fourth quarter dropkick by Joey Sternaman knotted the score.\nNew York Yankees 28, Los Angeles Wildcats 0.\nNovember 8, 1926 – Maple Leaf Stadium, Toronto, Ontario (attendance 10,000) In the first professional football game played outside the United States, the New York Yankees crushed the Los Angeles Wildcats, 28-0. Red Grange started the scoring with a 60-yard run in the third quarter. Red Maloney followed with two touchdown catches before Harry Fry scored on an interception return. Despite the lopsided score, the Wildcats' Jim Bradshaw was effective passing until team star back Wildcat Wilson was sidelined in the third quarter with an injury.\nThe relative popularity of this game led to Canadian football adopting the forward pass (which, at the time, was still banned in Canada; the game still more closely resembled its rugby ancestor) three years later.\nWeek Eight.\nChicago Bulls 3, Philadelphia Quakers 0.\nNovember 14, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 2500) After seven straight Saturday home games, the Philadelphia Quakers traveled to Chicago for its first road game – and lost to the Chicago Bulls, 3-0, in a muddy Comiskey Park on a rainy Sunday afternoon. While the Quakers were unable to mount a challenge to the Bulls end zone all day, the Bulls had a bit more success in moving the ball. Joey Sternaman and Buck White had completed passes before Sternaman drop kicked a 26-yard field goal as time ran out in the first half.\nNew York Yankees 24, Boston Bulldogs 0.\nNovember 14, 1926 – Yankee Stadium, New York, New York (attendance 20,000) Red Grange scored touchdowns three different ways (5-yard rush, 65-yard pass reception, 55-yard interception return) as the host New York Yankees shut out the visiting Boston Bulldogs in a game more noted for activity \"off\" the field. AFL President Bill Edwards was in attendance for the game and had to make a ruling after New York’s Art Coglizer kicked a field goal that completed the game’s scoring. The football flew into the bleachers, and when a fan refused to return it (there were only two available for play at the time), Edwards ruled that the spectator must give it back. Soon after the end of the game, the Boston Shamrocks joined Newark, Cleveland, and Brooklyn in exiting the AFL. The league that started the 1926 with nine teams was reduced to five.\nWeek Nine.\nPhiladelphia Quakers 13, Los Angeles Wildcats 7.\nNovember 20, 1926 – Sesquicentennial Stadium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (attendance 4000) A 56-yard punt return by Jim Dinsmore scored the deciding touchdown in the third quarter as the host Philadelphia Quakers defeated the traveling Los Angeles Wildcats, 13-7, in front of the smallest crowd to attend an AFL game in Sesquicentennial Stadium. Los Angeles took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on a Wildcat Wilson touchdown dive. A second quarter interception by Philadelphia's George Tully led to an equalizing touchdown pass from Johnny Scott to Adrian Ford.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 16, New York Yankees 6.\nNovember 21, 1926 – Yankee Stadium, New York, New York (attendance 18,827) One day after losing a hard-fought battle in Philadelphia, the Los Angeles Wildcats returned to Yankee Stadium and knocked the host New York Yankees out of first place with a 16-6 victory. Two long Los Angeles drives in the first half were capped by Wildcat Wilson and Wes Bradshaw; a safety just before halftime increased the Wildcats' lead to 16-0. A third quarter pass from George Pease to Lowell Ottie provided the Yankees’ only score as a dropkick extra point attempt by Larry Marks was blocked.\nChicago Bulls 3, Rock Island Independents 0.\nNovember 21, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 1800) A snow-covered field hampered both teams' offenses as the home Chicago Bulls edged the Rock Island Independents, 3-0, with a 20-yard dropkick by Joey Sternaman providing the only points. A Marty Norton-to-Frank Coyle touchdown pass that apparently gave Rock Island a 7-3 was nullified when officials ruled Coyle out of bounds when he caught the ball. After the game, the Independents – charter members of both the AFL and the NFL – folded. The AFL has shrunk to four teams: the Philadelphia Quakers and three teams owned or bankrolled by Red Grange and C. C. Pyle: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Wildcats, and the Chicago Bulls.\nWeek Ten.\nPhiladelphia Quakers 13, New York Yankees 10.\nNovember 25, 1926 – Yankee Stadium, New York, New York (attendance 22,000) A Thanksgiving Day game in New York had more than the usual excitement as the league-leading Philadelphia Quakers came from behind with a fourth-quarter touchdown to defeat the host New York Yankees, 13-10. The first three quarters belonged to the kickers as Philadelphia's Al Kreuz booted two field goals and New York's Eddie Tryon hit one. The Yankees took a 10-6 lead in the fourth quarter when George Pease replaced an injured Red Grange and threw a pass to Tryon for a 26-yard gain. Passes to Pooley Hubert, Tryon, and Pease set up a short touchdown run by Tryon (who also kicked the extra point). The Quakers were not subdued: Pie Way replaced an ineffective Doc Elliott, and a few plays later, Way caught a pass from Johnny Scott and ran to the end zone on the deciding 40-yard play.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 0, Chicago Bulls 0.\nNovember 25, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 3500) The AFL's second Thanksgiving Day game was a defensive struggle as the host Chicago Bears tied the traveling Los Angeles Wildcats, 0-0. Los Angeles struggled as Wildcat Wilson was sidelined with an injury for much of the game. Chicago's offense threatened to score several times, but were stopped by the Wildcats' front line. One sequence of plays typified the play of the day: Chicago's best offensive opportunity came after a Dick Romey recovered a Los Angeles fumble and returned the ball to the 15-yard line. On the next play, the Bulls fumbled, and the Wildcats' Jim Bradshaw recovered to end the threat.\nPhiladelphia Quakers 13, New York Yankees 6.\nNovember 27, 1926 – Shibe Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (attendance 15,000) The Philadelphia Quakers clinched the AFL title by beating the visiting New York Yankees, 13-6. An injured Red Grange stayed on the New York bench as Philadelphia exhibited the dominance possessed by a championship team. While local favorite Al Kreuz was injured in the game, Jim Dinsmore filled his kicking shoes by booting two field goals and an extra point after a Johnny Scott-to-Adrian Ford touchdown pass.\nNew York Yankees 7, Chicago Bulls 0.\nNovember 28, 1926 – Yankee Stadium, New York, New York (attendance 15,000) Playing their third game in four days, a shorthanded New York Yankees defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 7-0, as an injured Red Grange stayed on the New York bench. A 23-yard pass from George Pease to Eddie Tryon provided all the points the visitors needed. Passes to Bullet Baker and Paul G. Goebel set up the score. Later in the game, Tryon had a 70-yard punt return for the Yankees.\nWeek Eleven.\nLos Angeles Wildcats 5, Chicago Bulls 0.\nDecember 5, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 3000) In a game dominated by freezing temperatures and an icy field, the traveling Los Angeles Wildcats bested the host Chicago Bulls, 5-0. Mal Bross returned the opening kickoff 45 yards; when the subsequent drive stopped, Los Angeles kicker Dick Reed booted a 25-yard field goal. While both teams were fumbling the ball with regularity, only Los Angeles seemed to be recovering with any efficiency. While Wildcat Wilson was nursing an injury, fellow Wildcat Ram Morrison showed deadly punting ability, having one kick stop dead at the Chicago one-yard line. When Chicago’s Buck White tried to kick the Bulls out of danger, he fumbled the snap and had to fall on the ball in the end zone for a safety in the third quarter. While the Wildcats were technically in existence at the end of the season (December 13), this was the last game in their short history.\nWeek Twelve.\nNew York Yankees 7, Chicago Bulls 3.\nDecember 13, 1926 – Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois (attendance 8000) While the AFL champion Philadelphia Quakers were playing an exhibition game against the NFL's New York Giants, the New York Yankees were defeating the host Chicago Bears, 7-0, in the last official game of the American Football League. There was no scoring in the first three quarters as the teams slipped, slid, and slopped through the fog, snow, and slush. In the fourth quarter, Sam Whiteman led the Bulls to the game's first score, a 20-yard dropkicked field goal by Joey Sternaman. After Bullet Baker handled the succeeding kickoff for the Yankees, he passed to Art Coglizer before Larry Marks rushed 43 yards for the deciding score.\nAs the New York Yankees started a barnstorming tour of the American South and West, the rest of the league folded. For the 1927 season, the Yankees joined the NFL in a lease agreement with New York Giants owner Tim Mara, who acquired the Brooklyn franchise in payment of debts. The contract signed by Mara and Yankees owner C. C. Pyle limited the number of Yankees home games to four in 1927.\nAFL-NFL Challenge Game.\nNew York Giants 31, Philadelphia Quakers 0.\nDecember 14, 1926 – Polo Grounds, New York, New York (attendance 5000) In an exhibition game between the AFL’s champion Philadelphia Quakers and the NFL’s sixth place New York Giants, the host Giants crushed the visitors 31-0 in a driving snowstorm. A first period field goal by Jack McBride gave the Giants an early 3-0 lead that stood into the second half. As conditions deteriorated, the Quakers had trouble hanging onto the ball as the opportunistic New Yorkers converted turnovers into points in the third and fourth quarters. McBride scored two touchdowns and all four extra points in the second half and the Giants' Jack Hagerty and Tillie Voss each crossed the goal line once as the Quakers were held to one first down in the game.\nWildcats-Yankees barnstorming tour.\nAfter the season, the Yankees and Wildcats went on a barnstorming tour of the Southern United States. After four games against each other, the Wildcats went to California to play two home games: one against the local Hollywood Generals in Los Angeles's Wrigley Field, and the second effectively becoming the West Coast AFL-NFL Challenge Game against the Los Angeles Buccaneers in San Francisco's Ewing Field. The Yankees also went to California, played \"three\" games against the Buccaneers and one against the Generals, and this resulted in their season extending all the way until February 1927, practically unheard of at that time.\nThis was the second barnstorming tour to feature Red Grange in as many years. The Chicago Bears had taken Grange on its own barnstorming tour at the end of their 1925-26 season."

It is played throughout universities and institutes on the island of Ireland, as well as throughout Britain.\nUnlike most Irish university sports, collegiate club rugby is not administered by the National Collegiate Athletic Association or university athletic departments and is instead regulated by IRFU and club rec departments. Although full 15-a-side rugby union is clearly stressed in the leagues, the sevens variants can be routinely seen. Student rugby represents this first level competitiveness in the relatively small Irish system.\nOverview.\nThe colleges division systems are structured in 2 separate divisions, these are further split up into 4 smaller divisions, so that travelling for each team is kept to a minimum, e.g. Division 2 (North), Division 2 (East). The top two teams from each of these sub-divisions qualify for an all-Ireland cup to be promoted to Division 1 for the following season, the most recent of these was UUJ.\nDivision 2 (North) is also the only cross-border league in the competition, with colleges from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland."

Perez also played for the Cleveland Indians and Los Angeles Dodgers.\nCareer.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nPerez began his professional career in 2006 with the Swing of the Quad Cities, the Midwest League affiliate of the Cardinals.\nHe was 1–1 with a team-leading eleven saves and a 3.20 ERA in 26 games for the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds in 2008. He fanned 38 batters in his 25 innings pitched, walked 12 and allowed 18 hits. He was added to the Cardinals 25-man active roster from Triple-A Memphis on May 16, 2008. He made his debut that same day, working one scoreless inning in relief against the Tampa Bay Rays. He picked up his first career save on August 6 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nHe attended the Cardinals' 2009 spring training camp to compete for a relief pitcher spot, but had arm trouble and was returned to the minor leagues for more experience. In 70 total games with the Cardinals, he was 4-4 with a 3.72 ERA and 8 saves.\nCleveland Indians.\nPerez and Jess Todd were traded to the Cleveland Indians on June 27, 2009, for Mark DeRosa. Following the trade of Kerry Wood to the New York Yankees on July 31, 2010, Perez became the Indians' permanent closer.\nAfter a breakout 2011 season that included playing in the All-Star Game and being fourth in the league in saves, on February 23, 2012, Perez strained his left oblique in spring training and was expected to miss 4–6 weeks. However, Perez himself set a goal for March 15. He was throwing a 10-minute bullpen session, when, after 25–30 pitches, he felt a pain in his left side. He returned for Opening Day despite the injury, but blew the save by loading the bases and allowing multiple runs.\nPerez's ongoing and vocal criticism of Indians fans has made him a controversial figure. In May and June 2012, Perez publicly criticized Indians fans in response to the team beginning the season last in attendance across both leagues and for being booed in a game on May 17. Perez was booed in the 10th inning for allowing two runners, although the opposition failed to score in the inning and the Indians won the game.\nOn July 1, Perez was named to his second consecutive All-Star Game as a member of the American League squad, joining Indians teammate Asdrúbal Cabrera. At the time of his selection, Perez had converted 23 of 24 save opportunities; his save count total tied for best in the Majors.\nPerez throws just two pitches: a four-seam fastball at 93–96 mph and a slider at 82–86.\nOn August 13, 2012, Perez earned his 100th save in a 6–2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He entered the ninth inning with runners on first and second but recorded three strikeouts to record the save. On January 18, 2013, the Cleveland Indians announced they had avoided arbitration with Perez, signing him to a one-year contract worth $7.3 million.\nOn August 5, 2013, Perez blew a save to the Detroit Tigers, and after the game decided to boycott the media for the rest of the season, which led to a rocky relationship between him and the fans. On September 29, 2013, he broke his silence and talked with the media.\nThe Cleveland Indians released Perez on October 31, 2013.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nHe signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 24, 2013. The contract included a base salary of $2.3 million with incentives worth as much as $8 million. Perez appeared in 49 games for the Dodgers and was 1–3 with a 4.27 ERA. He was owed a $500,000 bonus if he appeared in 50 games, but the Dodgers did not use him at all the last week of the season to avoid paying the bonus.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nPerez signed a one-year minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on February 4, 2015, which included an invitation to spring training. He was released on March 29. He was re-signed to another minor league contract two days later, and exercised an opt-out on April 27. On June 24, it was announced that Perez was suspended for 50 games for violating the drug policy by testing positive for a drug of abuse.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn July 2, 2015, Perez signed a minor league deal with the Orioles, despite still being suspended. He retired on August 22.\nPersonal.\nPerez grew up on Anna Maria Island with his father, Tim Perez, who is of Spanish descent. He resides in Tampa, Florida, with his wife, Melanie.\nHis entrance music is \"Firestarter\" by The Prodigy. He is nicknamed \"Pure Rage\" and uses it as his Twitter handle. He deleted his Twitter account at the beginning of the 2013 to \"minimize any potential off-the-field distractions.\"\nPerez and his wife were arrested on June 4, 2013, in Rocky River, Ohio, on marijuana possession charges."

        "text": "Jeffery L. Jackson (born June 22, 1955) is an American ice hockey coach and currently is head coach at the University of Notre Dame. Previously, he was the head coach at Lake Superior State University, where he won two NCAA championships in ice hockey. He has also been an assistant coach with the New York Islanders and head coach for the Guelph Storm.\nCoaching career.\nJackson got his start in college hockey at Lake Superior State University in 1986, where he worked with Frank Anzalone, helping lead the Lakers to one CCHA championship, and the 1988 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship. When Anzalone left the Lakers in 1990, Jackson was promoted to head coach.\nIn his six years as head coach with Lake Superior, from 1990 to 1996, Jackson led the team to six consecutive NCAA appearances, including three straight trips to the finals from 1992 to 1994, and winning the 1992 and 1994 championships.\nJackson stepped down as head coach of Lake Superior to become the national coach and senior director of the newly founded U.S. National Team Development program, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In his first season, he guided the U.S. Junior National Team to a silver medal in the 1997 World Junior Championships. Jackson was also an assistant coach for Team USA at the 1998 Winter Olympics.\nHe left the U.S. National Team in 2000 to become the head coach of the Guelph Storm in the Ontario Hockey League. Jackson led the Storm to a 16-point improvement from the previous season, as Guelph finished in second place in the Midwest Division. In the 2001–02 season, Guelph improved once again, as they earned 82 points, finishing in second place once again in the Midwest Division, and hosted the 2002 Memorial Cup, advancing to the tie-breaker game, where they lost to the Victoriaville Tigres. Jackson began the 2002–03 with the Storm, however, the team struggled and Jackson was replaced midway through the season. He had a record of 87–67–24–4 during his time in Guelph.\nJackson moved on to the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League in 2003–04, as he was hired by Islanders head coach Steve Stirling to work on his staff. The Islanders had a successful season, earning 91 points and a trip to the playoffs, however, they were eliminated by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round. Jackson remained with the club during the cancelled 2004–05 NHL season.\nIn 2005, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish hired Jackson to turn around their hockey team, which had a tough 2004–05 season, in which the Irish had a record of 5–27–6. In his first year in Notre Dame, Jackson helped the team to a 13–19–4 record, which was a fourteen-point improvement over the previous season. In 2006–07, the Fighting Irish set numerous team records, including overall wins (32) and CCHA wins (21) as Notre Dame captured their first ever CCHA regular season and tournament championships. The Irish advanced to the NCAA tournament for the second time in school history, and earned their first ever tournament win. Jackson was awarded the CCHA Coach of the Year and the Spencer Penrose Award as the National Coach of the Year. Notre Dame had another strong season in 2007–08, and advanced to the NCAA Championship for the second straight season. The Fighting Irish upset the #1 seed University of New Hampshire 7–3 in their first game, followed by a 3–1 victory over Michigan State to advance to the Frozen Four for the first time in school history. Notre Dame stayed hot, and defeated the #1 seeded Michigan Wolverines 5–4 in overtime to advance to their first ever berth in the final. Boston College would win the championship, as they defeated Notre Dame 4–1. Another record-setting regular season followed in 2008–09, with the Irish earning a top seed in the NCAA Championship, however they were defeated in the first round by Bemidji State."

        "text": "The William &amp; Mary Tribe men's basketball team represents the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia in NCAA Division I competition. The school's team competes in the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) and play their home games in Kaplan Arena. Former Cornell Head Coach Brian Earl was hired as the 32nd coach in school history following the dismissal of Coach Dane Fischer. Tony Shaver served as the head coach from 2003–2019 and leads the school in all-time wins for a coach.\nPostseason berths.\nNIT results.\nThe Tribe have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament three times. Their combined record is 0–3.\nNCAA results.\nThe Tribe (an original Division I team since the NCAA division classification in 1948–49) are one of 35 Division I programs to have never appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Of all Division I schools today that were charter members of this new classification, only William &amp; Mary, The Citadel, and Army have never reached the NCAA men's basketball tournament at least once. The closest effort by the Tribe to reach the NCAA Tournament was a 75–74 loss in the 2014 CAA Tournament Final to Delaware. The Tribe also lost conference tournament championships in 1958, 1961, 1965, 1975, 1983, 2008, 2010, and 2015, now having gone 0–9 in NCAA Tournament berth-clinching games.\nRivalries.\nWilliam &amp; Mary's traditional rivals have included in-state opponents Old Dominion University, James Madison University, the University of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University, and George Mason University. However, of these teams, none are still members of the CAA. The Richmond Spiders, VCU Rams, and George Mason Patriots have all moved on to the Atlantic 10 Conference while the Old Dominion Monarchs left for Conference USA in 2013 and the James Madison Dukes left for the Sun Belt Conference in 2022. Some of these teams are maintained as part of William &amp; Mary's out of conference schedule each year along with other Virginia schools like Virginia, Virginia Tech, Hampton, Radford, VMI, and Liberty. \nAccolades.\nECAC South (1977–1982).\nWilliam &amp; Mary joined the CAA, its current conference, in 1982–83. The CAA's predecessor was the ECAC South, which existed between 1977–78 and 1984–85. The CAA recognizes the 1982–83 through 1984–85 seasons as part of its basketball history but not any earlier. The CAA was formally founded in 1982–83 as the ECAC South Basketball League. It was renamed the Colonial Athletic Association in 1985–86 when it added championships in other sports, and the Coastal Athletic Association in 2023 (although a number of members maintain ECAC affiliation in some sports).\nRetired jerseys.\nWilliam &amp; Mary has retired six men's basketball jerseys in its program's history. Uniform numbers are not retired, only ceremonial jerseys. Banners depicting the all-time greats hang in the rafters of Kaplan Arena (the banner in white is for Lynn Norenberg, the only W&amp;M women's basketball player to have a jersey retired). There also hang banners which commemorate their 1983 National Invitation Tournament and 2010 National Invitation Tournament bids.\nPlayers in the NBA.\nThis section is for William &amp; Mary players who have appeared in at least one regular season or postseason NBA game."

        "text": "George Lovington Winter, nicknamed \"Sassafrass\" (April 27, 1878 – May 26, 1951), was a professional baseball pitcher. Winter played eight seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1901 through 1908, for the Boston Americans/Red Sox (1901–08) and the Detroit Tigers (1908). Listed at and 155 pounds, Winter batted and threw right-handed.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur career.\nWinter attended Gettysburg College, where he was a teammate of future Hall of Famer Eddie Plank.\nProfessional career.\nWinter was a member of the original Boston American League team, which joined the league in 1901 when it became a major league. The Philadelphia Athletics passed on signing him because their owner and manager, Connie Mack, believed he was too small to pitch in the major leagues. For the second-place Americans in his first season, he won 16 games.The following year, he won 11 games. Late in the season he became seriously ill with typhoid fever, which was nearly fatal.\nWinter was chosen to start on Opening Day of the 1903 season, defeating Rube Waddell and the Philadelphia Athletics, 9–4, at Huntington Avenue Grounds. He also wound up pitching in the game in which the Americans clinched the pennant, although he did not play in the 1903 World Series as Boston used only Cy Young, Bill Dinneen and Long Tom Hughes. Winter worked as a ticket taker during the series. He was intermittently effective during the 1903 season, which the 1904 \"Reach Guide\" attributed to not being fully recovered from his illness.\nIn 1904, Winter slipped down to the Americans' fifth starter behind Young, Dinneen, Jesse Tannehill and Norwood Gibson. He appeared in 20 games, going 8–4. In 1905, he equaled his career high, winning 16 games while losing 17. He had perhaps the best game of his career that year in a losing effort. Against the Washington Senators, he pitched a one-hitter but lost the game, 1–0. \nIn 1906, Winter's record slipped to 6–18 for the last-place Americans, with a career-worst 4.12 earned run average. He bounced back in 1907 to win 12 games and have a career-best 2.07 ERA. In 1908, Winter was the only member of the 1901 team to remain with the team, which was now known as the \"Red Sox\". However, he would not last the season in Boston, as he was claimed off waivers by the Tigers on July 26. After not appearing in the 1903 World Series, Winter made his last major league appearance in 1908 with Detroit, when he pitched one scoreless inning of relief in Game Four. The Tigers lost to the Chicago Cubs, four games to one.\nWinter played two seasons of minor league baseball with the Montreal Royals before retiring after the 1910 season.\nOverview.\nIn an eight-season career, Winter posted an 83–102 record with 568 strikeouts and a 2.87 ERA in 220 appearances, including 182 starts, 146 complete games, nine shutouts, 36 games finished, four saves, and 1656 innings pitched. He helped himself with the bat, hitting .193 with one home run and 20 RBI. He pitched 200 or more innings five times.\nIn 2007, Winter was ranked at #94 in a list of the Top 100 Red Sox by a group of Red Sox bloggers.\nDeath.\nWinter died in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey at age 73 and was interred at Riverview Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware."

        "text": "The Charleston Cougars men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team representing the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. The Cougars compete in the Coastal Athletic Association. Home games are played at TD Arena, located on College of Charleston's campus. While a member of the NAIA, they were National Champions in 1983. The Cougars have appeared seven times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2024.\nHistory.\nThe College of Charleston has sponsored a men's basketball team since 1898. They have been NCAA Division I since 1991 in the Trans-Atlantic Athletic Conference (now ASUN Conference), the Southern Conference and presently the Coastal Athletic Association (formerly the Colonial Athletic Association). In 2012, ESPN ranked Charleston as the 73rd best college basketball program in the previous 50 years, which was the highest ranking of all Division I teams in the state of South Carolina.\nJohn Kresse era (1979–2001).\nUnder head coach John Kresse, the team had its greatest success. In 1983, the Cougars won the NAIA Championship. In the 1991–92 season, the Cougars made the jump to Division I and beat UNC–Charlotte in their first game. In the 1998–99 season, the team joined the Southern Conference, winning its only SoCon tournament championship that year. In 1994, 1997, 1998 and 1999, the Cougars reached the NCAA tournament, with a record of 1–4, beating Maryland in the opening round in 1997. In 1995 and 1996, the Cougars made the NIT.\nThe program's biggest regular season win in school history was over then-No. 3 North Carolina on the road on December 6, 1998. Kresse's career record at Charleston is 560–143.\nTom Herrion era (2002–06).\nMany consider this a dark age for the program, despite still recording winning seasons and a NIT berth in 2003. The Cougars' strength of schedule slid into decline and players with questionable reputations filled the roster. Tom Herrion's first Charleston team finished 25–8 in 2002–03, captured the Great Alaska Shootout title and advanced to the NIT. His 25 victories marked the highest total of any first-year NCAA Division I head coach during the 2002–03 season. Herrion also guided the Cougars to a 20–9 finish in 2003–04, 18–10 performance in 2004–05 and 17–11 record in 2005–06. Herrion's final record was 80–38.\nBobby Cremins era (2006–12).\nThe College of Charleston hired former Georgia Tech head coach Bobby Cremins in 2006. In each of Cremins' five complete seasons, Charleston won 20 games and Cremins won the SoCon Coach of the Year award in 2011. The Cougars played in a national postseason tournament in three consecutive seasons under Cremins, making the CBI in 2009 and 2010 and the NIT in 2011. During Cremins' tenure, the Cougars were put back in the national spotlight when they upset then-No.9 North Carolina on January 4, 2010, at TD Arena. He took a leave of absence during the 2011–2012 season due to exhaustion and retired at the conclusion of the season. His overall record at Charleston is 125–68.\nDoug Wojcik era (2012–14).\nDoug Wojcik, University of Tulsa's all-time wins leader, was named the 22nd all-time head men's basketball coach at the College of Charleston on April 1, 2012. In his first season with the Cougars, Wojcik led Charleston to the SoCon Championship before losing to Davidson. The Cougars were added to the CBI postseason tournament, losing to George Mason in the first round. Charleston moved to the Colonial Athletic Association (now the Coastal Athletic Association) in 2013 and Wojcik's Cougars struggled to a 6–10 conference record. He was fired on August 5, 2014, with a 38–29 overall record.\nEarl Grant era (2014–2021).\nEarl Grant, a former Clemson and Wichita State assistant, was named the Cougars' 23rd all-time head coach on September 2, 2014. Charleston struggled in Grant's first year at the helm, finishing the season with just nine wins. The Cougars did, however, win their first-ever CAA tournament game, a 56–48 decision over Drexel in the first round. Grant got his first signature win with Charleston on November 30, 2015, when the Cougars defeated LSU 70–58 at TD Arena.\nGrant's Cougars experienced the national postseason for the first time under his watch during the 2016–17 season. After finishing the regular season with a 23–8 record and losing in the CAA Tournament final, Charleston received an at-large bid to the NIT as a five seed. The Cougars ultimately lost at Colorado State, 81–74.\nIn the 2017–18 season, Coach Grant and the Cougars managed a 26–8 record going 14–4 in the conference and undefeated at home, with sweeps over conference teams Delaware, Hofstra, Northeastern and UNC Wilmington. The Cougars would take the regular-season conference championship in a 79–58 win over Elon and would go into the CAA Conference tournament as a #1 seed, going on to win the tournament championship in an 83–76 OT win over Northeastern. Charleston would then receive a #13 seed spot in the 2018 NCAA Tournament and play #4 Auburn in San Diego, CA. After the season, Grant left to be head coach of Boston College.\nPat Kelsey era (2021–2024).\nThe Cougars hired Pat Kelsey, former head coach at Winthrop University, on March 25, 2021. Kelsey led the Cougars for just three seasons, but his era at Charleston is considered one of the most successful in program history. He led the team to a 75–27 (.735) overall record over his three seasons at the helm, including two conference regular season titles, two conference championship titles and two NCAA tournament appearances. He also introduced the \"Our City\" motto, meant to unite support for the team with the city of Charleston.\nHis team finished the 2022–23 season with a 31–4 record, including 4 weeks in the AP Top 25 poll, a conference championship title, and an NCAA tournament appearance. The team also won the Charleston Classic for the first time in program history. Kelsey signed an amended 5-year contract with the College of Charleston that would pay him a $1.1 million base salary, making him highest paid head coach in the Coastal Athletic Association.\nThe success continued into the 2023–24 season as he led the program to its first outright regular season title since 2003 and was named the Coastal Athletic Association Coach of the Year. Following the end of the season, Kelsey accepted the position as head coach at the University of Louisville.\nCollege of Charleston president Andrew Hsu praised Kelsey upon news of his new position at Louisville, saying \"he brought so much energy and excitement to Our City ... his impact goes far beyond basketball. His success reignited a premiere basketball school in a premiere city.\"\nChris Mack era (2024-present).\nChris Mack, the former head coach at Xavier University and the University of Louisville, for whom Pat Kelsey was an assistant coach at the former, was named the 8th head coach in the program's Division I history on April 2, 2024. He came to Charleston following a 2-year coaching hiatus and was immediately faced with putting together a new team and coaching staff. Multiple players from the 2023–24 season transferred to other programs, and Kelsey took most of his coaching staff with him to Louisville. Mack hired former UMass head coach Matt McCall, former Saint Louis assistant coach Chris Harriman, and former NBA player Jeff McInnis as his assistant coaches.\nYear-by-year history.\nCharleston's history since joining Division I in 1991.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Cougars have appeared in the NCAA tournament seven times. Their combined record is 1–7.\nNIT results.\nThe Cougars have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 4–5.\nCBI results.\nThe Cougars have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) three times.

        "title": "Morgan State Bears lacrosse",
        "text": "The Morgan State Bears lacrosse team is the collegiate sports team representing Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. Upon its founding in 1970, it was the only lacrosse team established to play NCAA-level lacrosse at a historically black institution. \nIn its early years, team defeated schools like Harvard and Notre Dame and upset a #1 ranked team in 1975. The team's exploits are recounted in the book \"Ten Bears\", and the story is in production for a major motion picture. The program was later shut down, though a club team was created in the 21st century and a new intercollegiate team at the school won the NCL championship in 2023.\nHistory.\nMorgan State University was founded and chartered in 1867 as the Centenary Biblical Institute. It was built on its present site, in northeast Baltimore, in 1890 and was known as Morgan College from 1890 to 1938. It became a public college in 1939, as Morgan State College. \nThe late 1960s were turbulent years with regard to race relations in the United States. Riots had broken out in major cities across the country, with at least three in Maryland. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated and formerly all white universities and colleges were opening their doors to African-Americans for the first time. But the major lacrosse powers like Johns Hopkins, Navy and Maryland still fielded mostly white teams.\nThe team was formed in 1970 when a former Baltimore high school lacrosse player and Morgan grad student, Howard \"Chip\" Silverman, realized that many of black Baltimore's high school lacrosse players were at Morgan, but were not playing lacrosse. Silverman had never coached before, but, he put up flyers around campus, and 30 athletes showed up for a meeting. Two-thirds were football players. Some would later star in the NFL, such as Stan Cherry. Silverman started the lacrosse club and two years later petitioned the NCAA for full membership as a college team. At that time, the NCAA had its best 40 teams in Division I and another 80 teams in Division II. It was Division II that Morgan would soon dominate.\nIronically, by 1975 Morgan became noted for its lacrosse team because black high school lacrosse players from Maryland and New York still had trouble getting into the major white lacrosse colleges and universities. Morgan was the first (and until the turn of the 21st century) the only historically black university to field a lacrosse team.\nDuring the period from 1970 to 1975, the Bears were ranked in the nation's top 25 in four out of five years. They made the championship tournament twice, and in 1975 were involved in one of the great upsets in intercollegiate sports history, when Morgan defeated then #1 ranked Washington and Lee University, a lacrosse team which would eventually reach the NCAA Division I semi-finals as the number seven seed. Washington &amp; Lee had not lost a regular season or home game the prior two seasons.\nAfter the 1975 season, Silverman retired as the Bears lacrosse coach, and Morgan never again had a winning season. By 1981 Title IX funding priorities required university athletic funds be equally distributed among women's programs and the school dropped lacrosse in 1981.\nThe 1981 Bears team featured some of the most talented players in the nation. Gene White, who would later coach the newly formed club team in 2005, and Lou Carter where NCAA Top 25 scoring leaders while goalie Cedric White was in the NCAA Top 10 in goals blocked during the season. In addition, there were a core of freshmen and sophomores who had played the game at early ages that gave the team even more potential for the next seasons that would not be. As a testament to the Bears' legacy, the 1981 team coached by National Lacrosse Hall of Fame inductee (2005) Sheldon Freed, defeated Notre Dame (13-12), Villanova (16-9), Michigan State and Georgetown in the span of a five-day schedule during the middle of the season. and lost to Loyola in the NCAA Division II Championship Semi-Finals to end an era.\n21st-century comeback.\nMore than 20 years after the original team was shut down, Morgan State returned to lacrosse. In 2005 a lacrosse club team was formed on campus and is awaiting acceptance into the NCAA. Coach Gene White, a player from the original incarnation, commented, \"I think it is the greatest thing that has happened since I played for Morgan in '81\". The 2005 club was not a sanctioned team in NCAA competition, but they did play exhibition games against teams that were.\nNCL era.\nIn 2023 Morgan made another return to lacrosse in the form of NCL (Next Collegiate League). They went 12-1, led By Charles Pitt II and Jaden Scott, leading the Bears to the NCL Championship. The team is now coached by Skylar Hargrave, Devin Richards, Ibukun Alo, and Bill Krehnbrink, who also volunteers his services for Coppin State University.\nMorgan State University Division II / III All-Americans.\nAs listed by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association:\nMorgan State University Representatives in the North/South Game.\nAs listed by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association:\nLegacy.\nIn 2015, US Lacrosse announced that it would create a permanent exhibit in its new museum to honor the Morgan State lacrosse team.\nAlumni.\nStan Cherry was signed as a linebacker in the National Football League.\nBoth Tony Fulton and Curt Anderson were elected to the Maryland House of Delegates\nThree time all-American Joe Fowlkes became a security consultant, while George Kelley went into law enforcement.\nDr. Miles Harrison and Coach Chip Silverman collaborated on the book, \"Ten Bears\", which is being made into a movie. Silverman died in March 2008. Dr. Harrison's son, Kyle Harrison, was the #1 draft pick of Major League Lacrosse in 2005, after leading Johns Hopkins to a national championship the same year and winning the Tewaaraton trophy.\nIn popular media.\nTwo documentaries have been shot on the team, one, produced by Jeremy Schaap, aired on ESPN in 2006 and the second, produced by Luke David, airs on PBS in early April, 2008.\nSeason-by-season results.\n \nExternal links.\nVideos uploaded to Vimeo (2016):\nVideos uploaded to YouTube (2015):"

        "text": "The Atlantic Coast Conference (founded in 1953) is one of the premier college basketball conferences in NCAA Division I. The current ACC champions are the NC State Wolfpack.\nHistory.\nThe early roots of ACC basketball began primarily thanks to two men: Everett Case and Frank McGuire. Case had been a successful high school coach in Indiana who accepted the head coaching job at North Carolina State at a time that the school's athletic department had decided to focus on competing in football on a level with Duke, then a national power in college football. Case's North Carolina State teams dominated the early years of the ACC with a modern, fast-paced style of play. He became the fastest college basketball coach to reach many \"games won\" milestones.\nCase eventually became known as \"The Father of ACC Basketball.\" Despite his success on the court, he may have been even a better promoter off-the-court. Case realized the need to sell his program and university. State had originally started construction on Reynolds Coliseum in 1941, but stopped construction during the war. It was originally slated to seat 10,000 people, but Case persuaded school officials to expand the arena to 12,400 people. It opened as the new home court for his team in 1949; at the time, it was the largest on-campus arena in the South. As such, it was used as the host site for many Southern Conference tournaments, ACC tournaments, and the \"Dixie Classic\", an annual event involving the four ACC teams from North Carolina as well as four other prominent programs from across the nation. The Dixie Classic brought in large revenues for all schools involved and soon became one of the premier sporting events in the South.\nPartly to counter Case's personality, as well as the dominant success of his program, North Carolina convinced St. John's head coach Frank McGuire to come to Chapel Hill in 1952. McGuire knew that largely due to Case's influence, basketball was now the major high school athletic event of the region, unlike football in the South. He not only tapped the growing market of high school talent in North Carolina, but also brought several recruits from his home territory in New York City as well. Case and McGuire literally \"invented\" a rivalry. Both men realized the benefits created through a rivalry between them. It brought more national attention to both of their programs and increased fan support on both sides. For this reason, they often exchanged verbal jabs at each other in public, while maintaining a secret working relationship in private.\nAfter State was slapped with crippling NCAA sanctions before the 1956–57 season, McGuire's North Carolina team stepped into the breach and delivered the ACC its first national championship. During the Tar Heels' championship run, Greensboro entrepreneur Castleman D. Chesley noticed the popularity that it generated. He hastily cobbled together a five-station television network to broadcast the Final Four. That network began broadcasting regular season ACC games the following season. From that point on, ACC basketball gained large popularity. Chesley's network continued until Metrosports took it over in 1981, handing it to Raycom Sports took it over in 1982; it was the direct ancestor of today's ACC Network.\nScheduling partners.\nThe table below lists each school's permanent men's basketball only scheduling partners after expansion in 2013 and the replacement of Maryland by Louisville in 2014.\nMen's basketball titles by school.\nAs explained in the main article about the league, the ACC does not recognize any team other than the conference tournament winner as the champion for a given season. Accordingly, this table sorts the schools primarily by number of tournament wins, using first-place regular season finishes and NCAA championships as tiebreakers where needed."

        "text": "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill men's basketball program honors fifty-one former players by hanging their jerseys in the rafters of the Dean E. Smith Center, the home to the men's basketball team on the university's campus. Of these, eight are both honored and retired. However, only seven jersey numbers are retired, as honoree Jack Cobb played before jersey numbers were the norm, meaning he had no number to retire. Justin Jackson and Joel Berry are the most recent players to be honored, following the 2016–17 season. Jackson qualified by being named the ACC Player of the Year and a first-team All-American. Berry was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 2017 Final Four.\nCriteria.\nNorth Carolina requires that players must be recognized for excellence for their performance during the regular season, in post-season play, or in the Olympics. Specifically, a player's jersey qualifies for honoring if he receives one or more of the following five awards: first- or second-team All-America on one of the major All-American teams that qualify a player for a consensus All-American designation, an ACC Player of the Year, the Most Valuable Player of a National Championship-winning team (as voted by coaches and teammates), the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player of a Final Four team, or a gold medal in basketball at the Olympics.\nAdditionally, a player can also achieve the even greater honor of having his jersey (along with his uniform number) permanently retired by the University of North Carolina. To attain jersey retirement, a Tar Heel must win one or more of the following six national player of the year awards: Associated Press, National Association of Basketball Coaches, \"Sporting News\", John R. Wooden Award, Oscar Robertson Trophy, or the Naismith College Player of the Year. The (now defunct) Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year award formerly served as a seventh option. The most recent player to merit bestowal of this honor is Tyler Hansbrough, who won all six of the national player of the year awards in his 2007–08 season.\nHonored players.\nPlayers whose numbers are retired are shown with a blue background."

        "text": "Ryan Patrick Sheridan (born 24 May 1975) is a rugby league coach, and a former Ireland international rugby league footballer. Sheridan was an Ireland international and played at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Ryan Sheridan was one of the most influential players in the late 1990s for the Rhinos.\nPlaying career.\n1990s.\nSheridan was born in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, England, and he started his career with Dewsbury Moor ARLFC, and signed professionally with Sheffield Eagles in July 1991 making a total of 97 appearances, including 79 starts for the Sheffield Eagles in his six seasons at the club. He scored 40 tries and one drop goal.\nHaving joined the Leeds club in December 1996 from Sheffield Eagles, Sheridan was originally seen as a utility player and in his first season mixed between scrum half and hooker. However, with the arrival of Graham Murray in 1998, Sheridan came of age and was the perfect foil to the individual brilliance of Iestyn Harris with his organisational skills. He played for the Leeds Rhinos at scrum half in their 1998 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Wigan Warriors.\nSheridan saved his best performances for the Rhinos for the Challenge Cup, a competition he seemed to have a love affair with. In 1999 he was man of the match in all three crucial games on the way to the Final against Wigan, St Helens and then Bradford in the semi-final. His incredible pinching of the ball from Danny Peacock in the latter stages of the first half turned the game on its head and assured the Rhinos place at Wembley. Indeed, in the final but for Leroy Rivett's late burst of four tries, Sheridan would surely have won the Lance Todd Trophy. He was magnificent under the twin towers, twice denying London in the opening quarter as they threatened to cause a huge upset. His last-ditch tackle on Shaun Edwards, and then Karle Hammond steadied the ship before the second half onslaught began. Ryan rose to international status in 1999 when he earned a place in the Great Britain squad that played in the 1999 Tri-Nations series Down Under. He started the first game against Australia and was then on the bench against New Zealand.\n2000s.\nIn the year 2000 Ryan teamed up with St Helens' Tommy Martyn for Ireland to form one of the most dangerous half back combinations in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Sheridan was outstanding for the Irish particularly in the crucial final group game against the New Zealand Māori rugby league team. Sheridan was also back to his best in the cup again claiming man of the match awards three more times, a run which continued right up until 2002 when he again scooped the award in the memorable win over Bradford Bulls at Valley Parade. Sheridan's time at Leeds was only interrupted by a serious muscle tear in 2001 which virtually ruled him out for the whole season. In total, Sheridan made 145 starts for Leeds plus 9 substitute appearances. He scored 59 tries and four drop goals to give him a total of 240 points in the Blue and Amber. He returned to representative rugby in 2002 when he captained Yorkshire in both Origin games and then represented Great Britain against Australia in Sydney in July of that year.\nRyan left the Rhinos in November 2002 and joined Super League rivals Widnes Vikings; the following year he joined Castleford Tigers.\nCoaching career.\nRyan joined and coached alongside Daryl Powell at Featherstone Rovers. Sheridan followed Powell to Castleford in 2013, and again in 2022 when Powell became head coach at Warrington Wolves."

        "text": "The Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse team represents Johns Hopkins University in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college lacrosse.\nSince 2015, the Blue Jays have represented the Big Ten Conference.\nOverview.\nThe team was founded in 1883 and is the school's most prominent sports team. The Blue Jays have won forty-four national championships including nine NCAA Division I titles (2007, 2005, 1987, 1985, 1984, 1980, 1979, 1978, 1974), twenty-nine USILL/USILA titles, and six ILA titles, first all time by any college lacrosse team and second to Syracuse in NCAA era national titles.\nHopkins competes with Maryland in college lacrosse's most historic rivalry, the two teams having met more than 100 times, both joining the Big Ten Conference in the 2014–2015 season. They have competed annually since 2015 for \"The Rivalry Trophy\", a large wooden crab. The Blue Jays also consider Princeton and Syracuse, their top competitors for the national title in the NCAA era, as significant rivals, and play Loyola in the cross-town \"Charles Street Massacre\". Another heated rivalry is with Virginia with whom Hopkins has competed annually for the Doyle Smith Cup which was first awarded in 2006. In-state opponents include Towson, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Navy.\nIn the past, the Johns Hopkins lacrosse teams have represented the United States in international competition. Johns Hopkins represented the United States in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles where lacrosse was a demonstration sport, winning the tournament in 1932. Additionally, they won the 1974 World Lacrosse Championship in Melbourne, Australia, where they represented the United States.\nIn late 2012, the men's and women's lacrosse team facilities moved into the Cordish Lacrosse Center, located at the Charles Street (south) end of Homewood Field.\nThe Blue Jays were not selected for the 2013 NCAA tournament, the first such occurrence since 1971.\nOn May 17, 2013, President Ronald Daniels announced in an open letter to the Hopkins community that he was accepting the positive recommendation of a committee empaneled to explore seeking conference affiliation for the team.\nOn June 3, 2013, the university announced that the team would join a \"newly formulated\" Big Ten as an affiliate member for lacrosse, effective in the 2014–2015 season. This conference will consist of Hopkins, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State and Rutgers. On May 2, 2015, the Blue Jays won the inaugural Big Ten men's lacrosse championship, defeating the Ohio State Buckeyes 13–6.\nUp until 2016 the Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame, governed by US Lacrosse, was located on the Homewood campus adjacent to Homewood Field, the home for both the men's and women's lacrosse teams. It is currently located at the US Lacrosse headquarters in Sparks, Maryland.\nChampionships.\nStarting in 1926, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) began rating college lacrosse teams and awarding gold medals to the top teams. Johns Hopkins was the recipient of three of these, including in 1928 alongside Maryland, Navy, and Rutgers—each of which had only one regular-season collegiate defeat. From 1936 through 1970, the USILA awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the annual champion based on regular-season records. In 1971, the NCAA began hosting an annual men's tournament to determine the national champion. The Wingate Memorial Trophy was presented to the first two NCAA Division I champions (1971 and 1972) and was then retired.\nJohns Hopkins University men's highlights.\nCareer leaders are taken from the updated Johns Hopkins Record Book.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Johns Hopkins's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\nWilliam C. Schmeisser Award.\nThe William C. Schmeisser Award is an award given annually to the NCAA's most outstanding defenseman in men's college lacrosse. The award is presented by the USILA and is named after William C. \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser, a player and coach for Johns Hopkins University in the early 1900s.\nJack Turnbull Award.\nThe Lt. Col. J. I. Turnbull Award is named for Lt. Col. Jack Turnbull, a Blue Jays star, who died in World War II after his B-24 crashed while returning from a bombing run over Germany."

        "text": "The Hong Kong Open (currently respectively sponsored by Prudential and called the Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open (the WTA tournament); and sponsored by Bank of China (Hong Kong) and called the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open (the ATP tournament)) is a professional tennis tournament in Hong Kong SAR. Organised by the Hong Kong, China Tennis Association, the women's tournament is held annually during the Asian swing in early October in Victoria Park, Causeway Bay as a WTA 250 tournament; the men's tournament is held annually as a lead-up tournament to the Australian Open in early January as an ATP 250 tournament.\nThe Hong Kong Tennis Open was previously named the Salem Open that began in 1973 and discontinued in 2002. After a 21-year absence, the men's tournament resumed in January 2024. The women's tournament commenced in 1980 and was discontinued two years later. In 1993, the tournament returned for one year before being discontinued until 2014 where it has become a permanent fixture of the Asian swing on the WTA Tour.\nHistory.\nThe Hong Kong Open (also known as the Salem Open) was also previously a men's tennis tournament that was held in Hong Kong on the Grand Prix tour from (1973–1987) and the ATP Tour from (1990–2002). Players competed in the Victoria Park Tennis Centre, on outdoor hard courts. Michael Chang held the record number of wins with three titles.\nIn 2001, as with legislation restricting tobacco sponsorship, organizers controversially altered its official logo to include the logo of Perrier, causing anti-smoking campaigners to claim that the organizers exploited a loophole in its sponsorship clause.\nThe men's tournament was replaced in 2003 by the Thailand Open.\nA women's competition was also held in Hong Kong from 1980 to 1982; and then once more in 1993, as a Tier IV event on the WTA Tour. Wendy Turnbull won two titles in this competition. Beginning in 2014, the Hong Kong Tennis Open resumed after a two decade absence, sponsored by the Hong Kong-based insurance company Prudential. The tournament was honored as the WTA International Tournament of the Year in 2018.\nAfter the 2018 edition, the tournament was cancelled for 4 years due to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong in 2020 and 2021; and in 2022, due to concerns regarding the security and well-being of tennis player Peng Shuai after her allegations of sexual assault against Chinese Communist Party leader Zhang Gaoli. The latter led to all WTA events in China, including Hong Kong, being suspended indefinitely. In 2023, the WTA returned to Hong Kong and held its first edition since 2018 in 2023. \nAs announced by the Association of Tennis Professionals in June 2023, the ATP 250 license belonging to Pune, Maharashtra was relocated to Hong Kong. The first iteration of the tournament took place from 1–7 January on outdoor hard courts with a total prize money of more than $650,000. The tournament, sponsored by the Bank of China (Hong Kong), is expected to be a stop for players on their way to the Australian Open."

NC State defeated Maryland in overtime, 103–100, to win the championship. Tommy Burleson of NC State was named the tournament MVP.\nThe final pitted arguably the two best teams in the country and has long been regarded by many as the greatest ACC game in history and one of the greatest college games ever. The game was instrumental in forcing the expansion of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament to 32 teams, thus allowing more than one bid from a conference. That Maryland team, with six future NBA draft picks, is considered, by Bill Free of the Baltimore Sun newspaper, the greatest team that did not participate in the NCAA tournament.\nMany considered it the all-time greatest college basketball game until Duke pulled off a last-second overtime finish in the 1992 NCAA Division I East Regional final for a 104–103 win over Kentucky. \"I know they call the Duke–Kentucky game the greatest now,\" said Burleson in 1999 at a 25-year commemoration of the 1974 game, \"but we're still the greatest ACC game ever.\"\nNC State won the 1974 NCAA tournament, dethroning Bill Walton and seven-time defending national champion UCLA in the semifinals in another classic, before defeating Marquette in the final."

        "text": "Mike Morin (born July 20, 1971) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. Morin currently resides in Manchester, UK and is the Assistant Coach for the Manchester Storm.\nEarly career.\nBorn in Melville, Saskatchewan, Morin began his career at NCAA level, playing for Lake Superior State University. Morin was a regular and reliable first team player, icing in 165 games in four seasons and scoring 129 points in the process.\nMorin then made the transition to professional standard ice hockey, signing for the ECHL team, the Richmond Renegades. Again he would produce an excellent points output, with 38 points scored in just 47 appearances. Unfortunately the Renegades failed to qualify for the post-season. Morin would step up a level for the following season, 1995/96, and would line up as a Providence Bruins player. Although not a regular first teamer at the higher level, Morin would play 25 times during the regular season as well as making a handful of post-season appearances. In 1996, Morin would also briefly play roller hockey in the RHI for the San Jose Rhinos before returning to the more familiar ice surface for the following season.\nMove to UK Ice Hockey.\nManchester Storm.\nIt would be the 1996/97 season when Morin would make the decision to move to Europe, signing for the Manchester Storm, once the best supported ice hockey team in Europe. At the time the Storm were playing in the Ice Hockey Superleague, a newly established league which was proving popular with the fans. It was then the highest standard of ice hockey in Europe. Morin proved himself to be somewhat of an 'unsung hero' for the Storm, and through his hard work and dedication became one of the most important players on the team.\nMorin showed loyalty to the Storm, playing for them for six seasons in total, up until the end of the 2001/02 season when his contract was not renewed by then head coach Daryl Lipsey. Morin's work rate, effort and physical style combined with his loyalty to the organisation meant that he was firmly established as a 'fan favourite' in Manchester by the time of his departure, with many fans calling for a testimonial game.\nBNL and Sheffield Steelers.\nAfter his contract was not renewed, Morin took the opportunity to sign for the Hull Thunder, a team icing in the British National League, generally regarded as the league below the ISL. Morin's experience at the higher level served him well as he scored 17 points in 22 games. It would be a brief spell in the BNL for Morin as he would be signed, part way through the season by the ISL Sheffield Steelers. It was a move that many saw as controversial due to the intense rivalry between the Storm and the Steelers, often referred to as the 'War of the Roses'.\nManchester Phoenix.\nMorin was released by the Steelers in 2003, and was promptly re-signed with the newly established Manchester Phoenix organisation - he was in fact head coach Rick Brebant's first signing. The Phoenix had been established following the collapse of the Manchester Storm in 2003 due to off-ice financial problems. The 2003/04 season would be the Phoenix's first competitive season and it would be in the Elite Ice Hockey League, which was formed after the gradual meltdown of the ISL. Morin re-claimed his place as fan favourite in Manchester and was installed as alternate captain as a recognition for his years of service to ice hockey in Manchester. Morin is one of a handful of players to have played for both Manchester Storm and Manchester Phoenix.\nAt the end of the 2003/04 season, the Phoenix franchise would be temporarily suspended, again due to financial costs. This prompted Morin to declare his retirement from the game. Morin is still a widely popular figure in U.K. ice hockey, especially in Manchester, where he is regarded as one of the most respected players to play professional standard ice hockey in the city.\nMove into Coaching.\nOn 24 November 2015, it was announced that Morin would be returning to the Manchester Storm as Assistant Coach. Morin remains in this position as of the 2022/23 season.\nShirt Retirement.\nAt the end of the 2016/17 season, it was announced by the Manchester Storm organisation that Morin's number 15 shirt would be shirt retirement for services to Manchester Storm both as a player and assistant coach. The shirt retirement took place on 12 November 2017 prior to a match against Milton Keynes Lightning."

He was drafted by the Broncos in the seventh round of the 1988 NFL Draft. He played in 44 games over 4 seasons, starting only the 1988 AFC Championship due to an injury to starter Clarence Kay. Kelly also played in Super Bowl XXIV. He died of cancer on March 28, 2003.\nEarly years.\nKelly attended R. L. Thomas High School in Webster, New York, before heading to Syracuse, New York to play with the Syracuse Orange football team. Head Coach Greg Robinson said of him, \n...There was Pat Kelly. Pat Kelly – what a character. This guy was as bright as they came. He was at the Jets, and at the Broncos, went on and was doing a wonderful job on Wall Street. Pat was the kind of guy who he could turn a locker room because of the way he could disrupt it with his sense of humor. He could take over a whole football team. He was a guy who everybody not only remembered as a player, but also as a person. Sadly, we lost Pat not too long ago. He is always remembered for what he was – a special person.\n Kelly also won the Zunic Award, which is given annually to anyone who exhibits the courage and spirit of Mike and Judy Zunic. More specifically, it usually signifies overcoming a severe injury.\nAfter football.\nAfter leaving the NFL, Kelly became a successful businessman. This led to him co-creating the Joshua Frase Foundation in the fall of 1996, a foundation devoted to raising funds for research into Centronuclear myopathy and related congenital myopathies, with friend and former Syracuse/New York Jets teammate Paul Frase. Frase's son Joshua, whom the foundation is named for, suffered from centronuclear myopathy and died on December 24, 2010, at the age of 15. Kelly also created the JFF Muscle Dream Team Gala and helped raise millions of dollars for the foundation."

        "text": "The Illinois Men's Volleyball Club is a registered student organization at the University of Illinois that plays men's volleyball. This team is composed of students from the University of Illinois and is designated as a club team because the University does not have a varsity men's volleyball team. The club is based at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and is a member of the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. The club is divided into three teams divided according to level of competitiveness. All teams in the club compete only in tournaments and there are no lone matches unless they are specially scheduled. The Illinois Men's Volleyball Club was established in 1984 and quickly became one of the top collegiate men's club volleyball teams in the nation. The team has been ranked among the top ten club teams in the nation since 1997. The club placed third in the nation in 2003, 2005, and 2007 and second in 2004. Additionally, the Illinois Men's Volleyball Club hosts an annual tournament in Champaign, Illinois called the Illini 16 and co-hosts the Hoosier-Illini Classic with Indiana University. Additionally, the club hosted an exhibition match for the Blue and Orange teams for the first time in 2008. The Blue team played Purdue University while the Orange team played Illinois State University.\nOrganization.\nThe Illinois Men's Volleyball Club consists of three teams of varying competitiveness and time commitment. The first team is the 1s Team and is considered to be the best team. This team competes in Division One of the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association and generally participates in about twelve tournaments a year including the national tournament. The 2s Team is considered the second team and competes in Division 3 of the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. This team participates in about eight tournaments a year. All 3 teams travel to the national championships hosted by the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association. This tournament hosts only club teams from within the United States and no NCAA varsity men's volleyball teams. . This team competes in the Midwest Collegiate Volleyball Association.

The current officer positions are President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. The club does not have a coach and each team is instead led by a player who is chosen to be the captain. The club is supported by dues paid by every club member and through funding provided by the University's student organization fund. Additionally, fundraising events are held including a T-shirt sale. The club also receives funds from the University of Illinois because it is registered as a student organization.

        "text": "The Punch line was a famous ice hockey line for the Montreal Canadiens in the 1940s. It consisted of Elmer Lach at center, Toe Blake on left wing, and Maurice Richard on the right side.\nDuring their time together, they led the Canadiens to two Stanley Cup victories. During the 1944–45 NHL season, the three finished first (Lach), second (Richard), and third (Blake) in scoring for the league. They would also form the forward line for the first all-star team in that same season. Richard would be the first team all-star right wing for all but one year while with Blake and Lach.\nHistory.\nIn the 1943–44 season, Montreal head coach Dick Irvin tried a line combination of Lach at centre, Maurice Richard on the right wing, and Toe Blake at left. This line became known as the Punch line and dominated the NHL for four seasons. In the first season of the Punch line, Lach played 48 games, scoring on average an assist per game; he also added 24 goals. At the conclusion of the season, Lach was named to the second All-Star team. He also won his first Stanley Cup, helping sweep the Chicago Black Hawks in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nIn the 1944–45 season, Lach played in all 50 games, picking up a league-leading 80 points, of which 26 were goals and 54 were assists. That season, linemate Maurice Richard became the first player in the NHL to score 50 goals in 50 games. That season, the Punch line amassed 220 points in total, an NHL record until the 1960s. Lach was presented the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's Most Valuable Player, and was named to the first All-Star team, with Blake and Richard joining him.\nAfter being eliminated by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the semi-finals in the previous season, Lach and the Canadiens won another Stanley Cup in the 1945–46 season. Lach led all players with 34 regular season assists, and was named once more to the second All-Star team. In the 1947–48 season, Lach became the first recipient of the Art Ross Trophy, after leading the league in points, with 61. The Punch line ceased to exist after Blake retired at the end of the season. All three members have been in the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1966, when Blake and Lach joined Richard, an inductee five years prior (1961). Blake would retire after the 1947–48 NHL season, but would later coach Richard on the famed Canadiens teams of the late 1950s that won five Stanley Cups in a row. Lach and Richard would later both set the record for most points in a career. Blake also was the Canadiens' coach for eight of the record eleven Cups won by Maurice Richard's younger brother, Henri."

Later, the ICC banned Collingwood for four ODI matches due to England's slow over rate, with England having bowled only 47 overs in the required time. The ICC also fined the rest of the English team 15% of their match fee. Kevin Pietersen was called upon to take over as captain for the final game."

Thomas took up ice hockey much later than most players but was able to thrive due to his natural talent and physical abilities. Thomas began playing junior ice hockey after watching his local team, the now defunct Manchester Storm, then playing in the ISL.\nDuring his first season, Thomas played in 22 games and totaled 63 penalty minutes as well as helping out the offence with seven points. For the start of the 2003–04 season Thomas was a Telford Wildfoxes player but played just once before being traded by the Manchester Phoenix head coach, Rick Brebant, to play for the Phoenix in their debut season.\nThomas played in 52 EIHL regular season games and featured six times in the play-offs. The Phoenix organisation was suspended in 2004 due to off-ice problems. In the summer of 2004, Thomas signed with the London Racers, where he stayed for a season-and-a-half. The Racers franchise folded mid-way through the 2005–06 season.\nThis mid-season move brought Thomas to sign for the Sheffield Steelers, arch-rivals of the Phoenix whom Thomas had played for just two years earlier. Thomas established himself as a key part of the Steelers defence, and was a rare British star player surrounded by foreign imports. It was that consistency that saw \"Tomo\" remain a fan favourite with the Steelers organisation for 10 seasons, and in 2015, he was rewarded with a testimonial season.\nVarious events were held in his testimonial year, including a testimonial match which saw many former Steelers, including Scott Basiuk and Steve Munn, return to Sheffield.\nOn 6 May 2015, it was announced that Thomas was returning to his hometown team, the EPL's Manchester Phoenix, who he had previously played for in their inaugural season in 2003–04."

        "text": "The Cornell Big Red men's basketball team represents Cornell University (one of eight members of the Ivy League), located in Ithaca, New York, in NCAA Division I men's competition. The Big Red's appearance in the 2008 NCAA Tournament was their first trip to \"The Big Dance\" since 1988, ending a 20 year absence from the tournament. The team has reached the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament five times, in 1954, 1988, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Cornell’s best finish in the NCAA tournament occurred in 1954 and 2010 when they advanced to the Sweet 16. Jon Jaques is the current head coach.\nHistory.\nCornell played its first basketball game on December 13, 1898, a 48–12 victory over the Waverly YMCA. The team would finish the short season with a record of 1–3. The program did not record a winning season until 1908–1909 when the team went 13–10. Beginning with the 1901–1902 season and ending with the 1954–1955 season Cornell competed in the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League which at various points in its history consisted of between four and eight schools, all of whom would eventually join the Ivy League upon its creation in 1954. Cornell won the EIBL title four times, including 1954 in a one-game playoff over Princeton which would earn the Big Red their first trip to the NCAA tournament. The 1955–56 season was the first year of competition under the new Ivy League organization. Cornell has since won the Ivy League title four times, most recently in 2010. That year marked the first time Cornell would win a game in the NCAA tournament.\nCornell moved into their current home, Newman Arena in Bartels Hall in January 1990. From February 16, 1919 home games had been played in Barton Hall, originally referred to simply as the \"New Armory\". Earlier games had been played in the previous armory which was located on what is now the engineering quad.\nAll-time postseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe 2010 tournament was the Big Red's fifth appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Their combined record is 2–6.\nIn 2010, the men's basketball team defeated fifth-seeded Temple followed by fourth-seeded Wisconsin to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, becoming the first Ivy League team to advance that far since Penn's Final Four appearance in 1979. The win over Temple marked the first time Cornell ever won a game in the NCAA tournament.\nNational Invitation Tournament (NIT) results.\nCornell has been selected to participate in one National Invitation Tournament.

        "title": "1948 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1948 Ashes series was that year's edition of the long-standing cricket rivalry between England and Australia. Starting on 10 June 1948, England and Australia played five Tests. Australia had not lost a Test since the Second World War and were strong favourites. Their captain Don Bradman had publicly expressed his ambition of going through the tour without defeat, and Australia won 10 of their 12 lead-up matches, eight by an innings. The England team, however, had several notable players themselves, including Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Alec Bedser. Nevertheless, the final result was a 4–0 series win for Australia, with the Third Test being drawn. They thus retained The Ashes. The Australians remained undefeated for their entire tour of England, earning them the sobriquet of \"The Invincibles\".\nThe First Test set the trend for the series as England's batsmen struggled against the Australian pace attack and, despite attempting to stifle the Australian scoring with leg theory, fell to an eventual defeat. Failure to contain the Australian batsmen, particularly Bradman himself, plagued the English bowlers, while their batsmen were prone to struggling and collapsing on key occasions, with rain petering the Third Test into a draw. The series saw a number of notable cricketing feats, including a 301-run partnership between Bradman and Arthur Morris, aided by many dropped catches and missed stumpings, during the Fourth Test, and Australia's heaviest win of the series in the Fifth Test, where England were bowled out for 52 in half a day. Australia then made 389, with Bradman making a famous duck in his final innings. England were then bowled out for 188 to lose by an innings and 149 runs in less than three days' playing time.\nMatch details.\nFirst Test, 10–15 June.\nSince the Second World War, Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten. In early 1946, they defeated New Zealand in a one-off Test by an innings. The following season, in 1946–47, they won the five-Test series against England 3–0, and followed this with a 4–0 series win over India in the following season. Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England, and Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat. Prior to the First Test, Australia had played 12 first-class matches, winning ten and drawing two. Eight of the victories were by an innings, and another was by eight wickets. One of the drawn matches, against Lancashire was rain-affected with the first day washed out entirely.\nIt was thought that Bradman would play Ring, but he changed his mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. England lost leg spinner Wright before the match due to lumbago.\nThe first innings of the First Test set the pattern of the series as the England top-order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break on the first day due to inclement weather, but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton with a faster ball. During the interval, heavy rain fell, making the ball skid through upon resumption. Washbrook was out after the luncheon interval, caught on the run by Brown at fine leg after attempting to hook Lindwall. At 15/2, Compton came to the crease, and together with Edrich, they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring, caught by Miller in slips, an effort described by \"Wisden\" as \"dazzling\". Two runs later, Compton was bowled attempting a leg sweep from the bowling of Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board. Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again in the match. Johnston bowled Barnett for eight and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74, England was facing the prospect of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, the current record being 112. Laker and Bedser, both from Surrey, scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by hooking, while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket. Bedser was removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63 in 101 minutes, with six boundaries. Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing. Miller took 3/38 and a catch.\nAustralia had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted the players on the second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.\nLaker to this point had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day. Yardley set a defensive field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman. Yardley took Laker out of the attack and took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes but the run rate remained low. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brown leg before wicket in his first over. Hassett came in at 185/4 and Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets.\nOn the third morning, Bradman resumed on 130, before progressing to 132 and becoming the first player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season. His innings was soon terminated at 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and Johnson replaced him with Australia at 305/5. Johnson made 21 before being bowled by Laker, and Tallon took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left arm orthodox spin of Young. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. Lindwall came out to bat at 365/7 without a runner and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting, striking 20 fours and a six. The partnership was terminated when Bedser struck Hassett's off stump. Lindwall was caught by Evans down the leg side four runs later, but Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser trapped Toshack lbw to end the innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners, with Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113.\nAt the start of England's second innings, Miller removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot. Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson, leaving England 39/2. This brought together England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. Nevertheless, the English had the better of the late afternoon period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes, including one 14-run over bowled by Miller where Hutton struck consecutive boundaries. The third day was followed by a rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning, a Monday. The Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club secretary, H. A. Brown, broadcast an appeal to the gallery to refrain from their heckling of Miller on the third day.\nHutton resumed on 63 and he and Compton progressed before the light deteriorated. An unsuccessful appeal against the light was quickly followed by a thunderstorm, which stopped proceedings. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending a 111-run partnership at 150/3. The innings was then interrupted by poor light and upon the resumption, poor visibility intervened for a second time with Compton on 97. After 55 minutes of delay, the umpires called for the resumption. \"Wisden\" opined that \"rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day\". Hardstaff supported Compton in a partnership of 93 before being removed by Toshack, and Barnett was removed by Johnston for six with the score having progressed a further 17 runs to 264/5. Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge, aided by a 57-run partnership with his captain before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22. England reached stumps at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10.\nCompton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning, which was briefly interrupted twice by rain. Miller bowled a fast bouncer at Compton, who moved into position to hook before changing his mind and attempting to evade the ball. He lost balance and fell onto his wicket. He was out hit wicket for 184. He had batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours. \"Wisden\" opined that \"No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances\". Compton's fall at 405/7 exposed the bowlers and Australia quickly finished off the innings within half an hour. Miller bowled Laker, Evans reached 50 and was caught behind from Johnston, who then castled Young. England finished at 441 after 183 overs, leaving Australia a target of 98. Lindwall's absence meant that the remaining four frontline bowlers had to bowl more than 32 overs each—Johnston bowled 59 and ended with 4/147 while Miller took 4/125 from 44 overs. Australia progressed steadily to 38 before Bedser bowled Morris for nine and then dismissed Bradman for a duck, again caught by Hutton at short fine leg. This left Australia 48/2. However, Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, being prolific on the square cut. Barnes tied the scores with a boundary, but ran off the field with a souvenir stump believing that the match was over. He returned to the field when he noticed the crowd reaction and Hassett hit the winning run.\nSecond Test, 24–29 June.\nAustralian retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. On the other hand, England made three changes; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox of Young, all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5. batsman. Hardstaff had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, while Barnett managed only eight and six. Following his injury in the previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations was sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover before bowling. Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.\nThe debutant Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Hutton at short fine leg from a short delivery, leaving Australia 3/1. Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings, taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser. Hutton had dropped Bradman in the same position when the Australian captain was on 13. In the meantime, Morris, after a slow start, made 105 runs out of a total of 166 scored while he was at the wicket, including 14 fours and one six. His innings was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. He was out after hitting Coxon to Hutton in the gully, leaving Australia at 166/3. Miller came in and Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers to him. A fourth ball swung the other way, with Miller not offering a shot. He was given out leg before wicket for four. Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings after the two quick wickets of Morris and Miller. Both scored slowly, taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley bowled him and then trapped Brown lbw in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225/6. Edrich had Johnson caught behind for four and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258/7.\nAustralia's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 275/8, Tallon kept on batting, supported by Johnston and Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29— before becoming Bedser's second victim for the morning. Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston was stumped from Wright's leg spin. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail were dealing well with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs.\nLindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. He had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over. Hutton then played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, dismissing him for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the over to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker put on a 41-run stand for the eight wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.\nOn the third morning, Bedser inside-edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax. The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity when he was 18 and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122. Morris was then bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket. Barnes started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Once he reached his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, included two successive blows over the boundary for six. He was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary from Yardley. He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings. The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296/2 after 277 minutes when he departed. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 296/3 to face Yardley's hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich at slip. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 and Australia reached stumps at 343, without further loss, with Miller having struck one six into the grandstand.\nAfter the rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run partnership with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was noted for its driving and when he was out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each.\nFurther showers breathed extra life into the pitch, and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Miller dropped Hutton from Lindwall's bowling before he had scored and played and missed multiple times. Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far, before Hutton edged Lindwall to Johnson and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, before Toshack removed both in quick succession to leave England at 65/3. However, Compton and Dollery added 41 in the last 30 minutes to have England close at 106/3.\nThe final day started poorly for England, with Compton edging Johnston to a diving Miller at second slip from the second ball of the day. England had lost a wicket without adding to their overnight total. Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former. He then trapped Coxon lbw two balls later in the same over. Eight runs later, Dollery shaped to duck a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Toshack ended the innings with 5/40, while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively. The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were £43,000 – a record for a Test in England.&lt;ref name=\"Allen p136/37\"&gt;Allen, pp. 106–7. A report by RJ Hayter.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThird Test, 8–13 July.\nWhen the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. The omission generated considerable controversy. The Australians were pleased, feeling that Hutton was England's best batsman. Hutton's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett. England made three further changes. Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department, thereby reverting from two spinners to one. Coxon, who made his debut in the previous match and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by debutant batsman Crapp. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings, with the all rounder Loxton. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.\nThe change in England's opening pair did not result in an improvement on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball, and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. With 22 runs on the board, Johnston bowled Washbrook with a yorker, and six runs later, Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves. Lindwall bowled a series of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting, resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added. They reached lunch at 57/2. Upon the resumption, Crapp began to accelerate, hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson. Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37. Dollery took a single to get off the mark but then missed a yorker from Johnston and was bowled. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. After 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught behind. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. Yardley fell to Toshack for 22 with the score at 141/6, bringing Evans to the crease. Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans to leave England 216/7.\nEngland resumed on the second day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and featuring in a 121-run partnership with Compton before he was run out. Soon after, Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. Toshack then bowled Pollard and Young was caught from Johnston's bowling as England were bowled out for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl and the remaining four frontline bowlers sent down at least 38 overs each.\nHaving dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He was unable to make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, and Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett was beaten in flight by Young and was caught by Washbrook. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.\nAustralia had added only nine runs on the third morning when Pollard trapped Miller for 31 with the new ball. Four runs later, Morris had reached 51 when Bedser removed him, leaving Australia 139/5. Barnes came out to bat at 135/4, despite having collapsed while practising in the nets due to the aftereffects of the blow to his chest. He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before it became too much and he had to be taken from the ground and sent to the hospital to be put under observation. Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon was caught behind from Edrich. Lindwall came into bat at 172/6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on. He then received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled by Pollard, leaving Australia 208/7, five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.\nLindwall removed Emmett for a duck at the start of the second innings, bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing that it would be interpreted as retaliation and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. However, Miller did retaliate with a series of bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and order him to stop. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided by the Australian fielders, who twice dropped Washbrook at long leg and once in the slips cordon. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris, who threw down the stumps from cover. Toshack removed Compton for a duck, leaving England at 125/3. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, as England reached 174 at the close without further loss, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.\nThe rest day was followed by the fourth day, which was abandoned due to persistent rain. Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day, leaving Australia a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire first session was lost. Young removed Johnson for six to leave Australia 10/1, but the tourists thereafter batted safely in a defensive manner to ensure a draw. They ended at 92/1 in 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, which was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series. The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test.\nFourth Test, 22–27 July.\nAustralia made two changes for the Test. Harvey replaced the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on debut and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position. Laker, the off spinner, replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.\nEngland won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch. Hutton and Washbrook put on an opening partnership of 168, the best by England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the hook shot, which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall. Washbrook reached his century with the score on 189. Joined by Edrich, the pair batted until late in the first day, when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day. His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs. Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived the last four balls as England closed without further addition to score at 268/2, with Edrich on 41.\nThe next day, Bedser batted on in steady support of Edrich. The pair saw England to lunch without further loss, and 155 runs were added for the third wicket before Bedser was out in the second session after almost three hours of batting. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test career best 79 before returning a catch to the off spin of Johnson. Edrich fell to Johnson after three further runs were added with the score at 426/4. He had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six. With two new batsmen at the crease, Australia quickly made further inroads. Toshack bowled Crapp for five and after Compton and Yardley added 26 for the sixth wicket, the former edged Lindwall and Saggers had his first Test catch to leave England at 473/6. Playing in his first Test of the summer, Loxton then successively removed Cranston, Evans and Laker as England fell from 486/6 to 496/9. Miller then bowled the English skipper Yardley to end England's innings at 496. The home side had batted for 192.1 overs and lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs. Loxton took 3/55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two. Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury. With Barnes injured, Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris. Bedser removed Morris for six with the new ball, to leave Australia at 13/1, before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63/1. Bradman did the majority of the scoring in the late afternoon, finishing unbeaten on 31 in a partnership of 40.\nOn the third morning, England made the ideal start when Pollard removed both of the established batsmen in his opening over. He removed Hassett for 13 and two balls later bowled Bradman for 33. This left Australia struggling at 68/3. Harvey, playing his first Ashes Test, joined Miller at the crease. Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner \"Let's get stuck into 'em\". If England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking substantial lead. The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted Laker's first ball over square leg for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as he was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him. Miller struck consecutive sixes over long off and the sightscreen respectively. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker. Miller then lifted another six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head, and another over long on from Yardley's bowling. He was dismissed by Yardley for 58 attempting another six, when an edge bounced off Evans' head and was caught by a diving Edrich at short fine leg.\nThe partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes, likened by \"Wisden\" to a \"hurricane\". Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut, scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket. The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match back from England's firm control. Loxton was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours. Harvey fell at 294/5 and Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 329/6, both dismissed by Laker.\nAustralia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, while Saggers only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker. This left Australia at 355/8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77, an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. Of the 103 added for the last two wickets, Johnston and Toshack managed only 25 between them. Lindwall was the last man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Australia added only one run to its overnight score of 457/9, with Bedser taking the final wicket to end with 3/92. Laker took 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each.\nEngland set about extending their first innings lead for the remainder of the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. Johnston removed Washbrook for 65 before Johnson removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, leaving England at 129/2. Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off, adding 103 for the third wicket before Lindwall trapped Edrich for 54. Crapp came in and added 18 before Lindwall bowled him at 260/4 and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley made seven before Johnston removed him. Johnston then removed Cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, caught by Miller, England were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining. They had lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller removed the latter. Laker then helped Evans to add a further 32 as England reached 362/8 at the close of the fourth day.\nEngland batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.\nThis left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. When Laker was introduced to exploit the spin, 13 runs were taken from his first over, but only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against the spin for a boundary. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121/1. In the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Australia had given chances, but England failed to seize them. Evans failed to stump Morris when he was on 32, and Crapp dropped Bradman from Compton.\nUpon resumption, Morris severely attacked Compton, who had been bowling in an attempt to exploit the spin, aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs. This prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with pacemen. Australia reached 202, halfway to the required total, with 165 minutes left. When Bradman suffered a fibrositis attack, Morris had to shield him from the strike until it subsided. Morris passed his century, and was then given another life on 126 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg. Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 288/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 167 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours. The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds. The attendance remains a record for a Test in England.\nFifth Test, England v Australia.\nWith the series already lost, England made four changes to their team. Dewes replaced Washbrook, who was suffering from a thumb injury, at the top of the order. Watkins replaced Cranston as the middle order batsman and bowler. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut. England played two spinners; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker, while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard. The selectors were widely condemned for their changes. Australia made three changes. Having taken only seven wickets in the first four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured Toshack was replaced by the recovered Barnes, meaning that Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury.\nThe match saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week leading up to the match meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. The damp conditions meant that sawdust had to be added in large amounts to allow the players to keep their grip. The humid conditions, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers, with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights.\nMiller bowled Dewes for one with his second ball to leave England at 2/1, before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10/2. Lindwall dismissed Compton after Morris had taken a diving catch, and Miller then removed Crapp without scoring after a 23-ball innings, leaving England at 23/4.\nAfter the lunch break, England had struggled to 35/4, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker. The debutant Watkins then batted for 16 balls without scoring before Johnston trapped him for a duck to leave England at 42/6. For his troubles, Watkins also collected a bruise on the shoulder that inhibited his bowling later in the match. Lindwall then removed Evans, Bedser and Young, all yorked in the space of two runs. The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket-keeper Tallon, who grasped the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs, taking five wickets for eight runs, finishing with 6/20 in 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as \"the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket\". Hutton was the only batsman to resist, scoring 30 in 124 minutes and surviving 147 deliveries. The next most resilient display was from Yardley, who scored seven runs in 31 minutes of resistance, facing 33 balls. Miller and Johnston took 2/5 and 2/20 respectively, and Australia's pace trio removed all the batsmen without Bradman having to call on Ring for a bowl.\nIn contrast, Australia batted with apparent ease, and Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves. The score had reached 117 before Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The opening stand had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 6 pm late on the first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Hassett came in at 117/2 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four.\nOn the second morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five and Harvey 17, both falling to Hollies as Australia progressed to 265/5. Loxton accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before Edrich removed him for 15. Young removed Lindwall for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he had attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man but was not agile enough for the substitute fielder's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out on 389, ending Australia's innings. Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two spinners.\nEngland started their second innings 337 runs in arrears. Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Crapp for 10 to leave England 20/1. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the innings to close at the end of the second day on 54/1 due to bad light.\nEarly on the third day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 with the score at 64, before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip. Hutton managed to continue resisting the Australians before Miller struck Crapp in the head with a bouncer. Hutton then edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring dismissed debutant Watkins for two to take his only wicket. Lindwall returned and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in the fading light, and the umpires called off play due to bad light. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.\nEngland resumed on the fourth morning with only three wickets in hand and still 159 runs in arrears. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added, with Hollies being removed for a golden duck, skying a ball to Morris, immediately after Yardley was the ninth man to fall. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. This result sealed the series 4–0 in favour of Australia. The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches.\nRecords and statistical analysis.\nAs Australia won the series convincingly 4–0, it is not surprising that their players dominated the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs at a much higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were a large part of the success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1982 followed the system in place since 1978. \nThe Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected two, Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected the second Commissioner of Baseball, Happy Chandler, and former New York Giants shortstop Travis Jackson. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 1, 1982, with the current Commissioner of Baseball, Bowie Kuhn, presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1962 or later, but not after 1976; the ballot included candidates from the 1981 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1976. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 1982 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 13. The ballot consisted of 42 players; a total of 415 ballots were cast, with 312 votes required for election. A total of 3,344 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.06 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".
