        "title": "List of Australia Test cricket records",
        "text": "Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level. A Test match is scheduled to take place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Australia was a founding member of the ICC having played the first Test match against England in March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. They have played a total of 849 matches, second only to England who have played just over 1,000. , Australia is the most successful team in Test cricket with an overall winning percentage of 47.58, ahead of their nearest rival South Africa on 38.20.\nTop order batsman and former captain Don Bradman holds several batting records. Considered to be the greatest batsman of all time, he played 52 Tests between 1928 and 1948. He holds the record for the highest Test average of 99.94, has scored the most Test double centuries with 12, the equal most Test triple centuries with 2 and the most runs scored in a series with 974 during the 1930 Ashes series. He also holds the highest fifth-wicket partnership with Sid Barnes with 405 runs, set during the 1946–47 Ashes series, the oldest of the wicket partnerships records. A further two Australian partnership records for the second and the sixth wickets set by Bradman still stand.\nShane Warne, regarded as one of the best bowlers in the history of the game, holds several Test records. He held the record for the most Test wickets with 708 until December 2007 when Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan passed Warne's milestone. Warne is second only to Muralitharan in taking the most five-wicket hauls in an innings and the most ten-wicket hauls in a Test match. Glenn McGrath, who took 563 wickets in his career, is third to England's James Anderson and Stuart Broad for the most wickets taken by a fast bowler in Test cricket. Adam Gilchrist is Australia's most successful wicket-keeper having taken 416 dismissals. He is second only to South Africa's Mark Boucher with 555 to his name. Allan Border, who made his Test debut in 1978 and captained Australia from 1984 until his retirement in 1994, holds the Australian record for the most consecutive matches played with 153 and the record for the most matches played as skipper for Australia with 93.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for Australia only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nTeam wins, losses, draws and ties.\n, Australia has played 859 Test matches resulting in 408 victories, 231 defeats, 217 draws and 2 ties for an overall winning percentage of 47.49, the highest winning percentage of Test playing teams. Australia has played the second-highest number of Test matches, behind England who have competed in 1,058. Australia has never lost or drawn a match against Zimbabwe, the only team to do so. Australia is also the only team to win their debut Test match with every other team losing their first Test except Zimbabwe who drew against India.\nTeam scoring records.\nMost runs in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored in Test cricket came in the series between Sri Lanka and India in August 1997. Playing in the first Test at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the hosts posted a first innings total of 6/952d. This broke the longstanding record of 7/903d which England set against Australia in the final Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval. The fifth Test of the 1954–55 series against the West Indies saw Australia set their highest innings total of 8/758d, the eighth-highest score in Test cricket.\nHighest successful run chases.\nAustralia's highest successful run chase in Test cricket came in the fourth Test of the 1948 Ashes series at Headingley. Australia reached the target of 404 runs with seven wickets in hand. This was a Test record at the time of posting and remained so until May 2003 when the West Indies defeated Australia at the Antigua Recreation Ground. Set 418 for victory in the final innings, the hosts achieved the target for the loss of seven wickets.\nFewest runs in an innings.\nThe lowest innings total scored in Test cricket came in the second Test of England's tour of New Zealand in March 1955. Trailing England by 46, New Zealand was bowled out in their second innings for 26 runs. The equal fifth-lowest score in Test history is Australia's total of 36 scored in their first innings against England in the first Test of the 1902 Ashes series.\nResult records.\nA Test match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by innings).\nThe fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval saw England win by an innings and 579 runs, the largest victory by an innings in Test cricket history. The next largest victory was Australia's win against South Africa in the first Test of the 2001–02 tour at the Wanderers Stadium, where the tourists won by an innings and 360 runs.\nGreatest win margins (by runs).\nThe greatest winning margin by runs in Test cricket was England's victory over Australia by 675 runs in the first Test of the 1928–29 Ashes series. The next two largest victories were recorded by Australia including defeat over England in the final Test of the 1934 Ashes series by 562 runs.\nGreatest win margins (by 10 wickets).\nAustralia have won a Test match by a margin of 10 wickets on 30 occasions, more than any other Test playing team.\nNarrowest win margins (by runs).\nAustralia's narrowest win by runs was against England in the fourth Test of the 1902 Ashes series at Old Trafford. Set 124 runs for victory in the final innings, England were bowled all out for 120 to give victory to Australia by three runs. This was the equal third-narrowest win in Test cricket, with the narrowest being the West Indies' one-run win over Australia in 1993.\nNarrowest win margins (by wickets).\nAustralia's narrowest win by wickets came in the fourth Test of the West Indies tour of Australia in 1951–52. Played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the hosts won the match by a margin of one wicket, one of only fifteen one-wicket victories in Test cricket.\nGreatest loss margins (by innings).\nThe Oval in London played host the greatest defeat by an innings in Test cricket. The final Test of the 1938 Ashes saw England defeat the tourists by an innings and 579 runs, to the draw the series at one match all.\nGreatest loss margins (by runs).\nThe first Test of the 1928–29 Ashes series saw Australia defeated by England by 675 runs, the greatest losing margin by runs in Test cricket. The match was played at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, the first of only two Test matches contested at the venue.\nGreatest loss margins (by 10 wickets).\nAustralia have lost a Test match by a margin of 10 wickets on 10 occasions.\nNarrowest loss margins (by runs).\nOnly one match in years of Test cricket has been decided by a margin of one run, the fourth Test of the West Indian tour of Australia in 1992–93 playing for the Frank Worrell Trophy. Contested at Adelaide Oval, Australia was set 186 runs for victory in the final innings. With just two runs left to score, Australia's number eleven batsman Craig McDermott was caught behind off the bowling of Courtney Walsh, to give the victory to the tourists.\nNarrowest loss margins (by wickets).\nTest cricket has seen fifteen matches been decided by a margin of one wicket, with Australia being defeated in six of them. The first of these was the final Test of the 1902 Ashes series at The Oval where England ran down the target of 263 runs in the final innings. The most recent occurring during the 2019 Ashes series against England. The third Test at Headingley saw the hosts achieving their highest successful run chase in Test cricket of 359 runs.\nTied matches.\nA tie can occur when the scores of both teams are equal at the conclusion of play, provided that the side batting last has completed their innings. Only two matches have ended in a tie in Test cricket history, both of which involved Australia.\nBatting records.\nMost career runs.\nA run is the basic means of scoring in cricket. A run is scored when the batsman hits the ball with his bat and with his partner runs the length of of the pitch.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs in Test cricket with 15,921. Second is Ricky Ponting of Australia with 13,378 ahead of Jacques Kallis from South Africa in third with 13,289. Allan Border and Steve Waugh are the only other Australian batsmen who have scored more than 10,000 runs in Test cricket.\nHighest individual score.\nThe first Test of the 2003–04 series of the Southern Cross Trophy, contested between Australia and Zimbabwe, at the WACA Ground saw Matthew Hayden of Australia set the highest individual Test innings score with 380, surpassing Brian Lara's 375 scored against England in April 1994 at the Antigua Recreation Ground. Six months after Hayden set the record, the West Indian claimed it back scoring 400 not out against the same opposition and on the same ground.\nHighest career average.\nA batsman's batting average is the total number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been dismissed.\nAustralia's Don Bradman, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time, finished his Test career with an average of 99.94. Adam Voges who retired in 2016, has the second-best career average in Test cricket with 61.87. , the currently active Steve Smith with an average of 60.89, is fourth.\nMost half-centuries.\nA half-century is a score of between 50 and 99 runs. Statistically, once a batsman's score reaches 100, it is no longer considered a half-century but a century.\nSachin Tendulkar of India has scored the most half-centuries in Test cricket with 68. He is followed by the West Indies' Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 66, India's Rahul Dravid and Allan Border of Australia on 63 and in fifth with 62 fifties to his name, Australia's Ricky Ponting.\nMost centuries.\nA century is a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings.\nTendulkar has also scored the most centuries in Test cricket with 51. South Africa's Jacques Kallis is next on 45 and Ricky Ponting with 41 hundreds is in third.\nMost double centuries.\nA double century is a score of 200 or more runs in a single innings.\nBradman holds the Test record for the most double centuries scored with twelve, one ahead of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara who finished his career with eleven. In third is Brian Lara of the West Indies with nine. England's Wally Hammond, India's Virat Kohli and Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka have all scored seven and Ponting is one of six cricketers who reached the mark on six occasions.\nMost triple centuries.\nA triple century is a score of 300 or more runs in a single innings.\nBradman holds the equal Test record for the most triple centuries scored with two, along with India's Virender Sehwag and West Indians Chris Gayle and Brian Lara. Six Australians have scored a single Test triple century with former vice-captain David Warner the most recent to do so in 2019, .\nMost runs in a series.\nThe 1930 Ashes series in England saw Bradman set the record for the most runs scored in a single series, falling just 26 short of 1,000 runs. He is followed by Wally Hammond with 905 runs scored in the 1928–29 Ashes series. Mark Taylor with 839 in the 1989 Ashes and Neil Harvey with 834 in 1952–53 South African series are third and fourth on the list, respectively.\nMost ducks.\nA duck refers to a batsman being dismissed without scoring a run. Glenn McGrath has scored the fourth-highest number of ducks in Test cricket behind Courtney Walsh with 43, the recently retired Stuart Broad with 39 and Chris Martin with 36.\nBowling records.\nMost career wickets.\nA bowler takes the wicket of a batsman when the form of dismissal is bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket. If the batsman is dismissed by run out, obstructing the field, handling the ball, hitting the ball twice or timed out the bowler does not receive credit.\nShane Warne held the record for the most Test wickets with 708 until December 2007 when Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan passed Warne's milestone. Muralitharan, who continued to play until 2010, finished with 800 wickets to his name. James Anderson of England is third with 675 Test wickets to his name , overtaking Australia's Glenn McGrath in September 2018 to become the fast bowler with the most Test wickets. India's Anil Kumble is fourth on the list taking 619 wickets. Stuart Broad with 566 wickets moved into fifth in September 2022 after becoming the second fast bowler to overtake McGrath's total of 563 wickets.\nBest figures in an innings.\nBowling figures refers to the number of the wickets a bowler has taken and the number of runs conceded.\nThere have been three occasions in Test cricket where a bowler has taken all 10 wickets in a single innings – Jim Laker of England took 10/53 against Australia in 1956, India's Anil Kumble in 1999 returned figures of 10/74 against Pakistan and in 2021 Ajaz Patel of New Zealand took 10/119 against India. Arthur Mailey is one of 16 bowlers who have taken nine wickets in a Test match innings.\nBest figures in a match.\nA bowler's bowling figures in a match is the sum of the wickets taken and the runs conceded over both innings.\nNo bowler in the history of Test cricket has taken all 20 wickets in a match. The closest to do so was English spin bowler Jim Laker. During the fourth Test of the 1956 Ashes series, Laker took 9/37 in the first innings and 10/53 in the second to finish with match figures of 19/90. Bob Massie's figures of 16/137, taken in second match of the 1972 Ashes series, is the fourth-best in Test cricket history. \nBest career average.\nA bowler's bowling average is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nNineteenth century English medium pacer George Lohmann holds the record for the best career average in Test cricket with 10.75. J. J. Ferris, one of fifteen cricketers to have played Test cricket for more than one team, is second behind Lohmann with an overall career average of 12.70 runs per wicket.\nBest career economy rate.\nA bowler's economy rate is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of overs they have bowled.\nEnglish bowler William Attewell, who played 10 matches for England between 1884 and 1892, holds the Test record for the best career economy rate with 1.31. Australia's Bert Ironmonger, with a rate of 1.69 runs per over conceded over his 14-match Test career, is fifth on the list.\nBest career strike rate.\nA bowler's strike rate is the total number of balls they have bowled divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nAs with the career average above, the top two bowlers with the best Test career strike rate are George Lohmann and J. J. Ferris, with Lohmann on 34.1 and Ferris with an overall career strike rate of 37.7 balls per wicket.\nMost five-wicket hauls in an innings.\nA five-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking five wickets in a single innings.\nShane Warne is second only to Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan in taking the most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket with Muralitharan taking 67 throughout his career and Warne achieving 37.\nMost ten-wicket hauls in a match.\nA ten-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking ten or more wickets in a match over two innings.\nAs with the five-wicket hauls above, Shane Warne is second only to Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka in taking the most ten-wicket hauls in Test cricket with Muralitharan haven taken 22 to Warne's 10.\nWorst figures in an innings.\nThe worst figures in a single innings in Test cricket came in the third Test between the West Indies at home to Pakistan in 1958. Pakistan's Khan Mohammad returned figures of 0/259 from his 54 overs in the second innings of the match. The worst figures by an Australian is 0/156 that came off the bowling of Mitchell Swepson in his debut Test in March 2022 against Pakistan.\nWorst figures in a match.\nThe worst figures in a match in Test cricket were taken by South Africa's Imran Tahir in the second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in November 2012. He returned figures of 0/180 from his 23 overs in the first innings and 0/80 off 14 in the third innings for a total of 0/260 from 37 overs. He claimed the record in his final over when two runs came from it – enough for him to pass the previous record of 0/259, set 54 years prior.\nThe worst figures by an Australian came in the first Test of the 2010–11 Ashes series when Mitchell Johnson returned figures of 0/66 and 0/104 for a total of 0/170 off 42 overs, equalling the figures that Geoff Lawson set in the second Test of the Ashes series of 1986–87 from 50 overs.\nMost wickets in a series.\nEngland's seventh Test tour of South Africa in 1913–14 saw the record set for the most wickets taken by a bowler in a Test series. English paceman Sydney Barnes played in four of the five matches and achieved a total of 49 wickets to his name. Jim Laker sits second on the list with 46 wickets taken during the 1956 Ashes series. Australia's Clarrie Grimmett is third with his 44 wickets taken against South Africa during the 1935–36 tour.\nWicket-keeping records.\nThe wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the fielding side allowed to wear gloves and leg pads.\nMost career dismissals.\nA wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of a batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nAustralia's Adam Gilchrist is second only to South Africa's Mark Boucher in taking most dismissals in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper, with Boucher taking 555 to Gilchrist 416.\nMost career catches.\nBoucher also leads Gilchrist in the number of catches taken as a designated wicket-keeper in Test cricket, 532 to 379.\nMost career stumpings.\nBert Oldfield, Australia's fifth-most capped wicket-keeper, holds the record for the most stumpings in Test cricket with 52. He is followed by England's Godfrey Evans with 46 to his name. Indian glovemen Syed Kirmani and MS Dhoni are both equal third on 38 and Gilchrist is fifth on the list with 37.\nMost dismissals in an innings.\nFour wicket-keepers have taken seven dismissals in a single innings in a Test match—Wasim Bari of Pakistan in 1979, Englishman Bob Taylor in 1980, New Zealand's Ian Smith in 1991 and most recently West Indian gloveman Ridley Jacobs against Australia in 2000.\nThe feat of taking 6 dismissals in an innings has been achieved by 25 wicket-keepers on 33 occasions including 5 Australians.\nMost dismissals in a series.\nBrad Haddin holds the Test cricket record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a series. He took 29 catches during the 2013 Ashes series which broke the previous record held by fellow Australian Rod Marsh where he took 28 catches in the 1982–83 Ashes series.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. A fair catch is defined as a fielder catching the ball, from a legal delivery, fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nIndia's Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most catches in Test cricket by a non-wicket-keeper with 210, followed by Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka on 205 and South African Jacques Kallis with 200. Ricky Ponting is the highest ranked Australian in fourth, securing 196 catches in his Test career.\nMost catches in a series.\nThe 1920–21 Ashes series, in which Australia whitewashed England 5–0 for the first time, saw the record set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in a Test series. Australian all-rounder Jack Gregory took 15 catches in the series as well as 23 wickets. Greg Chappell, a fellow Australian all-rounder, and India's KL Rahul are equal second behind Gregory with 14 catches taken during the 1974–75 Ashes series and during the 2018 Indian tour of England respectively. Four players have taken 13 catches in a series on six occasions with both Bob Simpson and Brian Lara having done so twice and Rahul Dravid and Alastair Cook once.\nOther records.\nMost career matches.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test matches played with 200, followed by the currently active English fast bowler James Anderson on 172, with former captains Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh being joint third with each having represented Australia on 168 occasions.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nFormer English captain Alastair Cook holds the record for the most consecutive Test matches played with 159. He broke Allan Border's long standing record of 153 matches in June 2018. Mark Waugh, the Australian middle order batsman who played 107 consecutive Test matches, is third. The recently retired New Zealand wicket-keeper-batsman Brendon McCullum, who is fifth on the list with 101 matches, is the highest ranked cricketer who never missed a Test match during his playing career. Adam Gilchrist, in seventh on 96, is the highest ranked Australian player to achieve the feat.\nMost matches as captain.\nGraeme Smith, who led the South African cricket team from 2003 to 2014, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in Test cricket with 109. Allan Border, who skippered Australia from 1984 to 1994 is second with 93 matches. New Zealand's captain from 1997 to 2006, Stephen Fleming, is third on the list with 80 and in fourth on 77 is Australia's Ricky Ponting who led the side for six years from 2004 to 2010.\nYoungest players.\nThe youngest player to play in a Test match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 227 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 24 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest Australian to play Test cricket was Ian Craig who at the age of 17 years and 239 days debuted in the final Test of the series against South Africa in February 1953.\nOldest players on debut.\nAt 49 years and 119 days, James Southerton of England, playing in the very first Test match in March 1877, is the oldest player to make his debut in Test cricket. Second on the list is Miran Bakhsh of Pakistan who at 47 years and 284 days made his debut against India in 1955. Australia's Don Blackie is the third-oldest player to make his debut, breaking into the side during the second Test of the 1928–29 Ashes series at the age of 46 years and 253 days. He broke the record set by his teammate Bert Ironmonger who debuted in the previous Test match two weeks earlier.\nOldest players.\nEngland all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes is the oldest player to appear in a Test match. Playing in the fourth Test against the West Indies in 1930 at Sabina Park, in Kingston, Jamaica, he was aged 52 years and 165 days on the final day's play. The second-oldest Test player is Bert Ironmonger who was aged 50 years and 327 days when he represented Australia for the final time in the fifth Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner, so the innings is closed.\nAustralian batsmen hold two Test wicket partnerships records. Sid Barnes and Don Bradman came together in the second Test of the 1946–47 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground and put together a fifth wicket partnership of 405 runs. The other record is the fourth wicket partnership of 449 which was set by current and former players Shaun Marsh and the Adam Voges. This came in the first Test against the West Indies at Bellerive Oval in December 2015.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest Test partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Sri Lankan pairing of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who put together a third wicket partnership of 624 runs during the first Test against South Africa in July 2006. This broke the record of 576 runs set by their compatriots Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama against India in 1997. New Zealand's Andrew Jones and Martin Crowe hold the third-highest Test partnership with 467 made in 1991 against Sri Lanka. Equal fourth on the list is Mudassar Nazar and Javed Miandad of Pakistan who together scored 451 against Pakistan in 1983 and the Australian pairing of Bill Ponsford and Don Bradman putting on the same score against England in the 1934 Ashes series.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most Test matches umpired with 143, . The currently active Dar set the record in December 2019 overtaking West Indian Steve Bucknor's mark of 128 matches. They are followed by South Africa's Rudi Koertzen who officiated in 108. The most experienced Australian is Daryl Harper who is fourth on the list with 95 Test matches umpired."

        "title": "2009 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 2009 State of Origin series was the 28th time that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was played entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. Queensland won their first two matches to retain the shield and to record 14 series wins, as well as the first time in Origin history that a state had won the series for four consecutive years. Maroon centre Greg Inglis was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as player of the series.\nGame I.\nFor the first time game one of the series was played in Melbourne. The stakes were high for New South Wales in the face of the genuine possibility of a four consecutive series defeat – never yet suffered since the introduction of the three match series format. Blues selectors opted for eight debutantes, dropping fourteen of the seventeen players who appeared in game I of 2008. The new faces were McManus, Jennings, Stewart, Campese, Farah, Creagh, Weyman and Poore.\nWith abundant talent and experience to choose from, Queensland selectors opted for the international backline who had represented Australia in April against New Zealand, meaning Slater at fullback dislodged incumbent Maroon fullback Hunt to the interchange bench. The entire Queensland squad had previous Origin experience with thirteen of them having represented on six or more occasions.\nNew South Wales took a 2–0 lead after an early penalty goal but then in the eighth minute a try to their winger Hayne was disallowed after a long video-referee deliberation. Hayne's right boot was ruled to have brushed the touch line on his way to score, overruling the on field decision of the touch judge. This decision appeared to rock the confidence of the young Blues squad and soon after Queensland took a commanding lead with a succession of tries to Slater, Inglis and then Thurston. Creagh crossed for the Blues before half-time picking up a pass from Hayne after he had chased a kick. The scoreline was 18–6 at the break.\nAs the second half kicked off, Inglis struck quickly with a spectacular try from long range to take the score to 24–6 and his tally to two. New South Wales from that point found some structure and the game played more like the traditional origin arm wrestle till Craig Wing made his entrance from the Blues interchange bench at the 53 minute mark. Two minutes later, off a deflected kick, Wing scored to bring New South Wales within twelve and the Blues dummy halves – Wing and Farah double tagging in the role – began to find gaps in amongst the tiring Queensland forwards. In the 69th minute, another lucky kick deflection, this time off Maroons prop Steve Price and into the hands of Farah which was then passed to Hayne, resulted in Hayne's second try and a 24–18 scoreline with 10 minutes to go. However, in the 78th minute, following a handling error from Blues fullback Kurt Gidley, Darius Boyd crossed in the corner after the scrum, to seal Queensland a 28–18 victory and first blood in the series.\nThe game was watched by a national audience of 3.48 million people which was a record.\nGame II.\nAlthough the media speculated immediately after game I that New South Wales selectors would stick firm with the initial squad, by the time the game II team was announced on 15 June a number of injuries paved the way for numerous changes including the selection of shadow players to cover some players in doubt: Trent Barrett was recalled in his first season back in the NRL since 2007 replacing Terry Campese (dropped); Paul Gallen was selected at lock, replacing Anthony Laffranchi (dropped); Glenn Stewart and Anthony Watmough were moved onto the interchange bench replacing the injured Lewis and Luke Bailey; David Williams was picked on the wing to replace the injured James McManus. Blues selectors also named three shadow players – Tom Learoyd-Lahrs, Joel Monaghan and Josh Morris to cover injuries doubts over Michael Jennings, Jamie Lyon and Craig Wing. Ultimately, Monaghan and Morris came into the side for Jennings and Wing respectively who failed to overcome injury.\nDespite seven players being struck by a virus 24 hours before kick-off, for Queensland the only change was Willie Tonga who was selected to replace the injured Justin Hodges and to make his first Origin appearance since 2004. Neville Costigan was put on stand-by as 18th man instead of Matthew Scott. This was also the first time ever that every club in the NRL provided a player for State of Origin.\nQueensland were set to make history by achieving four series wins in a row. They looked on their way when they went out to an 18–0 lead after 25 minutes with tries to Greg Inglis, Israel Folau and Darren Lockyer. A 22nd minute high shot from Trent Barrett on Inglis, fractured his jaw and saw the Queenslander sidelined for the remainder of the match. Petero Civoniceva also suffered a season-ending foot injury in the first half. Two miraculous tries to Jarryd Hayne had NSW on the comeback trail at halftime. New South Wales then scored again with just under 20 minutes to go to make it an 18–14 scoreline with debutant David Williams scoring. It looked as though NSW could snatch an upset but Queensland put the game beyond doubt when Cameron Smith scored with a minute remaining making the final score 24–14. The Maroons therefore become the first side to win 4 series in a row, since the State of Origin began in 1980 winning 2006, 2007, 2008 and now 2009.\nGame III.\nInjuries saw Queenslanders Hannant and Civoniceva replaced by Scott and Shillington. Neville Costigan moved from 18th man in game II to an interchange spot replacing Nate Myles.\nNew South Wales selectors made a number of changes. Kimmorley was brought in to replace Wallace, making the Blues' halves combination the oldest in Origin history. Morris was brought in for Lyon and Ennis brought in for Farah.\nPerry, Waterhouse and White, all experienced Origin campaigners, made a return to the side at the expense of Weyman and O'Donnell. Jennings and Poore returned from injury, replacing Monaghan and Kite.\nThe Blues also took a leaf out of Queensland's book by having past New South Wales Origin players join the pre-match camp to help the team prepare.\nGame III saw New South Wales looking down the barrel of not just a fourth straight series win to Queensland, but a clean sweep series. Sam Thaiday and Ashley Harrison were approved to play for Queensland in spite of carrying injuries into the game. The heroes for NSW were Kurt Gidley, playing injured and who hadn't been potent in attack in the first two games, Brett Kimmorley making his first Origin return since game II of 2007 and Anthony Watmough who was tireless in attack and defence.\nQueensland took the lead in the 13th minute with a try to Dallas Johnson before Ben Creagh powered over the line six minutes later for the Blues off a short-pass from Watmough. In the 34th minute New South Wales winger David Williams was awarded a try after juggling the ball picked up from a Trent Barrett kick. Thurston lashed out with his boot in desperate defence and kicked Williams in the mouth as he attempted to score. The Blues were thus awarded the first eight-point try in Origin history.\nKimmorley ran down Greg Inglis with a tackle that took the giant centre across the touchline and stopped a certain Queensland try and moments later Kurt Gidley did likewise to a runaway Darius Boyd.\nThe tension was high right to the end. In the 78th minute Jarryd Hayne crossed but the try was disallowed since in the previous play Steve Price had been illegally concussed. After being knocked out by a Brett White punch, Price was \"blindsided\" on his way down by Trent Waterhouse and then medi-cabbed off several minutes later in a state of severe concussion. Queensland players became particularly incensed by the actions of Justin Poore who appeared to pick up and then let fall to the ground the concussed Price. This act was labelled by some Queensland players as 'a dog act'. Waterhouse became the first Blues player in Origin history to be sent off, and the third played player to be sent off in State of Origin after Gordon Tallis in Game I of 2000 while Justin Hodges challenged Brett White to a one-on-one fight. White accepted the challenge by way of a nod and can be seen in several alternate angles (as shown on The Footy Show) responding \"Come on!\", shortly after licking the blood from his lips in a provocative manner. Hodges then signalled for White to come to him and fight, in an attempt to goad White into precipitating a new fight and get sent off, however White ultimately did not accept. Queensland were then awarded a penalty and kicked the ball to New South Wales full back Kurt Gidley who was swamped by Johnathan Thurston, Sam Thaiday, Neville Costigan and Karmichael Hunt. Creagh then pushed Hodges who had come in as support and quickly backpedaled behind his teammates, precipitating a new altercation. Both Creagh and Thaiday were sin binned although the officials were criticised for allowing White, Hodges and Price's replacement to remain on the field. When the fight was finished and Gidley played the ball Williams took the game's final hit-up tackled by Johnathan Thurston which then sparked Michael Crocker to try to fight Blues hooker Michael Ennis before Referee Shayne Hayne broke up their melee and ended the match.\nTeams.\nThe 18th man is a reserve to cover for any forthcoming injuries and, unless chosen, does not actually play.\nNew South Wales Blues.\n1 – Glenn Stewart was originally selected for game one, but subsequently forced to withdraw following suspension for a dangerous tackle. He was replaced by Luke Lewis.\n2 – Paul Gallen was originally selected to play for game one, but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Anthony Laffranchi.\n3 – Michael Jennings was originally selected to play for game two, but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Joel Monaghan.\n4 – Craig Wing was originally selected to play for game 2, but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Josh Morris.\n5 – Jamie Lyon was originally selected to play for game 3, but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Josh Morris."

Each candidate and its National Ski Association will have instructions and a detailed questionnaire provided by the FIS that will be due on 1 September 2009. Candidates respond in a simple text format that will serve as the working document where an FIS Inspection Group will use for discussion purposes. Group members will meet with the candidate at mutually convenient opportunity to review the project area that falls under their responsibility. This should take place in conjunction with another event or World Cup inspection where possible to reduce costs and multiple trips. FIS Technical Committee members will have a working meeting in the fall of 2009 with each candidate and inspection group to review the project. A final report will be submitted in spring 2009 by the Inspection Group and the National Ski Association and FIS Council.\nFinalists.\nThe four finalists who submitted were those who lost out on the previous championships in 2008.\nVoting results.\nThe winner was selected at the FIS Congress in Antalya, Turkey, on 3 June 2010.\nSchedule.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\""

        "text": "Engineer Captain Charles Gerald Taylor (8 May 1863 – 24 January 1915) was a Royal Navy officer and Wales international rugby union player who played club rugby for Blackheath. He was the first Welsh international to be killed in action during World War I. Taylor was an all-round athlete, and at one time was the Welsh pole vault champion.\nMilitary career.\nBorn in Ruabon, Wales, on 8 May 1863, Taylor joined the Royal Navy on 1 July 1885, when he was rated an acting assistant engineer. Following his initial training he was confirmed in the rank on 1 July 1886. He was promoted to engineer on 1 September 1890, and chief engineer on 30 December 1900. He became an engineer lieutenant on 26 March 1903, and on 30 December 1904 was promoted to engineer commander. On 3 February 1911 King George V appointed him a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order On 7 February 1912 he was promoted to engineer captain.\nMuch of Taylor's career was spent at training or other shore establishments. However, shortly after the outbreak of World War I he was posted to the battlecruiser HMS \"Queen Mary\", on 16 September 1914. On 20 November he was transferred to HMS \"Tiger\". On 24 January 1915, \"Tiger\" was one of the vessels engaged in the Battle of Dogger Bank. HMS \"Tiger\" was struck by fire from the German cruiser SMS \"Blücher\", and Taylor died during the engagement. Taylor was not buried at sea, and his body was returned to Britain to be buried at Tavistock New Cemetery in Devon.\nRugby career.\nIt is unlikely Taylor ever played rugby for Ruabon as widely reported. He was an association footballer before he left home at sixteen to enrol as a naval engineering student at HMS Marlborough in Portsmouth. It was there he was converted into a rugby player. Taylor was a member of the HMS Marlborough rugby club when he made his debut for Wales against England in 1884 under the captaincy of Charlie Newman in the Home Nations Championship. \nWales lost the game but Taylor would play in the remaining two games of the campaign against Scotland and Ireland. In 1884 Taylor was reselected for Wales, in a team that would host several past and future captains, including Arthur Gould, Tom Clapp, Frank Hancock and Newman. In the 1885 Championship Taylor made his first international score when he converted William Stadden's try, though as no points were given to conversions at the time he is recorded with no career score.\nIn 1885, Taylor was spending much of his time in London, and when a group of Welshmen came together to form a club for London 'exiles', Taylor was among them. The club formed in June 1885, and Taylor became a committee member at the first meeting and then on 21 October became a member of the very first London Welsh team. \nLondon Welsh would become a prominent club providing many Welsh internationals, the very first team containing six internationals; Taylor, Arthur Gould, Martyn Jordan, Thomas Judson, T. Williams and Rowley Thomas.\nIn 1886, Taylor was part of Frank Hancock's team that experimented with the four threequarter system for the first time in an international match. It was an unsuccessful experiment and was abandoned during the match. Taylor's final game for Wales was in 1887 against Ireland in a win at Birkenhead.\nInternational games played.\nWales"

Williams was offered the position, two other players having failed to succeed for the team at that point, after winning a year's worth of free rent in a place-kicking contest at one of the Red Raiders games.\nEarly years.\nWilliams attended Weatherford High School in Weatherford, Texas, where he played soccer and football. In football, he played both wide receiver and kicker. His signature moment as a kicker occurred when he kicked a 49-yard field goal through the uprights to defeat rival Mineral Wells High School in overtime. He graduated from Weatherford in 2006.\nCollege career.\nTarleton State.\nWilliams walked on to the Tarleton State Texans football team, though was only on the team for a month and never played a game.\nTexas Tech.\nAfter two years at Tarleton State, Williams transferred to Texas Tech. During halftime of Tech's September 20, 2008, football game against the University of Massachusetts, Williams entered a promotional contest in which he made a 30-yard field goal. He caught the attention of head coach Mike Leach, who liked the fundamentals he used on the kick. Leach wanted him on the team, and although it was initially thought he would not be immediately eligible, the NCAA granted a one-time exception based on the specific circumstances. He was allowed to play immediately as he had not been recruited by Tarleton State and also because he was never a scholarship player. However, the season he played on Tarleton State's squad counted toward his eligibility, making him a sophomore during his first year at Tech. He also had to reject the free rent he won in the contest in order to remain eligible.\nWilliams made his debut in a 63–21 win over Kansas where he was a perfect 9 for 9 on PATs. Following the game, Williams was recognized as the AT&amp;T ESPN All-America Player of the Week.\nThe following week, in Texas Tech's 39–33 victory over Texas, Williams was also asked to kick field goals, making two and having one blocked.\nIn 2009, Williams made a career long 43-yard Field Goal against Baylor University in a 20-13 victory. \nWilliams finished his career 149-150 on extra points and 22-28 (78.6%) on field goals. He is currently tied for sixth on the Red Raiders kickers scoring list with 215 career points. He graduated in 2010.\nPost-football career.\nWilliams works as a teacher and football coach at a Mineral Wells High School - the one he notably defeated while he was in school."

The race was won by Gino Bartali of the Legnano team, with fellow Italians Giovanni Valetti and Enrico Mollo coming in second and third respectively.\nParticipants.\nOf the 98 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 8 May, 41 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 30 May. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team or group; 65riders competed as part of a team, while the remaining 33 competed independently. The four teams that partook in the race were: Bianchi, Fréjus, Ganna, and Legnano. Each team was composed of seven riders. There were also seven groups, made up of five riders each, that participated in the race. Those groups were: Italiani All'Estero, Bertoldo, Il Littoriale, S S.

This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nThe liberi classification, one similar to the general classification was calculated, using only independent riders and riders that came as members of groups.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification. The group classification was decided in the same manner, but the classification was exclusive to the competing groups.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

He was originally selected by the Atlanta Thrashers in the fourth round, 116th overall, of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft.\nHe is currently an assistant coach for the Minnesota Wild of the National Hockey League.\nPlaying career.\nAfter 9 seasons within the Carolina Hurricanes organization, Dwyer left the club having played in 416 regular season games as a free agent. Dwyer was unable to attain an NHL contract over the summer and on September 19, 2015, accepted a try-out offer to attend the Arizona Coyotes training camp. At the conclusion of training camp, Dwyer was released from his try-out contract with the Coyotes. With the 2015–16 season underway, Dwyer belatedly signed a contract abroad in Sweden for the remainder of the campaign with Modo Hockey of the SHL on October 22, 2015. Adding depth in a checking line role, Dwyer was unable to contribute offensively, producing just 7 assists in 33 games as Modo were relegated to the HockeyAllsvenskan.\nAs a free agent over the summer, Dwyer returned to North America and agreed to an invitation to attend the Columbus Blue Jackets training camp on a professional try-out on September 21, 2016. Upon his release from the Blue Jackets, Dwyer returned to the Hurricanes fold in preparation for the 2016–17 season, signing a one-year AHL contract with affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers on October 11, 2016.\nAfter a spell in Denmark, Dwyer moved to the UK to sign for the Belfast Giants on 26 July 2018. In his last professional season in 2018–19, Dwyer added a veteran and dominating scoring presence to the Giants, posting 25 goals and 61 points in 38 games.

        "title": "Dixie League (American football)",
        "text": "The \"Dixie League\" was a professional american football minor league founded in 1936 originally as the \"South Atlantic Football Association\", with six charter member teams in the Middle Atlantic states of Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Like the American Association (nicknamed the 'A.A.', which was another minor league in pro football that formed in 1936, (not to be confused with another \"American Association\", an early famous major league baseball group from 1881 to 1892), its popularity (and attendance) rivaled that of another earlier established \"major league\" grouping, the National Football League of 1922 (originally the \"American Professional Football Conference\" formed in 1920, later quickly renamed \"American Professional Football Association\"). Unlike most professional football minor leagues, the \"Dixie League\" had a relative stability in membership during the \"Great Depression\" in the years prior to World War II, maintaining a five or six-team lineup membership of franchises (and adding a team in North Carolina upon the demise of their Washington team franchise in 1941).\nLike the competitor 'AA' and the third \"American Football League\", the \"Dixie League\" suspended operations after the Pearl Harbor attack by Japan, on the \"Day of Infamy\" – Sunday, December 7, 1941; unlike the AFL, the football minor league reorganized after the end of the War and resumed competition in the first post-war season year of 1946. The following year, the 'D.L.' collapsed when one of its member teams purchased the assets of a defunct team in the other pro football minor loop, the \"American Association\" (which then changed its name to the \"American Football League\" in 1946) and opted to jump leagues.\nOrigin.\nThe \"Dixie League\" began its existence in 1936 when six independent teams joined forces for the purposes of competition. Charter members included the Maryland Athletic Club (which moved to Washington, D.C. in 1936 to become the Washington Pros), the Baltimore Orioles (also known sometimes as the Baltimore Blue Jays, but no relation to the later major league \"Orioles\" baseball team in the American League, (1954 to present), Norfolk Clancys, Richmond Arrows, Portsmouth Cubs, and the Alexandria Celtics (the last was a \"traveling team\" with no regular home city). Charles Hamilton became the new \"Dixie League's\" first president.\nAlthough the new League officially called itself at first, the \"South Atlantic Football League\" in its first year of existence, various sportswriters repeatedly unofficially called it the \"Dixie League.\" The name was officially adopted for the second 1937 pro season.\n1936.\nLike the New York Yankees pro football team of the first \"American Football League\", the Richmond Arrows provided the financial backbone of the Dixie League in its first year, averaging twice as many paying spectators per home game as the other league members. The Arrows played all their games at home, offering the visiting teams a five percent bonus for the privilege. On November 15, 1936, Richmond's team coach (Dave Miller) and the players walked off the team in an effort for more pay. Richmond manager Blair Meaney, Jr. hired a new head coach (Bob Burdette) and new players (to join the five who didn't strike) to finish the season.\nBaltimore's Ted Wright led the scoring, while the Orioles/Blue Jays also featured the League's top passer, Leroy \"Sunshine\" Campbell. Until the player strike, back Mush DeLotto provided an explosive running game for the Richmond Arrows.\n\"Playoffs\": Washington defeated Richmond; Baltimore defeated Alexandria&lt;br&gt; \n\"Championship\": Washington beat Baltimore, 3–0, on a Willis Brenner field goal with 13 seconds left in regulation.\nFourth-place finisher Portsmouth declined to participate in the playoffs, opting for a game against nearby rival Norfolk. Despite finishing in last place, Alexandria took Portsmouth's place against Baltimore.\nIn the first game of a series between the 'D.L.' champion and the winners of the American Association, the Washington Pros (Dixie League) defeated the Brooklyn Bay Parkways (American Association) 13–6 in Richmond, Virginia, January 1, 1937. While there would be more exhibition games involving members of the two leagues, this was the last time that an \"American Association\" team lost to a team in the \"Dixie League\" on the gridiron.\n1937.\nCompared to most sporting leagues in their beginning years, the \"Dixie League\" had begun strongly. All six charter members were in strong enough shape to compete in a second season (three of the six remained 'D.L.' members from the 1936 beginning to the aborted 1947 season).\nRichmond was still recovering from the effects of the player rebellion when the strikers formed a new team, the Richmond Rebels, and tried to replace the Arrows in the league. After being rebuffed, the Rebels tried to compete against the Arrows by forming the \"Virginia-Carolina Football League\" and then marched through the season undefeated. The 'V-CFL' lasted only the 1937 season; the Rebels folded along with the league.\nDespite the competition from the Rebels, the Arrows held their own, both on the field and at the turnstiles with their fans. Despite their improved record, the Arrows could finish no higher than third place, behind the undefeated defending champion Washington (which became the Presidents) and the newly rechristened Baltimore Blue Jays or Blue Birds.\nChampionship: no playoffs – Washington clinches title on 3–3 tie with Baltimore\nWhile the league featured balance from top to bottom in its maiden season, it clearly divided into the \"haves\" and \"have nots\" in 1937. Five members of the Washington Presidents (including backfield mates Tom Oliver and Gene Augusterfer) were named to the all league team. Baltimore's Ted Wright was once again the league's leading scorer while teammate \"Sunshine\" Campbell dented defenses with his passes. Richmond placed three linemen on the all league team, including league most valuable player Lyle Graham. The winless Portsmouth team had a future team member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio on its roster, player-coach \"Ace\" Parker, who played in only one game for the Cubs before he signed with the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers team in early November.\n1938.\nAfter two years of stability, the \"Dixie League\" made some adjustments in 1938. William Nickels, Jr. became the league's second president, replacing Charles Hamilton. The DL was forced to play with only five teams after the folding of the Baltimore Blue Jays/Blue Birds, and the Washington Patriots minor league squad became a traveling team (having been upstaged by the NFL's former Boston Braves, later renamed the Boston Redskins later becoming the Washington Redskins and the League's entry into the District of Columbia, the Nation's Capital, the year before) under owner George Preston Marshall.\nA. E. Stutz, the founder and owner of the Norfolk Clancys, died in late 1937; in 1938, new owner Harry Howren started stockpiling talent (including back Mush DeLotto, formerly of Richmond) sufficient enough for the newly renamed the \"Shamrocks\" to dominate League play that year. Another Shamrock player, tackle Vernon \"Buck\" Miles, was named the league's most valuable player at the end of the season.\nThe Portsmouth Cubs, winless in 1937, reached .500 in 1938 as quarterback Larry Weldon led the League in scoring.\n\"No playoffs\": Norfolk was declared league champions\nAfter the season, Norfolk was defeated 16–14 by the Hazelton Redskins, of Pennsylvania, champions of the Eastern Pennsylvania Football League in a game for the \"National Minor League title\". Two members of the 1937 Baltimore Blue Jays/Blue Birds (\"Sunshine\" Campbell and John Spirida) provided the difference in the game, with Campbell throwing two touchdown passes and Spirida scoring ten points in the game.\n1939.\nThe number of traveling teams in the \"Dixie League\" was halved with the folding of the Alexandria Celtics team in Virginia. The number of league members stayed at five with the entrance of the Newport News Builders, which actually played its home games in neighboring Hampton southeast of Newport News on the Virginia Peninsula.\n“Buck” Miles became the league \"M.V.P.\" as he repeated his feat of scoring the most points in the \"Dixie League\". His Cubs finished the season in a tie for the league lead with the Richmond Arrows (the Cubs had a 6–1 record, the Arrows 6–1–1). For the last game, the Cubs added Ace Parker (after he finished an All-Pro season with the NFL's team, the Brooklyn Dodgers). He scored the only touchdown in a 7–0 Cubs victory over Newport News Builders to force a playoff with the Richmond Arrows for the league championship (in which Parker scores the only touchdown in a Cubs 7–0 win).\nPlayoff: Portsmouth 7, Richmond 0 – Portsmouth wins league championship\n1940.\nWith the addition of the Roanoke Travelers, the \"Dixie League\" returned to having six teams for the 1940 season. While the team made a successful debut, finishing in second place, the Travelers had the misfortune of having almost half of its season canceled as a result of bad weather.\nTwo early losses deprived Richmond of a chance for competing for the league title (which was easily won by Portsmouth), but the Arrows entertained the fans by being the first 'D.L.' team to average more than two touchdowns a game. \"Sunshine\" Campbell, returning to the Dixie League after playing in the American Association and the E.P.F.L., provided the passes, and A. B. Conner became the \"M.V.P.\" of the \"Dixie League\" by scoring 49 points.\nPortsmouth's Larry Weldon set a new league record by throwing seven touchdown passes in the span of ten games. Over a span of 20 games in 1939 and 1940, Weldon and the Cubs won 16 games, lose two, and tie two games (a .889 winning percentage) – and win two league titles.\nWashington's Presidents struggled through its third consecutive season as a \"traveling team\", and left the League after the end of the 1940 season.\nNo playoffs: Portsmouth declared league champions for the second straight year.\n1941.\nFor the first time, the \"Dixie League\" had six teams with actual home fields, with the Charlotte Clippers of Charlotte in North Carolina replacing Washington. As the United States started preparing for a war with the \"Axis Powers\", (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan) that appeared to be inevitable in the fall of 1941, the League benefited from the addition of military personnel from bases in the region.\nPlaying for the Newport News Builders, two such newcomers broke passing and scoring records that were established just the previous year. George Cafego had eight of his passes go for touchdowns, while Ken Fryer scored 61 points, more than any minor league player in a single season before the entry of the U.S. into World War II. Despite the records on offense, the Builders finished the 1941 season in third place.\nCharlotte had a successful freshman season in the \"Dixie League\", scoring 184 points, roughly 30 more than Newport News and Norfolk... and the previous record set in 1940 by Richmond. The Clippers finished second to Norfolk, whose star back Pete Sachon was billed as \"Pistol Pete\" three decades before Pete Maravich. \"Pistol Pete\" Sachon was selected the 'D.L.' most valuable player for 1941.\nNo playoffs: Norfolk declared league champion\n1942–1946.\nLike two other professional football leagues – the \"American Association\" and the third \"American Football League\" – the \"Dixie League\" suspended its operations in early 1942 in the wake of the December 7, 1941 Pearl Harbor attack and the U.S. entry into World War II. The League stayed in limbo until 1946. As American troops returned to the homefront in the United States after the end of World War II, the owners of the \"Dixie League\" member teams, led by Howren, announced plans for \"reorganizing\" the League. With the exception of Roanoke (which was replaced by a team from Greensboro), the \"Dixie League\" of 1946 resembled the 'D.L.' of five years earlier, although a couple of members (Richmond and Portsmouth) opted for changes in their team names. William Nickels, Jr. continued as the League president.\nWhile the league opted to maintain continuity on the playing field, the \"Dixie League\" joined forces with the \"American Association\" (which now had changed its name in 1946 to the (third) third \"American Football League\") along with the far western Pacific Coast Professional Football League. On March 24, 1946, P.C.P.F.L. president J. Rufus Klawans announced the \"Big Three\" of the U.S.A.'s pro football's minor leagues had formed the coordinating \"Association of Professional Football Leagues\". The new A.P.F.L. entered into a working compact with the NFL, prohibiting the participation of players signed to \"outlaw leagues\" (originally directed toward the third AFL – which never returned from \"its\" limbo – but was subsequently applied to the now newly formed pro football \"major league\" competitor to the old National Football League, known as the \"All-America Football Conference\" of 1946–1949 which competed with the older pro football loop). The new coordinating Association however, lasted less than two years.\nVirginia Football League (1942).\nNorfolk Shamrocks owner Harry Howren disagreed with the decision of the League (and getting inspiration from 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was quoted as saying that it would be good if the national baseball and football leagues were able to continue to play some games of their seasons, giving inspiration and entertainment to weary war-workers) and opted to form the \"Virginia Football League\" for the 1942 season with 'D.L.' member teams Portsmouth, Newport News, and Richmond. The plans were short-lived as Newport News failed to field a team and the other three teams played only a few games before competition was canceled due to lack of spectator interest (or else the extremely high work-load in the numerous local defense plants and shipyards just getting started up to speed in the War's first year). \nGames.\nRichmond Rockets 32 vs. Portsmouth Cubs 18 (October 11, 1942 in Richmond, VA)&lt;br&gt;\nNorfolk Shamrocks 17 vs. Richmond Rockets 0 (October 18, 1942 in Greensboro, NC)&lt;br&gt;\nRichmond Rockets 33 vs. Portsmouth Cubs 6 (October 27, 1942 in Norfolk, VA)&lt;br&gt;\nRichmond Rockets 19 vs. Norfolk Shamrock 26 (November 1, 1942 in Richmond, VA)\nThe Rockets played an exhibition game in City Stadium against the \"Norfolk Soldiers\" (won 54–6), while the Shamrocks finished the season in a benefit exhibition game against Camp Lee soldiers (won 24–7) that drew 12,500 spectators.\n1946.\nThe new \"working relationship\" that the \"Big Three\" minor leagues and the older \"major league\" NFL reaped positive benefits for the \"Dixie League\" as the 'D.L.' teams lined up various \"sponsors\" with team franchises in the major pro football league. While both \"Dixie League\" and AFL teams acted as \"farm system teams\" for their big league \"sponsors,\" rules were in place to prevent the stockpiling of talent for later use by the old NFL. As a result, the major pro league teams were not permitted to \"raid\" their minor league brethren, and the quality of play, and the players, was a step-up compared to before World War II.\nIn addition to the new Greensboro franchise, the \"Dixie League\" of 1946 had two charter members change their names. The former Portsmouth Cubs became the Portsmouth Pirates, while the former Richmond Arrows adopted a familiar old name: the Richmond Rebels.\nThe 1946 \"Dixie League\" campaign featured a tight race between two teams with potent offenses, the Charlotte Clippers (with backs Casey Jones and Butch Butler) and Richmond (with backs Glenn Knox and Tony Gallovich). League records for offense fell as Butler threw 11 touchdown passes and Richmond's Morgan Tiller had eight touchdown receptions. The two teams were even in their battle for the league title until the Rebels lost their final two games.\nThe \"Dixie League\" had a successful revival in 1946. No one could have foreseen its sudden demise a mere one year later.\nNo playoffs: Charlotte declared Dixie League champions\n1947 and the demise of the \"Dixie League\".\nAfter a successful post-war revival in 1946, the \"Dixie League\" prepared for a season of change in 1947. It inaugurated a new president, Tom Hanes. The Greensboro Patriots moved to Winston-Salem, while the Roanoke Travelers returned to the fold, replacing the defunct Newport News franchise. Plans for possible expansion were being made for the 1948 season.\nThe optimism of the League for its new season started to disappear just before the first week of competition. Both Winston-Salem and Roanoke withdrew, suddenly leaving the \"Dixie League\" with a mere four teams. The week after the \"Opening Day\", (October 5, 1947) games, the League suddenly announced that it was suspending operations for the 1947 season.\nOn October 7, 1947, control of the Portsmouth Pirates was transferred from an ailing Charles Aberson to a group based in Charlottesville, with the agreement that the team would revert to Aberson in 1948. The next day, the League was blindsided by the announcement that longtime 'D.L.' member team, Richmond had purchased the assets of a defunct \"American Football League\" (former \"American Association\") franchise, (the Long Island Indians, which lost all three games they played that season) and defected to the other minor league.\nThe move inflicted a fatal wound to the \"Dixie League\". A month earlier, the Dixie's had six members ready for competition; after the Richmond defection, only three teams remained. The League was forced to call it quits a day after. Dixie League president Tom Hanes protested to NFL president Bert Bell, but since it didn’t involve any member team of the National Football League, he – and the Association of American Professional Football Leagues – could do nothing about it since the agreement didn't include terms of territorial rights between minor leagues and their teams. \nWhile there were discussions of a possible reorganization for a season in 1948, the \"Dixie League\" was no longer a viable entity. The Charlotte Clippers continued through 1949 as an independent team, while members of the Portsmouth Pirates and Norfolk Shamrocks combined forces to also test the waters of independence competition in 1948.\nThe Richmond Rebels, \"Dixie League\" charter members like Portsmouth and Norfolk, continued their participation in the American Football League of 1946 until that league had \"its\" later implosion in 1950 (the Rebels won the last two AFL championships, in 1949 and 1950). The team petitioned to join the competing major league, the new \"All-America Football Conference\" for their fourth 1950 season, but the A.A.F.C. – major league's pending merger negotiations and later agreement with the old National Football League of 1920/1922 thwarted the club's intentions.\nVirginia Negro Football League.\nIn 1946 four Virginia teams formed an all-black league, making it in essence a scaled-down black version of the segregated Dixie League. The league lasted only one season, and most remembered by the fact that they played also against local historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs): Virginia Union, Virginia State and Norfolk State.\nFred Cooper from the Richmond Rams would later become the first black player of the Richmond Rebels in 1949, after they moved to the AFL. \nNo playoffs: Richmond declared League champions after beating out Norfolk. The teams would later play a \"Post-season exhibition game\" in Greensboro, NC to a 0–0 tie."

        "text": "Jason Wyatt Hart (born September 5, 1977) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and first baseman and current assistant hitting coach of the Miami Marlins. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers in .\nHigh school and college.\nStanding at 6'4\" and weighing 240 pounds, Hart attended Fair Grove High School and was originally drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 20th round of the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft. He opted to play college baseball at Southwest Missouri State University. In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was a 2nd-team college All-American and a Missouri Valley Conference All-Star in . He was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the fifth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft, and signed with the club.\nProfessional career.\nHe began his professional career in 1998 with the Southern Oregon Timberjacks, hitting .258 with 20 home runs and 69 RBI with them. He led or tied for the Northwest League lead in games played, home runs and RBI. He earned a trip to the All-Star game and the Northwest League MVP Award that season.\nPlaying for the Modesto A's in , Hart hit .305 with 19 home runs, 48 doubles and 123 RBI in 550 at-bats. Once again, he topped his league (the California League) in multiple categories, those being: at-bats, doubles and RBI.\nIn , Hart had another outstanding season. He spent most of the season with the Double-A Midland RockHounds, hitting .326 with 44 doubles, 30 home runs and 121 RBI for them. He led the Texas League in at-bats, hits, and RBI. Although he spent most of the year with the Rockhounds, he also played five games for the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats, hitting .278 with one home run, one double and four RBI in 18 at-bats. Overall, he hit .324 with 45 doubles, 31 home runs and 125 RBI. He was a Baseball America All-Star, a Double-A All-Star and a Texas League All-Star. Indeed, he was developing into a minor league star.\nAccording to \"Baseball America\", Hart was ranked the 59th best prospect in baseball and the second best prospect in the Athletics organization in . Despite that, he slumped that year while playing for the River Cats. In 494 at-bats, he hit .247 with 19 home runs and 75 RBI.\nOn January 14, , Hart was traded with Gerald Laird, Ryan Ludwick, and Mario Ramos to the Rangers for Carlos Peña and Mike Venafro. Although he slumped mightily in 2001, Baseball America still named him the 10th best prospect in the Rangers organization in 2002.\nIndeed, he did show some improvement in 2002, hitting .263 with 25 home runs and 83 RBI for the Triple-A Oklahoma City RedHawks. He earned a call-up to the big leagues that season, and on August 18 he made his debut, at the age of 24. Facing the Toronto Blue Jays, he appeared as a pinch hitter for Mike Lamb in his first plate appearance and drew a walk. Overall, Hart would appear in 10 games, hitting .267 with three of his four hits being doubles.

        "title": "900 series (bowling)",
        "text": "A 900 series refers to three consecutive perfect games bowled by an individual bowler. A 300 is a perfect score in one game, thus a player's maximum possible score would be 900 in a series of three consecutive games (the typical number of games in a single league session). To achieve the feat, a bowler would have to bowl 36 consecutive strikes.\nSanctioning.\nTo date in the United States, 39 individuals have bowled a total of 40 certified (or \"sanctioned\") 900 series – that is, 900s that have been officially recognized by the United States Bowling Congress (USBC), the sport's national governing body in the US.\nOn 1 July 1982, Glenn Allison bowled the first 900 series to be recorded in sanctioned league play. He achieved this feat using a plastic bowling ball with a conventional drilled grip, on wood lanes, and an oil pattern that would be sanctioned today as sport compliant. This accomplishment was not officially certified by the then-American Bowling Congress (ABC), which cited non-compliant lane conditions. To this day, there is a cult following supporting Glenn Allison and urging the USBC to officially recognize him as the first bowler to achieve a perfect series, especially because it was accomplished before the era of reactive bowling balls, and other scores in the bowling center that night were not unusually high. However, the USBC still refuses to sanction Allison's 900 series after concluding a re-evaluation in 2014, stating among other things that it would call into question all other rejected honor score applications from that era.\nIn fact, the first six 900 series reported in ABC league play were all rejected for certification. The first perfect series to be officially sanctioned by the ABC/USBC was shot by collegiate bowler Jeremy Sonnenfeld in 1997 at Sun Valley Lanes bowling alley in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nThe first 900 in the history of the Professional Bowlers Association was bowled by Joe Scarborough on 22 April 2013 in a PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour) event. The PBA had seen three consecutive 300 games on one other occasion, by Norm Duke in 1996, but this was not considered to be an official 900 series because the games were not part of a contiguous set. The first two of Duke's 300 games were at the end of one round of play, and the third was at the beginning of the next round.\nRobert Mushtare is the youngest bowler to have rolled a USBC-certified 900 series, doing so on 5 December 2005 at age 17 and is also currently the only bowler to have rolled a second certified 900, a feat achieved on 19 February 2006. On 11 January 2017, John Buchanan III became the oldest bowler (71) in USBC history to roll a sanctioned 900 series.\nOn 12 August 2023, Massachusetts-based amateur bowler Dennis Bissonnette rolled three consecutive sanctioned 300 games, not part of a contiguous set. He accomplished the feat across two separate competitions, located at separate bowling centers; one in Wilmington, Delaware, the other in the neighboring town of New Castle. The feat was not recognizable by the USBC, but serves as only the second known example of this unique occurrence."

        "title": "Mounted archery",
        "text": "Mounted archery is a form of archery that involves shooting arrows while on horseback. A horse archer is a person who does mounted archery. Archery has occasionally been used from the backs of other riding animals. In large open areas, mounted archery was a highly successful technique for hunting, for protecting herds, and for war. It was a defining characteristic of the Eurasian nomads during antiquity and the medieval period, as well as the Iranian peoples such as the Alans, Sarmatians, Cimmerians, Scythians, Massagetae, Parthians, and Persians in Antiquity, and by the Hungarians, Mongols, Chinese, and Turkic peoples during the Middle Ages. The expansion of these cultures have had a great influence on other geographical regions including Eastern Europe, West Asia, and East Asia. In East Asia, horse archery came to be particularly honored in the samurai tradition of Japan, where horse archery is called Yabusame.\nThe term mounted archer occurs in medieval English sources to describe a soldier who rode to battle but who dismounted to shoot. Horse archer is the term used more specifically to describe a warrior who shoots from the saddle at the gallop. Another term, \"horseback archery\", has crept into modern use.\nHorse archery developed separately among the people of the South American pampas and the North American prairies following the introduction of domesticated horses to the continent; the Comanches were especially skilled.\nBasic features.\nSince using a bow requires the rider to let go of the reins with both hands, horse archers need superb equestrian skills if they are to shoot on the move. The natives of large grassland areas used horse archery for hunting, for protecting their herds, and for war. Horse archery was for many groups a basic survival skill, and additionally made each able-bodied man, at need, a highly mobile warrior. The buffalo hunts of the North American prairies may be the best-recorded examples of bowhunting by horse archers.\nIn battle, light horse archers were typically skirmishers, lightly armed missile troops capable of moving swiftly to avoid close combat or to deliver a rapid blow to the flanks or rear of the foe. Captain Robert G. Carter described the experience of facing Quanah Parker's forces: \"an irregular line of swirling warriors, all rapidly moving in right and left hand circles.. while advancing, to the right or left, and as rapidly concentrating... in the centre... and their falling back in the same manner...all was most puzzling to our... veterans who had never witnessed such tactical maneuvers, or such a flexible line of skirmishers\"\nIn the tactic of the Parthian shot the rider would retreat from the enemy while turning his upper body and shooting backward. Due to the superior speed of mounted archers, troops under attack from horse archers were unable to respond to the threat if they did not have ranged weapons of their own. Constant harassment would result in casualties, morale drop and disruption of the formation. Any attempts to charge the archers would also slow the entire army down.\nAn example of these tactics comes from an attack on Comanche horse archers by a group of Texas Rangers, who were saved by their muzzle-loading firearms and by a convenient terrain feature. Fifty Rangers armed with guns met about 20 Comanche hunters who were hunting buffalo and attacked them. The Comanches fled, easily keeping clear of the Rangers, for several miles across the open prairie. They led the Rangers into a stronger force of two hundred. The Rangers immediately retreated, only to discover they had committed a classic error in fighting mounted archers: the Comanches pursued in turn, able to shoot what seemed like clouds of arrows. The Rangers found a ravine where they could shoot at the Comanche from cover. The horse archers did not charge but kept the Rangers under siege until seven of them were dead or dying, whereupon the Rangers retreated but claimed victory.\nHeavy horse archers.\nHorse archers may be either light, such as Scythian, Hun, Parthian, Cuman, or Pecheneg horsemen, or heavy, such as Byzantine kavallarioi, Turkish timariots, Russian druzhina and Japanese samurai. Heavy horse archers typically fought as formed units. Instead of harassing without ever making contact, they shot in volleys, weakening the enemy before they charged. In addition to bows, they often also carried close combat weapons, such as lances or spears. Some nations, like medieval Mongols, Hungarians and Cumans, fielded both light and heavy horse archers. In some armies, such as those of the Parthians, Palmyrans, and the Teutonic Order of Knights, the mounted troops consisted of both super-heavy troops (cataphracts and knights) without bows, and light horse archers.\nAppearance in history.\nHorse archery first developed during the Iron Age, gradually replacing the Bronze Age chariot.\nThe earliest depictions are found in the artwork of the Neo-Assyrian Empire of about the 9th century BC and reflect the incursions of the early Iranian peoples.\nEarly horse archery, depicted on the Assyrian carvings, involved two riders, one controlling both horses while the second shot. Heavy horse archers first appeared in the Assyrian army in the 7th century BC after abandoning chariot warfare and formed a link between light skirmishing cavalrymen and heavy cataphract cavalry. The heavy horse archers usually had mail or lamellar armor and helmets, and sometimes even their horses were armored.\nMounted archery was prevalent in the cavalry tactics of Meroitic and post-Meroitic Nubia.\nSkirmishing requires vast areas of free space to run, maneuver, and flee, and if the terrain is close, light horse archers can be charged and defeated easily. Light horse archers are also very vulnerable to foot archers and crossbowmen, who are smaller targets and can outshoot horsemen. Large armies very seldom relied solely on skirmishing horse archers, but there are many examples of victories in which horse archers played a leading part. The Roman general Crassus led a large army, with inadequate cavalry and missile troops, to catastrophe against Parthian horse archers and cataphracts at the Battle of Carrhae. The Persian king Darius the Great led a campaign against the mounted Scythians, who refused to engage in pitched battle; Darius conquered and occupied land but lost enough troops and supplies that he was compelled to withdraw. Darius, however, kept the lands he had conquered.\nAccording to the Greek historian Herodotus, the Persian general Mardonius used horse archers to attack and harass his opponents during the Battle of Plataea, which was won by the Greeks. Philip of Macedon scored an epic victory against the Scythians residing north of the Danube, killing their king, Ateas, and causing their kingdom to fall apart thereafter. Alexander the Great defeated Scythians/Sakas in 329 BC at the Battle of Jaxartes, at the Syr Darya river. Later on, Alexander himself used mounted archers recruited among the Scythians and Dahae, during the Greek invasion of India.\nThe Roman Empire and its military also had extensive use of horse archers after their conflict with eastern armies that relied heavily on mounted archery in the 1st century BC. They had regiments such as the Equites Sagittarii, who acted as Rome's horse archers in combat. The Crusaders used conscripted cavalry and horse archers known as the Turcopole, made up of mostly Greek and Turks.\nHeavy horse archers, instead of skirmishing and hit-and-run tactics, formed in disciplined formations and units, sometimes intermixed with lancers as in Byzantine and Turkish armies, and shot as volleys instead of shooting as individuals. The usual tactic was to first shoot five or six volleys at the enemy to weaken him and to disorganize them, and then charge. Heavy horse archers often carried spears or lances for close combat or formed mixed units with lancers. The Mongol armies and others included both heavy and light horse archers.\nHeavy horse archers could usually outshoot their light counterparts, and because of the armor they wore, could better withstand return fire. The Russian druzhina cavalry developed as a countermeasure to the Tatar light troops. Likewise, the Turkish timariot and qapikulu were often as heavily armored as Western knights and could match the Hungarian, Albanian, and Mongol horse archers.\nVietnam's mounted archers were first recorded in the 11th century. In 1017, Emperor Lý Công Uẩn of Đại Việt opened the \"Xa Dinh\" (archery school) in southern Hanoi and ordered all children of noblemen and mandarins to be trained in mounted archery. During the reign of Lý Thánh Tông, the royal guards had 20 horse archer teams, combined into 5 companies named \"Kỵ Xạ\", \"Du Nỗ\", \"Tráng Nỗ\", \"Kính Nỗ\", and \"Thần Tý\", comprising about 2,000 skillful horse archers. They later effectively participated in the Invasion of Song China (1075 – 1076) and caused heavy casualties to the Song army. The Ly Dynasty's horse archers also fought against Champa (1069) and the Khmer Empire (1125–1130) which both were victories for Đại Việt. Later, following the decline of the Lý dynasty, most horse archer teams were disbanded.\nGerman and Scandinavian medieval armies made extensive use of mounted crossbowmen. They would act not only as scouts and skirmishers but also protect the flanks of the knights and infantry, chasing away enemy light cavalry. When the battle was fully engaged, they would charge at the enemy flank, shoot a single devastating volley at point-blank range and then attack the enemy with swords, without reloading. In some instances, mounted crossbowmen could also reload and fire continuously on horseback if they used specific \"weaker\" crossbows that could be reloaded easily, as mentioned in the 13th-century Norwegian educational text Konungs skuggsjá. The invention of spanning mechanisms such as the goat's foot lever and the cranequin allowed mounted crossbowmen to reload and fire heavy crossbows on horseback.\nDecline.\nHorse archery was usually ineffective against massed foot archery. The foot archers or crossbowmen could outshoot horse archers and a man alone is a smaller target than a man and a horse. The Crusaders countered the Turkoman horse archery with their crossbowmen, and Genoese crossbowmen were favoured mercenaries in both Mamluk and Mongol armies. Likewise the Chinese armies consisted of massed crossbowmen to counter the nomad armies. A nomad army that wanted to engage in an archery exchange with foot archers would itself normally dismount. The typical Mongol archer shot from a sitting position when dismounted.\nHorse archers were eventually rendered obsolete by the maturity of firearm technology. In the 16th and subsequent centuries, various cavalry forces armed with firearms gradually started appearing. Because the conventional arquebus and musket were too awkward for a cavalryman to use, lighter weapons such as the carbine had to be developed, which could be effectively used from horseback, much in the same manner as the composite recurve bow presumably developed from earlier bows. 16th-century dragoons and carabiniers were heavier cavalry equipped only with firearms, but pistols coexisted with the composite bow, often used by the same rider, well into the 17th century in Eastern Europe, especially with the Russians, Kalmyks, Turks, and Cossacks. For many armies, mounted archery remained an effective tactical system in open country until the introduction of repeating firearms.\nBy the 18th century, firearms had largely displaced traditional composite bows in Mongolia, whereas in Manchuria horse archery was still highly esteemed. In the 1758 Battle of Khorgos, mounted Mongolian Dzungars troops armed with muskets faced off against Qing Dynasty mounted Manchurian, Mongolian, and Chinese archers armed with Manchu bows. The battle was won by the Qing forces. Traditional Manchurian archery continued to be practiced in China up to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the Russian Imperial Army deployed Cossack, Bashkir, and Kalmyk horse archers against Napoleon's forces. Baron de Marbot writes that on the eve of the Battle of Leipzig, his forces encountered mounted archers: \nAlthough general de Marbot describes the horse archers in disdainful terms, the general was himself wounded in the leg by an enemy arrow, and Baskir troops were amongst the occupying troops in Paris in 1814. \nIt has been proposed that firearms began to replace bows in Europe and Russia not because firearms were superior but because they were easier to use and required less practice. However, discussing buffalo hunting in 1846, Francis Parkman noted that \"the bows and arrows which the Indians use in running buffalo have many advantages over firearms, and even white men occasionally employ them.\" The Comanches of North America found their bows more effective than muzzle loading guns. \"After... about 1800, most Comanches began to discard muskets and pistols and to rely on their older weapons.\" Bows were still used by Native Americans in the late American Indian Wars, but almost all warriors who had immediate access to modern repeating firearms used these guns instead.\nTechnology.\nThe weapon of choice for Eurasian horse archers was most commonly a composite recurve bow, because it was compact enough to shoot conveniently from a horse while retaining sufficient range and penetrating power. North Americans used short wooden bows often backed with sinew, but never developed the full three-layer composite bow.\nModern revival.\nHorse archery and associated skills were revived in Mongolia after independence in 1921 and are displayed at festivals, in particular the Naadam. Despite the formidable history of Mongolian horse archers, the sport is very limited in Mongolia itself today and at most Naadam festivals the archery and horse-riding competitions are conducted independently; the horses are raced with one another, and the archery is traditionally practiced from a standing position rather than mounted. In the past five years a desire to revive the tradition seems to have been addressed with the foundation of the Mongolian Horseback Archery Association whose members have competed in South Korea and Europe.\nChina.\nTraditionally, mathematics, calligraphy, literature, equestrianism, archery, music, and rites were known as the Six Arts.\nAt the Guozijian (Imperial Academy), law, mathematics, calligraphy, equestrianism, and archery were emphasized by the Ming dynasty Hongwu Emperor in addition to Confucian classics, and were also required in the Imperial Examinations. Archery and equestrianism were added to the exam by Hongwu in 1370 like how archery and equestrianism were required for non-military officials at the 武舉 College of War in 1162 by the Song Emperor Xiaozong. The area around the Meridian Gate of Nanjing was used for archery by guards and generals under Hongwu.\nThe Imperial exam included archery. Archery on horseback was practiced by Chinese living near the frontier. Wang Ju's writings on archery were followed during the Ming and Yuan and the Ming developed new methods of archery. Jinling Tuyong showed archery in Nanjing during the Ming. Contests in archery were held in the capital for Garrison of Guard soldiers who were handpicked.\nEquestrianism and archery were favored activities of Zhu Di (the Yongle Emperor).\nArchery and equestrianism were frequent pastimes by the Zhengde Emperor. He practiced archery and horseriding with eunuchs. Tibetan Buddhist monks, Muslim women and musicians were obtained and provided to Zhengde by his guard Ch'ien Ning, who acquainted him with the ambidextrous archer and military officer Chiang Pin. An accomplished military commander and archer was demoted to commoner status on a wrongful charge of treason was the Prince of Lu's grandson in 1514.\nHe was disinterested in military matters but had prowess in archery (Hongxi Emperor).\nArchery competitions, equestrianism and calligraphy were some of the pastimes of the Wanli Emperor.\nFootball and archery were practiced by the Ming Emperors.\nTraditional Korean.\nKorea has a tradition of horse archery. In 2007, the Korean government passed a law to preserve and encourage development of traditional Korean martial arts, including horse archery.\nIn Korean archery competitions there are five disciplines that are competed separately. The major difference in Korean archery is that all arrows must be stowed somewhere on the archer or horse, unlike Hungarian style where the archer can take the arrows from the bow hand. Traditionally this is a quiver on the right thigh, but it may also be through a belt, a sash, a saddle quiver or even held in a boot or arm quiver.\nThe first competition is a single shot to the side. The track is long (as in the Hungarian method) but carries only one target set back around 5–10m from the track. This has a unique fascia that consists of five square concentric rings which increase in point score from the outer to inner; the inner (often decorated with a 'Tiger' face) is worth the maximum five points. Each archer has two passes to complete, and each run has to be completed within 16 seconds (or penalty points are incurred).\nThe next competition is very similar but is known as the \"double shot\" which features one target in the first 30m, slightly angled forwards, and a second target in the last 30m, slightly angled backwards.\nThe final competition for the static targets is the \"serial shot\" which consists of five targets evenly spaced along a track, approximately one target every or so. In all three static target competitions, additional bonus points are awarded for style and form.\nAnother major difference in Korean archery style is the \"Mogu\", or moving target competition. This consists of one rider towing a large cotton-and-bamboo ball behind their horse while another archer attempts to shoot the ball (with special turnip-headed arrows which have been dipped in ink). The archer attempts to hit the ball as many times as possible. A second \"Mo Gu\" event consists of a team of two trying to hit the target towed by a third rider. Points are awarded for how many arrows strike the ball (verified by the ink stains on the Mogu).\nTraditional Japanese.\nThe history of Japanese horse archery dates back to the 4th century. It became popular in Japan, attracting crowds. The emperor found that the crowds were not appropriate to the solemn and sacred nature of the occasion, and banned public displays in 698. Horse archery was a widely used combat technique from the Heian period to the Warring States period. Nasu no Yoichi, a samurai of the Kamakura period is the most famous horse archer in Japan. (Kasagake, Yabusame, and Inuoumono (dog shooting)) were defined.\nWhen the arquebus was introduced by the Portuguese to Japan in the 16th century, archery became outdated. To maintain traditional Japanese horse archery, Tokugawa Yoshimune, the \"shōgun\", ordered the Ogasawara clan to found a school. Current Japanese horse archery succeeds to the technique reformed by the Ogasawara clan.\nTraditionally, women were barred from performing in yabusame, but in 1963 female archers participated in a yabusame demonstration for the first time.\nThe Yabusame school of horseback archery has found a following in Australia, with the setting up of the Australian Horse Archery School which today conducts public shows in various parts of the world.\nUnited States.\nHorse archery is a growing sport in the United States. Through the efforts of organizations such as The Mounted Archery Association of the Americas, there are horse archery clubs around the country. Competitive courses one might find in the U.S. incorporate the Korean, Hungarian and Persian Styles (i.e., the Qabaq). Participants combine archery skills with riding a horse, with care and training of the horse undertaken. Riders run reinless down a 90-meter course while loosing arrows at various target arrangements. MA3 Clubs around the country offer members the opportunity to learn the sport by providing ranges, a ranking system, and competitions.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe British Horseback Archery Association was established in 2007, and is the governing body of horse archery. The first national competition took place in 2010. Since 2013, members have represented Great Britain in international team competitions. Postal matches are also held with participants from across the UK. Categories for disabled riders and for juniors have also been introduced.\nHungary.\nKassai Lajos created a competitive rule system of horse archery in the late 1980s, and started to propagate this new form of the sport, first in Hungary, and from the 1990s in the rest of Europe, the United States, and Canada.\nHis life and work was dramatized by Géza Kaszás in the film \"A lovasíjász\" (\"The horse archer\"), which premiered in January 2016."

        "title": "1987 Major League Baseball draft",
        "text": "The 1987 Major League Baseball draft is the process by which Major League Baseball (MLB) teams select athletes to play for their organization. High school seniors, college juniors and seniors, and anyone who had never played under a professional contract were considered eligible for the draft. The 1987 MLB Draft took place as a conference call to the Commissioner of Baseball's office in New York from June 2–4. As opposed to the National Football League Draft which appeared on ESPN, no network aired the MLB Draft.\nThe American League (AL) and the National League (NL) alternated picks throughout the first round; because an NL team drafted first in the 1986 MLB Draft, an AL team had the first selection in 1987. Having finished 67–95 in 1986, the Seattle Mariners had the worst record in the AL and thus obtained the first overall selection. The second selection went to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had the worst record in the NL.\nWith the first overall pick, the Mariners drafted Ken Griffey Jr. from Moeller High School. Griffey Jr. became a 13-time All-Star and helped Seattle make its first postseason appearance in franchise history. Mark Merchant, the second overall pick, however, never played in a major league game. Two years after he was drafted, the Pirates traded Merchant to Seattle, where he got to meet Ken Griffey Jr. Chicago White Sox' first overall selection Jack McDowell won the 1993 Cy Young Award as Chicago made a League Championship Series appearance that year. The total number of athletes drafted, 1,263, broke a record for the most players ever chosen in a draft. In total, 27 All-Stars were selected in 1987, although not all signed a professional contract. , only three players from the draft has been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame– Craig Biggio, Griffey, Jr, and Mike Mussina, though Mussina did not sign in this draft.\nBackground.\nAs with prior drafts, the team with the worst overall record from the previous season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, the team with the worse record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had the first pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.\nThe date of the draft was set for June 2–4, and would occur as a conference call to the Commissioner of Baseball's office in New York. Unlike the 1987 NFL Draft, which aired on ESPN, no network televised the MLB draft. High school seniors, college juniors and seniors, and anyone who had never played under a professional contract were considered eligible to be drafted. For the first time, junior college players would also be included in the June draft; in years past, teams would select junior college players in a separate draft.\nSelections could be transferred or added if a team signed a certain type of free agent: the Elias Sports Bureau ranked players as either type-A (top 30 percent of all players), type-B (31 percent to 50 percent), or type-C (51 percent to 60 percent), based on the athlete's performance over the past two seasons. If a \"type-A\" player became a free agent, the team that lost the type-A player would receive the first-round draft pick from the team that signed the player, as well as a \"sandwich pick\" between the first and second rounds. If a \"type-B\" became a free agent, the team that lost him would receive a second-round pick from the team that signed the player. If a \"type-C\" became a free agent, the team that lost him would receive a compensation pick between the second and third rounds. The top 13 selections were considered \"protected picks\" and exempt from this rule.\nWith a record of 67–95, the Seattle Mariners ended the 1986 Major League Baseball season with the worst record in the AL and thus obtained the first overall selection. The Mariners never had a winning record in the twelve years since the franchise's creation (their best winning percentage was .469, accomplished in 1982), and during the 1986 season, changed managers three times. In the NL, the Pirates finished with the league's worst record for the second year in a row and were given the second overall pick. The 1986 World Series champion New York Mets drafted third-to-last, with the runner-up Boston Red Sox selecting last.\nOther players to reach MLB.\nThe following players were drafted outside of the first two rounds and played in at least one major league game:\nAftermath.\nThe Kansas City Royals had the most picks of any team, with 74; following the Royals, the Toronto Blue Jays made 71, and the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets made 61 apiece. The total number of players drafted, 1,263, broke a record for the most players ever selected in a draft. The previous record of 1,162 was set during the 1967 draft. The California Angels drafted the fewest future MLB players, with only four of their draftees appearing in an MLB game, while the Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers both drafted 13 future MLB players, the most of any team.\nWith their first overall pick, the Mariners selected Ken Griffey Jr., an outfielder from Moeller High School. Over his 22-year career, Griffey Jr. was elected to thirteen All-Star games, won seven Silver Slugger Awards, and helped Seattle make their first playoff appearance as a franchise during the 1995 season. Mark Merchant, whom the Pirates drafted second overall, never played in an MLB game; two years after they drafted him, Pittsburgh traded Merchant to Seattle. The Pirates made the playoffs for three consecutive seasons from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series all three years.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "Baseball City Royals",
        "text": "The Baseball City Royals were a farm team for the Kansas City Royals from 1988 to 1992, after moving from Fort Myers, Florida, where they were known as the Fort Myers Royals.\nThe Baseball City Royals (based in Davenport, FL) were members of the Florida State League in 1988. Managed by Luis Silverio, they had the FSL's second-best record that year at 79-60 but lost the first-half central division to the Osceola Astros by two games and the second-half race to the Lakeland Tigers by half a game. They were sixth in the 14-team league in attendance (63,746). Outscoring opponents just 557-545, the team had two All-Stars - catcher Carlos Escalera (.253/~.293/.345) and pitcher Aguedo Vasquez (3-2, 33 Sv, 1.67, 54 H in 80 IP). Vasquez led the FSL in saves and games pitched (62) and won the league's MVP award. Going on to fairly long and productive big league careers would be a sizeable contingent of Kevin Appier (10-9, 2.75), 1B-DH Jeff Conine (.272/~.345/.443), 3B Sean Berry (.234/~.309/.319, 24 SB) and 2B Brian McRae (.308/~.378/.355).\nIn 1989, the Royals had a worse overall record by one game (78-61) but won the first half in the central division (42-27). In the playoffs, they fell 2 games to 0 to the St. Petersburg Cardinals. The attendance plummeted to 39,220 (12th). Silverio's club led the FSL in offense (698 runs) while they allowed 615. They had no All-Stars that season. OF Pete Alborano (.337/~.385/.411) and C Jorge Pedre (.327/~.367/.500) provided excellent contact, while Escalera improved to .294/~.344/.417. Also returning were Berry (.266/~.339/.378, 37 SB) and Conine (.273/~.335/.433, 32 SB, a team-high 14 HR and 91 K). Dazzling on the hill were Carlos Maldonado (11-3, 9 Sv, 1.17, 47 H in 77 IP) and Dennis Moeller (9-0, 1.77).\nBrian Poldberg became manager in 1990 and the team fell to 60-78 while they drew a league-low 18,884. Outscored 675-542, the club had few bright spots. A few bright spots were Mark Parnell (2-2, 17 Sv, 1.86, 24 H, 40 K in 39 IP) and Greg Harvey (5-1, 2.04, 27 H in 40 IP) on the mound. OF Jacob Brumfield overcame a release in spring training and won the batting title at .366/.429/.417. He also paced the FSL in OBP and stole 47 bases in 57 attempts. He made the league's All-Star team.\nThe 1991 Baseball City team had a 446-461 run margin and the Carlos Tosca-managed nine went 62-69. At 35-30 in the second half, they were one game behind Lakeland in the Central. Doug Harris (10-6, 2.47) finished ninth in ERA for the All-Star-less team. OF Kerwin Moore (.210/~.319/.322) led the FSL in steals (61) and strikeouts (141) while the top offensive threat was 3B Phil Hiatt (.298/~.344/.451, 28 SB). Brian Ahern (7-2, 2.00) was effective in 13 starts, while the bullpen boasted fine production from Matt Karchner (6-3, 5 Sv, 1.97, 49 H in 73 IP), Tony Long (7-3, 10 Sv, 1.96) and Skip Wiley (4-2, 17 Sv, 1.68). They drew 21,174 fans, next-to-last in the FSL.\nIn 1992, the Royals were 71-60 and finished sixth under the guidance of Ron Johnson. Their attendance of 17,406 was second-lowest, but almost 40,000 less than the next team. Making the playoffs as a wild card, they stunned the favorite Sarasota White Sox 2 games to 0 then beat the Osceola Astros 2 games to 1, before falling to Lakeland 2 games to 0 in the finals. They had a 532-464 edge in runs. FSL managers selected C Lance Jennings (.259/~.317/.420) as the 8th-best prospect in the loop and he was their only All-Star, sharing FSL All-Star honors with Dunedin's Carlos Delgado.\n1B Joe Vitiello (.283/~.357/.388) made the league's top 10 in average, while 3B Joe Randa hit .275/~.318/.328 in 51 contests. Long (3-3, Sv, 1.83) again pitched well, as did Kevin Kobetitsch (3-0, 4 Sv, 1.26, .78 WHIP). Jon Lieber (3-3, 4.65) made seven appearances en route to a fine MLB career.\nIn 1993, Kansas City moved their high class-A affiliate to the Wilmington Blue Rocks. The Baseball City FSL franchise was then shifted to Daytona Beach, where it became the Daytona Cubs. "

The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the World Indoor Cricket Federation (WICF) and is held at varying intervals. The first Masters World Series contest was organised in Australia in 2001. Separate world championships are held for both junior and open age groups with the Junior World Series of Indoor Cricket and the Indoor Cricket World Cup held at similar intervals.\nThe World Series is contested by the members of the WICF (though member nations have not always entered teams) and beyond being an affiliated member of that body there are no formal qualifications for entry. Australia have been the most successful side with 20 collective titles.\nTournament Format.\nWhilst the precise nature of the tournament has varied slightly over the years, each tournament usually follows a simple round robin format followed by finals contested by the highest placed sides. The semi finals are contested by the top four sides and more often than not the winner of each semi final progresses to the World Series final.\nThe tournament usually takes place over the course of 7 to 10 days and is sometimes run in conjunction with the Junior World Series or other international contests. \nOn occasions where insufficient nations enter sides a test series is played in place of a World Series. This occurred in 2005 and 2013 where the only entrants in the Over 30 Women division were Australia and South Africa. Whilst Australia earned the title of World Champions as a result of winning this series the tournament itself was not classified as a World Series and is therefore not included as such."

        "text": "Barry Steven Evans (born November 30, 1955) is an American former Major League Baseball third baseman. He played all or part of five seasons in the major leagues from until . He was born in Atlanta, Georgia.\nPro career.\nBarry Evans was drafted by the New York Mets in the 8th round of the June MLB draft out of West Georgia. Evans did not sign with the Mets. He was drafted again the next season, this time by the San Diego Padres in the second round. Evans, upon being drafted, reported to the Padres minor league affiliate in Walla Walla. In his first season of pro ball, Evans batted .358 and slugged 11 home runs for the single A team. The next season, Evans was promoted to San Diego's Double-A team in Amarillo. There again, Evans showed his power at the plate by hitting ten home runs, and again batted over .300. The Padres rushed Evans to the big leagues, recalling him from Amarillo to the major league club, thus bypassing the Triple-A level.\nOn September 4, 1978, Evans made his major league debut in Atlanta against the Braves. Evans started at third and was part of an infield that included Gene Tenace at first, Mike Champion at second, and future Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith at shortstop. Evans made an impressive debut, getting three hits in six at bats and driving in a run as the Padres easily beat the Braves 8-4, with Gaylord Perry earning his 16th win of the season. While Evans excelled at the plate, he did make an error in his MLB debut.\nOverall in his first season in the majors, Evans played in 24 games, batted .267 and drove in four runs. Evans made the Padres to start the 1979 season. He played 56 games while serving as an understudy to incumbent third baseman Paul Dade. While he did hit his first home run in the majors, he struggled at the plate, hitting only .216. Evans refused a demotion to Double-A and told the team that he would be stepping away from baseball to pursue a professional tennis career, a pursuit which would ultimately be unsuccessful.\nIn 1980, Evans returned to baseball and played the role of utility infielder, with Luis Salazar taking over the role of back-up third baseman. With the exception of Ozzie Smith, the entire infield saw turn over from the previous season, with former starter Dade reduced to a back-up as well. While Evans appeared in 73 games and his batting average improved, his ability to hit the long ball that he showed in the minors had failed to materialize in the majors. In 1981, Evans appeared in fewer games, with Tim Flannery getting more time as the main utility infielder. Even though there were multiple changes again in the Padres infield, Evans failed to capture a starting spot, as Salazar had passed Evans and was now the Padres starting third baseman.\nIn 1982, former Oakland A's manager Dick Williams took over as manager of the Padres. While San Diego enjoyed a .500 season, Evans was no longer there. Evans was acquired by the New York Yankees and split his time between the parent club and their Triple-A team, the Columbus Clippers. Evans played in his last major league game, going hitless against the Boston Red Sox. After playing in the minors in 1984, Evans signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in hopes of making it back to the majors. After spending three seasons with The Phillies Triple A team in Maine, Evans retired from baseball in 1986."

Two months later, he would win the Gibraltar Open. Rodríguez then attempted to qualify for the BDO World Championship in November but failed, and in the same month he failed to make any headway in the World Masters.\nIn 2008 he decided to join the Professional Dart Players Association, enabling him to play in PDC events. Because he is based in Spain, he is unable to travel to every event on the PDC Pro Tour, however a couple of last 16 placings in Players Championship events and UK Open regionals meant he qualified for the UK Open, his first appearance on television. He entered at the last 96 stage, but was beaten 6-1 by Paul Cooper. In October, he tried to qualify for the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts but was defeated in the early rounds. Later that month however, Rodríguez began to finally make significant gains in the PDC. In the second of two Players Championship events in Scotland, he reached his first PDC quarter-final before being defeated by the eventual winner James Wade.\nThe run of form continued in October as Rodríguez reached the final of the German Darts Trophy, beating noted veterans Peter Manley and Kevin Painter 3-0 in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, before being defeated in a last leg decider by Colin Osborne. This performance guaranteed Rodríguez's place in the inaugural European Championship and the 2009 PDC World Championship. Less than a week later Rodríguez, in a major upset, defeated the world number five Terry Jenkins in the opening round of the 2008 European Championship, but lost to Ronnie Baxter in the next round.\nRodríguez began his 2009 PDC World Championship campaign with a 3-2 win over then world number 16 Roland Scholten of the Netherlands to safely carry him through the second round, but he was then beaten 1-4 by Painter. At the 2010 World Championship, he was defeated 0-3 by Steve Beaton in the first round.\nHe teamed up with Antonio Alcinas to represent Spain at the 2010 PDC World Cup of Darts. They defeated Japan in the first round, before knocking out the top seeds England (represented by the world's top two players, Phil Taylor and James Wade) 6–5 in the second round. In the group stage, they lost to Wales but defeated the United States and Scotland to qualify for the semi-finals, where they were whitewashed 0–4 by the Netherlands.\nHe partnered Alcinas again in the 2012 World Cup, but they could not repeat their success of 2010 as they were beaten 2–5 by South Africa in the first round. In the rest of 2012 his best results in ProTour events were runs to the last 64, which he did three times.\nRodriguez qualified for the 2013 World Championship by winning the West European Qualifying Event with a 6–5 victory over Stefan Couwenberg in the final. He lost to John Bowles by four legs to two in the preliminary round, as he hit just 14% of his darts at a double. After the tournament Rodriquez was ranked world number 111, meaning he had lost his place on the tour and therefore entered Q School in order to regain a tour card for PDC events in 2013. However, he could not advance past the last 64 on any of the four days and will not have automatic entry into any PDC event in 2013.\nRodríguez played with Antonio Alcinas for the third time in the World Cup of Darts and they qualified from Group D courtesy of a 5–3 win over Italy. They then repeated their 2010 shock win over the Scottish pair of Gary Anderson and Robert Thornton this time 5–4 and faced Richie Burnett and Mark Webster in the quarter-finals. Alcinas lost to Webster 3–4, but Rodríguez beat Burnett by the same scoreline to mean a doubles match was needed to settle the tie. Spain took an early 2–1 lead but went on to be defeated 2–4. In the second round of the 2014 edition of the event, Rodríguez and Alcinas lost their singles matches against the Dutch pair of Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld to exit the tournament.\nRodríguez was beaten in the final of the 2016 Alcalas Open by Julio Barbero.\nRodríguez quit the PDC in January 2017."

        "text": "The 2007 Indoor Cricket World Cup was an Indoor Cricket tournament that took place in Bristol, England from 22 to 29 September 2007 involving both a men's and a women's division. There were a total of 35 matches played in the men's division and 26 matches played in the women's division.\nThe men's division was split into two stages (in addition to finals) with each side playing each other once before being split into two groups, the top four and the bottom three. The top four sides progressed to a Super 4's stage where they again played each other once in order to be ranked for the semi-finals. The semi finals featured Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa with Australia defeating South Africa in the final to record their sixth consecutive World Cup. The top three sides contested a subsidiary title, won by England.\nWhilst the women's division was not split into separate stages it did employ a more complicated semi final system that gave all five nations the opportunity of progressing through to the final during the finals stage. South Africa advanced straight through to the final after defeating Australia in the semi-finals stage, though Australia then prevailed over New Zealand and were able to reverse their semi final result to defeat South Africa in the final. This was the fifth consecutive World Cup for Australia.\nThe 2007 Junior World Series of Indoor Cricket was held alongside this event.\nHost Selection.\nThe World Cup was awarded to England by the WICF at the conclusion of the previous World Cup. As a result, England became the first nation to host the World Cup twice having held the first tournament in 1995.\nVenue.\nThe England Indoor Cricket Association determined that the Action Indoor Sports Stadium in Bristol would host all World Cup matches and Bristol became the host city as a result. All World Cup matches were played at the same venue.\nParticipants.\nMen's Division\nIndia were also initially entered in the men's division but were late withdrawals from the competition.\nWomen's Division\nRound Robin tournament.\nMen's Division\nWomen's Division\nSuper 4's Stage.\nThe top four sides at the conclusion of the round robin series progressed through to the Super 4 stage of the tournament. The bottom three sides were relegated to the \"World Cup Plate\" division and, together with the team that finished 4th after the Super 4's stage, competed for a separate subordinate trophy.\nMen's Division – Top Four\nMen's Division – Bottom Three\nWomen's Division\nThere was no Super 4's stage in the women's division.\nSemi finals.\nThe World Cup finals operated under a different format in each division. In the men's division the winner of the two semi finals proceeded to the final and the remaining two sides competed for the bronze medal match.\nThe World Cup Plate final was contested between the loser of the bronze medal match and the highest ranked side from the bottom three during the Super 4's stage.\nThe women's division employed a slightly more complicated format. The fourth and fifth placed sides faced off against one another with the winner taking on third place to earn a right in the preliminary final. The top two sides competed in a major semi final with the winner progressing to the final and the loser taking the second spot in the preliminary final. The remaining spot in the World Cup final was assumed by the winner of the preliminary final.\nMen's Division\n\"Semi-final 1 (1st vs 4th) – winner to final, loser to bronze medal match\"\n\"Semi-final 2 (2nd vs 3rd) – winner to final, loser to bronze medal match\"\n\"Bronze Medal Match – winner receives bronze medal, loser to World Cup Plate final\"\nWomen's Division\n\"Major Semi-final (1st vs 2nd) – winner to final, loser to preliminary final\"\n\"Qualifying Final (3rd vs 5th) – winner to minor semi final, loser knocked out\"\n\"Minor Semi-final – winner to preliminary final, loser knocked out\"\n\"Preliminary Final – winner to final, loser knocked out\"\nFinals.\nMen's Division\n\"World Cup\"The World Cup final was contested between Australia and South Africa. This final was the sixth consecutive appearance in a World Cup final and was the first for South Africa. Despite performing below expectations early in the tournament, Australia easily accounted for England in their semi final. The South African side, on the other hand, came through a tough encounter with the New Zealand side by just three runs.\nIn the end, Australia managed a narrow but comfortable victory to claim their sixth consecutive title.\n\"World Cup Plate\"A secondary and subordinate final was played between England (the loser of the bronze medal match) and France (the highest ranked side from the bottom three teams). England rebounded from their heavy loss against New Zealand in the bronze medal match to claim the first Plate title.\nWomen's Division\nThe Women's World Cup Final featured Australia and South Africa. South Africa entered the side as favourites having accounted for Australia in all but one of their encounters in the earlier stages of the World Cup. Australia, however, rebounded and managed to claim their fifth consecutive World Cup title.\nPlayer of the tournament.\nNineteen year old Lee Irwin of Australia was awarded player of the tournament."

        "title": "Italian Basketball Supercup",
        "text": "The Italian Basketball Supercup (), also known as Discovery+ Supercoppa for sponsorship reasons, is a professional basketball super cup competition. From the 2020 Supercup edition, all the teams of LBA took part in the competition. Created in 1995, it is organised by the Lega Basket – who run the LBA and the Italian Cup – in partnership with RCS Sport, and it traditionally opens the season.\nHistory.\nThe 2014 edition of the Supercup was played on October 4 and 5, at Sassari's PalaSerradimigni, in a final four format. Italian League and Italian Cup runners-up Montepaschi Siena (also defending champions), did not participate, after declaring bankruptcy over the summer. Italian League champions EA7 Emporio Armani Milano, comfortably dispatched Enel Brindisi (third in the 2014 cup), by a score of 71–59, in the first semifinal, on the back of Linas Kleiza's and Joe Ragland's long-distance shooting (17 and 16 points respectively), in a mistake-strewn game.\nThe other semifinal saw cup-holders Banco di Sardegna Sassari, have an easy 89–73 win over Acea Roma (league semifinalist), with the hosts always leading, and Sassari head coach Romeo Sacchetti, rotating his squad.\nThe final saw Sassari add a second title to their prior cup win, by downing Milano 96–88. The Sardinians started the game on the front foot, leading the first quarter, 29–14, while Milano struggled to score (0-for-6 from three). They continued to drive the game at the start of the second quarter, but Milano found a way back into the game, thanks to stronger defense and a stellar MarShon Brooks, to answer with a 15–0 run from, 36-18 down, with Sassari then finding their scoring shoes to finish the half 50–40. Three's from Ragland and Kleiza helped Milano claw back at the lead, but Brooks missed the shot to equalise, with the quarter ending on 72–68. Sassari would stay in front for the rest of the game, with Supercup MVP Jerome Dyson entertaining the fans. Brooks led all scorers with 26 points, followed for Milano by Ragland (17) and Kleizia (16), whilst Dyson paced the winners with 25, and three other players had 14 points.\nThe 2015 edition took place in Turin's PalaRuffini, on 26 and 27 September. It pitted Banco di Sardegna Sassari (both league and cup holders) against Grissin Bon Reggio Emilia (league runners-up) and EA7 Emporio Armani Milano (cup finalist and league semifinalist) against Umana Reyer Venezia (league semifinalist) in the semifinals.\nFormat.\nIn 2000, the Supercup was organised on a bigger scale, with all but one of the Serie A and Serie A2 teams participating (Viola Reggio Calabria were caught up in a tournament in Buenos Aires), with the league and cup holders already qualified for the semifinals.\nThe next year, the four best-ranked teams in the league took part in a Supercup final four.\nThe 2014 edition saw the Supercup contested by four squads, with the league champion playing the runner up of the cup, and the cup winner playing the league regular season runner-up (barring that, the next best placed team in the cup and the league are chosen in that order).\nThe format was confirmed for the following editions.\nIn 2020 edition all the teams of LBA took part in the Supercup, due to the early conclusion of the 2019–20 LBA season caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The competition consists of 4 round robin groups that qualify 4 teams to the Final Four that was held in Bologna at the Segafredo Arena.\nThe format was confirmed for the 2021 edition, with a Final Eight in place of a Final Four.\nMedia scrutiny.\nSome observers have derided the Italian Basketball Supercup as a, \"minor trophy\", in contrast to the Italian Cup. Journalist's such as the Corriere di Bologna's, Daniele Labanti, and Panorama's Paolo Corio, reacted to the low spectator turnout at the 2014 edition (as part of a general trend), organised in Sassari, by unfavorably comparing its appeal to that of the top level Italian league, the top level Italian Cup, and the EuroLeague (in which the home team would be involved).\nThe formula and venue was also criticised, with calls to organise a single final, in a city bereft of a professional club basketball (such as Bari or Palermo), or even abroad, in the manner of the Italian football Supercup.\nTitle holders.\nMens Sana are the record-holders with seven cups, Treviso and Milano follow with four titles, Virtus Bologna have participated in the most finals (11), winning the cup three times."

He won four caps for Wales and was part of the Welsh side that faced the touring South Africans in 1931.\nDavies was originally a rugby scrum-half and centre, before moving into the forward, and eventually settling as a flanker. He faced the South Africans twice during their 1931 tour of Britain, once with Wales and once with Swansea. In the Swansea game, Davies set up his team's only score when he snapped up a loose ball, that broke loose after a South African tackle. He punted the ball forward for Claude Davey to beat the covering Springbok players to collect it and score a try.\nInternational rugby.\nDavies was first selected for Wales to face the South Africans in 1931 and although Wales lost the match 8–3, Davies scored the only Welsh points with a try. Davies showed considerable skill and maturity in a debut game when he timed his move on a loose ball to pick the correct bounce to kick the ball forward and then successfully chase it over the line. Davies was back in the 1932 Home Nations Championship and was chosen to play against England at St Helens. Under the captaincy of Jack Bassett, Wales won the game 12–5, and three weeks later was chosen to face Scotland. His final game for Wales was against Ireland in a Championship decider that was lost when the normally dependable Jack Bassett missed the game's final conversion.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "The men's rope climbing event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1932 Summer Olympics. It was contested for the fourth and last time after 1896, 1904, and 1924. The competition was held on Wednesday, August 10, 1932. Five gymnasts from two nations competed. All three medalists were from the host nation, as Americans Raymond Bass, William Galbraith, and Thomas F. Connolly took the honors (in that order).\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth and final appearance of the event, which had been held in 1896, 1904, and 1924. The event was an unusual one, not one of the standard apparatus competitions held at the world championships. It had been left off the programme in 1928 when other apparatus events were held (no specific apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). It was more commonly seen in the United States (hosting the 1932 Games) than internationally; the two competitors from Hungary (the only international gymnasts) were unfamiliar with the event.\nThe United States made its third appearance in the event (1904 and 1924), while Hungary made its debut.\nCompetition format.\nThe rope climbing event was judged on time, with the fastest to reach the top winning. As in 1904, each competitor received three attempts. The rope this time was 8 metres high (rather than the 25 feet of 1904). None of the apparatus events in 1932 were aggregated into the individual or team all-around scores, instead being entirely separate competitions.\nResults.\nEvery competitor had the possibility of three trials with the results based on the best time; the Hungarians did not make any attempts after the first, seeing their times in the first round so much slower than the Americans.\nAll figures in seconds."

Designed by noted course architect Pete Dye, it opened for play in September 1989 and was the home venue of the Sun Devils golf teams.\nKarsten Golf Course closed on May 5, 2019, in order to be developed into sports fields. ASU moved their golf course to the nearby Papago Golf Course after striking a 30-year management agreement with the City of Phoenix, Papago's owner.\nCreation.\nPrivately funded, the largest single contributor was Karsten Solheim (1911–2000), the founder of Phoenix-based PING golf clubs. The clubhouse and ASU players' facility\nwere completed in November 1994. It was located at the northeast edge of campus, east of Sun Devil Stadium. The elevation of the course is approximately above sea level.\nHistory.\nThe course was considered to many as the \"Home of Champions,\" referring to ASU's strong collegiate golf program's national titles; twice in men's (1990 and 1996) and seven times in women's (1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2009).

The short par-four 4th hole, the tough par-four 9th, the dauntingly long par-three 16th ( from the tips) or the ill humor par-four 18th, guarded by water down the left side, was considered one of the toughest finishing holes in the state. The course hosted tournaments, including the collegiate Men’s and Women’s Pac-10 and NCAA Championships, Phoenix Thunderbirds Collegiate Invitational, PING Invitational, and U.S. Open Qualifying."

        "text": "Joe Simpson (born 5 July 1988) is a rugby union player who plays scrum half who plays for Sale Sharks in the Premiership Rugby. He most recently played for Gloucester, between 2006 and 2019 he played 230 times for Wasps, in 2011 he played one international for and was named in the 2011 Rugby World Cup squad. He has also represented Team GB in rugby sevens.\nEarly life.\nSimpson was born in Australia to a New Zealand mother and English father, both rugby enthusiasts. He has one younger brother called Michael.\nSimpson was educated at St Benedict's School, Ealing, which he represented at both rugby and cricket and where he was honoured as Victor Ludorum for athletics three times, at junior, middle and senior school levels. Outside school he played cricket for Ealing Cricket Club and played with Hugo Ellis and Dominic Waldouck, in the youth team at Richmond Rugby Club.\nIn addition to his parents Simpson cites Mike Reilly and Alun Powell, his coaches at Richmond and the Wasps Academy respectively, as influences.\nClub career.\nSimpson joined the Wasps England Rugby Academy full-time from St Benedict's School in the summer of 2006, but spent much of the subsequent two years at Blackheath Rugby Club on loan.\nIn the 2008/09 season Simpson graduated to the Wasps first team, coming on as a substitute a number of times and gaining a more frequent position in the starting XV towards the latter part of the season. He scored on his debut and was awarded fourth place in the Guinness Premiership Try of the Season award.\nSimpson signed a full-time senior contract with Wasps in the summer of 2009 securing his place at the club for two years. He was in the starting line-up for the opening game of the season on 5 September 2009 against Harlequins, played at Twickenham as part of the London Double Header . In the first minute Simpson was head-butted by George Robson, the Harlequins' lock, in an off-the-ball incident. After treatment on the field for a cut sustained to his nose Simpson continued to play for the remaining 79 minutes, despite feeling sick and dizzy.\nOn 17 December 2010, Wasps announced that Simpson had signed a three-year extension to his contract which will keep him at the club until the end of the 2013/14 season.\nSimpson underwent surgery after suffering an ankle injury in Wasps' 51-10 European Champions Cup win over Leinster on 23 January 2016.\n\"It is obviously disappointing for everyone that Joe has had to undergo surgery on his ankle, especially at a time when he was playing so well. I'm sure he was knocking on the door for international recognition.\" said Wasps boss Dai Young.\nSimpson's injury, just a week before the start of the Six Nations, ends any hopes he might have had of getting an England recall this season under new coach Eddie Jones. This is Simpson's second major injury in less than a year, having been stretchered off in the 26–21 home defeat by Leicester in May 2015 with a medial collateral ligament blow, dashing his hopes of making the World Cup squad.\nOn 6 February 2019, it was confirmed that Simpson would move to Gloucester in time for the 2019–20 season.\nIn September 2021, Saracens announced Simpson would join them on a one-month loan deal from Gloucester to provide additional cover following Ivan van Zyl suspension as well as Ruben de Haas being away on international duty. This was followed by a three-month loan to Bath.\nAfter he left Gloucester, it was confirmed on 20 July 2022, that he signed a six-month deal to join Sale Sharks from the 2022-23 season. Following this he will retire from rugby.\nSimpson has since turned out for Old Priorian RFC (formed from the old boys of St Benedict's School) 2nd XV, and played alongside his brother Michael as part of an Invitational XV versus an Ealing Trailfinders Academy XV managed by Jonah Holmes. \nInternational career.\nIn May 2006 Simpson earned his first cap in the England Under 19 team, playing against Wales.\nIn the 2007/08 season he secured a place with the England sevens' side, travelling to Dubai for the IRB World Seven Series tournament, and was also named in the England Under 20s squad. At the end of the season he was nominated for the 'IRB Young Player of the Year Award' for his performance in the IRB Junior World Championship in June 2008.\nIn June 2009 Simpson progressed into the England Saxons squad and travelled with Wasps' teammates Dom Waldouck and Danny Cipriani to play in the Churchill Cup in Colorado. On his debut he completed a solo try and was awarded Man of the Match and appeared twice more during the tournament (in which the Saxons lost the final to Ireland A), coming on as a substitute.\nFollowing his performance at the 2009 Churchill Cup Simpson was selected for the 2009/10 squad for the England Saxons national rugby union team.\nOn 11 May 2010 Simpson was one of nine uncapped players named in the England senior squad to tour Australia and New Zealand in the summer and on 30 May he made his debut for England, coming on as a substitute for David Strettle with nine minutes remaining in the match against the Barbarians. However, having sustained an injury to his left hamstring in the Barbarians game the RFU announced that Simpson would have to pull out of the tour.\nOn 12 January 2011, it was announced that Simpson had been called up to the senior England squad (EPS) for the 6 Nations tournament.\nOn 22 August 2011 Simpson was named in the 30-man England squad heading to New Zealand for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, the opportunity arising following an injury to Danny Care. On 18 September 2011, Simpson replaced Ben Youngs in the 66th minute against Georgia in the pool stages of the Rugby World Cup 2011 to win his long anticipated first cap. He was only the second player to win his first cap for England in a Rugby World cup tournament – second to Joe Worsley who was the first player to do so at the 1999 Rugby World Cup."

        "title": "Golf de Granville Baie du Mont St Michel",
        "text": "The Golf de Granville Baie du Mont St Michel is a 27-hole golf course located at Bréville-sur-Mer (Manche), approximately 4 miles north of Granville, Normandy, France.\nThe course was first laid out in 1912 and then totally redisgned by Harry Colt in 1921. This is the only true links course in France. In addition to the main 18-hole course, there is a nine-hole, par-33 links course established in 1986 which is notable for its testing greens.\nHistory.\nIn 1910, a local hotel company began negotiations to rent land in the Bréville dunes from the Granville town council. The first 9 holes were begun by a group of local enthusiasts in 1912 with a view to a further 9 holes to be added later. The Cercle des Sports took charge of the new course, which was not officially inaugurated until July 5, 1914, although it had been in play for two years by then. The First World War soon put a stop to play, and a part of the course was requisitioned by the local garrison. After the war Granville grew in popularity as a resort, and so the course needed to be upgraded. Thus in 1921 plans were laid and work was begun under the supervision of Harry Colt, the famed English golf architect. Colt made good use of the magnificent dune landscape to design one of the largest courses in Europe at that time. A visit in 1922 by the renowned specialist in golf course design, Martin Sutton, confirmed the natural quality of the linksland. He was so impressed by what he saw on his visit across the channel that he wrote: 'the site is a golfing paradise ... I doubt if there's a course even in England or Scotland that has a more favourable natural situation.' The Granville links is a magnificent example of Harry Colt's work as a golf course designer. During World War Two the club house was requisitioned and the course closed by the occupying army. In 1957, a small group of golfers restored the course to its original layout. The course is much changed since then, with only a dozen of the original holes remaining. However, the newer holes do largely follow the original layout. Despite these changes, the course still challenges players of all standards and especially in the wind – just as on the links of Scotland or Ireland.\nThe designer, Christian Dior, was born in Granville and played golf at the Golf de Granville. When he came back from doing his military service in 1928, he organised a small competition for a few of his friends. This idea was taken up by the club in 1973 and since then a competition has been held in his honour each year - La Coupe Dior, of which a photo can be seen below in the gallery.\nIn 2008, the course was once again the venue for a national championship, the Mid Amateur (+35 years of age). \nThe first photo in the gallery shows the 17th green during this championship which was held at Granville in September 2008."

During World War II he was evacuated to the north-east of England and, after the war, was hospitalised for 14 months due to tuberculosis. He started refereeing matches in 1960. His first professional refereeing role was at the 1974 World Snooker Championship and his first televised match was during the 1978 Masters. He worked for the Pearl Assurance company as an insurance agent for 18 years until leaving the role to focus on refereeing professionally. Before becoming an insurance agent, he had worked as an apprentice engineer, as a salesperson at a tailor and in a betting shop.\nHis final match was at the 1997 Benson &amp; Hedges Masters final when Steve Davis defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 10–8 after trailing 4–8. This match was interrupted by a woman streaking.\nStreet refereed in five World Championship finals between 1980 and 1995. He handled the 1992 final between Jimmy White and Stephen Hendry when Hendry came from 8–14 behind to win the match 18–14 by winning 10 consecutive frames.\nStreet was co-author of several snooker rule books. He died from lung disease in Exeter in 2009 aged 77. Street was married to Jean in 1953, and they had three children."

        "text": "A drop kick in rugby union is a type of kick that involves someone dropping a ball and then kicking when it hits the ground, in contrast to a punt wherein the dropper kicks the ball without letting it hit the ground first.\nIn rugby union, a drop kick is used for the kick-off and restarts and to score a field or drop goal. Originally it was one of only two ways to score points, along with the place kick. \nDrop kicks are mandatory:\nDrop kicks are optional:\nAdditionally, in rugby sevens, the drop kick is used for all conversion attempts which must be taken within 40 seconds of the try being scored.\nTechnique.\nThe drop kick technique in rugby union is to hold the ball with one end pointing downwards in two hands above the kicking leg, and the fingers pointing to the ground. The ball is dropped onto the ground in front of the kicking foot, which makes contact at the moment or fractionally after the ball touches the ground, called the \"half-volley\". The kicking foot usually makes contact with the ball slightly on the instep.\nIn a rugby union kick-off or drop out, the kicker usually aims to kick the ball very high but not a great distance, and so usually strikes the ball after it has started to bounce upwards off the ground, so the contact is made close to the bottom of the ball.\nFor the tactics of the drop goal in open play (field goal), see drop goal."

        "title": "Penalty (rugby union)",
        "text": "A penalty in rugby union is the main disciplinary sanction available to the referee to penalise a team who commit deliberate infringements. The team who did not commit the infringement are given possession of the ball and they may either kick it towards touch (in which case the ball back rule is waived), attempt a place kick at goal, or tap the ball with their foot and run. It is also sometimes used as shorthand for \"penalty goal\".\nReasons to award a penalty.\nThe referee signals that he has awarded a penalty to a side by raising his arm at 45 degrees between vertical and horizontal and blowing a blast on his whistle. The arm is raised on the side that won the penalty. Penalties may be awarded for a number of offences, including:\nReferees may not penalise some of these infringements if in their judgement the offending player had no intent to break the rules (e.g. a marginally late tackle on a player who has just kicked or passed the ball) or if the offending player was not participating in or affecting the game (e.g. a player who is in an offside position but not interfering with play). Equally, a referee may warn a team about technical infringements (especially at the scrum and ruck) before penalising them. A referee's willingness and ability to do so is a mark of good officiating in that it reduces stoppages in the game and allows the game to \"flow\".\nRestart options.\nThe side that is awarded the penalty restarts the game with a kick or scrum at their option. If a kick is taken, the side that the penalty was awarded against must retreat 10 metres (or to their goal line if closer). There are four ways of restarting the game:\nCross-code comparisons.\nOne of the laws associated with penalties was experimented with in association football, that being that penalties may be moved 10 metres forward of their original position either due to talk-back from the players or offside from a quick tap penalty. This was dropped after variable application by referees, but remains a rugby union rule.\nA similar rule exists in Australian Rules: the 50-metre penalty moves the mark the approximate distance of a long mark, and is awarded for dissent and for slowing down or disrupting the restart."

        "title": "Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium",
        "text": "Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium is an international cricket stadium in Pune, Maharashtra, India. It is owned and operated by the Maharashtra Cricket Association.\nIt is the home ground of the Maharashtra cricket team and Maharashtra women's cricket team, it is the headquarters of the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA). The stadium is situated on the outskirts of city limit of Pune in Gahunje village near Mumbai–Pune Expressway. It is one of the premier stadiums of the country. Before its existence, Nehru Stadium of downtown Pune was the home ground of the Maharashtra Cricket team and venue for international matches organised by MCA.\nMCA stadium was designed by Michael Hopkins of Hopkins architects. Its seating capacity is 42,700. Arena's shape is like a deep bowl. The venue hosted its first ever international match in December 2012. Its ground's shape is round, with Bermuda grass surface. The ground has high-tech pop-up sprinklers. \nIts final phase of construction is still yet to be completed. The stadium's 75% seating area still does not have a roof. It has floodlights to organise games at night.\nOn 1 April 2012, then ICC president Sharad Pawar inaugurated the MCA stadium. The arena hosted its first ever first class match in December 2011, when Himachal Pradesh played against home side Maharashtra cricket team in 2011-12 Ranji trophy edition, hosted first IPL game (Pune Warriors v King's XI Punjab) in April 2012. MCA stadium hosted its first ever T20I match in December 2012 (between India-England) and first ever Test in February 2017.\nThe arena hosted 5 games of 2023 ICC World Cup including the India - Bangladesh game.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe MCA's decision to build a new Cricket stadium in Pune stemmed from a dispute with the Pune Municipal Corporation, regarding ticket allocations for Nehru Stadium. This conflict came to a head when an international match between India and Sri Lanka was moved to Kolkata, with the MCA stating they were in no position to host the match. Following this, the MCA decided a new stadium was needed.\nConstruction.\nThe groundbreaking ceremony was performed on the construction site on 21 October 2007 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar. MCA granted the contract to construct the first phase of the construction to Shapoorji Pallonji &amp; Co. Ltd in November 2009. The construction work started on 14 November 2007. The stadium is designed by British architect Sir Michael Hopkins of Hopkins Architects, who also credited to designed Lord's mount stand and Ages bowl stadium of Southampton, England. The project's original deadline was November 2010 with cost of ₹ 1.50 billion, covering an area of . The construction of the stadium was held from 2010 to 2012, it faced various problems before complition in December 2011. Although it's claimed that major part of the stadium is built, the final phase of the construction is still yet to complete, 75% stands do not have roof and final phase of building is yet to started as of September 2023.\nMaharashtra Cricket Association intended to host matches of 2011 World Cup, due to construction delayed, it was not able to do that.\nThe stadium and the seating arrangement were designed in such a way that an unobstructed view is assured from each location.The most important feature of this stadium is its rainwater drainage system. Often, matches are abandoned due to heavy downpour to overcome this problem, MCA opted for a sand-based outfield developed departmentally with technical assistance from \"STRI Limited\", UK. Due to this technology, even during heavy showers, water on the outfield drains out fast, making it ready for play again just in few minutes.Zeolite supplied by G M Chemicals are used for Turf management.\nIt was inaugurated in a ceremony by the then ICC President and nation's Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar on 1 April 2012. Maharashtra's chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, deputy CM Ajit Pawar was invited.\nIn 2013, the Indian company Sahara India Pariwar bought the naming rights of the stadium, by virtue it was renamed as \"Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium”. However, the name was changed back to the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium because Sahara paid only a part of the ₹ 200 crore that it had promised when acquiring the rights.\nBegan hosting games.\nBefore official inauguration, the stadium hosted a Ranji trophy match between Himachal Pradesh- Maharashtra on 21 December 2011 and some practice games. In November 2015, the stadium was selected as the new Test venue of the country. It hosted its first ever Test match in February 2017, it was the 1st match of the four match series, Steve Smith became first batter to score a test century in the stadium, Steve O'Keefe took six wickets in each inning, Australia won by 333 runs.\nIn the 2010s, it served as the home ground for Pune Warriors India, Rising Pune Supergiant and Chennai Super Kings in different time.\nIn 2015 IPL, Punjab Kings decided to move out of Mohali due to lukewarm spectator response at their primary home ground. Following the decision three home games were played at Pune.\nIn 2018 IPL, due to members of some political parties protested outside the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, political parties of Chennai demanded the IPL matches to be moved out of the city until the Cauvery Management Board was set up as directed by the honourable Supreme Court of India. Additionally Chennai police expressed that they are unable to provide stadium sequrity. Chennai Super Kings relocated its remaining games to MCA stadium.\nOn 28 March 2021, MCA hosted its 50th game.\nControversy.\nIn 2017, Indian TV network \"India Today\" exposed this stadium's official pitch curator Salgaonkar in a sting operation. The network alleged Salgaonkar for malpractice before India vs New Zealand ODI match of New Zealand tour of India. In response to that Mahrashtra Cricket Association sacked Salgaonkar from the job. According to \"'cricket.com.au\"', the pitch curator showed batting pitch to the men around the Pune, which is clear breach of the ICC rule governing access to the Cricket pitch in international cricket matches. The second ODI went ahead on schedule after the pitch had been inspected by match referee Chris Broad. The India Today footage of Salgaonkar speaking with a reporter, who was posing as a bookmaker, was broadcast a few hours before the match. India Today alleged that Salgaonkar shared information about the wicket to their undercover reporter about possible scores and Salgaonkar was ready to tamper wicket for bounce. As per India Today their undercover reporter accompanied by Salgaonkar was permitted to tap, walk, and stamp on the pitch. The curator guaranteed to doctor the pitch according to demand.\nSalgaonkar was suspended for 6 months from the curator position by BCCI and ICC, after that he returned on the job at MCA as curator.\nIn 2017, the pitch used for the first test of India vs Australia series was rated poor by ICC match referee Chris Broad in his match report.\nIn 2018 Bombay High court restricted Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) from using Pavana river water for the maintenance of this stadium's ground. The court gave this verdict in response to a Public interest litigation field by a NGO, Loksatta movement. Maharashtra government granted the permission to use the water of Pavana river for industrial purpose to MCA. The judges of Bombay High court said that, \"We are shocked to note that for a period of six years, the state government has allowed the MCA to draw water from the Pavana river for industrial purposes when admittedly the MCA is not running any industry. The water is being used for the stadium” and to do so was illegal.\nDomestic cricket.\nThe arena has hosted many domestic tournaments such as Ranji trophy, IPL and Women's T20 Challenge etc. In December 2011 the MCA stadium hosted its first ever first class match, when Himachal Pradesh played against home team Maharashtra in 2011-12 Ranji trophy. In 2023 it hosted the inaugural season of the Maharashtra Premier League (MPL). The league has 6 teams, Maharashtra Cricket Association organise it. In January 2016, the stadium hosted Ranji trophy final. It hosted the first semifinal of 2017-18 Ranji between Delhi and Bengal, Delhi won the game by an innig and 26 runs. Before the venue was built, Neharu stadium in downtown hosted the domestic tournaments. 1930s-1990s Deccan Gymkhana Ground has hosted many first-class matches in the city. National Defence Academy's ground in Khadakwasala has also hosted first class games in the city. After inauguration in 2012, MCA stadium served as home venue of IPL franchise Sahara Pune Warriors. The arena also was allocated as home ground of Chennai Super Kings during an IPL season. It was home ground of Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016–17. The entire edition of 2022 IPL was held in Maharashtra, and as a result MCA stadium hosted a significant amount of games of it.\nICC World Cup matches.\nThe Maharashtra cricket association stadium is scheduled to host 5 matches of 2023 ICC World Cup including India–Bangladesh on 19 October. It is the first time that the arena will host the world cup. It was in contention to host 2011 WC's games but was not able to do that due to construction delays. The city of Pune has hosted a game each in 1987 and 1996 World Cup between Sri Lanka–England and Kenya–West Indies respectively at the Swargate's Nehru stadium."

        "text": "American flag rugby (AFR) is a mixed-gender, non-contact version of rugby union played in the United States, and is a variant of the sport Tag Rugby. American flag rugby is designed for American children entering grades K–9. The organization itself exists to provide free start up kits and support to any community looking to add a youth rugby program to their community. The program has received great praise in the USA including an article in Rugby magazine and a spot on Fox Sports Net. The initial program from Morris County has helped create various other programs start up and now encompasses thousands of kids and adults across America participating in the youth sport and starting up programs.\nOverview.\nAmerican flag rugby is divided up among four different levels based upon the grade level a child is entering. The four levels are:\nEach division itself has a unique set of rules in recognition that there will be different ability levels between the various age groups. The game, while based on rugby union, is actually far more related to rugby sevens. Similarities are seen with the number of players on the field and the arrangement of the line-outs, scrums, and kick-offs. Like rugby union, games are played in halves but the halves are significantly reduced. The halves are the same for all four levels at 10 minutes each instead of 40 minutes each.\nThe rule differences between each division are minor and gradually shift closer towards rugby union rules as the child advances up in divisions and increases his or her skill set. For Owls the game typically revolves around teaching the children to run with the ball, learning to touch the ball down when scoring a try, and learning basic passing skills. Nothing is contested, there is no kicking, and there are no conversions. However, when children reach the Eagle level, many of the prior mentioned restrictions are removed and the children play with contest, are allowed open field kicking, and the game has a more dynamic flow to it.\nHistory.\nThe first iteration of American flag rugby was founded by Tom Feury in 1998. Feury was initially looking for nothing more than a way to get his children and their friends introduced to the game. In 1999 the town of Denville granted him access to a field in order to do so. The first year began with only one team and 28 children."

        "title": "2008–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2008–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in competitive college basketball during the 2008–09 NCAA Division I season. The 2008–09 season marked the team's ninety-second consecutive season as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Big Ten Conference. The team finished the season with a 21–14 overall record and a 9–9 conference record. The 9–9 conference record tied for seventh place in the 2008–09 Big Ten conference standings. Michigan was seeded seventh in the single-elimination 2009 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament where it advanced one round. They were seeded tenth in the South Regional bracket of the single-elimination 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where it also advanced one round before losing to the Blake Griffin-led Oklahoma Sooners. Jevohn Shepherd and David Merritt served as team co-captains, and Manny Harris and DeShawn Sims shared team MVP honors.\nThe 2008–09 season marked a turnaround for the team for several reasons. The team rebounded from a 10–22 overall record and a 5–13 conference record during the previous 2007–08 season. The season was highlighted by the team's first two wins in eleven years against teams ranked among the top five in the AP Poll, and by the team's first trip to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament since the 1998 tournament. Although the team had appeared in the 1998 NCAA tournament, the last appearance in the NCAA tournament that had been recognized in official NCAA records as not having been tainted by the University of Michigan basketball scandal was their 1995 tournament appearance. The team was in its first year off scholarship probation, which following the scandal had restricted the number of available scholarships. However, the team continued to be prohibited from affiliating with implicated athletes (Chris Webber, Robert Traylor, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock) until 2012, which meant, among other things, that the players could not help the university recruit. The team began the season unranked, but in December 2008 it earned its first place in the top 25 since February 2006. As the season progressed, the team adopted the slogan \"Queme los barcos\", which is Spanish for \"burn the ships\", as a reminder that there was no turning back.\nFor the forty-second consecutive season, the team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the Crisler Arena, which has a capacity of 13,751. John Beilein was in his second season as head coach with the team during the 2008–2009 season. At the conclusion of the season, guard Manny Harris was named to the All-Big Ten first team, and forward DeShawn Sims was selected by the Big Ten media to the second team and chosen by the Big Ten coaches for the third team.\nPreview.\nTheir 2008–09 pre-conference schedule included Atlantic Coast Conference members Maryland Terrapins and Duke Blue Devils, who went on to win the 2009 ACC men's basketball tournament. The team also played against geographical rival Eastern Michigan and the preseason #2 ranked Connecticut Huskies.\nUnlike conference rivals Michigan State, Purdue, and Wisconsin, Michigan was not ranked in the top 25 by either the Associated Press or the ESPN/USA Today preseason polls. In fact, the team did not even receive any votes, like rival Ohio State, in either poll. Pre season reports described the team as a contender for fifth place in the conference. Although the team was building from a 10–22 record, it won five of its last ten games the prior year. A poll of 22 members of the media published in the \"Detroit Free Press\" ranked Michigan eighth in the conference. The \"Sports Illustrated\" 2008 College Basketball Preview issue did not select the team as one of the five predicted Big Ten teams (the four mentioned above and the Minnesota Golden Gophers) to qualify for the NCAA tournament.\nRoster.\nOn May 5, 2008, sophomore Ekpe Udoh, the Big Ten's top shotblocker, decided to transfer for his final two years of athletic eligibility. Beilein attempted to replace Udoh with Robin Benzing, a member of Germany's national youth team. However, Benzing failed to meet the NCAA's initial-eligibility guidelines and did not play. Beilein was able to partially solve the problem of complimenting Manny Harris by luring point guard Laval Lucas-Perry to transfer from Arizona. Perry became eligible to play at the conclusion of the fall semester. The team anticipated relying on freshman center Ben Cronin to make up for the loss of Udoh and Ron Coleman, who averaged over 21 minutes each of his four seasons. Including Cronin, the team had three incoming recruits.\nMichigan granted two of its scholarships to fifth-year redshirt graduate students C.J. Lee and David Merritt in September. Lee and Merritt had both been 2007–08 Big Ten Academic All-Conference selections. The varsity roster included fourteen players, thirteen of whom saw live game action. In December, the Wolverines made the decision to redshirt Ben Cronin after only 10 minutes of play. He had hip surgery on January 14.\n – denotes class status adjusted for used redshirt eligibility. \nIncoming signees.\nThe incoming class had no four- or five-star recruits. However, it included three players that Rivals.com listed as three-star recruits. Only Ben Cronin was also listed as three-star by scout.com.\n2009–10 team recruits.\nIncoming recruit Darius Morris and two Division I recruit teammates led Windward High School to the California Division V state title. Darius Morris received MVP of Olympic League, CIF Division 5A Southern Section Player of Year, and CIF Division 5A State Player of Year. Also Darius was awarded a John Wooden High School Player of the Year Award, received by Jrue Holiday the year before and the likes of Jason Kapono and Tayshaun Prince in the past.\nMatt Vogrich won the Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year award, following in the footsteps of Derrick Rose and Jon Scheyer. Unlike Scheyer and Rose, he did not win Illinois Mr. Basketball. Kelvin Grady announced his intent to transfer at the end of the season.\nPlaying style.\nOver the course of the season, they developed a reputation for shooting a lot of three-point shots and for not turning over the basketball. The team ranked among the national leaders in three-point shots made per game. The ballhandling ability was a function of the Michigan lineup which often employed four guards and one center/forward, which meant that at any time the team had several adept ballhandlers on the court. By the end of the season, the starting lineup usually included four players or shorter and Sims who is . As a team that relied on the three-point shot, it was streaky and was susceptible to hot and cold stretches. The team relied on a deep bench and had 10 players who averaged 10 minutes per game. Even the eleventh player averaged 9.6 minutes. The offense used patient ball movement with backdoor cutters and slashers, which necessitated that defenses chase shooters and peel off picks. The offense resulted in a shot mix that employed three-pointers for about 48% of its shots.\nOn defense, the team was known for employing Beilein's trademark trapping 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which required opponents to be skilled at perimeter passing. The zone defense was generally employed after made baskets and dead-ball situations. After offensive misses or turnovers, the Wolverines relied on man-to-man defense. Depending on the matchups the team also used a 2–3 zone defense because the team did not have the type of athletes necessary to play on the wings of his 1–3–1. It employed the 1–3–1 less later in the season, and about ten percent of opponent possessions altogether. In total, the team used some sort of zone defense about 40 percent of the time. The team was also among the top 35 (of over 300) in the nation in terms of three-point shot defense.\nAccomplishments.\nOn December 13, 2008, the team tied Dartmouth's current national record for most different players to make a three-point field goal in game set in 1993 when 9 players made three-point shots against Eastern Michigan. The team also set the current Big Ten Conference single-game three-point field goals attempted record of 42 on December 22, 2008, against Florida Gulf Coast and the conference games record of 40 on January 7, 2009, against Indiana. Over the course of the season the team set the current Big Ten Conference single-season three-point field goals attempted record if 912 as well as the single-season conference games record of 471. The team led the Big Ten Conference with 151 three-point field goals made in conference games.\nThe team set several school records. Its single-season total of 305 three-point field goals made surpassed the 1998 school record total of 260. This record was surpassed by the 2013–14 team. The team's single-game total of 16 three-point field goals made against Eastern Michigan on December 13, 2008, surpassed the school record 15 made on February 22, 1998. The team also established the school's single-season free throw percentage record of 75.7% (412–544) surpassed the 75.4% set in 2002.\nSeason.\nPreconference.\nAlthough the Big Ten Network had a two and a half hour special that featured Midnight Madness events from several Big Ten campuses on October 17, 2008, the Michigan Wolverines were not a featured part of the show. Michigan began the season with Ben Cronin suffering from a torn acetabular labrum (hip joint) and considering redshirting. The team started its season as the host of a 2K Sports College Hoops Coaches Vs. Cancer Classic tournament regional in which they defeated the and at Crisler Arena. Manny Harris won the second Big Ten Player of the week award of his career for his performances during these games.\nThe first two victories qualified Michigan to appear in the tournament final four at the Madison Square Garden where the unranked Wolverines team upset the #4 ranked UCLA Bruins men's basketball team for its first win over a top-five team in eleven years on November 20, 2008. The 55–52 win also ended a twelve-game losing streak against ranked opponents. During the game, Michigan forced 17 UCLA turnovers with its 1–3–1 zone defense. Nonetheless, Michigan fell behind by as many as 10 points at one point in the game. In the first half, the Wolverines shot 31.3% from the field, and in the second half, they shot 61.9%, including 4 of 8 on three-point shots. Michigan trailed by two with 4 minutes and 16 seconds left before Stu Douglass made a three-point basket and Sims scored a few possessions later after a steal. In the final seconds UCLA's Nikola Dragovic hit a 3-point shot with five seconds left to reduce Michigan's four-point lead to one. Then UCLA sent Harris to the line where he made two free throws. In the final seconds Michigan defended an attack by Darren Collison who had his final shot blocked by Harris. At that point in the season, Michigan used DeShawn Sims as a sixth man. He played 28 minutes off the bench and led the team in scoring with 18 while being tied for the lead with 5 rebounds. Despite losing to #10 ranked (#5 in the Coaches' Poll) Duke the following night, the Wolverines began receiving votes in the 2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings for the week of November 24.\nThe team earned a pair of non-conference victories against and Savannah State. In the Savannah St. game, Sims made a jump shot from the corner as time expired to win the game in overtime. Michigan had trailed by 20 at halftime, but scored the first 15 points of the second half. Next, the team was matched up against the Maryland in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, where they lost on December 3. The Maryland game marked Sims' entry into the starting lineup.\nOn December 6, 2008, Michigan posted its second consecutive win over a top 5 opponent in a rematch against Duke with an 81–73 victory. The game included 11 lead changes and 16 ties. The close contest allowed the fans to play a part as they forced Duke to use a time out to quiet the noisy crowd late in the second half. The game, which had an attendance of 13,751, marked Michigan's 168th sellout and eighth consecutive as host to Duke. Sims, in his new starting role, led the way with 28 points (a career-high) and 12 rebounds. Novak contributed 14 off the bench including 4 for 7 on three-point shots. Gerald Henderson fouled out in only 19 minutes of play. Michigan trailed 53–50 with 8 minutes and 38 seconds remaining before Novak hit three-point shots on consecutive possessions to give Michigan the lead for good. Michigan built a 68–59 lead with 3 minutes and 7 seconds left. Then, Duke made four straight three-point shots while Michigan made 13 of its last 14 free throws to defend its lead. The fourth three-pointer cut the lead to 75–71 with 51.3 seconds remaining. The game was the first time Michigan had defeated multiple top five teams in the same season since 1986–87 when it upended fifth-ranked Syracuse, 91–88 (January 18, 1987), second-ranked Iowa, 100–92 (January 31, 1987), and third-ranked Purdue, 104–68 (March 7, 1987). At that point in the season, Michigan's two wins against top five teams were as many as the rest of the nation combined.\nThen, after beating Eastern Michigan the following week, they welcomed Laval Lucas-Perry to the lineup as he contributed 14 points in 16 minutes of play in a victory over the Oakland Golden Grizzlies. Two days later on December 22, Michigan entered the Associated Press top 25 poll for the first time since February 6, 2006. Later that night in a victory over , DeShawn Sims became the first Wolverine to score 20 points and add 20 rebounds since Phil Hubbard had 22 points and 26 rebounds in a victory over University of Detroit in the 1977 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This performance earned him his second career Big Ten Player of the Week award. On December 29, the team entered the top 25 of the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.\nBig Ten season.\nAfter a win over , which gave the Wolverines ten wins to match its previous season's total, the team lost its Big Ten Conference opener against the Wisconsin Badgers on New Year's Eve. The win made Michigan the first ranked team that Wisconsin defeated during the season after three previous losses. During the game Zack Novak scored his season high 20 points, but Harris was held to 9 points and Wisconsin shot 58.7% from the field. On January 4, the team earned its first conference victory against the Illinois Fighting Illini when five player chipped in with double digit scoring efforts and the defense induced a low shooting percentage in the second half. The loss during the week caused Michigan to fall from the top 25 of both polls. Michigan rallied from a 20-point deficit against the Indiana Hoosiers to force overtime in which it prevailed on January 7. It was the team's first victory in Bloomington, Indiana since 1995. On January 11, defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes marking eight wins in nine games starting with the Duke upset. Michigan opened a 32–16 lead and was never challenged afterwards. Following the Indiana and Iowa victories, Michigan moved back into the top 25 in both polls (AP #25, ESPN/USAT #24).\nBeilein stayed at 499 career wins at four-year academic institutions, as Michigan suffered its first consecutive losses of the season when its second conference loss, which came against Illinois on January 14, was followed by a loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes on January 17. The Illinois contest was a rematch from ten days earlier. After a 31–30 Michigan halftime lead resulting from 11 lead changes, Illinois shut down Michigan early in the second half to build a 57–45 lead with 5 minutes remaining. In the game, Michigan did not attempt a free throw until the last 1 minute and 45 seconds of the second half. Against Ohio State, Michigan struggled against a 1–2–2 zone early in the game and fell behind by 11 before closing to a 29–25 halftime deficit. Michigan took a 44–40 lead with eight minutes remaining, and the score was tied at 47 before Ohio State ran off 10 points in a row. The game was a twentieth year celebration of the last Wolverine national championship with all but two members of the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament championship team in attendance as the team wore throwback uniforms. The consecutive losses caused the team to lose almost all of their support in the national rankings. On January 20, in a contest against Penn State that pitted the conferences two leading scorers (Harris and Talor Battle), Michigan shot 9 for 30 from the field in the first half including 2 for 16 on three-point shot attempts. They fell behind by as many as 23 points in the second half. The loss extended the losing streak to three games. Although Michigan rebounded with Beilein's 500th win in a January 24 victory over Northwestern in which they scored on their first five possessions and never looked back, they lost all support among the voters in the polls.\nMichigan ended January with a pair of losses to Ohio State and Purdue. The Ohio State game was notable for Novak's flagrant foul and ejection for elbowing P.J. Hill in the face. Harris accumulated a triple double of sorts with 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 turnovers. Against Purdue, Harris was held to single digit scoring for the third time in four games. During the game he was ejected for elbowing Purdue captain Chris Kramer in the nose, which spurred Purdue to a 40–20 run. Novak was ineligible due to an ejection in the prior game and Harris was ejected toward the beginning of the second half. On February 5, Harris was selected as a John R. Wooden Award 2008–09 Midseason Top 30 Candidate. After starting February play by snapping the two-game losing streak against Penn State on February 5, Michigan lost consecutive games to top ten opponents: Connecticut Huskies (#1) and Michigan State Spartans (#9). Harris posted a 28 points as Michigan rallied from a two-point halftime deficit to win by 20 against Penn State. Although Michigan confused Connecticut with a 2–3 zone defense instead of its normal 1–3–1 zone, which forced 10 first-half turnovers, Connecticut was victorious. The 11th double double of the season by Hasheem Thabeet helped Connecticut overcome only its second halftime deficit. Michigan stayed in the game in part due to six three-pointers by Stu Douglass. The loss against Michigan State marked 7 losses in 9 games for Michigan and gave Michigan State a 7–0 road record. On February 15, Michigan raised its record to 3–0 in overtime games in a victory over the Northwestern Wildcats on the road. Michigan took a 56–51 lead with 1 minute and 44 seconds left, but let it slip away. Michigan never trailed in the overtime. Then four days later, they posted their first consecutive win since a three-game streak from January 4 — 11 with a victory over the Minnesota Golden Gophers. In the game, Novak posted a career-best 6 three-pointers.\nMichigan suffered an 80–70 overtime loss at the hands of ten-place Big Ten foe, Iowa, on February 22. Michigan had led 56–52 with 1 minute and 13 seconds remaining in regulation before allowing four straight free throws by Matt Gatens. The game was notable because Harris did not play during the overtime. At the time of the benching, Harris was in a battle with fellow sophomores Talor Battle and Evan Turner for the Big Ten Scoring leadership. Beilein commented on the benching: \"That's what we had to do to make our team better now and in the future.\". In the subsequent game against #16-ranked Purdue, Michigan won 87–78, raising its record to 3–4 against ranked opponents on the season. Harris was one of Michigan's leaders with 27 points and 8 rebounds, while Sims had a career-high 29 points. On March 1, Michigan lost to Wisconsin 60–55. After taking a 34–32 halftime lead, Michigan opened the second half shooting 1 for 12. Michigan closed the contest to a 52–50 game with 3 minutes and 55 seconds remaining. They stayed close as Wisconsin missed four of eight late free throws. Prior to the final game of the season, the Wolverines adopted the slogan \"Queme los barcos,\" which means \"burn the ships\" and which had been used by 16th-century Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortez as a command to his troops to remind them that there was no turning back in their battle with the Aztec. The team traded in their traditional warmup jersey's for shirts with their adopted slogan. On March 7, they recovered from a 51–39 deficit to win their conference finale against Minnesota. Laval Lucas-Perry scored a career-high 19 points, including three straight three-pointers after Minnesota opened up the 12-point lead. Of the three teams that were ranked at the end of February and that Michigan had played twice (Duke, Illinois and Purdue), Michigan split the two games against each opponent, winning against each at home.\nPostseason.\nMichigan concluded its regular season with a 19–12 (9–9 Big Ten) record. This earned the team a tie for seventh place in the conference standings with Minnesota. Since Michigan swept the season series with a February 19, 74–62 win at home and a March 7, 67–64 win at Minnesota, Michigan was seeded seventh in the 2009 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament held at the Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana while Minnesota was seeded eighth. During Championship Week, the Wolverines defeated the number ten seeded Iowa Hawkeyes on March 12 by a 73–45 margin. Sims helped Michigan open a 22–9 lead by scoring 16 of his 27 points in the first 10 minutes. Then the team lost to the number two seeded Illinois Fighting Illini on March 13. Sims scored 15 and Harris was held to 9.\nMichigan continued to wear warmup shirts with the team slogan at the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the tournament, where Michigan earned the number 10 seed, the team defeated the Clemson Tigers 62–59 on March 19 in Kansas City. At one point, Michigan held a 16-point lead. After Harris gave Michigan a 58–43 lead with 5:51 remaining, Clemson had a 14–0 run to cut the deficit to 58–57 with 49 seconds left. Harris completed a three-point play on a driving layup with 37.4 second left. During the game, Clemson's top shooter Terrence Oglesby was ejected for a flagrant foul. The Wolverines lost in the second-round game played on March 21, 2009, to the 2-seeded Oklahoma in a 73–63. During the game four of Michigan's five starters who were trying to defend against Blake Griffin spent much of the game in foul trouble with Harris and Lee fouling out and Novak and Sims finishing with four fouls. Although Michigan tried a variety of defenders and various approaches such as doubling him, sagging in the lane, bumping him, Griffin still posted 33 points and 17 rebounds.\nAwards and honors.\nNo Wolverines were drafted into the 2009 NBA draft after the season. Before, during and after the season, individual players earned the following awards and honors:\nStatistical leadership.\nHarris led the Big Ten in free throw percentage according to some sources who recognize a 2.5 free throws made per game minimum, but was considered second according to the conference website that uses a 2 FTM/game minimum. The NCAA recognizes a 2.5 attempts per game minimum. Thus, according to the Big Ten Gatens is the Conference Free Throw Champion and according to the NCAA Harris is the champion. Harris and Sims were both ranked among the leaders in the Conference in several statistics and divided the team leadership in most statistics. Harris led the Wolverines in points, minutes, assists, free throws made, free throw percentage and steals, while Sims led the team in field goal percentage, rebounds and blocked shots. Although Harris led the team in scoring for the season, Sims led the team in scoring in all its victories against ranked teams during the regular season and during the last five games before the NCAA tournament, while the team was on the bubble.

A hard forward player Payne was described as 'tough-as-teak' and was still playing for veteran teams at the age of 84.\nRugby career.\nPayne was born in Llangyfelach and at the age of 14 had left school to join his father in the coal industry, tending the pit ponies. Payne initially had a trial for local soccer team Swansea A.F.C. but switched sports to rugby union playing for both Mynyddbach and Morriston before joining first class side Swansea in 1931. On 28 September 1935, Payne was chosen to play for the Swansea team to face the touring New Zealand team. When Swansea beat the All Blacks, they became the first club team to do so and also the first team to beat all three major Southern Hemisphere teams.\nLater in 1935, Payne was selected to face the same touring New Zealand team for Wales along with teammates Don Tarr, Haydn Tanner and Claude Davey. This was Payne's one and only cap for his country, but it was a memorable game for Wales as they won 13–12, with fourteen men for the last ten minutes after Tarr was stretchered off with a broken neck. Although being selected as a reserve player on several occasions, Payne never played for Wales again.\nDuring the 1938/39 season Payne was chosen to captain Swansea, but with the outbreak of war, Payne joined the Royal Marines. While in the marines he played rugby for both the marines and the Royal Navy and played in two wartime international for Wales against England. He saw action as a soldier in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, and was awarded six battle medals. On returning to Wales during peacetime he returned to working in the mines.\nHis later career included playing for veteran teams; and in 1989 at the age of 82, he turned out for a match against Bordeaux. His rugby career was finally halted after he broke his ankle while playing for Swansea Veterans RFC, in a match in the Netherlands in 1992.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "The Witchery of Archery, written by Maurice Thompson in 1878, was the first book in English about hunting with a bow ever published. Its full title is The Witchery of Archery: A Complete Manual of Archery. With Many Chapters of Adventures by Field and Flood, and an Appendix Containing Practical Directions for the Manufacture and Use of Archery Implements. It was the first important book about archery written in English since \"Toxophilus\", which was written in 1545. It was said that \"Witchery\" \"...has as much effect on archery as \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" had on the Civil War.\nBackground.\nWhen Thompson wrote \"The Witchery of Archery\", he filled it with various stories, many of which were humorous. However, it also gave practical advice on the sport, such as the manufacturing of archery paraphernalia and how to use the equipment while hunting.\n\"The Witchery of Archery\" was accredited for returning the sport of archery to public interest. Some of this was due to rifles bringing back bad memories of the American Civil War. However, the revival also served some larger, pragmatic purpose: ex-Confederate soldiers were not allowed guns, but needed hunting to survive; archery became a convenient substitution. In addition, the late 1800s saw the last of the American Indian Wars, thus romanticizing the Native Americans and their cultures, which, in most accounts, included expert archery. In 1880, with the book less than two years old, patents relating to archery items greatly increased. More than any other book, \"The Witchery of Archery\" led to the increased interest in archery for the next half-century.\nA year after \"The Witchery of Archery\" was published, Thompson was selected as the first president of the National Archery Association, largely due to the book.\nA writer of several books, Thompson seemed to show little pride in writing \"The Witchery of Archery\". On the title pages of his various works, he would list several titles he authored, but never did he list '\"\"The Witchery of Archery\"'."

The competition was held on Friday, August 12, 1932. Fifteen gymnasts from six nations competed. Each nation was limited to three gymnasts. The event was won by Romeo Neri of Italy, the nation's first victory in the men's parallel bars. István Pelle earned Hungary's first medal in the event with his silver, while Heikki Savolainen similarly earned Finland's first medal with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Eight of the 15 gymnast had competed in the Olympics before: Mario Lertora of Italy had finished fifth in 1924 and tied for seventh (with Mauri Nyberg-Noroma of Finland) in 1928. Along with those two seventh-place finishers, other returning gymnasts from 1924 were Romeo Neri of Italy, Heikki Savolainen of Finland, István Pelle and Miklós Péter of Hungary (the latter of whom had finished last in 1928), and Al Jochim and Frank Haubold of the United States. Pelle had won the 1931 world championships.\nJapan and Mexico each made their debut in the men's parallel bars. The United States made its fourth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nFor the second (after 1896) and last time, the parallel bars competition was entirely separate from the individual all-around rather than being entirely aggregated into the all-around or sharing qualification results. Each gymnast performed one compulsory exercise and one voluntary exercise. The score for each exercise was up to 30 points, with a combined score of 60 points maximum.\nResults.\nA separate competition was held, unrelated to the all-around event. Two exercises were contested with the results based on total points."

Lang would remain unselected for his country for another four years, but in 1931 he played for Llanelli when they hosted the touring South Africans. Lang ran out against the Springboks with his brother, Will, but ended the game on the losing side.\nIn 1934 Lang was back in the Welsh team, adding some experience to a team which the game earlier with 13 new caps, had lost at home to England. Led by Claude Davey and with the flair supplied by Cliff Jones, Wales beat Scotland at Murrayfield. This game was the first of ten sequential games that Lang would play for Wales stretching to 1937. His most memorable game during this period was Wales's win against the touring New Zealand team in 1935. Having already faced, and lost, to the All Blacks with Llanelli, Lang found himself selected to face the tourists for his country. It was a memorable win for Wales in a match filled with drama, that saw Wales losing with ten minutes remaining and their hooker stretchered off with a broken neck, only for the Welsh team to rally for a narrow win.

With the new manager, they picked themselves up and won five in a row, while the Germans themselves unexpectedly faltered: also drawing with Finland away from home, they also lost their home match with England by a resounding 5–1. Finland, in fact, might have been in with a chance of qualification themselves, but they lost a match to the unfancied Greece, whom England had to play in their final match, while Finland played Germany at the same time, with England and Germany guaranteed the top two places and separated only by goal difference.

Clement was in command of one of two companies of the Welch Regiment involved in the operation, but as they advanced down a 900-yard slope toward the objective, he and his men came under heavy fire and Clement was injured in his leg. They suffered high levels of casualties, one of Clement's platoons was all but wiped out, with just four survivors. Casualties with this platoon included one of just two other officers who had started the attack with Clement. He managed to rally his troops and engaged the enemy in close-quarter combat, killing at least 30. When ordered to withdraw, Clement remained until his wounded had been recovered, and only then returned to the rendezvous, where he finally agreed to receive medical treatment. For his actions in this encounter he was awarded the Military Cross on 21 December 1944. In 1945 he was wounded in action in the Netherlands, again while in charge of his company of the 4th Battalion.\nClement remained in the Territorial Army after the war, holding the rank of captain and honorary major. He was awarded the Territorial Efficiency Decoration for his long service on 29 April 1955, and finally left the army when he reached the age limit for service, on 9 April 1965.\nLater life.\nAfter the end of the war, Clement returned to Wales, becoming an accountant in Llanishen. He returned to rugby in 1955 when he was chosen from 83 applicants to take over the roll of Secretary of the WRU after Eric Evans became terminally ill. One of his first duties was to solve the problem of a home international against Scotland in 1956, when the pitch at the Cardiff Arms Park was entirely frozen. Clements arranged for a team of men to keep braziers burning on the pitch overnight in an identical solution to the same problem that affected the same pitch in 1893.\nHe was secretary throughout the Second Golden Age of Welsh rugby and along with treasurer Ken Harris is remembered for overseeing the rebuilding of the old Cardiff Arms Park. On his retirement in 1981 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to rugby."

        "text": "David Wagner (born March 4, 1974) is an American wheelchair tennis player. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down and with thirty percent function in his hands, he competes in the quad division. He plays by taping the tennis racket to his hand. He is currently ranked number three in the world in singles and number two in doubles.\nEarly life.\nWagner was born in Fullerton, California, and grew up in Walla Walla, Washington. He played basketball in high school and tennis in college. He became a quadriplegic at age 21 while visiting a friend in Redondo Beach, California, during summer break. He and his friends were playing frisbee on the beach and Wagner began chasing after the frisbee through shallow water. He attempted to jump over a wave, but the wave caught his feet, spun him around, and he landed head-first in the sand, leaving him paralyzed. He took a year off of college and began practicing table tennis as part of his rehabilitation. He won a national competition in that sport three years in a row, from 1997 to 1999.\nTennis career.\nIn 1999, at age 25, he attended a wheelchair tennis training camp set up by Rick Draney, then the top-ranked quadriplegic tennis player in the world. Wagner immediately loved the sport and by 2002 was the number one ranked U.S. quadriplegic player.\nIn 2002, Wagner reached number one in the ITF world rankings in quad doubles, and in 2003, he reached number one in the quad singles world rankings as well. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were the first Paralympic Games to include the quad division. Wagner won the gold medal in Quad Doubles with partner Nick Taylor and the silver medal in singles.\nIn 2007, he participated in the first Quad competition held at the U.S. Open, winning doubles with Taylor and taking second place in singles behind Peter Norfolk. Wagner had urged the United States Tennis Association to include a quadriplegic division at the event; the U.S. Open was the first of the Grand Slam tournaments to do so. The Australian Open followed suit the next year, with Wagner finishing runner-up in singles, and winning doubles with Taylor. The US Open and the Australian Open were the only Grand Slams to offer a Quad wheelchair tennis draw, until 2019. The first Quad Wheelchair Doubles exhibition event was held at Wimbledon in 2018. Wagner won the event, partnering Andy Lapthorne. Later that year, Wimbledon announced that they would offer a singles and doubles quad draw . Roland Garros followed with a similar announcement a few months later. Wagner, partnering Alcott, won the inaugural Roland Garros Quad Doubles draw.\nAt the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, Wagner and Taylor won gold in doubles and competed against each other in the bronze medal match of the singles event, with Wagner taking the match and the medal. At the 2012 London Paralympics, Wagner and Taylor won one more gold medal in doubles, defeating the British team of Andy Lapthorne and Peter Norfolk in the final. Wagner also won a silver medal in singles. At the final, he played against Israel's Noam Gershony. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics, Wagner clinched two more medals, a Silver in Quad Doubles and a Bronze in Quad Singles.\nAccording to ITF world rankings, Wagner had been consistently ranked in the top three of the quad division, in both singles and doubles, from 2002 until 2020. He has finished as Year-End Number 1 a total of eight times in singles, as well as fourteen times in doubles, . Wagner had been crowned doubles champion at every U.S. Open Quad Doubles draw, since the Grand Slam started offering a Quad Draw, in 2007, until 2019, when Wagner with partner Bryan Barten lost to Alcott and Lapthorne. He has also been crowned doubles champion in all editions of the French Open Quad Doubles draw so far, playing with three different partners.\nBesides competing, Wagner is often invited to teach in wheelchair camps and clinics in the United States, where he encourages both kids and adults to become involved with the sport.\nPersonal.\nWagner graduated with an elementary education degree in 2000. In 2001, when he had to choose between teaching and playing tennis, he decided to become a full time wheelchair tennis player. From 2006 until 2014 he lived in Hillsboro, Oregon, and then moved to Chula Vista, California. He trains at the Chula Vista Elite Athlete Training Center, (formerly Chula Vista Olympic Training Center) where he is the only tennis player in residence.\nTennis career statistics.\nGrand Slam performance timelines.\n\"Current through the 2023 Australian Open.\""

        "text": "Earl Rose (born 12 January 1984, in Strand, Cape Town) is a South African rugby union player who, although keen on fly-half, features primarily at fullback. He first came to prominence with the surprising inclusion in Springbok coach Peter de Villiers's 42-man training squad in 2008. He played for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup until 2009 and turned out for the Lions in the 2010 Super 14 season. In 2011 he was drafted into the Stormers team on tour in Australasia. Earl has since moved back to Strand where he helped his local club Sirlowrians gain promotion to the top tier of club rugby in the Western Cape. His excellent form was rewarded by His selection for Western Province sevens team in 2014.\nCareer overview.\nIn 1999, Rose was selected for the Western Province Under-Fifteen Merit Team, an accolade followed up two years later with his inclusion in the Under-Sixteen WP Academy. He played in Hoërskool Strand's First XV from 2000 to 2002, in which year he also made the WP Under-Eighteen Craven Week, the WP Under-Nineteen squad, the SA Schools team for matches against France and Wales, and the South African Under-Nineteen training squad. 2003 brought the IRB Sevens World Series in New Zealand and Brisbane, Australia, and the SA Under-Nineteen FIRA-AER World Championship. He was included in the Western Province Under-Twenty squad in 2004 and, three seasons later, the Lions Super 14 outfit. There followed De Villiers's training squad.\nHe was also selected as the only flyhalf for the Springbok tour of the UK in 2008, a move that has aroused further controversy, the South African Press Association describing it as a \"shock\". In retrospect, respected sports columnist Luke Alfred dubbed the decision \"short-sighted\", arguing that his place ought to have gone to Morné Steyn.\nA disappointing 2010 Super 14 campaign led to Rose being dropped by the Lions starting 15. He played in the Vodacom Cup during 2011 for the and once the competition concluded he was offered a short-term contract to play for the Stormers in Super Rugby.\nHowever, didn't extend his contract for the 2012 season and Rose joined the on a trial.\nPersonal life.\nRose was educated at Rusthof Primary School and Hoërskool Strand, and is currently 1.80 metres tall and 77 kilograms in weight. He told \"SA Sports Illustrated\", however, that he was looking to bulk up in a bid to stake his claim on the Lions' fly-half position.\nRose counts among his hobbies reading and listening to music, of which his favourite genre is R&amp;B. His all-time favourite player is Jason Robinson, but he also holds Chester Williams in lofty regard, having read his autobiography and been coached by him in the SA Sevens side. The one person whom he most admires, however, is his father Enver, who \"helped us [he and his brother Jody, who is also a professional rugby player] through many tough times. I was fairly young when we moved to the Lions. My parents were very supportive and encouraged us to believe in God and leave everything up to Him.\"\nIn January 2019 video footage emerged appearing to show Rose and a female counterpart colluding to steal golf clubs out of the bags of members of Stellenbosch Golf Club. The golf club confirmed that the incident was being investigated by police and would not rule out Rose, but could not comment while the investigation was pending, while it was also uncovered that Rose belonged to a group that sold second hand golf equipment online. The stolen clubs were returned, but charges were laid against Rose who handed himself over to the police and appeared in court on a charge of theft."

The race was won by the Italian rider Giovanni Valetti of the Fréjus team, with fellow Italians Ezio Cecchi and Severino Canavesi coming in second and third respectively.\nParticipants.\nOf the 94 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 7 May, 50 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 29 May. Riders were allowed to ride as a member of a team or group; 61 riders competed as part of a team, while the remaining 33 competed as a part of a group. The nine teams that partook in the race were: Bianchi, Dei, Fréjus, Ganna, Gloria-Ambrosiana, Lygie-Settebello, Legnano, Olympia, and Wolsit-Binda. The teams ranged from six to eight riders each. There were also seven groups, made up of three to five riders each, that participated in the race. Those groups were: U. C. Modenese, Il Littoriale, La Voce di Mantova, U.S. Azzini, U.S. Canelli, Dopolavoro Mater, and Gruppo A.\nThe peloton was composed primarily of Italian riders. The field featured one former Giro d'Italia winners with Francesco Camusso who won the race in 1931. Reigning champion Gino Bartali did not enter the race because the Italian government ordered him to race the Tour de France instead. Other notable Italian riders included Olimpio Bizzi, Giovanni Valetti, Ezio Cecchi, and Giuseppe Olmo. Swiss rider Leo Amberg who placed high at the 1936 and 1937 Tours de France competed in the race.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification. The group classification was decided in the same manner, but the classification was exclusive to the competing groups.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

It is located about southwest from the center of Kodaikanal in Tamil Nadu, South India at an elevation of . \nThe club is on Golf links Road near the popular view point 'Suicide Point' (\"Green Valley View\") and before the 'Pillar Rocks' viewpoint and flower garden.\nThis club is notable for its age and the wildlife frequently seen on the course. The club logo is two crossed golf clubs behind an indian tiger on a round yellow field, framed with \"Kodaikanal Golf Club * Play the Game\" imprinted in white on a dark green border.\nHistory.\nThe club was established on 17 June 1895 by twelve British golfers. They were also the architects of the course. In the early years, members were British and American civil servants and missionaries. During the fifties it became a club tradition for the annual Captaincy to rotate between an Indian, an American and a Commonwealth citizen. This tradition continued until the late 70's, when the local expatriate population diminished. Originally there were only 9 holes and the putting surfaces were browns. In the early fifties the course was extended to 18 holes. In 1986 the putting surfaces were relaid with greens.\nThe clubhouse, named the Centenary Building, was renovated in 1995.\nFacilities.\nThe Kodaikanal Golf club is a private membership club with over 600 members.\nThe club has a range of facilities available for the recreation, entertainment and comfort of its guests. The main facility is the 18 hole golf course described below. There is a practice net for driving practice and a designated putting practice area.\nInside the clubhouse, for group activities there is a 12-seat conference room, a card games room, a billiards Room, a members lounge with fireplace, a BYOB bar and a dining hall. For members visiting from a distance, there is lodging available, including 2 super deluxe rooms, 2 deluxe rooms and 2 standard rooms.\nGolf Course.\nNon-members are allowed to play the full 18 holes by becoming temporary members or by paying the required green fees.

Total length of the course is Some holes have interesting alternative names, depending on the challenges they offer to golfers. The 4th hole is also called the \"Devil's Dip\", as the fairway from the tee-box to the green is a solid dip, which runs on as far as the eye can see. The 6th hole is named \"Tiger Hole\" because Tigers used to be sighted near it. The 12th hole is called the \"Cardiac Hole\", due to the strenuousness of the walk. A \"hard hitters\" course, the 13th \"Twister\" green is not visible from the tee box. The 15th hole (\"New Long'un\") which has the longest yardage of , needs two long shots to sight the green.\nIt takes about 3 hours to play the entire course.\nTournaments.\nIn 2008 fifty-six tournaments were conducted daily between mid-April and early June. Palani Hill Open, Veday Cup, Rudrappan Memorial Cup, Contessa Open and A V Thomas Tournament (introduced recently), are some of the major tournaments. The 2008 Addicts Golfing Society of Southern India 3 day Kodaikanal meet had 108 entries and 5 competitions.

        "text": "The Indigenous Australian rugby league team (also known as the Indigenous All Stars or Indigenous Dreamtime team) is a rugby league football team that represents Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The team was first formed in 1973 and currently plays in an annual All Stars Match against a National Rugby League NRL All Stars team.\nHistory.\nAn Aboriginal v White Australian rugby league game was held in Barcaldine in Western Queensland in 1963. These 'Blacks v Whites' games continued annually until 1984.\nThe first Australian Aboriginal rugby league team was assembled in 1973 The Aboriginal team managed to win seven of its nine matches in just 10 days, The team consisted of 34 players – 19 from NSW, 13 from Queensland and two from the Northern Territory. They went on to win games against Kiwi premiers Wellington Petone, the only all-Māori team &amp; Auckland club &amp; Te Atatu, which the Aboriginal side won 17–13.\nThe side competed in the Pacific Cup in 1990, 1992 and 1994. During this period the team contained New South Wales Rugby League first grade players such as Ricky Walford, Graham Lyons, Ron Gibbs, Darrell Trindall, Paul Davis, Wayne Alberts, George Longbottom and Will Robinson.\nIn the post-1999 NRL season an Aboriginal side managed by Arthur Beetson defeated the Papua New Guinea Kumuls and the future rugby league Immortal was pushing for an Australia Day match against the Australian national team.\nOn the same day as the All Stars announcement, the league also revealed the NRL Pre-Season Challenge would return in 2024, with the tournament kicking off on February 15 and running across two weekends.\nIn 2008 World Cup curtain raiser to the Australia vs. New Zealand match included an Indigenous Australian squad playing against New Zealand Māori which featured several prominent NRL players and rising stars, including Chris Sandow, Wairangi Koopu, Preston Campbell, Shaun Kenny-Dowall and Carl Webb.\nPreston Campbell, a highly respected Aboriginal rugby league player, was a driving force behind the setup, in 2010, of a curtain raising match between the Indigenous All Stars, and the NRL All Stars. The Indigenous All Stars played what seems likely become an annual match against the National Rugby League All Stars on 13 February 2010. The squad was chosen in part by public vote. Aboriginal NRL player Sid Domic's artistic ability led him to be selected from a field of six artists to design the Indigenous side's jersey, as well as Johnathan Thurston's and Jamie Soward's custom headgear, for the annual All Stars matches.\n2019 will see a new format of the Australian Indigenous All-Stars play the New Zealand Māori at AAMI Park in Melbourne on 15 February. It will be part of an All-Stars double header with the women's teams to play the curtain-raiser Māori and indigenous teams to the men's game. With no All-Stars game in 2017 due to the World Cup, the NRL will be hoping the inclusion of the New Zealand Māori side will spark popularity in the fixture. With three Indigenous players also eligible for both teams Dane Gagai, Reimis Smith, Josh Hoffman and Javid Bowen.\nTeams.\nFirst Australian Aboriginal Rugby League Team 1973 Tour.\nSource:\n2014 Festival of Indigenous Rugby League.\nThe NRL launched a Festival of Indigenous Rugby League program to take the place of the prestigious pre-season Rugby League All Stars game following every World Cup year. The 2014 Festival of Indigenous Rugby League featured a trial match between the Knights and a non-elite Indigenous team, drawn from the immensely popular NSW Koori Rugby League Knockout and Murri Carnivals in Queensland, as well as the NRL Indigenous Player Cultural Camp, Murri vs Koori women's and Under 16s representative games, a Murri v Koori match, a jobs expo and community visits."

Hayes spent three years playing junior hockey for Oshawa 1965-68. He left hockey for two years, but returned in the 1970-71 season to play for Loyola College in Montreal. He then turned pro playing in four pro leagues for five different teams in a four-year span.\nWhile playing for the Oklahoma City Blazers of the Central Hockey League in 1972, Hayes was called up due to injuries to play for the Boston Bruins. He played one game in the 1972 playoffs: Game #3 of Boston's semifinal series in St. Louis versus the Blues. Boston won 7-2. Hayes recorded no points and no penalty minutes, but he did serve a Boston bench penalty for too many men on the ice. Hayes never played in the NHL again. Although Hayes was entitled to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup for having appeared in a playoff game, it was not. Hayes was not re-signed by the Boston organization after the end of the 1973-74 season, and played four games in the NAHL in 1975-76, his final professional action. In April 2018, Chris Hayes finally received his Stanley Cup ring after Boston's team president Cam Neely learned about Hayes' situation."

The present site was chosen due to its relation to the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway's interurban railroad line with frequent passenger service to the site because automobiles and roads were few.\nThe PGA Championship, then a match play competition, was held at the club in 1946. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as the Portland Golf Club Clubhouse and Golf Course, in 2023.\nTournaments hosted.\nMajor championships for all tours are shown in bold."

        "text": "The 1973 Singapore Grand Prix was a motor race held at the Thomson Road Grand Prix circuit on 22 April 1973. It was the final Singapore Grand Prix before the cancellation of the event, which resumed in 2008 as a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race was contested over 50 laps and was won by Vern Schuppan driving a March. The race was run to Australian Formula Two rules.\nReport.\nBackground.\nJohn MacDonald had a brand new Brabham BT40 delivered to him for the race. However, his team ran into difficulty due to fuel pick-up problems with the new car.\nIn the 1972 event, the 28-year-old Singaporean driver Lionel Chan was involved in an accident which saw his car roll into a ditch on the fourth lap after losing a wheel and hitting an official car. He was taken to hospital but fell into a coma and later died. The circuit was considered dangerous and the Singaporean Minister of Social Affairs, Encik Othman Wok, stated, \"I'll be the happiest man when we get a permanent circuit.\"\nRace.\nSchuppan was leading Malcolm Ramsay's Birrana when Schuppan's March kicked up some stones, puncturing Ramsay's fuel tank and covering him in petrol.\nAftermath.\nDuring a support race for touring cars, Swiss driver Joe Huber went off the track into a lamp post. He died six days later as a result of his injuries. The difficulty of implementing adequate safety measures, along with concerns that the Grand Prix was promoting reckless driving, led to motor racing being banned in Singapore after the 1973 Grand Prix. Other contributory factors have been suggested, including an increase in traffic, the inconvenience of having to close roads for the event and also a surge of oil prices stemming from the Suez Crisis. On average the Grand Prix saw one fatality per year, partly due to the nature of the circuit which featured monsoon drains and bus stops. Graeme Lawrence, a three-time winner of the Singapore Grand Prix, believed that the Thomson Road circuit was one of the most dangerous in the world.\nA permanent track incorporating a sports complex was proposed as a replacement for the Thomson Road circuit, but this did not come to fruition."

        "text": "Thomas Smyth (1 December 1884 – 19 May 1928) was an Irish international, rugby union prop forward who played club rugby for Newport and Malone and invitational rugby with the Barbarians. He won fourteen caps for Ireland and was selected to captain the British Isles 1910 tour of South Africa, and played in two of the test games.\nRugby career.\nSmyth first played for Ireland in 1908, in the Home Nations Championship against England at Richmond's Athletic Ground. Although Ireland lost the match 13-3 Smyth was back for the next game of the tournament against Scotland. With the match played at Lansdowne Road, the Irish beat the Scottish team in a game which was notable as the last game for Scotland's David Bedell-Sivright, the British Isle's captain of the 1904 campaign to Australia and New Zealand. Smyth played out the 1909 and 1910 Championships and scored his first international try in the 1910 game against France. Smyth's next and last score for his country was in a 3–0 win at Lansdowne road versus England, when the Harlequin centre Frank Stoop's poor clearing kick led to Smyth scoring the only points of the game when he took the ball over the line for a try."

        "title": "Three Skeleton Key",
        "text": "\"Three Skeleton Key\" is a short story by the French author Georges-Gustave Toudouze. The January 1937 edition of \"Esquire\" marked its first appearance in English. This suspenseful tale and \"Leiningen Versus the Ants\" were discovered by the magazine's editor Arnold Gingrich. \nGeorges-G. Toudouze (1877–1972) was born in Paris, France. His father, Gustave Toudouze, was a well-known author of the time. The younger Toudouze wrote on such topics as art, architecture, travel and French naval history. Although he penned numerous adventure novels and short stories, he is today remembered for a single work: \"Three Skeleton Key\".\nPlot.\nThe plot involves three men tending a lighthouse on an island off the coast of French Guiana. The rock the lighthouse stands on is dubbed 'Three Skeleton Key', named after a tragedy when three convicts escaping from Cayenne became ship-wrecked on the rock and eventually died of hunger and thirst – the only thing left of them were a heap of bones cleaned off by scavenging birds. The three lighthouse attendants are headkeeper, Itchoua (the eldest of the men), Le Gleo, and the narrator (whose name is never given).\nAn abandoned ship, infested with ferocious rats, makes landfall. A life-and-death struggle ensues as the men seek to save themselves from the hungry horde, who swarm over the lighthouse. The three men barely survive fending off the rats when they break into the tower. The men escape into the lighthouse gallery, which has a metal trapdoor that the rats cannot gnaw through, and are able to use the light to signal an investigating patrol boat. Eventually the rats are lured off the island onto a barge loaded with meat, which is then set on fire by incendiary shells. Many of the rats die and the survivors are devoured by the sharks that infest the waters. The fates of the men are then revealed by the narrator: Le Gleo went insane from the events and was locked away in a French asylum, and Itchoua dies of infection from rat bites and scratches. The narrator continues to work in the lighthouse until his service time is over.\nPublishing history.\nThis work first appeared in French in 1927 as \"La tour d'épouvante\", and was featured in Toudouze's 1946 short story collection \"Aux Feux tournants des Phares...: Récits de Mer et de Haute Mer\" with illustrations by P. Peron.\nThe first English edition of \"Three Skeleton Key\" was in 1937 in \"Esquire\".\nAdaptations.\nJames Poe adapted the story for radio in a version that aired on \"Escape\" on November 15, 1949. Poe's script gave different names to the three characters: the narrator is named \"Jean\", the head keeper Itchoua is named \"Louis\" and Le Gleo is now a hunchbacked former actor named \"Auguste\"; the adaptation also provides a different and more chilling reason as to why the rats eventually leave the lighthouse.\nThe One Act Audio Theatre revisited \"Three Skeleton Key\" in 2001. A modern recording of the piece can be found at the organization's web site as well as the script by James Poe.\nExternal links.\nStreaming audio\nShort Film"

He won six caps for Wales and also played for the British Isles in their 1910 tour of South Africa.\nRugby career.\nWaller joined Newport in 1906 and represented the club on 79 appearances. While playing in Britain he represented two county teams, Somerset and Monmouthshire. In 1908 Waller turned out for Newport against the touring Australian team. He debuted for Wales against the same touring Australian team he faced with Newport. The next year he was selected to play in all three matches of the 1909 Home Nations Championship. In his first Home Nations match against England he was joined by fellow Newport player Jack Jones and Swansea's Jack Bancroft. Wales won all their matches and won the Triple Crown. Wales and Waller also faced France during 1909, and after beating them Wales won the unofficial Grand Slam. Waller is therefore one of the very few Welsh internationals to have defeated a Southern Hemisphere team and won a Grand Slam in the same season. Waller played once more for Wales, again against France in a record breaking game in 1910.\nWaller was chosen in 1910 to represent the British Isles team in their tour of South Africa. Waller was chosen to play in all three tests, and after the tournament was over, elected to stay in South Africa and played for Johannesburg's Golden Lions. After the outbreak of World War I, he enlisted in the South Africa Artillery Regiment. He was killed by shellfire at Arras in northern France in 1917.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nBritish Isles"

        "text": "The 2002 NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament began on December 5, 2002 with 64 teams and concluded on December 21 when Southern California defeated Stanford 3 games to 1 in New Orleans, Louisiana for the program's second NCAA title and fifth overall national title.\nIt was Southern California's first national title since 1981, while Stanford was the defending 2001 national champion. Semifinalist Hawaii was making the program's seventh NCAA final four appearance, while Florida made the program's first final four appearance in four years.\nRecords.\nThe conference champion from each of 31 conferences earned a bid to the 2002 NCAA Volleyball Tournament, along with 33 at-large bids. The Big Ten and Pac-10 led all conferences with eight bids each. In all, ten conferences had a team ranked in the top 16 of the tournament. As of 2017, this is the most conferences represented by seeded teams in a single tournament in the 64-team era (since 1998).\nNational Semifinals.\nSouthern California vs. Florida.\nWhen Florida took the first set, it was the first time in 6 NCAA Semifinal appearances that a Florida team was able to win a single set. However, the rest didn't go their way as USC won the next three to advance to the national championship. In the deciding fourth set, USC took the 16-8 lead before Florida came back to cut the lead to 19-17, but the Gators were unable to take the lead before USC won the fourth set, 30-24 and the match.\nStanford vs. Hawaii.\nStanford got a chance to defend their 2001 NCAA title after dismantling Hawaii, 3-0. The 3-0 loss was only Hawaii's second loss of the season, with their other loss coming to Stanford in a 3-0 sweep in the preseason. Ogonna Nnamani led Stanford with 15 kills, while Hawaii was led by Kim Willoughby who had 22 kills.\nNational Championship: Southern California vs. Stanford.\nUSC dethroned defending NCAA national champion Stanford in a 3-1 match to finish the season 31-1, with their only loss coming to Stanford. In set one, USC had 22 kills while Stanford had just 8, leading them to a 30-27 victory. In set two, Stanford came back to take 9 of the first 12 points en route to the easy 30-23.\nUSC sprinted to the 19-10 lead in set 3, before the Cardinal cut the advantage at 20-17. USC's offense proved to be too much, as they won it 30-24. In set 4, USC cruised out to an early 6-1 lead and then 17-11. The lead soon disappeared, with Stanford tying it up at 19, before USC pulled away again to win the fourth set 30-26 and take home the national title. It was USC's first national championship since 1981, the first year that NCAA started to sponsor women's volleyball."

        "text": "Svenskt Respitsystem (SRS), formerly known as Leading Yard Stick and Lidingö Yard Stick (LYS). SRS is a semi-empirically based handicapping system used in yacht racing in the Nordic countries. The first version of the handicap system was developed in 1970 by the Swedish yacht designer Lars-Olof Norlin. He based the system on regatta results from the Round Lidingö Race. His own design, Allegro 27, was used as the benchmark and was by definition assigned a LYS value of 1.00.\nEvery yacht model has a SRS number that was previously based on results in regattas or, for new models, based on a velocity prediction program (VPP) as in IMS and some other handicapping systems. The SRS number is multiplied by the measured time in order to get the handicap corrected time. Thus, a yacht with SRS 1.30 needs to sail at least 30% faster than a yacht with SRS 1.00 to win over it. Trimarans of the type open OMRA 60, designed for racing only, have SRS values above 3.0. \nThe system was revised in 2011 and onwards, and is now primarily based on a secret calculation formula that should reflect the performance of each yacht. The formula is secret to prevent development of designs that are optimised for SRS racing.\nAs the system is semi-empirically based the SRS number for each individual model might be subject for evaluation and eventually change. This particularly applies to new models based on VPP. The system enables yachts of all sizes and types to compete with each other. SRS 1.00 would equal an average boatspeed of 5.5 knots on a circular course at a wind speed of 5.0 m/s.\nSRS numbers.\nThe numbers are agreed on by an internordic group. The group is responsible for maintaining a standard list, and agree on SRS values for models that are not yet on the list. If there are sufficient numbers of a specific model, the model will become a standard model.\nThe standard list is under constant review and change, and an updated list can be found at norlys.org."

        "text": "Frank L Williams (26 January 1910 – 7 July 1959) was a Welsh international rugby union centre for Wales who played club rugby for Cardiff, Wakefield and Headingley. Williams was a solid defensive player, who not only tackled well but was also unafraid to cover a grounded ball and accepted the punishment meted out.\nRugby career.\nWilliams was first selected for Wales on 2 February 1929 in a game against Scotland at St Helens. Wales won 14-7, ending a run of four consecutive home defeats by Scotland. Williams was reselected in Wales's next two games, a victory over France and a trip to Ireland for the final game of the 1929 Championship. Williams was among the majority of the Welsh players to wake up feeling ill on the morning of the Ireland game, with only tee-totalers Morley and Peacock unaffected. Ireland took an early lead in a brutal, defensive encounter. Williams managed to break through the Irish defence to score his first international try, which Dai Parker converted to give Wales a draw.\nIn 1929 Williams was appointed as the sports master of Wakefield Grammar School in Yorkshire, and played the rest of his club career in Yorkshire, playing club rugby for Wakefield and Headingley and county rugby for the Yorkshire XV. Williams continued to represent Wales, turning out for all four matches in the 1930 Five Nations Championship, in which Wales finished second, losing to Scotland and England and beating Ireland and France. In the same year Williams was offered a position in the 1930 British Lions tour, but turned down the invitation.\nWilliams was back in the Wales squad for the 1931 Championship, though he missed the first two games against England and Scotland. In the match against France he linked up with Claude Davey and Dicky Ralph to form a strong midfield triangle which overran the French. Wales scored seven tries, with Williams scoring his second try for his country. In the final match of the tournament Wales beat Ireland 15-3 and won the Five Nations Championship.\nAt the end of the 1930/31 season, Williams was chosen to tour south Wales with the Barbarians. It was a very successful set of matches for the invitational Baa-Baas, winning all their matches in south Wales for the first time. At the end of 1931, the touring South Africans arrived in Britain and Williams faced them twice. Williams was on the losing side twice, firstly for Wales in December, and then as part of a joint Yorkshire/Cumberland team in January the next year.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

The race began on 10 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Genoa, finishing back in Milan on 1 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Italian rider Giuseppe Enrici. Second and third respectively were the Italian riders Federico Gay and Angiolo Gabrielli.\nThe 'start list' was reduced because of a strike, so the organiser Gazzetta dello Sport allowed independent riders to enter without support teams, as they provided bed, board and massage. The event was unique because of the participation of Alfonsina Strada, the only female competitor in the history of the Giro. Entry number 72 was granted to \"Alfonsin Strada\" to conceal her gender. She successfully completed the first 7 stages but a series of crashes and punctures between L'Aquila and Perugia led to her exclusion (such was her heroism that the organisers allowed her to continue each stage without inclusion in the overall classification). Her final time was 20 hours behind of the first classified in Milan.\nParticipants.\nThe peloton was completely composed of Italians for the second consecutive year. Notable riders that started the race included Giuseppe Enrici, Federico Gay and Bartolomeo Aymo. Former winners Costante Girardengo and Giovanni Brunero, along with Ottavio Bottecchia, Gaetano Belloni, and other top riders chose not participate in the race due to disagreements over appearance fees with the organizers. In order to get the appropriate number of riders, the organizers offered room and board, along with food, for all those who entered. The riders were all considered to be independent as many riders were in disagreement with their teams over money. Of the 90 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 10 May, 30 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 1 June.\nThe 1924 edition of the race saw the first and only ever woman participate. Alfonsina Strada entered the race as \"Alfonsin Strada\" to conceal her gender. She previously raced against men in the Giro di Lombardia in 1917 and 1918. She was widely regarded as the best female cyclist in Italy at the time. Her identity was uncovered and made public by \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" on 14 May when they published the headline \"Alfonsina e la bici.\" Strada completed the first seven stages, but finished outside the time limit on the eighth stage where she fell several times and arrived in Perugia fifteen hours after starting. The organizers, however, asked her to continue riding to the race's finish because of the heightened interest in the race due to a woman participating in a men's event.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were 30 cyclists who had completed all twelve stages. For these cyclists, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the winner. Angiolo Gabrielli won the prize for best ranked independent rider in the general classification.\nAftermath.\nEnrici became the first foreign born winner of the Giro d'Italia. Although he maintained Italian citizenship, Enrici was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States."

Day !! Date !! Start !! Finish !! Event !! Phase\nPractice.\nGermany's André Lange had the fastest time in two-man practice on the night of 17 February 2010. There were eight crashes among 57 runs taken that night. Three crashes occurred during the 18 February 2010 two-man training session. Among the crashes in the two-man event were Switzerland's Beat Hefti and Daniel Schmid who both withdrew from the two man event. Meanwhile, Latvia's Janis Minins withdrew to appendicitis and the emergency surgery that followed on 12 February. Minins returned to competition for the four-man event eleven days later.\nSupplemental training was offered on 19 February 2010 to both the two-woman and four-man bobsleigh events out of caution and further preparation for both events that would take place the following week. American bobsledder Shona Rohbock expressed concerns on the 19th that the track could generate speeds that are too dangerous for racing. She stated that she had never experienced speeds at even bobsleigh track she had experienced, event at the St. Moritz track. Officials had told Rohbock that they are considering sanding the runners to slow down the sleds to slow down the speeds. Elana Meyers, an American brakewoman, commented on Twitter that same day that \"We (referring to her and her driver Erin Pac) went .. that's fast!\" One crash occurred on the 19th for the two-woman event when Dutch bobsledder Esme Kamphuis crashed out in the final corners of the track.\nMinor changes were made to the track on 22 February 2010 after bobsleigh four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary training. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, training runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 so it would be easier for sleds to get through the rest of the track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone stated that \"...some drivers have been experiencing difficulties transitioning from turn 11 to turn 12.\" As a result, Krone stated that \"The FIBT track commission, in conjunction with VANOC and with advice from a number of team captains, are working on the shape of turn 11 to make it easier for drivers to get high enough on 11 to turn 12 so that they can successfully make it through turn 13.\" Krone also stated that it was common that the profile of corners were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines (luge and skeleton).\nAfter track alterations were done on 23 February 2010, the two fastest four-man times were done by Germany's Lange and the United States' Holcomb. Australia withdrew its four-man team on 23 February 2010 to two of its crew members, Duncan Harvey and Duncan Pugh, suffering concussions. Australia chef de mission Ian Chesterman stated that the decision was not taken lightly and was done on the side of safety. Meanwhile, Latvia's Janis Minins returned to practice on the 23rd in the wake of the emergency surgery on 12 February in the wake of an appendicitis attack.\nLange had the fastest practice times on the 24th with the final two practices taking place on the 25th. That same day, Australia withdrew to injuries to Harvey and Pugh of Australia while Edwin van Calker of the Netherlands withdrew to a lack of confidence of driving the four-man sled during the event. This was also despite no crashes during four-man training had taken place prior to the 24th. The Dutch team supported van Calker's decision on this. Minins withdrew from the four-man event on the 25th to crashing twice during practice where one of his crews suffering a concussion and another suffering bruised lungs and elbows.\nQualifying.\nAthlete/NOC quota.\n170 athletes are allowed to compete in accordance with the International Olympic Committee and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT).

The events were held between 15 and 28 February 2010.\nCompetition schedule.\n! Day !! Date !! Start !! Finish !! Event\nQualification.\nAcross the twelve cross-country skiing events, a maximum of 310 athletes are allowed to compete. No nation can have more than 20 skiers competing, with an additional limit of 12 men or 12 women per specific nation. For each event, a nation can enter four skiers in individual events and one team in relay races.\n\"A\" Competitors with less than 100 distance FIS points will be allowed to compete in any event. Competitors with less than 120 sprint FIS points will be allowed to compete in sprint events only.\n\"B\" Countries that do not have a skier that meets the \"A\" Qualification standard have the right to enter one male and one female skier in either the sprint or the 10 km (women)/ 15 km (men) on condition that the skiers competed at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 and have a maximum of 300 FIS points in the event concerned.\nA basic quota of one man and one woman was assigned to all nations competing. Each nation with a skier in the top 300 of the distance or sprint FIS points lists was allocated one additional quota place. For top 30 in the 2009-10 Cross-Country Skiing World Cup extra quota places were allocated separately for both genders, nations with two or more skiers in the top 30 earning two more skiers and nations with one skier in the top 30 earning one extra place. The remaining quotas were allocated to countries based on the FIS point allocation list. Once a nation reached the maximum of 20 slots it became ineligible to earn any more slots. Quota places not used up by the National Olympic Committees were returned to the pool and reallocated. This process started on 18 January 2006 and ran until 28 January 2010.\nParticipating nations.\n55 countries participated in the 2010 edition."

The events took place between 14 and 27 February 2010.\nShen Xue and Zhao Hongbo (CHN) won the gold medal in the pairs skating. This was the first time since 1960 that a Russian, Soviet, or Unified Team (CIS) flagged team did not win the gold medal.\nQualification.\nSkater eligibility.\nTo be eligible for the 2010 Winter Games, skaters needed to be older than fifteen as of July 1, 2009 and had to be a citizen of the country they were representing. Unlike qualification rules for International Skating Union events, in the case of a pair or ice dance couple, both skaters were required to be citizens of the country they represented in competition. In addition, International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules required that at least three years had passed since the competitor(s) last represented another country in competition.\nSkater qualification.\nThere was no individual athlete qualification to the Olympics; the choice of which athlete(s) to send to the Games was left to the discretion of each country's National Olympic Committee (NOC).\nCountry qualification.\nThe number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games was limited by a quota set by the IOC. There were 30 skaters in the disciplines of ladies' and men's singles, 20 pairs, and 24 ice dance couples.\nCountries could qualify entries to the 2010 Winter Olympics in two different ways. The host country was guaranteed one spot in each event, if it had not already qualified an entry in that event. Every discipline qualified separately.\nThe majority of the country qualification took place at the 2009 World Figure Skating Championships, where countries qualified up to three entries in each discipline. The number of multiple entries was the same as usual for the World Championships; countries who earned multiple spots to the Olympics also earned multiple spots to the 2010 World Figure Skating Championships.\nThe multiple spots qualification to the Olympics from the World Championships was as follows:\nThe placement score did not directly correlate to the placement rank. In ice dance, if a couple did not qualify for the original dance from the compulsories, they were assigned 20 points. If an ice dance couple did not qualify for the free dance, or if a singles skater or pairs team did not qualify for the free skate, they were assigned 18 points. If a skater or team competed in the free skate or free dance and placed lower than 16, they were assigned 16 points. For those placing above 16th, the placement rank was the same as the placement score.\nThe results of the 2009 World Championships determined 83 total spots: 24 entries in each singles discipline, 16 in pairs, and 19 in ice dance. The available spots were awarded consecutively on moving down the results list, with the multiple spots being awarded first.\nThe remainder of the spots were filled at the 2009 Nebelhorn Trophy, held in the fall of 2009. Countries who had already earned an entry to the Olympics were not allowed to qualify more entries at this final qualifying competition.\nIf a country declined to use one or more of its spots, the vacated spot was awarded based on the results of the Nebelhorn Trophy.\nCompetition schedule.\nAll times are Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8).\nRecords and firsts.\nThe following new ISU best scores were set during this competition:\nOther records and firsts:\nParticipating NOCs.\nThirty-one nations contributed figure skaters to the events at Vancouver."

Moore was a player in the Negro leagues, appearing with several different teams including his hometown Atlanta Black Crackers. He also served with three different All-Star teams and, in 1938, played with the Southern News Services All-American Negro League Baseball Team. In 2006, he was inducted into the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame. Listed at and , he batted and threw left-handed.\nBiography.\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, Moore began playing baseball professionally after graduating from Booker T. Washington High School in 1933. Over the next six years, Moore moved among the Atlanta Black Crackers, Macon Peaches, Chattanooga Choo-Choos, Schenectady Black Sox, Newark Eagles and Baltimore Elite Giants. He gradually earned a reputation, according to \"Voices from the Negro Leagues\", as perhaps \"\"the\" best fielding basemen of all time\" in his league. Baseball records for his time playing with major Negro league teams (1937–1940) list Moore as accruing a .279 batting average with two home runs and 96 runs batted in. His best offensive season was 1938, when he batted a combined .355 with Atlanta and Newark.\nIn 1940, after finishing the regular season in Baltimore, Moore played in a winter season in Los Angeles that allowed white and black players to compete against each other, a competition that was first allowed and then halted by Major League Baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Moore himself believed that the games were halted because the black players were too successful, stating that \"The public, they liked to see the competition, but the commissioner, he didn't have that attitude after he found out that we were drawin' real good crowds and we were beatin' 'em a lot.\"\nMoore registered for the military draft in October 1940, and served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1945. After the war, he returned to baseball for three seasons with the minor Negro league Atlanta Black Crackers. At his most highly paid, prior to the war, he earned $250 a month with a $1.50 daily food allowance.\nIn 2006, Moore was among six individuals inducted into the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame, in its second year of existence. He died at the age of 99 on February 6, 2016; he was survived by his wife, Mary.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

Soon after completing the course, these founders sold the course to the Dorset Carter family. It is believed that Dorset Carter purchased the club in 1921 for his son, Keefe Carter. Keefe was an accomplished golfer, winning the prestigious Western Open in 1925.\nThe official founding date of Twin Hills came in 1923. This date coincides with the date the clubhouse was completed, and the Club was officially incorporated as member-owned in 1946. Twin Hills has hosted several prestigious tournaments over the years including the Western Amateur, PGA Championship, Western Junior Open, Oklahoma City Open, U.S. Junior Amateur, NAIA National Championship and has hosted some of the world’s greatest golfers—Johnny Revolta, Arnold Palmer, Gene Sarazen, Gene Littler, and many more."

        "text": "The Shawnee Inn &amp; Golf Resort is a resort in the village of Shawnee on Delaware, located in the foothills of the Pocono Mountains in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The hotel is a Spanish colonial revival building with white-Moorish architecture and Spanish tiled roofs. Mike Jesky of the \"Standard-Speaker\" wrote, “The three-story, 96-room inn looms large and flat on the grounds, with a stately yet inviting appearance.” In the 1990s the Shawnee Inn was identified as the only resort on the banks of the Delaware River. \"Tee Time\" magazine has ranked the golf course there as one of the finest in the Mid-Atlantic region.\nHistory.\nThe hotel opened on June 5, 1911, as the Buckwood Inn and was built by Charles Campbell Worthington, formerly head of the Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation. It was constructed out of concrete, considered unusual for the time, and some of the walls were a foot thick. Author Lawrence Squeri wrote, “Although the Buckwood Inn was adjacent to the Delaware River, only a few steps from the water, its management realized that guests preferred a swimming pool to river bathing.”\nThe golf course at the Buckwood Inn was the first to be designed by A. W. Tillinghast, a renowned golf course architect. In 1919 the resort was a host site for a U.S. Women's Amateur won by Alexa Stirling. John D. Rockefeller stopped over to play golf at the Buckwood Inn in 1920. Worthington hired “a Scotsman with a flock of sheep and dogs” to keep the fairways trim, but the efforts were not successful. He then designed the gang mower to maintain the golf course, and this led to the establishment of the Shawnee Mower Factory, which sold gang mowers all over the United States.\nThe annual Shawnee Open attracted well-known golfers such as Harry Vardon, Ted Ray, Freddie McLeod, and Alex Smith. At the 1913 tournament, Worthington sent a letter to participants suggesting that they get together and organize. The Buckwood Inn hosted the PGA Championship in 1938, and an excerpt from the program stated, “It was the thought expressed in that letter that gave the boys the idea of forming a professional association.\" Paul Runyan defeated resident pro Sam Snead 8 and 7 in the title match. \nIn 1943 bandleader Fred Waring purchased the resort, renamed it the Shawnee Inn, and broadcast his radio shows from the Shawnee Playhouse, a half-mile down the road. Jackie Gleason took up golf there in 1944, while Art Carney, Lucille Ball, Ed Sullivan and Perry Como would make regular appearances at the resort. Arnold Palmer met his wife Winnie at the Shawnee Inn when she was working at the clubhouse in 1954.\" \nIn 1964 the golf course was expanded from eighteen to twenty-seven holes, with nine new holes designed by Bill Diddle. Jason Scott Deegan of \"Golf Advisor\" wrote, “Where Tillinghast holes begin and where Diddle ends can be confusing, but they mesh well, nonetheless.” Twenty-four of the holes are on a private island in the Delaware River. Jesky wrote, “Several of the holes involve hitting across the Delaware River, and a 284-foot-long foot bridge helps golfers get there.” \nIn 1967 Hale Irwin won the NCAA Championship for the University of Colorado at the Shawnee Inn golf course. \nIn 1972 the resort merged with the American Landmark Corp. of Stroudsburg under developer Karl Hope. In 1974 he established the Shawnee Village, the first timeshare development in Pennsylvania. The Shawnee Inn began to offer skiing in 1975, and ski champion Jean-Claude Killy was hired to lead the new operation.\nBethlehem native Charles Kirkwood purchased the Shawnee Inn in 1977. The nine-hole, par-3 Tillinghast Approach Course, designed by Tom Doak, opened at the resort in 2006. "

Minnesota was making the school's first national championship match appearance. Stanford's sixth NCAA national championship was the most of any other program in Division I, although UCLA and Southern California had each won six overall national collegiate titles up to that point.\nOgonna Nnamani, the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, set an NCAA tournament record for kills in a tournament, as she had 165 in six matches, including 29 against Minnesota in the final. Nnamani also set the NCAA tournament record for kill attempts at 356. Stanford setter Bryn Kehoe became the first freshman setter to lead a team to an NCAA national championship.\nNational Semifinals.\nSouthern California vs. Minnesota.\nBehind 18 kills from Minnesota's Erin Martin, the Golden Gophers knocked out two-time defending NCAA Champion USC with a 3-1 decision to advance to their first NCAA Championship match in school history.\nStanford vs. Washington.\nStanford, the surprise of the tournament, came through with a 3–1 win over Pac-10 champion Washington. Ogonna Nnamani had 33 kills to lead Stanford to the championship match. During the regular season, Stanford and Washington split the match ups, with Washington sweeping the Cardinal in Seattle and Stanford returning the favor in Palo Alto by defeating the Huskies in five.\nNational Championship: Stanford vs. Minnesota.\nBehind 29 kills from Nnamani, Stanford completed their NCAA run by sweeping the Golden Gophers. Stanford easily won the first set, 30–23. The second was much closer, with Stanford going on a late run to win the second set, 30–27.\nThe third set was not competitive, which may have been due to an injury. Early in the third set, Minnesota's All-American libero, Paula Gentil, collided with a teammate while trying to dig a ball which left her unable to move on the court for over five minutes. Gentil was able to get up, but could not return to the match with a neck injury. Stanford won easily, 30–21.\nStanford's surprising run was due to the fact that they started out the season 15-6 and were ranked outside of the top ten in the beginning of the season. However, the Cardinal found momentum in the middle of the season, winning their last 15 matches including an upset of then-#1 and undefeated Washington in five sets.\nNCAA Tournament records.\nThere are four NCAA tournament records that were set in the 2004 tournament."

        "title": "Animal Boxing",
        "text": "Animal Boxing is a sports video game developed by Spanish studio Akaoni Studio for the Nintendo DS.\nGameplay.\nThe game involves boxing with over 50 various animals by using the touchscreen; the game is played with the DS held upside down so that the touch screen is above, which is then used to throw punches while the face buttons or d-pad, depending on the player's dominant hand, is used for defense. In single player mode, players control a customizable human, while in multiplayer mode, which can be played wirelessly against another player with a copy of the game, they can control a human or an animal.\nMatches in \"Animal Boxing\" are played under a special set of rules that make the game feel more like an arcade fighting game rather than a boxing simulator, in that there is no knockdown; the contestant who loses all health first loses the match outright in a technical knockout, although brief breaks are given to both fighters every time either of their health drops below one of two thresholds; if no TKO occurs within three rounds of play, the healthier fighter wins on a technicality. Taking and throwing punches also builds up a rage meter that temporarily boosts a fighter's damage output once it is completely filled. The player can also grab pickups that grant health or rage boosts, with the latter being more common. There are 24 belts to win in the single-player campaign mode, and a player must defeat a series of opponents in a single sitting to win a belt, with unlimited tries permitted against each opponent en route to the belt. The original physical release also supports Rumble Pak for force feedback.\nPlot.\nThe player character takes control of a human being who joins a community of animals in the Forest of Happiness. After they spent many months trying to fit in, a boxing gym opens, and all of the Forest's residents, along with their new human guest, begin training for the sport in a scramble for pugilistic supremacy. Working from the bottom, the player character challenges and defeats many animals to earn twenty-four belts, eight in each of three classes, to become the best boxer among them all. Amazed at their strength, the animals finally regard them as a friend.\nDevelopment and release.\nLead designer Jose M. Iñiguez, who avidly enjoyed boxing along with other martial arts, conceived \"Animal Boxing\" as a mix between thrilling martial arts sports action and comical cartoon characters. His development team was put under tight time and technical constraints in developing the game. They only had three-quarters of a year to complete it, which did not permit them to add significant enhancements to the gameplay experience, such as a combo system and more fleshed-out personalities for the various animal opponents. Memory constraints also made some of them difficult to design, such as an early model of a crocodile opponent taking up too much memory to the point where it crashed the DS.\nDestineer published a physical release of the game in 2008 exclusively in North America and Gammick Entertainment released a digital version of the game on DSiWare in 2011 in North America and Europe.\nReception.\nUpon release, \"Animal Boxing\" received scant reviews, with none of them being positive. Only two major reviews were submitted for each format. The physical release received a mediocre, lukewarm review from IGN, who praised the graphics and controls, while criticizing the gameplay, namely the lack of significant opponent diversity. IGN scored the physical release a 5.6 out of 10.\nThe digital release on DSiWare received more negative reviews, with Nintendo Life and Games Master UK directing criticism towards the game's artificial intelligence. The former also contended that its overall quality was not on par with its sold price of 800 points. Both reviewers gave this format a score of 40%.\nCarlos Campaña, the game's lead programmer, admitted that the game's rushed development indeed hampered the game's quality and made the fighting too repetitive."

The team capped off the 2003 season undefeated at 35-0, becoming the third team in NCAA history to accomplish the feat, the first repeat NCAA national champion to go undefeated, and the first team in the NCAA era to be ranked #1 in the coaches poll for the entire season.\nFlorida made the school's first national championship match in the program's seventh final four appearance. Minnesota also made the program's first NCAA final four appearance.\nRecords.\nThree teams in the 2003 NCAA Volleyball Tournament qualified with either 0 or 1 losses: USC (29-0), Hawaii (32-1), and Florida (31-1). It is the most recent tournament to feature at least three such teams.\nNational Semifinals.\nSouthern California vs. Minnesota.\nMinnesota, making their first NCAA Final Four appearance in program history, played top-seeded USC tough in the first two sets, falling 30-27, 30-28. USC rode the momentum in the third set, winning easily 30-20 to advance to the national championship match for the second consecutive year. USC's balanced attack consisted off three players with double digit kills, including Bibiana Candelas with 12, Keao Burdine with 13 and April Ross with 11. Minnesota was led by Cassie Busse with 23 kills and Erin Martin with 11.\nFlorida vs. Hawaii.\nFlorida and Hawaii battled in the second semifinal, with Florida looking to advance to their first final in school history after being 0-for-6 in previous NCAA semifinals, while Hawaii was looking to advance to their first final since 1996.\nBoth teams played even in the first two games, but it was Florida who won them by the scores of 30-28, 30-28. Hawaii answered back after the break to win 30-23. The 30-23 loss was the first individual game the Gators lost since August 23, breaking their NCAA record of 105 straight game wins. Florida and Hawaii once again played even in the fourth set, but Hawaii was unable to force a fifth set as Florida won the fourth set, 30-28. Hawaii was paced by AVCA National Player of the Year Kim Willoughby and Lily Kahumoku who both had 21 kills.\nNational Championship: Southern California vs. Florida.\nFlorida started out the match well by winning the first set off of undefeated Southern California. USC answered back by taking the second set 30-27 and used a 6-0 run in the third set to win easily, 30-19. In the fourth set, USC never trailed and led 22-15 before Florida mounted a comeback to cut USC's lead to 25-23. USC did not let up and won the fourth and final set 30-26 to cap off an undefeated season at 35-0. Florida ended their season at 36-2 with their only other loss coming to USC in the season opening AVCA Showcase tournament."

In 1927 he played against the New Zealand Maori rugby union team, and then in 1927 the New South Wales Waratahs. Jenkins gained his first cap for Wales team when he was selected to face the Waratahs again in their 1927 tour.

Under the captaincy of Ivor Jones, Wales lost their eighth consecutive game at Twickenham with the final score 8–3 to England. Jenkins may have gained further caps but when the next Welsh game was played on 2 February 1929, Jenkins was playing rugby league for Leeds RLFC, having switched codes for £370, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £64,000 in 2018).

He played representative level rugby union for Glamorgan (two occasions), and at club level for Swansea RFC. Having switched codes to rugby league he played representative level rugby league for Great Britain and Wales; and at club level for Oldham (Heritage № 479) and Belle Vue Rangers, as a .\nEarly life.\nPhillips was born in Neath, Wales on the day the Treaty of Versailles was signed and as a result was given the middle name of Versailles. As a schoolboy he played rugby union for Neath Schoolboys and was playing for Swansea RFC's first team when aged only 18. Two appearances for Glamorgan followed as well as two trials for the Welsh national side before the Second World War intervened and Phillips joined the army. During the war Phillips played for the Combined Services XV and featured in a rugby union match at Odsal Stadium, Bradford in April 1944 against the Combined Services rugby league XV. Phillips scored the opening try of the game although the league XV ran out 15–10 winners. Opposing Phillips in the rugby league XV were three players he would later tour Australia and New Zealand with; Ernest Ward, Ike Owens and Trevor Foster. Phillips performance in this game brought him to the attention of several rugby league clubs and he signed for Oldham towards the end of 1944.\nRugby league playing career.\nClub career.\nPhillips début for Oldham was on 17 February 1945 in a 16–0 victory over Batley. His army service presented Phillips from playing regularly and by the end of the 1945–46 season he had made only eight appearances for Oldham but had done enough to be called up to play both for Wales and Great Britain.\nFollowing his return from Australia and New Zealand in September 1946 Phillips played 10 more games for Oldham before being transferred to Belle Vue Rangers in January 1947 for a £1,000 transfer fee.\nRemaining with Belle Vue Rangers until 1953, Phillips made 253 appearances for the team scoring 28 tries. He made one appearance in the Lancashire County Cup final as Rangers lost 7–10 against Wigan in the 1947–48 final at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on 1 November 1947.\nHe retired from rugby league in April 1953 and returned to Neath.\nInternational career.\nPhillips was first selected to play for Wales in 1945 and went on to win 10 caps between 1945 and 1951 scoring a try in a game against England in 1949. Phillips was also selected to play for Great Britain and was a member of both the 1946 and 1950 touring teams to Australia and New Zealand being capped four times (three in 1946, one in 1950) against Australia."

        "text": "Daniel Brinley 'Bryn' Evans (16 January 1902 – 29 April 1970) was a Welsh international rugby union scrum-half who played for Wales and Swansea.\nRugby career.\nEvans originally played rugby for lower-tier club Penclawdd, whose senior team he captained during the 1929/30 season, before moving to first class side Swansea.\nEvans played only one game for Wales, against Scotland as part of the 1933 Home Nations Championship. Wales had just come away from an historic victory over England in the opening game of the competition, when the team won at Twickenham for the first time. Welsh hopes were high for the second game that was against Scotland at Swansea's home ground St Helens. The selectors wanted to stick with the same team that had beaten the English, but Maurice Turnbull had reported in injured. The selectors therefore decided to drop his partner, the reliable Harry Bowcott to allow for the Swansea partnership of Evans and Ron Morris to take their place. Although on home soil and against an inexperienced Scottish team, Wales lost 11–3, and Evans was dropped for the next match and never represented his country again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Taishō Baseball Girls",
        "text": " is a Japanese light novel series written by Atsushi Kagurazaka and illustrated by Sadaji Koike. Tokuma Shoten published four novels from April 2007 to June 2010. It has been adapted into a drama CD, a manga series serialized in \"Monthly Comic Ryū\", and an anime television series animated by J.C.Staff aired between July and September 2009. The anime had been licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks and Section23 Films released the complete collection on November 16, 2010.\nStory.\nIn 1925, after being told by a baseball player that women should become housewives instead of going to school, two 14-year-old Japanese high school girls named Koume and Akiko decide to start a baseball team in order to prove him wrong. During this time, when even running was considered too vulgar for women, baseball is known as \"what the boys do\" and they face many difficulties when having to find enough members, to get permission from their parents and also when learning about the sport itself.\nThe first book in the series opens in Taishō 14 (1925), introducing Koume, who is the 14-year-old daughter of a yōshoku restaurant owner, and a student at a local girls' academy. One day, Koume's friend, Akiko, asks her to join in an all-girl baseball team and have a match against a boys team. While the first volume can be read as a stand-alone work, the second volume develops the storyline further.\nThe second book is set in the summer of Taishō 14. Koume, Akiko, Manoe and the rest of the nine members of the Baseball Girls continue to face off against numerous all-boy teams, and have trouble dealing with the fast balls thrown by the boys. To combat the anxiety they experience, playing against more experienced teams, they decide to abandon their traditional baseball uniforms in favor of a kimono-style uniform. The girls also partition off the batter's box so that other teams cannot see what they are doing.\nApart from baseball, the series also deals with certain cultural changes that are not seen quite so often in anime. For example, the popular \"sailor\" school uniforms, now a staple of real-world Japanese schools, as well as school-based anime and manga, are only just being introduced into Japanese society during the Taishō period in which this work is based.\nCharacters.\nMain characters.\nThe main characters are the members of the girls' baseball team \"Ouka-kai\". Most of the girls are from class 1–2 and the team's coach is their homeroom teacher.\nMedia.\nAnime.\nAn anime television series adaptation animated by J.C.Staff was announced in August 2008 and aired for 12 episodes on TBS from July 2 to September 24, 2009, replacing \"K-On!\" in its timeslot. It was written and directed by Takashi Ikehata with character designs by Kanetoshi Kamimoto, who is known for his design work for Tomy toys. The anime was licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks and the complete collection was released on November 16, 2010.\nManga.\nA manga series by Shimpei Itoh was published in \"Monthly Comic Ryū\" from July 19, 2008, to February 19, 2011 and collected into five volumes."

He pitched all or parts of five seasons in the majors, from until , all with the Minnesota Twins.\nCareer.\nJackson was drafted by the Twins out of high school in 1973, but he did not sign with them. Instead, he played college baseball at Arizona State University, where he played in the College World Series in each of his last three seasons there.\nIn , he was drafted by the Twins in the 9th round of the amateur draft. He made his professional debut in 1978 for the Orlando Twins of the Southern League, and in his very first start he threw nine innings of no-hit ball against the Jacksonville Suns. Unfortunately, the game was tied after nine innings, and Jackson was relieved by fellow future Twin Jeff Holly. Orlando won the game, 1–0, in 12 innings.\nAfter just 10 starts in the minors, Jackson was called up to the Twins in June. In 19 games, Jackson went 4–6 with a 4.48 ERA. He did record one shutout in 1978, on July 7 against the Oakland Athletics.\nJackson split between the Twins and their Triple-A farm club, the Toledo Mud Hens. In the majors, he pitched in 24 games (including 8 starts), going 4–4 with a 4.28 ERA. was Jackson's first (and, as it turned out, only) full season in the majors. He set career bests in wins (9), ERA (3.87), and strikeouts (90). On June 21, 1980, Jackson recorded his one and only save at the MLB level. He retired the last batter of the game to preserve a 3-2 victory over the Twins.\nJackson spent most of on the sidelines with a shoulder injury, appearing in just 14 games in the majors and 2 at Triple-A. In , the bottom fell out of Jackson's performance, as he went 0–5 and his ERA jumped to a career-worst 6.25. Things were no better in the minors, as he went 1–3 with an even worse ERA of 7.00 in 4 starts. On July 26, the Twins released Jackson, and he never again pitched in organized baseball.\nJackson currently runs the 1020 Club, Inc.

        "text": "The Boys' Junior National Tennis Championship ( the USTA Boys 18s and 16s National Championships and nicknamed Nationals at the Zoo) takes place on the Kalamazoo College campus in Kalamazoo, Michigan. This United States Tennis Association (USTA) event is one of the most important competitions for male 16- and 18-year-olds tennis players, attracting 400 to compete from across the country.\nHistory.\nThe United States Tennis Association (USTA) is the national governing body in the United States for the sport of tennis. The USTA was originally known as the United States National Lawn Tennis Association in 1881. The name was changed first to U.S. Lawn Tennis Association, and to the present name in 1975.\nThe USTA has 17 different sections in different parts of the country, including: New England, Eastern, Middle States, Mid-Atlantic, Southern, Florida, Caribbean, Midwest, Northern, Missouri Valley, Texas, Southwest, Intermountain, Pacific Northwest, Northern California, Southern California, and Hawaii Pacific. Each of these sections have different regulations and procedures, but they all share the same mission statement:\nEach of the sections was started at a different time, as interest in the sport grew in that location. The USTA Midwest Section started in 1910 as the Western Lawn Tennis Association at the Chicago Beach Club in Chicago, Illinois. It originally controlled all of the tennis clubs west of the Alleghenies Mountains, and had great influence over the USTA at national meetings. When the USTA Midwest proposed a national clay court championship in 1910, the USTA agreed without dissent. In the 1920s, tennis became very popular in America and they started to train junior players.\nOriginally the tournament was held at West Side Tennis Club in Forrest Hills, New York from 1916 to 1920 and then again in 1927. It moved to Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts from 1921 to 1923. From 1924 to 1926 it was at South Side Tennis Club in Chicago, Illinois. Then it was at Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana from 1928 to 1942. Due to WWII, it was necessary to move the tournament from a military base. Dr. Allen Stowe influenced the USTA to relocate the tournament to Kalamazoo College, where he was a coach.\nNationals at the Zoo.\nIn 1943, the first \"Nationals at the Zoo\" (\"Zoo\" for Kalamazoo, Michigan) had 90 entries for the two age divisions: 18 and under and 16 and under. The event has become one of the most-important events for juniors, attracting 400 players from across the United States. The event takes place over a ten-day period from which there are winners in singles and doubles tennis. The winners from the Boys' 18 draw automatically receive a bid into the main draw of the U.S. Open Tournament. \nSome of the greatest names in men's tennis have participated: Rod Laver, Barry MacKay, Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Aaron Krickstein, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Pete Sampras, James Blake, Andy Roddick, Bob and Mike Bryan, Mike Franks, Jack Sock, and Jon Douglas. Laver (1956), Smith (1964), and Sock (2010, 2011) each won the Boys' 18 singles titles. Erik Menéndez played in the 1989 Nationals not two weeks before he and his brother Lyle murdered their parents. He was knocked out in the 2nd round of qualifying of the Boys' 18 singles.\nKalamazoo College's facilities include the Stowe Tennis Stadium which has eleven well-maintained hard courts outside, with seating for 3,000 spectators. The Markin Racquet Center has four indoor courts. Nearby Western Michigan University has made available their 20-court Raymond Sorensen complex for the growing tournament.\nSimilar events.\nThere are many events that are similar to the Junior National Tennis Championship. Girls' Championships have a similar event that takes place every year in San Diego, California for 16- and 18-year-olds. Along with having these great events in the US, there are also events all around the world. In Europe, there are tournaments for boys and girls. These events come in different age groups such as 12, 14, 16 and 18-and-under."

        "text": "John Craig \"Sonny\" Dixon (November 5, 1924 – November 19, 2011) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball for four seasons with the Washington Senators (1953–1954), Philadelphia / Kansas City Athletics (1954–1955) and New York Yankees (1956). A right-hander, the switch-hitting Dixon threw stood tall and weighed .\nSigned by the Senators prior to the 1941 season, Dixon served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II and missed three years (1943–1945) of his baseball career. He resumed pitching in 1946 and won 19 games for the Class B Charlotte Hornets. But it would take nine minor league seasons, and another 19-win campaign (in 1952 for the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts), to propel Dixon to the Major Leagues.\nHe worked in 43 games, with six starts, for Washington during his rookie 1953 season, and lost eight of 13 decisions, although he registered consecutive complete game victories against the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Browns on May 30 and June 4. On June 11, 1954, he was traded by Senators to the Chicago White Sox for fellow pitcher Gus Keriazakos, and then dealt the same day with pitcher Al Sima, outfielder Bill Wilson and $20,000 to the Philadelphia Athletics for hurler Morrie Martin and outfielder Ed McGhee. Dixon appeared in 54 games at season, 38 of them for the Athletics.\nOn May 11, 1955, Dixon and cash were sent by the Athletics, in their first year in Kansas City, to the New York Yankees in exchange for a couple of well-known veteran players: pitcher Johnny Sain and eventual Hall of Famer outfielder Enos Slaughter. He had appeared in only two games for the 1955 A's, and was sent to the Triple-A Denver Bears upon his acquisition by the Yanks. After an effective 1956 season in Triple-A, Dixon received his final big-league trial as a September call-up by the pennant-bound 1956 Yankees, and he was effective in three relief appearances. He then pitched exclusively in the minors through 1961, when he concluded an 18-year pro career.\nDuring his four seasons in the Majors, Sonny Dixon compiled an 11–18 career mark with a 4.17 earned run average, allowing 296 hits and 75 bases on balls in 263 innings pitched; he struck out 90 and recorded nine saves."

The tour was arranged as a replacement for the scheduled tour of India which was cancelled by BCCI following 2008 Mumbai attacks. The tour included 3 ODIs and 2 Tests.\nThe safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been in issue. In May 2002, New Zealand abandoned their Test series in Pakistan after a suicide bomb attack outside their hotel. Australia had recently refused to tour on safety grounds. In order to persuade the Sri Lankan team to visit, the Pakistan government offered to arrange \"presidential-style security.\", which they failed to provide, during the Second Test at Lahore, the Sri Lankan team were attacked by masked gunmen in a terror attack. Six members of the teams' security detail and two other civilians were killed. No cricketers were killed but five were listed as injured including Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan captain, and his deputy Kumar Sangakkara, Ajantha Mendis, Thilan Samaraweera and Tharanga Paranavitana.\nThis was the final tour of a visiting team in Pakistan until Zimbabwe toured in 2015."

A top putter of the era, Barber sank of putts on the last three holes of the final round to erase a four-stroke deficit to January and force a Monday playoff. At the 72nd hole, January had a two-stroke lead, but put his tee shot into the sand. With Barber on the green but an improbable away, January played conservatively for the bogey. Barber drained his third lengthy putt in as many holes (birdie-par-birdie) to even it up at the end of regulation.\nIn the playoff, the two were tied at three-under after 16 holes, following January's birdie.

Though Johnson and Prescott both had major league experience, only Ward and Windhorn would ever make a major league appearance after this deal. Midway through his first season in the Dodgers organization, he was dealt to the Minnesota Twins for Bert Cueto.\nA spring training injury to starting third baseman Rich Rollins opened the door for Ward to join the Twins early in the season.

        "text": "Ethnikos Piraeus Water Polo Club is the professional water polo team of Ethnikos OFPF (meaning: \"National Club of Fans of Piraeus and Phalerum,\" in Greek: \"Εθνικός Όμιλος Φιλάθλων Πειραιώς Φαλήρου\").\nEthnikos is one of the most successful and traditional water polo clubs in Greece. They hold (since 1957) the record for the most Greek water polo championships with 38. They have alson won 12 Greek water polo cups (eight of them are consecutive, which is a record) achieving 9 times the Double and 11 times the Central Greece Championship. Ethnikos has the record of 9 unbeaten doubles and the unique record of winning 18 championships in a row (from 1953 to 1970) and the second most with 14 in a row (from 1972 to 1985). Ethnikos holds the unique record for the most unbeaten championships with 29 (from which 11 are consecutive, which is also a record) and the record for consecutive years staying unbeaten in a match (13 years, from 1951 to 1964). Also, the club holds the record for most championships won exclusively with wins (19, 10 of which are consecutive, also a record).\nThe dominance of Ethnikos along with his longstanding records led to his given nickname, the “Emperor”.\nThe men's team was the first Greek club to reach the eight () and four () best teams in Europe. The team has been in the top-8 teams in Europe another eight times (1970, 1972, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1995).\nThe women's team won the LEN Trophy in 2010 and repeated its triumph in 2022 to become the Greek team with the most LEN Trophies.\nMany great players have played for Ethnikos throughout the years. The Greece men's national water polo team for many years consisted of Ethnikos players that have participated in the Olympics. The greatest personality in the history of the club is Andreas Garifallos, player, coach and president. In the Kastella neighborhood of Piraeus, the swimming pool bears his name in honour of his contribution to Piraeus and Greece water polo. Other great players that have played for Ethnikos are Ioannis Garifallos, Giannis Karalogos, Thomas Karalogos, Nondas Samartzidis, Kyriakos Iosifidis, Markellos Sitarenios, Sotirios Stathakis, Evangelos Patras, Konstantinos Kokkinakis, Filippos Kaiafas, Theodoros Kalakonas, Dimitrios Mazis, Christos Afroudakis, Antonios Aronis, Dimitrios Konstas, Dimitrios Kougevetopoulos, Antonios Vlontakis, Gerasimos Voltirakis, Anastasios Schizas, Chris Humbert, Wolf Wigo, Ashleigh Johnson, Iefke van Belkum, Stephania Haralabidis, Ioanna Haralabidis, Maria Tsouri, Aikaterini Oikonomopoulou, Sofia Iosifidou, Marina Canetti\nMen's team.\nSummary.\nEthnikos dominated in Greek Water Polo championship for decades. Since 1957, it has won the most Greek championships. It has additionally won 11 Central Greece Championships and 12 cups. During last years its power has been limited, and it has been relegated to the second division (A2 Ethniki) twice. In 1980, Ethnikos became the first Greek team to reach the Final-4 of LEN Champions League (the elite European club competition). Besides that, Ethnikos has reached the final-8 nine times. In 2003 the team took the third place in LEN Trophy (second tier European club competition). The club has an eternal rivalry with Olympiacos, the other club from Piraeus. The match between the two is dubbed as the “Piraeus derby”. Ethnikos had won six consecutive Greek cups (four of them against Olympiacos in the final) before the competition had a hiatus of 25 years that stopped Ethnikos from winning many more trophies and achieving more doubles.\n1925–1940 (Pre WWII years).\nThe club's first championship was won in 1926 under SEGAS with Ethnikos winning it undefeated with four wins in as many matches against N.O. Kastellas, Iraklis Thessaloniki, Aris Thessaloniki and Panionios Smyrna.\nOn July 31, 1927 Ethnikos was defeated in the final by Olympiakos 3–2 in a match that he appealed for a late goal scored by its opponent which led to extra time. The referee canceled the match as the timekeepers had tried to inform him of the end of the match (after all the score was at the time 2–1 in favor of Ethnikos). A replay was set for the third day of August but never took place. After days and meetings of the sports department of SEGAS with representatives of the two teams, a rematch is set to take place on the 16th of August. In the end, this match will not take place either, since Olympiacos insists on the opinion that they won the match, so it should be declared champion, while the Ethnikos side, since they are not given the title, since they consider that the match was over before Olympiacos equalized, agreed to play a replay match. On the 16th of the same month a meeting was held, where the Board of Directors of SEGAS cancelled the referee's decision to cancel the match on the 31st of July, and declares Olympiacos champion without a playoff match.\nThe first championship after the establishment of KOE (National Swimming Federation) came in 1931 with Ethnikos conquering it again undefeated by defeating the then three-time consecutive champion Aris Thessaloniki in the final with 1–0. The 1931 team consisted of Petroutsos, Dede, Perdikis, Mavrogeorgos, Makris, Stephopoulos, Hatzigeorgiou. The leading player of the team was Petroutsos, one of the leading pre-war swimmers along with Zografos of Aris and Provatopoulos of Olympiakos. Ethnikos on its way to the final beat P.A.O.K. (6–0), Iraklis Thessaloniki (3–1) and NO Patras in the semi-final (3–0).\nIn 1932, Ethnikos will not be able to defend its title since the federation will expel Ethnikos and Olympiakos from the championship due to major incidents in the match between them.\nIn 1933 and 1934 Ethnikos will lose the title in the final to Olympiakos (4–2 the score in both years) while in 1935 he will not participate in the games in Mytilini due to his punishment by KOE for not playing the decisive play-off match with Olympiakos for the final qualification ticket.\nIn 1936 and 1938 he will lose to Olympiakos in the first round and will be eliminated from the competition (then the championship had a knock out system).\nIn 1937, he will come second again, losing 3–2 in the final to NO Patras despite leading at halftime with 1–0.\nIn 1940 he will be defeated by KO Piraeus (1–0) in the first match and will be eliminated.\n1945–1952 (First post WWII years).\nIn the years 1945 and 1946 he will be ranked third. In 1945, he was eliminated after losing (4–1) to Olympiacos, while in 1946 he lost 4–2 to Olympiakos and 3–2 to the eventual champion NO Patras.\nThe third championship came 17 years after the second, in 1948, with Ethnikos winning it undefeated (wins over NO Patras 5–0, Aris 1–0, Olympiakos 5–1, NAO Kerkyra 5–0, NO Chalkida 7–2 and a draw against NO Mytilinis, 2–2). The coach of the team was Takis Sakellariou who played a modern and fast water polo in contrast to Olympiakos and NO Patras who played a physical and with less movement water polo.\nIn 1949, Ethnikos would lose the championship due to a draw with Palaio Faliro and a 3–1 loss to Olympiakos in a match where they played without their big gun, Andreas Garifallos due to injury.\nIn 1950, he lost to NO Patras and Olympiakos, finishing third.\nIn 1951 he would lose the title due to his defeat by Olympiakos with 2–1, while in 1952 he was very close to the title but the victory of Olympiakos with 3–2 over NO Patras combined with the draw of Ethnikos with the team from Patras (2–2) and the \"suicide\" of Ethnikos in the match against Olympiakos (3–3) while leading at half-time with 2–0, will lead the title to the \"red and whites\".\n1953–1986 (Domestic Dynasty).\nIn the following season, Ethnikos started his dynasty and won the championship undefeated for the first time after 5 years, achieving 4 wins and 1 draw in 5 games (3–3 with P. Faliro, victory over Mytilini, 10–1 victory over Achilleas Patras, 10–3 over Aris and 5–1 over Olympiakos on 18/9/1953 in front of an audience of 5,000 spectators at the Zappeion Olympic swimming pool).\nFrom 1953 to 1963, the blue and whites of Piraeus won 11 consecutive undefeated championships, a record that has not happened in any other sport. In the period 1953 to 1958 he won six consecutive cups before the competition discontinued.\nDuring the 1950s, he began a long unbeaten streak in league games, which lasted 13 years, a record that remains to this day. In particular, after losing 2–1 to Olympiakos on September 21, 1951, they were defeated again by the same opponent on August 7, 1964 with 5–4. In between he remained unbeaten in 75 matches, where he won 71 while 4 ended in draws. The last draw was recorded in a match against Palaio Faliro on September 19, 1953. After this match, a winning streak began, which lasted for 11 years and 64 league matches until the defeat in 1964. In fact, together with the cup matches from 1953 to 1958 unbeaten streak reaches a total of 95 games (91 wins, 4 draws).\nThe 75 consecutive unbeaten matches in the Greek championship were:\nThis group consisted of Andreas Garifallos, Petros Kalfamanolis, Mimi Georgiadis, Yiannis Thymaras, Manolis Patlakas, Dimitris Kourantis, Nikos Lekakis, Kalomiris, Andreadis, Petros Chatzikyriakakis, Panagiotis Chatzikyriakakis, Panagiotis Takousis.\nIn 1965, 1966 and 1967 he won the championship without defeat. In 1966 he will do the maxium with 10 wins in 10 matches, in 1965 9 wins and a draw with Olympiakos (0–0) while in 1967 he will score 4 wins and 2 draws (3–3 with OSFP and PAO) in 6 matches .\nOn 7/8/1968, exactly four years and 34 consecutive unbeaten matches after their last defeat in Greece, he loses to Olympiakos in the first round (7–6) but beats him in the second (7–5, with five goals from Garyfallos) in order to win the championship with the best goal difference. The championship would be decided in the matches of the two Piraeus teams against NOP in the second round. OSFP will win hard 9-7 while Ethnikis will win 11-3. At the end of the championship, Andreas Garifallos retires as a water polo player and continues his work in Greek water polo as a coach.\nIn the 1969 championship, according to the press of the time, the final between Olympiacos and Ethnikos never took place because Olympiacos did not compete due to the death of its president Kostas Bouzakis. The two teams were named \"co-champions\" (they had four wins in five games while the derby match between them ended 2–2).\nIn 1970 Ethnikos will win the championship undefeated with only one draw against Olympiakos. This was the 18th championship in a row and the last before Olympiacos breaks the streak.\nIn 1971, the team would lose the title for the first time since 1952 due to a loss to Olympiakos in the second play-off match (2–1). Nevertheless, he would continue a new series of championships from 1972 until 1985. During this time, he would win the championships of 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1979 without defeat. In fact, he built a new streak of almost four years without defeat since from 15/7/1973 until his loss on 5/6/1977.\nAlso, from 28/07/1978 and the 5–4 defeat by Olympiakos until its defeat on 05/06/1990 with 10–9 again by Olympiakos, Ethnikos was undefeated against compatriot Olympiakos in 29 consecutive matches (League and Cup, the last draw coming in 1979, 4–4) while on September 1, 1982, in the second round of the championship, he beat Olympiakos 0–13 (in 28 minutes, four 7 minute quarters). \nIn the 1980s, Ethnikos had Glyfada as their rival after Olympiacos had lost the power of the previous decades.\nIn 1981, the first year that the duration of the games was increased from 20 to 28 minutes (four seven-minute periods, instead of the four five-minute periods), Ethnikos will destroy most of its opponents with the exception of Glyfada. Indicative are the 11–3 and 11–5 victories over Olympiakos, 13–3 and 12–4 over PAO, 21–0 over Palaio Faliro, 22-–1 over Chios, 19–2 and 23–0 over Vouliagmeni, while the 1982 will beat OSFP with 9–2 and 13–0, Patras with 20–2 and 16–6, NOB with 15–7 and 15–3, PAO with 14–7, PAOK with 17–5 and Volos with 22-4.\nIn the 1980s, Ethnikos managed to remain unbeaten in the Greek league for almost six years and 101 consecutive league matches and including cup matches of the seasons 1983–84, 1984–85, for a total of 109 matches. In particular, after losing the penultimate matchday of the 1980 championship against Glyfada 3–5 on September 27, 1980, he was defeated again on May 10, 1986 by Vouliagmeni 7–8 in a game in which Ethnikis appealed for a late goal of Vouliagmeni. In between he won 5 consecutive unbeaten championships (1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985) and two cups (1984, 1985) in the restart of the competition, while of the 101 consecutive games without defeat he won 100 and recorded one draw. Of the 100 wins, 86 were consecutive (the longest winning streak in the league until 2016 when Olympiakos broke it), as after their defeat by Glyfada in 1980 the next match without a win was a draw 6–6 against the same team on August 24, 1985.\nThe 100 wins in the Greek Championship were briefly against the following opponents:\n1987–2002.\nIn 1986–87, all the experienced players of the previous decade have left and he competes with the newly acquired Samartzidis, Kaiafas, Patras, while Aronis, as in 1986, will compete in selected games due to obligations with his studies in the USA. 1987–88 saw the last undefeated championship with Ethnikos dominating Glyfada to take first place in regular time and thus home advantage in the finals. In the end, it will only take one match for Ethnikos to reach the limit of five points, with Ethnikos winning the final and with a combination of their victory and draw from regular time against Glyfada taking the title relatively comfortably. The day after winning the championship, he also wins the Cup at the Ilisio swimming pool against Vouliagmeni thanks to a great performance by the evergreen Aronis who, however, leaves at the end of the year, changing team but not city.\nIn 1988–89, despite finishing first in the regular season (tied with Glyfada), he will lose in the first final to Glyfada at home and thus the title.\nIn 1989–90 Ethnikos will have problems in the regular season and despite the fact that he finishes second as in 1987, it has already lost three times (to Glyfada, Chios and Olympiakos). In the first stage of the playoffs, he will lose to Iraklis in Piraeus, but he will qualify for the semi-finals where, despite the fact that he had beaten Vouliagmeni twice in regular time, he will not be able to get the draw to qualify for the finals and so he will lose three games in a row (two at home) and for the first time since 1951 he will finish third.\nIn 1990–91, Ethnikos will return to a title by winning the Cup as an outsider, defeating Glyfada with 10–7 held at OAKA pool, while in the championship he finished fourth (regular season and final four) behind Vouliagmeni, Glyfada and Olympiakos.\nIn 1991–92 he would finish second behind champions Olympiakos in a season where Ethnikis did not start well but found their footing towards the end of the season and especially in the final four stage where the best four teams participated. He beat twice Vouliagmeni and once Olympiakos in the final stage.\nIn 1992–93, he would finish third in the regular season and the final phase.\nIn 1993–94, Ethnikos, coached by Lino Repetto for a short time at the beginning and Kyriakos Iosifidis for most of the season, took first place in the regular season with a record of 17 wins 4 draws and 1 loss making the best regular season since 1988–89. In the playoffs, he faces Iraklis in the quarter-final stage and wins the series 2–0. In the semi-finals against NO Patras he wins 2–0 and then faces Olympiakos with a home advantage for the title. In the first tense match where eight players were sent off, Ethnikos wins 11–10 thanks to a goal in the last second of the match by Manousos Vizyrakis. In the second match, Olympiacos gets the win at the last minute of the game and evens the series (10–9) sending the title to a third and final game. There, Ethnikos leads 6–4 but Olympiacos reacted and sent the final to overtime while having two shots at the post three seconds before the end of the match (8–8 regular time). In extra time, Olympiacos will score with Vlachos and will be close to the title, but 13 seconds before the end of extra time, Samartzidis scores a penalty and thus the final goes to penalties. Voltyrakis of the \"red and white\" will save two penalties, but Patras of the \"blue and white\" three with one additional pentaly shot by Olympiakos hitting the post. \nIn 1994–95, Ethnikos finished second in the regular season and reached the finals by eliminating Chania and Glyfada with 2–0 victories, but would lose the championship to Olympiakos in a close series of finals.\nIn 1995–96 he finished fourth in the regular season and was eliminated by Vouliagmeni in the semi-finals of the league but remained unbeaten against their \"eternal\" rival and eventual champion Olympiakos, winning 9–8 (10/4/1996) and drawing 10–10 (2/12/1995). This is the only time a champion team has failed to beat a specific opponent during a season. In May of 1996 occurred the fatal accident of team's captain and legend Samartzidis, which greatly affected the Piraeus team.\nIn the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons, Ethnikos will face internal administrative and financial problems with the team having their worst years up to that point. Patras, Kaifas, Moustakarias have left and the team now relies on Kalakonas, Kourtidis, while it is also necessary to develop the young Kokkinakis, Schizas, Stellatos, Blanis. In 1998 he finished three points above the relegation zone. Nevertheless, in 1997 he managed to make it very difficult for the later champion Vouliagmeni, losing in the first stage of the playoffs with 2–1 victories, while his one defeat came in overtime.\nIn 1998–99 and 1999–00 he showed a slight improvement, finishing sixth and fifth respectively. In 2000 the team won the Cup in the final four held in Nikaia despite being the heavy underdogs. Coached by then 30-year-old Giorgos Morfesis, Ethnikos eliminated Vouliagmeni in the semi-final (13–12 in extra time), while in the final they beat the eternal rival Olympiakos 12–11 in extra time who was coached by Yugoslav legend Nikola Stamenic.\nIn 2000–01 and 2001–02 he finished third in the league. In 2001 he was eliminated by Olympiakos in the semi-finals and in 2002 by Vouliagmeni. In 2002, he beat Panthinaikos for the third place and the exit to the LEN Trophy.\n2003–2008.\nIn 2002–03 coached by Dragan Matutinović, Ethnikos men's team competed in the semi-finals of the LEN Trophy, but were knocked out by eventual cup winners Brescia and finished third together with Italian side Savona. In the domestic championship they took the third place. A landmark of the year was the resounding transfer of Vlontakis, one of the best strikers in the world at the time, from the European champion, Olympiakos, as well as Makis Voltyrakis, who had just retired.\nIn 2003–04 with Voltyrakis now as coach, Ethnikos would finish fifth, disappointing the ambitions that had been created to contest for the championship against Olympiakos and Vouliagmeni.\nIn 2004–05, Ethnikos having a very good regular season would finish first in the regular season for the first time since '94 (with Vlontakis being declared top scorer) but would lose the title in the fifth final to OSFP, a final with riots occurring at the stands between fans of the two teams and the police. Earlier that year Ethnikos had won the 12th Greek Cup by defeating NO Patras in the final of Thessaloniki. In the semi-final which was more of a final, Ethnikos had to overcome the resistance of Olympiakos with 11–9.\nIn 2005–06, although Ethnikos drew once and lost once to Olympiakos in the regular season meetings to finish second in the regular season, meaning Ethnikos had home court disadvantage in the finals, they managed to win the 38th championship in the last fifth game decided in overtime by a score of 7–6. Hatzikyriakakis scored the winning goal five seconds before the end, Olympiacos was awarded with a penalty at the last seconds of the extra time and with a goal would send the final to the penalty shootout as in 1994 but Karabetsos saved it. The championship was dedicated to the memory of the late great captain Nondas Samartzidis. This was the 20th time that Ethnikos won the championship and left Olympiakos second.\nIn 2006–07, the management of Ethnikos, wanting to keep Ethnikos in a leading role, carried out major transfers. They repatriated with a huge price Christos Afroudakis who played in Pozilipo Napoli, brings to Piraeus the goalkeeper of the national team of Serbia, Denis Sefik, while Thodoris Kalakonas, a child who grew up in the club (1990–2001, his first tenure) returned from Panionios. However, Ethnikos could not look strong and will easily lose the Cup final in Kalamata to Olympiakos. In Europe, the blue and whites would be knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League by Partizan and Brescia, and despite improving in the league playoffs, they would only look competitive in the first two finals, losing the first and winning the second in extra time. Thus Ethnikos lost the championship title 3–1.\nIn 2007–08, weakened after Sefik and Afroudakis's departure, Ethnikos will not be able to show the resistance he showed in previous years, losing in the semi-final of the Cup to Olympiacos as well as the championship.\n2009–present.\nIn 2008–09 the team, after administrative turmoil and the departure of funder George Vasilopoulos as well as of several players (Vlontakis, Mazis, Mylonakis, Karabetsos) some of whom had grown up in the club (Kokkinakis, Blanis, Stellatos), had a bad year and was relegated to A2 for first time since 1928. He bounced back immediately but in 2011–12 he will be relegated for the second time without winning a match. The parent club was in major crisis, with the future looking extrremely ominous and uncertain. The following season 2012–13, despite the fact that the team was on the verge of extinction and with the main goal of staying in A2, it will be unexpectedly promoted thanks to the management of president Antonis Printezis and the financing of Alexandros Karydopoulos and will play again in A1 in 2013–14 where Ethnikos would be ranked. While Kostas Petrakis was initially the coach for the season, Fanis Kountoudios took over from November 2013, a coach who remains to this day, having completed a decade at the club.\nIn 2014–15 they had a great regular season and finished second for the first time since 2008, but in the semi-finals of the league playoffs they will be eliminated by PAO and miss out on playing Olympiakos in the finals.\nIn the very next season, they will again reach the semi-finals of the championship as in 2018–19 when they were eliminated by the champion Olympiakos.\nIn 2019–20 the team would reach the final of the Greek Cup for the first time since 2007 but would lose the final to the superior OSFP.\nIn 2020–21 in a year severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Ethnikos finished at the bottom of a fourteen team one-round league and luckily there was no team relegation.\nIn 2021–22 and 2022–23 it finished seventh out of sixteen teams with one of the lowest budgets in the division while also reaching the final four of the cup in 2023.\nIn total, since 2014, he has won a European ticket four times but did not take advantage of it due to financial weakness, while he has promoted players from an early age in the championship by giving them playing time (Argyropoulos, Chondrokoukis, Mathiopoulos).\nTom Hoad Cup.\nEthnikos Piraeus took part in the Tom Hoad Cup at the Melville Water Polo Club, Fremantle, Australia. There were six teams competing from around the world: the Fremantle Mariners (Australia), Ethnikos Piraeus (Greece), Galatasaray Water Polo Team (Turkey), Japan National Water Polo Team, The Barbarians and a composite European team including three Hungarian Olympic gold medalists. The competition took place from the 27th-30 December 2008, with gold going to The Barbarians.\nWomen's team.\nThe women's team of Ethnikos has won 3 championships and 2 European cups (LEN Trophy). The current season (2022–23) is competing in the first division championship (A1 Ethniki). The team has competed in every season of the Greek League since it was established in 1989 (35 appearances)."

        "text": "Ron Roberts (1927–2003) was an Australian rugby league footballer. He was a state and national representative, who is known for scoring a try in 1950 which won Australia an Ashes series. His club career was with the St. George Dragons and he was a member of their 1949 premiership-winning side.\nPlaying career.\nRoberts joined St. George in 1949 and played three seasons with the club as a winger. That first year he scored two tries in the Dragons'\n1949 Grand Final victory over the South Sydney Rabbitohs and was the League's season top try scorer with 25 tries from 19 games. He made his representative debut for New South Wales that year and was selected for Australia's tour of New Zealand appearing in five minor matches and making his full representative debut in the 2nd Test in Auckland. Roberts is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 269.\nRoberts was competition's leading try scorer in 1949 and 1950. In his three seasons with the Dragons, he scored 51 tries in 51 first grade games.\nDefining moment.\nFor the first two Tests of the 1950 domestic Ashes series against Great Britain, Roberts was overlooked by selectors for other wingers including his club teammate Noel Pidding. The series was locked at 1–all after two games. The decider was played on a quagmire at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Roberts had regained his national wing spot after a one-year absence. Rain had been consistent in the lead up week and before the match forty tonnes of sand were dumped on the SCG to save the match from abandonment. Fourteen minutes from the end in pouring rain with the scores locked 2–all, Australia executed a back-line movement from a play-the-ball. An overlap developed by Doug McRitchie resulting in centre Keith Middleton sending the ball out to an unmarked Roberts who ran 40 metres and crossed in the corner for the only try of the match and a 5–2 win.\nThe victory gave Australia the Ashes for the first time since 1920 and as a result the memorable impact of that moment dwarfed Roberts' short but classy career. In a 1980s poll by \"Rugby League Week\" that try was rated the greatest single moment in the code's Australian history.\nContract dispute and departure from NSWRFL.\nDuring the 1951/1952 off-season, Roberts changed his address so that under the NSWRFL's strict residential laws of the time, he became required to play for Canterbury-Bankstown, which is had no desire to do. He was also involved in a contractual dispute with the Dragons, whereby Roberts and fellow Dragon three-quarter Matt McCoy felt that their talents entitled them to more money than the seasonal bonus of £330 then offered to players. The Dragons refused this and did not include Roberts amongst their list of 47 players, with the result that he played for Picton in the Group 6 competition and represented Country that winter. In 1954 Roberts would shift to captain-coach Bargo in that same league and again represent Country."

        "title": "Revolution (cycling series)",
        "text": "Revolution is a series of track cycling events primarily held at the Manchester Velodrome in the north west of England. It was solely held in Manchester between 2003 and 2012. From Season 10 (2012–2013) meetings have been held additionally at the new UK velodromes; in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, Glasgow, the Olympic Velodrome, London from Season 11 (2013–2014) and the Derby Arena from 2015 to 2016.\nThe series comprises four or five meetings each year, held between October and February, on Saturday evenings. The series showcases various top cyclists, both British and international, and is well attended by spectators. The recent success of the British team, including Chris Hoy's triple gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics and double gold-winning performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics has meant that the events now regularly sell out in advance.\nConcept.\nThe series was founded in 2003, with the main aim of providing regular track cycling events for fans to attend in Manchester. Previously, track cycling fans were generally only able to attend one international event in Manchester each year, usually a round of the UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics series, or as in 2000, the UCI Track Cycling World Championships. The only other events held regularly at the velodrome were events such as the British National Track Championships, which have a lower profile and therefore attracted smaller crowds.\nAn organisation management company, Face Partnership, was brought in to attempt to create a series providing regular top level events at the velodrome. The aim was to provide racing for existing fans and attract new fans to the sport, raising its profile as a sport in United Kingdom. It was also intended to give British riders the opportunity to take part in high quality racing during the winter. It was decided that the series would consist of four events throughout the season. Admission costs were fixed at an affordable level, originally £8 for an adult ticket, in order to enable families to attend. Family tickets were available for around £20, making the Revolution a considerably more affordable event to attend in comparison to other sports, such as football.\nThe first event was held in October 2003 and was attended by a good sized crowd. The event featured big British names like Bradley Wiggins, Rob Hayles, Chris Newton, John Scripps and David Millar. The series also rapidly attracted the attention of track sprinters from continental Europe, who took advantage of the opportunity to sharpen their skills against top-class fields without the levels of pressure experienced in World Cup events. The event continued to grow in stature and profile from this solid start, exceeding expected attendance targets along the way. Revolution 7 in early 2005 saw the series achieve its first near capacity crowd, the start of the event had to be delayed to allow the crowds into the venue. Revolution 14 was the series' first complete sell out, with some ticketless fans turned away. From early 2008 onwards the events began to sell out in advance.\nThe Revolution is also expanding into a global series, CotterPin has licensed the concept in Australia. The first Revolution Australia event was held in the Darebin International Sports Centre, Melbourne on 24 November 2007. There were over 3,000 spectators present at Australia's Revolution 1.\nIn July 2008, the Aftermarket company signed a deal with Face Partnership to create an expo area in the track centre at each event. This takes advantage of the captive audience and precise target consumers present at each Revolution.\nEach Revolution meeting consists of a fast-paced, packed programme of races. The evening lasts for between 3 hours and 3 hours 45 minutes and typically involves around twenty events. Each event has three categories of racing including sprint and endurance, and the \"Future Stars\" series. Live PA duties at the events are carried out by the BBC commentator and cyclist, Hugh Porter.\nIn 2011–12, ITV4 broadcast a one-hour highlights show on Monday evenings following each Revolution meeting.\nIn September 2015 it was announced that Eurosport would broadcast live coverage of five rounds of the 2015–16 series.\nIn April 2016 a collaboration between FACE Partnership and Velon, an organisation representing 11 UCI WorldTeams, was announced to expand the Revolution series internationally as the Revolution Champions League, with the inaugural Champions League competition being held across three consecutive weekends in November and December 2016. The competition is planned to feature a total of 12 teams, of which eight will be drawn from the World Tour ranks. In June 2016 seven WorldTeams were confirmed as participants in the first Champions League, which would consist of six rounds held over three back-to-back weekends in Manchester, London and a third venue abroad, which was confirmed the following month as the Vélodrome National in Paris. However shortly before the Paris meeting was due to take place FACE Partnership announced that it would be postponed to the following season.\nCompetitions.\nSprint racing.\nEach meeting features a main Revolution Sprint competition, alongside other various events including the Keirin and Team sprint. The sprint competition is usually a straight knock out event, typically with a first round, semifinal and final. For some events a sprint omnium has taken place, with all riders facing each other at some point during the evening and the most successful winning overall. A male sprinting competition usually takes place at each event, with Women's sprinting generally appearing for one event each year also.\nThe events featured alongside the main sprint competition are tailored to the card of sprinters appearing and has included various challenges and revenge matches over the years. They regularly attract major British names and a host of international challenges. The list of World and Olympic Champions to have appeared include Chris Hoy, Theo Bos, Arnaud Tournant, Jason Kenny, Victoria Pendleton, Jamie Staff, Jens Fiedler, Grégory Baugé, Ross Edgar, Craig MacLean, Jason Queally, René Wolff, Jan van Eijden, Florian Rousseau, Stefan Nimke, Maximilian Levy, Teun Mulder, Robert Förstemann, Mickaël Bourgain, Willy Kanis, Matthew Rotherham, Christina Muche and Clara Sanchez.\nEndurance racing.\nEvery Revolution event has included elite endurance field of riders, racing over a number of events throughout the night. Events featured include the points race, scratch race, Madison, individual pursuit, team pursuit, motor-paced scratch race and devil elimination scratch race. Typically the blue ribbon Madison feature race takes place once a year and is named the Isaac Gálvez Memorial Madison. This is in memory of the Spanish rider who died during the Ghent Six Day meeting in 2006 while he was World Madison Champion. This was one week before he was due to appear at Revolution 15.\nThe endurance racing attracts both major track riders and stars of the road, throwing up a number of unique contests over the years. The list of major names (on the track or the road) to have appeared include Bradley Wiggins, Mark Cavendish, Geraint Thomas, Ed Clancy, Joan Llaneras, Paul Manning, Bradley McGee, Chris Newton, Rob Hayles, Sergi Escobar, Steve Cummings, Stuart O'Grady, Iljo Keisse, Matthew Gilmore, Franco Marvulli, Bruno Risi, David Millar, Peter Schep, Robert Slippens, Nicole Cooke, Rebecca Romero and Graeme Obree.\nFeature and exclusive races.\nAs well including the major events from the World Championships and Olympics, the Revolution series also tries to feature some unique and exclusive races at its events. The Madison 1 km time trial is one such exclusive event. This event is a major crowd pleaser and takes place at each event. This is run over 1 km, four laps of the track, and consists of two riders running two laps each. After the first rider has completed their laps they do a Madison hand sling with their partner and they then complete the final two laps. While this by nature is an endurance riders event, its one kilometre distance has also meant that sprinters have also tasted success.\nAn early record for this event was set by Mark Cavendish and Ed Clancy at 58.5 Seconds at Revolution 7 in January 2005. This record stood until sprinters Craig MacLean and Arnaud Tournant, set a new record of 55.1 seconds at Revolution 16 in January 2007. This was then further bettered when Tournant teamed up with Chris Hoy at Revolution 20 in February 2008. Tournant had a shoulder injury which prevented the duo doing a proper hand sling change over, however they still posted a record time of 54.4 seconds. This record stood until being broken by Ed Clancy and Ollie Wood in 2014.\nA new challenge event added to the programme in 2008 was the sprinters v pursuiters challenge. The first of these races took place at Revolution 21. This saw members of the GB Team sprint squad, Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Ross Edgar, face off against members of the GB team pursuit squad, Ed Clancy, Geraint Thomas and Steven Burke. The race took place over three laps with a flying start, so very much was a mix between the sprint and endurance disciplines. Due to the three lap length of the race, the same as the Team Sprint event, it was expected by its nature to favour the sprint squad. However it was noted that the endurance squad regularly carry out similar short drills during training, so the playing field was quite level going into the event. The endurance squad were able to turn the flying start to their advantage and took a clean victory over the sprinters.\nA rematch took place at Revolution 22, with the race extended to four laps with a standing start on this occasion. Matthew Crampton joined the sprint squad and Rob Hayles joined the endurance squad. The fast start of Jamie Staff allowed the sprint squad to take revenge and level the series. It is expected that this unique challenge event may return at future events.\nOther special events have included the Geoff Thomas Charity Challenge Race at Revolution 20. This involved Geoff captaining a team of riders against England Rugby World Cup winning Captain, now England coach, the 6 ft 7 inches tall Martin Johnson. This was a 5 lap team sprint style challenge race, with each team including star riders like Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, Arnaud Tournant and Peter Schep. The teams were drawn at the start of the evening, equally sharing out the riders. Team Thomas won by 0.1 seconds and raised a good sum of money for the Geoff Thomas Charity Foundation.\nWomen's omnium.\nThe second round of the 2012–2013 Revolution series (round 38 in Manchester) included a women's omnium event. The Dutch Marianne Vos won, including the elimination race, this omnium event ahead of the British Lizzie Armitstead. Ellen van Dijk from the Netherlands won the points race, Katie Colclough the scratch race and the British team the team pursuit.\nFuture Stars series.\nAlongside the senior racing, the Future Stars competition also runs at each Revolution event. This series involves young riders, usually 14- to 16-year-olds and provides them to race in front of big crowds from an early age. They are put through a number of sprint and endurance races. Points are scored in each race and count towards the overall leader board. The winner is crowned at the end of the four meeting series.\nSome youngsters of these series became later elite athletes. Including Jason Kenny, who by the age of 24 already three gold Olympic medals and one silver. Another multiple Olympic Champion is Laura Trott, who won two gold medals at London 2012 at the age of 20 years. Other Olympic medalists include Steven Burke (one gold and one bronze), Peter Kennaugh (one gold), Dani King (one gold) and Lizzie Armitstead (one silver). The London 2012 Olympic squad included a large numbers of riders to have come through the series."

        "text": " \nSince 1908 Australia and Wales have competed against each other in rugby union in 46 matches, Australia having won 31, Wales 14, with 1 draw. Since 2007 the teams have competed for the James Bevan Trophy, which was created to celebrate 100 years of rugby between the two nations.\nHistory.\nIn the first 70 years, Wales won six of the eight matches. Over the next 10 years it was fairly even, but since the first World Cup in 1987, Australia has dominated by 26 wins to 6. The 2006 match ended in the second highest-scoring draw of all time, 29–29.\nAustralia snatched victory in the inaugural James Bevan Trophy test match 29–23 with a last minute try at the Telstra Stadium in Sydney on 26 May 2007. They followed this up with a 31–0 victory at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.\nWales captured the trophy the following year with a 21–18 victory in Cardiff, but since then it remained in Australian hands with 13 consecutive wins. Three victories in Cardiff in 2009–11 were followed up by a 3–0 series win in Australia in 2012, all by narrow margins. In the return match at Cardiff, Australia once again won with a last minute try.\nThe 2011 Rugby World Cup brought Australia and Wales together again for another third-place play-off, and once again it was a close finish, with Australia claiming third place in a reversal of the first World Cup in 1987, when Wales won the play-off 22–21.\nWales ended a run of 13 consecutive defeats against Australia on 10 November 2018, winning 9–6. They have since defeated Australia 29–25 in the 2019 Rugby World Cup, 29–28 in Cardiff on 20 November 2021 and a record 40-6 in the 2023 Rugby World Cup."

The race was won by the Italian rider Giovanni Valetti of the Fréjus team, with fellow Italians Gino Bartali and Mario Vicini coming in second and third respectively.\nValetti had the lead halfway the race.

Bartali attacked on the last stage, but Valetti stayed in his wake and won the race.\nParticipants.\nOf the 89 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 28 April, 54 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 18 May. Riders were allowed to ride as a member of a team or group; 56 riders competed as part of a team, while the remaining 33 competed as a part of a group. The eight teams that partook in the race were: Bianchi, Fréjus, Ganna, Gloria, Legnano, Lygie, Olympia, and Belgium. The teams ranged from six to eight riders each. There were also seven groups, made up of three to five riders each, that participated in the race. Those groups were: U.S. Azzini, Dopolavoro Di Novi, S.S.

The field featured three former Giro d'Italia winners with two-time winner Gino Bartali, Vasco Bergamaschi who won the 1935 edition, and reigning champion Giovanni Valetti. Other notable Italian riders included Olimpio Bizzi, Ezio Cecchi, and Cino Cinelli.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification. The group classification was decided in the same manner, but the classification was exclusive to the competing groups.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

He also played a few games at other positions, including shortstop, first baseman and outfielder.\nCollins was signed by the Mets as an amateur free agent on January 1, 1964 after a high school career at Springfield Tech High School. He began his professional career in 1964 with the Florida Mets, the Mets Rookie League minor league baseball team. He played in 44 games that season, getting 118 at bats and posting a batting average of .220.\nIn 1965, Collins made his major league debut with the Mets on September 1. He played in 11 games for the Mets in 1965, splitting time between third base and shortstop, getting 23 at-bats and a batting average of .174. At age 19 years, 28 days, he was the 4th youngest player to appear in the major leagues that season.\nIn 1966, Collins played the entire season in the minor leagues at the Mets class-AA affiliate, the Williamsport Mets. Collins appeared in 122 games for Williamsport, almost entirely as a shortstop, and batted .251 with 6 home runs in 411 at-bats. He earned Eastern League all star honors in 1966.\nCollins was promoted to the Jacksonville Suns, the Mets class-AAA affiliate in 1967. There, he played several infield positions, sharing time at second base with Ken Boswell, at shortstop with Sandy Alomar Sr. and at third base with Amos Otis. In all, Collins played 119 games for Jacksonville in 1967, getting 420 at-bats and 3 home runs, with a batting average of .248, a slugging percentage of .321 and an on-base percentage of .289. Collins also played in 4 games with the Mets in September 1967, getting one hit in ten at-bats.\nIn 1968, Collins again started the year with Jacksonville. He played 28 games at Tidewater, batting .248 in 101 at-bats before being promoted to the Mets. With the Mets in 1968, Collins played in 58 games, mostly as a third baseman. He batted .201 in 154 at-bats. He also hit his first Major League home run that season, on August 6.\nCollins began the 1969 season with the Mets. He played 16 games for the Mets, all at third base, getting 40 at-bats but only batting .150. His last game with the Mets before being demoted to the Mets new class-AAA affiliate in Tidewater was on May 4. Collins played in 11 games for Tidewater, batting .250 in 32 at-bats before being traded to the Montreal Expos.\nOn June 15, 1969, Collins was traded to the Montreal Expos along with Steve Renko, Bill Carden and Dave Colon in exchange for Donn Clendenon. This was a momentous trade in Met history, since Clendenon would go on to be the World Series Most Valuable Player in 1969. Collins appeared in 52 games for the Expos in 1969, split between second base and third base. He batted .240 in 96 at-bats.\nAfter the 1969 season, Collins was sold by the Expos to the Detroit Tigers. With the Tigers in 1970, Collins played only 25 games, mostly as a pinch hitter. He played in only one game in the field, his only career game at first base. He batted .208 in 24 at-bats for the Tigers that season.\nCollins only played in 35 games with the Tigers in 1971, and again only a few in the field. In 1971 he played some games at third base, second base and in the outfield. He batted .268 in 41 at-bats, the highest batting average in his major league career.\nIn June, 1973, Collins was traded by the Tigers along with Tom Timmermann to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Ed Farmer. Collins never played a game for the Indians and never played a major league game after the trade.\nAfter a few more minor league seasons, Collins retired from baseball in 1974. He declined the opportunity to remain with the Indians as a coach or scout. After retirement, he worked in the automotive supply business, losing part of his right foot in a warehouse accident in 1993.\nHe was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and died in Naples, Florida."

        "text": "The luge competition events of the 2010 Winter Olympics were held between 13 and 17 February 2010 at the Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada.\nMedal summary.\nEvents.\nThree luge events were held at the games:\nQualifying.\nAthlete/NOC quota.\nIn accordance with the International Olympic Committee and the International Luge Federation (FIL), 110 athletes were to be allowed to take part. This was to include 40 athletes for men's singles, 30 athletes for women's singles, and 20 doubles teams (40 athletes total). The 110-athlete maximum was set for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, and repeated for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Each NOC could enter up to 10 athletes (3 men's single, 3 women's single and 2 doubles).\nQualification system.\nAthletes were to be ranked by the number of world cup points they earned in the 2008–09 season and through the first half (before 31 December) of the 2009–10 season. To be eligible, athletes must either have earned medals and the world cup points in five World Cups, Nations Cup or Junior World Cup, or have a top-30 (men's single), top-20 (women's single) or top-16 (doubles) finish at the world cup during the qualification period. The top-40 men's single, top-30 women's single and top-20 doubles sleds were to be qualified for the Olympics, with unused quotas to be redistributed with priority given to unrepresented nations. The host nation (Canada) was to be guaranteed a sled in every event provided that they reached the minimum requirements.\nJury selection.\nOn 15 June 2009, the FIL announced their jury members for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The jury was to be headed by Josef Benz (Switzerland, chair of the FIL Sport Commission. Other jury members included Zianbeth Shattuck-Owen (United States), luge manager for the 2002 Games, and Markus Schmidt (Austria), men's singles bronze medalist at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Technical Delegate Executive Board consists of Björn Drydahl (Norway), Marie-Luise Rainer (Italy) and Walter Corey (Canada).\nDoping control.\nOn 21 July 2009, the FIL announced that blood doping controls would take place at the Olympics for the first time. FIL President Josef Fendt stated during the 57th Congress in Liberec, Czech Republic, that no positive test had occurred during the Viessmann World Cup or FIL ...[ European and World]... events despite the random testing done by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The last two doping offenses that occurred in the FIL to cannabis abuse and both athletes were punished by their national federations.\nFatality.\nThe Whistler Sliding Centre is acknowledged as the fastest track in the world and has a reputation of the most dangerous one. In the build-up to the games several teams had raised concerns about the safety of athletes. An FIL spokesman said on 12 February that there had been 2,500 runs with only a three-percent crash rate. However, a week prior to the incident athletes were remarking on the speed and technical difficulty of the track. Several minor accidents occurred on the track during training runs leading up to the start of the games.\nDuring a training session on 12 February, the Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died of injuries caused by a crash in the final turn of the course at speeds of , crashing into the side of the turn, sending him crashing into a steel support pillar. The FIL immediately called an emergency meeting after the incident, and all other training runs were called off for the day.\nInvestigations were conducted the same day, concluding that the accident was not caused by deficiencies in the track. As a preventative measure, the walls at the exit of curve 16 will be raised and a change in the ice profile will be made. A joint statement was issued by the FIL, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) over Kumaritashvili's death with training suspended for the rest of that day. According to the Coroners Service of British Columbia and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the cause was to Kumaritashvili coming out of turn 15 late and not compensating for turn 16. Because of this fatality, an extra of wall was added after the end of Turn 16 and the ice profile was changed. It also moved the men's singles luge event from its starthouse to the one for both the women's singles and men's doubles event. Kumaritashvili is the first Olympic athlete to die at the Winter Olympics in training since 1992 and the first luger to die in a practice event at the Winter Olympics since Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski of Great Britain was killed at the luge track used for the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck. It was also luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975 when an Italian luger was killed.\nThe women's singles and men's doubles start was moved to the Junior start house of the track, located after turn 5. Germany's Natalie Geisenberger complained that it was not a women's start but more of a \"kinder\" (\"child\" in German) start. Her teammate Tatjana Hüfner who had the fastest speed on two runs of stated that the new start position \"..does not help good starters like myself\". American Erin Hamlin stated the track was still demanding even after the distance was lessened from and that athletes were still hitting .\nDuring a 14 February 2010 interview with Yahoo! Sports, FIL Secretary-General Svein Romstad stated that the federation considered cancelling the luge competition in the wake of Kumaritashvili's death two days earlier. Romstad stated that \"[Kumaritashvili] ... made a mistake\" on the crash, but also stated that \"...any fatality is unnacceptable\". Additionally, Romstad stated that the start houses were moved to their current locations \"... mostly for an emotional reason\". Because of Kumaritashvili's death, the FIL worked with the organizing committee for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi over making the Sliding Center Sanki in Rzhanaya Polyana slower.\nDespite the changes, and celebrations by the victorious athletes, Kumaritashvili's death overshadowed the race. Some athletes who participated in the competition said they were scared during their runs, and welcomed the track changes. Others criticized the changes as having given an advantage to stronger starters like the German participants, as opposed to weaker starters who would have benefited from having a longer course. Argentina's Ruben Gonzalez said, \"God blessed the Germans today.\"\nHowever, media reports mentioned the changes positively after a doubles team, Austria's Tobias and Markus Schiegl, crashed in the same turn where Kumaritashvili was killed. Both of them emerged unhurt.\nOn 18 February 2010, FIL President Josef Fendt issued the following statement:\n\"At the conclusion of the luge competition at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games, our thoughts are with the family of Nodar Kumaritashvili. We again offer our heartfelt condolences to them, to his friends and to the entire Georgian Luge Federation. Nodar Kumaritashvili will forever stay in the hearts of all the members of the Luge family. \nThis has also been a difficult time for the Olympic athletes who competed in these Games. Their solidarity and sportsmanship was a tribute to the friend we lost. The International Luge Federation is touched by the outpouring of compassion and sympathy from people around the world. We will leave Whistler determined to do all we can to prevent a recurrence of this tragic event.\"\nDuring the ten actual competitive runs (four men single, four women single, and two doubles), there was only one crash which was Romania's Mihaela Chiras during the second run of the women's singles event. 12,000 spectators attended each of the five days of luge competition.\nOn 23 March 2010, FIL President Fendt, VANOC President John Furlong, 2010 men's singles gold medalist Felix Loch of Germany visited Kumaritashvili's grave in his hometown of Bakuriani to pay respects as part of tradition in the Georgian Orthodox Church.\nThe FIL published their reports in regards to Kumaritashvili's death following the FIL Commissions Meeting in St. Leonhard, Austria (near Salzburg) for both sport and technical commissions on 9–11 April 2010. This report was prepared by Romstad and Claire DelNegro, Vice-President Sport Artificial Track, who is from the United States.\nTelevision ratings.\nRatings in Germany for the luge events had six million viewers for the women's singles luge events, generating a 25.6 percent share and a 34 ranking according to ARD and ZDF. The last run of the men's singles event had a share of 30.3 percent (1.82 million viewers) while the third run of the event had been watched by 5.32 million viewers (17.1 percent market share). Despite being broadcast in the middle of the night in Germany, the doubles event had a 22.6 percent market share."

Sprint and individual Gundersen events of 7.5 km and 15 km events were replaced by two 10 km individual events with one jump each from the normal and large hills respectively. Team event went from two jumps down for one jump per team member. This was done during the 2008–09 Nordic Combined World Cup season and was also applied to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, Czech Republic.\nMedal summary.\nEvents.\nThree nordic combined events were held in Vancouver 2010 (all participants are men):\nQualification.\nFor the three events, there are a maximum 55 athletes allowed to compete. No nation can have more than five skiers. For each event, no nation can enter more than four skiers per nation per individual event or one team per nation per relay race.\nHost nation Canada is expected to enter skiers in all events. If no skier meets the qualification standards, they can enter one skier per event.\nQuota allocation per nation was based on the World Ranking List (WRL) based on Nordic Combined World Cup and Grand Prix points, followed by Continental Cup Standings from the 2008–09 and 2009–10 Nordic Combined World Cup. This was made by assigning one quota slot per skier from the top of the standings downwards until the maximum five slots have been reached, including host nation Canada. When 50 slots are reached in an event where less than ten nations have a minimum of four skiers allocated slot (and the nation is entered in the team event), the next nation with three skiers will be given a fourth slot until ten nations can compete in the team event. Any open quota slots will be allocated until the maximum 55 skiers can be reached, including host nation Canada. This process started on 18 January 2010 and will run until 28 January 2010. Deadline to VANOC is 1 February 2010.\nIf a skier from a nation selected for an event cannot compete due to injury or force majeure prior to the start of the first event based on quota allocation, a replacement can be used once the removed skier surrenders their accreditation prior to their replacement can be accredited.\nParticipating nations.\nA quota list was released by the FIS on 18 January 2010.\n14 countries participated."

On the 17th, both Hollingsworth and Montgomery had the fastest runs again.\nQualifying.\nMen's qualification.\nThe qualification was based on the 2009/2010 FIBT ranking list from January 17, 2010. A slider must be in the top 60 to be eligible for the Olympics. All current quota places are pending re-allocation of unwanted quotas and re-allocation quotas will go to unrepresented continents in priority.\nWomen's qualification.\nOnly sliders in the top 50 of the FIBT ranking may qualify for the Olympics.\nRomania was allocated the last quota from The Netherlands on 26 January 2010.\nAthlete/NOC quota.\n50 athletes are allowed to compete in accordance with the International Olympic Committee and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT). This includes 30 for the men's event and 20 for the women's event.\nQualification system.\nAthletes from five continents recognized by the FIBT are eligible to compete: Africa, Americas (North and South), Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Each continent has a maximum of one two-man or one four-man team and one two-woman team allowed. If no driver can meet these standards, the continent will not be represented. The best result of each driver will be ranked by the FIBT, including World Cup and lesser known Cup. These races scored are the same ones as the World Cup event. These skeleton racers must rank among the top 50 for men and top 40 for women in the FIBT for the 2009–10 season by 17 January 2010, held at St. Moritz, Switzerland. Each country is limited to a maximum of three per gender. For men's skeleton, three countries can send three teams, seven countries can send two teams, and seven more countries can send one team. For women's skeleton, two countries can send three teams, four countries can send two teams, and six countries can send one team. For both events, the host country is included provided they meet the minimum requirements. The NOCs must declare their entries by 22 January 2010. Entering the World Cup event in St. Moritz, the top two countries to have three women's skeleton competitors were Canada and Great Britain. For men's skeleton, the top three countries to have three teams were Germany, Canada, and the United States."

The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 12–0.\nRed Sox in the game.\nThe Red Sox hosted the game and were well-represented. Red Sox infielders Bobby Doerr and Johnny Pesky, along with outfielders Ted Williams and Dom DiMaggio, were in the AL starting lineup, while pitchers Dave Ferriss and Mickey Harris along with first baseman Rudy York and catcher Hal Wagner were also named to the team (of the Red Sox' reserves, only York played in the game).\nThis was the game in which Ted Williams became the only player to hit a home run against the famed \"Eephus pitch\" of Pittsburgh Pirates hurler Rip Sewell.\nStarting lineups.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nUmpires.\nThe umpires changed assignments in the middle of the fifth inning – Summers and Goetz swapped positions, also Boggess and Rommel swapped positions.\nSynopsis.\nThe NL threatened in the top of the first inning, having two men on with one out, but were unable to score. The AL scored two runs in the bottom of the first, on a home run by Charlie Keller. There was then little activity until Ted Williams hit a home run in the bottom of the fourth, followed by the AL sending nine men to the plate in the bottom of the fifth while scoring three runs. The AL later added six more runs, with the NL never threatening.\nTed Williams still (through 2016) holds five single-game All-Star Game Records, which were set in this game: hits (4), home runs (2), runs (4), RBI (5), and total bases (10). Note that MLB did not name an All-Star Game MVP until 1962.\nBecause the 1945 All-Star Game was canceled, Boston Braves manager Billy Southworth, who had managed the St. Louis Cardinals in 1944, was named a coach under Charley Grimm, while Steve O'Neill named Luke Sewell of the St. Louis Browns as one of his coaches."

        "text": "John James McCloskey (April 4, 1862 – November 17, 1940) was a professional baseball player and manager. As a player, he appeared in minor league games between 1887 and 1905. He also served as a minor league manager between 1888 and 1932. He is best remembered for managing in the major leagues, with the Louisville Colonels during 1895–1896 and St. Louis Cardinals during 1906–1908, while compiling one of the worst managerial records (in terms of winning percentage) in major league history.\nBiography.\nAs a player, McCloskey was primarily an outfielder and first baseman; it is unknown if he batted and threw right-handed or left-handed. He played at least 17 seasons for minor league and independent teams between 1887 and 1905; he did not play in the major leagues. Records from this era, especially in the minor leagues, are often incomplete. Within available records, his best offensive performance was in 1890 with the Houston Mudcats of the Texas League, when he batted .340 and had 18 stolen bases in 38 games. He appeared in at least 440 professional games.\nAs a manager, McCloskey was active for 36 seasons, between 1888 and 1932 with several gaps. Most of those years were spent managing minor league teams; he first managed in 1888 with the San Antonio Missionaries of the Texas-Southern League, and last managed in 1932 with the Akron Tyrites / Canton Terriers of the Central League. Through 1905, he was often a player-manager. Records for the minor league teams he managed are largely incomplete. At the time of his death, the Associated Press wrote that he managed 47 teams during his career.\nMcCloskey first managed in the major leagues with the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) during 1895 and part of 1896. In 1895, the Colonels went 35–96, finishing last of 12 NL teams. McCloskey managed the Colonels for their first 19 games of the 1896 season, winning only twice; he was succeeded by Bill McGunnigle.\nMcCloskey's second stint as a major league manager came with the St. Louis Cardinals, also of the National League, for the 1906–1908 seasons. The Cardinals' best finished under McCloskey was seventh place, and his three St. Louis teams were a combined 153–304.\nBetween the Colonels and the Cardinals, teams under McCloskey went a combined 190–417 for a winning percentage. McCloskey's managerial winning percentage is the second-worst in major league history, with only Doc Prothro lower (138–320, ).\nNicknamed \"Honest John\", McCloskey was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1862; he died there in 1940 and was interred there. McCloskey was inducted to the Texas League Hall of Fame in 2004."

He also oversaw the match in which Kirk Stevens compiled a maximum 147 break at the 1984 Wembley Masters.\nBiography.\nBorn in Dublin on 28 May 1928, Smyth moved to England when he was 21 and worked as a London Underground driver, becoming Piccadilly line snooker champion six times. He started refereeing in 1967, and first officiated a match involving a professional snooker player at the 1973 Norwich Union Open, which was Sid Hood's 4–0 defeat of Jackie Rea. He became a full-time referee in 1978. \nHe retired from the circuit in 1996.

John Street, John Williams, and myself, got more and more work as the circuit grew. In the end, my employers saw more of me on TV than they did at work. People told me it was daft to give up the Tube, and that I'd never earn a living from snooker. They said it would never last on TV, but they were wrong.\"\nIn 1977, Smyth was instrumental in the formation of the Professional Referees' Association, and was PRA president at the time of his death in 2007. He died of cancer at the age of 78 on 4 January 2007 at his home in Chesterfield."

        "text": "Steve Williams (born 29 July 1958) is an Australian former state and national representative rugby union player who captained the Wallabies in five Test matches in 1985.\nEarly life and sporting promise.\nA grazier's son, born in Narromine in far-western New South Wales, Williams was sent to boarding school at St Joseph's College in Sydney where his large frame and athletic promise was nurtured at the Joey's rugby nursery. He excelled as a schoolboy sportsman. He rowed in the First VIII for three years, won the GPS Schools Shot Put Championship in the Open division two years, played in the school's First XV for two years and was selected in the Australian Schoolboy's XV (1975 and 1976).\nClub rugby.\nHe joined the Drummoyne Rugby Club from school but later moved to the Manly club and was there in 1983 when Alan Jones took over as coach. He captained this Manly team in 1983 to win the final. Jones was the new Australian coach from 1984 and he saw the value that Williams brought to the national pack in his line-out jumping, his surprising pace and fearless scrummaging. Jones also saw Williams' leadership potential.\nRepresentative rugby career and leadership style.\nWilliams debuted for Australia against Fiji in the 1980 three match tour. He played in all matches including Australia's 22–9 Test victory. That year he also appeared for New South Wales Waratahs against the touring All Blacks and then was selected for the Wallabies in the first and second Tests of that year's Bledisloe Cup series. He suffered a broken jaw in the 2nd Test after starting a fracas with New Zealand's Mark Shaw and was out for the 3rd Test.\nHe made four appearances in 1981 against the touring French side – for Sydney, New South Wales and in both Tests. He was then selected for the 1981–82 tour of the British Isles but the first choice second-rowers were skipper Tony Shaw, and Peter McLean and Williams generally played in the minor matches other than the Test against England.\nIn 1982 Williams toured to New Zealand in the squad led by Mark Ella and played in eight matches including all three Tests against the All Blacks. In 1983 he represented against the United States, Argentina and New Zealand and made the European tour squad, playing late that year in Tests against France and Italy.\n1984 was a golden year for Australian rugby and Williams played a prominent role. Three Tests were played at home against New Zealand where he formed a new second-row partnership with another giant name Steven – Steve Cutler. The team gained toughness and finessed its combinations in August before heading to the British Isles under captain Andrew Slack for the 1984 Grand Slam tour. Jones valued Williams' quiet lead-by-example ethic, his work ethic and the hard edge he brought to the pack especially in his ability to protect the young line-out star Cutler. Jones made Williams the forward leader and squad vice-captain.\nSteve Williams proudly debuted as captain of the Wallabies in the first tour match against London Division and in another later mid-week game. He led the pack in all four Tests and was instrumental in the famous push-over try against Wales at Cardiff Arms which marked the coming of age of Australian forward play, an indication that the Wallabies could finally field a world-class pack. Howell quotes Mark Ella\" \"When Alan Jones made Steve the senior forward, it was the best thing that could have happened. He took the responsibility and really drove the forwards. I must say Steve's lineout ability surprised me. Some of his jumping was sensational, particularly in the Irish test. It enabled us to take pressure off Steve Cutler by being able to throw to 2,4 or 6. To Williams up front, Cutler in the middle or Steve Tuynman at the back. Our lineout was complete.\"\"\nThe Grand Slam victory by the 1984 squad was the first ever for an Australian team. A number of the senior players retired at tour's end and some of the stars took a year off. Williams however played on enabling him a distinguished 1985. He captained the Wallabies in five Tests that year – victories in two match series against both Canada and Fiji before a 9–10 loss against New Zealand. He retired at the top, as his country's captain having played 56 matches for Australia, having made five Wallaby tours, with a then record for a second-rower of 28 Test appearances."

The game was won by the National League 5–3.\nFrom 1959 to 1962, baseball experimented with a pair of All-Star Games per year. That ended with this 1963 game, which also marked the 30th anniversary of the inaugural All-Star Game played in Chicago in 1933.\nScoring summary.\nThe teams traded runs in the second inning. Willie Mays drew a walk off Ken McBride, stole second and scored on a Dick Groat single. The AL tied the score when Jim O'Toole gave up a Leon Wagner single, hit Zoilo Versalles with a pitch and surrendered an RBI hit to his pitching counterpart, McBride.\nIn the third, both sides scored twice. Behind 3-1, the AL struck back on a double by Albie Pearson and singles by Frank Malzone and Earl Battey to tie it at 3-all.\nThe NL scratched out a run off Jim Bunning in the fifth to regain the lead, then made it 5-3 in the eighth when Bill White singled off Dick Radatz, stole second and scored on a Ron Santo single.

The final was entirely made up of Japanese and American swimmers, three each; Japan took the top two places as Tatsugo Kawaishi earned silver. The top American, Albert Schwartz, earned bronze. While the American win streak had ended at five, the nation's podium streak ran to seven Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the seven finalists from 1928 returned: silver medalist István Bárány of Hungary and sixth-place finisher Walter Spence of Canada. Two-time gold medalist Johnny Weissmuller of the United States had retired to focus on his acting career; Tarzan the Ape Man was released earlier in 1932. The American swimming team remained strong. Japan, however, also had an impressive team, led by 15-year-old Yasuji Miyazaki.\nThe Philippines made its debut in the event. The United States made its eighth appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition used a three-round (quarterfinals, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule was a modification of the one used since 1912, allowing the top swimmers in each race plus one or more wild cards to advance. For this event, the top two in each preliminary heat plus the fastest third-place swimmer would advance to the semifinals; the top three in each semifinal would move on to the final. There were 4 heats of between 5 and 6 swimmers, allowing 9 swimmers to advance to the semifinals. The 2 semifinals had 4 or 5 swimmers each; 6 advanced to the final.\nEach race involved two lengths of the 50-metre pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nSaturday August 6, 1932: In the first semifinal Yasuji Miyazaki set a new Olympic record with 58.0 seconds.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe fastest two in each heat and the fastest third-placed from across the heats advanced to the final.\nSemifinals.\nThe fastest three in each semi-final advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nSunday August 7, 1932:"

Lewis was one of 8 new Welsh caps on the day, and the relative inexperienced team, under the captaincy of Rowe Harding, drew 3-3 with the England team. Lewis was dropped for the rest of the tournament, but was back in 1927, again against England, but this time at Twickenham. Wales lost the match 11-9, though the team played with only 14 men for most of the match, when Newports Dai Jones was injured in the first quarter of an hour. Lewis's last game was for Ossie Male's team against Scotland, again in the 1927 Five Nations Championship.

He was awarded eight caps for Wales and faced the touring with South Africans. Jones was one of the 'Terrible Eight' who clashed with the Irish forwards during the 1914 Five Nations Championship.\nRugby career.\nJones played for several rugby clubs but was selected for Welsh international duty while with Newport and Pontypool. His first cap was against the 1912 touring South Africans and although Wales lost the game, he was reselected a few months later to face England in the 1913 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Tommy Vile, Wales lost on home soil for the first time against England since 1895. The selectors kept faith with Jones, and played in two of the next three games of the tournament, which saw wins for Wales and Jones against Scotland and France.\nIn 1914, Jones was selected to play in all four matches of that year's Championship. Wales only lost one game, narrowly against eventually Grand Slam champions England. Jones was best known during this campaign for the buildup to the match against Ireland. The match was to be played at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on 14 March, and the Welsh team had travelled out to Ireland the day before. Jones and fellow Newport team mate Harry Uzzell decided to visit a local theatre in the night before the match. There they were met by some of the Irish players, where they were approached by Ireland's William Tyrrell, later to become Air Vice Marshal Sir William Tyrell, Surgeon to George VI, who challenged Jones to a physical contest on the pitch the next day. What appeared to start as good natured banter turned into a full-blooded contest during the match. Jones took several early knocks, not just from Tyrrell but from other members of the Irish pack. At half time Uzzell decided to pay the Irish back and the game descended into running fist fights and the match is remembered as being one of the most violent in international rugby. The Welsh forwards were dubbed the 'Terrible Eight' by the press after the event.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

After his playing days ended, Floyd became a manager in Minor league baseball, and spent the next 30 years coaching. In and , he was a major league coach with the New York Mets.\nEarly years.\nOn top of playing shortstop for the Southern California champion El Segundo High School baseball team, Floyd also quarterbacked El Segundo's football team his senior year. After two years at UCLA on a baseball scholarship, Floyd signed with the Baltimore Orioles as an amateur free agent in August .\nOver five seasons in the Orioles' farm system, Floyd batted .259 with nineteen home runs and 252 runs batted in. He received his first call up to the majors in September . He went 1-for-9 (a double) with an RBI on a sacrifice fly.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nThough he spent most of his minor league career at shortstop, Floyd made the Orioles' opening day roster as a back-up infielder, receiving playing time at second and third as well. Floyd batted .219 with seven runs and just one RBI, also coming on a sac fly.\nThe Orioles won a franchise best 109 games to capture the American League East by nineteen games over the Detroit Tigers. While Floyd was on the post season roster, he did not appear in the 1969 American League Championship Series or the 1969 World Series.\nThe 1970 Orioles' bullpen struggled early in the season. With Gold glover Mark Belanger firmly entrenched at short, the Orioles had little use for a light hitting middle infielder. Floyd was traded from the Orioles to the Kansas City Royals for Moe Drabowsky before the trade deadline on June 15, .\nKansas City Royals.\nFloyd went 0-for-10 in a brief trial before being demoted to the Triple-A Omaha Royals. Before the demotion, he collected his first RBI of the season on a ground out.\nHe batted .292 with two home runs and 32 RBIs at Omaha to earn a return to the majors that September. In his first game back, Floyd got his first two hits of the season, and had a three-RBI game against the Chicago White Sox. The next day, he went 3-for-7 in a doubleheader with the ChiSox. His sixth inning single off Wilbur Wood in the second game drove in the tying and winning runs.\nFloyd remained the club's regular shortstop over the remainder of the season. Albeit, with just eleven games left. In this short trial, Floyd batted .424 with eight RBIs and four runs scored.\nDuring the off season, the Royals traded incumbent shortstop Jackie Hernandez to the Pittsburgh Pirates in a six player deal that netted the Royals shortstop Freddie Patek, whom they intended to use as their everyday shortstop. Floyd began the season in Omaha, but received a call to the majors in late June. He batted .118 Through July, and was optioned back down. He again received a call up when rosters expanded in September, but batted only .163.\nA stomach disorder suffered by Patek in spring training landed Floyd starting shortstop duties to start the season. In nine games, Floyd batted .138 with two RBIs and one run scored, and committed two errors in 39 chances on the field. Once Patek was ready to return, Floyd was demoted to Omaha. He came back up in late June, and batted .190 with three RBIs and eight runs over the rest of the season.\nManagerial career.\nAfter his playing days ended, Floyd became a manager in minor league baseball, and spent the next 30 years coaching."

The Duquesne team then played in the first season of the WPHL at the Schenley Park Casino, with three other teams, the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, a club from Western University of Pennsylvania (the University of Pittsburgh today) and a team known as Pittsburgh, or the 'Casino' team. The league played twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday nights. The DC&amp;AC and the WPHL continued play until December 16, when the Casino rink was destroyed by fire. The Duquesne team finished the shortened season of league play with a 2–3 record.\nThe league and the DC&amp;AC resumed play in 1898, with its games moved to the new ice rink at the Duquesne Garden, with league members the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Western University. Many of the team's players came from Canada, with the Pittsburgh-based club owners luring players to the area with the promise of high paying jobs and a living stipend.\nBy early 1901, the broader DC&amp;AC organization, which had been active in multiple sports and fielded a professional football team of national repute, was in financial ruin and lost its clubhouse to foreclosure.

He was drafted by the Cowboys in the first round of the 1972 NFL Draft. He played college football at Boston College.\nEarly years.\nThomas attended Peekskill High School, before accepting a football scholarship from Boston College. In April 1970, he dislocated his left shoulder playing basketball, so he had to wear a harness during the football season, until he was forced to have surgery and miss one game. In 1971, he helped the school achieve their best record (9-2) in a season since 1954, while posting 119 carries for 598 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nHis versatility running and blocking was valued by the team, so he spent his playing time between the halfback and fullback positions. Fighting through injuries for most of his college career, he recorded a total of 931 career rushing yards (4.5-yard average), 2 touchdowns and was never the leading rusher on his team. He also lettered in track and ran the 200 metres.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nComing off their Super Bowl VI win, the Dallas Cowboys entered the 1972 NFL Draft worried about the future of Duane Thomas and the injury history of Calvin Hill, so they focused on their running back depth. With their first round draft choice the team selected Thomas, who was ranked sixth overall on their draft board and with their second draft choice they selected Robert Newhouse.\nHe never fully recovered from the left shoulder injury he suffered in college and re-injured it during a dummy blocking drill in training camp. He went through surgery to repair the staple pin that was used to secure the shoulder in the original operation and was placed on injured reserve. He was activated for the eighth game of the 1972 season, touching the ball only twice as a rookie during kickoff returns.\nOn September 28, 1973, he was waived due to his lack of progress and his injury history and to make room for running back Cyril Pinder.\nHouston Oilers.\nOn October 1, 1973, the Houston Oilers claimed him off waivers and played a reserve role during the season. On August 16, 1974, he was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for a seventh-round draft choice (#162-Mike Biehle).\nKansas City Chiefs.\nIn 1974, he experienced some success playing special teams for the Kansas City Chiefs, returning 25 kickoffs for 571 yards.

Julius Boros, age 48, won the third of his three major titles, one stroke ahead of runners-up Bob Charles and Arnold Palmer. Boros was the oldest winner of a major championship for over a half century, until Phil Mickelson won in the PGA Championship in 2021 at age fifty. The tournament was played in very hot conditions. Palmer had an putt to tie on the 72nd green, but it missed on the high side of the hole. It was the second of his three runner-up finishes at the only major he never won; he also tied for second in 1964 and 1970.\nThis was the final major before the formation of the Tournament Players Division, later renamed the PGA Tour. The tour pros broke away from the PGA of America in August and formed an independent tour, the American Professional Golfers, Inc. (APG). A compromise was reached in December which brought the tournament players back to the PGA in a separate division with its own policy board and commissioner.\nIn his seventh PGA Championship, Jack Nicklaus missed his first cut in the event by a stroke; five of his six previous finishes were in the top three, with a victory in 1963 in Dallas. He made the next nine cuts at the PGA Championship and won four more times (1971, 1973, 1975, 1980).\nThis PGA Championship was played immediately after the Open Championship in Scotland, the fifth time during the 1960s which the final two majors were played in consecutive weeks.

It was held October 10–14 at Siwanoy Country Club in Eastchester, New York, just north of New York City \nin \nJim Barnes defeated Jock Hutchison by 1 hole in the 36-hole final, holing a 4-foot putt at the final hole.\nFormat.\nThe format of the event closely followed that of the News of the World Match Play tournament which had been organized by the British PGA since 1903, although it had not been played since 1913 because of World War I. The main difference was that the tournament was played over 5 days with all matches contested over 36 holes, whereas matches in the News of the World Match Play were over 18 holes except for the final, the event being completed in 3 days.\nThe field of 32 golfers qualified through sectional tournaments. They competed in 36-hole match play rounds from October 10 to 14 in a single-elimination tournament, the draw being made on October 6. Extra holes were played in the event of a tied match.\nQualification.\nEntry was restricted to members of the PGA of America. Qualification was by a series of 36-hole stroke-play competitions; one for each of the seven PGA sections. The number of qualifiers in each event was proportional to the number of members of that section. The Metropolitan section had 12 qualifiers, the Middle West section 7, the Southeast section 5, the New England section 3, the Central section 2, the North and Southwest section 2, and the Pacific section 1. In the event of a tie for places there was a playoff.\nQualifying events:\nFollowing the completion of qualifying one of the two qualifiers from the North and Southwest section withdrew. An extra place was allocated to the Metropolitan section. A playoff was arranged on October 4 at Englewood Golf Club between Jack Dowling, Clarence Hackney and Macdonald Smith who had tied for 13th place in the qualifying event on September 29. Smith arrived too late to play and Dowling beat Hackney by a score of 147 to 165 over 36 holes.\nThe qualifiers were:\nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nTwo of the 32 qualifiers did not attend: Fred Clarkson from Kansas City and Mike Shearman from Sioux City. Their opponents received a bye to the second round. One of the surprises was the 6 and 5 victory of George McLean over Tom McNamara, runner-up in the 1915 U.S. Open. Wilfrid Reid lost by 1 hole to J. J. O'Brien, the only match that went to the final hole.\nSecond round.\nThe biggest surprise of the round was the defeat of Mike Brady by Willie Macfarlane. Macfarlane led by one hole after the first round but the match was level after 27 holes. Brady took the lead at the 10th hole but Macfarlane then had five threes in the next six holes and won the match 3 and 2.\nIn the lower half of the draw, Bob MacDonald led Walter Hagen by two holes after the morning round but Hagen played better in the afternoon and won 3 and 2. Jock Hutchison had a comfortable 11 and 9 win against William Brown.\nQuarter-final.\nJim Barnes beat Tom Kerrigan, the local professional, 3 and 1. The match was level at lunchtime but Barnes then won the 2nd and 5th and was 2 up after 9 holes in the afternoon. Kerrigan won the 11th but Barnes won the next to lead by 2 again. Barnes won the match with a birdie 3 at the 17th hole. Willie Macfarlane beat Jack Dowling 2 and 1. Macfarlane led by 3 holes in the morning but Dowling had levelled the match by the 10th hole of the afternoon round. Macfarlane won the 13th with a birdie 2 and the 16th with a 3, winning the match by halving the 17th.\nWalter Hagen beat J. J. O'Brien 10 and 9. Hagen took an early 2 hole lead but O'Brien levelled the match at the 7th. Hagen then won 9 of the next 11 holes to be 9 up after the morning round. In the last match Jock Hutchison beat Cyril Walker 4 and 3. Hutchison was 2 up after the first round and was dormie 5 after 13 holes of the afternoon. Walker won the 14th but a half at the 15th gave the match of Hutchison.\nSemi-final.\nThe semi-finals saw the defeat of the last two remaining qualifiers from the Metropolitican section, Willie Macfarlane and Walter Hagen.\nJim Barnes met Willie Macfarlane in the first semi-final. Barnes took an early lead and was 3 up after 5 holes. Macfarlane won the next two holes but Barnes extended the lead to 4 holes at the end of the morning round. Barnes then won the first two holes in the afternoon, to lead by 6 holes and he eventually won the match 6 and 5.\nJock Hutchison and Walter Hagen met in the other semi-final. Hutchison took an early lead, being two up after 9 holes. Hagen won the 10th, 11th and 13th and led by one hole after the first round. Hagen was still one up after 11 holes in the afternoon but played poorly at the 12th and 13th, Hutchison taking the lead in the match. Hagen made a birdie 3 at the 14th hole to level the match but lost the 16th after a bogey 5. At the 17th Hagen had a putt to level the match but missed it. Needing to win the final hole Hagen put his second shot into a ditch and later conceded the hole.\nFinal.\nIn the Saturday final, Jim Barnes defeated Jock Hutchison by 1 hole to be the first holder of the Wanamaker trophy. He also won $500 and a diamond studded gold medal. Barnes and Hutchison had both qualified through the Southeast section where they had tied for the leading score. On that occasion Hutchison had beaten Barnes in a 9-hole playoff to decide the winner. Barnes was the professional at Whitemarsh Valley Country Club, north of Philadelphia while Hutchison represented Allegheny Country Club, northwest of Pittsburgh.\nHutchison made a good start to the final, being 4 up after 8 holes. He had won the 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 8th holes and taken just 31 strokes for the first eight holes. Hutchison then went over the green at the 9th, losing to a par 4. Barnes also won the 13th and 15th and was only 1 hole down after the morning round.\nIn the afternoon Barnes levelled the match with a par 3 at the 3rd hole and took the lead for the first time with a birdie 3 at the 7th hole. The 9th hole was halved with both players making birdie 3s but Barnes went two up with another birdie at the 10th hole. Hutchison won the 11th hole after Barnes missed a short putt, his first winning hole since the 8th of the morning round. Hutchison then won the 13th hole with a par 3 to level the match and went ahead again at the 15th after another bogey from Barnes. The 16th was halved but Hutchison found a bunker at the 17th, made a bogey 5, and the match was all square. Both players struggled on the par-5 18th and each was about four feet from the hole after four strokes. A measurement was needed to determine who putted first and Barnes was an inch closer. Hutchison missed his putt but Barnes holed his, to win the match.\nResults.\nw/o = won by walkover\nPrize money.\nThe winner received $500 and a diamond medal, the runner-up $250 and a gold medal, the losing semi-finalists $125 and a silver medal, while the losing quarter-finalists received $75, second round losers $60 and first round losers $50, making a total prize fund of $2,580."

        "text": "The 2008 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 25th edition of the premier event of the North American Thoroughbred horse racing year. It took place on October 24 and 25 during the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The 2008 Breeders' Cup results were influential in the Eclipse Award divisional championship voting.\nThe Friday racecard featured five Breeders' Cup races for fillies and mares, culminating in Zenyatta's win in the Ladies Classic. On Saturday, the European contingent won five races, capped by an upset by English-based Raven's Pass over heavy favorite Curlin in the Classic.\nLead-up.\nSanta Anita racetrack hosted the Breeders' Cup for the fourth time in 2008. It was the first time that the event had been held on a synthetic dirt surface instead of natural dirt, as Santa Anita had changed to a Pro Ride surface in 2007 in response to a state mandate aimed at increasing the safety of the sport for both horses and jockeys. The change was of concern to both horsemen and bettors as it was difficult to predict which horses would respond well to the new surface and which would struggle. However, the change was expected to increase interest from European trainers, many of whom had access to similar all weather tracks.\nFor the second year in a row, three races were added to the Breeders' Cup roster, bringing the total up to 14. In 2007, the Dirt Mile, Juvenile Turf and Filly &amp; Mare Sprint had been added while in 2008, the Marathon, Juvenile Fillies Turf and Turf Sprint were added. The new races were intended to help fill out the Friday card and increase the range of options available to horsemen, particularly those from overseas. By rule, the new races could not be graded until their third renewal.\nBreeders' Cup officials decided to rearrange the racecards so that all five races for fillies and mares were held on Friday. \"By shifting some of our traditional Saturday races to Friday, we ensure that Friday stands on its own as an international competition of the highest level\", said Breeders Cup President and CEO Greg Avioli. \"This new format provides a great stage to showcase the talents of the best female Thoroughbreds in the world.\" They also renamed the Distaff as the Ladies' Classic and instituted a ban on steroids.\nBecause of the synthetic dirt surface, some horsemen from the East Coast hesitated to attend the event. In particular, Curlin, the defending Horse of the Year and winner of the 2007 Classic, did not commit to entering until after a strong workout at Santa Anita on October 14. In part because of the three new races, a record 180 horses were pre-entered, including a record 35 from Europe.\nThe Friday races were broadcast on ESPN2. The Saturday card was broadcast on ESPN and ABC. Attendance was up slightly compared to 2007, with the excellent weather being credited. The two-day handle also increased by 5.5% to $155.5 million. However, attendance on Saturday was lower than on previous renewals held at Santa Anita, with high ticket prices cited as the major cause. The Saturday on-track handle was also the lowest since 1999, which was not unexpected given the 2008 economic downturn.\nResults.\nThe highlight of the Friday card was Zenyatta's dominant win in the Ladies Classic. The four-year-old filly came into the race undefeated but was facing the best field of her career, with four Grade I winning fillies shipping in from New York alone. Zenyatta broke last and continued to trail the field for the first of a mile before beginning her drive on the far turn. She quickly made up ground while circling wide and swept to the lead down the stretch, winning comfortably by lengths. She received a standing ovation from the crowd on returning to the winner's circle.\nVentura was also a stand-out winner in the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint, winning by the largest margin of the day while finishing just 0.01 second behind the track record. Stardom Bound won the Juvenile Fillies impressively while Maram just held off Heart Shaped by a nose in the Juvenile Fillies Turf.\nIn the Classic, the favorite was Curlin, who raced near the back of the field then made his move on the turn, striking the lead at the top of the stretch. Raven's Pass and Henrythenavigator, outstanding milers from Europe, accelerated past Curlin and finished first and second respectively. Tiago closed late to finish third.\nIn the Turf, Conduit was the second favorite because of his earlier win in the St Leger. Jockey Ryan Moore placed Conduit in the middle of the pack, then released him in the stretch where he out-kicked the others. It was Moore's first win at the Breeders' Cup but he was not available for comment after the race. \"He's rushing off to the airport as he has to ride in France tomorrow,\" explained Conduit's trainer Sir Michael Stoute. \"He's a big talent with a great racing brain and you'll be hearing a lot more of him.\"\nOther highlights included the French filly Goldikova taking on male horses and winning in the Mile. Her trainer Freddie Head compared her favorably to champion Miesque, who he had ridden to victory in the Mile in 1987 and 1988. Midnight Lute won the Sprint for the second year in a row, which also gave Garrett Gomez his third win of the day and fourth over the two days – a record. Midshipman won the Juvenile to establish himself as the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby.\nAll told, European-based horses won a record five races at the Breeders' Cup: Raven's Pass in the Classic, Goldikova in the Mile, Donativum in the Juvenile Turf, Muhannak in the Marathon and Conduit in the Turf. Although this was partially credited to the artificial dirt surface, because of the increase in the number of races, it was proportional to their previous highs of three wins out of seven races in 1993 at Santa Anita and three wins in eight races in 2001 at Belmont, where they also finished second in the Classic.\nIn the 2008 Eclipse Award voting, five of the eleven flat racing categories were awarded to horses who won at the Breeders' Cup: Stardom Bound (Champion Two-Year-Old Female), Midshipman (Champion Two-Year-Old Male), Zenyatta (Champion Older Female), Conduit (Champion Male Turf Horse) and Forever Together (Champion Female Turf Horse). In addition, Curlin was voted Horse of the Year and Champion Older Male despite his fourth-place finish in the Classic.\nFemale Championship Friday.\nThe attendance was 31,257\nSource: Equibase\nSaturday: Day 2.\nSource: Equibase"

During World War II he served in the Hungarian Army between 1942 and 1943, and then returned to sport. He retired in 1959 and later worked as a water polo coach in Hungary and Egypt (1964–66). In the late 1960s he brought his club Orvosegyetem SC to winning two national titles, one Hungarian Cup, and a third place in the European Cup tournament."

        "text": "The Major League Baseball logo was designed by Jerry Dior in 1968 and was included on all on-field uniforms of Major League Baseball (MLB) employees beginning in the 1969 season.\nCreation.\nThe logo was created in a single afternoon. Contrary to popular belief, the silhouette was not modeled on Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, or any specific player but was drawn with reference to photographs of several players. The silhouette was chosen specifically because of its ambiguity: the batter could be right- or left-handed and of any ethnic background.\nThe MLB \"Batter\" logo was commissioned by the Major League Baseball Centennial Committee, and was introduced by the new Baseball Commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, to be used in preparations for, and celebration of, the 1869–1969 Professional Baseball Centennial Celebration held July 21, 1969, in Washington, DC.\nFor many years, the authorship of the logo was a matter of some dispute as two graphic designers laid claim to creating the piece: Jerry Dior (working for the marketing firm of Sandgren &amp; Murtha) and James Sherman, a comic book illustrator. In November 2008, ESPN writer Paul Lukas managed to clear the matter up and Dior's authorship is no longer in doubt. Upon closely examining the logo, Sherman declared:\nThat's not my logo, and I was totally unaware that it existed... The logo I created was very similar, but I designed it in the early 1980s. All I can say is that I was so sports-unaware that I didn't know about the earlier logo. I feel like a total idiot now that I didn't know about it. I'm flabbergasted.\nPopularity and influence.\nThe logo has not been changed in the years since its adoption, except for small variations in the shades of blue and red, and that individual teams sometimes alter the coloring to match their uniform colors. Since its adoption, the basic model of an athlete (or equipment used for the sport) in silhouette flanked by red and blue color blocks has also been incorporated in the logos of the National Basketball Association (with Jerry West as its player model), Minor League Baseball, Women's National Basketball Association, Arena Football League, U.S. Figure Skating, Hockey Canada, American Hockey League, PGA Tour, National Lacrosse League, Indy Racing League, and Major League Gaming. It has also been parodied in Major League Eating.\nAlan Siegel, who oversaw Dior's logo, deliberately based his NBA logo design off MLB's in 1969 because NBA Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy wanted a family relationship between the sports seen as being All-American."

        "text": "Steven Hill (born November 14, 1985) is an American former professional basketball player. A center, he attended University of Arkansas.\nCollege career.\nIn his freshman year, Hill started 18 of 30 games for the Arkansas Razorbacks and finished second in the Southeastern Conference with 1.8 blocks per game, also averaging 2.3 points and rebounds. The number of blocks achieved, 54, was second most for a freshman in Arkansas history, the leader being Oliver Miller with 60.\nIn his second year, Hill upped his numbers slightly, averaging 2.8 blocks in the process, good enough for second in the conference. His 91 blocks as a sophomore surpassed Miller's record of 85.\nHill received SEC Defensive Player of the Year accolades in his junior year, and improved his averages once again (6.2 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.8 blocks), while his 93 made shots and 218 total points doubled his career totals entering the year. In blocked shots, Hill's total of 99 made him the first Razorback to get 90+ blocks in more than one year. In his senior year, his numbers decreased slightly.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2008 NBA draft, Hill was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers in August 2008, but was waived in October, before the 2008–09 season began.\nHe was signed by the Oklahoma City Thunder on November 4, 2008, playing one game before being assigned to the Thunder's D-League affiliate Tulsa 66ers on November 21. On December 13, Hill was recalled by the Thunder, after averaging 9.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.8 blocks in 25.6 minutes in five games for the 66ers. A week later, without playing an additional game, he was made expendable and subsequently waived by the Thunder to make room on their roster for newly signed 7'0\" center Nenad Krstic.\nHe played with the Minnesota Timberwolves during the NBA 2009 Summer League and with the Sacramento Kings during the NBA 2010 Summer League.\nIn October 2010, Hill signed a training camp contract with the Portland Trail Blazers, but was waived prior to the regular season."

The women's team play in the Campeonato Nacional, the first tier, but recent changes in the competition mean they only compete in Sevens.\nBenfica currently hold home games at the Lisbon University Stadium, while their youth teams play at the Pupilos do Exército, near Colégio Militar in Lisbon. Benfica hoped to secure a rugby field in Oeiras, in a 20-year rental, but the project never materialized. It was supposed to have a grass field capable of international matches, plus two synthetic fields for youth development, three football fields for Under-12, a 2,000 people stand and additional logistical support.\nBenfica once had a Portuguese international in their team, Diogo Gama, who represented Portugal at the 2007 World Cup.\nHonours.\nAccording to Benfica's official website\nCurrent squad.\nAccording to Benfica's official website and Portuguese Rugby Federation"

        "text": "Chris Smith (born March 31, 1939) is a former American college basketball player for the Virginia Tech Hokies from 1957 to 1961. He was nicknamed \"Moose\" at Charleston High School in West Virginia where he played as a 6-foot-6 center. During an era of exceptional local talent, in what was then known as the Kanawha Valley, Smith was later dubbed \"The Human Pogo Stick\" by former Roanoke sportswriter Bill Brill. \nRefusal of the 1961 NBA draft.\nDuring the 1961 NBA draft, Smith was the highest draft choice for any Virginia Tech basketball player ever when he was selected as the fourteenth overall choice by the NBA's Syracuse Nationals.\nSince playing professional basketball was not financially lucrative in 1961, Smith reportedly informed the NBA teams that he would not play professional basketball and asked them not to draft him. He never reported to Syracuse camp. \nAwards and records.\nIn 1982, Smith was inducted as a charter member to Virginia Tech's Hall-of-Fame. He was the only basketball player in the class. \nSmith still holds many Virginia Tech rebounding records: game (36); season (495); career (1508); season per-game average (20.4); and career per-game average (17.1). \nSmith is the state of Virginia's NCAA Division I leader in career average rebounds per game of all time.\nHe is still ranked 26th nationally for career average rebounds per game (17.1) and 24th nationally for total career rebounds (1508) as listed all-time for Division I players by the Official 2008 NCAA Men's Basketball Records Book. His career average rebound record of 17.1 rebounds per game is the current record for the State of Virginia. \nIn addition, Smith has the Southern Conference tournament rebounding records of 28 rebounds for a single game and 71 rebounds for three games. These records were established in 1960 and have been the Southern Conference tournament rebounding records for more than 50 years.\nReputation and coverage.\nAccording to the 2009–10 Virginia Tech basketball program, Smith \"is regarded by many as the greatest basketball player in school history.\" In 2010, he was chosen to represent the Hokies at the annual 2010 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament's Legends Class. In 2010, ESPN selected Chris Smith as the \"Best Player\" in the history of the Virginia Tech Basketball program. \nIn 1959, Chris Smith was a First Team All-Southern Conference Selection. In 1960, he was a unanimous 1960 First Team All-Southern Conference Selection along with Jerry West. In 1961, Smith was the captain of the All-Southern Conference team. In 1960, he was selected as a Converse Second Team All-American.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" featured the Virginia Tech basketball team on December 26, 1960. That issue stated the following: Clearly the best performer on the floor was Tech's 6-foot-6 center Chris Smith, who scored 24 points and had 21 rebounds. The next night he led Tech to an 81-54 victory over Baylor and was chosen as the Classic's most valuable player. He is a square-jawed, crew-cut battler whose sheer strength and spring will surely bring him All-American honors this year. \nFrequent news articles still appear that document events during Smith's playing career such as Jennings Culley's July 22, 2001 article in the Richmond Times titled \"Tech Basketball Recruits said 'Noe' to West Virginia\"; Jack Bogaczyk's February 25, 2009 article about the second college basketball game in the Charleston Civic Center between Marshall and Virginia Tech; and MSN Sports November 16, 2008 article about Chuck Noe's successful basketball recruiting in West Virginia for Virginia Tech during the 1950s."

It moved to Arlington and reopened in early 2010. In 2012, the WBW was merged with the International Bowling Media Association. After the merger, the WBW Hall of Fame inductees became part of the IBMA Luby Hall of Fame.\nCriteria for election.\nWBW Hall of Famers are chosen strictly in the basis of athletic performance, to even qualify for consideration, a player must be an amateur and accumulate a minimum of 15 points in any combination of four specifically designated international competitions;\nwith gold medals occurring in an event other than five-person team. Five points are credited for a gold medal, three points for silver, and one for bronze.\nEach summer, the WBW Administrator scans a database to determine eligible candidates and sends ballots with those players’ names and resumes to current officers of the World Bowling Writers, which formed the Hall’s Board.\nElection process.\nThere are two categories: “Men” and “Women.” Voters can cast one vote in each category for every three names listed there, and one vote for any group of “leftovers” names in each category that totals less than three. The man and woman who receive the most votes are elected.\nIn the case of ties, more than one man or one woman can be elected, provided that each candidate in the tie receives at least two-thirds of the total votes cast in that category that year. If that standard is not met, no one is elected in that category that year."

        "text": "The Newbridge Boxing Club is a boxing gym operated by Enzo Calzaghe and based in Newbridge (Tre Celyn) in South Wales. The club has been one of the most successful of recent years, at one point in 2007 boasting three genuine world champions in Joe Calzaghe (WBO super-middleweight), Enzo Maccarinelli (WBO cruiserweight) and Gavin Rees (WBA light welterweight) . Other fighters of note who have won belts at the club include former Commonwealth light middleweight champion Bradley Pryce and former WBU champion and world title challenger Gary Lockett who retired in Sept 2008.\nThe clubhouse.\nThe club itself is in its second generation, as the original clubhouse, deemed unsafe by the local council, was demolished in 2002. Following the demolition, Joe and his father Enzo bought another clubhouse just a mile away in Cwmcarn and set about transforming an old rugby club into a boxing gym. \nThe club is situated near an industrial park next to a rugby pitch and reached by a set of wooden steps on which the boxers use to train. The sign greeting people is hand painted and trash dots the weedy yard. This impression of the club does not meet expectations when people think about it being the training HQ for a World champion. According to a reporter from the LA Times who visited the clubhouse prior to Joe's clash with Bernard Hopkins, \"in places, it’s just a few notches north of squalid\". One reporter during the same press trip is alleged to have spotted a dead mouse floating in a sink.\nDespite appearances Joe Calzaghe has described the place as feeling \"like a palace\" compared with the previous gym which had a ring made out of carpet and held up by broom handles. Prior to the move to the new clubhouse boxers had trained for years in what Joe describes as \"the mangiest little building you could possibly imagine\" with no heating, no showers, bad toilets and buckets to trap the rain.\nWorld champions.\nNotwithstanding its seemingly unglamorous reputation, the Newbridge Boxing Club has produced some of Britain's best boxers, most notably the former WBO super middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe whose victories over Jeff Lacy, Mikkel Kessler, Bernard Hopkins and Roy Jones, Jr were all achieved by training in Newbridge. Joe's friend Enzo Maccarinelli won his WBO cruiserweight title whilst training there, and defended against challenger Wayne Braithwaite before being stopped by David Haye. Light-welterweight Gavin Rees shocked the world when he beat Frenchman Souleymane M'baye to win the WBA title before losing it to Andreas Kotelnik. Middleweight Gary Lockett held the lightly regarded WBU belt but achieved fame when he unsuccessfully challenged world number one Kelly Pavlik in Atlantic City for the undisputed middleweight crown. Two time World Light-Heavyweight champion Nathan Cleverly trained at the club as an amateur and during the first three years of his professional career but left in 2008.\nThe Newbridge Boxing Club, considering its location in such a small town, has had a disproportionate influence on the global boxing scene."

He graduated to AAA hockey for the Chatham-Kent Cyclones of the Pavilion League before playing one season with the Blenheim Blades Jr C team and two seasons with the Chatham Maroons Jr.B. hockey club of the OHA.\nJones was selected by the Minnesota Wild in the fourth round of the 2004 NHL Entry Draft after his second season with the Maroons.\nJones earned a scholarship to play in the NCAA at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, spending four years with the RedHawks men's ice hockey program in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA).\nProfessional.\nJones made his NHL debut with the Nashville Predators in the 2008–09 season opener. He scored his first career NHL goal on October 15 against goaltender Marty Turco of the Dallas Stars.\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Jones was placed on waivers by the Predators and was subsequently claimed by the Edmonton Oilers on March 3, 2010.\nJones has affectionately been given the nickname \"Junkman\" by many of his fans, partly due to his propensity for so-called \"garbage goals\" and partly because he shares the same last name as former Major League Baseball pitcher Randy \"Junkman\" Jones.\nOn December 2, 2011, Jones scored his first career NHL hat-trick, scoring three third period goals in a 6–3 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nAfter four seasons with the Oilers, Jones opted to explore free agency before later re-signing with Edmonton on a one-year contract on July 6, 2013.\nOn October 9, 2014, as an unrestricted free agent entering the 2014–15 season, Jones signed a professional try-out contract with the Utica Comets of the American Hockey League (AHL), the top minor league affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks.\n After just five games with the Comets, in which he added one assist, Jones was released from his try-out. On November 17, he then signed his first contract abroad, joining German Kölner Haie in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) for the remainder of the playing season. On February 19, 2015, the Kölner Haie and Jones agreed on a two-year contract extension lasting until 2017.\nAfter playing in his fifth season with Kölner Haie, following a semi-final defeat in the 2018–19 season, Jones announced his retirement from professional hockey after 12 seasons."

        "title": "The Boxing Lesson",
        "text": "The Boxing Lesson is a rock band from Austin, Texas. A power trio with synthesizers performing the bass player's role, they create a mammoth psychedelic 'wall of sound' that begins minimally and builds into grand orchestrations. Vocalist and guitarist Paul Waclawsky and synthesizer player Jaylinn Davidson combine strong songwriting with desert rock, guitar freak-outs, soul space jams and plenty of Texas rock ’n’ roll thunder. \nThe Boxing Lesson EP.\nThe Boxing Lesson was formed in Los Angeles by Paul Waclawsky in 2002, where they recorded and released their first two EPs on their own label, Send Me Your Head Records. The first, self-titled effort gained strong local buzz and earned the band many shows supporting touring national bands. The intricate melodies of the three guitars complemented each other, with the intense volume, the multiple timbres created a rich sonic palette. The EP was described by the LA Weekly as one that \"tests your patience and then rewards it.\" Joseph Kyle from MundaneSounds wrote that, \"The promise on The Boxing Lesson is so great, that you'd probably want to hold them to their potential in a court of law.\" Some international acclaim was received as well. Noise Theory Australia gave it 5-stars, and wrote that, \"Each of the four tracks on this debut self-titled EP gracefully drift through the dark night, and with every intricate guitar melody there is a star that lights the way,\" and \"The Boxing Lesson have addressed every issue that has ever plagued atmospheric rock and mended them in what seems like a manner that seems to simple to be true.\"\nRadiation.\nThe band quickly recorded a follow up with Matt Brown and Chris Pearson at Sonikwire Studios in Irvine, CA. Expanding on the sound of the debut EP, the band incorporated classical music, more Moog synthesizers, ambient effects and a new bass player. The EP also included a woozy live version of the Acetone song, \"Don't Cry\", that was recorded at Reservoir Tip Studios by Anthony Arvizu. The track was recorded live, with all guitars and drums bleeding into each other. John Treanor and Phil Cobb recorded their guitars without using headphones; bending their battle-axes through space, their headstocks imbibing the sanguine dust in the room. Consequently, \"Radiation\", received more impressive national and international reviews, with \"Splendid Magazine\" describing it as \"promising, if imperfect\". Australian blog, Halo-17, gave the record a favorable 8.5/10 rating and said,\"If you only take a chance on one new rock album this month, make it this one,\" and \"The Boxing Lesson cut all the fat from their music, and produced a record which shows that they're a band that should be taken seriously, in addition to providing some of the best music I've heard so far in 2004.\"\nSongs in the Key of C.\nIn late 2004, Waclawsky relocated from California to Texas, where he assembled a new lineup including Jaylinn Davidson on synthesizers and Jake Mitchell on drums. Practicing and writing songs for a full year before playing live, the band recorded \"Songs in the Key of C\" with Tim Gerron at Music Lab in Austin, TX. The sound was a wild departure from the two previous EPs. The Onion's Los Angeles Calendar Section wrote, \"Gone are the laid-back vocals and gauzy guitars, replaced by passionate singing, frenzied power chords, and tons of gurgling analog synthesizers.\" The Austin Chronicle gave the release 3 stars and wrote, \"Though claiming 'Indie Rock Is Dead', the Boxing Lesson's \"Songs in the Key of C\" provides enough lo-fi life support in its tales of criminals and crackheads to stay the reaper.\" Meanwhile, Smother Magazine wrote, \"The Boxing Lesson are an indie rock band on a mission to the moon.\"\nWild Streaks &amp; Windy Days.\nAfter doing several tours promoting \"Songs in the Key of C\", the band quickly went back to Tim Gerron in 2007 to record their debut full length album. Focusing on more atmospheric textures and varied styles of songwriting, the 12-song album, \"Wild Streaks &amp; Windy Days\", took 8 months to record and was eventually self-released at SXSW 2008 to positive reviews. Barrett King of Baltimore's Sën magazine compared the sound of the album to that of other space rock acts like Pink Floyd and David Bowie, while LA Cityzine praised its \"rich lyrical offerings and strong musicianship\". The Lemur Blog in Sweden wrote, \"\"The result is spaced out, it's probably the best space rock album you can find within the scrutinized confines of 2008.\". The Music Reviewer gave the album a 9.0/10 and said, \"It's an amazing mix of the past and the present, without being too much of either. It's a group that you'll hear more of in the future, and it's a group that knows how to pay homage to – and not just copy – their idols from the past.\" Indiecision blog from India described The Boxing Lesson's sound as, \"if Failure and Pink Floyd got together to drink mushroom tea out of fancy little teacups and chase the white rabbit with Brian Eno and Robert Smith\".\nEric Power directed the music video for \"Dark Side of the Moog\" from \"Wild Streaks and Windy Days\", featuring an animated version of the band exploring an alien planet. A stop motion music video for the track \"Brighter\" was released as well. The video, directed by Victor Yiu, was constructed from over 6000 still images. Additionally, the band released a guerrilla-cam-style video for \"Dance with Meow\" shot by Matt Robertson which featured the band dressed in furry cat masks, chasing the White Rabbit, doing cat-nip and visiting local-haunts in Austin's nightlife.\nJake Mitchell.\nIn August 2008, the band's drummer, Jake Mitchell, was sentenced to five years of prison after being charged by the Austin police for \"conspiracy to manufacture marijuana\". Before Mitchell went to prison, the band went into the studio to record a number of tracks that could become the foundation of a new EP.\nOn February 14, 2009, Daytrotter posted a session recorded live in Rock Island, IL, featuring an unreleased song, \"Room 17,\" that was written as a tribute to Mitchell.\nFur State.\nOn October 26, 2010, The Boxing Lesson released \"Fur State\", a lo-fi acoustic/electronic instrumental album recorded on a 4-track by Waclawsky and Davidson in 2004. The album heavily features synthesizers and drum loops and marks a turning point in the evolution of the band. The album name is a play on words for the \"first eight\" songs recorded in Austin. Self-released on homemade cassette tapes, the album cover depicts the State of Texas in a tiger fur pattern. Some of these songs are instrumental stripped down versions of songs that appeared on \"Songs in the Key of C\" and \"Wild Streaks &amp; Windy Days\". Cassette restoration and Mastering by Danny Reisch at Good Danny's, Austin, TX.\nAn animated music video by Jeanne Hospod was released for the opening track, \"One\". It features a ghost-rodeo, space-travel, feminine beauty, psychedelic felines, art and enlightenment from the far reaches of Austin, TX. Hospod released an erotic animated video for the track \"Four\" in early 2011. The artist's description was, \"Alien woman seduces hapless human male involving a very unusual flower.\" Nathan Guy directed a non-animated cat-themed video for the track \"Three\" that was released at SXSW 2011. The director described the video as \"Morphing cats' psychedelic journey through the Fur State,\" and video blended live performance shots with warped smoky images showing the band in costume hanging at local Austin haunts.\nMuerta EP.\nThe Boxing Lesson released a collection of four slow-tempo psychedelic tracks entitled \"Muerta EP\" in the summer of 2011. These songs were recorded over several years in Austin, TX with several drummers. These four recordings chronicle the band's evolution during this time period and are an expansion of their space rock sound. Vivogig reviewer Jim Sells says, \"Well, the Boxing Lesson nails it on \"Muerta\".” Pink Floyd influences the music but there is more to their sound than a Floyd fixation. Elements of M83, the \"Northern Soul\"-period of The Verve, and the adventurousness of Ponytail all are present here. The effects-laden guitar weaves in and out of the soaring Moog parts, creating a sonic landscape that draws the listener in from the first sound. Sells goes on to note that \"\"Muerta\" has to be in my Top 10 for the year. There is just nothing like it out there.\" A double 7inch vinyl set was pressed by New Fortune Records. The \"Muerta\" music video directed by Jonathan London and animated by Will Kistler was also released. The CGI enhanced video depicts the band drowning to the depths of the sea.\nHealth is the New Drug b/w Better Daze.\n\"Health is the New Drug\" was released as a single along with b-side \"Better Daze\" in February 2012. New Fortune Records, a Detroit imprint, pressed a vinyl single. It's the first track being released from the upcoming Big Hits LP produced by Chris \"Frenchie\" Smith (Trail of Dead, Meat Puppets, Ume). The song features psychedelic guitar riffs, a wall of synthesizers, and a few words of wisdom (or caution). \"Relying on MOOG for bottom end and tons of sonic noise, the songs blend Meddle-era Floyd guitar freak-outs with M83 propulsion, Spiritualized soul space jams with Texas rock ’n’ roll thunder.\" High praise came from the Houston Press who said, \"Seriously, \"Health is the New Drug\" is the best song we've heard this year.\" An animated music video for Better Daze was released at the end of 2012. The video depicts a meteor filled with dark life forms plummeting into Earth releasing bizarre creatures on Austin, TX. Directed by Eric Power the video combines live action with cut paper shadow animation filmed on a green screen. Houston Press ranked Better Daze number 15 in their Top 25 music videos of 2012.\nBig Hits!\n\"Big Hits!\" is the first full-length album released by The Boxing Lesson in five years. It's more rock-oriented than The Boxing Lesson's past albums and is produced by Chris \"Frenchie\" Smith (...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead, The Darkness, Dandy Warhols, Ringo Deathstarr) at The Bubble in Austin, TX. \"Big Hits!\" was released at SXSW 2013 to positive reviews. The Austin Chronicle gave it 3 ½ stars and said, “Arms buried deep in galactic mud, the Boxing Lesson takes an outer space journey to the center of the Earth.” \nMaking this new album was no easy fight for the Boxing Lesson. When Paul Waclawsky and keyboardist Jaylinn Davidson began writing the band's second LP four punishing years ago, they planned to name it Possibilities. Only after enduring a long and merciless beatdown of bad luck and creative interruptions did they come to curse that title. The album was mixed by Kevin Butler at Test Tube Audio, and mastered off analog tape by Jerry Tubb at Terra Nova in Austin, TX. The results brought the project to completion, except for the album name. Utilizing a clever triple entendre, they renamed it \"Big Hits!\" and emerged with a 12th round knockout. \nMusical style.\nThe band's sound primarily is built around a psychedelic space rock ethos, with Paul Waclawsky's dark melodic guitar work using reverb, fuzz, and tape delay effects, and Jaylinn Davidson's heavy use of Moog synthesizers. The band has not had a stringed bass player since relocating to Austin, the rhythmic function of the bassline is instead performed on the synth. Haunting vocals and moody melodies are punctuated by mesmerizing guitars, droney beats and expressive electronica. The Boxing Lesson plays \"space\" rock that can transport the listener to another dimension and beyond. Culturespill blog said, \"An up-and-coming threesome out of Austin, Texas, The Boxing Lesson betray a rather thinly veiled affinity for Pink Floyd but they roughen the edges of that influence with an open-armed embrace of Spacemen 3, The Cure, Radiohead and Broken Social Scene. Craig Franklin from Halo-17 Australia wrote, \"Not enough bands make music like The Boxing Lesson any more. Over the course of three EPs, they've managed to create some truly breathtaking and epic music that draw the dots between such seemingly disparate bands as Pink Floyd, My Bloody Valentine and David Bowie. They're equally at home writing short, concise pop songs, and kicking out the jams. They use a Moog synth extensively. In short, unlike a lot of bands, they're consistently 'interesting'.\""

It was one of seven gymnastics events for men and it was contested for the fourth time after 1896, 1904, and 1924. The competition was held on Wednesday, August 8, 1928. Eighty-eight gymnasts from eleven nations competed, with each nation having a team of 8 gymnasts. The event was won by Hermann Hänggi of Switzerland, the nation's second consecutive (and third overall) victory in the pommel horse. The Swiss nearly repeated their 1924 medal sweep, with 4 of the top 5, but Finland's Heikki Savolainen took bronze between silver medalist Georges Miez and fourth-place finisher Edi Steinemann. It was Finland's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the top 10 gymnasts from 1924 returned: fifth-place finisher Giuseppe Paris of Italy, sixth-place finisher Stane Derganc of Yugoslavia, eighth-place finisher August Güttinger of Switzerland, and tenth-place finisher Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia. The reigning (1926) world champion, Jan Karafiat of Czechoslovakia, did not compete, but the second- and third-place finishers at the world championships, Jan Gajdos and Ladislav Vácha (both also of Czechoslovakia), did.\nThe Netherlands made its debut in the men's pommel horse. Hungary competed for the first time since 1896. The other nine nations had all competed in 1924. Switzerland and the United States were each making their third appearance, tied for most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nEach gymnast performed a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise. The maximum score for each exercise was 30 points. The pommel horse was one of the apparatus used in the individual and team all-around scores. It accounted for of the score."

These teams, along with the Sunday side, have enabled over 170 players to represent the club in 2019.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed in 1989, initially under the name \"Pearl 1990\", and was subsequently renamed to \"Kingstonian\" in 1995.\nGeoff Phillips, one of the founding members of Kingstonian Cricket Club, led the way in creating the new club from the former Pearl Assurance club and negotiating with Kings College to keep the team at Windsor Avenue. Although he last played for the club in 2009, he continued to be the driving force behind the club, managing finances as the Club treasurer, holding numerous club offices and liaising with Kings College to allow the club to continue to use their ground. It was Geoff's drive, energy and enthusiasm that enabled the club to expand and to join the Surrey Fullers league. For many years, Geoff gave up his Saturday and Sunday afternoons to help at the cricket ground, including preparing teas for home games, manning the bar, even providing a taxi service to get players to and from games. These efforts helped the club save thousands of pounds which enabled the club to purchase items like mobile covers, a bowling machine and a portable cage.

He plays as a scrum-half and represents Cork Constitution in the All-Ireland League.\nMunster.\nWilliams made his Munster debut against Connacht in December 2009. He made his Heineken Cup debut against London Irish in October 2010. Williams also started against Australia in Munster's historic 15–6 victory over them in November 2010. He scored his first try for Munster in their 35–12 win against Scarlets in September 2011. He signed a two-year contract extension with Munster in March 2012.\nHe started for Munster A in their 31–12 2011–12 British and Irish Cup Final win against Cross Keys on 27 April 2012. On 28 February 2014, it was announced that Williams had signed a new one-year contract with Munster, which will see him remain at the province until at least June 2015. He signed a two-year contract extension in February 2015. On 2 January 2016, Williams earned his 100th cap for Munster when he came off the bench against Ulster. On 24 January 2017, it was announced that Williams had signed a contract extension which will see him remain with Munster until June 2019.\nOn 1 April 2017, Williams was a late replacement for the injured Conor Murray in Munster's line-up for the 2016–17 European Rugby Champions Cup quarter-final against Toulouse. Munster went on to win the game 41–16 and progress to the semi-finals. Williams earned his 150th cap for Munster on 10 February 2018, doing so when he started in the provinces' 33–5 win against Zebre in the 2017–18 Pro14. Facial injuries suffered during training initially ruled Williams out for the remainder of the 2017–18 season, as surgery was required, but he made a faster-than-expected recovery and returned to full training late in April. Williams was released by Munster at the end of the 2018–19 season.\nAfter his release by Munster, Williams continued playing rugby at an amateur level for Cork Constitution. He had decided to retire from playing rugby after Con's All-Ireland League Division 1A final against Clontarf in May 2019, but after Con won the final 28–13 to secure their second AIL title in three years, Williams extended his playing career into the 2019–20 season, and he started in the 24–17 win against Young Munster in the final of the Munster Senior Cup in December 2019, a victory that secured a 30th title for the Cork side."

        "text": "Gordon Livingstone \"Gordie\" McLeod (born 7 November 1956 in Wollongong, New South Wales) is an Australian former professional basketball player and coach in the National Basketball League (NBL).\nProfessional career.\nMcLeod was already known as one of Australia's more talented point guards when the new NBL started in 1979. He joined his home town team the Illawarra Hawks for the inaugural season playing 17 games and averaging 10.1 points per game.\nMcLeod was appointed captain of the Hawks and would continue to lead the team until the end of the 1982 season. After 82 games in the red and white of Illawarra he would sign with the Sydney Supersonics for 1983. After just one season in Sydney, McLeod would re-join the Hawks from 1984, regaining the club captaincy. His return helped the Hawks make the NBL playoffs for the first time in the club's history. The team lost the Elimination Final 101–108 to the Newcastle Falcons. McLeod had a career best 15.8 points per game during the 1984 NBL season.\nThe Hawks missed the finals in 1985 but the club made it as far as the semi-finals in 1986 where they lost to eventual champions Adelaide and again in 1987 where they lost a three-game series again to the eventual league champions, the Brisbane Bullets. McLeods own form saw him score 9.1 points per game in 1986 and 12.4 points per game in 1987.\nFollowing the 1988 season, McLeod again left the Illawarra Hawks, this time joining the Hobart Devils. He would play two seasons with the struggling Devils before joining 1990 NBL grand finalist Brisbane for the 1991 season. After the Bullets failed to repeat their 1990 form and failed to make the NBL finals, McLeod retired from playing professional basketball at the age of 34.\nInternational career.\nMcLeod played for the Australian Boomers at the 1978 FIBA World Championship in the Philippines, helping the team to a then best 7th place. He also represented the Boomers at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where the team finished in 8th position despite the boycott of the games by the gold medal favourite United States.\nCoaching career.\nMcLeod started his NBL coaching career with a 2-game stint as player-coach for the Cascade Tassie Devils in 1989 before becoming the first head coach of the West Sydney Razorbacks in 1998. He would lead the team to the 2002 NBL grand final series against the Adelaide 36ers though the Razorbacks would lose the three game series one game to two. He would lead the Razorbacks to a second NBL grand final in the 2003–04 NBL season. In the first ever five game series the Razorbacks would lose to their cross-town rivals the Sydney Kings 2–3 in a close series. After leading by as much as 17 points in the 3rd period and 79–72 with only 3:10 left in the deciding Game 5, the 'Pigs' were overrun by a suddenly red-hot Kings team who scored the last 18 points of the game to win 90–79.\nDespite leading them to the Grand Final in 2004, McLeod was not retained by the Razorbacks for the 2004–05 NBL season. He would sign to be the head coach of the league's new Singapore Slingers team for the 2006–07 NBL season, leading them to the NBL playoffs in their first year in the league.\nAfter the Slingers withdrew from the NBL following the 2007–08 season, McLeod was appointed as assistant coach of the Aussie Boomers squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing where they finished in 7th place with a 3–3 record.\nMcLeod re-joined the Wollongong Hawks as head coach for the 2009–10 NBL season, leading the team to a second place regular season finish with a 16–12 record. The Hawks fought their way into their third NBL grand final where they lost one game to two to the Perth Wildcats. McLeod was rewarded for his coaching efforts during the season as he won his first NBL Coach of the Year award.\nThe Hawks had an injury hit season in 2010–11 and they just missed the playoffs despite a 15–13 record. McLeod finished the year with a career NBL coaching record of 149–173, moving him to 14th in all time coaching career wins.\nIn June 2014, McLeod re-signed as head coach of the Hawks for a further three years. However, in June 2015, he was released from his contract. The following month, McLeod was hired by the Cairns Taipans as an assistant coach for the 2015–16 season."

        "title": "Chris Turner (American football)",
        "text": "Christopher Evenson Turner (born September 8, 1987) is an American football quarterback. He played quarterback for the Maryland Terrapins at the University of Maryland from 2007 to 2009. Turner began his career at Maryland as a redshirt in 2005 and then served as a reserve quarterback before he earned the starting position.\nAfter a redshirt season in 2005, Turner saw no playing time as the third-string quarterback the following year. In 2007, he replaced the injured starter during the game against 10th-ranked Rutgers and led the Terrapins to an upset victory. After that, he remained as the team's leader for the remainder of the season, and against eighth-ranked Boston College, engineered another upset victory. Turner also helped Maryland secure an appearance in the Emerald Bowl. At the start of the 2008 season, he was relegated to backup status, but soon regained the starting position. That year, he led Maryland in wins over four of their five ranked opponents and to an appearance in the Humanitarian Bowl. He returned as the starter for the 2009 season, but suffered a knee injury and was replaced by Jamarr Robinson.\nEarly years.\nTurner was born in Simi Valley, California to parents John and Grace Turner. His father was the original drummer of the glam metal band Ratt. Chris Turner attended high school at the Chaminade College Preparatory School, where he was a three-year letterwinner and starting quarterback in football and pitcher in baseball. As a sophomore, he was on the junior varsity football team until midseason when the varsity quarterback suffered an injury against Valencia High School, a regional powerhouse. Turner described the incident as the last time that he was nervous during a game and said, \"It got pretty ugly to be honest. Ever since then, I've always thought to myself, 'It can't get worse than that.'\"\nAt Chaminade, he led a pass-oriented offense and, during his senior year, accumulated 139 completions on 265 attempts, 2,047 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He was named to the All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) second team as a senior and the All-Mission League team as both a junior and senior. SuperPrep picked him as a Far West all-region selection and PrepStar as an all-region selection. Turner was assessed as a Rivals.com three-star and Scout.com two-star recruit. He received scholarship offers from Boise State, Illinois, Louisville, Maryland, Oregon, Utah, and UTEP. Maryland offered him after another Californian recruit, Josh Portis, chose Florida instead—although Portis later transferred to Maryland and served as a backup alongside Turner. Turner ultimately chose Maryland, which is located just outside Washington, D.C., partly due to his interest in politics.\nCollege career.\nExperience.\nTurner sat out his true freshman year during the 2005 season on redshirt status. In 2006, he served as the third-team quarterback behind starter Sam Hollenbach and reserve Jordan Steffy, but Turner saw no playing time during that season.\n2007 season.\nIn 2007, as the second-string quarterback, he saw his first action against Villanova when he was substituted for injured starter Jordan Steffy. Turner executed a scoring drive and completed four of six passes, but also threw two interceptions. He sat out the next two games and then took one snap against Wake Forest. When the unranked Terps faced 10th-ranked Rutgers, Steffy suffered a concussion and Turner again filled in. He led drives for two touchdowns and two field goals in an upset of the Scarlet Knights, 34–24. About the then relatively unknown Turner, Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano said, \"I wish I would have seen this guy before.\" Turner started for the remaining eight games of the season. In his career-first start, he passed for 255 yards in a win against Georgia Tech, 28–26. In the game, he threw a 78-yard touchdown pass, which was caught by tight end Jason Goode rather than his intended receiver, Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a three-game losing streak, Turner led another upset win over a top-ten team, this time against eighth-ranked Boston College, 42–35. In the 24–16 loss to Florida State, Turner had his worst performance of the season. Late in the second quarter, he was benched and replaced by Steffy for two possessions. Turner said, \"I didn't know that my leash was that short in the first place, to be honest. I didn't think it would come to this. I guess I should have.\" After an uneven performance by Steffy, Turner played the entire second half and showed improvement. The following week Maryland played their regular season finale against NC State and both teams needed an additional win to attain bowl eligibility. Maryland led in the second quarter, 3–0, but was struggling offensively. Turner, a generally immobile pocket quarterback, invigorated the offense when he executed a 41-yard option run for a first down. He completed 19 of 24 passes for 206 yards and led a shutout of NC State, 37–0. With the sixth win, Maryland was invited to the Emerald Bowl, where they were beaten by Oregon State, 21–14. Turner finished the season as the third-most efficient passer in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\n2008 season.\nIn 2008, Maryland hired a new offensive coordinator, James Franklin, who installed a West Coast offense. That season started with some controversy when head coach Ralph Friedgen initially selected senior Jordan Steffy as the starting quarterback. Turner considered returning home with a transfer to a Californian school, but ultimately decided against it. When Steffy was injured again in the season-opener against Delaware, Turner was awarded the starting job for the rest of the season. After Maryland defeated 21st-ranked Wake Forest, 26–0, Turner was voted the ACC Player of the Week and ESPN named him an \"On the Mark\" quarterback. Against 16th-ranked North Carolina, Turner's split-second decision to hold onto the ball for a nine-yard run on fourth down and five put the team within range for the game-winning field goal, 17–15. For that, he was nominated for the week's Pontiac Game Changing Performance. The win improved Maryland's record to 7–3 and reasserted control over their ACC championship destiny, although they lost the next game against Florida State, 37–3, which ended the Terrapins' title hopes. The following week against Boston College, Turner set career highs with 33 completions, 57 attempts, and 360 passing yards, but the effort fell short and Maryland lost, 28–21. In the postseason, the Terrapins played Nevada in the Humanitarian Bowl where Turner threw for 198 yards, one interception, two touchdowns including a 59-yard long, and a two-point conversion. At the end of the season, Maryland had beaten four out of their five Top 25-ranked opponents, a feat that was surpassed only by the teams in the BCS Championship Game: Florida and Oklahoma.\n2009 season.\nFifth-year senior Turner entered the 2009 season as the uncontested starter at quarterback for the first time in his career. He was backed-up by sophomore Jamarr Robinson and true freshmen C. J. Brown and Danny O'Brien. Turner's seniority was called critical for the performance of the team's relatively youthful offensive line. Head coach Friedgen said, \"If I had to choose between a veteran offensive line and an inexperienced quarterback, or an inexperienced line with a veteran quarterback, I think I'd go with the veteran quarterback.\" Upon the conclusion of preseason camp, the coaching staff praised his progress, particularly his game-planning, for which he had been criticized in the past. Turner said, \"Mentally, I am way further ahead than where I was last year.\" Physically, he dropped 16 pounds by adding muscle and losing body fat, and weighed 220 pounds before the start of the season. Offensive coordinator Franklin said, \"You look at him, he was kind of mushy last year. You look at him now and he's muscular and shaped. He looks more athletic.\"\nBefore the season, Turner was added to the watch list for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, an annual honor bestowed upon the nation's top senior quarterback. At that time, he ranked as the school's fourth all-time quarterback in terms of completion percentage, fifth in completions, seventh in total offensive yards, and he is tied for 11th in number of touchdown passes. In June 2009, Turner stated that he wanted to leave a \"legacy\" at Maryland in his final season. He also expressed a desire to pursue a professional playing career in the National Football League (NFL) if possible. The NFL Draft Scout assessed Turner as the 16th-ranked quarterback out of the 135 available for the 2010 NFL Draft and projected him as a potential seventh-round selection.\nPlaying style and personality.\nPrior to his senior year, Jeff Barker of \"The Baltimore Sun\" noted that Turner's strengths were \"poise, smarts, [and] toughness,\" while he had room for improvement in arm strength and mobility. Barker said, \"He's a bit streaky—he calls himself a 'rhythm' passer … But he doesn't quit when things go poorly. His coolness can be mistaken for apathy.\" Turner typically confines himself to the pocket, as his ability to run the ball himself is limited by his speed. He has made light of his own lack of quickness by saying that he runs a \"flat 5.0\"-second 40-yard dash. The CBS Sports-affiliated NFL Draft Scout records his actual time as ranging from a low of 4.89 to a high of 5.16 seconds, while Scout.com reports his 40-yard time as 4.8 seconds. Turner's supposedly one-dimensional nature, however, has occasionally allowed him to make unexpected plays with his feet. The most noteworthy of these were the momentum-changing 41-yard option run against NC State in 2007, and the fourth-down nine-yard scramble into field goal range against North Carolina in 2008.\nPundits and coaches sometimes characterized Turner as a quarterback who did not excel during practices, but executed well on game-day. Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen said \"He's pretty go-with-the-flow. And that's his greatest strength and maybe his greatest weakness. The bottom line is, he plays well in games.\" \"The Baltimore Sun\" wrote that he \"seems to play his best when it counts—and his worst when it doesn't.\" Regarding the 2008 summer practices, offensive coordinator James Franklin said Turner ranked in the middle compared with Jordan Steffy and Josh Portis in terms of completion percentage, fewest interceptions, and \"explosive\" plays that gained 16 yards or more. Turner conceded that Steffy was a better game-planner during practices. Head coach Ralph Friedgen who had offered critical or subdued assessments of Turners' practice, said his intensity grew after losing the starting position to Steffy prior to the 2008 season. Turner said, \"It lit a fire in me in the sense that I had to be ready.\"\nAmong his Maryland teammates and coaches, Turner earned a reputation as an archetypal \"laid-back\" Californian and for remaining calm under pressure. After the 2007 win over Rutgers, offensive tackle Scott Burley described his roommate Turner as \"real calm [in the huddle] . . . He would say, 'Guys, are you ready to score again? Are you ready to run the ball on these guys?' And we're like, 'Yeah, let's do that.'\" Turner received the nicknames \"Sunshine\" and \"Napoleon Dynamite\", in reference to his similar appearance to the fictional characters in the films \"Remember the Titans\" and \"Napoleon Dynamite\", respectively.\nPersonal life.\nTurner graduated from the University of Maryland in May 2009 with a bachelor's degree in government and politics. His strong interest in politics factored into his decision on where to attend college. He chose the University of Maryland partly based on its close proximity to Washington, D.C. Turner's political views are liberal; he is registered as a Democrat, and has described himself as an idealist.\nDuring the 2008 season, political discussions were common in the Maryland locker room because of the presidential election. Turner and fellow quarterback Jordan Steffy, a conservative and supporter of presidential candidate Senator John McCain, were the most frequent debaters, while defensive tackle Dean Muhtadi was described as the primary instigator. During the summer of 2009, Turner held an internship on Capitol Hill working for Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader and Maryland's fifth district congressman. Turner had previously considered volunteering for the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, which he said probably annoyed his conservative father, John Turner. Describing his experience during the internship, Turner said, \"It's funny to compare how serious politics is and how serious football is. Depending on who you talk to, they're both pretty big deals . . . There's more to life than football.\"\nTurner's favorite sport, incidentally, is soccer, not football. He is also interested in foreign cultures and expressed regret at being unable to spend a semester abroad because of college football. Turner said that, dependent upon the outcome of his football career, he would like to attend the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

He played all or part of six seasons in the Major League Baseball from to , chiefly as a reliever. After his MLB career, he played three seasons for the Orix BlueWave in the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) from until \nPro career.\nHoffman signed with the Chicago White Sox as an undrafted amateur free agent on July 17, 1978. He made his professional debut for the Appleton Foxes of the Midwest league. Hoffman was part of a well stocked pitching staff that included prospects like Britt Burns and LaMarr Hoyt. Hoffman went 2–0 with two saves, appearing in seven games. The next season, Hoffman was promoted to the Iowa Oaks, a team well stocked as well with future major league talent like Harold Baines, Kevin Bell, Rusty Kuntz, Marv Foley, and Thad Bosley. Though the Sparks finished 69-67 (manager Joe Sparks was fired midseason, and Tony LaRussa was hired to replace him), Hoffman went 6–0 with a 3.34 ERA and 34 strikeouts. Being undefeated over the course of two minor league seasons was good enough for the White Sox to promote Hoffman to the major league roster. On July 4, 1979, Hoffman made his MLB debut. Coming on in relief of starting pitcher Ross Baumgarten, Hoffman pitched two innings, giving up one hit, walking two, and striking out one in Chicago's 16–4 win over the Cleveland Indians. Even though Hoffman allowed the hit that scored Duane Kuiper, Kuiper was still Baumgarten's responsibility. In his first full inning of work, Hoffman struck out Toby Harrah, allowed a hit to Cliff Johnson, then retired Gary Alexander and later, Dave Rosello to leave Kuiper stranded.\nHowever, the major league experience proved to be a wake-up call for Hoffman, who went 0–5, earning the first losses of his professional career. He was sent back to the minors for more seasoning, and his career began to have its ups and downs. He appeared in just 11 games for the White Sox in 1983, spending the rest of the season in the minors. At the end of the 1984 season, the White Sox gave Hoffman his outright release. In 1985, he signed with crosstown rivals the Chicago Cubs. While Hoffman went 6-2 for the Cubs, he struggled to stay in the majors. Before spring training in 1987, the Cubs traded Hoffman to the Cincinnati Reds for third baseman Wade Rowdon. At the age of 30. Hoffman had his most productive season in the majors, going 9-10 and starting 22 games, the most he'd ever start in the majors. Despite his success, the Reds released Hoffman at the end of the season, and he signed with the Texas Rangers the following spring. Much like with the Cubs, Hoffman played in only a handful of games for Texas. Hoffman appeared in his final MLB game on September 21, 1988, against the very team he made his MLB debut with, the Chicago White Sox. Hoffman faced two batters before being replaced by Ed Vande Berg. The Rangers lost 6–1.\nHoffman then went to Japan to play three seasons for the Orix Braves. Hoffman went 20–19 over three seasons before retiring in 1991 at the age of 34."

Inaugurated in 1991, the World Cup began as an attempt to create a regular season under its management in tandem with the ITU Triathlon World Championship race. However, this meant that there was a World Cup champion as well as a world champion. Following the 2008 series the ITU reorganized its top level competitions and created the World Triathlon Series, a series of races that was to be the successor of the World Championship. Meanwhile, the World Cup was relegated to become a second tier series, as a result the number of races in the World Cup were reduced. Since the reformat, points earned in World Cup racing are now applied only to an athlete's World Ranking.\nPoints.\nAt its founding the first twenty athletes each race would earn points dependent on their placing and the athletes with the most points at the end of the season would be named the World cup champion. \nWith the reorganization in 2009 and the discontinuation of the world cup champion title it was decided that world cup points should contribute to an athlete's world series. This was managed by allowing athletes best two world cup placements could be considered as part of their world series ranking. However, due ranking being based on an athlete's four highest scoring appearances that year along with the fact that world series races were worth 2.5 times as much as a world cup meant that no contribution was made to any athlete in the top 10.\nAfter 2014 world cup points totals were increased awarding first place 500 points and each subsequent athlete 7.5% less points that the athlete before for the first 50 athletes as long as they made the time cut (5% to the winner's time in the men's event and 8% in the women's event).

        "title": "Big wall climbing",
        "text": "Big wall climbing is a form of rock climbing that takes place on long multi-pitch routes (of \"at least\" 6–10 pitches or 300–500 metres) that normally require a full day, if not several days, to ascend. In addition, big wall routes are typically sustained and exposed, where the climbers remain suspended from the rock face, even sleeping hanging from the face, with limited options to sit down or escape unless they abseil back down the whole route (a complex and risky action). It is therefore a physically and mentally demanding form of climbing.\nBig wall climbing is typically done in pairs in a traditional climbing format, but with the distinction that the non-lead climber usually ascends by jumaring up a fixed rope to save time and energy. It requires an extensive range of supplies and equipment over and above that of traditional climbing that is carried in haul bags, including portaledges, aid climbing equipment, poop tubes, and food and water. It requires additional techniques such as pendulums/tension traversing, aid climbing, using trail ropes, jumaring, and sometimes simul climbing.\nBig wall climbing began in the Dolomites with early pioneers such as Emilio Comici inventing many of the first techniques and tools in the 1930s, and then spreading throughout the entire European Alps by climbers such as Riccardo Cassin and Walter Bonatti with his milestone solo ascent of the Dru in 1955. From the 1960s, American climbers led by Royal Robbins developed Yosemite into the most important big wall climbing venue in the world, with Lynn Hill's 1993 first free ascent of \"The Nose\" at on El Capitan being an important milestone in big wall history. Major high-altitude big-walls have been scaled in Patagonia and in the Himalayas.\nDescription.\nBig wall climbing is rock climbing on large routes that often take a full day, if not several days, of continuous climbing to ascend. Big wall climbing is a form of multi-pitch climbing but there is no definition of how many pitches are needed for a route to be a big wall; a minimum of \"at least\" 6–10 pitches (or roughly 300–500 metres) is typically required. Big wall climbing is usually done in pairs as lead climbing, however, due to the length of the climbs, the second climber usually ascends via a fixed rope to save energy and time.\nBig wall climbing can be performed as free climbing, however, it is common for big wall climbers to use some level of aid climbing on the route, as it is often impossible for very large multi-pitch routes to have a uniform level of difficulty (i.e. there may be some sections that are well beyond the difficulties of the rest of the route). Most big wall routes require traditional climbing techniques for climbing protection however some routes have bolted sections (or pitons) like sport climbing routes. Big wall routes have also been free solo climbed.\nBig wall climbing routes are typically sustained and exposed, where the climbers are suspended from the rock wall during their entire ascent with limited availability to sit down (e.g. few large ledges), or to escape from the wall other than by abseiling back down the entire route (which can be itself a risky process). Big wall climbing is thus a more serious undertaking than multi-pitch climbing, and climbers will generally only attempt big wall routes at grades that they can easily manage as multi-pitch routes.\nThe duration and sustained exposure of big wall climbs require greater equipment—and equipment-handling skills—over and above what is required for multi-pitch routes. Big wall climbers need to be able to haul gear and supplies up the route as they climb (using pulleys and haul bags), ascend on fixed ropes (the non-leading climber), build major anchor points (for hanging belays), hammer-in bolts and pitons as required, and set up portaledges for resting and sleeping. Given the length of the routes, this must happen efficiently.\nNotable walls.\nIn determining what is a \"big wall\", there is not only debate about the height requirements but also on whether it includes alpine climbs such as the north faces of the Eiger and the Matterhorn, which also have a lot of snow and ice. Regardless, a number of walls are considered particularly notable in the development of big-wall climbing:\nIn addition to the above big walls, several other locations are regarded as having impressive big walls that are climbed. However, their level of challenge (sometimes due to the variable or poor quality of the rock) has not been as notable in the development of big wall climbing; they include Troll Wall (Norway), Cerro Autana (Venezuela), Naranjo de Bulnes (Spain), Tsaratanana Massif (Madagascar), Potrero Chico (Mexico), Ketil (Greenland), and Notch Peak and The Streaked Wall (Utah).\nHistory.\nOne of the earliest examples of \"big wall climbing\" dates from 1887 when a 17-year-old Georg Winkler free soloed the Vajolet Towers in the Dolomites. The Dolomites were the birthplace of big wall climbing, and where pioneer Emilio Comici invented many big wall techniques such as aid climbing with multi-step aiders, hanging belays and bivouacs, advanced rope maneuvers, and leading with a trail rope. In 1933, Comici climbed the overhanging north face of the Cima Grande, then the world's hardest big wall route. Other pioneers such as Riccardo Cassin, himself a leading alpinist, created even harder new routes and spread big wall techniques across the Alps. In 1955, Walter Bonatti ushered in modern big wall climbing with his six-day solo of a new route on the southwest pillar of the Petit Dru, one of the most important big wall climbs in history.\nIn 1957, a team led by Royal Robbins climbed the \"Northwest Face of Half Dome\" in Yosemite, ushering in modern American big wall climbing. In 1958, a team led by Warren Harding aid climbed \"The Nose\" on El Capitan using siege tactics (600 pitons and 125 bolts) over 47 days; while the ascent got worldwide recognition it was controversial due to the excessive use of aid. Robbins' ethos of minimizing the use of aid prevailed over that of Harding, and his legacy of partially aided ascents including the \"Salathé Wall\" (1961), the \"North American Wall\" (1964), and the \"Muir Wall\" (1968) cemented Yosemite, and the granite walls of El Capitan, as the world's most important big wall climbing venue and Robbins' place in big wall history.\nThe development of big wall techniques and tools in the European Alps and in Yosemite led to a worldwide search for new big walls. In 1963, a team led by Chris Bonington established the first big wall routes on the Cordillera Paine, Chilean Patagonia, followed closely by new Italian-led routes. In 1972, Doug Scott, and later Charlie Porter, developed big wall routes on Mount Asgard, and highlighted the enormous big wall potential of Baffin Island. In 1976, a British team led by Joe Brown ascended one of the first-ever high-altitude big wall routes with the granite Trango (Nameless) Tower in the Karakoram, which was followed in 1992 by the two-man team of John Middendorf and who ascended the east buttress of the neighboring Great Trango Tower, putting up \"The Grand Voyage\" (1,340-metres, 33-pitches, VII 5.10 A4+), the longest big wall route in the world.\nFrom the late 1980s, leading sport climbers began to fully free-climb major big wall routes, and establish new testpieces. In 1988, Todd Skinner and Paul Piana freed the \"Salathe Wall\" on El Capitan at . In 1989, Wolfgang Gullich, with others, established the mega-route \"Eternal Flame\" on Nameless Tower (fully freed by the Hubers in 2009), and in 1991, created \"Riders on the Storm\" on the Torres del Paine. In 1993, Lynn Hill claimed one of the greatest prizes in big wall climbing by freeing \"The Nose\" on El Capitan at . In 2001, Alexander Huber freed \"\" on the Cima Ovest at . In 2015, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson freed \"Dawn Wall\" on El Capitan at . During this era, new milestones were also set in big-wall free solo climbing by Alexander Huber, with \"Brandler-Hasse Direttissima\" on the Cima Grande in 2012 at , by Hansjörg Auer, with \"Fish Route\" on the Marmolada in 2007 at , and by Alex Honnold with \"Freerider\" on El Capitan in 2017 at .\nEquipment.\nBig wall climbing requires all of the equipment used in traditional climbing and multi-pitch climbing (but in greater volume as the pitches are of fuller length), as well as specific additional items that are needed for extended multi-day muti-pitch big wall routes, including:\nTechniques.\nWhile the essence of big wall climbing is that of traditional climbing, and particularly multi-pitch climbing, it also uses a number of specific techniques that are important in being able to meet the unique challenges of ascending big wall routes, which include the following:\nGrading.\nBig wall climbing is used exclusively in relation to rock climbing. Long rock climbing routes that also have ice or snow, are referred to as alpine climbing. There is overlap in the skill sets, and many famous alpinists such as Walter Bonatti, Catherine Destivelle, and Alexander Huber, were also big wall climbers. The most common grading systems used in big wall climbing are the French, American (also known as the Yosemite Decimal System), and to a lesser extent the UIAA rock climbing grades for free climbing; the A-grade or C-grade systems are used for sections of aid climbing.\nIn addition to the above rock climbing grades (for both free climbing and for aid climbing), a National Climbing Classification System (NCCS) grade is sometimes quoted on North American big-wall (and alpine) climbs, that are described by the American Alpine Club (republished in 2013) as follows: \"North American NCCS grades, often called \"commitment grades\", indicate the time investment in a route for an \"average\" climbing team\":\nBecause of the great length of big-wall routes, detailed topos are usually provided outlining the grades on each pitch, and the aid climbing versus free climbing options at key sections. For example, one of the most famous big wall routes is the 31-pitch 870-metre route \"The Nose\", on El Capitan, which is graded VI 5.9 C2 as a partial aid climb (mainly due to its roof section), but which is graded VI if climbed completely free.\nEvolution of grade milestones.\nThe following big wall free climbing redpoints (i.e. no aid) are notable in the evolution of big wall climbing grade milestones and standards from being a skill used in alpine climbing to a standalone sport in its own right; some are at the borderline of being multi-pitch rather than big wall climbs:\nHigh altitude and expedition.\nA number of big wall-free climbs are notable for their high altitude or the remoteness of the expedition:\nIn film.\nA number of notable films have been made focused on big wall climbing including: "

They were led by tailback Archie Griffin on offense and a defense that held its opponents to less than 100 yards per game of total offense. Going into the showdown at #4 Michigan, they had risen to #1 by outscoring their first nine opponents 361–33, including three straight shutouts of Northwestern, Illinois, and Michigan State.\nThe Buckeyes and Wolverines then battled to a 10–10 tie, making it uncertain who would win the vote among Big Ten athletic directors to determine the league's Rose Bowl representative. Although the Big Ten had done away with its \"no repeat\" rule a year earlier, many projected that Michigan would win the vote since Ohio State had gone to Pasadena the prior year. But Michigan starting quarterback Dennis Franklin had broken his collarbone late in the Ohio State game; perhaps influenced by the injury, the athletic directors voted to send Ohio State to the Rose Bowl. Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler called it a gross injustice.\nUSC.\nUSC was the defending national champion and began the season ranked first. But a 7–7 tie vs. Oklahoma and a 23–14 loss to Notre Dame dropped the Trojans to #9. They then needed a miracle comeback to beat Stanford getting a touchdown and field goal sandwiched around an onside kick in the last minute of the game. They went into the Rose Bowl decider as a slight underdog against #8 UCLA, but forced six turnovers and knocked off the \nGame notes.\nSimilar to the previous year, the game was tied at halftime, then dominated by the victor in the second half. USC regained the lead briefly at 21–14 early in the third quarter, then Ohio State scored four unanswered touchdowns to \nKicker Chris Limahelu's 47-yard field goal was the longest ever by a Trojan, breaking a 64-year-old record (Limahelu died of prostate cancer in 2010 at age 59). This was the last time Ohio State defeated USC until 2017 in the Cotton Bowl. The Trojans won the next seven meetings from 1974 to 2009, including three Rose Bowls (January 1975, 1980, 1985).\nThis was the second of three consecutive Rose Bowls involving these two teams, and USC won the other two. Ohio State stopped a four-game winning streak by the Pac-8 (now Pac-12), but the next Big Ten victories were seven and fourteen years away. The Buckeyes' next Rose Bowl win came in January 1997, stopping previously undefeated Arizona State."

He played football, basketball and baseball at Coral Springs High School, and played baseball at Broward Community College for two years before transferring to the University of Florida as a junior. After the 1985 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. As a senior, he tied a team record by pitching ten complete games in the postseason. After which, he was drafted by his hometown New York Yankees in the fourth round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft.\nHe went 14-6 with a 2.84 earned run average in two seasons in the Yankees' farm system when he was packaged with Dan Pasqua and Mark Salas, and sent to the Chicago White Sox for pitchers Richard Dotson &amp; Scott Nielsen on November 12, .\nChicago White Sox.\nHe was 2-0 with three saves &amp; a 3.33 ERA for the Pacific Coast League's Vancouver Canadians in when he got the call to the majors. He made his major league debut on June 4, and was hit hard by the Texas Rangers. In two innings, he gave up three runs on four hits and a walk. He earned the only save of his career on August 17 against the Toronto Blue Jays, and lost his only decision of the season in extra innings to the Minnesota Twins on September 10.\nHe earned his first major league win on May 14, 1989, against the Baltimore Orioles.

        "text": "Kenneth Francis Gray (24 June 1938 – 18 November 1992) was an international rugby union player from New Zealand. He represented New Zealand in 24 international games, playing lock and later prop forward.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHe was born in 1938 in Porirua. He attended Plimmerton School and later Wellington College. As a child he was involved in many sports and showed a particular interest in rugby and showjumping.\nHe was a sheep farmer in Pauatahanui, the location of his family's farm. He was married to Joy with whom he had three children.\nRugby career.\nGray played rugby for the Petone Rugby Club and was picked to play provincial rugby for Wellington before the age of 20. In 1963 he was selected for the All Blacks. He played 50 matches for New Zealand, 24 of them test matches, between then and 1969.\nGray was regarded as an intelligent, vigorous and highly mobile forward who was especially noted a lineout jumper. He could play on either side of a scrum. He captained Petone to win the Jubilee Cup three years in a row in 1967, 1968 and 1969.\nIn 1970, he refused to tour South Africa in protest at its policy of apartheid and retired from the game. Initially he cited family and business reasons for his sudden withdrawal from the game before the real reason was revealed several months later. He stressed his decision was a personal one and did not think that the New Zealand Rugby Union should have cancelled the tour as it was the government's decision \"if it had the gumption\".\nTrevor Richards, national chairperson of Halt All Racist Tours (HART) said Gray's decision was a generation ahead of its time:\nGray was a prominent critic of 1981 Springbok tour of New Zealand and joined the public demonstrations and protests against on the tour.\nPolitical career.\nHe was elected a Hutt County Councillor in 1971 as the member for the Taupo riding. His father preceded him as a member of the Hutt County Council. In 1973 when the riding he represented was absorbed into the Porirua City Council he was elected as a Porirua City Councillor, serving until 1977. Later he was elected to the Hutt Valley Energy Board. He joined the Labour Party and became the vice-chairman of the Kapiti Labour Electorate Committee. Gray served as a board member for New Zealand Rail and chairman of the Government Health Sponsorship Council.\nHe publicly supported the legalisation of homosexuality in New Zealand, a stance for which he received much criticism from contemporaries. Fran Wilde, who introduced the bill to legalise, said Gray did much to dispel public ignorance on the issue.\nIn 1986 he was elected to the Wellington Regional Council in the Porirua ward on the Labour Party ticket where he continued to serve until his unexpected death in 1992. He was chair of the council's operations committee and between 1989 and 1992 he was the council's deputy chairman.\nIn the lead up to the 1987 election Gray put himself forward to replace the retiring Gerry Wall as Labour candidate for the Porirua electorate. He was regarded as the favourite in the lead up but in a shock upset he missed out on the nomination to trade unionist Graham Kelly. Three years later he stood for the Labour candidacy in the seat of Wanganui for the 1990 election, but missed out again.\nIn August 1992, Gray was selected as the Labour candidate for Western Hutt parliamentary electorate in the 1993 election, but he died before the election. This seat was held by National at the time. Historian Lindsay Knight said it was \"a seat which he almost certainly would have won\". Labour Party leader Mike Moore said \"Ken was an outstanding citizen ... He was a man of firm principle. He would have made a marvellous Member of Parliament. Having given more than most people in two lifetimes, he still had so much more to give us.\"\nDeath.\nGray died suddenly in his sleep of a heart attack on 18 November 1992, aged 54 at his home in Pauatahanui. His funeral was at Old St Paul's, Wellington and he was buried at St Albans Churchyard, Pauatahanui.\nHonours.\nIn the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours, Gray was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to local-body affairs.\nThe Petone Rugby Club, where he played, commemorates him with the Ken Gray Academy. The Ken Gray Education Centre was established in a converted shearing shed on the Battle Hill Forest Farm, near the Gray family farm, Pauatahanui Inlet near Pauatahanui, after his death."

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1932 Summer Olympics. It was the eighth appearance of the event, which was established in 1900. The competition was held from Monday, August 8, 1932, to Wednesday, August 10, 1932. Twenty-four gymnasts from five nations competed. Each nation could enter a team of 5 gymnasts; Hungary sent only 4. The event was won by Romeo Neri of Italy, the nation's first victory in the event since 1920 and fourth overall (most among nations at the time). István Pelle of Hungary took silver and Heikki Savolainen of Finland earned bronze; it was the first medal in the event for each nation.\nThe scores of the top 4 individuals for each nation were summed to give a score for the team event. The individual apparatus events were separate from the all-around, with scores not being carried over between the individual events.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nThree of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1928 Games returned: fourth-place finisher Romeo Neri of Italy and sixth-place finishers Mauri Nyberg-Noroma and Heikki Savolainen, both of Finland. Savolainen had the highest total score at the 1931 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships but was not recognized as World Champion because he had not scored 60% or better in all of the exercises. Neither 1930 World Champion Josip Primozic of Yugoslavia or 1931 World Champion Alois Hudec of Czechoslovakia (who had scored below Savolainen in total but had reached 60% in each exercise) competed in Los Angeles.\nJapan made its debut in the event. Italy made its seventh appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1932 competition did not follow the aggregation method introduced in 1924 (roughly following the 1904 format) and used again in 1928. Instead, the apparatus events were completely separate from the individual all-around. In the all-around, each competitor performed a compulsory and an optional exercise on each of 4 apparati: parallel bars, horizontal bar, rings, and pommel horse; the vault featured 2 compulsory and 2 optional exercises for each gymnast. Each exercise received a score from 0 to 30. The score for each apparatus was determined by averaging the scores for the 2 or 4 exercises in that apparatus, so the apparatus score was also from 0 to 30. The individual total was the sum of the 5 apparatus scores, 0 to 150.\nResults.\nAn obligatory and a voluntary exercise was performed on each of the five different apparatuses: horizontal bar, parallel bars, pommel horse, flying rings (rings), and long horse vaulting (vault) (except that 2 obligatory and 2 voluntary exercises were performed on the vault). The results from the first four were divided by two and the score of the vault competition was added. The results based on total points."

The Libyan national team participated in the FIBA Africa Championship games three times, in 1965, 1970, and 1978, where they placed fifth, fifth, and tenth respectively. In past years, the federation was not very active, but recently began initiating a couple of important activities to improve the level of play in Libya and the African continent. FIBA Sports Director Lubomir Kotleba, assisted by Boujemaa Jdaini, President of the Technical Commission of FIBA Africa, visited the country for a FIBA Africa referees clinic. The Clinic was held on March 20–24, 2005 in Tripoli, with participation of 46 Referees and Referee candidates from Algeria, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia. The two FIBA experts used the clinic to explain the latest changes in basketball rules, mechanics of basketball officiating as well as topics like officiating psychology, handling rough game situations and cooperation with players and coaches. The clinic concluded with a written test of basketball rules, a physical fitness test and a practical officiating test for referee candidates. At the closing ceremony, at which representatives of the Ministry for Sport and National Olympic Committee took part, the President of the LBF, Omar T. El Burshushi said \"We all around Libyan Basketball are honored to be the host of one of the FIBA Africa Clinic for Referees in 2005. We are working very hard in improving the standard of our basketball. The organization of such clinic will certainly lead us towards better officiating.\"\nInternational Ambitions.\nAbdulrahman N. Saddigh, Secretary General of LBF has big ambitions for hosting international events: \"We have now completed in Tripoli two new sports halls which meet international requirements and we are ready to host the top African and even World competitions.\" In order to enhance the youth programs in the country, LBF hosted an international U21 tournament on April 12, 2005 in Tripoli with the participation of the national teams from Italy, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.

        "text": "Huntingdale Golf Club is a golf club located in Oakleigh South, Melbourne, Australia.\nThe origins of what would become Huntingdale Golf Club began in 1924, when a Committee leased some property in Doncaster Road, Doncaster and laid out an 18-hole course amid the surrounding orchards. The same Committee took over the assets of the Box Hill Golf Club and re-established it at the Doncaster Road site, under the name of Eastern Golf Club as it is known today.\nIn the years prior to the second World War, there had been many discussions on the merit of transferring the club on to the famous sandbelt area in the south east of Melbourne, but plans were held in abeyance due to the lack of suitable ground being available.\nEarly in 1938 a chance remark by one of the members elicited the fact that Mrs Creswick was considering the disposal of the old Melbourne Hunt Club grounds at East Oakleigh. The course design was entrusted to C.H. Alison, an English golf architect, who worked entirely from models, contour plans, and written information as to the topography of the ground. Former curator, the late Sam Beriman, was co-opted to adapt Allison's designs to the terrain. The course opened in 1941, and it was at that time the name Huntingdale Golf Club was adopted. Today with its development as a Club, and advancement as an Australian Championship Golf Course, the future of Huntingdale Golf Club is secure.\nRising to fame in March 1979 with the inaugural hosting of the Australian Masters, Huntingdale has emerged as one of the most recognisable golf courses in Australia, and the world. Since 1979, Huntingdale has played host to some of the most famous names in world golf, including Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Peter Thomson, Gary Player, Arnold Palmer, Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ian Woosnam, Ian Baker-Finch, Tom Watson, Nick Price, and Tiger Woods.\nIn 2008, Huntingdale celebrated the 30th year of hosting the Australian Masters and was recognised as the 'Home of the Australian Masters'.\nHuntingdale hosted the Australian Masters since its inception in 1979. However, this long association was broken in 2009, when the tournament began a venue rotation policy."

        "title": "1922 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1922 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 2, 1922, between the Washington &amp; Jefferson Presidents (W&amp;J) and the California Golden Bears. It holds several distinctions including being the only scoreless Rose Bowl Game, the first tie in a Rose Bowl, the first African-American quarterback to play in the Rose Bowl (Charles Fremont West from Washington &amp; Jefferson), the first freshman to play in a Rose Bowl (Herb Kopf of Washington and Jefferson), and Hal Erickson (W&amp;J) became the only man ever to play in two Rose Bowls (1919 and 1922), with two teams (Great Lakes Navy and W&amp;J), without losing. It was also the last to be played at Tournament Park and to be officially known as the Tournament East-West Football Game, and with only 450 students at the time, Washington &amp; Jefferson College was the smallest school to ever play in a Rose Bowl.\nGame summary.\nThe Cal team was highly favored in this game, causing one sportswriter to say \"All I know about Washington and Jefferson is that they're both dead.\"\nThe 1921 Washington &amp; Jefferson team, coached by Greasy Neale, went 10–0 in the regular season, defeating powerhouses Pitt, University of Detroit, and Syracuse. The 7–0 victory over rival Pitt was celebrated with a day of canceled classes and bonfire with inspiration speeches in front of the Washington County Courthouse. As the best team from the east, W&amp;J was invited to the 1922 Rose Bowl to play the best team from the west: the undefeated and heavily favored California Golden Bears. The Red and Black could only afford to send 11 men on the cross-country trip and graduate manager Robert M. Murphy mortgaged his house to pay his family's way. Thus, W&amp;J would be the last Rose Bowl team to play the same 11 men the entire game. During the train ride to Pasadena, in which Greasy Neale continued to prepare his men, one player caught pneumonia and could not finish the journey. Another player who had secretly stowed away on the train was given the ill player's ticket and roster spot.\nCal had outscored their opponents on the season, 312–33, but the W&amp;J defense held the Golden Bears' potent offense, led by Brick Muller, with no points and no completed passes, just two first downs, and only 49 yards rushing. In one of the most disputed plays in Rose Bowl history, a W&amp;J rushing touchdown was overturned for an offside violation. The game was notable as the last time a \"small school\" would be represented in the Rose Bowl. W&amp;J's team featured three Rose Bowl firsts: Herb Kopf was the first freshman to play, Charles Fremont West was the first African American to play quarterback, and Hal Erickson became the only man ever to play in two Rose Bowls, with two teams, without losing. W&amp;J's Russ Stein was named Most Valuable Player. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1991. The Red and Black finished the season with a share of the \"mythical national championship,\" as determined by the Boand System."

One of the more interesting highlights of the June draft was that five quarterbacks were selected including future NFL stars Jim Plunkett, Archie Manning, Dan Pastorini, Steve Bartkowski, Joe Theismann as well as Condredge Holloway, who went on to have a career in the Canadian Football League, where he was awarded Most Outstanding Player while playing for the Toronto Argonauts.\nDanny Goodwin, the nation's top pick, could not agree to terms with the White Sox and became the first top choice who did not sign a contract, instead choosing to attend Southern University in Baton Rouge.

He was one of three players from this draft to go directly into the bigs. Highly touted David Clyde was chosen by Texas as the nation's number one pick. He jumped from high school to the majors and won his first game as a Ranger shortly thereafter. But the hard-throwing left-hander developed arm problems and had a short-lived career. Besides Clyde and Winfield, Arizona State's Eddie Bane (Minnesota, 11th overall) went directly to the majors. Other selections of interest included, Jack Clark (San Francisco), who was drafted as a pitcher, and Lee Mazzilli (New York Mets). In the January secondary phase, Dick Ruthven (Philadelphia), Jim Sundberg (Texas) and Donnie Moore (Chicago Cubs), who was drafted as an outfielder, were chosen."

        "text": "The 1994 PPG Indy Car World Series season was the 16th national championship season of American open wheel racing sanctioned by CART under the name \"IndyCar\". The season consisted of 16 races. Al Unser Jr. was the national champion, his second CART title, and the rookie of the year was Jacques Villeneuve. The 1994 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Al Unser Jr. won the Indy 500 from the pole position, his second career victory in that event.\nMarlboro Team Penske dominated the 1994 CART season, winning 12 of 16 events including the Indianapolis 500. The three-car team of Al Unser Jr. (8 wins), Emerson Fittipaldi (1 win), and Paul Tracy (3 wins) swept the top three spots in the final season points standings, and had five 1-2-3 finishes over the course of the season. The Penske Team also made headlines during the month of May, when they unveiled the new Ilmor Mercedes-Benz 500I engine. The secretly-built, 209 in3 (3.42 L) displacement purpose-built pushrod engine, which was capable of nearly was constructed specifically for the Indy 500.\nOverview.\nThe season opener was won by Michael Andretti on his return to IndyCar racing after his unsuccessful season in Formula One. The rest of the 1994 season was dominated by Team Penske's PC-23 chassis, which won 12 of the 16 races. Penske driver Al Unser Jr. took the title. The Rookie of the Year title was taken by young Canadian Jacques Villeneuve. Veteran Mario Andretti retired at the end of the season.\nAnother major story started before the season. Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony George announced plans for the formation of what would become the Indy Racing League, with an intended focus on oval track racing and predominantly American drivers. This was nearly identical to NASCAR, which at the time had all American drivers and just two (of 31) races on road courses. The 1994 IndyCar season schedule featured six oval track races (37.5%) and eleven full-time drivers were from the United States (including Italian-born Mario Andretti and German-born Dominic Dobson). ABC Sports' Paul Page said during the broadcast of the race at Surfers Paradise that this announcement, \"\"could drastically affect what we know as IndyCar racing in the future\".\"\nTeams and drivers.\nNewman/Haas' Nigel Mansell was expected to contend once again. He was viewed as the greatest racer in the world at the time, as his back-to-back championships in two such diverse major racing series (Formula One in 1992 and IndyCar in 1993) were unprecedented. This feat remains unmatched today. His teammate Mario Andretti announced before the season that it would be his last, though he would later attempt Le Mans a few times (speculation was that he wanted to win the race just to settle that he was in fact greater than 1967 winner A. J. Foyt, who have both been argued as the greatest ever). Newman-Haas would continue to be the leading Lola team, using the new T9400.\n Marlboro Team Penske expanded to a three-car operation with defending Indianapolis 500 winner Emerson Fittipaldi, rising star Paul Tracy, and 1990 IndyCar Champion and 1992 Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr., defecting from Galles Racing after a disappointing 1993 campaign left him with just one win (Vancouver) and 7th in the standings. Penske changed to the new Ilmor engine in association with Mercedes-Benz rather than Chevrolet, who withdrew after 1993. Customer team Bettenhausen Motorsports with driver Stefan Johansson received the year-old PC-22 chassis as Penske began to utilise the new PC-23.\nRahal-Hogan Racing tackled a major project: the new Honda engine. Team leader Bobby Rahal and teammate Mike Groff would face a great challenge enduring the \"growing pains\" of the new engine. Fledgling Comptech Racing with rookie Parker Johnstone would be the only other entrant in 1994 to use the Honda engine, so Rahal and Groff would be providing the primary feedback.\nDick Simon Racing had a successful 1993 campaign with veteran Raul Boesel, who was 5th overall after a pole position at Milwaukee and 3 runner-up finishes. His new teammate would be Japanese Hiro Matsushita, replacing Scott Brayton who joined Team Menard. Simon would field a total af five cars for Indianapolis; Boesel, Matsushita, Tero Palmroth, Lyn St. James, and Hideshi Matsuda.\nGalles Racing were presented with new challenges for 1994. Both of their name drivers Al Unser Jr. and Danny Sullivan departed (to Team Penske and NASCAR respectively), leaving owner Rick Galles with young Adrián Fernández. He proved his worth in Indy Lights by winning four races (in his one and only season), and looked to be Mexico's next big star (the first since Héctor Rebaque and Josele Garza). Fernandez would contest his first full season after five trial runs in 1993 (including 7th at Detroit). Team and driver would also use the brand new Reynard 94I; the company entering IndyCar racing as a first-time constructor.\nChip Ganassi Racing hired \"prodigal son\" Michael Andretti, who was ready to return to winning ways after the 1993 Formula One season left a bitter taste in his mouth. Ganassi would also use the Reynard chassis. Michael's teammate in 1993 was the great three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna; Senna's friend and countryman Maurício Gugelmin (another F1 veteran), in his first full season, would be Andretti's new teammate.\nIndy Regency Racing hired Arie Luyendyk following his release from Ganassi Racing, thus ensuring that the 1990 Indianapolis 500 winner would not be on the sidelines. The team entered a second car at Laguna Seca for Indy Lights runner-up Franck Fréon of France.\nThe Forsythe/Green Racing team were new to IndyCar Racing. In 1993 they competed in CART's Formula Atlantic Championship with French-Canadian drivers Claude Bourbonnais and Jacques Villeneuve. Bourbonnais won seven times and was 2nd overall to fellow Canadian David Empringham by a mere four points, while Villeneuve won five times en route to 3rd in points (10 behind Empringham). The Green team preferred to take Villeneuve with them to IndyCar; perhaps because of his age (22 as opposed to 28) and/or because of his famous name.\nThe second four-time Indianapolis 500 champion Al Unser joined A. J. Foyt and Rick Mears (the other two four-time winners) in retirement after failing to qualify for the 78th running of the race. He later admitted that at this stage in his career that he was more interested in watching his son's career than focusing on his own racing.\nDrivers and teams.\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1994 Indy Car World Series season. All teams used Goodyear tires; Firestone would return one year later after a hiatus lasting for two decades.\nSchedule.\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\nSeason Summary.\nRace summaries.\nRace 1: Surfers Paradise.\n\"See 1994 Australian FAI Indycar Grand Prix\"\nRace 2: Phoenix.\nThis race was memorable for a scary incident at Lap 63. Hiro Matsushita, who had spent much time in the pits and was 18 laps down, and twice-lapped Teo Fabi touched in Turn 3 and hit the outside wall. Leader Paul Tracy, running just behind, was caught in the outer groove and was an innocent victim, piling into the two cars. Over ten seconds later, as the yellow flag came out and the field slowed down. Approaching the accident scene, Jacques Villeneuve moved into the upper lane to avoid a slowing Arie Luyendyk and Mario Andretti who were running side-by-side. This put the car into the marbles on the outside of the turn, leaving Villeneuve with no grip and heading straight for the crashed cars. With nowhere to go and no time to stop, Villeneuve T-boned Matsushita, thankfully just behind the cockpit area. This sent the front of Mastushita's car spinning to the bottom of the track, and throwing the engine and gearbox assembly into the side of Paul Tracy's car, partially striking his helmet. Dominic Dobson then collided with Villeneuve's car after the impact as it veered across the track towards the pit lane. No drivers sustained injuries, but Matsushita complained about a sore shoulder.\nAnother scary near-miss occurred during the final round of pitstops. Nigel Mansell, who had been fighting his way back through the field after stalling the car on his first pit stop, lit up his rear tires pulling away from his pit box, determined not to stall again. Unfortunately, the act of doing this caused him to pull out onto the warm-up apron too quickly on cold front tires, which gave little grip. Mansell understeered off the warm up apron, bouncing over the grass verge and back onto the track on the racing line, directly in the path of Buddy Lazier (mis-identified as Scott Goodyear on the ESPN broadcast). Lazier managed to slow just in time and avoided Mansell on the inside, waving his fist to make his displeasure known to the Englishman.\nOne other dangerous incident involved Mario and Michael Andretti. Late in the race, Mario suffered a mechanical failure on the backstretch and crashed into the outside wall, the car stopping at the apron at the bottom of the track. As the field came by, John Paul Jr. and Scott Goodyear slowed to avoid the accident just in front of Michael, creating a rapidly closing gap between the two cars. Michael, with nowhere to go, attempted to stop, but clipped John Paul Jr.'s right-rear tire. This broke off his left front wheel, which bounced over the nose cone into Scott Goodyear's car on Michael's right. The tire was then launched off of Goodyear's left-front wheel and into the air, sailing over the debris fence and landing in a spectator area. Amazingly, after two potentially fatal incidents, no serious injuries were reported. Emerson Fittipaldi scored the win ahead of Al Unser Jr. Third place Nigel Mansell was one lap down with Johansson and Vasser (both three laps back) completing the Top 5. Fittipaldi took the early championship lead with 37 PPG Cup points ahead of Johansson and Vasser with 22 each, Australia winner Andretti with 21, and Mansell at 19.\nRace 3: Long Beach.\nPolesitter Paul Tracy was still looking for his first finish of the season. He scored his second pole of the year (and thus his second championship point) and planned to convert his speed into a victory. On Lap 21 while lapping Mike Groff, Tracy spun using too much rear brake, and ended Groff's day. Later on, Jacques Villeneuve passed Toronto's Scott Goodyear on the outside of Turn 1. ABC's Bobby Unser chuckled in disbelief as he commented, \"That was an impossible pass!\" Villeneuve later braked too late in Turn 7 (the end of the backstraight) and slammed the tire barrier. Three seconds later, he re-fired the car and continued on without significant damage. He would finish five laps down in 15th. Tracy would spin again in Turn 1, this time while passing Maurício Gugelmin. Gugelmin was more fortunate than Groff and continued without contact. Both Tracy and Fittipaldi would retire with separate transmission failures. Up front, Al Unser Jr. reclaimed his throne as the \"King of the Beach\" by winning his 5th Long Beach event by 39 seconds over Nigel Mansell and 46 seconds up on Robby Gordon. The Californian became the 10th different leader in IndyCar's Long Beach history, such was the domination of Unser Jr. and the Andrettis in the first decade of the race. Raul Boesel and Mario Andretti capped the Top 5, as the championship battle was on. Fittipaldi and Unser were tied at 37 points each (both with a win and a second place), Mansell in third at 35 points, Michael Andretti with 29 points, Stefan Johansson (finishing 10th after running out of fuel) at 25 points, and Mario in sixth at 24 points as the teams prepared for the month of May.\nRace 4: 78th Indianapolis 500 mile race.\n\"See 1994 Indianapolis 500\"\nRace 5: Milwaukee.\nRaul Boesel started from the pole for the second year in a row. The race was run without incidents, but the racing was close and exciting. Marlboro Team Penske dominated the race with Emerson Fittipaldi and Indy 500 champion Al Unser Jr. Amazingly, 25 of 26 starters finished the race (only Stefan Johansson did not finish due to engine failure, 29 laps down to the winner), giving the leaders major headaches concerning traffic. The race was called eight laps from the end (192 of 200 laps) due to ensuing rain, with Unser in front winning his third consecutive race. Fittipaldi was second and Paul Tracy, two laps back, completed a Penske 1-2-3 sweep. Michael Andretti and Nigel Mansell rounded out the top five. Unser's lead increased to 25 points over Fittipaldi, 30 over Andretti, 34 ahead of Mansell, and 41 up on Robby Gordon.\nRace 6: Detroit.\nAl Unser Jr. looked to win four IndyCar races in a row coming to Detroit, a circuit at which he had never won. Unser himself was the most recent winner of four consecutive races, doing so in 1990 at Toronto, Michigan, Denver, and Vancouver. He also won the championship that year, and he was in prime position to win the title again. Nigel Mansell was on pole, and led the first lap. In Turn 3 Mike Groff slid off the course into the tyre barrier. He continued, but retired after seven laps, as did Raul Boesel due to engine failure. Late in Lap 2, Al Jr. took the lead from Mansell entering Turn 13. On Lap 21 Dominic Dobson spun in Turn 1, collecting Alessandro Zampedri who was directly behind him. Mario Andretti spun off at Turn 8 on Lap 47, and hit the tyres but was able to continue. Not so lucky was Adrian Fernandez, who brought out the yellow on Lap 50. Following the restart, Unser led teammate Paul Tracy while combating traffic. In Turn 8 Unser slowed sooner than Tracy expected (he likely couldn't see Jimmy Vasser immediately in front of Unser) and touched the championship leader's right rear tire, sending him into a tire barrier. Unser kept the car running after hitting the tires, but his chance of his fourth straight win was over. Soon after in Turn 3, Nigel Mansell spun off behind Emerson Fittipaldi, who like Unser was contemplating his moves in traffic. Tracy won the race, and said that he would immediately apologize to Unser as soon as he found him. Fittipaldi was second, with Gordon, Teo Fabi, and Michael Andretti coming across the line in the top five. Emmo knocked Little Al's point lead down to 13 points. Michael Andretti was 24 behind, Robby Gordon 31 back, and Nigel Mansell 37 down, as his hopes of title defense were looking slim.\nRace 7: Portland.\nAl Unser Jr. took pole position again, seeking to recover the ground he lost to Emerson Fittipaldi two weeks before. An incredible 32 cars took the green flag, showing the strength of the sport at the time. Lap 11 saw a dynamic exit for Michael Andretti, who collided with Jimmy Vasser in an attempt to pass him in Turn 1. Both were done; disappointing for both because Michael was 3rd in points and Vasser tied for 6th with Paul Tracy. The race saw little in the way of carnage, but after many successful passes were made by various drivers in Turn 1, the Lap 11 crash was reenacted by Bryan Herta and Scott Goodyear, who tried to overtake and paid the price on Lap 58. The battle for the win was again between Penske's Unser and Fittipaldi. On the final pit stop exchange, Emerson exited the pitlane and beat Al Junior into Turn 1. But on the exit of the corner, Junior accelerated sooner, properly anticipating Emmo's moves, and grabbed the lead. Unser's win was the sixth in a row for \"The Captain\", with Fittipaldi in second, Tracy third (another 1-2-3 sweep), and for fourth Robby Gordon edged Nigel Mansell. Both drivers crossed the line simultaneously (to the one-thousandth of a second), but the position was awarded to Gordon. Jacques Villeneuve was 6th, one lap back, followed by Alessandro Zampedri. His 7th-place finish would be his career best in a CART-sanctioned race. Al Unser Jr.'s lead over Fittipaldi was now 105–86. Robby Gordon was third for Walker Racing with 64 points, while Michael and Mansell were 46 and 49 points behind. Paul Tracy's season was coming together, as he now had 50 championship points, but still a long way behind Unser.\nRace 8: Cleveland.\nAl Unser Jr. claimed his third pole of the season. The first turn, which usually provides the most dramatic action at the Burke Lakefront Airport Circuit, saw Michael Andretti (who qualified a lowly 17th place) and Scott Goodyear spin. Bobby Rahal and the team had not yet eradicated the engine gremlins in the still-new Honda powerplant. Mario Andretti, whose final season started well, had more struggles with a failed suspension after 31 laps. Emerson Fittipaldi, in desperate need of points to kept up with Unser, retired with a small fire in the rear of his car. Michael Andretti's engine quit with just eight laps remaining, and Al Unser Jr. won his fifth race of the year; the seventh in a row for Penske. Runner-up Nigel Mansell had competed in the French Grand Prix for Williams during the off-weekend, with speculation that he may return to Formula One full-time for 1995. Tracy, Villeneuve, and Johansson completed the top five. Unser more than recovered what was lost at Detroit with a gruesome 41 point advantage over Fittipaldi, 55 over Mansell, 61 ahead of Gordon, and 63 points ahead of Tracy at the halfway point of the season.\nThis was Al Junior's 24th IndyCar win, and thus the 100th for the Unser family, adding to Al Senior's 39 wins, Uncle Bobby's 35, and 2 wins by Louis Unser (Al and Bobby's uncle). The Unsers are still the only family to win 100 or more IndyCar races combined, currently at 110.\nRace 9: Toronto.\nIndy Lights champion Bryan Herta had a season-ending accident in qualifying. A. J. Foyt did not find a replacement driver for the race, but Eddie Cheever would race the #14 for the remainder of the season.\nRobby Gordon won his first career pole ahead of Nigel Mansell. Emerson Fittipaldi and Michael Andretti would also be in the hunt, but championship leader Al Unser Jr.'s bid for three wins in a row ended on Lap 3 with a blown engine. While still in the lead, Robby suffered a burst left rear tyre in Turn One, handing the lead to Mansell on Lap 13. On Lap 26 Michael Andretti seized the moment and pounced on Nigel in Turn 8. Mansell immediately slowed, as his right rear was flat. He later parked the car with handling issues. On Lap 69 Adrian Fernandez tried an unsuccessful pass on the inside of Willy T. Ribbs, the two touching in Turn 3 and collecting Maurício Gugelmin who tried to sneak past on the outside. Mario Andretti easily passed by on the inside, where there was just enough room. Both Fittipaldi and Gordon (in third and fourth) had to stop because of their placements on the track in relation to the accident. Innocent bystander Mike Groff stalled the engine after having to stop. Michael Andretti took his record fourth Toronto win after problems with the air jack on the last pit stop. Bobby Rahal and Fittipaldi completed the podium, with Mario Andretti in fourth and home crowd favorite Paul Tracy one lap back in fifth. Fittipaldi whittled Unser's lead to 27, as the rest of the top six were as follows: Michael Andretti (-47 points), Robby Gordon (-52), Paul Tracy (-53), and Nigel Mansell (-55).\nRace 10: Marlboro 500 at Michigan.\nNigel Mansell set a new track record alongside Raul Boesel and Michael Andretti in a three-abreast start. At the start-finish line on Lap 24, third place runner Robby Gordon burst a right front tyre. Seemingly by instinct he gradually slowed the car under the yellow, never touching the wall, and was able to continue undamaged. Soon after polesitter Mansell suffered a stuck throttle, which he described to ESPN's Jon Beekhuis as, \"the scariest moment I've had in my whole career.\" On lap 65, Adrian Fernandez leapt from his racecar as methanol spilled during a routine pit stop. A moment later Michael Andretti jammed the brakes to avoid Paul Tracy and caught the wall, ruining the suspension. On Lap 78 rookie Jacques Villeneuve suddenly pushed up the banking into the wall in Turn 3, walking away unharmed.\nThe lead pack included the Penske cars of Unser and Fittipaldi, Raul Boesel, Scott Goodyear, and Robby Gordon, who recovered from his flat tire. Just short of halfway, Mario Andretti's engine failure made him the 11th retiree of the day. Inside of 70 laps remaining, Gordon's engine blew in the middle of Turns 3 and 4. He maintained control of the car for several seconds on the banking, but the new oil on the track took away his traction and sent him into a 270-degree spin entering the pitlane. He never completed the spin, and never touched a wall, but his race was over. On Lap 225, while leading, Raul Boesel's excellent chance to finally win his first IndyCar race ended when his Ford XB engine expired at 90% distance, handing the lead to Al Unser Jr. He hoped to be the first man to win the Indianapolis 500 and the Michigan 500 in the same year since Rick Mears in 1991, but six laps later he joined his teammates in the garage area causing the final caution flag of the race (his oil on the track), leaving just eight of the twenty-eight starters on track: Scott Goodyear, Arie Luyendyk (1 lap down), Dominic Dobson (2 laps back), Teo Fabi (4 laps), Mark Smith (-10 laps), Hiro Matsushita (-11 laps), Willy T. Ribbs (-13 laps), and Marco Greco, who finished 55 laps down in eleventh. Goodyear, the 1992 winner of the race, was the proverbial \"tortoise\" beating the quicker \"hares\" while giving the Lola chassis its only win in 1994. Al Unser Jr., despite his DNF, led with 132 points, 29 more than Emerson Fittipaldi at 103, Michael Andretti had 80 points, Gordon 75, Tracy 74, and Mansell 73.\nRace 11: Mid-Ohio.\nAl Unser Jr. rebounded from the disappointment from Michigan by winning his fourth pole position of the season. Saturday was plagued by excessive rain, so times from the first session of qualifications held on Friday were used to determine the race lineup. Paul Tracy took the lead from second place in Turn 4, which was the first turn as the green flag was given as usual on the backstretch. Early on, Mike Groff and Michigan winner Scott Goodyear touched and spun into the Turn 2 gravel battling for the twelfth position. Great racing was prevalent throughout the field, much of which orbited around Michael Andretti and Robby Gordon, both known for aggressive driving styles. On Lap 44 Tracy made a \"banzai\" move to put Adrian Fernandez one lap down, because Unser was not far behind. The two got very close, possibly touching, but Tracy gained a time advantage over Unser thanks to his bravery. Later Teo Fabi spun off in Turn 2, causing a local yellow. Robby Gordon, right in front of Tracy, slowed and nearly spun to obey the flags. Tracy passed Gordon with his momentum in the corner and was assigned a stop-and-go penalty, as was Mario Andretti for likewise overtaking in the yellow zone. Unser took the win ahead of Tracy and Emerson Fittipaldi, who started and finished 1-2-3. Gordon and Andretti finished one lap behind the Penskes, with Adrian Fernandez getting his new best career finish of sixth. The Penske drivers were 1-2-3 in qualifying, the race, and the championship: Unser led Fittipaldi 153-117, Tracy moved up to third at 91 points, Andretti at 90, Gordon 87, Mansell 79, and rookie leader Jacques Villeneuve was seventh with 54 points.\nRace 12: New Hampshire.\nEmerson Fittipaldi took his first pole in nearly a year. At the start, eighth place starter Adrian Fernandez spun across the track without contact. But in an effort to avoid him, Jacques Villeneuve and Arie Luyendyk crashed and were done for the day before taking the green flag, thus failing to start the race. Robby Gordon spun harmlessly. Luyendyk blamed the crash on the top qualifiers for bringing the field perhaps too slowly to the green flag. The resulting 25 car starting field was the smallest of the year, showing the strength of the sport at the time. A scary crash on Lap 13 involved Mike Groff and former Trans-Am champion Scott Sharp. Groff spun exiting Turn 2 and hit the outside wall; just behind him, Sharp spun to avoid him and was propelled by his kinetic energy onto Groff's nose. His car was launched into the air and flipped once and a half, leaving the Connecticut native hanging upside down in the car for approximately two minutes. The rookie was flipped carefully onto his wheels and walked away unharmed.\nFittipaldi led the first 46 laps until Paul Tracy took it from him on the outside in Turn 3. Tracy was looking for redemption; he was now leading the race he nearly won the year before when he lost a duel with Nigel Mansell in the waning laps. Emerson soon lost second to Raul Boesel, and third to Nigel Mansell, and pitted several laps early to correct quite evident handling woes. Point leader Al Unser Jr., who started tenth, was climbing through the field. He was in the Top 5 by Lap 50. At Lap 69 Unser was side by side with his teammate at the stripe, and at Lap 70 he passed Tracy, who then lost second to Mansell. Unser pitted at Lap 82, followed by Mario Andretti and Tracy. Mansell stayed out 4 laps longer before his first stop. Once the stops were completed, Unser led Tracy and Mansell through a large collection of lapped traffic. Mansell's bid to win died slowly after he and teammate Mario Andretti touched in Turn 1 on Lap 109. Andretti was a lap down, but the two already had some bad blood between them. Mario hit the wall, bringing out the final yellow flag, while Mansell soldiered on for nearly 20 more laps before getting fed up with the poor handling.\nBy this time, the Penske cars were alone in the lead lap. Emerson Fittipaldi pitted before the restart, knowing he likely couldn't reach the checkered flag without another stop but he could have a much shorter stop within the final laps. That was the exact scenario that played out, as Emerson gained a lead as great as 22 seconds (nearly a full lap) after teammates Unser and Tracy pitted at Lap 152. By Lap 195 Emerson's lead had gradually shrunk by several seconds as he finally came into the pits. He was in his pit box for only 5.9 seconds, but Unser led another Penske 1-2-3 sweep ahead of Tracy and Fittipaldi. All three cars were separated by approximately nine tenths of a second from each other at the chequers, thanks to heavy traffic. Raul Boesel and Michael Andretti were two laps back in fourth and fifth. Dominic Dobson surprisingly qualified and finished sixth (three laps down) for PacWest Racing, who had recently tested at Mid-Ohio with Danny Sullivan. The 1988 PPG Cup Champion was rumored to drive a third PacWest car at Vancouver. The Penske juggernaut continued to lead the championship, with Unser leading at 173 points, Fittipaldi 133 points, Tracy 107, Michael Andretti 100, Gordon 87, and Mansell 79.\nRace 13: Vancouver.\nRobby Gordon was on pole for the second time in his career; his first pole coming in July at Toronto. After completing 8 laps, rookie Alessandro Zampedri retired in spectacular fashion with a fire in the rear of his car. He headed for the runoff area in the Turn 5 chicane, pointing behind him to get the attention of the course marshalls. Paul Tracy and Teo Fabi had a coming together while battling in the top five. Tracy made a clean pass in the Turn 3 hairpin, and Fabi tried to get it back in Turn 5. Tracy was committed to his line into the corner, and contact ensued. This happened immediately after 7th placed Al Unser Jr. made his first pit stop, and while only Gordon and Nigel Mansell stayed out, Unser restarted 3rd. Gordon's chance to win was soon greatly damaged when he missed Turn 10 and had to use the pitlane to rejoin the circuit. Because he clipped a wall in the incident, he suffered a puncture (just like in Toronto) and made an unscheduled green flag pit stop, dropping to 17th and handing the lead to Nigel Mansell. While Mansell established an 11-second lead, Michael Andretti passed Unser for 2nd place, recovering his position he lost in the early laps when he had a right rear puncture. Mansell and Michael pitted under yellow after Willy T. Ribbs spun and stopped precariously in Turn 8, and Unser took the lead.\nA lap after the restart, Paul Tracy spun in front of Emerson Fittipaldi in Turn 3 immediately after taking 5th from him. On Lap 95, Tracy was \"sandwiched\" between the Andrettis; Mario was ahead, a lap down, and Michael was behind. Tracy slowed conservatively for the Turn 10 complex (the final set of corners) and was hit by Michael. Unser won by 2.2 seconds over Robby Gordon, Michael Andretti, Scott Goodyear, and Maurício Gugelmin. A battle for fourth went wrong for two former World Champions, as Nigel Mansell tagged Emerson Fittipaldi in the final corner trying to outbrake him. Emerson fell to ninth in the results; resulting in a 56-point lead for Unser, who only needed a fourth-place finish at Road America to win the championship. Even if Fittipaldi, the only man who could stop Unser, won all three remaining races, Unser only needed 12 more points. Unser's eighth win of the year clinched the Nations' Cup for the United States and put him at 193 points, compared to Fittipaldi's 137, Michael at 114, Tracy 107, Gordon 104, and Mansell 83.\nRace 14: Road America.\nThe front row was all Canadian: Paul Tracy and rookie Jacques Villeneuve, equaling his best career start at Phoenix. Tracy was a carlength ahead of the rookie at the start, but Villeneuve used the slipstream to attempt and failed outside pass into Turn 1. Tracy ran away as Al Unser Jr. was mindful of what he needed to do to win the championship, running third behind Paul and Jacques. Unser and Villeneuve swapped positions after the first round of pit stops when the latter could not find a gear when trying to launch from his pit stall. Within 20 (of 50) laps to go, Arie Luyendyk crashed in \"The Kink\", which is Turn 11, nearly collecting German Christian Danner driving for Project Indy. The former F3000 champion took to the grass on the outside of the turn at over 160 miles per hour, nearly losing control, but showing nice car control and was not collected.\nOn the restart Tracy was caught up by Unser, who moved to the left to pass in the outside of Turn 1, and Vileneuve who chose the opposite side. Tracy moved to the right to outbrake Unser and keep the lead, touching with Villeneuve whom he wasn't anticipating. The order was now Villeneuve, Tracy, Unser, Emerson Fittipaldi, Teo Fabi, and Mario Andretti. Tracy soon began to slow, with an engine turning sour. Unser slowly gained on Villeneuve but didn't gain enough. Villeneuve became the fourth Canadian to win an IndyCar race; the first being his uncle Jacques nine years before in this race. Unser clinched the championship ahead of Fittipaldi, Fabi, and Adrian Fernandez. The championship battle was now for second; Fittipaldi was there with 151, ahead of Michael Andretti, who suffered two right rear punctures and a broken exhaust system in 45 laps after starting 20th, at 114, Tracy 109, and Gordon 104.\nRace 15: Nazareth.\nThe fewest entrants arrived at Nazareth: twenty nine; the fourth race of the season with this count (Milwaukee, Michigan, and New Hampshire). Emerson Fittipaldi won the pole alongside Paul Tracy. New champion Al Unser Jr. started 18th. Third place starter Nigel Mansell made an early unscheduled pit stop, ending any chance to win. By Lap 33 Unser moved up to third. Ten laps later the course was under yellow for a backstretch accident in which Eddie Cheever clipped hometown favorite Mario Andretti. His teammate Mansell retired with a loose racecar. On Lap 140 Jacques Villeneuve touched with Adrian Fernandez, who hit the outside wall (breaking off the right front), bounced off the inside wall, and struck the outside wall again before the car finally stopped. Fernandez walked away. Marlboro Team Penske defined domination as Paul Tracy, Al Unser Jr., and Emerson Fittipaldi finished four laps ahead of fourth place Raul Boesel, and Stefan Johansson another lap back in fifth. Unser and Fittipaldi had clinched first and second in the championship, so the battle for third was between Tracy at 130 and Andretti with 118. Jacques Villeneuve had already clinched the rookie award and appeared to be set for stardom.\nRace 16: Laguna Seca.\nThis race was the record 407th and final IndyCar race for the great Mario Andretti. He qualified twelfth, but for the pace laps was given honorary pole position. Former CART flagman Nick Fornoro came back to wave the green flag for Mario's last race.\nPaul Tracy won back-to-back poles and showed the form he struggled to find in the early part of the year. He set a new track record of 1:10.058 seconds. Exiting Turn 2 (the hairpin) Al Unser Jr. touched wheels with Robby Gordon and slid off the course. Michael Andretti outbraked Arie Luyendyk for eighth in Turn 3, but spun the rear wheels and spun out. Champions collided as four seconds later he was struck by an unfortunate Bobby Rahal, ending the day for both, and assuring Paul Tracy of third in the standings. Turn 3 and \"The Corkscrew\" (the Turn 8 downhill chicane complex which literally screws into itself) were the preferred places to pass behind Tracy. Robby Gordon spun twice, giving up a likely points finish. On Lap 82 Mario's career ended a few laps too early as he slowed with engine failure and ended 19th. Tracy took maximum points (22) ahead of Raul Boesel, who finished second for the fifth time in his IndyCar career. Jacques Villeneuve, Emerson Fittipaldi, Teo Fabi, Arie Luyendyk, and Adrian Fernandez were also in the lead lap. The final points went to Nigel Mansell, Andrea Montermini, Dominic Dobson, Willy T. Ribbs, and Stefan Johansson; all one lap down.\nThis race was also the last for Nigel Mansell. After the season, he ran the final three races in Formula One that season for Williams as the only active World Champion, as Alain Prost retired after the 1993 season and Ayrton Senna was killed while leading at Imola in May. After having raced at Magny-Cours in June, Mansell spun off in Jerez, finished fourth in Suzuka, and after title contenders Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill collided, won the finale in Adelaide, Australia. In 1995 he defected to McLaren, soon leaving the team due to an uncompetitive car.\nAlso exiting the sport were the King Racing team owned by drag racing legend Kenny Bernstein. A year later he would also pull the plug on his NASCAR Winston Cup operation; both were due to lack of competitiveness."

Designed by Willie Park, Jr. and Donald Ross, the Minneapolis golf course opened in 1916. The club hosted the U.S. Amateur in 1950 as well as the PGA Championship in 1959, which Bob Rosburg won.\nClub history.\nIn 1916, there were only two golf clubs in Minneapolis, Minikahda Country Club and Interlachen Country Club In early 1916, five members of the Minneapolis Athletic Club set plans to establish another golf club to meet the growing popularity of the game. By July, the Minneapolis Golf Club (\"MGC\") was incorporated. Land was acquired and nine holes were built on the site of present-day Golden Valley Country Club The opening of play at MGC commenced on the first Saturday of August 1916. Later that year, the club was approached by Hyland Homes Company to consider the purchase of a larger piece of intact farmland in St. Louis Park. The Scottish architect Willie Park Jr. had been retained to lay out the golf course. On December 9, 1916, the MGC membership voted to relocate to the present location. By June 19, 1917, MGC had become one of the earliest member clubs of the Minnesota Golf Association.\nBy 1918, MGC had 400 members and there was a regular shuttle service to and from the Minneapolis Athletic Club operating during the golf season. In September 1919, plans were initiated to build a new clubhouse to accommodate the now larger membership. The original clubhouse was a converted four-room farmhouse located near the present third tee. The new clubhouse was to be built on the northern section of the property. It opened on May 12, 1923. The rolling farmland our course was built on was virtually void of trees except for a stand of oaks in the northern section by today's 10th and 11th holes. The trees that line the fairways today were planted during a tree-planting program in 1930.\nCourse architects.\nTwo Scots, Willie Park, Jr. (1864–1925) of Musselburgh and Donald J. Ross (1872–1948) of Dornoch, at different times designed and routed the golf course. On November 26, 1916, \"The Minneapolis Tribune\" wrote, \"Willie Park, well known golf course architect, arrived yesterday to lay out the course of the Minneapolis Golf Club\". Discovered field notes of the original land survey firm show that Park routed the course in early December 1916. Ross' involvement is demonstrated thorough a routing plan of the course executed by Donald J. Ross Associates, Inc. in 1920 that was found by the Chair of the History Committee of the Donald Ross Society in 2011. The two routings are framed and displayed within the clubhouse. In 2019, golf architect Jeff Mingay led a restoration of the golf course design in conjunction with construction specialist Duininck Golf.\nGolf events.\nMGC has a great golfing tradition. It developed in part due to the quality design of the golf course. By the mid-1920s, MGC was growing in local and national recognition. In 1940, after Sam Snead played an exhibition match at MGC, he said that he \"hoped that (MGC) would some day host a U.S. Open\". The most prestigious amateur event was the Golden Anniversary (50th) U.S. Amateur in 1950. As result of holding the 1959 PGA Championship at MGC, the club is in elite company as one of only 120 golf clubs in the world to have hosted a Grand Slam event (Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA) since 1860.\nChampionships.\nNational professional events:\nNational amateur events:\nMinnesota amateur events:\nMinnesota professional events:"

        "title": "Olympic Games ceremony",
        "text": "The Olympic Games ceremonies of the Ancient Olympic Games were an integral part of these Games; the modern Olympic games have opening, closing, and medal ceremonies. Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies date back to the Ancient Games from which the Modern Olympics draw their ancestry. An example of this is the prominence of Greece in both the opening and closing ceremonies. During the 2004 Games, the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an olive wreath. The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter, and cannot be changed by the host nation. This requirement of seeking the approval of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) includes the artistic portion of opening and closing ceremonies.\nThe ceremonies have evolved over the centuries. Ancient Games incorporated ceremonies to mark the beginning and ending of each successive game. There are similarities and differences between the ancient Olympic ceremonies and their modern counterparts. While the presentation of the Games has evolved with improvements in technology and the desire of the host nations to showcase their own artistic expression, the basic events of each ceremony have remained unchanged. The presentation of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies continue to increase in scope, scale, and expense with each successive celebration of the Games, but they are still steeped in tradition.\nAncient forerunners.\nThe Ancient Games, held in Greece from ca. 776 BC to ca. 393 AD, provide the first examples of Olympic ceremonies. The victory celebration, elements of which are in evidence in the modern-day medal and closing ceremonies, often involved elaborate feasts, drinking, singing, and the recitation of poetry. The wealthier the victor, the more extravagant the celebration. The victors were presented with an olive wreath or crown harvested from a special tree in Olympia by a boy, specially selected for this purpose, using a golden sickle. The festival would conclude with the victors making solemn vows and performing ritual sacrifices to the various gods to which they were beholden.\nThere is evidence of dramatic changes in the format of the Ancient Games over the nearly 12 centuries that they were celebrated. Eventually, by roughly the 77th Olympiad, a standard 18-event program was established. In order to open a Games in ancient Greece the organizers would hold an Inauguration Festival. This was followed by a ceremony in which athletes took an oath of sportsmanship. The first competition, an artistic competition of trumpeters and heralds, concluded the opening festivities.\nOpening.\nThe Olympic opening ceremony represents the official commencement of an Olympic Games and the end of the current Olympic cycle. Due to the tight schedule of the Games, it is normal for some sports to start between two or three days before the opening ceremony. For example, the football competitions for both men and women at the 2008 Summer Olympics began two days prior to the opening ceremony.\nThis same situation happens with the Winter Games, where in some editions the ice hockey tournament also starts on the eve of the opening ceremony. \nAs mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the Opening Ceremony of a celebration of the Olympic Games. Most of these rituals were canonized at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.\nTickets.\nNormally, it is common for tickets for the opening ceremony to be the most expensive and most sought before the Games. Exceptionally, this did not happened during the 2020 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics as the Games where held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic strict protocols, the event took place with only some invited guests present at the Olympic Stadiums.\nTime of day.\nSince the 1996 Summer Olympics, the opening ceremonies have to be held on a Friday evening. The first time that opening ceremonies were held in the evening at the host city were during the 1980 Summer Olympics when the ceremonies ended during the when the sun began to set in Moscow. Eight years after, to facilitate a live, prime time broadcast on Friday night in the Americas, the 1988 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Seoul, South Korea was held in the local morning time, a move that faced criticism from athletes due to the excessive heat. Generally, no competition is scheduled on the day of the opening ceremony; between 1992 and 2020 this practice was codified in the Olympic Charter.However, this rule was not followed several times, due to the tight calendar of the event and the preliminaries of some longer events to be held before the opening ceremony. However, no finals should be held before the ceremony. The most recent example of this situation took place during the 2022 Winter Olympics when the curling mixed doubles event preliminaries first rounds were held during morning and the afternoon during the opening ceremonies day.\nThe last opening ceremony held during the daytime hours was that of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Initially conceived to be held at night.The demands made by CBS, which held the broadcast rights for the United States, the ceremony was relocated to start at 11 am local and coincide with its primetime in New York. However, these changes facilitated the grand finale when for the first time on history featured a live and synchronized performance held by six international choirs, linked to the venue via satellite.\nArtistic programme.\nThe artistic programme is what creates the idiosyncratic element of each ceremony. Coubertin's initial vision of the Modern Olympics featured both athletic competitions and artistic achievements. As the modern Olympics have evolved into a celebration of sport, it is in the opening ceremony that one can see the most of Coubertin's ideal. The Opening Ceremony is one of important rituals of the Modern Olympic games that represent a wide variety of features such as similar qualities and messages that link together local and global issues, as well as cultural similarities at the same scopes.\nThe artistic program of the ceremonies allows the host country to showcase its past, present and future in a comprehensive way. All protocols, artistic presentations, elements and rituals must be approved by the IOC Executive Board within 90 days before the event and in specific cases the order of the precedence of events could change. At the current Olympic protocol rules, ceremonies typically start with the authorities presentation which includes the entrance of the head of state or representative of the host country and the president of the International Olympic Committee followed by the raising of the country's flag and the performance of the national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture, history, and the current Olympic game motto. Since the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, the artistic presentations have continued to grow in scale and complexity. The 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, for example, reportedly cost US$100 million, with much of the cost incurring in the artistic portion.\nEach Opening Ceremony has a theme selected by the host nation and have to be connected with the cultural program of that edition. During all the acts and elements of the ceremonies, the host country's goal is to represent their cultural identity. For example, in the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing, the theme was \"Unity in China\". As on 12 May 2008, only four months before the 2008 games, a devastating earthquake occurred in Sichuan. Chinese basketball legend Yao Ming was chosen to be the host country flagbearer, walking hand-in-hand on entering the stadium with Lin Hao, a nine-year-old boy who saved some of his classmates following the earthquake.\nParade of Nations.\nA traditional part of the opening ceremony starts with a \"Parade of Nations\", during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, delegation-by-delegation. It is not compulsory for athletes to participate in the opening ceremony. Some events of the Games may start on the day before, on the day or the day after the ceremony; athletes competing in these early events may elect not to participate. Each delegation is led by a sign with the name of their nation or team, and by their flagbearer–typically a notable athlete of the delegation. As an act of gender equality, beginning in 2020 the IOC has allowed teams the option of having both a male and female flagbearer.\nSince the 1928 Summer Olympics, Greece has traditionally entered first and leads the parade in honour of their role in the ancient Olympic Games, while the host nation has entered last. The 2004 opening ceremony provided a relaxtion of this practice due to the Games being hosted by Greece; its flagbearer Pyrros Dimas led the parade on his own followed by Saint Lucia, while the rest of the Greek team entered last. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Olympics, the Refugee Olympic Team enters second after Greece, while the host nations of the next two Olympics enter in descending order as the final two teams before the host nation (in this case, the United States, France, and Japan were the final three countries, as hosts of the 2028, 2024, and 2020 Games).\nThe remaining delegations enter after Greece and before the host nation in alphabetical order, based on their name in the host nation's official language. For example, the three Olympics held in Canada have used either English or French (as both are considered official languages of Canada). While in the 1976 Summer Olympics held in Montreal, the National Olympic Committees entered respecting the French language protocol order, as the french is the first language at the city. This was reversed at the 1988 and 2010 Winter Games when English is the primary language in Calgary and Vancouver, while the 1980 Summer Games, 1984 Winter Games and 2014 Winter Games used Cyrillic, and the 2004 Summer Games used Modern Greek script.\nHost nations whose official languages do not use Latin script — especially Games held in Asia — have used different collation methods for the Parade of Nations. The 1988 Summer Olympics and the 2018 Winter Olympics were sorted by traditional Korean Hangul script, while the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics held in Beijing sorted by the number of strokes used to write their name using Simplified Chinese characters, and the 2020 Summer Olympics used the Gojūon ordering of Japanese kana.\nThere have been exceptions to this practice; in the 1964 Summer Olympics, the 1972 Winter Olympics and in the 1998 Winter Olympics the Japanese organizers decided to use the English language protocol order, as due to the Japanese grammar in use, certain IOC protocol rules would be broken, among this was seen a goodwill signal by the Japanese society. National and internal questions led Spain to use the same rule during 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, due to the Catalan independence movement, and concerns over the Spanish language being given undue prominence over the Catalan language, all official announcements during the Games were conducted in French, Spanish, Catalan, and English (with the order of the latter three languages interspersed), and the Parade of Nations was performed based on their French names.\nThe organising committee for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris announced plans for its Parade of Nations to be conducted as a boat parade on the Seine river (with cultural presentations staged along the route), as part of their goals for the opening ceremony to be a public, non-ticketed event rather than be held in a traditional stadium setting. The plans call for the official protocol to take place at the Trocadéro.\nOpening Protocols.\nAfter all nations have entered, the President of the Organizing Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president. At the end of his speech, he introduces the representative or head of state of the host country who officially declares the opening of the Games. Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Olympic Charter presently requires the opener to be the host country's head of state. However, there have been many cases where someone other than the host country's head of state opened the Games. The first example was at the Games of the II Olympiad in Paris in 1900, which had no opening ceremony before as part of the 1900 World's Fair. There are five examples from the United States alone in which the Games were not opened by the head of state.\nThe Olympic Charter provides that the person designated to open the Games should do so by reciting whichever of the following lines is appropriate:\nBefore 1936, the opening official would often make a short welcoming speech before declaring the Games open. However, since 1936, when Adolf Hitler opened both the Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics and the Berlin Summer Olympics, the openers have used the standard formula.\nThere have been ten times the official has modified the wording of the said opening line. Recent editions of the Winter Games have seen a trend of using the first version instead of the second, which happened in the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Winter Games. Other modifications include:\nNext, the Olympic flag is carried horizontally (since the 1960 Summer Olympics) or vertically (when the ceremonies are held indoor) into the stadium and hoisted as the Olympic Hymn is played. The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic flag must \"fly for the entire duration of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium\". At most games, the flag has been carried into the stadium by prominent athletes of the host nation.Following the changes made during the 112th IOC Session held in 2001, there is permission for the Olympic flag to be carried during the opening ceremony by people who are not athletes, but who promote Olympic values. This permission also includes Paralympic athletes.\nFeedback\nUntil the 1988 Summer Olympics, flag bearers of all countries then circle a rostrum, where one athlete of the host nation (since the 1920 Summer Olympics), and one judge of the host nation (since the 1972 Summer Olympics) speak the Olympic Oath, declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules of their respective sport. Since the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, continuing with the tradition started at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics a coach from the host nation speaks out the Olympic Oath. For the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, the three oaths are merged into one as the Unified Oath where one athlete, judge, and coach recite one line of the oath respectively before the athlete finishes it.\nOlympic flame.\nSince the 1992 Summer Olympics,the climax of an opening ceremony is the arrival of the Olympic flame, as the conclusion of the torch relay: the torch is typically passed a group of final torchbearers—typically reflecting the host nation's most prominent Olympic athletes. The final torchbearer(s), in turn, lights a cauldron inside or near the stadium–signifying, in earnest, the beginning of the Games. There have been exceptions to the final torchbearers being prominent sports figures: in 2012, to reflect the Games' slogan \"Inspire a Generation\", the cauldron was lit by a group of seven young athletes, each nominated by a notable British athlete. Due the lack of tradition in Winter Sports, the final torchbearers at the 2022 Winter Olympics reflected the history of China at the sports with athletes from different decades (beginning with the 1950s), the cauldron was lit by two Chinese skiers who was to compete on that Games.\nUnder IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron also should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This rule was first made evident for the first time during the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Vancouver, which was the first held in a closed venue: the BC Place — then a domed, indoor stadium. While a scenic cauldron was jointly lit by Nancy Greene, Steve Nash, and Wayne Gretzky during the opening ceremony (due to a malfunction, a fourth arm meant to be lit by Catriona Le May Doan did not rise), Gretzky was escorted outside to light a second, public cauldron at Jack Poole Plaza.\nDuring the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the cauldron located inside the Olympic Stadium was not visible from outside of the stadium. The image of the lit cauldron was projected on the stadium's rooftop screens during the first week of competition and when the athletics competions were over at the second week. and a live footage feed was available to broadcasters. \nThe notion of a public cauldron displayed outside of the ceremonies venue, and lit following the opening ceremony, was adopted by several subsequent Olympics since Vancouver, such as 2016 at the Candelária Church plaza, and 2020 in Ariake, Tokyo. The 2022 Winter Olympics had three public cauldrons located, the main outside of the Beijing National Stadium, another one at the Yanqing District, and a one at Zhangjiakou — reflecting the three main zones of the Games' venues.\nDoves.\nBeginning at the post-World War I Summer Olympics of 1920, the lighting of the Olympic flame was followed by the release of doves, symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought newspapers to cover themselves because of the birds' droppings.) The release was discontinued after several doves perched themselves at the cauldron's rim and were burned alive by the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit. These symbolic releases have used a variety of alternatives to actual doves.\nMedal presentation.\nAfter each Olympic event is completed, a medal ceremony is held. The Summer Games usually conduct medal ceremonies immediately after the event at the respective venues. Winter editions, however, would present the medals at a nightly victory ceremony held at a medal plaza, excluding the indoor and specific events. This is because due to the altitude of some Winter events, presenting medals may be difficult in said environments. A three–tiered rostrum is used for the three medal winners, with the gold medal winner ascending to the highest platform, in the centre, with the silver and bronze medalists flanking. The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC. The IOC member is usually accompanied by a person from the sports federation governing the sport (such as IAAF in athletics or FINA in swimming), who presents each athlete with a small bouquet of flowers. When the Games were held in Athens in 2004, the medal winners also received olive wreaths in honor of the tradition at the Ancient Olympics. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, for the first time in history, the flowers were replaced by a small 3D model of the Games' logo. At the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, the flowers were replaced by a special version of the plush toy of the mascot dressed in historical Korean clothing. After medals are distributed, the flags of the nations of the three medalists are raised. The flag of the gold medalist's country is in the centre and raised the highest while the flag of the silver medalist's country is on the left facing the flags and the flag of the bronze medalist's country is on the right, both at lower elevations than the gold medalist's country's flag. Should there have been multiple athletes tied for gold medal (as it was the case for examples like the two gold medalists for men's high jump at the 2020 Summer Olympics), the national anthems (if from multiple NOCs) will be played in the alphabetical order according to the medalists' surnames.\nThe flags are raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist's country plays. Citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies. They aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag bearers.\nStrict rules govern the conduct of athletes during the medal ceremony. For example, they are required to wear only pre-approved outfits that are standard for the athlete's national Olympic team. They are not allowed to display any political affiliation or make a political statement while on the medal stand. The most famous violation of this rule was the Black Power salute of Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.\nFor their actions, IOC president Avery Brundage demanded their expulsion from the Olympics. After the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) refused to do so, Brundage threatened to remove the entire United States track and field team from the Olympics. Following this, the USOC complied, and Smith and Carlos were expelled.\nAs is customary, since the 2020 Summer Olympics men's and women's marathon medals (at the Summer Olympics) and since the 2014 Winter Olympics, men's 50 km and women's 30 km cross-country skiing medals (at the Winter Olympics) are awarded as part of the Closing Ceremony, which take place on the penultimate and the last days, in the Olympic Stadium, and traditionally are the last medal presentation of the Games.\nClosing.\nTraditionally more relaxed and festive,\nMany elements of the closing ceremony ended up evolving historically through traditions rather than official rules and procedures.\nThe current closing ceremony procedures began with changes approved by the IOC during the 112th IOC Session held in Moscow in 2001 and started at the 2002 Winter Olympics. \nBetween 1896 and 2000 it was common for, in addition to the anthem of the host country, the Greek anthem and the anthem of the next host country to be played in this opening segment.Due changes implemented in 2005.Is common that the closing ceremony begins with the authorities presentation followed by the raising of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem, followed by an artistic program. \nBecause of its flexibility, it is common for the duration to be shorter than the opening ceremonies.\nUsually,the protocolar part of the closing ceremony starts with the \"Parade of Nations\", where flag bearers from each participating country enter at the main entrance to the stadium field. Since the 2002 Winter Olympics.It is up to the Organizing Committee to make the decision whether or not the athletes will enter the protocol order\nthe protocolar order used during the opening ceremonies.The only requirement is that the Greek flag leads the parade and that of the host country is last. An example of this flexibility in this rule occurred at the 2012 Summer Olympics, when during the closing, the flags of Great Britain as host country and Brazil as the next host entered together at the end of this segment.⁸If the circumstances permits them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. This \"Parade of Athletes,\" the blending of all the athletes, is a tradition that began during the 1956 Summer Olympics at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy John Ian Wing, who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as \"one nation.\" Prior to the 1956 Summer Games, no Olympic Team had ever marched in the closing ceremony of the Modern or the Ancient Games. It was the very first International Peace March ever to be staged.\nStarting at the 2000 Summer Olympics,after all the flags and athletes enter the stadium, the final medal ceremony of the Games is held. The organizing committee of the respective host city, could, consulting with the IOC, determines which event will have its medals presented. During the Summer Olympics, this place is reservated for the men's marathon awarding ceremonies (starting in 2020 Summer Olympics the women's marathon had to be their awarding ceremonies also during the closing) Traditionally, the men's marathon is held in the last day of competitions, and the race is finished some hours before the start of the closing ceremony. However, in recent Summer Olympiads in Atlanta, Beijing, Rio and Tokyo (although 2020's marathons were held in Sapporo, 500 miles or near 1.200km away) staged the men's and women's marathon in the early morning hours due the climate conditions in the host city.This tradition was adapted for the Winter Games starting in the 2006 Winter Olympics, the medals for the men's 50 km cross-country skiing event and starting on 2014 the woman's 30 km cross-country skiing event were presented at the closing ceremony.\nAnother obligatory moment is when the newly elected members of the IOC Athletes' Commission then present a bouquet of flowers to a representative of the volunteers, as a thank-you to them for their work during the Games.\nAfter changes held during the 2006 Winter Olympics,the Antwerp ceremony starts with two another national flags hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: first, on one of the masts located at the rostrum tip the flag of Greece to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games is played first, and since the immediately the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. \"Hymn to Liberty\", the national anthem of Greece, has been performed at every closing ceremony of the Olympic Games since the current rules were adopted..This protocol segment won more highlight during the closing ceremonies of the 1980 Summer Olympics, as the United States was scheduled to host the next Summer Olympics,was the time of the American anthem being played while its flag was raised,the flag of Los Angeles was raised with the Olympic Anthem played instead The Star-Spangled Banner as consequence of the constraints who led to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. In Sydney and Athens, two Greek flags were raised because Greece was hosting the 2004 games.\nThen, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremony is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.\nIn what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony (because the tradition began at the Antwerp Games), the current mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the official Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the current mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games. The receiving mayor then waves the flag eight times. During the ceremony, the mayor of the current host city stands on the left, the president of the IOC stands in the middle, and the mayor of the next host city stands on the right. Until the 1984 Summer Olympic Games this ceremony was held during the Opening Ceremonies. During the Modern Olympic history five protocolar flags are used:\nThis portion of the ceremony actually took place at the opening ceremony until the 1984 Summer Games and the 1988 Winter Games.\nThe next host city then introduces itself with a cultural presentation. This tradition began with the 1976 Summer Olympics.and was modernized several times until the recent rules were applied in 2020. \nAfterwards, the President of the Organizing Committee makes a speech. The IOC President then makes a speech before closing the Olympics by saying:\"And now, I declare the Games of the [ordinal number of Summer Olympics] Olympiad/[ordinal number of Winter Olympics] Olympic Winter Games closed; and in accordance with our tradition, I call upon the youth of the world to assemble, four\" \"years from now, in [name of next host city] to celebrate with us; the Games of the [subsequent ordinal number of Summer Olympics] Olympiad/[subsequent ordinal number of Winter Olympics] Olympic Winter Games\".If the next Olympic Games is not scheduled for four years after the current one, the IOC president will instead reference the different timeframe. For instance, the 2020 Summer Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so IOC President Thomas Bach instead stated \"I call upon the youth of the world to assemble, three years from now, in Paris.\" A similar situation occurred at the 1992 Winter Olympics, which were held only two years before the next Winter Olympics in 1994 so that the Summer and Winter Games would be in different years moving forward. Unlike the opening ceremony, the head of state or representative of the host country does not give a speech at the closing ceremony.\nFinally, the Olympic cauldron is extinguished, marking the end of the current Games and the start of a new cycle.\nFollowing the conclusion of the ceremony protocol, it is not uncommon for the ceremony to continue on with an \"afterparty\" of concert performances as a finale; the 2010 Winter Games closing ceremony featured various Canadian musicians, the 2012 Summer Games closing ceremony featured a portait of the british modern music with performances held by Pet Shop Boys, One Direction, Jessie J, the Spice Girls and The Who, the 2016 closing ceremony featured a tribute to the Rio Carnival, and the 2018 Winter Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies were focused on the Korean Wave movement. The IOC also added a performance by the french DJ Martin Garrix."

Portugal, Ireland, and the Netherlands were clearly the top sides in the group, each handing out six beatings to the three other minnows.

        "text": "Horatio Stanley Williams (2 November 1886 – 30 April 1936) was a Welsh rugby union fullback who played club rugby for Newport. He won 4 caps for England and was selected for the British Lions 1910 tour of South Africa, in which he played in all three test games.\nRugby career.\nWilliams first played for Newport in 1901 and was part of the team that faced the touring 1908 Australians. Whilst with Newport he had several trials with Wales and was at one stage selected as a reserve for the team, but was never officially selected to represent his birth country. In 1910 Williams was one of five Newport players chosen to represent the British Isles on their tour of South Africa. Williams played in all three test matches.\nWhen the English rugby union invoked Newport's rugby union membership Williams switched his international allegiance to England. Williams was first capped for England on 21 January 1911 when he played against Wales at St Helens. England lost the match 11–15, but in the second game of the Championship Williams finished on the winning side when the English team crushed France 37–0. Williams played in the next two games for England when they lost in tight game to Ireland and beat Scotland to leave them with the Wooden Spoon.\nInternational matches played.\nEngland\nBritish Isles\nLater life.\nWilliams served his country during World War I, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions during the conflict.\nIn 1936, on a return trip from Rio de Janeiro to Southampton on the Royal Mail ship \"Arlanza\", Williams fell overboard and was declared lost.\nHis daughter, Christine Stanley Williams, who accompanied him on the trip on the \"Arlanza\", married Sir David Peel Yates."

        "title": "County Championship (rugby union)",
        "text": "The County Championship is an annual rugby union competition in England between teams representing English counties. After restructuring in 2007 the top tier of the Championship has been known as the Bill Beaumont Cup, after the trophy awarded to the competition winners was named in honour of Bill Beaumont, a former England and British &amp; Irish Lions captain. In 2017 the competition was officially known as Bill Beaumont Division 1, with teams also competing in Division 2 and Division 3, which prior to 2017 were known as the Plate and Shield competitions.\nThe Championship has a long history, being first officially recognised by the Rugby Football Union in 1889. The 2018 Championship was the 118th competition. The most successful county, Lancashire, has won the competition 25 times, followed by Gloucestershire (17) and Yorkshire (15). Lancashire (34) &amp; Gloucestershire (33) have made the most appearances in contested finals.\nOn four occasions the tournament final has been tied at full-time and a second leg rematch has been played. Two of these rematches were also tied and on these occasions (1907 and 1967) the finalists were declared joint winners. In 1991 the final match between Cornwall and Yorkshire was tied at full-time and extra time was played, with Cornwall winning 29–20.\nIn 2001 the Championship did not take place due to the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak; instead Yorkshire and Cornwall were invited to play at Twickenham.\nThe 2015 final was contested by Lancashire and Cornwall, with the teams meeting in the final for the third consecutive year. Cornwall won the championship with an 18-13 victory, their fourth title overall and their first since 1999. Cornwall retained their title in 2016, this time beating Cheshire, 35–13. In 2017 Cornwall and Lancashire met in the final for the fourth time in five seasons. Lancashire won 19-8 and prevented Cornwall from completing a hat-trick of county titles.\nStructure.\nThere was little formal structure to the first official years of the competition, with teams playing different numbers of matches and different opposition from across England. The winners were determined by a panel of judges from the RFU Committee. From 1891–1895, the four winners of four regional Championships (North East, North West, South East and South West) played a round-robin tournament to determine the overall winner of the County Championship.\nA restructure in 1896, led to the creation of North and South regions only, the winners of these regional competitions playing a final for the County Championship. Another restructure in 1921 saw the formation of five regions and the knock-out stage of the championship extend to semi-finals and a final. The winners of the North East, North West and South East regions were entered into a semi-final draw along with the winners of a play-off between the winners of the South and South West regions.\nFrom 2007 to 2016, the top eight counties were split into two regions of four teams, North and South, who played a round-robin tournament. The winners of each region competed for the English County Championship in the final. This format was repeated for the eight counties that competed for the County Championship Plate. The eleven counties which competed for the County Championship Shield were split into three pools from which the winners and the runner-up with the best record met in semi-final matches.\nIn 2017 the competition was given a new structure, with the top tier comprising twelve teams and the second and third tiers having eight teams each. Each tier has a final each year, but promotion and relegation between tiers is decided on a two-year basis.\nPast winners.\n1984-present.\nSince 1984 all Championship finals have been played at Twickenham .\nChampionships by county.\n\"Correct as of 10 July 2023\"\nCumbria, a 1974 amalgamation of the former counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and the Furness part of Lancashire, is shown separately from Cumberland and Lancashire.\n\"Eastern Counties\" and \"Notts, Lincs &amp; Derby\" have reached the final, but have never won the championship.\nGloucestershire are the only county to have completed a \"hat-trick of hat-trick\" of county titles: this was achieved in 1920-1922, 1930-1932 and 1974-1976.\nJohn Fidler, former Gloucester, Gloucestershire and England lock forward, still holds the record for the most County Championship Final appearances, nine in all, from 1971 to 1984."

        "text": "The Indian Open, titled for sponsorship reasons as the Hero Indian Open since 2011, is the national open golf championship of India, organised by the Indian Golf Union. Founded in 1964, it was added to the Asia Golf Circuit schedule in 1970. In 1998 it became an event on the rival Omega Tour (known as the Asian Tour since 2004). Since 2015, it has also been co-sanctioned by the European Tour.\nFrom 1964 until 2000, the tournament was held exclusively at either Delhi Golf Club or Royal Calcutta Golf Club. Since then it has been held at Classic Golf Resort in 2000 and 2001, Karnataka Golf Association in 2012, and DLF Golf and Country Club in 2009 and since 2017; all other editions have been held at Delhi Golf Club.\nHistory.\nThe inaugural event was held in February 1964. Peter Thomson beat Ralph Moffitt by four strokes. Thomson was the inspiration behind the event. He used to stop off in India while travelling worldwide to play and soon realised the potential for golf and that the best way to promote it would be an international tournament. It was this insight that persuaded the Indian Golf Union to establish the Indian Open. Thompson continued to play in the event and won again in 1966 and 1976. His three wins was equalled by Jyoti Randhawa in 2007. \nThe second event in 1965 was won by Indian amateur Prem Gopal (Billoo) Sethi, who beat Guy Wolstenholme by seven strokes. Sethi still remains the only amateur winner. It was not until 1991, when Ali Sher became champion, that India had another winner.\nIn 1970 the Indian Open became part of the Asia Golf Circuit; it had been an \"associate event\" on the circuit in 1967 and 1968. As a result of joining the tour, the field increased in strength with notable winners including three-time major champion Payne Stewart.\nThere have been a number of sponsors over the years, with Hero Honda Motors Ltd taking over sponsorship in 2005. The prize fund for 2017 was US$1.75 million.\nNo events took place in 2020, 2021 and 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVenues.\nThe following venues have been used since the founding of the Indian Open in 1964.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "text": "David Myers (31 July 1971 – 20 October 2008) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s. He played as a reserve at representative level for Great Britain in non-Test matches on the 1992 tour of Papua New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand, and at club level for Widnes (two spells), Warrington, Wigan, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Bradford Bulls, Western Suburbs Magpies and Salford City Reds, as a .\nBackground.\nDavid Myers was born in Widnes, Cheshire, England on 31 July 1971. He played junior rugby league for Blackbrook before turning professional, joining Widnes in August 1988.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nMyers made his senior debut for Widnes in February 1989, scoring a hat trick against Oldham. He made eight appearances for the club during the 1988–89 season.\nIn August 1989, Myers was the subject of a contract dispute between Widnes and Warrington, with both clubs claiming they had signed the player. The Rugby Football League ruled in favour of Warrington, with an independent tribunal setting the transfer fee at an initial £35,000, potentially rising to £80,000 depending on future appearances. Myers made six appearances for Warrington during the 1989–90 season, but was transfer listed in February 1990 after failing to impress at the club.\nWigan.\nMyers joined Wigan, scoring a try on his debut against Sheffield Eagles in September 1990. He played and scored in Wigan's 13–8 victory over St Helens in the 1991 Challenge Cup Final during the 1990–91 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 27 April 1991, and played when Joe Lydon missed the game due to injury, and scored a try in the defending champions Wigan's 21-4 victory over the visiting Penrith Panthers in the 1991 World Club Challenge during the 1991–92 season at Anfield, Liverpool on Wednesday 2 October 1991, Shaun Edwards intercepting in his own half and giving the ball to Myers a few yards from the try line. Myers had been picked ahead of Mark Preston by coach John Monie, but ended scoring only half the amount of tries Preston had. \nFollowing the arrival of Martin Offiah, Myers was dropped at Wigan, but was nevertheless selected during the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand as a replacement for injured players but failed to play in any significant games. \nLater career.\nIn October 1992, Myers was sold to Widnes in an exchange deal which saw Paul Atcheson join Wigan from Widnes. He continued by losing in the Challenge Cup with his new team, Myers played on the , in Widnes' 14-20 defeat by Wigan in the 1993 Challenge Cup Final during the 1992–93 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 1 May 1993.\nIn 1994, Myers was signed by Bradford Northern for an undisclosed fee.\nMyers switched codes to rugby union later in his career, representing Widnes RUFC. He eventually moved into coaching, and was the assistant coach at Bowdon Rugby Club at the time of his death.\nDeath.\nMyers died aged 37 in a car accident on the M6 motorway in Sandbach, Cheshire, England. It was confirmed in a coroner's report that Myers was using steroids and amphetamines whilst driving, and died of a heart attack, although the report also concluded that the two drugs had contributed to this."

        "text": "Herbert John Solomon (15 October 1929 – 18 March 2020) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative versatile back who captained the Wallabies in eight Tests in the 1950s and led the touring squads to New Zealand and South Africa.\nEarly life and university.\nEducated at Coogee Prep School and then The Scots College in Sydney, Solomon started his club rugby at the University rugby club when he commenced his medical studies at St Andrew's College at Sydney University in 1948. He won University \"blues\" in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951.\nAustralian representative.\nHe made his state and national representative debuts at age nineteen, first playing for Australia against the at the Sydney Cricket Ground in June 1949. Later that year he toured New Zealand with Trevor Allan's Bledisloe Cup winning Wallabies. Solomon played variously at five-eighth, fullback and centre in seven matches of the tour including the 2nd Test at Eden Park where he scored a try thus helping the side make history as the first Australian team to win the Cup in New Zealand.\nHe played twice for New South Wales in 1950 against the visiting British and Irish Lions and as five-eighth for Australia in both Tests of the tour. He was in the centres in the second Waratahs match against the Lions who up till that point of their tour were undefeated. Solomon held his own against the world-class opposition of Bleddyn Williams and Lewis Jones.\nIn 1951 Solomon played against the visiting All Blacks in two Tests and with the Waratahs. The selectors experimented with Keith Winning and Colin Windon as captain and then in 1952 when Australia hosted the exciting Fijians, Solomon was honoured with the national captaincy aged just twenty-two. Fiji had not previously played against Australia and had only competed at the world-class level against New Zealand in 1939. Solomon made an outstanding debut as captain on this historic occasion. He played at inside-centre and clinched the first Test for Australia when he dived over for a try six minutes from the end. The Fijians won the 2nd Test but in the process earned the respect of the Australian rugby public who delighted in the spectacular running and carefree play of the Fijians who would wrestle the ball at every opportunity and who employed long, one-handed and sometimes reckless passing.\n Australia then undertook a ten matches tour of New Zealand for which Solomon was chosen as captain with tour manager the 1927 Waratah, Jock Blackwood. Solomon's Wallabies won eight of the ten games including one Test victory and one Test loss. Solomon scored three tries in the nine matches in which he played, captaining his country in all.\nIn 1953 Solomon was again appointed captain for the arduous Wallaby tour of South Africa. Wylie Breckenbridge and Johnnie Wallace were the management team but Wallace took ill and many organisational and coaching responsibilities fell to Solomon. He himself was ill for the first three games but recovered to play in 14 of the 27 tour matches including three Tests. In the 2nd Test Australia were trailing 14–8 when Solomon had to leave the field with a knee injury. He recovered to feature in a back-line play that saw Brian Johnson score in the corner and Eddie Stapleton boot the conversion from out wide to take the score to 14–13. From the kick-off another enterprising running back-line play saw Solomon play a role which culminated in winger Garth Jones scoring under the posts to enable a Wallaby victory. In a surprise gesture fitting the rarity in those days of the South Africa being beaten at home, the Boks forwards chaired Solomon from the field.\nFollowing the South African tour, Solomon took a year out to attend to his medical studies but returned in 1955 to captain the Wallabies to New Zealand with Wylie Breckenbridge as manager and Bill Cerutti as assistant manager/coach. Solomon only played in six of the thirteen games suffering a dislocated shoulder against a Canterbury/Otago side which marked the end of his representative career. He later coached at the university club as well as the Australian national side.\nAccolades and honours.\nHis 1953 South African tour teammate Sir Nicholas Shehadie described him as follows: \"Quick enough to play centre or wing, equipped with a skilful swerve and sharp acceleration when a gap appeared. Much admired for his astute captaincy\".\nHe was inducted into the Australian Rugby Hall of Fame in 2016."

With the win, Penn State won its fourth overall title, and became the first team in the history of women's intercollegiate volleyball to win three straight national titles. Penn State also became the first team in NCAA history to have two straight undefeated seasons, as the 2009 squad went 38-0 for the second straight year, extending the ongoing NCAA record of consecutive matches won (102).\nPenn State became only the third team in NCAA history to win the national championship after trailing 0-2 in sets. The last team to accomplish the feat was UCLA in 1991.\nPenn State's senior class, led by Megan Hodge and Alisha Glass, had an overall record of 142-5 (.966 winning %), which is the best winning percentage in NCAA Division I history for classes that have won national titles. Penn State hit .381 for the season, the second-best Division I team hitting percentage mark in the rally scoring era. It only trails the mark of .390 set by the 2008 Penn State squad.\nTexas's Destinee Hooker, the Most Outstanding Player of the 2009 Final Four, broke the record of kills in an NCAA championship match, as she had a career high 34 kills in the final.\nGainesville Regional.\nGainesville all-tournament team\nMegan Hodge Penn State (MVP)\nKelly Murphy Florida\nCallie Rivers Florida\nBlair Brown Penn State\nDarcy Dorton Penn State\nAlisha Glass Penn State\nArielle Wilson Penn State\nStanford Regional.\nStanford region all-tournament team\nKanani Danielson Hawaii (MVP)\nAmber Kaufman Hawaii\nStephanie Ferrell Hawaii\nAlex Hunt Michigan\nLexi Zimmerman Michigan\nAlix Klineman Stanford\nCassidy Lichtman Stanford\nMinneapolis Regional.\nMinneapolis region all-tournament team\nHailey Cowles Minnesota (MVP)\nMira Djuric Florida State\nRachael Morgan Florida State\nStephanie Neville Florida State\nTaylor Carico Minnesota\nLauren Gibbemeyer Minnesota\nChristine Tan Minnesota\nOmaha Regional.\nOmaha region all-tournament team\nDestinee Hooker Texas (MVP)\nRachael Hockaday Iowa State\nKayla Banwarth Nebraska\nLindsey Licht Nebraska\nAshley Engle Texas\nJulianne Faucette Texas\nHeather Kisner Texas"

The first offshore leg of the 2008–09 Race started in Alicante, Spain, on 11 October 2008, with the in-port race having been held seven days earlier. A total of ten legs created the route, with seven in-port (IP) races held at various cities around the world. Unlike previous editions, the route crossed the Strait of Malacca at the Malay Archipelago, instead of Cape Leeuwin south of Australia. The boats covered in the course of their journey. The chief executive of the 2008–09 race was Knut Frostad.\nOn 15 June 2009, \"Ericsson 4\", skippered by Torben Grael, finished third on leg 9 from Marstrand to Stockholm, Sweden. With their third-place finish, they were able to secure overall victory.\n \"Ericsson 4\" covered the of the race in a time of 127 days, 7 hours, 46 minutes, 21 seconds. Ericsson 4 completed the race with 114 ½ points, whilst Puma ended with 105 ½. \nPrincipal race officer, Bill O'Hara, described the Kochi race as a \"memorable\" port but Galway was the best.\nParticipants.\nBudgets.\nEricsson's budgets were €50 million, whilst Puma's budget was approximately €20 million. By comparison, the joint Irish and Chinese team, Green Dragon, received €8 million from the Irish government and €4 million from China.\nRoute.\nSummary.\nThe route also included seven ‘scoring gates’ (at Fernando de Noronha, Mauritius, Pulau Weh, Indonesia, Latitude 36S, Cape Horn, Fernando de Noronha and St John's, Newfoundland). Yachts scored 'half-points' at these gates, the same as for the in port races.\nStopovers.\nCape Town.\nEricsson 4 won leg one of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Alicante, Spain, to Cape Town in South Africa in a time of 21 days, 17 hours and 54 minutes.\nKochi.\nThe second leg of began on 15 November 2008, with the sailors avoiding pirates off the coast of Somalia on their way to India.\nSingapore.\nTelefonica Blue won leg three of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Kochi, India, to Singapore in Singapore. Puma Ocean Racing finished in second place, whilst Ericsson 3 and Ericsson 4 finished in third and fourth places respectively. The race was described as very close, with the top four boats finishing the race within twenty minutes of each other. The race took ten days to complete, ending on 22 December 2008.\nQingdao.\nTelefonica Blue won leg four of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Singapore in Singapore to Qingdao, China. Puma Ocean Racing finished in second place, whilst Ericsson 4 finished in third place. Telefonica Black, Ericsson 3 and Delta Lloyd all withdrew to sail to the Philippines and Taiwan for repairs. The leg lasted from 18 January until 29 January 2009.\nRio de Janeiro.\nEricsson 3 won leg five, the longest leg at , of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Qingdao in China to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, in a time of 40 days and five hours, arriving on 26 March 2009.\nThe teams left for Boston in the United States on leg five, which began on 11 April 2009.\nBoston.\nThe boats arrived in Boston in late April, with an in port race on 9 May.\nLeg 6 was won by Ericsson 4 at 21:05 GMT, 26 April 2009 after 15 days, 10 hours and 31 minutes of sailing\nGalway.\nEricsson 4 won leg seven of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Boston in the United States to Galway, crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a time of seven days, 10 hours, 33 minutes and 51 seconds. Puma Ocean Racing finished in second place, one hour behind. Green Dragon finished in third position, whilst Telefonica Blue finished in fourth place.\nFáilte Ireland West sponsored the two-week Galway Stopover. It was expected that 140,000 people would visit Galway during the Stopover but the final total significantly outnumbered half a million, with some early reports suggesting that over 600,000 people had come to Galway to view the boats. €43 million was the economic total predicted for Galway from the events but the final total was anticipated to be over €80 million. Figures released the following November suggested the total was just under €56 million. The atmosphere and support in Galway was described positively.\nAt least 50,000 people watched the seven yachts leave Galway on Leg 8 of the race. Irish President Mary McAleese made a public speech before the sailors took off, noting their \"extraordinary skill and resilience\" which had \"inspired all of us\". Liu Biwei, China's ambassador to Ireland, spoke of how he favoured the Irish-Chinese pairing, and the fleet received several blessings. The sailors reported of the enjoyment they had in Galway, with Puma skipper Ken Read describing it as \"the best stopover I have ever been involved with\" saying he would return the following year after enjoying his time on the golf course and declaring that there was \"something about Ireland and myself that seem to like each other\".\nGalway is expected to compete again for a stopover during the next race, with other Irish destinations such as Belfast and Dún Laoghaire expected to compete also.\nMarstrand.\nEricsson 4 won leg eight of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Galway to Marstrand in Sweden in a time of 12 hours and 57 minutes, their third consecutive victory and fifth overall Puma finished in second place and Green Dragon finished in third place. It was Green Dragon's second successive podium finish and, although they finished third, they had led for most of the race.\nThe boats left Galway Bay, journeying southward along the west coast of Ireland. They then travelled in a south-easterly direction across the Irish Sea to south England, moving in an eastwards direction up the English Channel. The teams then travelled up into the North Sea until arrival at the Baltic Sea.\nStockholm.\nPuma won leg nine of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Marstrand to Stockholm in Sweden, their first win in the race. The third place for Ericsson 4 was enough for the team to also win the overall race at this point, leading to comparisons with the victor of the previous race, Mike Sanderson and ABN AMRO One, who won at the end of leg seven in Portsmouth, England, in 2006.\nSaint Petersburg.\nTelefonica Black won the last leg of the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race from Stockholm to Saint Petersburg, covering the in a time of 1 day, 12 hours and 41 minutes. Puma Ocean Racing had led the race for most of the way. Ericsson 4, finished in third place.\nStealth play.\nThis race featured \"Stealth play\", a tactic that allowed a crew to hide its position from its competitors for a period of 12 hours. It was designed to add a tactical dimension to the race, whereby a team might opt to make a break from the fleet without the rest of the competitors knowing what they are doing and where they are on the race track. The ploy can first be used on leg one, leg two, leg five, leg six and leg seven. If it is not used on one leg, it cannot be accumulated for use on a following leg.\nOverall Results.\n – Telefónica Blue were penalised 3 points from their overall score for a rudder change after Leg 4.\n – Telefónica Black were penalised 3 points from their overall score for a rudder change after Leg 1.\nRecords.\nDuring Leg 1 \"Ericsson 4\", skippered by Torben Grael, broke the monohull 24 hour distance record when he sailed , an average of ."

They were also allowed to have more sail area and include the use of canting keels.\nDuring Leg 7 of the race, Hans Horrevoets, 32, of the Netherlands was swept overboard from \"ABN AMRO II\". Although he was recovered from the water, attempts to resuscitate him were not successful.

Although a search was carried out for the yacht, it is believed she sank due to the damage sustained.\nThe 2005–06 race had tighter restrictions on the number of crewmembers allowed than previous races. An all-male crew was restricted to ten, while a crew with at least 5 women could have eleven members, and an all-female crew, (of which there were none in the race), could have twelve. The only woman who served as crew was Adrienne Cahalan of \"Brasil 1\", who was replaced after the first leg.

        "text": "Portmarnock Golf Club is a links golf club in Portmarnock, County Dublin, Ireland, located close to Dublin Airport.\nThe golf course is often rated as one of the top courses in the UK and Ireland and is also often included in lists of the top 100 golf courses in the world.\nHistory.\nOn Christmas Eve 1893, an insurance broker named W. C. Pickeman and his friend George Ross rowed over from Sutton to Portmarnock peninsula to explore the possibility of creating a golf links. The peninsula is about two miles long and covers over 500 acres. The course opened on Saint Stephen's Day 1894 with nine holes. It was extended to eighteen holes in 1896 with a new clubhouse and a further nine holes were added in 1971. The championship course follows the original layout although considerably lengthened (over 7,500 yards of the Championship tees). The only major change in the routing was the insertion in 1927 of a new, now famous par three, the 15th hole.\nPortmarnock Golf Club has welcomed some of the greatest players in the world from early greats such as Harry Vardon, Henry Cotton, Bobby Locke, to the first super star of golf, Arnold Palmer. In recent years Pádraig Harrington, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, David Duval, Paul McGinley and Tiger Woods have all played golf on the course.\nNotable events hosted.\nPortmarnock was the venue for the first Irish Open in 1927, and has hosted the tournament on many occasions since, including 13 following its revival in 1975. Many other important golf tournaments have been held at the club, including the British Amateur Championship in 1949 and 2019, the Walker Cup in 1991, and the Canada Cup in 1960. In October 2023 The R&amp;A said that they were \"keen to investigate the possibility\" of Portmarnock hosting the Open Championship or Women's Open Championship.\nDiscrimination claims.\nIn 2003 the Equality Authority of Ireland brought a discrimination case in the Dublin District Court under which the club's drinks licence was suspended for 7 days. The finding was overturned in the High Court in 2005, and again in the Supreme Court in 2009, allowing the club to keep its men-only policy.\nIn 2005, the High Courts decision in the \"Equal Authority v. Portmarnock Golf Club &amp; Ors\" became a significant case in Irish gender equality law. While the authority argued such discrimination could not be protected by Section 9 of the ESA because the club providing a space for golf is not necessarily a “need” of men, the Supreme Court believed it was fair to hold Portmarnock Golf Club as a nondiscriminatory club under the Equal Status Act, ruling the fundamental purpose of the club was golf.\nPortmarnock Golf Club’s men-only policy was legally enforceable due to its exemption under equal status legislation. The reason for this discrimination against women is because the club has claimed their main purpose is to accommodate the needs of only one gender. Section 9 of the Equal Status Act states that clubs whose main purpose is to serve the needs of only one gender may be considered nondiscriminatory. However, Section 8 of the ESA holds that a club will be considered discriminatory if there is anything, such as a rule or practice that exempts a qualified member or an applicant for membership from being a member of the club. In addition, Section 8 claims a club is considered to be discriminatory if there are different terms and conditions of membership for different individuals. Because Section 8 prohibits gender discrimination, Portmarnock was technically a discriminating club under Section 8 of the ESA.\nIn May 2021, Portmarnock ended its men-only membership policy."

        "title": "1998 Major League Baseball expansion",
        "text": "The 1998 Major League Baseball expansion resulted in the establishment of Major League Baseball (MLB)'s 29th and 30th teams beginning play for the 1998 season. After initiating an expansion committee in March 1994, 27 groups representing nine cities submitted bids for the proposed expansion teams. After a yearlong process, on March 9, 1995, the league awarded the National League franchise to Phoenix and the American League franchise to Tampa Bay. The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (currently the Tampa Bay Rays), subsequently began play for the 1998 season.\nHistory.\nWith the successes of the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins following the 1993 expansion, Major League Baseball by 1994 was looking to expand again from 28 to 30 teams. On March 2, 1994, MLB created an expansion committee to evaluate the feasibility of expansion. Although both Phoenix and Tampa Bay were believed to be overwhelming favorites for the franchises, other cities were invited to bid for the proposed franchises. The committee was headed by Boston Red Sox General Partner John Harrington, with others serving on the committee including Bill Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies, Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees, Stanton Cook of the Chicago Cubs, Richard Jacobs of the Cleveland Indians, Stan Kasten of the Atlanta Braves, the president of the National League, Leonard S. Coleman, Jr., and the president of the American League, Bobby Brown.\nBy June, the league announced that all cities with interest in the proposed franchises should submit their intentions by June 24. By June 30, the committee released the nine communities that submitted information to MLB for the proposed franchises. Buffalo, Nashville, Northern Virginia, Orlando, Phoenix, Tampa Bay and Vancouver placed expansion requests. Other cities mentioned as potential expansion locations which did not officially submit an application to the league included Charlotte and Washington.\nAfter whittling down the field to four finalists (Northern Virginia, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa Bay), MLB announced Phoenix and Tampa Bay as the two expansion franchises on March 9, 1995. Announced to begin play for the 1998 season, each ownership group paid a $130 million expansion fee to enter the league. The ownership groups paid $32 million in July 1995, $25 million in July 1996, $40 million in July 1997 and $33 million in November 1997. In addition, the two expansion teams gave away their rights to $5 million from baseball's central fund for each of the five years following expansion (1998–2002).\nThe adding of the 29th and 30th team caused the American League and the National League to have fifteen teams each. Because of the odd number of teams, only seven games could possibly be scheduled in each league on any given day. Thus, one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day. This would have made it difficult for scheduling, in terms of travel days and the need to end the season before October. In order for MLB officials to continue primarily intraleague play, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams, so the decision was made to move one club from the AL Central to the NL Central - it was ultimately then-acting Commissioner Bud Selig (who at the time also owned the Milwaukee Brewers) who agreed to have his own franchise change leagues.\nThe 1998 expansion remains the most recent to be conducted in Major League Baseball. MLB would later reverse the imbalance created by the 1998 expansion when, following the sale of the Houston Astros, the new owners agreed to move their franchise to the American League before the 2013 season. Following that transaction, MLB consequently altered its season structure so as to include interleague play throughout the regular season."

        "title": "Swimming pool",
        "text": "A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply pool, is a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), and may be found as a feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as concrete, natural stone, metal, plastic, composite or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size swimming pool.\nMany health clubs, fitness centers, and private clubs have pools used mostly for exercise or recreation. It is common for municipalities of every size to provide pools for public use. Many of these municipal pools are outdoor pools but indoor pools can also be found in buildings such as natatoriums and leisure centers. Hotels may have pools available for their guests to use at their own leisure. Subdivisions and apartment complexes may also have pools for residents to use. Pools as a feature in hotels are more common in tourist areas or near convention centers. Educational facilities such as high schools and universities sometimes have pools for physical education classes, recreational activities, leisure, and competitive athletics such as swimming teams. Hot tubs and spas are pools filled with water that is heated and then used for relaxation or hydrotherapy. Specially designed swimming pools are also used for diving, water sports, and physical therapy, as well as for the training of lifeguards and astronauts. Swimming pools most commonly use chlorinated water, or salt water, and may be heated or unheated.\nHistory.\nPre-modern.\nThe \"Great Bath\" at the site of Mohenjo-Daro in modern-day Pakistan was most likely the first swimming pool, dug during the 3rd millennium BC. This pool is , is lined with bricks, and was covered with a tar-based sealant.\nAncient Greeks and Romans built artificial pools for athletic training in the palaestras, for nautical games and for military exercises. Roman emperors had private swimming pools in which fish were also kept, hence one of the Latin words for a pool was \"piscina\". The first heated swimming pool was built by Gaius Maecenas in his gardens on the Esquiline Hill of Rome, likely sometime between 38 and 8 BC. Gaius Maecenas was a wealthy imperial advisor to Augustus and considered one of the first patrons of arts.\nAncient Sinhalese built a pair of pools called \"Kuttam Pokuna\" in the kingdom of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, in the 6th century AD. They were decorated with flights of steps, punkalas or pots of abundance, and scroll design.\n19th century.\nSwimming pools became popular in Britain in the mid-19th century. As early as 1837, six indoor pools with diving boards existed in London, England. The Maidstone Swimming Club in Maidstone, Kent is believed to be the oldest surviving swimming club in Britain. It was formed in 1844, in response to concerns over drownings in the River Medway, especially since would-be rescuers would often drown because they themselves could not swim to safety. The club used to swim in the River Medway, and would hold races, diving competitions and water polo matches. \"The South East Gazette\" July 1844 reported an aquatic breakfast party: coffee and biscuits were served on a floating raft in the river. The coffee was kept hot over a fire; club members had to tread water and drink coffee at the same time. The last swimmers managed to overturn the raft, to the amusement of 150 spectators.\nThe Amateur Swimming Association was founded in 1869 in England, and the Oxford Swimming Club in 1909. The presence of indoor baths in the cobbled area of Merton Street might have persuaded the less hardy of the aquatic brigade to join. So, bathers gradually became swimmers, and bathing pools became swimming pools. In 1939, Oxford created its first major public indoor pool at Temple Cowley.\nThe modern Olympic Games started in 1896 and included swimming races, after which the popularity of swimming pools began to spread. In the US, the Racquet Club of Philadelphia clubhouse (1907) boasts one of the world's first modern above-ground swimming pools. The first swimming pool to go to sea on an ocean liner was installed on the White Star Line's \"Adriatic\" in 1906. The oldest known public swimming pool in the U.S., Underwood Pool, is located in Belmont, Massachusetts.\nInterest in competitive swimming grew following World War I. Standards improved and training became essential. Home swimming pools became popular in the United States after World War II and the publicity given to swimming sports by Hollywood films such as Esther Williams' \"Million Dollar Mermaid\" made a home pool a desirable status symbol. More than 50 years later, the home or residential swimming pool is a common sight. Some small nations enjoy a thriving swimming pool industry (e.g., New Zealand pop. 4,116,900 – holds the record in pools per capita with 65,000 home swimming pools and 125,000 spa pools).\nA two-storey, white concrete swimming pool building composed of horizontal cubic volumes built in 1959 at the Royal Roads Military College is on the Registry of Historic Places of Canada.\nWorld records.\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, the largest swimming pool in the world is San Alfonso del Mar Seawater pool in Algarrobo, Chile. It is long and has an area of 8 ha (20 acres). At its deepest, it is deep. It was completed in December 2006.\nThe largest indoor wave pool in the world is at DreamWorks Water Park within the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, United States, and the largest indoor pool in North America is at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab in the Sonny Carter Training Facility at NASA JSC in Houston.\nIn 2021, Deep Dive Dubai, located in Dubai, UAE, was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's deepest swimming pool reaching . The Y-40 swimming pool at the Hotel Terme Millepini in Padua, Italy, previously held the record, , from 2014 until 2021.\nThe Fleishhacker Pool in San Francisco was the largest heated outdoor swimming pool in the United States. Opened on 23 April 1925, it measured and was so large that the lifeguards required kayaks for patrol. It was closed in 1971 due to low patronage.\nIn Europe, the largest swimming pool opened in 1934 in Elbląg (Poland), providing a water area of .\nOne of the largest swimming pools ever built was reputedly created in Moscow after the Palace of Soviets remained uncompleted. The foundations of the palace were converted into the Moskva Pool open-air swimming pool after the process of de-Stalinisation. However, after the fall of communism, Christ the Saviour Cathedral was re-built on the site between 1995 and 2000; the cathedral had originally been located there.\nThe highest swimming pool is believed to be in Yangbajain (Tibet, China). This resort is located at AMSL and has two indoor swimming pools and one outdoor swimming pool, all filled with water from hot springs.\nDimensions.\nLength: Most pools in the world are measured in metres, but in the United States pools are often measured in feet and yards. In the UK most pools are calibrated in metres, but older pools measured in yards still exist. In the US, pools tend to either be 25 yards (SCY-short course yards), 25 metres (SCM-short course metres) or 50 metres (LCM - long course meters). US high schools and the NCAA conduct short course (25 yards) competition. There are also many pools  m long, so that 3 lengths = 100 m. This pool dimension is commonly used to accommodate water polo.\nUSA Swimming (USA-S) swims in both metric and non-metric pools. However, the international standard is metres, and world records are only recognized when swum in 50 m pools (or 25 m for short course) but 25-yard pools are very common in the US. In general, the shorter the pool, the faster the time for the same distance, since the swimmer gains speed from pushing off the wall after each turn at the end of the pool.\nWidth: The width of the pool depends on the number of swimming lanes and the width of each individual lane. In an Olympic swimming pool each lane is 2.5 meters wide and contains 10 lanes, thus making the pool 25 meters wide.\nDepth: The depth of a swimming pool depends on the purpose of the pool, and whether it is open to the public or strictly for private use. If it is a private casual, relaxing pool, it may go from deep. If it is a public pool designed for diving, it may slope from in the deep end. A children's play pool may be from deep. Most public pools have differing depths to accommodate different swimmer requirements. In many jurisdictions, it is a requirement to show the water depth with clearly marked depths affixed to the pool walls.\nTypes.\nPools can be either indoors or outdoors. They can be of any size and shape, and inground or above ground. Most pools are permanent fixtures, while others are temporary, collapsible structures.\nPrivate pools.\nPrivate pools are usually smaller than public pools, on average to whereas public pools usually start at . Home pools can be permanently built-in, or be assembled above ground and disassembled after summer. Privately owned outdoor pools in backyards or gardens started to proliferate in the 1950s in regions with warm summer climates, particularly in the United States with desegregation. A \"plunge pool\" is a smaller, permanently installed swimming pool, with a maximum size of approximately .\nConstruction methods for private pools vary greatly. The main types of in-ground pools are gunite shotcrete, concrete, vinyl-lined, and one-piece fiberglass shells.\nMany countries now have strict pool fencing requirements for private swimming pools, which require pool areas to be isolated so that unauthorized children younger than six years cannot enter. Many countries require a similar level of protection for the children residing in or visiting the house, although many pool owners prefer the visual aspect of the pool in close proximity to their living areas, and will not provide this level of protection. There is no consensus between states or countries on the requirements to fence private swimming pools, and in many places they are not required at all, particularly in rural settings.\nChildren's pools.\nInexpensive temporary polyvinyl chloride pools can be bought in supermarkets and taken down after summer. They are used mostly outdoors in yards, are typically shallow, and often their sides are inflated with air to stay rigid. When finished, the water and air can be let out and this type of pool can be folded up for convenient storage. They are regarded in the swimming pool industry as \"splasher\" pools intended for cooling off and amusing toddlers and children, not for swimming, hence the alternate name of \"kiddie\" pools.\nToys are available for children and other people to play with in pool water. They are often blown up with air so they are soft but still reasonably rugged, and can float in water.\nPublic pools.\nPublic pools are often part of a larger leisure center or recreational complex. These centres often have more than one pool, such as an indoor heated pool, an outdoor (chlorinated, saltwater or ozonated) pool which may be heated or unheated, a shallower children's pool, and a paddling pool for toddlers and infants. There may also be a sauna and one or more hot tubs or spa pools (\"jacuzzis\").\nMany upscale hotels and holiday resorts have a swimming pool for use by their guests. If a pool is in a separate building, the building may be called a natatorium. The building may sometimes also have facilities for related activities, such as a diving tank. Larger pools sometimes have a diving board affixed at one edge above the water.\nMany public swimming pools are rectangles 25 m or 50 m long, but they can be any size and shape. There are also elaborate pools with artificial waterfalls, fountains, splash pads, wave machines, varying depths of water, bridges, and island bars.\nSome swimming facilities have lockers for clothing and other belongings. The lockers can require a coin to be inserted in a slot, either as deposit or payment. There are usually showers – sometimes mandatory – before and/or after swimming. There are often also lifeguards to ensure the safety of users.\nWading or paddling pools are shallow bodies of water intended for use by small children, usually in parks. Concrete wading pools come in many shapes, traditionally rectangle, square or circle. Some are filled and drained daily due to lack of a filter system. Staff chlorinate the water to ensure health and safety standards.\nCompetition pools.\nThe Fédération Internationale de la Natation (FINA, International Swimming Federation) sets standards for competition pools: long and at least deep. Competition pools are generally indoors and heated to enable their use all year round, and to more easily comply with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and automatic officiating equipment.\nAn Olympic-size swimming pool (first used at the 1924 Olympics) is a pool that meets FINA's additional standards for the Olympic Games and for world championship events. It must be wide, divided into eight lanes of each, plus two areas of at each side of the pool. Depth must be at least .\nThe water must be kept at and the lighting level at greater than 1500 lux. There are also regulations for color of lane rope, positioning of backstroke flags (5 metres from each wall), and so on. Pools claimed to be \"Olympic pools\" do not always meet these regulations, as FINA cannot police use of the term. Touchpads are mounted on both walls for long course meets and each end for short course.\nA pool may be referred to as fast or slow, depending on its physical layout. Some design considerations allow the reduction of swimming resistance making the pool faster: namely, proper pool depth, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic and illumination designs.\nExercise pools.\nIn the last two decades, a new style of pool has gained popularity. These consist of a small vessel (usually about 2.5 × 5 m) in which the swimmer swims in place, either against the push of an artificially generated water current or against the pull of restraining devices. These pools have several names, such as \"swim spas\", \"swimming machines\", or \"swim systems\". They are all examples of different modes of resistance swimming.\nHot tubs and spa pools.\nHot tubs and spa pools are common heated pools used for relaxation and sometimes for therapy. Commercial spas are common in the swimming pool area or sauna area of a health club or fitness center, in men's clubs, women's clubs, motels and exclusive five-star hotel suites. Spa clubs may have very large pools, some segmented into increasing temperatures. In Japan, men's clubs with many spas of different size and temperature are common. Commercial spas are generally made of concrete, with a mosaic tiled interior. More recently with the innovation of the pre-form composite method where mosaic tiles are bonded to the shell this enables commercial spas to be completely factory manufactured to specification and delivered in one piece. Hot tubs are typically made somewhat like a wine barrel with straight sides, from wood such as Californian redwood held in place by metal hoops. Immersion of the head is not recommended in spas or hot tubs due to a potential risk of underwater entrapment from the pump suction forces. However, commercial installations in many countries must comply with various safety standards which reduce this risk considerably.\nHome spas are a worldwide retail item in western countries since the 1980s, and are sold in dedicated spa stores, pool shops, department stores, the Internet, and catalog sales books. They are almost always made from heat-extruded acrylic sheet Perspex, often colored in marble look-alike patterns. They rarely exceed and are typically deep, restricted by the availability of the raw sheet sizes (typically manufactured in Japan). There is often a mid-depth seating or lounging system, and contoured lounger style reclining seats are common. Upmarket spas include various jet nozzles (massage, pulsating, etc.), a drinks tray, lights, LCD flat-screen TV sets and other features that make the pool a recreation center. Due to their family-oriented nature, home spas are normally operated from . Many pools are incorporated in a redwood or simulated wood surround, and are termed \"portable\" as they may be placed on a patio rather than sunken into a permanent location. Some portable spas are shallow and narrow enough to fit sideways through a standard door and be used inside a room. Low power electric immersion heaters are common with home spas.\nWhirlpool tubs first became popular in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s. A spa is also called a \"jacuzzi\" there, as the word became a generic after-plumbing component manufacturer; Jacuzzi introduced the \"spa whirlpool\" in 1968. Air bubbles may be introduced into the nozzles via an air-bleed venturi pump that combines cooler air with the incoming heated water to cool the pool if the temperature rises uncomfortably high. Some spas have a constant stream of bubbles fed via the seating area of the pool, or a footwell area. This is more common as a temperature control device where the heated water comes from a natural (uncontrolled heat) geothermal source, rather than artificially heated. Water temperature is usually very warm to hot – – so bathers usually stay in for only 20 to 30 minutes. Bromine or mineral sanitizers are often recommended as sanitizers for spas because chlorine dissipates at a high temperature, thereby heightening its strong chemical smell. Ozone is an effective bactericide and is commonly included in the circulation system with cartridge filtration, but not with sand media filtration due to clogging problems with turbid body fats.\nOcean pools.\nIn the early 20th century, especially in Australia, ocean pools were built, typically on headlands by enclosing part of the rock shelf, with water circulated through the pools by flooding from tidal tanks or by regular flooding over the side of the pools at high tide. This continued a pre-European tradition of bathing in rockpools with many of the current sites being expanded from sites used by Aboriginal Australians or early European settlers. Bathing in these pools provided security against both rough surf and sea life. There were often separate pools for women and men, or the pool was open to the sexes at different times with a break for bathers to climb in without fear of observation by the other sex. These were the forerunners of modern \"Olympic\" pools. A variation was the later development of sea- or harbour-side pools that circulated sea water using pumps. A pool of this type was the training ground for Australian Olympian Dawn Fraser.\nThere are currently about 100 ocean baths in New South Wales, which can range from small pools roughly 25 metres long and \"Olympic Sized\" (50m) to the very large, such as the 50 × 100 m baths in Newcastle. While most are free, a number charge fees, such as the Bondi Icebergs Club pool at Bondi Beach. Despite the development of chlorinated and heated pools, ocean baths remain a popular form of recreation in New South Wales.\nA semi-natural ocean pool exists on the central coast of New South Wales; it is called The Bogey Hole.\nInfinity pools.\nAn infinity pool (also named \"negative edge\" or \"vanishing edge pool\") is a swimming pool which produces a visual effect of water extending to the horizon, vanishing, or extending to \"infinity\". Often, the water appears to fall into an ocean, lake, bay, or other similar body of water. The illusion is most effective whenever there is a significant change in elevation, though having a natural body of water on the horizon is not a limiting factor.\nNatural pools and ponds.\nNatural pools were developed in central and western Europe in the early and mid-1980s by designers and landscape architects with environmental concerns. They have recently been growing in popularity as an alternative to traditional swimming pools. Natural pools are constructed bodies of water in which no chemicals or devices that disinfect or sterilize water are used, and all the cleaning of the pool is achieved purely with the motion of the water through biological filters and plants rooted hydroponically in the system. In essence, natural pools seek to recreate swimming holes and swimmable lakes, the environment where people feel safe swimming in a non-polluted, healthy, and ecologically balanced body of water.\nWater in natural pools has many desirable characteristics. For example, red eyes, dried-out skin and hair, and bleached swimsuits associated with overly chlorinated water are naturally absent in natural pools. Natural pools, by requiring a water garden to be a part of the system, offer different aesthetic options and can support amphibious wildlife such as snails, frogs, and salamanders, and even small fish if desired.\nZero-entry swimming pools.\nA \"zero-entry swimming pool\", also called a \"beach entry swimming pool\", has an edge or entry that gradually slopes from the deck into the water, becoming deeper with each step, in the manner of a natural beach. As there are no stairs or ladders to navigate, this type of entry assists older people, young children and people with accessibility problems (e.g., people with a physical disability) where gradual entry is useful.\nIndoor pools.\nIndoor pools are located inside a building with a roof and are insulated by at least three walls. Built for year-round swimming or training, they are found in all climate types. Since the buildings around indoor pools are insulated, heat escapes much less, making it less expensive to heat indoor pools than outdoor pools (all of whose heat escapes). Architecturally, an indoor pool may look like the rest of the building, but extra heating and ventilation and other engineering solutions are required to ensure comfortable humidity levels. In addition to drainage and automatic pool covers, there are a number of ways to remove humidity in the air that is present in any wet indoor environment. Efficient dehumidification in the indoor pool environment prevents structural damage, lowers energy costs for cooling or heating, and improves the indoor climate to provide a comfortable swimming environment.\nSome colleges, universities, and high schools have buildings that use the term \"natatorium\" in their names, especially when the building houses more than just a swimming pool, for example a diving well or facilities for water polo. The word \"natatorium\" was borrowed from Late Latin \"place for swimming\" into English in New England in 1890.\nSuspended swimming pool.\nThis type of swimming pool is suspended high above the ground. A prominent example is the Sky Pool in London's Embassy Gardens, the world's first floating pool.\nOther uses.\nSwimming pools are also used for events such as synchronized swimming, water polo, canoe polo and underwater sports such as underwater hockey, underwater rugby, finswimming and sport diving as well as for teaching diving, lifesaving and scuba diving techniques. They have also been used for specialist tasks such as teaching water-ditching survival techniques for aircraft and submarine crews and astronaut training. Round-cornered, irregular swimming pools, such as the Nude Bowl, were drained of water and used for vertical skateboarding.\nSanitation.\nLevels of bacteria and viruses in swimming pool water must be kept low to prevent the spread of diseases and pathogens. Bacteria, algae and insect larvae can enter the pool if water is not properly sanitized. Pumps, mechanical sand filters, and disinfectants are often used to sanitise the water.\nChemical disinfectants, such as chlorine (usually as a hypochlorite salt, such as calcium hypochlorite) and bromine, are commonly used to kill pathogens. If not properly maintained, chemical sanitation can produce high levels of disinfection byproducts. Sanitized swimming pool water can theoretically appear green if a certain amount of iron salts or copper chloride are present in the water.\nAcesulfame potassium has been used to estimate how much urine is discharged by swimmers into a pool. In a Canadian study it was estimated that swimmers had released 75 litres of urine into a large pool that had about 830,000 litres of water and was a third of the size of an olympic pool. Hot tubs were found to have higher readings of the marker. While urine itself is relatively harmless, its degradation products may lead to asthma.\nCovers.\nSwimming pool heating costs can be significantly reduced by using a pool cover. Use of a pool cover also can help reduce the amount of chemicals (chlorine, etc.) required by the pool. Outdoor pools gain heat from the sun, absorbing 75–85% of the solar energy striking the pool surface. Though a cover decreases the total amount of solar heat absorbed by the pool, the cover eliminates heat loss due to evaporation and reduces heat loss at night through its insulating properties. Most swimming pool heat loss is through evaporation.\nWinterization.\nIn areas which reach freezing temperature, it is important to close a pool properly. This varies greatly between in-ground and above-ground pools. By taking steps to properly secure the pool, it lessens the likelihood that the superstructure will be damaged or compromised by freezing water.\nClosing vinyl and fibreglass pools.\nIn preparation for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool should also be closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with rubber plugs, to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover is attached to the pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a bungee cord, and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or basketballs can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main drain plug removed and all water drained out. Drain plugs on the pool filter are removed after the filter has been cleaned. The pool pump motor is taken under cover. Winter chemicals are added to keep the pool clean. The innovation of a composite construction of fiberglass, with an epoxy coating and porcelain ceramic tiles has led to the pre-form, composite-type with significant advantages over older methods; however, it also has increased sensitivity to metal staining.\nIn climates where there is no risk of freezing, closing down the pool for winter is not so important. Typically, the thermal cover is removed and stored. Winter sunlight can create an algae mess when a cover that has been left on all winter is removed. The pool is correctly pH-balanced and super-chlorinated. One part algaecide for every 50,000 parts of pool water should be added, and topped up each month. The pool should be filtered for one to two hours daily to keep the automated chlorination system active.\nSafety.\nPools pose a risk of drowning, which may be significant for swimmers who are inexperienced, suffer from seizures, or are susceptible to a heart or respiratory condition. Lifeguards are employed at most pools to execute water rescues and administer first aid as needed in order to reduce this risk.\nDiving in shallow areas of a pool may also lead to significant head and neck injuries; diving, especially head-first diving, should be done in the deepest point of the pool, minimally , but desirably , deeper if the distance between the water and the board is great.\nPools also present a risk of death due to drowning, particularly in young children. In regions where residential pools are common, drowning is a major cause of childhood death. As a precaution, many jurisdictions require that residential pools be enclosed with fencing to restrict unauthorized access. Many products exist, such as removable baby fences. The evidence for floating alarms and window/door alarms to reduce the risk of drowning is poor. Some pools are equipped with computer-aided drowning prevention or other forms of electronic safety and security systems.\nSuspended ceilings in indoor swimming pools are safety-relevant components. The selection of materials under tension should be done with care. Especially the selection of unsuitable stainless steels can cause problems with stress corrosion cracking.\nDress code.\nIn public swimming pools, dress code may be stricter than on public beaches, and in indoor pools stricter than outdoor pools. For example, in countries where women can be topless on the beach, this is often not allowed in a swimming pool, and a swimsuit must be worn. For men, wearing ordinary shorts and a T-shirt to go in the water at a beach may be considered acceptable, but pools usually require real swimsuits or other dedicated water wear as swimming with regular clothes can potentially weigh a swimmer down should they need to be rescued. In France and some other European countries, board shorts are usually not allowed for \"hygienic\" reasons. In Nordic countries, in particular Iceland, rules about clothing and hygiene are especially strict. When diving from a high board, swimsuits are sometimes worn doubled up (one brief inside another) in case the outer suit tears on impact with the water."

Standing at a height of , he played mainly at the small forward position, and he was an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection in 2015.\nHigh school.\nSmith attended William Penn High School, in New Castle, Delaware, Delaware, where he played high school basketball.\nCollege career.\nAfter playing high school basketball, Smith played college basketball at Coffeyville Community College, with the Coffeyville Red Ravens (NJCAA), in the 2001–02 season. He then played at the University of Virginia, with the Virginia Cavaliers (NCAA Division I), from 2002 to 2005.\nProfessional career.\nEarly years.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2005 NBA draft, Smith signed a contract with the Spanish team Bruesa GBC. With them, he won the LEB Oro, the 2nd-tier Spanish League in 2006. He stayed in the club for two seasons, before moving to the Italian team Air Avellino in the summer of 2007. With them, he won the Italian Cup in 2008 and was named the MVP of the Italian Cup.\nAfter breakthrough season, in the summer of 2008, he signed a contract with the Turkish team Fenerbahçe Ülker. With them, he played in the EuroLeague for the first time in his career. Over 14 games in the EuroLeague, he averaged 7.9 points and 3.4 rebounds per game. However, they went short of all the trophies and Smith didn't extend his contract with the team.\nIn 2010, he signed with the Greek team Panellinios where he stayed for one season.\nBenetton Treviso.\nOn July 22, 2010, Smith signed a one-year deal with Italian team Benetton Treviso. Over the season, he averaged 15.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game in the EuroCup, and 13.7 points and 4.8 rebounds in the Italian League. He was also named to the All-EuroCup First Team for the performances he showed over the season. This was his second consecutive nomination, after also being selected the season before while playing for Panellinios.\nMaccabi Tel Aviv.\nOn June 23, 2011, Smith signed a two-year deal with the Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv.\nOn April 1, 2013, he was named the EuroLeague MVP of the month of March, his first such monthly award. Over the month, he helped his team win 4 straight games after having 2–5 score in its Top 16 group. He averaged 15.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2 steals per game. He had statistically the best season since coming in the club, having the averages of 11.5 points, 4 rebounds and 1.6 assists over 25 EuroLeague games played. Maccabi however went short of all the trophies.\nOn June 26, 2013, he signed a new two-year contract with Maccabi. With the first half of the season ended, team's performances showed very little hope that the season would be better than the previous. However, Maccabi finished the season by winning the triple crown. Maccabi eventually won its sixth EuroLeague championship, Smith's first, by defeating Real Madrid in an overtime 98–86 finals game. Smith was one of the key Maccabi players, averaging 9.9 points and career-high 5.6 rebounds with career-high shooting percentages.\nIn the summer of 2014, Maccabi's roster changed dramatically with the departure of head coach David Blatt, and some key players from the previous season like David Blu, Tyrese Rice, Ricky Hickman and Joe Ingles. His role in the team as being one of the best and most experienced players was left unchanged, as he had many touches. He was named the EuroLeague MVP of the month of December, his second monthly MVP award. Over the month of December, he averaged 20.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals per game. Maccabi was eventually stopped in the quarter-final series, after being swept by Fenerbahçe Ülker. In May 2015, he was chosen to the All-EuroLeague Second Team for the performances he put up over the season. He had his best season since coming into the club, averaging all career-highs of 15 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 1 steal, over 25 games in the EuroLeague.\nOn April 7, 2015, he signed a new three-year contract with Maccabi.\nOn September 27, 2017, after 6 seasons with Maccabi, Smith announced his retirement from playing professional basketball.\nCoaching career.\nOn June 11, 2018, Smith would join Jason Staudt as new assistant coaches for the Phoenix Suns under new head coach Igor Kokoškov's staff. However, after putting up a 19–63 record with the Suns, Smith was fired alongside the rest of the team's coaching staff on April 23, 2019.\nOn October 13, 2023, Smith was hired as an assistant coach by the Capital City Go-Go of the NBA G League.\nPersonal.\nSmith's wife is Danielle Greene, with whom he has 2 daughters."

The home side won by seven wickets with a match-winning performance by 'R Laver', who claimed six Weston-super-Mare wickets, and then top-scored for Glastonbury in their reply with 54. Laver continued to star for Glastonbury in the three recorded matches from 1894, taking seven wickets against Wells, six against Yeovil, and five against Bridgwater. He claimed five wickets again in 1899, their next recorded match, against Wincanton.\nIn 1986, the Morlands Athletic Ground was renamed the Tor Leisure Ground. Glastonbury played in the Somerset League from at least 1990 until 2002, when they were divisional champions, earning promotion to the Bristol &amp; Somerset Division. They won this division at the first attempt in 2003. Despite finishing with fewer points than Midsomer Norton, they had a higher average number of points due to having one more match cancelled.

Hogan won the PGA Championship in 1946 and 1948, then did not enter for over a decade. After his near-fatal automobile accident in early 1949, his battered legs could not endure the arduous double-round schedule for five consecutive days. He played in three of the events in the 1960s, after the change of format to stroke play.\nThe concept of the modern grand slam and professional major championships were not firmly established in 1953, as evidenced by the schedule conflict in early July. The PGA Championship moved two weeks later in 1954 to avoid this conflict, but during the 1960s, the two majors were played in consecutive weeks in July on five occasions.

Jack Burke Jr. won his second major championship of 1956, a 3 and 2 victory over Ted Kroll; Burke had won the Masters in April. It was the penultimate PGA Championship as a match play competition; stroke play was introduced two years later in 1958. This was the tenth and final year the PGA Championship was scheduled for a Tuesday finish.\nDefending champion Doug Ford was stopped in the third round by 1953 champion Walter Burkemo, 5 and 3.\nBlue Hill was not highly regarded as a championship venue and calls increased for a change in format to stroke play. Also, a five-year membership in the PGA of America was necessary to compete in the PGA Championship at the time; this excluded young professionals Arnold Palmer, Dow Finsterwald, Gene Littler, and Mike Souchak.\nThis remains the only time the PGA Championship has been played in Massachusetts. It was the 8th major championship played in the state and the first in over 30 years, since the 1925 U.S. Open. The next major held in the state would be the 1963 U.S. Open.\nBurke was the second to win the Masters and PGA Championship in the same calendar year, following Sam Snead in 1949. Through 2016, it has only been accomplished four times, with the latter two by Jack Nicklaus in 1963 and 1975.\nThe Open Championship was held two weeks earlier in England at Royal Liverpool Golf Club; neither Burke nor Kroll played in 1956 (or ever).\nIn the skills competitions held on Thursday, Joe Kraak won the long driving contest at .\nFormat.\nThe match play format at the PGA Championship was modified in 1956 and called for 9 rounds (162 holes) in five days, Friday through Tuesday. Previously, a two-day stroke play qualifying segment (36 holes) on Wednesday and Thursday preceded the match play competition to narrow the field to 64 competitors. This year, 128 players were entered in the single-elimination bracket. The first five rounds were 18-hole matches contested over the first three days, which reduced the field to four players. The semifinals and finals were 36-hole matches played on the final two days, Monday and Tuesday.\nFinal results.\n\"Tuesday, July 24, 1956\"\nFinal eight bracket.\nIn the Sunday quarterfinals, Ted Kroll defeated favorite Sam Snead 2 and 1. In the semifinals, Kroll needed only 28 holes to handily defeat Bill Johnston 10 and 8, but Burke's match went 37 holes, extended to an extra hole to stop Ed Furgol, the 1954 U.S. Open champion. In the final on Tuesday, Burke was three holes down to Kroll after 19 holes, then won five of the next seven holes. The two then halved the next seven holes and Kroll's bogey at the par-3 34th hole ended the match at 3 and 2.\nFinal match scorecards.\n\"Morning\"\n\"Afternoon\""

Hebert birdied the next three and Finsterwald matched two of them, but then bogeyed the 34th and was two down with two to play; the par-3 35th was halved with pars to end the match. Hebert earned $8,000 for the victory and Finsterwald received $5,000 as runner-up. Burkemo, the 1953 champion, defeated Whitt 3&amp;1 to claim third place and $3,500.

Firestone Country Club in Ohio, scheduled to host in 1967, swapped years with Columbine and was the site of the tournament in 1966.\nThere was a possibility of a boycott of the championship by the top tournament players, due to grievances with the PGA of America.

He was also the 54-hole leader, four strokes ahead of Crampton.\nIt was the second major of the year for Nicklaus, who won his fifth green jacket in April at the Masters, and the fourth of five times that he won two majors in the same calendar year.\nThrough 2021, this was the fourth and most recent time a player won the Masters and PGA Championship in the same calendar year. Nicklaus had previously won both in 1963, preceded by Jack Burke Jr. (1956) and Sam Snead (1949). Nicklaus also held both titles after a Masters win in 1972, and Tiger Woods held all four major titles after his Masters win in 2001.\nThis was the third PGA Championship at the South Course, which previously hosted in 1960 and 1966.

        "text": "The 1977 PGA Championship was the 59th PGA Championship, played August 11–14 at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California. Lanny Wadkins, 27, won his only major championship in a sudden-death playoff over Gene Littler. It was the first playoff at the PGA Championship in ten years and was the first-ever sudden-death playoff in a stroke-play major championship. The last was 36 years earlier at the 1941 PGA Championship, when the 36-hole final match went to two extra holes.\nPrior to the start of the championship, the irons of several top players were deemed to have non-conforming groove dimensions, most notably those of Tom Watson. He had won the Masters and British Open earlier that year, and was attempting to become the first to win three majors in the same year since Ben Hogan in 1953. Others with non-conforming irons included major winners Raymond Floyd, Hale Irwin, Gary Player, and Tom Weiskopf. The rule limiting groove width to had been around for decades. Watson shot an opening round of 68 (−4) with an old set of borrowed irons, and finished at 286 (−2), four strokes back in a tie for sixth. He won eight majors but never a PGA Championship; his only win in the U.S. Open came here at Pebble Beach in 1982.\nFour-time champion Jack Nicklaus finished one stroke out of the playoff at 283 (−5). He won the previous major at this course, the U.S. Open in 1972, and was runner-up to Watson at the next in 1982.\nThis was the 13th consecutive professional major won by American-born players. The streak began with Lee Trevino's victory at the 1974 PGA Championship and continued as the Americans swept the majors in 1975, 1976, and the previous majors in 1977. This remains the second longest major-winning streak for Americans; the longest was in the 1940s and ended with Lew Worsham's win at the 1947 U.S. Open.\nThis was the second major championship at Pebble Beach, which had hosted the U.S. Open in 1972. The U.S. Open returned in 1982, 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2019. It was only the second PGA Championship in California and the first as a stroke-play competition; the previous was in December 1929 in Los Angeles at Hillcrest. The 1962 event was originally awarded to Brentwood in L.A., but was moved to Philadelphia at Aronimink.\nThe fairways at Pebble Beach were extremely dry, due to an extended drought, in its third year in northern California.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 11, 1977\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 12, 1977\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 13, 1977\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 14, 1977\"\nLittler, 47, was the leader in each of the first three rounds and entered Sunday at 206 (−10), with a four-shot lead over Jack Nicklaus. One-under on the front nine, Littler staggered on the back with a five-over 41. After the turn, he made five bogeys in six holes, then rallied with pars on the three finishing holes to make the playoff with a 76 (+4). Wadkins started the round six strokes back and shot a 70, which included a birdie on the par-5 18th hole to get to six-under for the championship. As the clubhouse leader, he waited for the final pairing of Nicklaus and Littler. Tied for the lead with two holes remaining, Nicklaus bogeyed the par-3 17th to miss the playoff by a stroke. He had famously birdied the same hole in the final round of the 1972 U.S. Open, which he won by three strokes.\nPlayoff.\nThe sudden-death playoff began on the par-4 first hole, where Wadkins missed the green, chipped from the heavy rough to and saved par to tie. At the second hole, both reached the green of the par-5 in two shots, narrowly missed eagle putts, and tapped in for birdies. At the third hole, both missed the green in the heavy rough. Littler's difficult chip left him for a par four, while Wadkins got his chip to within five feet (1.5 m). After Littler missed to the right, Wadkins rolled his in for the win.\nThe championship had gone without a playoff since 1967. The seventh and last sudden-death playoff was in 1996; the format was changed to a three-hole aggregate, first used in 2000."

John Mahaffey won his only major championship in a sudden-death playoff over Jerry Pate and Tom Watson.\nWatson led the tournament each day and held a five-shot lead after 54 holes, but he faltered on Sunday with a 73 (+2) in his best opportunity for a PGA Championship, the only major he has never won. Pate had a four-foot (1.3 m) putt for a par and the victory on the 72nd hole, but it lipped out. After opening with a four-over 75 on Thursday, Mahaffey rebounded to go 12-under for the next three rounds, including a five-under 66 in the final round to gain the seven strokes on Watson. He had a history of hard luck in majors: at the U.S. Open, he lost the 18-hole playoff in 1975 and was the 54-hole leader in 1976, won by tour rookie Pate. Mahaffey broke that streak when he birdied the second extra hole to win the playoff at Oakmont.\nIt was the second of three consecutive playoffs at the PGA Championship.\nLike Arnold Palmer, Watson won numerous majors but never the PGA Championship, the only leg missing for a career grand slam. At this time he had won three of his eight majors; his next best finish at the PGA Championship came fifteen years later in 1993, placing fifth at Inverness. Pate finished in the top five for the third straight year (and would again the next year) but never won another major.\nJack Nicklaus, age 38, shot a 79 in the first round and missed the cut by five strokes in one of his worst performances in a major. Four-time champion Nicklaus was a pre-tournament favorite: in his previous majors at Oakmont (two U.S. Opens), he won in 1962, his first major and first win as a professional, and tied for fourth in the 1973. At the previous year's PGA Championship at Pebble Beach, he finished third, one stroke out of the playoff.\nThis was the eighth major held at Oakmont and its third PGA Championship; the previous two in 1922 and 1951 were match play events.\nCourse layout.\nLengths of the course for previous major championships:\nBefore 1962, the 1st hole was played as a par 5.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 3, 1978\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 4, 1978\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 5, 1978\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 6, 1978\"\nPlayoff.\nThe sudden death playoff began on the front nine at hole #1, a par-4 which all three parred.&lt;br&gt;After Watson and Pate could not birdie hole #2, Mahaffey sunk a birdie putt to win the title."

After a double-bogey on the 72nd hole, David Graham won the first of his two major titles on the third hole of a sudden-death playoff with Ben Crenshaw. Through 17 holes in the final round, Graham was seven-under, with seven birdies and ten pars. Of the 21 holes he played Sunday, nine were birdies.\nAfter 54 holes, Rex Caldwell was the leader at 203 (−7), Crenshaw was two strokes back and Graham four behind at 207 (−3), all in search of their first major title. It was the fifth runner-up finish for Crenshaw in a major, and second consecutive. He later won two majors, both at the Masters, in 1984 and 1995; Graham won his second at the U.S. Open in 1981 at Merion.\nThree-time champion Sam Snead set the record for the oldest player to make the cut in a major. He was 67 years, 2 months, and 7 days of age at the cut and finished 42nd at 288 (+8). He won in 1942, 1949, and 1951, all in match play.\nIt was the sixth major championship held on the South Course, which previously hosted the PGA Championship in 1972 and the U.S. Open in 1924, 1937, 1951, and 1961. It later hosted the U.S. Open in 1985 and 1996, the PGA Championship in 2008, and the Ryder Cup in 2004.\nThis was the third consecutive playoff at the PGA Championship (and nearly the fourth, as the 1976 title was decided by the final putt on the 72nd green).\nGraham became the second Australian-born player to win the PGA Championship, preceded by Jim Ferrier in 1947.\nJerry Pate and Tom Watson, runners-up in the previous year's playoff, were tied with Graham in third place after 54 holes. Pate's 71 tied for fifth but Watson's 74 dropped him into a tie for twelfth at 281. Watson had won three of his eight majors at this time, but never completed the career grand slam, missing the PGA Championship leg. Defending champion John Mahaffey tied for 51st.\nThis was the final major championship of the 1970s. Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf played in the event assuring that they played in every major championship in the 1970s.

At the par-5 second hole, Crenshaw tapped in for birdie while Graham sank a ten-footer (3 m) to continue. He won with a birdie on the par-3 third hole, after Crenshaw found a bunker and his putt for par lipped out. Graham put his 4-iron tee shot to within and with two putts to win, sank the first."

        "text": "Patrick Francis Martin (April 13, 1894 – February 4, 1949) was a Major League Baseball pitcher from 1919 to 1920. He played for the \nPhiladelphia Athletics. Martin started seven major league games and went 1–6.\nMartin also pitched in the minor leagues from 1913 to 1927, compiling a career minor league record of 163–125. \nHis greatest season was 1916, with the Eastern League's New London Planters. He pitched a career-high 248 innings, \nwon a career-high 21 games, and led the league in winning percentage. The Planters won the pennant.\nBiography by Grandson David R Martin.\nPatrick Martin was born April 13, 1894, at 12:15 pm in Brooklyn NY. He was the fifth child of Michael Martin (age 35) and Ellen Mary Farrell (age 25), \nfollowing his siblings Edward, Rose, James and Helen, and before John. The family lived at 272 Smith Street in the 10th ward of Brooklyn, NY; \nwhere Michael supported his family as a checker.\nPatrick was inducted into the Army on September 20, 1917, at age 23 in Brooklyn, and served in World War I as a Corporal. He fought in the Battle of Château-Thierry (1918) France from April 6, 1918, to March 11, 1919, with the 306th Infantry Company C. While there, he received a machine gun wound to his leg October 1, 1918. The crucifix in his pocket helped to deflect the bullet, and he was awarded the Purple Heart. \nPatrick received an honorary discharge on March 28, 1919, and was also given a Victory medal and 2 Battle Clasps. Patrick was reported to be single, 5'11” tall, with blue eyes and brown hair.\nPatrick Martin made his living as a professional baseball player. His career began in the \"International League\" with the \"Binghamton Cobblers\", which was owned by George F. Johnson, with manager Frank Schulte. Their team was affectionately called the \"“Bingos”\" and later the \"Binghamton Triplets\". An article in the Binghamton, New York, newspaper, dated July 18, 1918: \n“Ironman Pat Martin pitches at Johnson Field against Jack Dunn's Baltimore Orioles.” Binghamton won both games of the double header 10-3 and 8–5. \nWhile they were in town, another double header was scheduled and again Binghamton swept Baltimore 10-3 and 6–2. At the time the news reported that “Jack Dunn owns the international league and all the parks, putting pressure on the umpires.”\nPat Martin also pitched for \"Columbus\" in the American Association (20th century) under Manager Clarence Rowland.\nThere are also reports of Martin pitching for the \"Springfield Planters\" on Plant Field and losing to New London 0–4, and having a sacrifice hit. \nA double header was then played against New London with Springfield taking both games 4-0 and 5–2.\nOn September 11, 1919, it was reported, by Ira Thomas of the \"American Baseball Club of Philadelphia\", that a deal of $2500 plus two pitchers was reached in return for Paddy Martin going to the \"Philadelphia Athletics\". Connie Mack was the Manager. \nOn January 6, 1921, Patrick Martin married Geraldine Lucreta Whalon of Binghamton NY. They had one son, Raymond Francis Martin on October 4, 1921. \nOn May 13, 1924, it was reported in the Binghamton paper that “Geraldine Whalon Martin, wife of Patrick F Martin died at 10:45 am Thursday at 11 Martha Street. Raymond and Patrick were at her side when she died, as Patrick had come home from Rochester to be with her.” Geraldine was only 25 years old, \nleaving Patrick and 2½ year old Raymond.\nIn the baseball season of 1924 it was reported at 6 feet tall, Patrick Martin had a “sparkling fast ball and bewildering curve.” During this season Martin pitched 29 games while playing for the \"Reading “Keystones”\" in the \"International League\". Managed by Spencer Abbott (baseball), Paddy Martin recorded 11 wins and 14 losses. With this record he was second to the top pitching record for the season with 2.97% earned runs per nine inning game. \nIn first place that year was Walter Beall of Rochester who had 2.76%. Beall was called up to the Yankees at the end of the season. Martin was sold to the \"Pacific Coast League\".\nIn the Binghamton Press on Sunday January 18, 1925, the records for pitching for the 1924 season were reported. It showed that Walter Beall of Rochester had 95 runs and went to the Yankees for the 1925 season. Patrick Martin pitched a total of 215 innings that year. In 29 games he won 11 and lost 14, completing 22 games, including 3 shutouts. He earned 71 runs and was sold to the \"Portland Beavers\". Lefty Grove pitched 47 games and 19 completed. \nHe earned 79 runs and went to the \"Philadelphia Athletics\". Walt Smallwood pitched 42 games, completing 22. He finished 13 games for others. \nHis record was 11 wins and 18 losses. He went on to play for the Reading Keys. Other pitchers mentioned were Al Mamaux who was turned back to the minors at Minneapolis, and Earl Moore who went on to the majors.\nIn the Toronto paper, Toronto Telegram (The Pink Tely), Vol. XLVI, it was reported that an exhibition game at Island Stadium on May 6 took place with Reading taking on the \"Toronto Leafs\", and Paddy Martin pitching for Toronto. In this game he gave up only 4 hits, and Toronto won 9–0.\nWhile with the \"Pacific Coast League\" and the \"Portland Beavers\", Paddy Martin was reported as their southpaw pitcher. Tom Turner was their Manager as they reported to the training camp in San Jose, California. A large photo exists showing the Los Angeles vs Portland teams before the April 7, 1935, game.\nPatrick F Martin died at the age of 54 years on February 4, 1949, in New York City."

Although an unfashionable second-tier club, Llwynypia provided several international caps around the turn of the century as the 'Rhondda forward' gained acceptability into the Welsh pack. Alexander as a strong prop forward was first selected to represent Wales in the 1898 Home Nations Championship in a game against Ireland, under the captaincy of Billy Bancroft. After a strong Welsh win, Alexander retained his position for the last game of the campaign against England.\nAlexander was back for all three matches of the 1899 Championship, which saw Wales demolish England in the opening game at St Helens, but then slip away in the later two encounters against Scotland and Ireland. Alexander missed the 1900 Championship, but played the last two games of the 1901 tournament. These would be his very last internationals, but he finished on a successful note with a clean win against the Irish. Alexander scored his only international points in the Ireland game with two tries.

        "text": "Samuel Douglas Taylor (February 27, 1933 – October 8, 2019) was an American professional baseball player, a Major League catcher who appeared in 473 games over six seasons from 1958 to 1963 for the Chicago Cubs, New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Indians. The left-handed-batting Taylor was listed as tall and .\nSigned by the Milwaukee Braves in 1956, Taylor was traded with Taylor Phillips to the Cubs for Eddie Haas, Don Kaiser and Bob Rush on December 5, 1957. He made his big league debut on April 20, 1958 against the St. Louis Cardinals. Appearing as a pinch hitter for Gene Fodge, he drew a walk in his first plate appearance. Overall, Taylor appeared in 96 games in 1958, hitting .259 with 78 hits, six home runs and 36 RBI.\nIn 110 games in 1959, Taylor hit .269 with 13 home runs and 43 runs batted in in 110 games. His 13 intentional walks were the fourth most that season. Taylor was involved in a rather peculiar situation in a game on June 30 of that year, between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Stan Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3–1. Pitcher Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. To Anderson's disappointment, the ball flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.\nTaylor slumped in 1960, hitting only .207 in 150 at-bats. He lost his starting catching role that year and played in only 74 games.\nTaylor was the team's second most used catcher in 1961, behind Dick Bertell. In 1961, he hit .238 with eight home runs and 23 RBI in 235 at-bats (89 games).\nTaylor began the 1962 season with the Cubs, hitting .133 in 15 at-bats with them. On April 26, he was traded to the Mets for Bob Smith. In 68 games with the Mets, he hit .222 with three home runs and 20 RBI. Overall, he hit .214 in 173 at-bats that season.\nIn 1963—his final season—Taylor played for three different teams. He began the year with the Mets and hit .257 in 41 at-bats with them. On July 1, he was traded with Charlie Neal to the Reds for another catcher, Jesse Gonder. He played in three games for the Reds, collecting no hits in six at-bats. On August 1, he was traded to the Indians for Gene Green. He collected three hits in 10 at-bats for the Indians. Overall, he hit .235 with no home runs and seven RBI in 51 at-bats. He played his final game on August 6.\nOverall, Taylor played six years in the majors, hitting .245 with 309 hits, 47 doubles, nine triples, 33 home runs and 147 RBI in 473 games.\nTaylor served in the United States Navy during the Korean Conflict. He died October 8, 2019."
