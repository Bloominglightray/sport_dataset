Future hall of fame coaches Johnny Orr and Vic Bubas left the team to join in with the war effort as did Walt Kersulis, a top 5 scorer from the previous season and Consensus First-Team All-American and team captain Walt Kirk. The addition of freshman Bob Doster and Dwight Humphrey to a lineup that included team Jack Burmaster, Robert Rowe and Walter Mroz became formidable opponents to every team they played including a no. 1 ranked DePaul. On December 29, 1945, the Fighting Illini took on George Mikan's Blue Demons, who had lost just eight games in three years, and defeated them by a score of 56-37. In the game Burmaster and Doster each scored 14 points with Mroz adding 11 in the second half. The victory proved that, even without team captain Kirk, who had gone to serve in the armed services, the young team was ready to take on all comers. The 1945 Blue Demons went on to win the 1945 National Invitation Tournament. Additionally, the 1945-46 season would be the finale for the University of Chicago as part of the Big Ten. Illinois would defeat the Maroons two times during the year, 70-28 and 85-24. Due to the departure of Chicago, the Big Ten would become the Big Nine until Michigan State joined the conference in 1950.\nMills used 31 players during the course of the season and had an overall record of 14 wins and 7 losses with a conference mark of 7 and 5, finishing in a fifth place tie in the Big Ten. The team finished with an 11 - 2 record at home and a road record of 3 - 5. Future All-American Dwight \"Dike\" Eddleman would appear in two games during the course of the season, as well as future North Carolina A&amp;T Aggies, hall-of-fame men's basketball coach, Cal Irvin, would appear in one game.\nDavid \"Matt\" Bullock.\n1946 saw the end of a 34-year career for Illini athletic trainer Matt Bullock. From 1913-47 David “Matt” Bullock saw to it that football and basketball stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Buddy Young, Ray Woods, Chuck Carney, Lou Boudreau, Andy Phillip and other Fighting Illini stayed healthy. During his long career at the University of Illinois, Bullock cared for more than 40,000 athletes.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season"

For example, the Associated Press began its\nbasketball poll in 1949 with United Press International adding its poll in\n1951 and from 1951-56 the Illini finished the season ranked in the Top 20 nationally every year.

A highlight of the 1957 season would take place on December 17, 1956, when Illinois defeated San Francisco, 62-33, snapping the Dons’ 51-game regular-season win streak.

The international match series against the New Zealand national rugby union team (the All Blacks) resulted in a 2–1 win for New Zealand, who won the first and third matches, with Australia winning the second match.

Nine senior players were unavailable for the tour and seventeen of the thirty selected for the tour had not been capped by Australia previously. Only five of the sixteen forwards had played internationals. Despite losing the international series the tour proved good for the future of Australian rugby – in his assessment for \"Rothmans Rugby Yearbook\" New Zealand writer Don Cameron stated that \"This represented the greatest triumph of all...Australia now has a deep fund of test-tried players\". Amongst the new players selected by Australia was David Campese, who would go on to play for Australia 101 times and score 64 tries in international matches, which remains an Australia record as of 2023."

        "title": "Gary Mullen (American football)",
        "text": "Gary Mullen (born February 1, 1963) is a former professional American football and Arena football player who played wide receiver and defensive back for eight seasons for the Denver Dynamite, Chicago Bears, Los Angeles Cobras, Detroit Drive, Cincinnati Rockers and the Milwaukee Mustangs. He was elected into the Arena Football Hall of Fame in 1998.\nEarly life.\nMullen attended Clairton High School in Clairton, Pennsylvania. While at Clairton, Mullen was a standout member of the football and basketball teams. Playing under the guidance of Head Coach Pat Risha, Mullen served as the quarterback and a defensive back for the Bears' football team. As a senior in 1980, Mullen lead the team to the WPIAL Class A football championship game, with a 29–8 victory over Shenango High School, but the Bears would lose in the championship game to Laurel High School. After the team's title run, Mullen was named The Pittsburgh Press Class A Player of the Year. As a senior on the basketball team, Mullen help lead the Bears to a runner up finish in the WPIAL Championship game. Mullen was recruited by West Virginia and Minnesota for football, and chose West Virginia because he stated, \"it wasn't too far from home and the program was rebuilding.\"\nCollege career.\nMullen attended West Virginia University after high school, where was a member of the Mountaineers football team from 1981 to 1984. After his freshman season, Mullen considered a transfer, but decided to stick it out after speaking with Risha. Mullen spent two years as a reserve wide receiver for the Mountaineers, but he continued to work hard to earn more playing time. Mullen earned playing time in 11 games during the 1983 season, amassing 19 receptions for 343 yards and three touchdowns. Mullen was also utilized as a kickoff returner, returning 12 kicks for 237 yards. Mullen's senior year at West Virginia was his most productive statistically, as he caught 31 passes for 557 yards and three touchdowns. In total, Mullen amassed 80 receptions for 1,332 yards and six touchdowns during his collegiate career. Gary was also part of three Mountaineer bowl game victories: the Peach Bowl in 1981, the Hall of Fame Classic Bowl in 1983, and the Bluebonnet Bowl in 1984.\nProfessional career.\nAfter not hearing his name called during the 1985 NFL Draft, Mullen was signed by the Detroit Lions, but was released before the season began. In the summer of 1986, Mullen signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he was unable to shake a bad case of the flu; Mullen left the Steelers by his own will. Mullen made one final attempt to continue his football career, when he attended a tryout for the upstart Arena Football League. Going into the tryout, Mullen wanted to join the Pittsburgh Gladiators, as they were close to where he grew up.\nDenver Dynamite.\nJust one day before Mullen was ready to quit on his football dream and join the U.S. Army, he received a phone call inviting him to try out to play for the Denver Dynamite of the Arena Football League. Mullen became a focal point for the Dynamite offense, but with the Arena Football League then making players play both ways, he was also a key player on defense. Mullen didn't take the lack of a defensive background as an excuse to not play hard on defense. Mullen had an outstanding season for the Dynamite, leading the team in receptions (26), receiving yards (502) and receiving touchdowns (11). The Dynamite tied for the best record in the AFL, which earned them a spot in ArenaBowl I. Mullen won ArenaBowl I MVP during his team's 45–16 victory over the Pittsburgh Gladiators.\nChicago Bears.\nMullen's play during the 1987 season earned him a chance to play for the Chicago Bears during the 1987 NFL strike. He played in all three games that the strike lasted, making two career receptions for 33 yards.\nLos Angeles Cobras.\nAfter the Dynamite suspended operations during the 1988 season, Mullen went to play for the expansion Los Angeles Cobras as they owned the rights to all Dynamite players. Mullen's one year of experience was heavily leaned on by the Cobras, and Mullen enjoyed being the main target for the Cobras. Mullen lead the Cobras with 61 receptions for 823-yards and 17 touchdowns. The Cobras finished in 4th place, which was good enough to earn them the 4th seed in the playoffs. They were matched against the 1 seed, Chicago Bruisers, with a chance to make it to ArenaBowl II. The Cobras lost 16–29, while Mullen paced the offense with 7 receptions for 78-yards and 1 touchdown. After the season ended, the Cobras, as well as other teams, folded and the league playing again in 1989 looked in doubt. When they league announced that they would be playing in May, Mullen said that he would not play in 1989 due to all the pay cuts he would be receiving.\nDetroit Drive.\nAfter sitting out the 1989 regular season to get himself more established at his full-time job, Mullen signed with the Detroit Drive during their playoff run. The Drive won ArenaBowl III. Mullen returned to the Drive in 1991, and teamed with fellow WR/DB George LaFrance and QB Art Schlichter, the Drive's offense stood as one of the most challenging to defend. He helped the Drive to a three-peat with a 37-yard touchdown reception, when the Drive defeated the Dallas Texans 51-27 in ArenaBowl IV. In 1992, the Drive were again on their way to the ArenaBowl, this time they faced the Orlando Predators.\nCincinnati Rockers.\nMullen was acquired by the Cincinnati Rockers for future considerations in 1993.\nMilwaukee Mustangs.\nWhen the Milwaukee Mustangs were formed in 1994, Mullen was selected in their expansion draft. Mullen signed a contract with the Mustangs a few days later.\nPersonal.\nBoth of Gary's brothers played professional football. His younger brother Keith Mullen, played arena football in 1991 with the Columbus Thunderbolts, while his older brother Davlin Mullen played for the New York Jets."

Norfolk won this match, which was reported in the \"Gazetteer &amp; London Daily Advertiser\" on Tuesday 28 August. Suffolk played two further matches against Norfolk on 10 and 12 September at Scole, Norfolk.\nA team representative of Suffolk is next recorded as playing in 1827 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). It was during this time that the Bury St Edmunds club became prominent, its reputation enhanced when Fuller Pilch joined in 1824. It was the Bury Club, as it was often called, playing under the name of Suffolk, that played two first-class matches against MCC in 1830, one at Lord's and the other at Field Lane, Bury St Edmunds. In 1847 Suffolk played two more first-class matches against MCC at the same venues.\nTeams representative of Suffolk continued to play minor matches until at least 1859, when an All-England Eleven played the county. The original Suffolk County Cricket Club was formed on 27 July 1864. It was reconstituted in 1932 and has always been a minor county team."

        "text": "William Hanson (born c. 1940) is a retired professional basketball player. He played one season in Spain with Real Madrid Baloncesto when they won the 1963–64 FIBA European Champions Cup. Hanson played college basketball with the Washington Huskies from 1960–1962, when the center was a three-time all-conference selection in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU).\nHanson started playing high school basketball in Washington at Blaine High School before moving to Mercer Island High School for his senior year. He was nationally recruited by universities to play basketball, a rarity at the time for a player in the Northwest. He decided to attend University of Washington, whose basketball coach, Tippy Dye, had helped make center Bob Houbregs an All-American. In 1962, Hanson became the first Husky to lead the conference in rebounding. On January 12, 1962, he scored 37 points and led the team to an 85–67 upset of No. 4 USC; he became just the third player in school history to reach 30 points in a game. He averaged 20.8 points per game during his college career, and left Washington second in scoring in school history behind Houbregs (25.6).\nHanson was selected by the Chicago Zephyrs, a National Basketball Association (NBA) expansion team, in the sixth round of the 1962 NBA draft, the 46th player taken. He declined to sign with Chicago, as his wife was still in school and the Zephyrs offered just a $6,000 contract. He played one season in Spain before attending business school and working in New York City and California.\nHanson is twice divorced, and has four daughters including twins, (3) grandchildren and (1) great-grandchild."

        "text": "James Betts (born May, 1949) Nathaniel, his given name makes him Nathaniel James Betts III, after his father and grandfather. Jim is in the direct bloodline of his Cherokee mother and grandmother, though his father was African American. Jim is a former American football player, university administrator, and business executive focusing on diversity and inclusion in the workplace. He played college football for the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1970. He also briefly played professional football for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). During the 1970s, he worked as an administrator in the University of Michigan athletic department. He later pursued a career in business and was in charge of minority recruitment at Domino's Pizza for many years.\nMichigan.\nA native of Cleveland, Ohio, Betts played high school football at Benedictine High School in Cleveland. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1967 and played college football there from 1968 to 1970. He played at several positions during his collegiate career, including quarterback, running back, wide receiver and safety. As a sophomore in 1968, Betts played at the running back and wide receiver positions. When Bo Schembechler became the team's head football coach in 1969, protests by African American players were disrupting the Indiana Hoosiers football team. An organization known as the Black Action Movement (BAM) was also spreading in Ann Arbor. Amid the threat of deteriorating race relations, Betts saw an opportunity to alter Schembechler's clean-shave policy. Betts told the coach that facial hair was part of the African American players' \"heritage.\" Schembechler agreed to relax the policy, reportedly \"to the amusement of the rest of the players, both black and white, who believed Betts was full of shit.\"\nAs the backup quarterback for the 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team, he totaled 293 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, 130 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. His best game as a quarterback came against Illinois on November 8, 1969, when he completed six of nine passes for 106 yards, including touchdown passes to Garvie Craw and John Gable. He also rushed for 51 yards and a touchdown on nine carries. Michigan defeated Illinois by a score of 57-0, marking the second worst defeat in the history of the Illinois football program. \nBetts also played in the 1969 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game, considered one of the biggest upsets in college football history. The unranked Wolverines defeated the No. 1 Buckeyes by a 24-12 score. The day before the game, a fight broke out between players from the two teams as they passed each other in the tunnel at Michigan Stadium. Schembechler and Woody Hayes separated the players. Forty years later, Betts recalled: \"On Friday, the Buckeyes were on the field first, doing their walk-through drills. Before they left, they lined up in the tunnel on both sides. As we made our way to the field, some Buckeye made a nasty comment and all hell broke loose. Woody and Bo were trying to separate guys as we were all fighting like cats and dogs. One of us yelled that we'd beat 'em tomorrow. And we did!\".\nAs a senior, Betts told Schembechler he was unhappy in the backup role and persuaded the coach to allow him to move to the defensive unit for the 1970 Michigan Wolverines football team. During spring practice, he made the switch to the safety position and received the Meyer Morton Trophy, awarded each year to the Michigan football player who showed \"the greatest development and most promise as a result of the annual spring practice.\" In his final game in a Michigan uniform, Betts had 14 tackles and intercepted a pass to set up a Michigan score in the 1970 Michigan-Ohio State game.\nAfter the 1970 football season, Betts was selected to play on defense for the Blue team in the annual Blue-Gray All-Star Game in Birmingham, Alabama.\nProfessional football.\nBetts was drafted by the New York Jets in the 10th round (240th overall pick) of the 1971 NFL Draft. In May 1971, he signed a contract to play for the Jets as a backup quarterback and safety. However, an eye injury cast uncertainty over his potential career as a professional football player. He lost 70% of the vision in his left eye in a swimming accident when a whistle struck him in the eye. He was cut by the Jets in training camp, tried out with the Minnesota Vikings, but was cut by them as well. He did play professional football for a short time with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League.\nLater years.\nAfter his playing career ended, Betts worked for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for two years. In August 1974, he was hired by the University of Michigan to direct the academic counseling and tutoring service for the university's student-athletes. In that capacity, he became an advocate for football players to complete their degrees.\nIn 1978, Betts moved to Chicago where he accepted a position with a financial services firm. He subsequently returned to Ann Arbor where he worked for an advertising firm founded by a former Michigan football player, Don Coleman.\nIn the late 1980s, Betts was hired by Domino's Pizza as its Director of Minority Recruitment, a position he held for at least 15 years. He also served as the company's Director of Urban Initiatives.\nBetts is married to Marty Betts, a former weight loss professional. They have two sons, Eric Stanton Betts, an actor in Los Angeles, and Evan James Betts, a fitness professional and model in New York City."

The group who left, known as the \"Whiz Kids\", consisted of 21-year-old All-America forward Andy Phillip and 20-year-olds Ken Menke, Gene Vance, Jack Smiley and Art Mathisen. Phillip went on to become a member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\nFour of the five, minus Mathisen, returned to Illinois and tried to recapture the glory for one more season in 1946–47 after the war ended, but the chemistry had changed as well as their talent. Illinois went 14–6.\nThe 1943–44 season, however, was a struggle for head coach Doug Mills, as it was the second worst season of his career. The overall record was 11 wins and 9 losses with a conference mark of 5 and 7. The team finished with a 6 - 4 record at home and a .500 record on the road at 5 - 5. The Illini returned only one player from the 1942-43 season, Gordon Horton, who wasn't even a starter, which meant the entire lineup was made up of rookie/unproven players. The starting lineup consisted of Walton Kirk, Howard Judson, Ray DeMoulin, Bob Morton, Don Delaney and Gordon Gillespie.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season"

        "title": "Philip Nelson (American football)",
        "text": "Philip Nelson (born September 11, 1993) is an American football quarterback who is a free agent. He played for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019, and for the Dallas Renegades of the XFL and Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\nEarly years.\nNelson attended Mankato West High School in Mankato, Minnesota. There he was a standout member of the football team, setting several state records on his way to winning the 2011 Minnesota Mr. Football Award. He is the son of Pat and Norma Nelson.\nNelson was scouted by Football Bowl Subdivision scouts during his junior year in high school. It was originally perceived that Nelson would be a very sought-after recruit during his senior year by numerous Big Ten schools and was highly regarded by recruiting expert Tom Lemming. Nelson conducted initial visits to a handful of schools to include Iowa State, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota.\nUpon visiting Minnesota in December 2010, Nelson received his first scholarship offer from Minnesota Head Coach Jerry Kill. Nelson committed to Minnesota on February 19, 2011.\nCollege career.\nMinnesota.\nOn October 20, 2012, Nelson's redshirt was pulled after struggling starter MarQueis Gray was injured the week before. Nelson's first game of his collegiate career came against the Wisconsin Badgers. The Gophers lost the game but Nelson passed for two touchdowns and was also the Gophers' leading rusher in the game. Nelson started the final seven games as a true freshman at Minnesota going 2–5 and the Gophers were invited to a bowl game for the first time since 2009. They lost in the Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas to Texas Tech 34–31 on December 28, 2012.\nIn Nelson's sophomore season, he endured peaks and valleys as the starting quarterback. He played in 12 games and led the Gophers to a 4–0 record at the beginning of the season. A hamstring injury against Iowa hampered Nelson's ability to be effective against the Hawkeyes. The Gophers lost 23–7. The next week against Michigan, back up quarterback Mitch Leidner took most of the reps but the Gophers were dismantled 42–13. Now on a losing streak and with ailing coach Jerry Kill watching from a private box, the Gophers hoped to get back on track against Northwestern. Leidner was replaced by a healthy Nelson in the first half of that game and the Gophers hung on for a 20–17 victory. Nelson would start the next four games and lead the Gophers to three signature victories over No. 24 ranked Nebraska, Indiana, and Penn State. The last two games of the season saw Nelson and Leidner split snaps as the team lost to Michigan State and then Syracuse in the Texas Bowl on December 28, 2013.\nRutgers.\nOn January 16, 2014, Nelson announced he was transferring from Minnesota; he would still have two years to play for a new team. On January 29, 2014, Nelson transferred to Rutgers. On May 13, 2014, he was dismissed from Rutgers following assault charges leading to a guilty plea for a fifth degree misdemeanor.\nEast Carolina.\nIn August 2015, Nelson walked on at East Carolina after soliciting interest from other teams. After winning the starting quarterback job, Nelson and the Pirates started the season 2–0 with wins against in-state rivals, Western Carolina and NC State. Nelson threw a combined six touchdown passes and ran for one score in those two matchups. However, following a loss with South Carolina the next week, the ECU squad would only win one more game the rest of the season.\nAfter the season came to a close, Nelson was invited to participate in the 2017 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. Nelson was named the National team's MVP as he led his squad on a 14-play scoring drive in the opening series of the game.\nProfessional career.\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers.\nIn January 2018, Nelson signed with the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers to compete for the fourth-string backup quarterback position. He was cut from the team in May before training camp.\nSan Diego Fleet.\nIn the third round of the inaugural AAF QB Draft, Nelson was picked by the San Diego Fleet with the eighth selection.\nNelson began the 2019 AAF season as the Fleet's second-string quarterback behind Mike Bercovici. After Bercovici struggled for much of the season opener against the San Antonio Commanders, Nelson relieved him late in the game, completing 5 of 10 passes for 68 yards and an interception in the 15–6 loss. Nelson was eventually named the starter for the following week's game against the Atlanta Legends. In his first start against the Atlanta Legends, he completed 14 of 30 passes for 142 and an interception as the Fleet won 24–12. The following week's matchup against the Commanders saw Nelson throw an interception on the first play before rebounding with two touchdown passes in a 31–11 San Diego victory. During the fourth game against the Memphis Express, Nelson threw a touchdown before exiting in the second quarter with a shoulder injury; he was replaced by Alex Ross as the Fleet fell 26–23. The injury, later revealed to be a clavicle fracture, sidelined Nelson for the next month, and he was eventually placed on injured reserve. The league ceased operations in April 2019.\nDallas Renegades.\nNelson was taken by the Dallas Renegades with the 52nd pick of the 2020 XFL Draft. Nelson started in a week 1 15–9 loss to the St. Louis Battlehawks following an injury to starting quarterback Landry Jones. Nelson started again in a week 5 30–12 loss to the New York Guardians after another injury to starting quarterback Landry Jones. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020.\nMontreal Alouettes.\nNelson signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL on January 22, 2021. He was released before the start of the regular season on May 27.\nCareer statistics.\nSource:\nAssault charges.\nNelson was charged with first- and third-degree assault for kicking former Minnesota State Mankato football player Isaac Kolstad in the head during the early morning hours of May 11, 2014, after a night of underage drinking. The argument allegedly involved conversation surrounding a bar bouncer hitting on Nelson's girlfriend. Other people around the area reported that Nelson allegedly kicked Kolstad while he was unconscious, following being punched by a third party, Trevor Shelley. Shelley, also facing first- and third-degree assault charges, told police he did not hit Kolstad. Kolstad was left unable to breathe on his own following significant destruction of brain tissue and underwent surgeries. Surveillance video of the fight shows Kolstad throwing the first punch, knocking Nelson to the ground. The fight lasted eight seconds. Nelson, age 20, and Kolstad were both intoxicated, according to police. Kolstad's injuries included a skull fracture, brain shifting, brain bleeding and lung deterioration due to lack of oxygen. Kolstad moved home with his wife and two daughters in 2014 but have since divorced. Kolstad suffered permanent brain damage.\nNelson pleaded guilty to lesser charges and reached a civil settlement with Kolstad in 2018."

        "title": "Frank Hudson (American football)",
        "text": "Frank Hudson (1875 – December 24, 1950) was a football player and coach who was a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe from New Mexico.\nHe played college football for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1895 to 1899 and was considered the greatest kicker in the early years of American football. In 1898, he became the first Native American player of the sport to be selected as an All-American. He was selected as a first-team All-American by \"Outing\" magazine in both 1898 and 1899.\nFrom 1904 to 1906, he served as an assistant coach of the Carlisle football team, becoming one of the first non-white coaches in college football history.\nEarly years.\nHudson was born around 1875 in Paguate, New Mexico. His date of birth was unknown. He was a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe.\nPlaying career.\nCarlisle.\nHudson left his home and tribe in New Mexico to attend the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, an Indian boarding school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, formed for the purpose of assimilating Native American children from 39 tribes into the majority culture. While at Carlisle, Hudson became a star on the school's football team. He was the quarterback at Carlisle as early as 1895. In December 1896, he played in what is reported to have been \"the first game under electric light\"—a victory over Wisconsin. According to a press account from 1897, Hudson was only five feet, three inches tall, and weighed 130 pounds.\n1897 season.\nIn 1897, Hudson gained acclaim for drop-kicking field goals against two of the top teams in the country—Yale and Penn. Hudson accounted for all of Carlisle's points in a 20–10 loss to Penn at Franklin Field in Philadelphia. \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"little Hudson showed his ability as a kicker by dropping the ball squarely between the posts.\" The game against Yale was played at the Polo Grounds in New York, and \"The New York Times\" described Hudson's field goal as follows:\"[S]teadying himself for an instant the ball was dropped and with a delicate touch from his foot was sent sailing straight as a die toward the Yale goal. The spectators held their breath and watched the ball as it sailed on just over the heads of the Yale players and finally dropped over the bar. Then they cheered and young Hudson was the hero of the day. The goal was one of the prettiest ever seen ...\"\nThe success of the Carlisle football team was a source of great pride for Native Americans. In 1897, the \"Indian Helper\" (the Carlisle school newspaper) described a celebration that greeted the football team on its return from a game played in New York City against Yale University:\"On Monday morning after breakfast, the football team, who returned the evening before from the Yale game which was played at New York last Saturday, was treated to a free ride across the parade, in the large four horse herdic, drawn by the entire battalion. Capt. Pierce, Frank Cayou, Frank Hudson, and Martin Wheelock occupied the small phaeton drawn by boys, and went in advance of the others. The band played lively marches, as handkerchiefs waved and mouths shouted. The demonstration was a great surprise to all making a unique scene for such an early morning hour. The school is proud of the record made for clean playing, and were gratified that the boys scored.”\n1898 season.\nIn 1898, Hudson became the captain of the Carlisle football team. In October 1898, he accounted for all five of Carlisle's points in an 18–5 loss to Yale. \"The New York Times\" reported: \"The five points to Carlisle's credit are due to Quarterback Hudson's marvelous skill in kicking a goal from the forty-five-yard line. The trick caused consternation in the Yale line.\" The following week, Hudson again accounted for all of Carlisle's points in an 11–5 loss to Harvard. At the conclusion of the 1898 season, he was selected as the first-team quarterback on \"Outing\" magazine's 1898 College Football All-America Team. He was the first Native American player to be selected as an All-American.\n1899 season.\nHudson was the quarterback and drop-kicker for the 1899 Carlisle Indian team that compiled a 9–2 record. In a 22–10 loss to Harvard, Hudson's kicking was again a featured attraction. \"The New York Times\" reported: \"And now came the feature of the game, for which everybody had been waiting. The Indians advanced the ball to Harvard's thirty-five-yard line, when Hudson dropped back for a goal from the field. A second later and the pigskin went straight through the goal posts, and everybody was digging his neighbors' ribs and saying, 'I told you so.'\" For the first time, Carlisle defeated one of the \"Big Four\" of college football, defeating Penn by a score of 16 to 5.\nThe 1899 Carlisle team drew further acclaim after defeating Columbia, 45–0, in a Thanksgiving Day game played at Manhattan Field near the Polo Grounds in New York. Hudson drop-kicked four goals from touchdown and one field goal in the victory over Columbia. \"The New York Times\" cited Hudson's use of the drop kick technique as one of the features of the game:\"The other novelty was the way in which Hudson kicked goals. Instead of making a kick from a placed ball held by one of his eleven he chose to make all his tries for a goal by a drop kick, and he succeeded in most of his efforts. It was a new feature for a match game, though frequently tried in practice.\"\nWith its only two losses having come to Harvard and Princeton (ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the country), the 1899 Carlisle team was ranked No. 4 in the country by Walter Camp.\nFor the second consecutive year, he was selected as a first-team All-American on \"Outing\" magazine's 1899 College Football All-America Team. He was also selected as a third-team All-American on Walter Camp's 1899 All-America team.\nThe 1899 Carlisle team concluded its season with a 2–0 victory over an undefeated University of California team on Christmas Day in San Francisco. On the return trip from California, the Carlisle team stopped at the Haskell Indian Institute in Lawrence, Kansas, where a 12-year-old Jim Thorpe was in the crowd that greeted Hudson, Isaac Seneca, Martin Wheelock, and the rest of the Carlisle team.\nProfessional football.\nIn 1900, Hudson secured a position with a bank in Pittsburgh, and played a season of professional football with that city's Duquesne Country and Athletic Club.\nLegacy.\nFor years after his playing career ended, Hudson was considered to have been the greatest kicker in the sport's history. In 1910, one sportswriter noted:\"Frank Hudson, the greatest kicker, not barring Pat O'Dea, Marshall Reynolds, Billy Bull or John De Witt, who ever hoisted a spiral was an Indian. He was the greatest goal kicker known to football, and one of his best stunts was to stand in front of the goal posts with five footballs in his arms. He would drop them in quick succession to the ground, and as each touched the earth he toed them through the goal posts. He could drop-kick as far as fifty-five yards.\"\nCoaching career.\nIn 1904, Hudson became an assistant coach of the Carlisle football team. The national media covered the selection of non-whites to coach the Carlisle team as an experiment, with the \"Boston Daily Globe\" running a headline: \"FULL BLOODED INDIANS Coaching a Football Team: Will they prove equal in brains and skill to the paleface gridiron strategists of the leading universities? Carlisle is trying the experiment for the first time this season.\"\nIn 1905, he was responsible for coaching the backs and training the kickers. Along with Bemus Pierce, Hudson coached the 1906 Carlisle team with Pop Warner serving as advisory coach.\nLater years.\nHudson worked as a banker from at least 1900 to 1926. In January 1904, the \"Red Man and Helper\" reported:\"Frank Hudson is a principal clerk in a bank in Pittsburg. He was a little Indian when he came here years ago. Frank does more to give the people in the city of Pittsburg right conceptions of the Indian than all the Indian Rights Associations ever organized in the country.\"\nHudson, who later became a farmer, never married. He died in December 1950 of a cerebral hemorrhage at his farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He was posthumously inducted into the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame in 1973."

World Bowling Tour events include all the PBA Tour major tournaments. As a stepladder tournament, the season-ending World Bowling Tour Finals features the top three men, and top three women in the World Bowling Tour points standings.\nTour Qualifications.\nTo participate in the World Bowling Tour, bowlers must be a member of one of the federations of the World Tenpin Bowling Association. The federations of the WTBA include:\nThe winner of a WBT tournament can also earn credit for a PBA Tour title, as long as the bowler registered for the tournament beforehand as a professional. International bowlers, bowlers who do not reside in the United States, can also join the PBA under its PBA International program. If a PBA International member wins a WBT tournament, he must upgrade to full membership of the PBA.\nWBT Tournaments.\nThe entry fee for a WBT tournament is $5,000 USD. Winners of World Bowling Tour events also qualify for the PBA Tournament of Champions.\n2019 Schedule.\n\"Tournaments listed in bold are considered majors by the World Bowling Tour.\"\nMajor tournaments.\nIn order for a tournament to qualify as a major, it must offer a minimum prize fund of $200,000 USD. The tournaments that are recognized as majors by the World Bowling Tour include:\nWorld Bowling scoring.\nThe World Bowling scoring system, described as \"current frame scoring,\" is used during the stepladder finals of the World Bowling Tour Finals. Current frame scoring counts 30 pins for each strike (regardless of previous shot), 10 pins for each spare (bonus pins that are added match the first roll of the next frame), and basic pin count for open frames. The tenth frame follows the same format as the first nine frames. That means no bonus, or fill shots, are given. The maximum score is still 300, achieved with ten rather than twelve, consecutive strikes. World Bowling scoring is intended to be easier to understand than traditional scoring for fans or bowlers that are new to the sport. The television networks also advertised current frame scoring to increase struggling television ratings.\nMatch play scoring.\nMatch play scoring is a 12-frame system that made its first national appearance in bowling at the 2014 World Bowling Tour finals. This system scores by counting frames won rather than counting total pinfall. It resembles match play scoring in golf where players go even, plus one, or minus one as the match progresses. A frame is won if a bowler has a higher pinfall on the first roll of the frame than their opponent. The bowler that wins the most frames will win the match."

        "title": "Tony Elliott (American football coach)",
        "text": "Antonio \"Tony\" Elliott (born November 26, 1979) is an American football coach who is currently the head coach at the University of Virginia. He previously served as an assistant coach at Clemson University from 2011 to 2021, most recently as associate head coach, offensive coordinator, and tight ends coach, after serving most of those years as running backs coach and/or co-offensive coordinator.\nElliott played college football at Clemson as a wide receiver from 2000 to 2003. Prior to his tenure at Virginia, he held various assistant coaching positions at South Carolina State, Furman and Clemson. While at Clemson, he won the 2017 Broyles Award, which goes to the college game's top assistant. He was one of the highest paid coordinators in the sport during his time at Clemson, and there he recruited, coached, and called plays for the ACC's all-time leader in yards and touchdowns, Travis Etienne, and co-coordinated the offenses of Deshaun Watson and Trevor Lawrence. Elliott-coached offenses (in part) won two NCAA titles for Clemson, including a upset 44–16 victory over Alabama in January 2019.\nEarly life.\nElliott spent portions of his early childhood homeless on the streets of Los Angeles, California with his mother and sister. When he was 9 years old, his mother was killed in a car accident and he was sent to live with an aunt and uncle in South Carolina, where he began playing football and basketball.\nPlaying career.\nElliott graduated from James Island High School in Charleston in 1997, where he was a football and basketball star for the Trojans. After attending the United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School as a football recruit in 1997, Elliott played college football at Clemson University under head coach Tommy Bowden. He came to Clemson in the fall of 1999 as a walk-on. He was selected team captain in 2003, a rare accomplishment for a walk-on. He finished his career at Clemson with 4 letters and 44 games with 4 starts. Elliott won All-ACC academic honors as a student athlete.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nElliott started his coaching career as the wide receivers' coach for the South Carolina State Bulldogs in 2006. He then served in the same position for the Furman Paladins from 2008 to 2010.\nClemson.\nElliott made his return to the Clemson Tigers in early 2011 to fill the running back coach position. In December 2014, he was named co-offensive coordinator to replace outgoing offensive coordinator Chad Morris, who left to take over as head coach of the SMU football program. He shared coordinator duties with Clemson's wide receivers coach, Jeff Scott. Head coach Dabo Swinney announced that Elliott would be the play-caller for the 2014 Russell Athletic Bowl versus the Oklahoma Sooners, in which the Tigers defeated the Sooners by a score of 37–17.\nClemson's football team won the national championship in January 2017, beating Alabama, with Scott calling the offensive plays and serving as co-offensive coordinator for the game. In December 2017, Elliott was the recipient of the Broyles Award, presented to the top assistant coach in college football. In 2019, Elliott again called plays as co-offensive coordinator for Clemson's 44–16 win, again over Nick Saban's Alabama, to secure a second national championship.\nElliott was Clemson's primary offensive playcaller for seven seasons (2015–2021), including through both of Clemson's NCAA Championships and successful runs through the College Football Playoff. Elliott also coached the running backs and tight ends at Clemson. Elliott was the primary Clemson recruiter for these positions, including a \"diamond in the rough\" in four-star Travis Etienne, who under Elliott's position coaching and offensive playcalling (but mostly through his own talent, playing with two of the most winning high school and college quarterbacks of all time, and not leaving early for the NFL) became the ACC's all-time leader in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, total touchdowns, total points scored, and total yards gained. Under Elliott, Etienne scored at least one touchdown in 46 of his 55 career games, setting the NCAA and FBS records. As a coordinator, Elliott was also the primary playcaller for Trevor Lawrence.\nElliott gained the additional title of associate head coach for Clemson in 2021. During his seven years as sole or co-offensive coordinator for Clemson, the Tigers had a record of 88–10. After reportedly turning down Tennessee's head coaching job the previous year, Elliott decided he was ready for such a role after the 2021 season, being named as the leading candidate at Duke before interviewing twice in Charlottesville after Bronco Mendenhall had stepped down for personal reasons at Virginia... a program that was briefly rumored to favor one of its own (Penn State co-defensive coordinator Anthony Poindexter) for the spot. Elliott had been the primary offensive playcaller and co-coordinator on the opposite side of the field from his new team in the 2019 ACC Championship Game, a game his Tigers had won, 62–17, over the Cavaliers.\nVirginia.\nOn December 10, 2021, Elliott was named the 41st head coach at the University of Virginia, replacing Bronco Mendenhall.\nElliott set to work by hiring John Rudzinski from the United States Air Force Academy as his defensive coordinator, and Desmond Kitchings from the Atlanta Falcons as his offensive coordinator. Rudzinski's 2020 defense had ranked in the top 5 nationally for scoring defense and his 2021 defense had ranked in the national top 5 for total defense. Kitchings had previously been co-offensive coordinator at both NC State and Vanderbilt before most recently being a running backs coach in the NFL. \nThe Cavaliers, and quarterback Brennan Armstrong in particular, regressed tremendously in most statistical offensive categories in Elliot’s first year in Charlottesville. After finishing the most prolific passing season in Cavalier history (4400 passing yards, 31 TDs, 10 INTs), quarterback Brennan Armstrong struggled in the new offensive system (2200 passing yards, 7 TDs, 12 INTs). Armstrong entered his name in the NCAA’s transfer portal at the end of the season.\nPersonal life.\nElliott graduated with a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from Clemson University in 2002 with a team-high 3.55 GPA. Upon graduation, he worked as an engineer for Michelin North America for two years. He is married to the former Tamika Whitner of Spartanburg, South Carolina."

It has been a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963; and a top-class Twenty20 team since the inauguration of the Twenty20 Cup in 2003.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Nottinghamshire player and then his name is given as it usually appears on match scorecards. Note that many players represented other top-class teams besides Nottinghamshire. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club. The list has been updated to the end of the 2021 cricket season using the data published in Playfair Cricket Annual, 2022 edition.\nThe list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only. Players who represented the county before 1841 are included if they also played for the county club but excluded if not. Players who played only for Nottingham Cricket Club, which played some matches deemed first-class in the 19th century, are included in List of Nottingham Cricket Club players."

        "title": "Eric Fisher (American football)",
        "text": "Eric William Fisher (born January 5, 1991) is an American football offensive tackle who is a free agent. He played college football at Central Michigan University, and was selected first overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2013 NFL draft. He played for the Chiefs for eight seasons from 2013 to 2020, making two Pro Bowls and winning Super Bowl LIV over the San Francisco 49ers.\nEarly years.\nFisher and his sister were raised in Rochester, Michigan, by his mother. During that time, she also overcame thyroid cancer while raising them on her own. He attended Stoney Creek High School, where he was an All-State honorable mention lineman for the football team. Regarded as a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, he was not ranked among the best offensive tackle prospects in his class. According to Fisher, this was due to him being undersized for an offensive tackle, weighing only 225 pounds as a high school senior.\nCollege career.\nFisher played at Central Michigan University from 2009 to 2012 where he was recognized as a first-team All-American by \"Pro Football Weekly\", a second-team selection by \"Sports Illustrated\", and received third-team honors from the Associated Press. He was also a first-team All-Mid-American Conference (MAC) selection. Fisher was a part of two bowl wins while at Central Michigan; the 2010 GMAC Bowl and the 2012 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nFisher was considered one of the top offensive tackles (and overall players) available in the 2013 NFL draft. He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs with the first overall pick, becoming the first MAC player to be drafted No. 1 overall. Fisher is one of two Central Michigan players to be selected in the first round of an NFL Draft; the other is Joe Staley.\nOn July 26, 2013, Fisher signed a guaranteed contract with the Chiefs worth $22.1 million with a $14.5 million signing bonus. Despite playing left tackle during college, Fisher transitioned to right tackle for the 2013 season. He allowed 7 sacks and 35 hurries. According to Pro Football Focus, his run-blocking grade of −6.5 ranked 55th out of 76 NFL tackles who played at least 25 percent of their team's snaps. His overall grade as a tackle ranked 70th. Despite Fisher's struggles during his rookie season, Chiefs general manager John Dorsey noted Fisher's potential and expressed confidence that he would develop into a good player. Fisher played in 14 games, of which he started 13, during his rookie year of 2013.\nIn March 2014, head coach Andy Reid announced that he was moving Fisher to the left tackle position for the upcoming 2014 season, following the loss of Branden Albert in free agency. During the 2015 season, Fisher played in 16 games, starting in 14.\nOn May 2, 2016, the Chiefs picked up the fifth-year option Fisher's contract. On July 30, 2016, Fisher signed a four-year contract extension with the Chiefs worth $48 million, including $40 million guaranteed. In Week 1, after a strong performance, Pro Football Focus ranked Fisher as the number one left tackle of the week. In the divisional round of the 2016 playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Chiefs were down 18–10 in the 4th quarter. Following a successful two-point conversion, Fisher was called on a holding penalty that resulted in a loss of 10 yards. On the second attempt from the Steelers' 12-yard line, the Chiefs failed the two-point conversion, resulting in their elimination from the playoffs as they lost to the Steelers by a score of 18–16.\nIn 2019, Fisher was limited to eight games due to injuries. Fisher and the Chiefs went on to win Super Bowl LIV, their first championship in 50 years.\nFollowing the release of long-time Chiefs punter Dustin Colquitt in the 2020 offseason, Fisher became tied with Anthony Sherman and fellow 2013 draftee Travis Kelce as the longest tenured members of the Chiefs. In the Week 3 game of the Chiefs' 2020 season against the Baltimore Ravens, Fisher lined up as an eligible receiver and caught a two-yard pass for a touchdown, the first of his career. The touchdown was the first receiving touchdown scored by a number one overall selection since Keyshawn Johnson in 2006. Fisher was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the Chiefs on November 16, 2020, and activated three days later.\nOn January 24, 2021, against the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game, Fisher suffered a torn Achilles, forcing him to miss Super Bowl LV. He was placed on injured reserve on February 6. The Chiefs would go on to lose 31–9 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nFisher was released after eight seasons on March 11, 2021.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn May 12, 2021, Fisher signed a one-year, $8.38 million deal with the Indianapolis Colts.\nMiami Dolphins.\nOn December 5, 2022, the Miami Dolphins signed Fisher to their active roster. On January 6, 2023, Fisher was placed on injured reserve despite being inactive for every game."

        "text": "The 2013 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2013 Betfair World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 20 April to 6 May 2013 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was the 37th consecutive year the Crucible had hosted the World Snooker Championship; the 2013 event was the last ranking tournament of the 2012–13 snooker season. Sports betting company Betfair sponsored the event for the first time.\nDespite having missed virtually the entire season, defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan did not lose one session in the tournament and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 in the final to become a five-time World Champion, joining Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry as the only players to have successfully defended their titles at the Crucible. O'Sullivan broke Hendry's record of 127 career centuries at the Crucible, finishing the tournament with 131, and also became the first player to make six century breaks in a World Championship final. Of the 55 century breaks made during the event, Neil Robertson made the highest , a 143, in his first-round loss to Robert Milkins.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and the official professional world championship of the game of snooker. Since 1977, the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield has hosted the event. During the tournament, 32 professional players compete in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each of which is played over several . The event's 32-player lineup is selected using the snooker world rankings and a pre-tournament qualification round. English player Ronnie O'Sullivan won the previous year's championship by defeating fellow countryman Ali Carter in the final 18–11. The winner of the 2013 event earned prize money of £250,000, from a pool of £1,111,000. Sports betting company Betfair sponsored the event for the first time in 2013.\nFormat.\nThe 2013 World Snooker Championship was held between 20 April and 6 May 2013 in Sheffield, England. It was the last of 11 rankings events in the 2012–13 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. The tournament featured a 32-player main draw that took place at the Crucible Theatre and a 92-player qualifying draw that was played on 6 and 11 April 2015 at the English Institute of Sport. This was the 45th successive world championship to be contested using the knockout format after reverting from a challenge match system in the 1960s.\nOrdinarily the top-16 players in the world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Despite not playing a competitive event since the last world championship, Ronnie O'Sullivan was seeded first overall as the defending champion; the remaining 15 seeds were allocated using the latest world rankings, which were released after the China Open, the penultimate event of the season. The number of frames needed to win a match increased with each round of the main draw, starting with best-of-19-frames matches in the first round and ending with the final, which was played as a best-of-35-frames match.\nPrize fund.\nThe event had a prize fund of £1,111,000, of which the winner received £250,000. A breakdown of prize money for 2013 is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 20 and 25 April 2013; matches were held as the best-of-19 frames over two . Players Jack Lisowski, Michael White, Ben Woollaston, Dechawat Poomjaeng, Matthew Selt and Sam Baird made their debuts at the main stages of the event. Poomjaeng was only the third player from Thailand, after James Wattana and Tai Pichit, to reach the event. Two of the debuting players progressed to the second round; Michael White advanced by defeating two-time champion Mark Williams 10–6, while Dechawat Poomjaeng advanced by beating Stephen Maguire 10–9.\nFour Chinese players—a record for the event—had played in the 2012 competition but Ding Junhui was the only Chinese player to appear in 2013. Ding defeated Alan McManus 10–5 to reach the second round. Peter Ebdon was playing in his 22nd consecutive World Championship, equalling the number of consecutive appearances made by Steve Davis and putting him third for consecutive appearances behind Stephen Hendry on 27 and O'Sullivan on 26. In a repeat of the final of the 2006 event, Ebdon faced Graeme Dott; the match overran and was played over three sessions. Dott was ahead 8–6 after the second session and eventually won 10–6. The match lasted for more than seven hours; Ebdon had a high break of 37. Dott criticised Ebdon for his perceived slow play and called for a rule to limit the time a player could spend over a shot.\nThe ending of the match between defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan and Marcus Campbell was not aired on the BBC, which instead broadcast a repeat episode of the 1970s sitcom \"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\". The match was also unavailable on the BBC Red Button service, leading to viewers expressing their anger on social networks. The CEO of World Snooker Barry Hearn, apologised to fans on Twitter and wrote a formal letter of complaint to the BBC. O'Sullivan won the match 10–4; he had only played one competitive match in the minor-ranking PTC event since winning the title the year before. O'Sullivan said he wanted to \"take some time off\" and had refused to sign the player's contract for the following season.\nRobert Milkins defeated the 2010 champion Neil Robertson 8–10. Robertson made the highest break of the event—a 143 in frame six—and led 5–2 but Milkins tied the match at 8–8 before winning the next two frames. In other matches, four-time champion John Higgins lost 6–10 to Mark Davis whilst former finalist Matthew Stevens lost 7–10 to qualifier Marco Fu.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played between 25 and 30 April as the best of 25 frames over three sessions. Shaun Murphy defeated Graeme Dott 13–11 after leading 6–2 after the first session. Dott's elimination meant there were no Scottish players in the last eight for the first time since 1988. Michael White reached his first ranking event quarter-final by defeating Poomjaeng 13–3 after two of the three scheduled sessions. In the fourth frame, Poomjaeng used the to bridge over the but missed a on three occasions and forfeited the frame.\nO'Sullivan became the first defending champion since Murphy in 2006 to reach the quarter-finals when he defeated Ali Carter, his opponent in the 2008 and 2012 World Championship finals, 13–8. Ricky Walden, in his first world championship second-round appearance, defeated Robert Milkins 13–11. Milkins trailed 3–9 but recovered to 10–11 and 11–12 but Walden won the frame he needed for victory. Barry Hawkins also reached his first Crucible quarter-final after defeating world number one Mark Selby 13–10.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 31 April and 1 May as best-of-25 frames matches over three sessions. In his match against Stuart Bingham, O'Sullivan won 11 of the first 12 frames and won the match 13–4 in the first frame of the third session. Judd Trump trailed 3–8 against Shaun Murphy but tied the score at 12–12 to force a . The final frame lasted 53 minutes and was won by Trump. Ricky Walden defeated Michael White 13–6 and Hawkins defeated Ding Junhui 13–7, eliminating the two remaining non-English competitors from the tournament. Walden reached the semi-finals of the World Championship on his third attempt, despite not having previously won a match in his earlier appearances in the main stages of the event in 2009 and 2011.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played between 2 and 4 May 2013 over four sessions as the best-of-33 frames. This was the third semi-finals round in the modern history of snooker in which all of the players were English. O'Sullivan played Judd Trump in the first semi-final; in the 23rd frame, O'Sullivan received a reprimand from referee Michaela Tabb for allegedly making an obscene gesture with his cue. A World Snooker spokesman later stated eyewitnesses had also observed O'Sullivan making an inappropriate gesture but it was not captured on camera. O'Sullivan defeated Trump 17–11 and became the first defending champion to reach the final since Ken Doherty in 1998. In the other semi-final, Barry Hawkins trailed Ricky Walden 8–12 but won nine of the next eleven frames to win 17–14.\nFinal.\nThe 2013 final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Barry Hawkins was played on 5 and 6 May as the best-of-35 frames over four sessions and officiated by Jan Verhaas.

O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century break at the Crucible Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries, and he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan won the third session by five frames to three to lead 15–10. O'Sullivan went on to win the final 18–12 to take his fifth world title and become the first defending champion to retain his title since Hendry in 1996 and the first player to score six century breaks in a world championship final.\nEight century breaks were scored in the final, equalling the record set in the 2002 final between Hendry and Peter Ebdon. At the age of 37, O'Sullivan became the oldest World Snooker Champion since 45-year-old Ray Reardon in 1978. This was O'Sullivan's fifth world championship but he did not rule out a similar season away from the tour, saying; \"I had my year out and enjoyed my year out. I intend to play in some small events. Come December or January I'll have a better idea of what I'm going to do.\" As world champion, O'Sullivan was awarded a wild card place at the 2014 Masters, which he also won.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round.

        "text": "Rugby League British Columbia (or the RLBC), formerly known as British Columbia Rugby League, is a non-profit organization and a member of Canada Rugby League. RLBC operates a domestic rugby league football competition in British Columbia, Canada that currently features six teams with the addition of the Whistler Wolves for the 2020 season. The RLBC, with its clubs, additionally host events and competitions involving junior club teams and women's team to expand the sport of Rugby League in the province.\nTeams.\nThe RLBC competition started in May 2012 with 5 teams, Bayside Sharks, Burnaby Lake Rugby Club, Kelowna Crows, Sea to Sky Eagles and Surrey Beavers. The RLBC operates such that its member clubs are responsible for developing teams for the purposes of competing against other clubs. Since 2012, the men's competition has expanded to 6 teams making it the largest domestic rugby league competition in Canada. The season includes the regular season, culminating in the Grand Final, and a Rugby league nines tournament prior to the regular season.\nIn 2020, the Vancouver Dragons and Valley Warriors developed women's teams and the RLBC was prepared for delivery of the country's first intraprovincial women's competition. The clubs are the primary source for the province's representative teams.\nHistory.\nIn 2012, the Surrey Beavers played against Kelowna Crows in the Grand Final winning 20 to 4 to then go on to the Premier's Challenge to take on the BC Selects (reserve grade team of the BC Bulldogs). The BC Selects defeated Surrey Beavers 28 to 6. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, Burnaby Lake Rugby Club withdrew from the competition.\nIn 2013, RLBC announced the expansion of the competition to include a further 2 teams, Richmond Bears Rugby League Club and the Vancouver Dragons Rugby League Football Club. However, the expansion was met with 4 of the original six Clubs stepping away from the competition (although 2 would return in the future). The Grand Final pitted the previous season champions against the Sea to Sky Eagles-based out of Squamish. The Surrey Beavers were victorious.\nIn 2015, the Coastal Cougars (playing as the Capilano Cougars) were the top-placed team after going undefeated all season and defeated the Vancouver Dragons in the Grand Final 30 to 6.\nIn 2016, the Coastal Cougars again went undefeated and won the Grand Final over the Abbotsford Griffins by a score of 48–12.\nIn 2017, the Coastal Cougars lost their 2nd week match meaning the end of a remarkable winning streak that took them through over 2 seasons and ultimately ended at 12 wins in a row. In the Grand Final, the Valley Warriors laid claim to their first Grand Final Championship with a 20–0 win over the Kelowna Roosters, a founding member, who returned for play in 2017 and then subsequently ceased operations.\nIn 2018, the Vancouver Dragons collected their first Grand Final Championship with a narrow 26 to 24 over perennial powerhouse Coastal Cougars.\nIn 2019, the Point Grey Thunder qualified for their first Grand Final after a semi-final win over the Valley Warriors by a score of 34–14. In the final, however, they lost to the Coastal Cougars by a score of 38–28.\nIn 2020, the league expanded to include the Whistler Wolves and added two clubs, the Vancouver Dragons and Valley Warriors, established women's teams to compete. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was unable to start.\nStructure and finance.\nRugby League Clubs in the RLBC are incorporated societies and operate independently under the auspices of the RLBC and Canada Rugby League, or are post-secondary affiliated clubs.\nCurrently the RLBC is a self-funded entity and relies heavily on the contributions made by players and sponsors to help pay for the cost of league operations and representative teams.\nRepresentative squads.\nRLBC players consist of the men's team, the British Columbia Bulldogs and women's team, the British Columbia Storm. Players from the RLBC also make up the Western Canada Wild, a regional representative squad for the provinces of Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia for both men and women. In 2020, the Western Canada Wild met the representative team for Eastern Canada in the \"Thunderdome\" at Lamport Stadium in Toronto, Ontario. The \"thunderdome\" being an event similar to the popular State of Origin series in Australia in which the teams are composed of the best players representing regions. In the inaugural Thunderdome, the Western Canada Wild women defeated Eastern Canada 24-18 while the men lost to Eastern Canada 14–44.\nBC Bulldogs - Recent Fixtures\nThe roster for the BC Bulldogs against their provincial rival Alberta Broncos on September 2, 2018 is below.\nBC Storm - Recent Fixtures\nThe roster for the BC Storm as of September 1, 2019 when they took on the Alberta Broncos is below."

        "text": "The 1967 New Zealand rugby union tour of Great Britain, France and Canada was a tour undertaken by the New Zealand national rugby union team (the All Blacks). The series consisted of 17 matches, four of Test status against international opposition. The New Zealand team finished the tour undefeated, the first time they had achieved this in the Northern hemisphere since the 1924–25 Invincible team.\nTour.\nThe 1967 tour was hastily arranged, as New Zealand originally intended to tour South Africa. That was called off due to apartheid issues over the Māori members of the New Zealand side, and Britain was chosen as an alternative. This resulted in difficulties arranging matches against club opposition, a tradition of earlier tours, with non-Test games now played solely against regional teams.\nThe tour captain was Brian Lochore and the 30-man team was managed by former Kiwis' captain Charles Saxton. The tour began in North America, where the All Blacks played two matches, against British Columbia and Eastern Canada. The tourists then travelled to Great Britain where they faced several regional teams along with two Test matches against England and Wales. This was followed by four matches in France, one against the French national team, before returning to Britain to play three games in Scotland, where they played the final Test of the tour against Scotland. They completed the tour with a return to Wales, beating Monmouthshire and then drawing against an East Wales team, before the final fixture against the Barbarians.\nThe All Blacks should also have played matches in Ireland, including a test match against Ireland on 16 December but they were forced to cancel this section of the tour because of the 1967 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak. The Irish government banned them from travelling to Ireland, and the tour schedule was re-arranged. The All Blacks also had to burn all their kit before leaving London at the end of the tour."

        "text": "Nine of ten members of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) have competed in the men's FIFA World Cup finals. National association football teams from CONMEBOL have won the tournament ten times, including Brazil's record five championships. CONMEBOL countries have hosted the finals five times.\nResults.\nTeam results by tournament.\nThe team ranking in each tournament is according to FIFA. The rankings, apart from the top four positions (top two in 1930), are not a result of direct competition between the teams; instead, teams eliminated in the same round are ranked by their full results in the tournament.\nFor each tournament, the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown.\nOverall team records.\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws. 3 points per win, 1 point per draw and 0 points per loss.\nAppearances.\nNot qualified.\nVenezuela is the only one of the ten active FIFA and CONMEBOL members that have never qualified for the final tournament.\nSummary of performance.\nFor each World Cup, the number of countries in the finals (No.), the number of entries from around the world including any rejections and withdrawals (E), the number of South American entries (SA), how many of those South American entries withdrew before or during qualification or were rejected by FIFA (W), the South American representatives at the World Cup finals, the number of World Cup Qualifiers each South American representative had played to get to the finals (WCQ), the furthest stage they reached, their results, and their coaches.\nPerformance at individual World Cups.\n1930s: The inaugural FIFA World Cup, Uruguay's triumph.\nThe 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national association football association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body selected Uruguay as host nation as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and Uruguay had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. The first World Cup was the only one without a qualification process; seven teams from South America participated in the tournament.\nThe 1930 FIFA World Cup Final was contested by the finalists from the 1928 Olympics, Uruguay and Argentina. The final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. The gates were opened at 8:00, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full with an official attendance of 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams disagreed on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. The game ended 4–2 to Uruguay (who had trailed 2–1 at half time) who added the title World Cup winners to the mantle of Olympic Champions, as Jules Rimet, president of FIFA, presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named after him.\n1934–1938: World Cup without champions, third place for Brazil.\nThe 1934 World Cup is the only tournament in which the reigning champions did not participate. Reigning World Cup holders Uruguay declined to participate in protest at the refusal of several European countries to travel to South America for the 1930 World Cup, which Uruguay had hosted. Argentina and Brazil were the only South Americans nations to participate.\nThe 1938 World Cup was the last one to be staged before the outbreak of World War II. The decision to hold the 1938 tournament in France was controversial, as the American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay therefore boycotted the tournament. Only Brazil participated from South America, finishing in third place after a 4–2 victory against Sweden.\n1950: World Cup in Brazil, Uruguay's second triumph.\nThe 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the fourth FIFA World Cup and the only one not decided by a one-match final. Argentina, Ecuador and Peru in South America withdrew after the qualifying draw (in Argentina's case because of a dispute with the (Brazilian Football Confederation). This meant that Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay qualified from South America by default.\nThe final group stage involved the teams who had won their groups: Brazil, Spain, Sweden and 1930 champions Uruguay, who were making their first World Cup appearance since winning the inaugural tournament. The World Cup winners would be the team that managed to finish on top of this group. The final group's six matches were shared between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Brazil played all its final group matches at the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio, while the games that didn't involve the host nation were played in São Paulo. Brazil won their first two matches with a 7–1 thrashing of Sweden and 6–1 rout of Spain. Eventually, Brazil progressed to the final round, facing Uruguay in the final match of the tournament on 16 July 1950. Brazil only needed a draw to finish top of the group, but Uruguay won the game 2–1, shocking and silencing the hundred thousands who attended the game. This defeat on home soil is a significant event in Brazilian history, being known popularly as the \"Maracanazo\". The official attendance of the game was 199,854, with the actual attendance estimated to be about 210,000.\n1954: Postponed dreams.\nAs title holders, Uruguay qualified automatically for the 1954 World Cup. Only three teams from South America participated in qualification; Brazil was the only team to qualify for the main tournament. In the quarter-finals, they lost 2–4 to Hungary, while Uruguay obtained fourth place, losing the third place play-off 1–3 to Austria.\n1958–1962: Brazilian domination, 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile.\nThree South American nations – Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil – participated in the 1958 World Cup. Argentina appeared for the first time since 1934, while this would be Paraguay's last finals appearance until 1986. The tournament was won by Brazil, who beat Sweden 5–2 in the final to obtain their first title. To date, this marks the only occasion that a World Cup staged in Europe was not won by a European team. This final also bears many records in World Cup history. Pelé became the youngest player to play at a World Cup finals, the youngest scorer in a World Cup final and the youngest player to win a World Cup winners' medal. The team of the tournament voted by journalists consisted of five Brazil players:\nThe 1962 World Cup was held in Chile and was the third World Cup held in South America. Five South American nations participated. The tournament was again won by Brazil, who claimed their second title after defeating Czechoslovakia 3–1 in the final, becoming the second team to successfully defend its World title, since Italy achieved the same feat in 1938. Hosts Chile beat Yugoslavia 1–0 to finish the tournament in third place.\n1966: Search for the guilty.\nAt the 1966 World Cup, four South American nations participated. Argentina and Uruguay lost in the quarter-final, while Brazil and Chile were eliminated after the group stage. During that controversial game (for more details see Argentina and England football rivalry), Argentina's Antonio Rattín became the first player to be sent off in a senior international football match at Wembley Stadium. Rattín at first refused to leave the field and eventually had to be escorted by several policemen. After 30 minutes, England scored the only goal of the match. This game is known as \"el robo del siglo\" (the robbery of the century) in Argentina. It is one of the worst championship by results for the South American nations.\nSouth American protesters claimed that England, as hosts, had rigged the entire tournament with the help of West Germany. They particularly complained about the referees. English officials refereed most of Brazil's games. The England–Argentina match was refereed by a German; it was a bad-tempered match and the England manager, Alf Ramsay, described the Argentines afterwards as \"animals\". Meanwhile, the West Germany–Uruguay match had an English referee who sent off two Uruguayans after a handball by Karl-Heinz Schnellinger was disregarded by the English referee.\n1970: The greatest World Cup team ever.\nThree South Americans participated in the 1970 World Cup. Peru qualified for the first time, having made one previous appearance in the 1930 tournament (which did not require qualification). The 1970 World Cup won by Brazil, who beat Italy 4–1 in the final. With their third World Cup triumph, Brazil were allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently. In the semi-final, Brazil defeated Uruguay 3–1, finally exacting revenge for their defeat in the 1950 World Cup final. The Brazilian squad, led by Carlos Alberto, and featuring Pelé, Clodoaldo, Gérson, Jairzinho, Rivellino and Tostão, is often regarded as the greatest ever World Cup team.\n1974: New conspiracy theory.\nFour nations participated in the 1974 World Cup. For qualification, the nine South American nations were divided into three groups of three teams each, as Brazil qualified automatically as holders; Argentina, Chile, Uruguay also qualified for the tournament. Brazil finished in fourth place, while Argentina was eliminated in the second round, and Chile and Uruguay in the first round. Carlos Caszely of Chile became the first player to be sent off with a red card in a World Cup opening match. João Havelange, president of FIFA from 1974 to 1998, claimed that the 1966 and 1974 World Cups were fixed so that England and Germany would win respectively. He stated, \"We were the best in the world, and had the same team that had won the World Cup in 1962 in Chile and 1970 in Mexico, but it was planned for the host countries to win.\"\n1978: The first Argentina World Cup title.\nThe 1978 World Cup, the 11th staging of the tournament, was held in Argentina, marking the fourth time the World Cup was hosted in South America. Three South American nations participated in the tournament: Argentina, Brazil and Peru. The tournament was won by Argentina who beat the Netherlands 3–1 after extra time in the final. This win was the first World Cup title for Argentina. Controversy surrounded the hosts, however, as all of their games in the first round kicked off at night, giving the Argentines the advantage of knowing where they stood in the group. This issue would arise again in Spain 1982, which prompted FIFA to change the rules so that the final two group games in subsequent World Cups would be played simultaneously.\nIn 1978, Argentina needed to beat Copa América holders Peru by four clear goals to reach the final ahead of Brazil. They won 6–0 but there were dark rumours that Peru, who had an Argentine-born goalkeeper, had thrown the game. There are several allegations that the Argentine government struck a deal with the Peruvian government that ensured Argentina would proceed to the final. The deal allegedly encompassed delivery of a large grain shipment to Peru by Argentina and the unfreezing of a Peruvian bank account that was held by the Argentine Central Bank. In exchange, the Peruvian team had to allow Argentina to win in their second-round match with a margin that was large enough to go the next round. That margin was four goals.\nThe final, Argentina–Netherlands, was also controversial, as the Dutch accused the Argentines of using stalling tactics to delay the match. Mario Kempes opened the scoring for the hosts before Dick Nanninga equalized a few minutes from the end. Rob Rensenbrink had a glorious stoppage-time opportunity to win it for the Netherlands, but his effort came back off the goal post. Argentina won the final 3–1 after extra time. The Netherlands, because of the controversial game events, refused to attend the post-match ceremonies after the match ended. Brazil took third place from an enterprising Italy side with Nelinho scoring a memorable goal, and were dubbed \"moral champions\" by coach Cláudio Coutinho as although they did not win the tournament, they did not lose a single match.\n1982: The \"Sarrià Stadium Tragedy\".\nFour South American nations participated in the 1982 World Cup: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru. This was the last time Peru qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals until 2018. The tournament was the first for Diego Maradona, but defending champions Argentina lost opening match 0–1 to Belgium, although they would qualify to the second round. Brazil, with Zico, Sócrates, Falcão, Éder and others in their squad, boasted an offensive firepower that promised a return to the glory days of 1970. They defeated the Soviet Union 2–1 thanks to a 20-metre Éder goal two minutes from time, then Scotland and New Zealand with four goals each.\nPeru and Chile finished fourth in their groups and were therefore eliminated early. In the second round, Italy prevailed 2–1 over Argentina, with Italian defenders Gaetano Scirea and Claudio Gentile proving themselves equal to the task of stopping the Argentine attack. With the loss, Argentina needed a win over Brazil on the second day, but fell 3–1, with Argentina only scoring in the last minute. Notably, Maradona kicked Brazilian player João Batista in the groin and was sent off in the 85th minute. The Brazil–Italy match 3–2 for Italy, with Italian striker Paolo Rossi scoring a hat-trick. The result eliminated Brazil from the tournament. The result was seen by many as not only a defeat for Brazil, but a defeat of their attacking philosophy by the less talented but more organised Italians.\nThis match has since then been labelled by Brazilian press as the 'Sarrià Stadium Tragedy' (br: A tragédia do Sarriá)\n1986: Argentina's second World Cup title.\nColombia had been originally chosen to host the competition by FIFA, but, largely due to economic reasons, was not able to do so and officially resigned in 1982. Mexico was selected as the new host in May 1983. At the 1986 World Cup, four nations South American nations participated: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The tournament was won by Argentina (their second title, after also winning in 1978), captained by Maradona, who scored the infamous \"Hand of God goal\", and also a goal voted as \"Goal of the Century\", in the same quarter-final against England. These were two of the five goals that Maradona scored during the tournament; he also created another five for his teammates. Argentina beat West Germany 3–2 in the final at Mexico City's Estadio Azteca.\nThe first round of the finals began in Group A, where Argentina beat South Korea 3–1, with Maradona playing a major part. Italy and Argentina drew 1–1, Maradona and Alessandro Altobelli scoring. The final set of matches saw Argentina beating Bulgaria 2–0.\nParaguay in Group B won 1–0 over Iraq and subsequently drew both Mexico and Belgium. Group D saw Brazil start 1–0 over Spain, 1–0 over Algeria, and 3–0 over Northern Ireland. Uruguay qualified in the second round only two points and goal difference of –5.\nIn the rematch of the 1930 World Cup final, Argentina just edged out South American champions Uruguay in Puebla thanks to a 42nd-minute strike from Pedro Pasculli. Brazil progressed to the quarter-finals comfortably when they saw off Poland 4–0, while Paraguay lost England 0–3.\nIn the quarter-finals, three-time world champion Brazil faced France in Guadalajara. Brazil were well on top in the early stages, and Careca put them one up after 18 minutes. Five minutes before half-time, however, France drew level when Michel Platini scored his 41st goal after converting a cross from Dominique Rocheteau. Brazil had a chance to regain the lead in the second half when Branco was fouled by French keeper Joël Bats in the penalty area. Zico took the penalty, but Bats saved it. The match proceeded into extra time, and France had the better of the extra half-hour. No goals were scored, and so it was time for a penalty shoot-out. Sócrates, who had earlier missed an open goal and headed an easy chance straight into the French goalkeeper's arms, failed with the first kick for Brazil. The next six penalties were all converted, followed by Platini firing over the bar. Brazil were back on level terms, but not for long: Júlio César struck the post with his penalty, whereupon Luis Fernández then scored to put France through 4–3 on penalties.\nThe quarter-final between Argentina and England was featured two very different goals by Diego Maradona: the first was scored illegally, as he punched the ball into the goal past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. The referee did not see the handball and the goal was given as valid. After the game, Maradona claimed the goal was scored \"A bit with the head of Maradona and another bit with the hand of God\"; it therefore became known as the \"Hand of God\" goal. For his second goal, voted \"Goal of the Century\" in 2002 on the FIFA website, Maradona dribbled half the length of the field past five English players before scoring. In Argentina, the game was seen as revenge for the Falklands War.\nIn the other semi-final, meanwhile, Maradona struck twice in the second half as Argentina beat Belgium 2–0. In the final against West Germany, José Luis Brown put Argentina one up midway through the first half of the final, and when Jorge Valdano scored a second for the South Americans in the 55th minute, Argentina looked to be strolling to victory. West Germany then staged a spirited comeback. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge pulled one back in the 74th minute, and six minutes later Rudi Völler hit the equaliser. With seven minutes remaining, a pass from Maradona gave Jorge Burruchaga the chance to score the winner for Argentina. Eight years on from their home triumph, Argentina regained the world title and 30 million people in Argentina celebrated in the streets after the final victory. Maradona was the Golden Ball winner as the best player of the tournament.\n1990: Chile incident, Argentina reaches Final.\nFour South American nations participated in the 1990 World Cup: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. One of the most bizarre incidents in World Cup history occurred on 3 September 1989. During the Brazil–Chile CONMEBOL qualifying match in Rio de Janeiro, Chile needed victory to retain any hope of qualification, but trailed 0–1 to Brazil. Around 20 minutes into the second half, Chile goalkeeper Roberto Rojas fell to the pitch with an apparent injury to his forehead. A firework, thrown from the stands by a Brazilian fan named Rosemary de Mello, was smouldering about a yard away. After carrying Rojas off the pitch, the Chilean players and coaches refused to return claiming conditions were not safe, and the match went unfinished. After studying video footage of the match showing that the firework had not made contact with Rojas, FIFA awarded Brazil a 2–0 win, eliminating Chile from the 1990 World Cup. As punishment, Chile were barred from the qualifying process for the 1994 World Cup, and Rojas was banned for life, though the ban was lifted in 2001.\nArgentina lost its first game 0–1 to Cameroon, then defeated the Soviet Union 2–0 and drew 1–1 with Romania, finishing third in its group as one of the tournament's best third-placed teams. Brazil took maximum points in its group, winning 2–1 over Sweden, 1–0 over Costa Rica and 1–0 over Scotland. Colombia and Uruguay also qualified to the second round.\nThe all-South American match in the second round was won for Argentina by a goal from Claudio Caniggia with ten minutes remaining after a run through the Brazilian defence by Diego Maradona and an outstanding performance from goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea. Uruguay lost 0–2 to Italy, while Colombia lost 1–2 after extra time to Cameroon.\nArgentina reached the semi-finals after a goalless stalemate and winning the penalty shoot-out 3–2, despite Maradona having his penalty saved. A second Argentine miss (by Pedro Troglio) looked to have eliminated them until goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea – playing because first choice Nery Pumpido broke his leg during the group stage – rescued his side by stopping the Yugoslavs' final two spotkicks.\nThe first semi-final pitted the host nation Italy against world champions Argentina. Salvatore Schillaci scored to put Italy ahead in the 17th minute, but Claudio Caniggia equalised midway through the second half, There were no further goals, but a series of serious fouls saw five yellow cards and a red issued, largely to Argentina: the game went to a shootout which Argentina won 4–3, after Roberto Donadoni and Aldo Serena both had their kicks saved by Goycochea. Argentina's decisive penalty had been converted by Maradona, who, playing in his club \"home city\" of Naples, had urged locals to support him rather than their homeland, creating a more muted atmosphere than Italy's previous games in Rome.\nThe final between West Germany and Argentina has been cited as the most cynical and lowest quality of all World Cup finals. In the 65th minute, Argentina's Pedro Monzón was sent off for a foul on Jürgen Klinsmann, the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup final.\nArgentina, weakened by suspension and injury, offered little attacking threat throughout a contest dominated by the West Germans, who struggled to create many clear goalscoring opportunities. The only goal of the contest arrived in the 84th minute when Mexican referee Edgardo Codesal awarded a penalty to West Germany, after a foul on Rudi Völler by Roberto Sensini. Andreas Brehme, who later said there was no foul, converted the spot kick to settle the contest. In the closing moments, Argentina were reduced to nine after Gustavo Dezotti received the second red card of the game when he hauled Jürgen Kohler to the ground during a stoppage in play. The 1–0 scoreline provided another first: Argentina were the first team to fail to score in a World Cup final.\n1994: Bolivia returns to the World Cup, Colombian tragedy, Brazil's fourth World Cup title.\nFour South American nations participated in the 1994 World Cup: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia. Chile could not take part in qualification as it was still banned by FIFA; Bolivia had qualified for the first time since the 1950 tournament. The tournament saw the end of Diego Maradona's World Cup career, having played in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups. He was expelled from the tournament after he failed a drug test which uncovered ephedrine, a weight loss drug, in his blood. Colombia, despite high expectations due to their style and impressive qualifying campaign, disappointed in the tournament, failing to advance from the round robin. The team was supposedly dogged by influence from betting syndicates and drug cartels, with coach Francisco Maturana receiving death threats over squad selection. Defender Andrés Escobar was a tragic figure of this tournament, as in the group stage match against the United States national team, he scored an own goal which eliminated his team 2–1. Escobar was later shot to death outside a bar in a Medellín suburb only ten days after the match, apparently in retaliation for the own goal.\nColombia finished top of their qualifying group without having lost a match, which included a historic 5–0 win over Argentina in Buenos Aires. Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favourites to win the tournament. The match in Group A between Colombia and Romania was the first game for either side in the group phase; Colombia lost 1–3 to Romania. The team went into their second group game against the United States knowing they had to win to have any chance of progressing. In the 35th minute, Andrés Escobar attempted to cut out a cross but accidentally deflected the ball into his own net. Earnie Stewart took the Americans two goals in front after scoring in the 56th minute. Iván Valenciano scored a consolation goal for Colombia in the closing minutes of the match. Colombia did, however, win their final group match 2–0 over Switzerland, but it was not enough to ensure progression.\nIn Group B, Brazil won over Russia, Cameroon also one draw against Sweden and qualified Round of 16. Bolivia draw 0–0 against South Korea, lost 0–1 opening match Germany, 1–3 Spain. In the next stage did not qualify. Argentina collected a maximum of six points from their opening two matches after beating Greece 4–0 in Foxboro before coming from behind to overcome the feisty Nigerians 2–1 on the same field four days later, yet still only finished third, since lost 0–2 Bulgaria.\nArgentina, who were without Diego Maradona after he had been thrown out of the tournament for taking drugs, faced Romania in the second round. Romanian scored twice in the opening twenty minutes, with Gabriel Batistuta scoring a penalty on either side, but after half-time Romania netted a superb third goal on the counterattack, with Gheorghe Hagi beating goalkeeper Luis Islas. Abel Balbo pulled a goal back, but Romania held on for a shock win. Brazil advanced to the quarter-finals after winning 1–0 against hosting nations the United States. Brazil would normally be easily favoured, but the United States were playing at home, in their National Day. Leonardo was also sent off immediately, which increased Brazil's uncertainty. Later, Leonardo declared that he acted by instinct, without any intention to harm. Brazil won that match thanks to their usual system: Aldair and Márcio Santos effective in the defence, and Romário and Bebeto effective in the attack. Bebeto scored the sole goal after 28 minutes of second half.\nIn the quarter-finals, Brazil won against the Netherlands. For the second Brazilian goal, Romário was clearly offside in the buildup, but as he pretended he had not seen the ball, the referee considered that Romário was not participating in the play, and Bebeto's goal stood. It seemed to be heading towards an easy 2–0 win for Brazil, but in ten minutes Netherlands scored two goals, levelling the match. Branco then scored from a long-range free kick to restore Brazil's lead. Branco, a veteran of the team who had participated in the 1986 and 1990 tournaments, was much admired by the Brazilian fans for his braveness. FIFA considered this Brazil - Netherlands match to be a classic.\nBrazil won their semi-final against Sweden 1–0; after Jonas Thern had been sent off for Sweden, Romário scored the only goal of the game in the 80th minute.\nBrazil and Italy contested the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. This time, not even Romário could help Brazil win. For the first time in the history of the tournament, the final ended in a 0–0, and had to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. A large reason for the lack of goals was because both Brazil and Italy had a scheme which prioritised first the defence, and, luck allowing, the attack. Brazil won the shoot-out, with the Italians missing three of their four attempts. Brazil was thus declared world champions for a fourth time. The trophy was handed to captain Dunga by U.S. vice-president Al Gore. Brazil's Romário, with five goals, won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. Brazilians refer to this tournament as the cup that Romário won for Brazil.\n1998: Brazil too weak in the final.\nAt the 1998 FIFA World Cup, five nations of South America participated: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Paraguay, with Paraguay qualifying for the first time since 1986. Following Brazil's wins over Scotland and Morocco, they were confirmed as group winners with a game to spare. Chile conceded equalisers in all of their games, but their three draws were still enough for them to qualify in second place and advance to the knockout stage with a record-low three points. Paraguay drew their first two group games 0–0 and then beat Nigeria 3–1 to advance in second place. After two matchdays in their group, England and Colombia were level on points prior to their final group game against each other. Colombia lost the match 0–2 and were eliminated. Argentina advanced with a match to spare after they beat Japan and Jamaica, with Gabriel Batistuta scoring in both games. Argentina then beat Croatia to take first place in the group.\nIn the round of 16, Chile played against South American rivals Brazil at the Parc des Princes in Paris. César Sampaio scored twice for Brazil early on, and a Ronaldo penalty made it 3–0 before half-time. Chile kept fighting, and Salas got his fourth goal of the competition, heading in a rebound after Cláudio Taffarel had saved a shot from Zamorano, but Ronaldo then quickly scored a fourth for Brazil as Chile were sent out of the tournament. Argentina's round of 16 match against England remained at 2–2 until the end of extra time. In the ensuing penalty shoot-out that decided the game, Argentina won 4–3 after two English shots were saved by Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Roa. Paraguay lost their second round match to France, with the only goal coming through Laurent Blanc in the 114th minute, during the second half of extra time, the first ever golden goal scored at a World Cup. In the quarter-finals, Argentina lost 1–2 against the Netherlands after conceding in the 89th minute. Moments after Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega had been sent off for head-butting Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, evening the teams at ten men a side, Dutch captain Frank de Boer launched a 60-yard pass directly to the right foot of Bergkamp on the right side of the penalty area. With his first touch, the striker known as \"The Iceman\" cut back to his left past defender Roberto Ayala. With his second touch, Bergkamp tucked a hard shot over keeper Carlos Roa into the top left corner. In the other quarter-final involving a South American side, Denmark put up much more of a battle than many thought possible, but in the end, with two goals from Rivaldo, defending World Cup holders Brazil pulled out a 3–2 victory at the La Beaujoire Stadium. In the 60th minute, Rivaldo netted the final and decisive goal, finding the bottom right corner of the net from twenty yards.\nBrazil faced the Netherlands in the semi-finals. Ronaldo scored in the 46th minute for Brazil, and Patrick Kluivert equalized for the Dutch in the 87th minute. A surprisingly tame match ended 1–1 after 120 minutes. Goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel made two diving saves in the shoot-out for Brazil as they defeated the Netherlands 4–2 on penalties and advanced to the final.\nBrazil, who were the defending champions having won the previous World Cup four years earlier in 1994, contested the final against host nation France, who had reached the final of the tournament for the first time. France won the match 3–0 to claim the World Cup for the first time, with the timing of the match two days before Bastille Day adding to the significance of the victory. Zinedine Zidane, who was named man of the match, scored twice before half-time and Emmanuel Petit added a third goal in the last minute. The match had an attendance in the region of 75,000. The match also saw speculation on the condition of the Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who had suffered a convulsive fit on the eve of the match. After initially being left out of the team sheet, in spite of his physical state, it was announced just 72 minutes before kick-off that Ronaldo would play. In the match, he sustained an injury in a clash with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Although it was believed that the decision to play Ronaldo had backfired, it was understandable as the player had been a crucial member of the side throughout the tournament, having scored four goals and created three more. The final was also the heaviest defeat inflicted on Brazil since 1930.\n2002: Ecuador debut, Brazil's fifth World Cup title.\nAt the 2002 FIFA World Cup, five nations from South America participated: Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Ecuador making their World Cup finals debut. Paraguay's first match in their group was a 2–2 draw with South Africa, with their goals coming from Roque Santa Cruz and Francisco Arce. They then lost 1–3 to Spain in their second match before winning 3–1 over Slovenia, with a brace from Nelson Cuevas and a goal by Jorge Luis Campos, to qualify for the second round. The Brazilian team started the 2002 tournament with a 2–1 win against Turkey, followed by a 4–0 win against China and a 5–2 against Costa Rica, qualifying from the group stage with nine points out of nine. Argentina's first match in their group was a 1–0 win over Nigeria, and their second game a 0–1 defeat to England. Like favourites France, second-favourites Argentina were eliminated in the first round following a 1–1 draw to Sweden in their third game. Ecuador were drawn in Group G with Italy, Mexico and Croatia. They were knocked out in the group stage, despite achieving a 1–0 victory over Croatia, who had come third at the previous edition of the World Cup; Ecuador lost their other two group matches 0–2 to Italy and 1–2 to Mexico. Uruguay, as dark horses of the group, failed to impress, with their high point being a goalless draw with a sub-par France side. Despite managing to put three goals past Senegal in a high-scoring draw, a loss to Denmark in Uruguay's opening game had dashed any hopes they may have had of qualifying for the last 16.\nIn the second round, Germany ended Paraguay's World Cup dreams with an 88th-minute goal, while Brazil won 2–0 against Belgium. To the surprise of the Brazilians themselves, referee Peter Prendergast disallowed a contentious Belgian goal by Marc Wilmots that would have given his side a 1–0 lead. Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari declared after the tournament that the match against Belgium had been the hardest for Brazil to win.\nAgainst England in the quarter-finals, Brazil came from behind to win 2–1. Brazil's Ronaldinho caught out England goalkeeper David Seaman with a lobbed free kick from 42 yards to complete their comeback and see them advance into the final four. Ronaldinho also assisted teammate Rivaldo for Brazil's first goal, but was later sent off for stamping on the right ankle of England's Danny Mills.\nBrazil's semi-final match was against Turkey, a team they had already faced in their group. Again, this match was difficult, as Brazil narrowly won 1–0 with a goal by Ronaldo. Rivaldo had scored in all five games for his side.in the tournament leading up to this one, but failed to hit the target in the sixth. This ended his chance of repeating Jairzinho's achievement of scoring in every game of the World Cup for Brazil in 1970.\nThe final was between two of the most successful teams in the competition's history: Germany and Brazil. Incredibly, the teams had never played each other in the World Cup before, besides a match between Brazil and East Germany in the 1974 edition. German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn had been the tournament's best keeper, but was not able to keep out Brazil in the final, as Ronaldo vanquished his 1998 demons by scoring both goals in a 2–0 triumph. Ronaldo also won the Golden Shoe as the tournament's leading scorer, though Kahn was awarded the Golden Ball as the most outstanding player. This match also marked Brazilian captain Cafu's third appearance in a World Cup final, a feat that had yet to be accomplished by any other player in the history of the tournament. The title marked Brazil's fifth World Cup championship, more than any other nation had achieved, also becoming the first team to win all seven of their games in the tournament without the need for any extra time or penalty shoot-outs.\n2006: Ecuador reaches the Round of 16, Argentina and Brazil early finishes World Cup.\nAt the 2006 FIFA World Cup, four nations from South America participated: Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Paraguay. Ecuador were drawn into Group A with hosts Germany, Poland, and Costa Rica. Wins over Poland and Costa Rica earned \"La Tri\" qualification to the knockout stage for the first time. Paraguay was participating in its third World Cup in a row. This time, back-to-back 0–1 defeats in their opening two matches, against England and Sweden, sent the team home early. Paraguay's only consolation was a 2–0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in their third and final group game. Argentina qualified from Group C with a game to spare, topping the group on goal difference after hammering Serbia and Montenegro 6–0 and beating the Ivory Coast 2–1. The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in their group. Despite winning the first two games against Croatia (1–0) and Australia (2–0), Brazil didn't seem to play as well as expected and struggled to get past their opponents' defences. In Brazil's third game, manager Parreira tried a new squad with five former reserve players, including Robinho and Cicinho. The changes were successful, as the team managed a comfortable 4–1 win against Japan.\nIn the round of 16, Argentina struggled to break down Mexico, but nonetheless secured a 2–1 win thanks to a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time to put the Albiceleste into the quarter-finals. Ecuador were eliminated after losing 0–1 to England thanks to a David Beckham free kick. Brazil defeated Ghana 3–0 to advance, in a game which included Ronaldo's record fifteenth World Cup goal.\nThe quarter-final between Germany and Argentina ended 1–1 after extra time; the hosts edged out the Argentines 4–2 on penalties to go through to the semi-finals (this was the first time Argentina had lost a World Cup penalty shoot-out: up until this match, both Argentina and Germany had participated in three penalty shoot-outs, winning all of them). Argentina had scored first to grab a 1–0 lead. However, Michael Ballack's cross, flicked on by Tim Borowski, allowed Klose to head in the equalizer for Germany with ten minutes to spare. During the subsequent shoot-out, goalkeeper Jens Lehmann saved two shots while his teammates all scored to win the shoot-out 4–2. Brazil were also eliminated in the quarter-finals, after losing 0–1 against France. France was led by a rejuvenated Zinedine Zidane and by a strong defence which kept the Brazilian strikers under check for the duration of the game. Perhaps partially due to their uncommon formation, Brazil was shut out, attempting just one shot at French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. The game was also notable for being the first time that the Brazil team had been shut out in three consecutive matches against France, now holding a 2–1–1 all-time record in World Cup matches played in 1986, 1998 and 2006 against the side. Following their elimination, the Brazil team was largely criticized by the press and the fans. The media circulated images of the left wingback Roberto Carlos tying his shoes while Thierry Henry ran unmarked to score the winning goal. Sporting legend Pelé blamed coach Parreira and Ronaldinho for the team's early exit.\n2010: Uruguay's fourth place, Paraguay's best ever performance.\nAt the 2010 FIFA World Cup, five nations of South America participated: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile were playing at the finals tournament for the first time since 1998. The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the knockout stage (four as group winners). In Group A, despite a red card being given to Uruguay substitute Nicolás Lodeiro in the second half, Uruguay were able to hold a \"lacklustre\" France to a 0–0 draw. They then won 3–0 against hosts South Africa and 1–0 against Mexico. As group winners Uruguay advanced to face the runners-up from Group B, South Korea. In Group B, Argentina won all of their matches. As group winners, they advanced to face Mexico in the last 16, just as they had in the previous tournament. Paraguay topped Group F undefeated with five points and advanced to face Japan, the runners-up of Group E. Paraguay drew two group matches and won 2–0 against Slovakia. As winners of Group G, Brazil advanced to play against Chile – runners-up in Group H – in the Round of 16. Brazil had won 2–1 against North Korea, 3–1 against the Ivory Coast and drawn 0–0 with Portugal. Chile, the group runners-up, had won 1–0 against both Honduras and Switzerland, but then lost 1–2 to Spain.\nUruguay's match against South Korea was the first of the round of 16. Uruguay won the match 2–1, with both of their goals coming from Luis Suárez, the second of which broke a 1–1 deadlock in the 80th minute. Suárez's first was scored after Diego Forlán made a low cross from the left that was not dealt with by the Korean defence, leaving Suárez to score at the back post. Uruguay subsequently adopted a defensive posture and Korea had more chances to score. Suárez's second goal was regarded as one of the tournament's best. Argentina met Mexico at Soccer City, and won the match 3–1 to book a rematch in the quarter-finals against Germany. The game was overshadowed by a refereeing error that allowed Argentina's opening goal. Carlos Tevez headed the ball into the net from a Lionel Messi pass in the 25th minute, but replays showed there were no players between Tevez and the goal, rendering it clearly offside. Replays of the incident were shown in the stadium but the decision to award the goal was not overturned. Tevez later admitted he knew that he was offside, but chose not to say anything. Argentina's second goal came from a defensive error from Ricardo Osorio, as a poor pass out of defence was snatched by Gonzalo Higuaín to round the keeper and score. After half-time, Tevez scored his second goal of the match to give Argentina a three-goal lead, with a long range shot that found the top corner of the Mexican goal. Javier Hernández scored for Mexico in the 71st minute but it turned out to be no more than a consolation, as Argentina held on to win 3–1. Brazil soundly defeated Chile 3–0 to progress to a quarter-final matchup against the Netherlands. Brazil's first goal came from a corner kick taken by Maicon in the 34th minute, with Juan heading the ball into the goal without being marked. Brazil then doubled the lead within five minutes after a free-flowing passing movement involving Robinho and Kaká that teed up Luís Fabiano to score after taking the ball around the Chilean goalkeeper. Robinho himself sealed victory for Brazil in the second half, scoring following a long run with the ball from Ramires. Paraguay and Japan met at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium. The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out since the score was locked at 0–0 after 120 minutes. Paraguay won the shoot-out and progressed to their first ever World Cup quarter-final. The match was a generally unexciting affair, as Japan adopted a defensive posture while Paraguay also maintained a solid defence. The first half produced the occasional chance on goal with Lucas Barrios having a shot saved, shortly before a long-distance shot from Daisuke Matsui hit the crossbar of Paraguay's goal. The second half was similar, with either side producing occasional chances to score rather than periods of dominance. The result of the deadlock was extra time, which continued goalless. A shoot-out ensued, in which Yuichi Komano missed a spot kick for Japan. Paraguay scored all five of their penalties, clinching the win and passage to the quarter-finals.\nThe Netherlands faced Brazil in the first quarter-final match. The Dutch side won 2–1 after recovering from a 0–1 deficit in the second half, knocking the five-time world champions Brazil out of the tournament. Brazil's coach Dunga confirmed after the match that he would be leaving the position upon the expiry of his contract, admitting responsibility for Brazil's defeat. Uruguay and Ghana met at Soccer City for a place in the semi-finals against the Netherlands. It was the first time that the teams had ever played each other in a senior competitive football match. After a dramatic 120 minutes of play (including extra time) that finished 1–1, Uruguay won in a penalty shoot-out 4–2. Uruguay dominated the early periods of the match, but suffered an injury to captain Diego Lugano in the first half. Just before half-time, Ghana took the lead when Sulley Muntari was allowed time on the ball by Uruguay, and took advantage by scoring with a shot from 40 yards. After half-time, Diego Forlán pulled Uruguay level with a free kick from the left side of the field that went over the head of Ghana's goalkeeper Richard Kingson. While both teams had chances to win, the match proceeded to extra time as the scores remained level. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free kick into the area; Luis Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. On the rebound, Dominic Adiyiah's header was heading into the goal, but Suárez blocked the shot with his hands to save what would have been a last-minute winner and was dismissed. Asamoah Gyan missed the ensuing penalty kick off the crossbar and Suárez could be seen celebrating the miss. In the shoot-out, Gyan this time did convert his penalty, as did every other player until the fourth round of spot kicks, when Adiyiah's penalty was saved by Uruguayan goalkeeper Fernando Muslera. Uruguay's Maxi Pereira then hit his penalty over the bar. However, Muslera would then saved captain John Mensah's, and Ghana's fifth, penalty. Sebastián Abreu converted Uruguay's fifth penalty by lightly chipping it Panenka-style to win the match. After the game, Suárez stated, \"I made the save of the tournament,\" and, referring to the infamous handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup, claimed that \"The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me.\" Suárez argued he had no alternative and was acting out of instinct. Forlán agreed that Suárez saved the game: \"Suárez this time, instead of scoring goals, he saved one, I think he saved the game. In the other quarter-final, Germany thrashed Argentina 4–0. This defeat was Argentina's biggest loss at a World Cup since 1974. Spain then defeated Paraguay 1–0. The first half of the match finished goalless, although both sides had chances to score and Paraguay's Nelson Valdez had a goal ruled out for offside. The match suddenly became eventful in the second half due to a string of penalty kicks. First, Óscar Cardozo was pulled down by Gerard Piqué in Spain's penalty area and Paraguay was awarded a penalty. Cardozo took the kick himself but it was saved by Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain then launched an attack at the other end of the field, in which David Villa was ruled by the referee to have been brought down by Antolín Alcaraz. Xabi Alonso stepped up to take the penalty kick and seemed to have scored, only for the referee to order it to be retaken because of encroachment by a Spanish player into the penalty area before the kick was taken. Xabi Alonso's retake was saved by Paraguayan goalkeeper Justo Villar and as a result, the score remained 0–0. However, Spain ultimately managed to score the winner in the 82nd minute; David Villa collected a rebounded shot off the post from Pedro, to score himself off the post.\nUruguay played the Netherlands in the first semi-final, with the Netherlands winning the match 3–2. Uruguay adopted a defensive formation early in the match, but were only able to hold their opponents scoreless for eighteen minutes, when Dutch captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst scored from 35 yards into the top right corner of the goal. However, the Netherlands were unable to capitalise on their lead, as Diego Forlán equalised in the 41st minute after his shot from 25 yards hit squarely in the middle of the goal was misjudged by goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. The Netherlands regained the lead quickly, though, as a pass from Van der Vaart reached Sneijder who dished it into the side of the goal as Muslera dived and missed it by inches. Then, three minutes later, Kuyt crossed the ball to Robben, who headed it into the goal to make the match 3–1 for the Dutch. The Netherlands suffered a late scare when Maxi Pereira, who had missed a penalty in the shoot-out Ghana, scored in stoppage time from a free kick; however, the score remained 3–2 despite desperate Uruguayan attempts to equalise.\nIn the third place play-off, Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2. Bastian Schweinsteiger managed to take a shot towards the goal, which Muslera rebounded towards Thomas Müller, who tapped in the opener. Uruguay forced their way back into the game after Luis Suárez's pass put Edinson Cavani through on the left, with Cavani sliding the ball low into the far corner to put his side on level terms after 28 minutes. Diego Forlán then put Uruguay ahead six minutes into in the second half, with a strong backheel kick from the edge of the penalty area finding the net while goalkeeper Hans-Jörg Butt stayed rooted to the spot. Marcell Jansen then equalized for Germany on 56 minutes after Muslera came for Jérôme Boateng's cross but missed, allowing Jansen to head into an empty net. Mesut Özil then took a corner in the 82nd minute, which reached Khedira in the air after rebounding, who headed it in to restore Germany's lead. Uruguay almost forced extra time when Forlán curled a 92nd-minute free kick onto the bar, but Germany held on to win the match. After the game, Uruguay coach Óscar Tabárez stated \"We achieved an equal game against a real power, we could have won because in the game [they] were not superior to us, \"We're not that far away [from Germany's level], the route has been marked, we must learn from this\".\n2014: Drama for Brazil on home soil as Colombia shine and Argentina reach the final.\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup marked the fifth time the World Cup was hosted by a South American nation, with Brazil staging the tournament for the second time (the first instance being in 1950). Besides the hosts, five other CONMEBOL teams managed to qualify. Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Ecuador qualified directly via the qualification tournament, while Uruguay beat Jordan in the inter-continental play-offs. FIFA appointed Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, São Paulo, Salvador, Fortaleza, Recife, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Natal, Cuiabá and Manaus as host cities, with the final being played at the iconic Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil, victorious in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, were pre-tournament favourites, together with world champions Spain, Germany and their arch-rivals Argentina.\nThe months before the tournament were overshadowed by massive protests among many Brazilians, who accused Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and her government of setting questionable priorities by pouring loads of money into the World Cup, when issues such as healthcare and education were considered more important and in more urgent need of financial aid by many. They also claimed both the Brazilian government and the FIFA were corrupt and didn't take the people's wishes into account. The protests were supported by many, including Brazilian legendary footballer Romário. Further anger was caused by the fact that several workers had died while working on the construction sites of the new stadiums, especially in São Paulo and Manaus. The construction of many stadiums was delayed, and the Arena da Baixada in Curitiba was almost taken out of the tournament. Some stadiums remained unfinished by the time the competition started.\nThe group stage kicked off on 12 June 2014, with Brazil taking on Croatia in São Paulo. The opening goal of the tournament was an own goal by Brazilian defender Marcelo, who became the first Brazilian ever to score an own goal at the FIFA World Cup. However, Brazil managed to turn the game around and eventually won 3–1. Brazil's second goal, scored by poster boy Neymar, was a controversially awarded penalty kick, which eventually led to the exclusion of Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura from the remainder of the tournament. In their following group game, Brazil suffered a minor setback when they drew 0–0 against Mexico in Fortaleza, but they restored their supremacy with a resounding 4–1 victory over Cameroon in Brasília to secure top of the table in Group A.\nIn Group B, Chile faced world champions Spain, 2010 runners-up the Netherlands, and AFC minnows Australia, whom they managed to defeat 3–1 in their opening game in Cuiabá. The Chileans then managed to knock out the title holders in Rio de Janeiro, winning 2–0 with goals from Eduardo Vargas and Charles Aránguiz, only to go down by the same score in their final group match in São Paulo against the Netherlands, thus ending second in their group and going through to the round of 16.\nGroup C saw outsiders Colombia, who missed top striker Radamel Falcao due to an injury, take on Greece, Japan and the Ivory Coast. \"Los Cafeteros\" eased through their group with maximum points, defeating Greece 3–0 in Belo Horizonte, the Ivory Coast 2–1 in Brasília and Japan 4–1 in Cuiabá, with James Rodríguez emerging as a rising star after scoring in all three of their matches.\nIn Group D, Uruguay, who ended fourth in South Africa, started off with a shock, as they failed to overcome an offensive second half strategy by minnows Costa Rica and eventually went down 1–3 in Fortaleza, finishing the game with ten men. Uruguay's star player Luis Suárez was unavailable for the opening match due to injury, but returned for Uruguay's second game in São Paulo against England, where immediately became his country's hero as he scored twice to give Uruguay a 2–1 victory. However, in Uruguay's final group game in Natal, Suárez once again was the center of great controversy as he allegedly bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini. Although the referee missed the incident during the match, FIFA subsequently decided to hand Suárez a nine-month ban from all professional football, making him ineligible to compete in the rest of the tournament. Uruguay did still manage to progress to the round of 16, however, as Italian midfielder Claudio Marchisio received a red card and Diego Godín headed home Uruguay's winner in the 81st minute.\nEcuador became the only CONMEBOL nation not to reach the knockout stage. In Group E, \"La Tricolor\" suffered a late 1–2 defeat against Switzerland in Brasília, before beating Honduras by the same scoreline in Curitiba. Their 0–0 draw against France at the Maracanã was not enough to advance. All three Ecuadorian goals at the tournament were scored by striker Enner Valencia.\nArgentina found themselves on enemy soil in Brazil, and struggled to impress in Group F, although they eventually managed to win all three of their group matches narrowly. Star forward Lionel Messi became Argentina's hero in the group phase, scoring four of Argentina's six goals. A 2–1 win over debutants Bosnia and Herzegovina in Rio de Janeiro was followed by a last-gasp 1–0 victory over Iran in Belo Horizonte, with Messi scoring to clinch a victory over the Asian hopefuls. Their group stage campaign ended with a tight 3–2 defeat of African champions Nigeria, with Messi scoring twice, as \"La Albiceleste\" progressed to the knockout phase with nine points out of nine.\nThe Round of 16 featured two all-South American encounters, with hosts Brazil taking on Chile in Belo Horizonte and Colombia facing Uruguay in Rio de Janeiro on the same day.\nThe Brazilians started off very well against Jorge Sampaoli's Chile, with David Luiz scoring an early goal for the hosts. However, Chile soon regained their strength and Alexis Sánchez scored a well-deserved equaliser. The game went into extra time, and both Hulk and Mauricio Pinilla were close to giving their teams the lead, but in the end a penalty shoot-out proved unavoidable. The shoot-out was won 3–2 by Brazil, and the \"Seleção\" went into the quarter-finals at \"La Roja\"'s expense, just as they had in 2010.\nThat night in the Maracanã, Colombia were victorious over Uruguay, as they reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time. James Rodríguez scored twice, once in each half, to bring his tournament tally to five goals and end Uruguayan hopes. Rodríguez's first goal, a chested-down long-range volley, was later elected the goal of the tournament.\nThe other South American team that reached the round of 16, Argentina, played three days later and needed extra time against Switzerland to secure a win in São Paulo, with their only goal being scored by Ángel Di María in the 118th minute.\nIn the quarter-finals, another South American matchup occurred as Brazil met Colombia in Fortaleza. Brazil claimed a 2–0 lead after 70 minutes, with both of their central defenders, captain Thiago Silva and David Luiz, finding the net, and Luiz scoring from a long-range free kick. The lead could not be undone by the Colombians, even though James Rodríguez scored from the penalty spot in the 80th minute. The game didn't end in joy for the Brazilians, though, as top striker Neymar was ruled out for the rest of the tournament with a back injury and captain Thiago Silva was suspended. Rodríguez's strike was his sixth of the tournament, and he eventually finished as the top scorer of the 2014 World Cup.\nArgentina, the only other CONMEBOL representative left, also reached the semi-finals, defeating Belgium 1–0 in Brasília. An early strike from Gonzalo Higuaín was enough for the victory, and Alejandro Sabella's team steered through. A final between rivals Brazil and Argentina didn't seem unlikely.\nHowever, in the semi-finals, things went horribly wrong for the hosts. In a historical encounter against the Germans, Brazil equalled their record worst-ever defeat as they were crushed 1–7 in Belo Horizonte, causing national tragedy and sorrow throughout Brazil. The game is known as the Mineirazo, and is widely remembered as one of the most stunning matches in both World Cup and football history. Felipe Scolari's team suffered the worst-ever defeat in a World Cup semi-final and ended the tournament with a negative goal difference, as Brazil's hopes of lifting the cup on home soil were ended. Germany's Miroslav Klose also overtook Ronaldo's record of fifteen World Cup goals during the match.\nArgentina did manage to reach the final, as they proved themselves the better side in a thrilling penalty shoot-out against the Netherlands in São Paulo. Sergio Romero stopped two penalties and became Argentina's hero after the match had ended in a goalless draw.\nIn the third place play-off in Brasília, Brazil was unable to recover from the shock demolition days earlier, and they lost 0–3 to a rampant Dutch side.\nThe final was played on 13 July in Rio de Janeiro, between Germany and Argentina. Both teams had good chances, and referee Roberto Rosetti was criticized for not sending German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer off, but neither of the teams managed to score a goal. The decision finally fell against Argentina, as German substitute Mario Götze netted home a winner in the 113th minute. This marked the third World Cup in a row that Argentina lost to the Germans, as they fell short again to end as runners-up. Lionel Messi was awarded the Golden Ball for best player of the tournament, a decision that was highly contested. Germany became the first European team to lift the World Cup on South American soil.\n2018: Return of Peru and no South American team in the semi-finals.\nGroup Stage: Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia won the group stage, while France and Denmark beat Peru both by a scoreline of 1-0 to push Peru to third place in the group and therefore not qualifying.\nRound of 16: Uruguay and Brazil beat Portugal and Mexico respectively. Meanwhile, Argentina and Colombia lost against France and England also respectively. This is the first time since 1994 that Argentina did not win in the round of 16.\nQuarters: Uruguay and Brazil lost to France and Belgium respectively. This resulted in no South American teams in the semifinals.\n2022: The third Argentina World Cup title.\nGroup Stage: Argentina and Brazil won, while Ecuador and Uruguay lost against England &amp; Senegal and Portugal &amp; Korea. It was the first time since 2002 that only two South American teams won the group stage.\nRound of 16: Argentina and Brazil beat Australia and Korea\nQuarter-finals: Brazil was eliminated by Croatia, while Argentina won against Netherlands, both matches decided in penalty shoot-outs.\nSemi-finals: Argentina won against Croatia (3x0).\nFinals: in one of the best finals matches in the World Cup history, Argentina won against France in penalty shoot-outs (4x2), after 2x2 and 3x3 in the full time and extra time, respectively."

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles took place at the Long Beach Marine Stadium from 9 to 13 August. There were 5 competitors from 5 nations, with each nation limited to one boat in the event. The event was won by defending champion Bobby Pearce of Australia, the first man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the event and second to win multiple medals overall. Silver went to William Miller of the United States; it was the third consecutive Games in which an American was the runner-up. The United States' podium streak in the event extended to four Games; the nation had won a medal in each of the five times it had appeared. Guillermo Douglas gave Uruguay a bronze medal in its debut in the event. Dick Southwood of Great Britain took fourth place, snapping that nation's five-Games medal streak and marking the first time Great Britain had competed and not won a medal. The only rower not to advance to the final was Canadian Joseph Wright Jr., who finished in fifth place.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nTwo of the 15 rowers from the 1928 Games returned: gold medalist Bobby Pearce of Australia and fifth-place finisher Joseph Wright Jr. of Canada. American William Miller had earned silver in the coxed four in 1928. Pearce, in addition to his Olympic title, had also won the 1930 British Empire Games and the 1931 Diamond Challenge Sculls; he was favored to repeat. A notable absence was Herbert Buhtz of Germany, the 1932 Diamond Challenge winner, who was will and did not compete in this event (but did compete in the double sculls, earning a silver medal).\nUruguay made its debut in the event. Great Britain made its seventh appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat. The competition consists of multiple rounds.\nDuring the first round two semifinal heats were held. The first boat in each heat advanced to the final, while all others were relegated to the repechages.\nThe repechages were rounds which offered rowers a chance to qualify for the final. The first two boats in the repechage heat advanced to the final.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nFirst boat of each heat qualifies to the final, remainder goes to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nFirst two qualify to the final."

All the teams are split between the North and South. Within that geographical split, teams are then split into the Championship (higher division) and the Cup (lower division). The highest placed team in each Cup plays the bottom team in their respective Championship for promotion. As of 2017, the Southern region does not have a Cup division.\nFinally, the winner of the North championship plays the winner of the South championship in the RAN Championship final to decide the winner of the overall tournament.\nChampions.\nChampions by year:"

        "title": "Syracuse Orangemen baseball",
        "text": "The Syracuse Orangemen baseball team was the varsity intercollegiate college baseball team of Syracuse University. The team played its home games at Star Park, the Old Oval, Hendricks Field, Lew Carr Field, and the Archbold Stadium in Syracuse, New York. The Orangemen were affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Syracuse started a club baseball program in the early 2000s, once again bringing the club sport back to campus. The team competes in the North Atlantic West conference of the National Club Baseball Association. Syracuse is one of four universities from the NCAA Division I \"Power 5\" conferences (Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, SEC, and PAC-12) as of 2022 to not sponsor an NCAA baseball team, along with Wisconsin, Iowa State and Colorado.\nHistory.\nSyracuse fielded a varsity intercollegiate baseball team from 1873 through 1921, until the team was disbanded; and then reintroduced in the 1940s. Today the university now fields a team at the Division 2 club level. The current team captured a division title in the 2022-23 season while finishing runner-up in the New England Regional. At the height of the sport's popularity, often more than 1,000 fans attended the games. Syracuse played their home games on Lew Carr Field, named after the Orangemen's coach from 1910 to 1942, compiling a 275–268 record. The program produced 23 MLB players. The field was situated behind Manley Field House, where the lacrosse practice fields are today.\nThe Orangemen appeared in the 1961 College World Series, entering the College World Series with a 16–3 record. In their first game they defeated Northern Colorado 12–5, but were defeated in their next game 12–9 by Oklahoma State. They then defeated Western Michigan 6–0, before being eliminated by eventual tournament runner-up Oklahoma State 8–0. The 1961 Syracuse baseball team included two future major league pitchers, Dave Giusti and Billy Connors, and four members of the 1959 NCAA championship football team: Dave Sarette, Billy Canon, Dick Easterly, and Bob Lelli. Sarette was named as third baseman in the 1961 College World Series all-tournament team.\nDuring the cold winter months, the team practiced in an old barn adjacent to Manley. There was a batting cage made of nets and some artificial mounds for pitchers to throw batting practice, but not much else for players to practice with while in the offseason. There was no way to work on fielding or baserunning, nor could the pitchers realistically throw live pitches to batters. \nSyracuse University played their last game ever against Cortland State College losing 1–0. The game was played at the AAA Syracuse Chiefs field in the spring of 1972 due to poor conditions at their home field.\nThe current Syracuse baseball club now practices in Manley Field House during the winter, and at a small field on Lower Hookway in nice weather."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball single-inning strikeout leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a strikeout occurs when a pitcher throws three strikes to a batter during his time at bat. Under Rules 6.05 and 6.09 of the Official Rules of Major League Baseball, a batter becomes a runner when a third strike is not caught by the catcher with no runner on first base or when there are two outs. The strikeout is recorded, but the batter-runner must be tagged or forced out in order for the defensive team to register the out. Thus, it is possible for a pitcher to record more than three strikeouts in an inning. As a result of this rule, 93 different pitchers have struck out four batters in a half-inning of a Major League Baseball (MLB) game, the most recent being Tyler Glasnow of the Tampa Bay Rays on July 7, 2023. Five players – Chuck Finley, A. J. Burnett, Zack Greinke, Craig Kimbrel, and Tyler Glasnow – have accomplished the feat more than once in their career (Finley is the only one to do it three times, and all three times were within a one-year span); no player has ever struck out more than four batters in an inning. Ed Crane was the first player to strike out four batters in one inning, doing so in the fifth inning for the New York Giants against the Chicago White Stockings on October 4, 1888.\nOut of the 93 pitchers who have accomplished the feat, 71 were right-handed and 22 were left-handed. Three pitchers – Bob Gibson, Walter Johnson and Phil Niekro – are also members of the 3,000 strikeout club. Finley is the only pitcher to achieve the feat on three separate occasions, as well as twice in a single season. Pete Richert struck out four batters in the third inning of his first major league game, becoming the only player to attain the milestone in his debut. Orval Overall is the sole player to strike out four batters in one inning in the World Series.\nOf the players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have struck out four batters in an inning, four have been elected and two were elected on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 major league seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or dead for at least six months.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "The 2013–14 snooker season was a series of snooker tournaments played between 6 June 2013 and 5 May 2014. From this season every qualifying match was held open to the public at various venues in the United Kingdom, replacing the World Snooker Academy in Sheffield. The number of wild-card players at the Chinese ranking events, except the Shanghai Masters, was reduced from eight to four and former Main Tour players were excluded. A professional player could not be selected for more than one wild-card match during the season.\nIn all but three tournaments, every player participated in round one featuring 64 seeds for the first time in the history of snooker. In nine of the ranking tournaments all players took part in the first round, with the winners travelling to the final venue. At three events, the UK Championship, the Welsh Open and the PTC Finals, all matches were held at the final venue. The only three events using the old system were the Australian Goldfields Open, the Shanghai Masters and the World Championship. If a seeded player lost his first-round match in these events, then only half of the prize money counted to his official ranking. This was used in all tournaments following the 2012 World Championship.\nThe season had a total of at least £8 million of prize money. The World Championship, the UK Championship, the International Championship and the Masters were the four biggest tournaments in terms of prize money with the total pot being at least £600,000 at each event. The Indian Open became the first ranking event held in India, and the Champion of Champions was held again after 1980 replacing the Premier League Snooker. At the end of the season Ronnie O'Sullivan was named the \"World Snooker Player of the Year\" and the \"Fans Player of the Year\", Ding Junhui the \"Snooker Writers Player of the Year\" and John Astley the \"Rookie of the Year\". Mark Selby received the \"Performance of the Year\" and \"The Magic Moment of the Year\" awards for winning his first World title and compiling the 100th maximum break in the history of snooker. Dennis Taylor and Cliff Thorburn were inducted into the Hall of Fame.\nNeil Robertson became the first player in the history of snooker to compile one hundred century breaks in a season. Ding Junhui equalled Stephen Hendry's then record of winning five major ranking titles in a season by claiming the Shanghai Masters, the Indian Open, the International Championship, the German Masters and the China Open.\nNew professional players.\nCountries:\nThe 2013/2014 season was made up of 132 professional players. The top 64 players after the 2013 World Championship and the 32 players earning a two-year card the previous year, who hadn't already earned a place, automatically qualified for the 2013/2014 season, as have eight players from the PTC Order of Merit of the Players Tour Championship and four players from the APTC Order of Merit, who have not already qualified for the Main Tour. Another three players came from the EBSA Qualifying Tour Play-Offs, and a further twelve places were available through the 2013 Q School. The rest of the places on to the tour came from amateur events and national governing body nominations.

        "text": "American football has become a popular sport in Brazil since cable television made it possible for people to watch National Football League games. The main organization for American football in Brazil is the American Football Brazilian Confederation.\nSummary.\nHistorically, American football games were played on sand, as to avoid the use of exported equipment from the United States of America and to reduce the impact of the tackles. The 2010s have seen most Brazilian states develop American football teams of various types; including flag football, tackle American football and women's football. A Brazilian Portuguese forum regarding American football was founded in 1998 in order to get more people watching the games on ESPN. As of 2013, there are 2500 Brazilian people who play American football. The first organized American football game between two Brazilian teams took place in 2008 when the Curitiba Brown Spiders took on the Barigui Crocodiles.\n100 coaches from American high school and adult amateur teams have been sent to Brazil to teach aspiring coaches about the basics of American football.\nMedia attention traditionally given to Brazil on association football have been increased towards American football. Very little sponsorship money is given; as most money is tied into association football. Victor Menossi Rodrigues is one of the founders of the Brazilian \"form\" of American football after experimenting with boxing and judo. A significant number of female spectators are attracted to American football in Brazil; even to the point where they go to parties where the American football players pretend to speak English. Children between the ages of 8 and 13 are being encouraged by educational organizations to start participating in American football.\nOther traditional fixtures in the Brazilian sports lifestyle like volleyball and Formula One are slowly losing their fanbase to American football. Once the game transitioned from sand to grass, the popularity of American football jumped. Players are only asked to practice occasionally and women have been embraced into even the \"full contact\" leagues. Copacabana Beach is considered to be the birthplace of American football in Brazil; where 20 men played the first game of American football in Brazilian history. All American football games not done on the beach are played out in public parks and teams must pay up to $300 to the municipality as rent. All Brazil had for equipment in 1989 was mouthguards from boxing rings and imported American footballs."

He previously served as the secondary coach for the Houston Texans and has coached collegiately at several schools, including Penn State, South Carolina, and Minnesota.\nCoaching career.\nCollege.\nButler began his coaching career as an assistant at his alma mater, Catholic University, as a defensive backs coach before being promoted to defensive coordinator in 1996. He then progressed to Texas, where he served as a graduate assistant under both John Mackovic and Mack Brown in 1997 and 1998 respectively. After spending the next four years in the lower levels of college football, he returned to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in 2003 with Harvard, where he worked as the linebackers coach and special teams coach. His first connection to Ted Roof came from 2007 to 2010 while working for the Minnesota Golden Gophers as the linebackers coach under Roof. The Houston Texans hired Butler as a defensive assistant in the off-season, but then was hired by South Carolina where he served for one year. Butler re-united with Roof on Bill O'Brien's staff at Penn State. After Roof moved back to his alma mater at Georgia Tech, Butler was promoted to defensive coordinator over two more experienced assistants, linebackers coach Ron Vanderlinden and defensive line coach Larry Johnson. \nProfessional.\nIn early 2014, Butler left Penn State to join O'Brien's Houston Texans staff as secondary coach. On January 2, 2018 he was fired by the Houston Texans. On January 30, 2018 Butler was hired by the Buffalo Bills coaching staff under head coach and former high school teammate Sean McDermott.

        "title": "2014 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2014 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game that was played on January 1, 2014, at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California. This 100th Rose Bowl Game matched Big Ten Conference Champions Michigan State Spartans against Pac-12 Conference champions Stanford Cardinal (the defending Rose Bowl champions). It was one of the 2013–14 bowl games that concluded the 2013 FBS football season. The first game in the final edition of the Bowl Championship Series, it was sponsored by the Vizio consumer electronics company, and officially titled the Rose Bowl Game presented by Vizio.\nIn a game dominated by both teams' rushing offense and strong defense, Michigan State defeated Stanford by a score of 24–20. It was only the Big Ten's second Rose Bowl victory since 2000.\nThe contest was televised on ESPN with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which began at 1:30 PM (PST) with kickoff at 2:10 PM (PST). The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association was the organizer of the game.\nThe Rose Bowl Game, themed \"Dreams Come True\", was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public. Tickets had a face value of $185 each, with end zone tickets selling at $150.\nPre-game activities.\nThe game was presided over by the 2014 Rose Queen Ana Marie Acosta, the Royal Court, Tournament of Roses President Scott Jenkins, and Grand Marshal Vin Scully.\nAfter the teams' arrival in Southern California, the teams participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day at Disneyland in nearby Anaheim. The Rose Bowl Hall of Fame ceremony luncheon was held prior to the game at the Pasadena Convention Center, where Lloyd Carr, Orlando Pace, and Lynn Swann were inducted into the hall.\nThe bands and cheerleaders from both schools participated in the pre-game Rose Parade on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California along with the floats. Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill and Darlene Love kicked off the pre-game festivities.\nTeams.\nTeams playing in the Rose Bowl game are usually the winners of the Pac-12 and Big Ten conference championship games, unless one team (or both teams) play in the BCS National Championship game. The teams were officially selected by the football committee of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association on Selection Sunday on December 8, 2013.\nOn December 7, 2013, the Stanford Cardinal defeated Pac-12 South Division Champion Arizona State Sun Devils 38–14 for the Pac-12 Conference Championship, clinching their second straight Rose Bowl berth; The Cardinal won the Rose Bowl Game the previous season. Later that night, the Michigan State Spartans defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes in the 2013 Big Ten Football Championship Game 34–24 to become the Big Ten Conference Champions and were given a berth in the Rose Bowl game, their first since 1988.\nThe teams had met five times before, including the 1996 Sun Bowl won by Stanford 38–0. Michigan State led the series 3–2. Before the game, the teams held their pre-game practices at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. As the designated home team for the game, Michigan State wore its green home jerseys while Stanford wore its white away jerseys.\nMichigan State.\nThis was the 5th time Michigan State had played in the Rose Bowl game, where they are the winningest team from the Big Ten by win percentage, holding a 4–1 record; by contrast, the Big Ten as whole was 1–9 in the last 10 Rose Bowls. November has been good for the Spartans, winning 11 of the last 13 games (3–0 in 2010; 4–0 in 2011; 1–2 in 2012, 3–0 in 2013). The Spartans, led by seventh year coach Mark Dantonio, led the conference in scoring defense (16 touchdowns allowed), rushing defense (64.8 yards per game), total defense (237.7 yards per game) and pass defense (172.9 yard per game) during the regular season. Defensive end Shilique Calhoun finished second in the Big Ten Conference in sacks (7.5) and finished first in fumbles forced (4) and recovered (4). He was an Associated Press second-team All-American. Cornerback Darqueze Dennard was named a consensus first-team All-American and earned the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. Offensively, the team was led by Jeremy Langford in rushing (269 carries for 1,338 yards, 4.97 avg., 17 TDs), Connor Cook in passing (201 of 344 for 2,423 yards, 20 TDs, 5 INTs), and Bennie Fowler in receiving (34 catches for 525 yards, 15.44 avg., 6 TDs).\nStanford.\nThe Stanford Cardinal, who played in the first Rose Bowl in 1902, came back to the Rose Bowl for the second time in a row. For the fourth season in a row, the Cardinal had won 11 or more games. Led by LB Trent Murphy and LB Shayne Skov, the defense has allowed just 91.62 yards rushing (No. 3 in the FBS) and is averaging 3.08 sacks (tied for No. 1 in FBS). Offensively, Stanford was led by RB Tyler Gaffney, who gained 1,626 yards this season for 20 touchdowns; and WR Ty Montgomery, who has gained 161.0 all-purpose yards per game and scored 12 touchdowns. In the 24–10 win over UCLA, Gaffney carried 26 times for 171 yards; in the 26–20 win on Oregon, he carried 45 times for 157 yards; and in the Notre Dame game, he carried for 189 yards in 33 carries to defeat the Fighting Irish, 27–20.\nGame summary.\nFirst quarter.\nStanford received the opening kickoff and on the second play from scrimmage, Kevin Hogan went deep and found Michael Rector for 43 yards, putting them immediately in Michigan State territory. Several plays later, Tyler Gaffney scored on a 16-yard run after a missed tackle by MSU safety Isaiah Lewis. Stanford took a 7–0 lead early in the first quarter. The Michigan State offense, led by Connor Cook, would be able to get into Stanford territory on their first 2 drives, but were unable to score on both attempts. Stanford would be able to add 3 points to its score near the end of the 1st quarter after a 47-yard run by Tyler Gaffney put them in field goal position. As the first quarter came to an end, Stanford held a 10–0 lead.\nSecond quarter.\nMichigan State had the ball to begin the second quarter. The Spartans moved the ball with efficiency and controlled the pace as a Tony Lippett reception of 24 yards put MSU in Stanford territory. The Michigan State offense appeared to have stalled at the Stanford 9 yard line, however, a pass interference penalty called on 3rd and goal against the Cardinal gave the Spartans a new set of downs. Jeremy Langford was then able to score on a 2-yard run, putting the score at 10–7. The remainder of the second quarter became a battle of field position, with both defenses setting the tone. With under 3 minutes left in the first half, Michigan State had good field position at their own 41 yard line after Stanford was forced to punt from their own endzone. On the second play of the possession, Connor Cook, while being hit, threw an ill-advised pass up for grabs and Stanford linebacker Kevin Anderson intercepted it, returning it 40 yards on a pick-six, expanding the Cardinal lead to 17–7.\nWith 2:07 remaining, the MSU offense took the field, fresh off a costly turnover. On 2nd and 10, a Connor Cook completion to Tony Lippett for 24 yards got them to mid-field. Another 2nd and 10 completion to Jeremy Langford went for 11 yards and put Michigan State in Stanford territory. One play later, Connor Cook saw man coverage and completed a 37-yard strike to 5th year senior Bennie Fowler, who made a challenging catch to put Michigan State at the Stanford 3 yard line. Several plays later, Cook, scrambling away from pressure, found fullback Trevon Pendleton for a touchdown, pulling the Spartans within 3. After receiving the kickoff, Stanford chose to run out the clock, maintaining a 17–14 halftime lead.\nThird quarter.\nMichigan State would receive the second half kickoff and was able to tie the game on a Michael Geiger 31 yard field goal after a Bennie Fowler catch and run of 60 yards on the second play of the half put MSU in field goal position. With the game tied 17–17, Stanford received the ball. After an 11-yard completion to Ryan Hewitt, in a fashion similar to how the game started, Kevin Hogan went deep to Michael Rector again on 1st and 10, however, this time the ball was intercepted as Michigan State cornerback Trae Waynes took the ball away from Rector while the both of them were falling to the ground. On the ensuing Michigan State possession, the Cardinal defense stood tall, forcing a punt and giving their offense a second chance. Backed up at their own 7 yard line, the Stanford offense did not start off their drive as planned, as a botched handoff between Kevin Hogan and Tyler Gaffney almost resulted in what would have been a disastrous turnover. On 2nd down, Gaffney was tackled for a 1-yard loss. On 3rd and 11 with the ball at the Stanford 6 yard line, Kevin Hogan threw deep over the middle to tight end Devon Cajuste, which was caught for a 51-yard gain and put Stanford in Michigan State territory. A holding penalty called against Stanford (only the 3rd holding penalty called against the Cardinal offensive line all season) the next play made it 1st and 20. On 3rd and 17, Kevin Hogan took off on a 14-yard scramble to make a 4th down conversion seem manageable. On 4th and 3, Stanford turned the ball over on downs after Tyler Gaffney was tackled in the backfield for a 3-yard loss by senior Spartan linebacker Denicos Allen.\nTrying to take advantage of the failed 4th down conversion, the Michigan State running game, which had been rather quiet for the majority of the game (Spartan running back Jeremy Langford had rushed for over 100 yards in 8 consecutive games before this game), started to gain momentum. Jeremy Langford ripped off 4 straight rushes for a combined 34 yards. Connor Cook then completed 2 passes for 15 yards and it was clear that the Michigan State offense had found a rhythm. However, while fighting for extra yardage on the next play, Langford was stripped of the football by Cardinal linebacker Shayne Skov, and Stanford recovered the ball at their own 8 yard line. After a quick possession, Stanford would have to punt the ball to begin the 4th quarter with the game tied 17–17.\nFourth quarter.\nA poor Stanford punt from their own 7 yard line and a 19-yard return from Macgarrett Kings gave Michigan State advantageous field position at the Cardinal 27 yard line. A rush for negative yardage and a false start penalty backed MSU up to the Stanford 34 yard line. On 2nd and 17, Connor Cook completed a 9-yard pass to tight end Josiah Price, making it 3rd and 8. Taking the shotgun snap, Connor Cook hit Tony Lippett over the middle for a 25-yard touchdown pass, giving Michigan State their first lead, 24–17. Stanford was unable to pick up a first down on their next possession and were forced to punt. The Michigan State offense did no better, after the offensive line allowed a sack on 3rd and long. After a 38-yard punt, Stanford got the ball back at their own 28 yard line, trailing by a touchdown.\nOn the first play of the possession, Michael Rector received the ball on an end-around and gained 27 yards, putting the Cardinal in Spartan territory at the MSU 45. A holding penalty called against All-American and Thorpe Award recipient Darqueze Dennard gave Stanford 10 free yards and put them in field goal position. On the field goal attempt, the hold was botched and chaos ensued, as the holder attempted to pick up the first down in a last-ditch effort by running, but then decided to throw for it as pressure was coming his way. He threw the ball up and linebacker Trent Murphy caught the ball for a first down. However, an ineligible receiver downfield penalty was called against Stanford and they had to attempt another field goal instead, this time from 39 yards away, which was good. Michigan State would receive the ball with a 24–20 lead with a little over 4 minutes remaining in the game. They were only able to take 1:09 off the clock and were forced to punt the ball back to Stanford.\nWith 3:06 remaining in the game, Stanford had the ball at their own 25 yard line. They ran the ball 3 straight times for 9 yards, with Kevin Hogan, Ricky Seale, and Tyler Gaffney as the respective ball carriers. With 1:46 remaining, Stanford head coach David Shaw took a timeout, knowing that he would have to go for it on 4th and 1 if Stanford were to have an opportunity to take the lead. After seeing what Stanford had lined up with, Michigan State head coach Mark Dantonio took a timeout of his own to assess the situation. It was a 4th and 1, short yardage situation at the Stanford 34 yard line. Kevin Hogan took the snap and handed it to the up-back Ryan Hewitt who was stopped for no gain as Spartan linebackers Kyler Elsworth and Darien Harris jumped over the middle of a mass pile of lineman to make the tackle. Elsworth, a former walk-on, was 2-time team captain Max Bullough's replacement. Stanford turned over the ball on downs for the second time and Michigan State ran out the clock from there, and with the victory secured their first 13 win season in school history and their first Rose Bowl win since 1988. Elsworth was named Defensive Player of the Game, and Connor Cook was named Offensive Player of the Game."

        "text": "John Gerald \"Gable\" Shackelford (July 17, 1905 – June 27, 1964), was a Negro league baseball player, manager, executive, and attorney. He lived much of his early life in Prescott, Arkansas, and in Hot Springs, Arkansas.\nBiography.\nShackelford's birth date is often listed as April 9, 1894. However, this is false. Rather, Shackelford was born in 1905 in Tennessee, the son of John D. Shackelford and Lula May Oliver.\nHe grew up in Prescott, Arkansas, where his father worked as a high school principal and a lawyer. His mother died when he was only four, but his father remarried the next year. Later, when Shackelford was a young adult, he and his family moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas.\nDuring the mid-1920s, Shackelford attended Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, serving as president of the Alpha Sigma fraternity. As a student, he advocated for literacy among blacks and participated on the school's baseball and basketball teams. He was particularly good at baseball and was selected as the best third baseman in the Southern Athletic Association in 1923. In fact, Shackelford was talented enough play professionally during the summers between semesters with several Negro league baseball teams, including the Cleveland Browns in 1924, the Harrisburg Giants in 1925, and the Chicago American Giants in 1926. Shackelford played with the Birmingham Black Barons in 1930.\nAfter graduating from Wiley, Shackelford moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and studied at the University of Michigan Law School to become an attorney like his father. He graduated in 1931 and set up a law practice in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Meanwhile, he both managed and played for various semi-professional Negro teams in nearby Lowell, Michigan, including the Fineis Gas Colored Giants from 1931-1932, the Dixie Gas Stars from 1933-1934, and the Chicky Bar Giants in 1935.\nBy 1940, Shackelford moved his law practice to Cleveland, Ohio. While there, he became involved in Negro league baseball administration. He was nominated for president of the Negro American League in 1944, but lost the election to J. B. Martin. The following spring, Shackelford became involved in the foundation of the upstart United States League and was elected president of the organization. The league operated from 1945-1946, but competition from already existing Negro leagues, as well as difficulties associated with wartime economics, ultimately caused it to fail. In addition to serving as president for both seasons the league operated, Shackelford managed the league's Cleveland Clippers in 1946.\nShackelford continued to practice law in Cleveland for many years, eventually moving to Los Angeles.\nDeath.\nAt some point in his later life, he traveled to Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. Ill with tuberculosis, Shackelford died there on June 27, 1964. He was buried in Panteon Colonias Cemetery in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

        "title": "Showtime (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, Showtime was an era in Los Angeles Lakers history from 1979 to 1991 when the National Basketball Association (NBA) team played an exciting run-and-gun style of basketball. Led by Magic Johnson's passing skills and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring, the team relied on fast breaks and won five NBA championships. Lakers owner Jerry Buss purchased the team in 1979, and he wanted their games to be entertaining. He insisted that the Lakers play an up-tempo style, and the team hired dancers and a live band for their home games at The Forum. The team established a Hollywood-celebrity following.\nBackground.\nIn 1979, former Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was in the process of selling the team to Jerry Buss. Possessing the first overall pick in the upcoming 1979 NBA draft, the Lakers narrowed their choice to either Magic Johnson or Sidney Moncrief. Los Angeles already had a fine point guard in Norm Nixon, making Moncrief potentially a wonderful complement at off guard. However, Cooke liked Johnson's smile and playing style. In one of Cooke's last acts as Lakers owner, the Lakers drafted the point guard Johnson.\nBuss wanted Lakers games to be entertaining. In the 1960s, he was a regular at The Horn, a nightclub in Santa Monica, California, that attracted an upscale clientele. Buss loved the excitement of the club's famous opening act, which included a dimming of the lights followed by a dramatic singing of their signature tune, \"It's Showtime\". After he purchased the Lakers and The Forum from Cooke, Buss embarked on creating a grand-scale version of The Horn. Like a night club act, he believed a basketball game should be entertaining.\nBuss sought to match the excitement of college basketball games between the USC Trojans and the UCLA Bruins during John Wooden's era. The owner insisted the Lakers have a running game. After Jerry West had retired as Lakers head coach, and the team failed to recruit Jerry Tarkanian of the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, Buss hired Jack McKinney to install a running offense.\nIn Buss' opinion, a theatrical atmosphere paired with the running game would excite the fans and strengthen the Lakers' home-court advantage. He wanted to create a Hollywood atmosphere that would be embraced by the Los Angeles culture even if it was hated by the rest of the country. Buss borrowed the term \"Showtime\" from The Horn to describe the Lakers' approach to basketball, and it was embraced by Lakers fans and the Los Angeles media.\nBasketball.\nBuss was not afraid to spend money on players. In 1981, Abdul-Jabbar was the highest-paid player in the NBA at $870,000 a season, when Buss signed Johnson to a 25-year, $25 million contract.\nOffensive style.\nThe most important component of Showtime was the Lakers' fast break. In a typical sequence, rebounders such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kurt Rambis, and A.C. Green would quickly release an outlet pass to Johnson, who would race down the court and distribute the ball to players such as Jamaal Wilkes, James Worthy, Byron Scott, and Michael Cooper for a finishing layup or slam dunk. Oftentimes, Johnson would rebound the ball and drive the ball up court himself on a fast break. He would sometimes deliver the ball to teammates with a no-look pass.\nIf the break was not there, the Lakers would settle into their half-court offense and rely on Abdul-Jabbar—the NBA's second all-time leading scorer—and his unique signature skyhook. Backing him up at center were Bob McAdoo, a former NBA Most Valuable Player, and in later years, Mychal Thompson, a former No. 1 overall draft pick; both were ostensibly power forwards who could change the game's pace with their quickness and outside shooting ability. As Abdul-Jabbar neared the age of 40, Riley had Johnson assume scoring responsibilities. Johnson's \"junior, junior skyhook\" won Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals.\nShowtime era.\nMcKinney coached the Lakers for only 13 games before he was involved in a serious bike accident during the 1979–80 season. The Lakers replaced him with assistant Paul Westhead, who led the Lakers that season to their first championship in almost a decade. Westhead used McKinney's offense, a creative and spontaneous offense that defined Showtime. However, he started altering the offense the following season. The team started the 1981–82 season at 7–4, but six of those wins were by four points or fewer, and the media criticized Westhead's more-structured offense. Although they had won five in a row, Buss was also disenchanted with the offense and then Johnson, frustrated with Westhead and his system, asked to be traded. Instead, Westhead was fired and replaced by Pat Riley. The Lakers' up-tempo style was restored under Riley, and they won another championship that season.\nRiley led the Lakers to four championships. Dressed in sleek Italian suits with his hair slicked back with mousse, he added to the team's Hollywood image. Riley was also innovative on defense; he was one of the first coaches to employ a 1-3-1 half-court trap to pick up the pace of the game. Though the Showtime Lakers were known for their offense, they won championships with their defense. In Cooper, they had one of the top defensive stoppers in the game. The league-wide perception was that the Lakers played with finesse and were not physical enough to win in the playoffs. Riley's mantra was \"no rebounds, no [championship] rings\".\nThe Lakers in 1985 won their first championship in nine meetings against the Boston Celtics and again defeated their rivals for the title in 1987. At the championship celebrations following the 1987 Finals, Riley boldly guaranteed before the cheering crowd that the Lakers would win it all again in 1988. This was a very bold gesture as the league had not had a repeat champion for nearly 20 years. Nevertheless, this guarantee was fulfilled as the Lakers repeated as champions in 1988, becoming the first NBA team to capture back-to-back championships since the Celtics' repeat title in 1968–69 in center Bill Russell's last season. With the team older, the Lakers were more of a half-court team that season.\nAlthough Abdul-Jabbar retired in 1989 and Riley stepped down the year after, most believe the Showtime era ended in 1991 when the Lakers lost the finals to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls and Johnson retired after finding out he was HIV-positive. By Johnson's last season, he had grown more powerful and stronger than in his earlier years, but the league's third-oldest point guard was also slower and less nimble. Mike Dunleavy was the new head coach, the offense used more half-court sets, and the team had a renewed emphasis on defense. \"The Prescott Courier\" called those Lakers \"Slow-time\".\nSeason-by-season record.\nOverall, the Showtime Lakers played 984 regular season games, totaling 712 wins and 272 losses, resulting in a win percentage of 72.4%.\nKey players.\nThe following is a list of the key players of the Showtime era (1979–91).\nHome crowd.\nThe Lakers played their home games at The Forum, which billed itself as \"the modern version of the greater Colosseum of ancient Rome\". The Forum was a circle with an oval interior supported by 80 white concrete columns. After he became owner, Buss hired a public address announcer with a livelier voice, Lawrence Tanter. He also transformed the Forum Club, previously a family-friendly restaurant and lounge inside the Forum, into the hottest nightclub in Los Angeles.\nBuss lured Hollywood celebrities and the rich and famous to the game to add more excitement in the crowd. Not only did Buss want stars on his team, he also wanted stars watching them. At the height of Showtime, some celebrities that contacted the team could not even buy tickets. ESPN wrote that The Forum grew to be \"as synonymous with movie stars\" as the Hollywood Sign. During national telecasts, the network would regularly show the courtside celebrities. Actor Jack Nicholson, considered the Lakers' most well-known celebrity fan, was often seen sitting courtside in his shades. \"The Washington Post\" quipped that \"The Forum may be the only place where the fans make more money than the players.\"\nA fan of the college game, Buss wanted the Lakers to have live music and cheerleaders. He replaced the arena's organist with a 10-piece band of musicians from the University of Southern California (USC).\nCheerleaders were not common in the NBA at the time, but Buss ordered the formation of the Laker Girls, a talented and sexy team of female dancers. Rex the Peanut Man, a peanut vendor, would dance to entertain the crowd. The Lakers later employed Dancing Barry, a Showtime staple who added to the party atmosphere by dancing in the aisles during timeouts wearing sunglasses and a tuxedo.\nThe \"Hartford Courant\" wrote, \"You go to The Fabulous Forum, and you get a basketball game in between lounge acts.\" \"The News and Courier\" added, \"Only one thing beats the thrill of victory. Victory with pizzaz.\" NBA commissioner David Stern said Showtime showed that \"an arena can become the focal point for not just basketball, but entertainment.\"\nAftermath.\nThe Lakers did not win another championship until 2000, which began a streak of three consecutive titles led by stars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. However, the team's style under coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense was not as exciting or graceful, generally grinding down opponents behind O'Neal's strength. Rudy Tomjanovich was hired in 2004 to install an up-tempo offense and revive the high-scoring of the 1980s teams. He was not successful, and the Lakers reverted to the triangle offense as Jackson returned. Under Jackson's guidance, the Lakers were NBA champions again in 2009 and 2010.\nThe Phoenix Suns with point guard Steve Nash were a running team under Mike D'Antoni, and \"The New York Times\" called them \"this decade’s incarnation of the Los Angeles Lakers’ Showtime\". When D'Antoni joined with the Lakers and Nash in 2012, he declared, \"We would love to be able to play 'Showtime' basketball.\" With slower personnel than he had in Phoenix, D'Antoni eventually abandoned his up-tempo offense. That season, however, Magic Johnson compared the Los Angeles Clippers, the Lakers' crosstown rivals, to Showtime. \"I thought I would never, ever see Showtime again. And I was the architect of Showtime. The Clippers? That's Showtime,\" he said."

        "text": "Gary Kirsten is a former international cricketer who represented South Africa between 1993 and 2004. A left-handed batsman who primarily played as an opener, Kirsten took part in 101 Test matches and 185 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for his country and scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 21 and 13 occasions respectively.\nKirsten made both his Test and ODI debuts against Australia in December 1993. He made his first Test century in November 1995, when he scored 110 against England. A year later Kirsten made centuries in both innings of a Test when he scored 102 and 133 in the second Test of the 1996–97 series against India. He achieved his highest Test score in 1999, when he made 275 against England in Durban. In an attempt to prevent South Africa from losing the match, he batted for almost 14 hours, spread across the last three of the match's five days. The innings remains the second-longest by any batsman in Test cricket in terms of time span, behind an innings of over 16 hours recorded by Hanif Mohammad for Pakistan in 1958. His most prolific series was against England in 2003, when he made 462 runs at an average of 66.00 including two centuries. His accomplishments with the bat during the season led to him being named as one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year the following year. As of June 2015, Kirsten is joint fourth in the list of leading Test century-makers for South Africa with AB de Villiers, and his total of three double centuries for the team is exceeded only by the four recorded by Graeme Smith. He scored centuries against all nine other teams which held Test match status at the time, and was the first player to score a hundred against every other active Test-playing nation.\nKirsten's first ODI century came against Australia in January 1994 in the first match of the best-of-three final of the Tri-nation tournament. His highest score in ODI cricket came against the United Arab Emirates during the 1996 Cricket World Cup when he scored 188 not out. As of November 2016, this is the highest one-day figure recorded by a South African and the third-highest in the World Cup by any batsman. In ODIs he was most successful against India, accumulating four centuries. South Africa lost only one of the thirteen matches in which Kirsten scored a century. As of November 2016, he is thirtieth among all-time century makers, and sixth in the equivalent list for South Africa."

        "text": "The 2013 Clemson Tigers baseball team was the varsity intercollegiate baseball team representing Clemson University in the 2013 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Tigers competed in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and were led by twentieth-year head coach Jack Leggett. Clemson played its home games at Doug Kingsmore Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina.\nSeason.\nPreseason.\nClemson announced its 2013 baseball schedule in November 2012. Clemson's non-conference schedule included two series against SEC teams– a three-game weekend rivalry series against South Carolina and a two-game midweek series against Georgia. Also in non-conference play, it included weekend series against William &amp; Mary, Wright State, and Georgia Southern, along with midweek games against other mid-major programs. In ACC play, it included home series against Virginia, Duke, Wake Forest, Georgia Tech, and Maryland, and road series against NC State, North Carolina, Boston College, Miami (FL), and Florida State.\nAfter having many players from the 2012 team turn professional, graduate, or transfer, 19 first-year players joined Clemson for the 2013 season. Clemson's recruiting class was ranked fifth in Division I baseball and first in the ACC. It included 16 high school players, two junior college transfers, and one Division I transfer. Three players in the recruiting class– Tyler Krieger, Kevin Bradley, and Clate Schmidt– were selected in the 2012 Major League Baseball draft but chose to attend college.\nTwo Clemson players received individual accolades prior to the start of the season. Junior infielder Steve Wilkerson was named to both the \"Collegiate Baseball\" Preseason All-America Third Team and the \"College Baseball Insider\" Preseason All-America Honorable Mention Team. Senior pitcher Scott Firth was named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) Stopper of the Year Award Watchlist.\nFirth, senior outfielder Thomas Brittle, junior first baseman Jon McGibbon, and senior bullpen catcher Marcus Curry were named Clemson's captains for the season.\nAt the January American Baseball Coaches Association Convention and throughout the season, head coach Jack Leggett received media attention for his support of proposals to adopt a new baseball for NCAA play. Such a baseball would be modeled after the ball used in minor league baseball; it would have flat seams and a harder core that would allow it to travel farther off the bat. Leggett and other head coaches supported the new baseball in response to the drop in offense following the adoption of BBCOR bats in the 2011 season.\nIn the preseason ACC coaches' poll, released in late January, Clemson was picked to finish third in the six-team Atlantic Division. The team received one first-place vote. NC State was picked to finish first in the Atlantic Division and to win the ACC. The Tigers began the preseason on the fringe of the national rankings, #27 in the \"Collegiate Baseball\" poll, #28 in the NCBWA poll, and unranked in the Coaches' Poll and the \"Baseball America\" poll.\nIn early February, the team's regular season television schedule was announced. Ten games were planned to be televised on one of ESPNU, CSS, and RSN. 35 additional games were planned to be webcast on ESPN 3 or Clemson's athletic website.\nFebruary.\nClemson's opening weekend rotation consisted of sophomore Daniel Gossett, sophomore Patrick Andrews, and senior Scott Firth. Its opening day lineup was as follows: senior center fielder Thomas Brittle, sophomore left fielder Tyler Slaton, junior second baseman Steve Wilkerson, junior designated hitter Shane Kennedy, junior first baseman Jon McGibbon, sophomore third baseman Jay Baum, freshman right fielder Steve Duggar, freshman shortstop Tyler Krieger, and sophomore catcher Garrett Boulware.\nOn opening weekend, Clemson won two of three games at home against William &amp; Mary. In Friday's opening day game on February 15, Clemson won, 2–0, as a result of Kennedy's two-run home run in the bottom of the eighth. On Saturday, Clemson lost, 11–2, when starter Andrews gave up four earned runs in three innings. Relievers Matthew Crownover, Mike Kent, and Brody Koerner each gave up multiple runs, as well. Clemson won the series with a 12–2 win on Sunday. The Tigers scored all 12 runs after the fifth inning, and Firth was credited with a win in his first start since 2011.\nIn the second weekend of the season, Clemson swept a three-game home series against Wright State. After the series's Friday game was postponed due to rain, Clemson swept a Saturday doubleheader, 5–3 and 6–0. In the first game, Wilkerson homered and Matt Campbell was credited with his second save of the season. In the second, Clate Schmidt, who had replaced Andrews in the rotation, threw four scoreless innings. On Sunday, in the series's final game, Firth pitched eight scoreless innings, and Clemson won, 7–0. With the 6–0 and 7–0 wins, Clemson recorded back-to-back shutouts for the first time since shutting out Presbyterian and USC Upstate on consecutive days in 2009.\nClemson's final game of the month came against Winthrop on February 27. Crownover started the game to become Clemson's first left-handed starting pitcher in 101 games. Winthrop won the game, 3–2 in 11 innings, scoring the go-ahead run on a Clay Altman sacrifice fly in the top of the 11th. The Tigers finished the month with a 5–2 record.\nMarch.\nClemson's first three games of March were a rivalry series against #7 South Carolina. Entering the series, Clemson held a 169–129–2 lead in the all-time series. South Carolina entered with an 18–7 record in the previous five seasons. In 2012, \"Baseball America\" writer Aaron Fitt called the two teams' rivalry \"far and away the most compelling rivalry college baseball has to offer.\" In addition to Clate Schmidt's joining the weekend rotation, the lineup changed slightly, with freshman outfielder Maleeke Gibson appearing in more games in left field than sophomore Tyler Slaton.\nIn game one at Clemson home field Doug Kingsmore Stadium on Friday, March 1, South Carolina won, 6–0. South Carolina starting pitcher Jordan Montgomery pitched eight scoreless innings. Clemson had only three hits and committed three errors, including a dropped fly ball by Shane Kennedy in South Carolina's three-run seventh inning. Five of the six runs the Tigers' pitching staff allowed were unearned. The game one attendance of 6,016 spectators was Clemson's highest home attendance mark to that point in the season. Game two was played at a neutral site, Greenville, South Carolina's Fluor Field; Clemson won, 6–3, to break a three-game losing streak against South Carolina. Schmidt, in his second start, gave up two runs in seven innings to earn his second win, and Matt Campbell got his third save. Duggar had two hits and two RBI. Clemson lost the series with an 8–0 loss in Sunday's game three, played at Carolina Stadium. Similarly to Friday's loss, Clemson's offense had only three hits, and five of the six runs given up by starter Scott Firth were unearned. South Carolina starter Nolan Belcher pitched a complete game shutout. A total of 21,383 spectators attended the series's three games. In the week three polls conducted following the series, Clemson was not ranked by any of the four national polls.\nThrough ten games, several young pitchers performed well for the team. Neither sophomore transfer Kyle Schnell (in 6.0 innings) nor freshman Zack Erwin (in 2.1 innings) gave up a run. Freshman Matthew Crownover gave up one in his only appearance. Crownover started a midweek game on March 6, in which Clemson defeated Wofford, 9–2. Duggar had four RBI in the game, and Kennedy had three.\nIn the season's fourth weekend, the team started Atlantic Coast Conference play with a three-game series at #8 NC State. Clemson won the series, two games to one. In game one, Clemson won, 10–5, against left-handed pitcher Carlos Rodon (named 2012 National Freshman of the Year by \"Baseball America\"), despite having struggled against left-handed pitching early in the season. Sophomore catcher Garrett Boulware hit two home runs in the game, while batting sixth in the lineup. Boulware had begun the season batting ninth, but because of strong performances was moved to the cleanup spot by the end of the series. In game two, Clemson won the series with a 7–4 win. Thomas Brittle second-inning grand slam gave Clemson an early lead. Starter Schmidt pitched only 3.2 innings, and senior right-hander Jonathan Meyer gave up two runs in relief. Schnell, after pitching 2.1 innings on Friday, threw 2.2 scoreless innings in the sixth, seventh, and eighth to set up Campbell's fourth save. Clemson lost game three, 4–1. Clemson's offense had ten hits, but left ten runners on base, and Firth took his second loss after giving up two runs (one earned) in 6.2 innings. After not being ranked following the South Carolina series, Clemson was ranked #26 by \"Collegiate Baseball\" following the series win over NC State. Through the end of the NC State series, Clemson's starting pitching had been strong– each of the team's three weekend starters (Gossett, Schmidt, and Firth) had an earned run average of less than 2.00.\nClemson won a March 13 midweek game against Charleston Southern, 3–1, to make Clemson's all-time record against the Buccaneers 17–0. Crownover pitched 6.0 scoreless innings to earn the win, and Schnell pitched 1.1 scoreless innings to earn his first save.\nThe team played its first home conference series from March 15–17 against #12 Virginia; Clemson lost the series, two games to one. Tyler Slaton returned to the starting lineup for two of the three games against Virginia, and he started and batted leadoff for much of the rest of the season. In game one, Clemson held a 5–2 lead entering the ninth inning, in part because of a three-RBI game by Kennedy. Daniel Gossett gave up only two runs in 7.0+ innings. However, Virginia tied the game with three runs in the ninth off of Campbell and Schnell, then took the lead and eventually won, 6–5, on a Mike Papi home run in the top of the eleventh. Clemson won game two, 7–6. Although Schmidt gave up five runs in four innings, Zack Erwin pitched five innings of one-hit, one-run relief to earn his first win. Boulware, who had a triple, home run, and three RBI, scored Thomas Brittle with a walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth. On Sunday, Virginia won the series with an 8–5 win. Firth gave up six runs in five innings to take his third loss of the season.\nOn March 19 and 20, Clemson swept Morehead State in a non-conference two-game series. The Tigers won the first game, 10–5; Boulware hit his fourth home run and had four RBI, and Mike Kent threw three scoreless innings of relief to get his first win. In game two, Clemson won, 5–2; first baseman Jon McGibbon had three RBI, and senior reliever Jonathan Meyer pitched four scoreless innings to earn his first win.\nIn the team's third conference series, it won two of three games at home against Duke. In game one, Gossett pitched a complete game shutout, and Clemson won, 7–0, scoring in each of the last five innings. The two teams then played a Saturday doubleheader, due to rain expected on Sunday. In both games of the doubleheader, Slaton led off and Duggar batted second in a lineup that the team used often for the remainder of the season. In the first game of the doubleheader, Clemson had an 8–4 win. Zack Erwin gave up no runs in 4.1 innings of relief pitching to get his second win. Duke won the series's final game, 13–1, after starter Firth and reliever Campbell combined to give up 11 earned runs in 3.2 innings.\nOn March 26 and 27, Clemson split its annual home-and-home midweek series with Georgia. Georgia entered the series having lost eight straight games. Clemson won, 9–1, in game one at Georgia's Foley Field. Duggar homered, Slaton went 4–5, and Crownover allowed one run in five innings to earn his third win. The Tigers lost game two, 5–3, at Doug Kingsmore Stadium. Georgia scored two runs in the first off of freshman starter Brody Koerner (in his second start of the season) and led for the entire game. The Bulldogs hit three home runs in the game.\nFrom March 30 – April 1, the team played a conference road series against #1 North Carolina, who entered the series with a 23–1 record; Clemson lost two of three games in the series. In game one, Gossett allowed eight runs in three innings, and Clemson lost, 10–3. Clemson lost again in game two, 6–2, in a game that was started on Sunday evening, delayed by rain, and completed on Monday afternoon. In Monday night's game three, televised on ESPNU, Clemson won, 5–4 in 11 innings. Crownover, in his first conference start, gave up three runs in 4.2 innings. Losing 3–1 after five innings, Clemson took a 4–3 lead in the sixth after Brittle hit a two-RBI single and Tyler Krieger scored on a wild pitch. North Carolina tied the game in the seventh on a run given up by Firth but charged to Schnell. The game was still tied, 4–4, into the top of the eleventh inning, when an RBI groundout by Boulware scored Jay Baum. North Carolina got two runners on base in the eleventh, but Firth, who had been taken out of the starting rotation after a poor start against Duke, retired the Tar Heels to win the game.\nAt the end of the North Carolina series, Clemson was 17–11 (6–6 ACC), after going 11–9 in March and splitting the two games completed on April 1.\nApril.\nIn an April 3 midweek game against Gardner-Webb, Meyer started his first game of the season. He went 7.0 innings and gave up one run, as Clemson won, 4–1. Boulware drove in two runs, and Campbell pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his fifth save.\nFrom April 5–7, the team took its longest road trip of the season to play a three-game series at Boston College. Boston College entered the series without having won an ACC game, and Clemson won all three games. Gossett started game one, which Clemson won, 7–5. After being down 2–0 early in the game, Clemson scored once in the sixth and six times in the seventh to take a 7–2 lead. Gossett gave up three runs in the bottom of the seventh, but Schnell got out of the inning without giving up more runs, and Erwin pitched 1.2 scoreless innings to earn his second save. Junior designated hitter Joe Costigan, who had had only eight at-bats entering the series, drove in three runs. Clemson won game two, 9–2. Schmidt started and gave up two runs in seven innings, and Boulware and Kennedy each drove in two runs. In game three, Clemson won, 1–0. McGibbon drove in the game's only run in the sixth, and Crownover and Campbell combined to hold Boston College scoreless. Wilkerson started at designated hitter in the game, his first start since game two of the North Carolina series due to a cut on his finger. The win was Clemson's fifth consecutive.\nClemson played a pair of midweek games in the following week, travelling to Western Carolina on Tuesday, April 9 and hosting Presbyterian on Wednesday, April 10. Clemson defeated Western Carolina, 12–9. Clemson led, 9–3, entering the seventh, but Erwin and Schnell combined to give up six runs in the bottom of the seventh, four of which were unearned due to an error by Wilkerson. The Tigers retook the lead in the ninth, due to an RBI single by McGibbon, a double steal on which Krieger scored, and an RBI single by Slaton. Firth pitched a scoreless ninth inning to earn his first save. Clemson also won against Presbyterian, 5–4. The Blue Hose led, 4–3, entering the eighth, but Clemson scored a run in both the eighth and ninth to win. In the eighth, Krieger tripled and scored on a wild pitch to tie the game. In the ninth, he hit a two-out, bases-loaded single to give the team its seventh consecutive win.\nGame log.\n! style=\"background:#330066;color:#FF6300;\"| Regular season\n! style=\"background:#330066;color:#FF6300;\"| Post-season"

        "title": "Rowing at the 1932 Summer Olympics – Men's coxed pair",
        "text": "The men's coxed pair competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles took place are at Long Beach Marine Stadium on 13 August. Competition consisted of a single round. There were 4 boats (12 competitors) from 4 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the United States, its first victory in the event. Coxswain Edward Jennings had also been on the bronze medal team in 1924, making him the fifth man with multiple medals in the coxed pair. The American rowers were Charles Kieffer and Joseph Schauers. Silver went to Poland, in its coxed pair debut (Jerzy Braun, Janusz Ślązak, and cox Jerzy Skolimowski). France earned bronze (Anselme Brusa, André Giriat, and cox Pierre Brunet).\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nNone of the crew members from the 1928 coxed pair event returned, though Edward Jennings had been the cox on the American bronze medal team in 1924.\nBrazil and Poland each made their debut in the event. France made its fifth appearance, the only nation to have competed in all editions of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). In sharp contrast to the 1928 tournament, which featured six rounds, the 1932 competition consisted of a single race. All four boats competed in the final. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912."

        "text": "Saint-Raphaël Var Handball, is a team handball club from Saint-Raphaël, Var, France, that plays in the LNH Division 1.\nSaint-Raphaël Var handball, or SRVHB, is a French handball club based in Saint-Raphael in the Var region, founded in 1963. The first team has been playing in Division 1 since the 2007–2008 season and has been coached since 2019 by Rareș Fortuneanu assisted by Wissem Hmam, both former players of the club.\nEven if the club has not won a title, apart from the French D2 Championship in 2007, it has accumulated places of honor including a French runner-up title in 2016, three League Cup finals, a Champions Trophy final in 2015 and an EHF European Cup (C3) final in 2018.\nHistory.\nThe original club was founded in 1959. It was after the disaster of the Malpasset dam in Frejus on 2 December 1959 that the leaders of the two cities merged the volleyball sections of the football clubs of the two cities, the Etoile Sportive Fréjussienne and the Stade Raphaélois to create the Association Sportive Fréjus Saint-Raphaël, commonly known as ASFSR. It was in 1963, at the initiative of René Cenni, that the handball section was born. Marcel Tafani was then appointed president of the section.\nIn 1971, the handball section created a women's team and found a home in a sports hall inaugurated on 7 November 1972 during a match against Draguignan: the Esterel sports hall. In 1974, the town of Fréjus created the AMSLF. The Raphael section, freshly promoted to National 3, was destabilized by the loss of many elements and went down to the regional championship the following year. Three years later, in 1977, the club lost its inter-municipal status. It lost its \"F\" and became A. S. S. R. for Association Sportive Saint-Raphaël. Over time, the club grew and evolved. It reached the National 3 level in 1983, National 2 in 1992 and National 1 in 1994.\nIn 1995, the section separated from the communal club and the club was created under the name Saint-Raphaël Var Handball. The club finally reached the elite in 2004 but was relegated the following season to D2. The Palais des sports Jean-François-Krakowski was inaugurated in 2005 during a gala match against Chambéry. The club returned to the LNH two years later, in 2007, after winning the D2 championship.\nSince his return in elite, coach Christian Gaudin has made the club one of the best in France, finishing 4th in 2010 and 2011 and 3rd in 2012. The club also reached the League Cup final three times (2010, 2012 and 2014), losing three times to Montpellier AHB. On March 18, 2014, the club's president announced, a year in advance, the end of Christian Gaudin's contract. \nHe was replaced by Joël da Silva, from Toulouse, who allowed the club to reach a new level by returning to 3rd place in 2015 and becoming vice-champion of France in 2016. Under his orders, the club also reached the final of the EHF European Cup in 2018.\nWith his contract set to expire in June 2019, Joel Da Silva has been replaced by his assistant Rareș Fortuneanu as coach. The former Romanian international, who played for Saint-Raphaël, has been assistant coach for the last 4 seasons. His assistant, Wissem Hmam also knew the SRVHB as a player.\nIn October 2020, Jean-François Krakowski decided to retire after 33 years at the head of the club and was replaced by Emmanuel Murzereau.\nClub-related players.\nIn \" 'bold' \", players currently at the club.\nTop scorers in the history of SRVHB in the league.\nIn \" 'bold' \", players currently at the club.\n- ‘'updated on April 30, 2020\" -\nOther personalities linked to the club.\nIn \" 'bold' \", players currently at the club.\nOrganigram of SRVHB.\nSaint-Raphaël Var Handball (SAOS)"

The race was won by Nico Rosberg for Mercedes AMG Petronas, repeating the feat of his father Keke Rosberg in the 1983 race. The race was the sixth round of the 2013 season, and marked the seventy-first time the Monaco Grand Prix has been held. Rosberg had started the race from pole.\nReport.\nBackground.\nTyres.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-banded super-soft compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre, just as they did the previous two years. It was the second time in the season that the super-soft compound was used at a race weekend, as was the case with the soft tyre compound.\nFree practice.\nThursday's Free Practice sessions saw many drivers struggling to find grip on the circuit, as Jean-Éric Vergne and Kimi Räikkönen both suffered major lock-ups at turn 4, and went off into the small run-off area. Lewis Hamilton locked up badly at turn 8, with his teammate, Nico Rosberg, touching the barrier at turn 7. Grosjean and Massa both crashed into the barriers at turn 1, and with Massa's crash being on Saturday morning's Free Practice session, he was unable to compete in qualifying. Adrian Sutil crashed into the outside barrier at turn 2.\nQualifying.\nThe three qualifying sessions were held on 25 May. Q1 and Q2 were rain-affected, with mostly dry conditions for Q3.\nQ1.\nForce India's Paul di Resta, Caterham's Charles Pic, Sauber's Esteban Gutiérrez, Marussia's Max Chilton and Jules Bianchi, and Ferrari's Felipe Massa did not make it out of the first qualifying session. Bianchi stopped on track with an engine issue before setting a timed lap. Massa did not run a lap as his car was still being repaired following a crash in Free Practice Session No. 3. Giedo van der Garde became the first Caterham driver to advance to the second round of qualifying in the 2013 season.\nQ2.\nSauber's Nico Hülkenberg, Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo, Lotus' Romain Grosjean, both Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Pastor Maldonado, as well as Caterham's Giedo van der Garde were knocked out and did not advance.\nQ3.\nMercedes's Nico Rosberg took pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix with a time of 1m13.876s. Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel set the next two fastest times during the final round of qualifying.\nRace.\nRosberg led from pole position ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton at the start and Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. Marussia's Bianchi started from pit lane after an issue on the starting grid. Maldonado and van der Garde had contact which forced Maldonado to pit the Williams for a new front wing. On lap 9, Charles Pic pulled over near the pit entry with an engine fire in the Caterham.\nFerrari's Felipe Massa had a large shunt going into Sainte Devote, very similar to his crash in the third free practice session on Saturday, but this time it was caused by a suspension failure. The safety car was deployed for the first time in the 2013 season and Rosberg retained the lead after a pit stop. Hamilton dropped to fourth place after leaving too much of a gap to the Red Bulls.\nOn lap 45, Maldonado and Chilton touched near Tabac sending Maldonado into the barriers. The race was red flagged to repair damage to the barriers and remove Maldonado's wrecked Williams, although Chilton was able to resume. The race resumed behind the safety car with Rosberg leading Vettel, Webber, and Hamilton. During the red flag stop, Sergio Pérez was given the position by Alonso, who was trying to avoid a penalty caused by an earlier incident at the chicane.\nLotus's Grosjean crashed into the back of Toro Rosso's Ricciardo exiting the tunnel and the safety car was brought out once again. After the race, it was announced that Grosjean would receive a 10-place grid penalty for the Canadian Grand Prix because of the crash.\nPérez touched the barriers near the Nouvelle Chicane after trying to overtake Räikkönen on lap 69, Räikkönen had to pit for new tyres following a puncture caused by the collision. Fernando Alonso, teammate Jenson Button and Räikkönen himself later complained about Pérez's aggressive driving during the race, even though he did not receive any penalties. Pérez later retired after running down the exit road near Rascasse.\nAfter Vettel set the race's fastest lap, 1:16.577, on lap 77 Red Bull reprimanded their driver over the radio for taking unnecessary risks, saying that there were no points to be gained for setting the fastest lap. Vettel replied \"but satisfaction\".\nRosberg won the race ahead of Vettel, Webber and Hamilton, having led from start to finish. His victory came 30 years after his father, Keke Rosberg, won the 1983 Monaco Grand Prix. Raikkonen passed several cars on the last two laps to take the final points position.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:"

It was the eighth round of the 2013 Formula One World Championship and the 64th British Grand Prix to be held as part of the series. Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg won the 52-lap race starting from second position. Mark Webber of the Red Bull team finished second and Fernando Alonso took third in a Ferrari.\nLewis Hamilton, Rosberg's teammate, won the pole position by setting the fastest lap in qualifying. He led for the first seven laps until his car's left-rear tyre failed on lap eight, promoting Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel to the lead. Two more left-rear tyre failures for Ferrari's Felipe Massa and Toro Rosso driver Jean-Éric Vergne led to race director Charlie Whiting deploying the safety car. The race was restarted at the end of lap 21 with Vettel leading. He led for the next 20 laps before a gearbox failure forced him to retire on the 41st lap and cause a second safety car deployment. Rosberg took the lead, and held off Webber for the rest of the race to achieve his second victory of the season and the third of his career.\nA total of six tyre failures occurred during the race and supplier Pirelli modified them to make them less susceptible to punctures for the following as a stop-gap solution before introducing a new tyre at the . Pirelli investigated the incidents and concluded there was no single cause. As a result of the race, Alonso moved to within 21 points of the World Drivers' Championship leader Vettel. Kimi Räikkönen of the Lotus team finished fifth to remain in third and Hamilton maintained fourth place. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes overtook Ferrari, moving to within 48 points behind Red Bull with eleven rounds remaining in the season.\nBackground.\nThe round was the eighth of the 19 races in the 2013 FIA Formula One World Championship, and the 64th British Grand Prix as part of the series. It was held at the 18-turn Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, Northamptonshire, England, on 30 June. Tyre supplier Pirelli brought the white-banded medium and the orange-banded hard compound dry tyres and the green-banded intermediate and dark blue-banded full wet tyres to the race. The drag reduction system (DRS) was expanded from one to two activation zones for 2013: one was on the Wellington Straight on the entry to Brooklands corner and the second was on the Hangar Straight linking Chapel and Stowe turns. For the race, several drains to improve circuit drainage and prevent water accumulation were installed, and the outside tyre wall at the exit to Chapel Curve was extended by .\nBefore the race, Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel led the World Drivers' Championship with 132 points, ahead of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso with 96 points and Lotus' Kimi Räikkönen with 88 points. Lewis Hamilton of the Mercedes team was fourth with 77 points and Vettel's teammate Mark Webber was fifth with 69 points. Red Bull led the World Constructors' Championship with 201 points; Ferrari and Mercedes were second and third respectively, with 145 and 134 points. Lotus were fourth with 114 points and Force India were fifth with 51 points.\nVettel won the preceding from Alonso, but did not want to speculate on the outcome at Silverstone or the championship. \"Fernando was a little bit unlucky here and there and we were able to beat him, so we were able to come back but this was ten races from where we are now so I think there are so many things that can happen at that stage of the championship.\" Alonso said Ferrari could not make more errors and lose extra points. He was confident about his prospects at Silverstone because of Ferrari's recent competitiveness there saying, \"We have an interesting weekend ahead of us, but we can approach it with confidence, knowing we have a good opportunity.\" Stirling Moss, the 1955 British Grand Prix winner for Mercedes, felt Hamilton could possibly win the race and Hamilton himself wanted to win at Silverstone for the second time. Hamilton said he was looking forward to learning how his car would perform and felt Mercedes would be competitive at Silverstone. His teammate Nico Rosberg commented his aim was to score points at the race.\nThe second mid-season test of 2013 was held at the circuit three weeks after the race. Auto GP driver Kimiya Sato and GP3 Series racers Daniil Kvyat and Carlos Sainz Jr. made their first appearances in a Formula One test session for the Sauber and Toro Rosso teams respectively, while World Series by Renault driver Will Stevens drove a Caterham. The Marussia team entered Tio Ellinas from the GP3 Series, and Susie Wolff drove a Williams car, becoming the first woman to drive a Formula One car in an official session since Giovanna Amati in . The Mercedes team were not allowed to enter the test because the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA; Formula One's governing body) International Tribunal concluded they broke the regulations by running its 2013 car in an illegal test session with Pirelli at the Circuit de Catalunya a month prior.\nThe Grand Prix saw 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) entering two drivers each for a total of 22 competitors and there were no changes from the season-entry list. James Rossiter, Force India's simulator driver, was due to drive a VJM06 car in lieu of Adrian Sutil during the first free practice session to gather simulation data until inclement weather cancelled the plan.\nSome teams modified their cars for the race. Ferrari introduced a new rear wing featuring an alteration in its vertical slot in the F138's endplate's lower front. Mercedes installed a cable-free thermic sensor on the F1 W04's front wing to monitor the front tyres. Lotus used a \"double DRS\" system on Räikkönen's E21 car to direct airflow and lower downforce for the first time in a race after evaluating it in Friday practice sessions in 2012 and the 2013 pre-season test session. The team also modified the car's suspension system, introduced a new front wing and multiple aerodynamic upgrades in anticipation of improving performance.\nPractice.\nPer the regulations for the 2013 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another 60-minute session on Saturday. The first session occurred in wet weather, which had moved in on Thursday afternoon. Water streams formed across some turns and several drivers lost control of their cars. No one set a fast lap until after 75 minutes since teams were reluctant to send drivers onto the wet track. Daniel Ricciardo of the Toro Rosso team set the fastest lap, a 1-minute, 54.249 seconds, ahead of Sauber's Nico Hülkenberg, Williams driver Pastor Maldonado, Hamilton, Sauber's Esteban Gutiérrez and Maldonado's teammate Valtteri Bottas in positions two to six. Charles Pic lost control of the rear of his Caterham and collided with the barrier at Club turn, removing the front wing. Gutiérrez aquaplaned at the first corner but regained control of his car.\nConditions improved as the rain showers eased up. The GP2 Series practice session removed some standing water, allowing drivers to head out as the second session began. Drivers used intermediate tyres early on, but used dry tyres after ten minutes. Rosberg recorded the day's fastest lap, a 1-minute, 32.248 seconds, with 40 minutes to go. The Red Bull duo of Webber and Vettel, Force India's Paul di Resta, Hamilton, Ricciardo and his Toro Rosso teammate Jean-Éric Vergne, Sutil, Lotus' Romain Grosjean and Alonso followed in positions two to ten. Felipe Massa was limited to seven timed laps because he lost control of the rear of his Ferrari on a damp area at the exit of Stowe corner, damaging the front suspension sliding across the inside tyre barrier before stopping at the pit lane entry.\nAfter the session, Hamilton was summoned to the stewards and received his first reprimand of the season for not complying with their instructions to remain to the right of a bollard for safety reasons entering the pit lane. In the final session, which took place in clear and warmer weather and saw both dry compound tyres used, Rosberg was again fastest with a 1-minute, 31.487 seconds lap. Hamilton, Vettel, Webber, Grosjean, Ricciardo, Alonso, Räikkönen, Sutil and Di Resta completed the top ten. McLaren's Sergio Pérez sustained a left-front tyre puncture at the exit to Copse turn, which was caused by an unidentified object creating a large cut in the wheel's sidewall and damaging the car's floor. Officials stopped the session briefly after 13 minutes to clean the track. Pérez's car was repaired for him to drive the final ten minutes before spinning backwards at Becketts Curve.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first 18-minute session eliminated cars that finished 17th or lower. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify. The second 15-minute session eliminated cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final ten-minute session determined pole position to tenth. Cars that progressed to the final session were not allowed to change tyres for the race's start, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times in the third session. Hamilton took his second pole position of the season and the 28th of his career with a time of 1 minute, 29.607 seconds on his final lap. He was joined on the grid's front row by his teammate Rosberg, who battled his teammate for pole position. Mercedes took its first front row lockout at Silverstone since Juan Manuel Fangio and Moss in 1955 and its third of 2013. Vettel took third and Webber was fourth after an error braking for Club corner lost him time. Di Resta and Sutil for Force India took fifth and seventh on a new set of medium tyres; Ricciardo separated the duo in sixth. Grosjean in eighth had an understeer on his final timed lap at turn 15, and his teammate Räikkönen in ninth had issues on the medium tyres.\nAlonso, tenth, switched from the hard to the medium compound tyres with the intention of entering the pit lane if his lap was poor. Button took 11th after not progressing to the final session by one-tenth of a second because he required a hard out-lap to generate tyre temperature. 12th-placed Massa was unable to set a fast enough lap after the loss of track time changing his engine after his crash the day before. Vergne, 13th, ran wide at the exit of Becketts Curve on his fastest lap, possibly because of the aerodynamic turbulence of airflow over Vettel's car removing downforce and causing the error. Pérez, 14th, had irrecoverable tyre temperature from being randomly instructed to drive onto the FIA weighbridge and traffic slowing him. Hülkenberg took 15th on his final lap ahead of the Williams duo of Maldonado and Bottas. Gutiérrez in 18th lost time exiting the corners. An improved car balance put Pic 19th, and Marussia's Jules Bianchi drove his improved car to 20th. Van Der Garde and Marussia's Max Chilton were 21st and 22nd respectively.\nPost-qualifying.\nAfter the session, the FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer found Di Resta and his Force India car without fuel to be under the minimum weight limit of and reported this to the stewards. They decided Force India broke series' regulations and ordered Di Resta to start from 22nd. The Force India team did not appeal the decision. Van Der Garde was demoted five grid positions after the stewards concluded he had collided with Hülkenberg at the preceding Canadian Grand Prix. A second five-place grid penalty was imposed on him because Caterham broke a seal to change his gearbox layshaft after qualifying.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions is denoted in bold.\nNotes:\nRace.\nThe 52-lap race took place in the afternoon of 30 June from 14:00 local time. The weather at the start was clear with the air temperature between and a track temperature from ; a gusty wind was present, and no rain was forecast. 120,000 attended the event. The first nine starters began on the medium compound tyres. The optimum strategy was for a driver to make three pit stops because it was faster and not be impeded by slower traffic. Hamilton made a brisk start to lead the field into the first corner. Vettel overtook the slow-starting Rosberg for second. Webber and Grosjean made contact through Abbey corner, damaging the former's carbon fibre front wing, and driving onto the run-off area and fell to 14th position.\nSutil progressed from sixth to fourth place, and Massa moved through traffic to go from eleventh to fifth. Driving towards Stowe turn, Alonso overtook Button on the inside for ninth. Hamilton led Vettel by eight-tenths of a second by the end of the first lap, with Rosberg third and Sutil fourth. Hamilton began to pull away from Vettel, his car was faster all round the track. Alonso discovered his Ferrari was better in cooler weather because of a favourable car balance. He passed Grosjean for eighth at the exit of Woodcote corner at the start on lap two after Grosjean ran wide at turn three, the result of his contact with Webber. Hamilton was two seconds ahead of Vettel by lap five, preventing Vettel from using DRS and allowing Hamilton to react a pit stop without losing position. That same lap, Alonso switched lines in an unsuccessful attempt to pass Ricciardo into Stowe corner and Grosjean caught up to him. By lap seven, Webber had recovered from 14th to 11th.\nAfter exiting turn five on lap eight, Hamilton's rear left tyre punctured and rapidly deflated on the Wellington Straight. Tyre rubber flew off the wheel and littered the track as Vettel swerved to avoid hitting it and took over the lead. Hamilton drove slowly to the pit lane for a replacement wheel and checks to his car; the wheel's sidewall stayed intact and fibres flailed on it. He rejoined the race on the hard compound tyres in 22nd; yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about on-track debris. One lap later, Alonso exited Stowe corner with a punctured right-rear tyre that did not delaminate, causing him to enter the pit lane for the hard compound tyres, falling to 11th. His teammate Massa, in fourth, sustained the race's third tyre failure on lap ten when his left rear wheel deflated in Aintree corner, spinning onto the run-off area. Massa entered the pit lane cautiously for a new set of tyres and fell to 22nd. Because of debris on the Wellington Straight, DRS was disabled on lap 11, and it was around this point that FIA race director Charlie Whiting considered stopping the race but decided not to.\nPirelli technicians took the rear tyre rubber to their garage for analysis, advised teams to raise pressures to and told drivers to avoid mounting the kerbs. Between laps 12 and 13, Alonso overtook the Lotus duo of Räikkönen and Grosjean on the Hangar Straight and Vergne into Brooklands corner to move into sixth. Grosjean blocked his teammate Räikkönen from passing him at Maggots corner. Red Bull called Vettel into the pit lane for his first pit stop on the 13th lap and retained the lead. On lap 14, the Lotus team asked Grosjean to allow his teammate Räikkönen into sixth. As he did so on the Hangar Straight linking Stowe corner, Vergne's left-rear tyre failed at and littered debris on the circuit. A large piece of tyre landed on Räikkönen's helmet, without causing him injury. Vergne entered the pit lane to switch to a new set of hard compound tyres. This fourth tyre failure along with tyre debris on the circuit caused Whiting to deploy the safety car.\nAs track marshals checked and cleared on-track debris with road clearing trucks, Vettel was told by radio the inside of his left-rear medium compound tyre that he began the race on had sustained cuts to it. Teams sought to lessen the amount of time spent on their tyres when the switch to making three stops became common. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of the 21st lap, and racing resumed with Vettel leading Rosberg and Sutil. Pérez overtook Webber on the inside into Abbey corner for eighth. Webber, whose front wing was changed earlier, retook eighth from Pérez on the inside at Brooklands turn. On lap 28, Ricciardo turned left into the same turn and passed Grosjean for sixth place. Gutiérrez front-left tyre's was punctured from a cut on the Hangar Straight linking Stowe corner on lap 28. The tyre, which did not delaminate, damaged his front wing, and left carbon fibre debris on the track. Alonso, who was close by Sutil, swerved to avoid the debris. On that lap, Webber overtook Grosjean into Brooklands corner for seventh.\nThe second round of pit stops commenced on the 30th lap. Räikkönen, Grosjean and Alonso were the first of the leaders to enter the pit lane for the hard compound tyres. As he was released, Alonso was forced to brake to avoid hitting Grosjean's car as he entered his pit stall, allowing Räikkönen past him. Over laps 31 and 32, Hamilton attempted two unsuccessful passes on Di Resta on the main straight and into Brooklands corner. Sutil and Rosberg made their second pit stops for the hard compound tyres over laps 33 and 34. On lap 35, Webber used DRS on the Hangar Straight into Stowe corner to pass Alonso for fourth position. Vettel made his second pit stop from the lead on the same lap for hard compound tyres. He retained the lead. On the 36th lap, Di Resta and Hülkenberg made contact in turn tree, damaging the former's front wing. After Hamilton exited the pit lane on the next lap, Di Resta passed him. Hamilton attempted to pass Di Resta again before Stowe corner. Instead, he narrowly avoided a rearward collision with the rear of Di Resta's car on lap 37. That same lap, Toro Rosso retired Vergne in the pit lane with significant damage to his car.\nHamilton overtook Di Resta for 11th at the exit of turn three on the following lap. Button passed Grosjean into Brooklands corner for ninth on lap 39. Ricciardo attempted to pass Sutil into Copse corner for sixth but Sutil blocked him by switching lines, slowing Ricciardo. On lap 41, Hamilton used DRS to pass Grosjean on the Hangar Straight for tenth On that lap, Vettel went to change to fifth gear into Vale corner when he lost drive. He drove slowly round Club turn and stopped at the side of the main straight next to pit wall to retire for the first time in 2013. This promoted Rosberg to the lead, Räikkönen to second and Webber to third. With Vettel's car deemed to be in a dangerous position, the safety car was deployed for the second time to allow his car to be moved safely from the track.\nThe safety car created a situation in which teams had to decide whether to make a pit stop to keep or gain position with nine laps to go. Rosberg and Webber made their stops at the end of lap 42 for the hard and medium tyres, respectively. Rosberg retained the lead as Webber fell to fifth. Räikkönen, Sutil and Ricciardo in positions two to four remained on the circuit. Rosberg was informed by radio of an issue with the centre of his left-rear tyre. Racing resumed at the conclusion of lap 45 when the safety car entered the pit lane. Webber overtook Ricciardo into Brooklands turn for fourth on lap 46, and Alonso passed Button for seventh into Copse turn. Entering the Hangar Straight, Alonso was slipstreaming Pérez at when Perez's left-rear tyre failed without warning and damaged his floor. Alonso turned right to avoid tyre debris from Pérez's car littering the track, as McLaren retired the latter in the pit lane.\nOn lap 47, Hamilton overtook Button for seventh and Webber deployed DRS to pass Sutil for third. Webber passed Räikkönen with DRS for second at Copse corner on the following lap, just as Ricciardo lost fourth to Alonso. On the 49th lap, Alonso and Hamilton demoted Sutil to fifth. Alonso had DRS available on lap 50 and used the extra grip in his tyres to pass Räikkönen for third. On the next lap, Hamilton used DRS to pass Räikkönen for fourth place. On the final lap, the Lotus team retired Grosjean in the pit lane because of front wing damage slowing him, just as Massa overtook Sutil for sixth. Rosberg held off Webber to take his second victory of the season and the third of his career, by seven-tenths of a second. Alonso took third, with Hamilton, Räikkönen, Massa, Sutil and Ricciardo in fourth to eighth. Di Resta was ninth after a late-race error, and Hülkenberg tenth after a slow puncture required him to make a pit stop earlier than scheduled. The final finishers were Maldonado, Bottas, Button, Gutiérrez, Pic, Bianchi, Chilton and Van Der Garde.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium interviews, conducted by 1996 world champion Damon Hill, Rosberg called it \"a very, very special day\" because of the progress the Mercedes team had made over the season. Webber said his team would have to investigate his slow start to the race and would have preferred more laps to have a chance of winning it. Alonso said he felt it was a lucky race for his team due to the loss of position after making a pit stop during the second safety car period. In the post-race press conference, Rosberg said he would not been able to catch and pass Vettel had the latter not retired due to a lack of overall speed. Webber said he was happy with his own performance and was looking forward to the next round. Alonso called the finish \"a fantastic result for our very difficult weekend\" because his car was inconsistent during a meeting—slow in qualifying but fast in a race.\nRosberg was summoned to the stewards to explain a perceived non-compliance of rules for not slowing enough for waved yellow flags and not overtaking early in the race between turns three and five. They reviewed telemetry and broadcast footage and imposed a reprimand on Rosberg. Vettel was disappointed to lose a potential victory with his gearbox failing late in the race, saying: \"These things unfortunately happen but fortunately we've got the next race coming up next week so we can try again.\" Räikkönen said his team Lotus had made a strategy error dropping him from second to fifth in the final laps: \"It's three races now where we haven't had the result we maybe expect, but hopefully if we can have a bit more luck and also get rid of some of the mistakes we'll be able to get back to the front.\" The team's head of trackside operations Alan Permane confirmed they had made a strategy error. Di Resta believed his team Force India would be happy to finish ninth and Ricciardo saw his eighth-place finish as \"a missed opportunity to score more points\" due to the fast pace of his car.\nButton on used, cold tyres said he was \"a sitting duck\" because he was vulnerable to being overtaken after the safety car was deployed: \"I was just waiting for people to pass me. It was tough.\" The race result kept Vettel atop the World Drivers' Championship with 132 points. Alonso's third-place finish allowed him to close up to 21 points behind. Räikkönen maintained third position, Hamilton fourth, and Webber fifth. Red Bull maintained their lead in the World Constructors' Championship with 219 points. The points Mercedes had accrued at Silverstone allowed them to overtake Ferrari for second position. Lotus maintained fourth place and Force India were in fifth with eleven races of the season remaining.\nTyre concerns.\nThe number of tyre failures during the race overshadowed Rosberg's victory. The press likened the situation to the 2005 United States Grand Prix, when seven teams running Michelin tyres were required to withdraw over safety concerns because their tyres were deemed unusable for racing, leaving six Bridgestone-shod cars to compete. A total of 20 tyre failures during the season caused the Grand Prix Drivers' Association to write a letter to Jean Todt, the FIA president, demanding action. Button, Vettel and Ferrari test driver Pedro de la Rosa met Todt to express their concerns to him.\nAfter several drivers and senior Formula One personnel asked for further action to be taken and had raised their concerns to the media, Todt ordered tyre supplier Pirelli to be present at a meeting of the Sporting Working Committee with team principals at the Nürburgring on 3 July to propose new measures to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring in the long-term. He had already asked Pirelli Motorsport director Paul Hembery, racing manager Mario Isola and Whiting to attend a meeting in the Silverstone paddock on the night after the race. Pirelli agreed to increase the strength of its tyres by changing the internal belts material from steel to flexible reinforced kevlar fibre to lessen the possibility of a puncture as a stop-gap solution for the following . The company received permission to introduce a new tyre featuring a combination of compound from 2012 and one from 2013 in time for the . The FIA restricted the practice of changing the left- and right-hand tyres around and limited camber and tyre pressures.\nAt its headquarters in Milan, Pirelli conducted its own investigation into the tyre failures observed during the race. The company concluded the failures were caused by incorrectly mounted rear tyres to attempt to regulate wear, low enough pressures subjecting tyres to additional stress, extreme camber angles on the suspension of cars and aggressive high kerbs. Pirelli emphasised the practice of incorrectly mounted tyres was not forbidden by the company but underestimated by all. It asked an FIA delegate to ensure teams did not under-inflate tyres and add excess camber angles on all cars.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold."

        "title": "2013 Italian Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2013 Italian Grand Prix (formally known as the 2013 Formula 1 Gran Premio d'Italia) was a Formula One motor race held on 8 September 2013 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Monza, Italy. The race was the 12th round of the 2013 season, and the 83rd running of the Italian Grand Prix.\nPrior to the weekend, Red Bull revealed that Daniel Ricciardo would be driving alongside Sebastian Vettel in 2014, taking over from Mark Webber, who moved to the Porsche Sportscar programme. Furthermore, Felipe Massa announced two days after the race that he would be leaving Ferrari at the end of 2013 after eight years with the team. On the next day, the Scuderia announced that former Ferrari driver and 2007 champion Kimi Räikkönen would take Massa's place.\nQualifying.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its hardest two compounds, with the orange-banded hard compound tyre being the harder \"prime\" tyre, and the white-banded medium compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre. This is the same tyre allocation as for the 2012 Italian Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull looked strong in all three practice sessions prior to qualifying. The two biggest threats to a Vettel pole position, apart for Vettel's teammate Mark Webber, were Lewis Hamilton and, quite surprisingly, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who had strong pace on a single lap Saturday morning, an area where Ferrari struggled throughout the season. Three-time 2013 pole-sitter Nico Rosberg had really poor mileage in the final practice session due to overheating and was unlikely to fight for pole because of this.\nQ1.\nDrivers eliminated in the first qualifying session were both drivers from Caterham and Marussia as well as Valtteri Bottas of Williams and Sauber's Esteban Gutiérrez. Several drivers were out on track early on option tyres, including 2007 champion Kimi Räikkönen and Jean-Éric Vergne.\nQ2.\nThe second qualifying session was the stage of a few surprises. First, both Lotus drivers were eliminated at the end of the 15 minutes session. Qualifying has never been the strength of the E21 this season, especially on the lowest downforce track of the season. The biggest disappointment of the session was the elimination of Hamilton's Mercedes. The five-time 2013 pole-sitter had an off at the exit of Curva Parabolica on his first flying lap and was impeded by Adrian Sutil on his second attempt at the entrance of the same turn. The German was later handed a three-place grid penalty for the race. It was the first time that Hamilton failed to make a Q3 appearance since the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix. As a result, Hamilton's streak of consecutive Q3 appearances ended at 66.\nQ3.\nBoth Ferraris and Red Bulls were out early as well as Rosberg's Mercedes. The red cars were using their towing tactic, which they practiced a lot during free practice. Vettel was the fastest man of that group with a time of 1:23.859. All ten cars then went out on track, either for a second run or for a first. Rosberg and Ricciardo were out first in the second wave as they opted for a two-flying lap run. Webber improved his time on his second run, but stayed second behind Vettel while the German also improved his fastest time to 1:23.755. Nico Hülkenberg set up for a massively impressive third place, especially with his teammate early exit in Q1. Ferrari's towing tactic did not do any good as the red cars could only manage fourth and fifth, with Felipe Massa in front of Alonso. Rosberg took a respectable sixth, considering his misfortune of Saturday morning. Ricciardo again showed great qualifying pace with seventh despite running wide at turn six. The McLaren duo could only manage eight and ninth, with Sergio Pérez in front, while Vergne had to settle for tenth with an off that was a near carbon copy of Hamilton's in Q2 at Curva Parabolica.\nRace.\nAt the start, Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel led the race from pole position with Felipe Massa jumping up into second position, ahead of Mark Webber and teammate Fernando Alonso. Further down the order, Lotus' Kimi Räikkönen was forced to put his left wheels on the grass to avoid Sergio Pérez on the approach of Variante del Rettifilo, preventing the Finn to brake in time and to avoid running in the back of the Mexican's McLaren. Räikkönen had to pit for a new front wing at the end of the first lap. More drama unfolded during the first lap as Paul di Resta ran into the back of Romain Grosjean's Lotus. The Scot lost his front left wheel and retired his car on the spot, while Grosjean's car was left unscathed by the incident. On lap three, Alonso made his move on Webber at Variante della Roggia for third place and the Spaniard later passed his teammate at Variante del Rettifilo on lap eight for second place.\nLewis Hamilton picked up a slow puncture early on in the race as well as radio problems. This meant that his team could not tell him about the tire problem and had to communicate with him with the help of pit boards throughout the rest of the race. Hamilton's one stop strategy became a two-stopper because of the slow puncture and rejoined the track almost at the back of the grid. Further ahead, Jean-Éric Vergne was on his way to a points finish until his transmission failed on lap fifteen.\nLater on, Webber managed to leapfrog Massa during the pit stops. The impressive Nico Hülkenberg managed to stay in front of Nico Rosberg for a net fifth place, but the recovering Hamilton passed both Germans at Curva Biassono and at Variante del Rettifilo respectively, though the Briton had to stop again because of his earlier tire problem. Räikkönen was also recovering from his first-lap clash with Pérez, taking advantage of a battle between Esteban Gutiérrez and Adrian Sutil, although Hamilton passed the three of them after his second pit stop. The Briton then quickly caught the McLaren duo and overtook them almost as quickly. Räikkönen also overtook Pérez and went after Jenson Button for tenth and the last championship point.\nAt the end of his 52nd lap, Sutil pulled into the Force India garage and retired with a brake problem. He was classified 16th, as he had completed 90% of the winner's race distance. A lap later, Sebastian Vettel crossed the start/finish line to win the 2013 Italian Grand Prix, his sixth win of the season, ahead of Alonso and teammate Webber. Massa drove to a respectable fourth, while Hülkenberg successfully beat Rosberg to the flag for a strong fifth place. Daniel Ricciardo took advantage of the great top speed of his Toro Rosso to successfully fight off Grosjean for a solid seventh. Hamilton recovered from his slow puncture to pick up ninth, while Button managed to hold Räikkönen behind him for tenth.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:"

        "title": "2013 Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2013 Singapore Grand Prix (formally known as the 2013 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that was held on Sunday, 22 September 2013 at 20:00 SST by the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. The race was the thirteenth round of the 2013 season, and marked the 6th running of the night race, the Singapore Grand Prix.\nSebastian Vettel took his most dominant victory statistically. He took pole position, led every lap, scored the fastest lap, and won by more than 32.6 seconds; his third Grand Slam. With a nearly perfect start and good handling of the safety car situation, Fernando Alonso took second position from seventh on the grid. Räikkönen, despite a back injury and a start from 13th, climbed up to the final podium position. Nico Rosberg, who started on the front row alongside Vettel, was caught out by a failed tyre strategy to finish fourth while British teammate Lewis Hamilton followed him home for 5th place.\nFelipe Massa took sixth, over a minute behind the race winner while Jenson Button slipped down the order in the last few laps to finish seventh with Sergio Pérez, Nico Hülkenberg and Adrian Sutil picking up the final points places. The results meant that Vettel again increased his championship lead to 60 points over Fernando Alonso with Lewis Hamilton a further 36 points behind and Kimi Räikkönen two behind Hamilton's total.\nBackground.\nThe circuit layout was revised for the 2013 race, with the removal of the \"Singapore Sling\" chicane at Turn 10. The corner was condensed down to a single change in direction, with the large kerbs that had been used to mark the chicane removed entirely.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-banded supersoft compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre, as opposed to the previous year where soft and supersoft selection were provided.\nQualifying.\nPirelli stated that their supersoft tyres are two seconds faster per lap than their medium compound, which meant that the teams had to establish a good tyre strategy for the weekend. Reigning triple world champion Sebastian Vettel took command in the final two practice sessions, while Lewis Hamilton was the fastest man in the first session. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg and Romain Grosjean were also strong contenders for pole position.\nQ1.\nThe two Red Bull drivers and Grosjean successfully qualified for the next session with the medium compound tyres, leaving their three sets of supersoft tyres unused for the following two sessions. The two drivers from Caterham and Marussia as well as Pastor Maldonado and Paul di Resta were eliminated during this session.\nQ2.\nThe biggest surprise of Q2 was the elimination of Lotus's Kimi Räikkönen. It was later revealed that the Finn suffered from a trapped nerve in his lower back on a quite bumpy circuit. Sauber's Esteban Gutiérrez qualified for Q3 for the first time in his young Formula One career. His teammate Nico Hülkenberg was on pace for a Q3 appearance as well, but the German suffered a DRS issue during his final flying lap, resulting in a Q2 exit. It was the first time this season that Hülkenberg could not out-qualify his teammate. Both Mercedes drivers qualified for Q3 on the set of supersoft tyres they previously used in Q1, which means that they joined Vettel, Grosjean and Mark Webber as the drivers who still had two sets of new supersoft tyres for Q3.\nQ3.\nThe five drivers with two unused sets of supersoft tyres went out on track early in the session for a first flying lap. Vettel was by far the fastest man of that group, lapping in 1:42.841, more than six-tenths of a second faster than Rosberg. As a result, the defending world champion elected to stay in the pits, while the others all went on track, either for a first or a second flying lap, except Esteban Gutiérrez, who opted to save his tyres for the race. What seemed to be a guaranteed pole position for Vettel proved to be very uncertain as the German watched Webber posting the fastest first sector time, quickly followed by successive fastest second sector times by Rosberg and Grosjean. Vettel's time still stood by less than a tenth, ahead of Rosberg and Grosjean. Webber took fourth in front of Hamilton. The Ferrari duo could only manage sixth and seventh, with Felipe Massa in front of Fernando Alonso. Jenson Button had to settle for eighth, while the impressive Daniel Ricciardo posted yet another Q3 appearance with ninth. Gutiérrez started in tenth place after not posting a lap time to save his tyres for the race.\nRace.\nThe race began Sunday, 22 September 2013 at 20:00 SST. Sebastian Vettel started from pole ahead of Nico Rosberg with Adrian Sutil the only driver starting on the medium compound 'Prime' tyre.\nRosberg got a better start than Vettel into the first corner but ran wide allowing Vettel back through. Fernando Alonso who started seventh got a good start to move up to third. Vettel gained a five-second advantage over Rosberg in the first three laps and continued to pull away as Rosberg also pulled away from Alonso. Mark Webber overtook Romain Grosjean early on using DRS to move back up to fourth. Lewis Hamilton had a bad start falling behind both Ferraris. He overtook Massa back soon after but the move was deemed to be an illegal overtake by the stewards as it took place off the track, meaning he had to give the position back. After the first few laps Vettel led from Rosberg, Alonso, Webber, Grosjean, Massa, Hamilton, Button, Hülkenberg and Pérez.\nKimi Räikkönen who started 13th and had a bad back quickly moved up the order overtaking Esteban Gutiérrez and Daniel Ricciardo who both started in the top 10. Webber chased down Alonso before being instructed to stay around two seconds behind Alonso so he would not overheat his tyres or engine. The race was then mostly uneventful as Vettel extended his lead to around seven seconds before Räikkönen became the first driver to stop on lap 11. This sparked a chain reaction showing the tyres had not lasted as long as expected. Hamilton jumped Massa in this first round of stops. Paul di Resta kept going until lap 21 before stopping to change his worn option tyres and in doing so slowed down Alonso and allowed Webber, Grosjean and Rosberg to bunch up behind Alonso. Räikkönen used his early stop to move into the points ahead of Hülkenberg, Pérez and Button but at the front Vettel stretched out the lead even further to over 10 seconds until Ricciardo, Vettel's Red Bull teammate for 2014, crashed under the grandstand bringing out the safety car. This meant that the safety car had been used in every Singapore Grand Prix. Shortly after the safety car came in, Grosjean had pneumatic problems in his engine and have to retire after a failed rescuing repair attempt. Vettel quickly pulled away from the rest by about two seconds per lap until he is able to pit without losing the lead. Di Resta was running in 10th before he crashed into the barriers. Webber's car discovered a water leak which slowed him down before it caught fire on the final lap.\nPost-race.\nAlonso stopped in the middle of Turn 7 to pick up Webber, who had retired on the final lap of the race. The stewards gave reprimands to the both of them for their actions. Crucially, Webber earned his third reprimand of the season, thus triggering an automatic 10-place grid penalty at the next race in Korea.\nA controversy developed after some spectators booed at Sebastian Vettel during the podium ceremony, prompting the TV interviewer Martin Brundle to break off and tell the jeering crowd to be quiet politely. The crowd's behaviour, which was not the first such incident directed at Vettel during the 2013 season, drew condemnation from Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, fellow driver Lewis Hamilton and former world champion Niki Lauda, among others."

        "text": "The 2013 Japanese Grand Prix (formally known as the 2013 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 13 October 2013 at the Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Japan. The race was the fifteenth round of the 2013 season, and marked the 39th running of the Japanese Grand Prix. The race, contested over 53 laps, was won by Sebastian Vettel, driving a Red Bull after starting from second on the grid. Mark Webber, who started on pole position, settled for second after being forced to switch to a three stop strategy, which in the end was not successful. Romain Grosjean took his second podium in succession in third position for Lotus F1. This was Red Bull's 14th one-two finish in Formula One.\nThe result meant that the title was not sealed at Suzuka but Vettel could win the title with fifth place at the next race in India. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso stretched his lead to 30 points over Kimi Räikkönen but was still 90 behind Vettel's total.\nRäikkönen in turn also increased his lead over Lewis Hamilton to 16 points after the Briton retired from puncture damage after colliding with Vettel on lap one. The result also meant that only Alonso could deprive Vettel of becoming world champion as Hamilton and Räikkönen fell out of contention.\nReport.\nBackground.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its Orange-banded hard compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the White-banded Medium compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre, as opposed to the previous year where hard and soft selection were provided. Jules Bianchi and Charles Pic were each given ten-place grid penalties after stewards found they had been speeding behind the safety car at the previous round in Korea. Both drivers were reprimanded for their actions, and automatically received a ten-place grid penalty as it was their third reprimand of the season.\nFree practice.\nFree Practice 1 saw Heikki Kovalainen drive for Caterham, in place of Charles Pic. The session was not without incident, as both Jules Bianchi (Marussia), Giedo van der Garde (Caterham) both went off at the exit of the second Degner corner. As a result of his accident, Bianchi was forced to sit out of Free Practice 2, while his car was repaired. Pastor Maldonado suffered a loose wheel up at Spoon Curve. Williams were later fined €60,000 for failing to attach the wheel properly. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest lap of the session, with teammate Nico Rosberg behind him.\nFree Practice 2 saw Pastor Maldonado also going off at the second Degner corner, where he became stuck in the gravel. Sergio Pérez lost control of his McLaren going into Spoon, and slid backwards and made heavy contact with the tyre barrier. Fernando Alonso spun at the second Degner corner, but he was able to continue. Kimi Räikkönen spun into the gravel trap at the Dunlop corner and was forced to end his session. This time championship leader Sebastian Vettel finished the session fastest, with teammate Mark Webber behind him.\nQualifying.\nIn a first, Charles Pic was given a drive-through penalty for leaving the pits when the red light was displayed at the pit exit during qualifying. The penalty was to be served during the first five laps of the race.\nRace.\nAt the start, Romain Grosjean made a superb start to lead into the first corner, behind him there was drama with Mark Webber making contact with Lewis Hamilton causing the latter to have a puncture, also there was a collision between the Marussia of Jules Bianchi and the Caterham of Giedo van der Garde sending both cars into the barriers at the first corner, fortunately both cars were removed quickly so no safety car was needed. Hamilton pitted to change his punctured tyre but retired on lap 7 with floor damage. Grosjean led until the pit stops but careful tyre management from Sebastian Vettel during the second phase of the race meant he was able to pass Grosjean and go on to win the race. On the penultimate lap Webber then caught and passed Grosjean to make it a Red Bull 1-2, with Grosjean having to settle for 3rd. Fernando Alonso claimed 4th with Nico Hülkenberg in fifth. Kimi Raikkionen managed 6th although he was some 40 seconds behind his teammate Grosjean. Esteban Gutierrez had the strongest race of his career with 7th beating Nico Rosberg who had to serve a drive through penalty for an unsafe release in the pits.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:\n — Adrian Sutil received a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change. However, he chose he demoted two-five places for causing a deliberate accident at the previous race. \n — Charles Pic and Jules Bianchi received ten-place grid penalties for receiving three reprimands over the season. However, due to Sutil's grid penalty Pic and Bianchi were promoted to 20th and 21st respectively."

After making their List A debut in the 1965 Gillette Cup the county played four matches in the competition up to the 1970. Minor counties were not a regular feature of the competition until the 1982 NatWest Trophy after which Norfolk took part every year until the 1985 competition and then from 1990 until 2004, the last year in which all Minor Counties were included.\nThe knock-out nature of the Gillette Cup means that in most competitions Norfolk only played one match, generally against a first-class county. The exceptions were in 2000 and 2002 when Norfolk won their opening round match on each occasion and, in 2002, advanced to the third round of the competition after winning two matches. From the 2002 competition onwards the opening rounds of the tournament were held during the previous English cricket season. As a result, Norfolk's last List A match, in the 2004 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy, actually took place in August 2003.\nPlayers are listed alphabetically with the number of matches played and the calendar years in which they made their first and last appearances in List A cricket for Norfolk.

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2013 season began on January 4, 2014. The postseason tournament concluded with the Seattle Seahawks defeating the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII, 43–8, on February 2, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nSchedule.\nIn a change from previous seasons, both late games during the Divisional Playoffs were AFC games (as opposed to each conference having both an early game on one day and a late game on the other day).\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games, then CBS broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games. Fox televised the rest of the NFC games and the Super Bowl. All games were broadcast on Westwood One radio.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 4, 2014.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 45, Kansas City Chiefs 44.\nTrailing 38–10 a few minutes into the third quarter, Indianapolis scored 35 second half points to overcome a 28-point deficit to win, 45–44, in the second biggest comeback victory in NFL postseason history, behind just the Buffalo Bills' 32-point deficit in their 41–38 comeback Wild Card game win against the Houston Oilers in 1992. For Kansas City, the loss extended their playoff win drought to 20 years.\nThe game got off to a rough start for the Chiefs, as starting running back Jamaal Charles was knocked out of the game on the opening drive. But before this, he rushed three times for 18 yards as the team drove 84 yards in 14 plays. Quarterback Alex Smith added a 16-yard run, and converted the drive's only third down with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Bowe. Indianapolis quarterback Andrew Luck quickly led his team back, completing seven consecutive passes for 74 yards. Four of them went to T. Y. Hilton, including a 24-yarder and a 10-yard touchdown catch to tie the game at 7. On the next possession, Smith completed a 68-yard pass to Bowe at the Colts 2-yard line. But the team could not get into the end zone with their next three plays and had to settle for Ryan Succop's 19-yard field goal to take a 10–7 lead. Then after a Colts three-and-out, Smith launched a 79-yard touchdown bomb to Donnie Avery, increasing the Chiefs lead to 17–7 21 seconds into the second quarter.\nThe situation continued to deteriorate for Indianapolis. On the first play of their next possession, Trent Richardson lost a fumble that linebacker Justin Houston recovered and returned seven yards to the Colts 17-yard line. Two plays later, Smith's 5-yard touchdown throw to fullback Anthony Sherman on a shovel pass made the score 24–7. This time the Colts managed to respond with a 61-yard scoring drive in which Luck completed a 16-yard pass to Griff Whalen and rushed for a 21-yard gain after faking a hand off up the middle on a fourth and 1 conversion. Adam Vinatieri finished the drive with a 37-yard field goal, cutting the score to 24–10. However, Smith also got to pass and rush, as he carried the ball four times for 24 yards and completed five passes for 33 on an 81-yard drive that ended with Knile Davis' 4-yard touchdown run, putting the Chiefs up 31–10. The Colts managed to reach midfield on their next possession, but Brandon Flowers intercepted a pass from Luck to keep them from scoring before halftime.\nOn the first play of the second half, Husain Abdullah intercepted Luck and returned the ball four yards to the Colts' 18-yard line, sitting up Smith's 10-yard scoring toss to Davis that put them up by 28, 38–10. It seemed that Kansas City was in complete control of the game, but Indianapolis suddenly stormed back with 14 unanswered points. First, Luck's 46-yard completion to reserve receiver Da'Rick Rogers moved the ball to the Chiefs' 10-yard line, and Donald Brown ran the ball into the end zone on the next play. Then linebacker Robert Mathis forced a fumble while sacking Smith, and fellow linebacker Kelvin Sheppard recovered for the Colts on the Chiefs' 41-yard line just before it rolled out of bounds. The offense then capitalized with Luck completing four out of five passes, the last a 3-yard scoring pass to Brown that cut the score to 38–24.\nFollowing a Chiefs punt, Abdullah intercepted another pass from Luck. Kansas City took over on the Indianapolis 28-yard line, and scored on a 42-yard Succop field goal to give them a 17-point lead, 41–24, with just over five minutes left in the third quarter. But Luck quickly led the Colts back, completing a 25-yard pass to Brown on the first play of the next possession, and later hooking up with LaVon Brazill for a 35-yard gain before finishing it off with a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Coby Fleener. Then after a three-and-out, Kansas City punter Dustin Colquitt's 31-yard boot pinned Indianapolis back at their own 10-yard line. But it did not stop the Colts, as Luck completed five out of six passes for 61 yards and rushed for 12 on a 90-yard scoring drive. On the last play, Brown fumbled the ball while trying to run it into the end zone, but it bounced right back into the hands of Luck, who took it across the goal line himself for a touchdown. With this score, the lead was cut to 41–38 with 10:38 left in the game.\nAided by A. J. Jenkins' 27-yard reception, the Chiefs managed to run the clock down to 5:36 with their ensuing drive. Succop finished it off with a 43-yard field goal to put the team up by six points. But three plays after the kickoff, Luck fired a deep pass to Hilton over the middle, who caught it without breaking stride and took off for a 64-yard touchdown catch, giving Indy their first lead of the game at 45–44. With 4:21 left, Kansas City desperately tried to get in range for a go-ahead field goal. Smith started the drive with a pair of completions to Bowe for 38 yards. But after a 3-yard running play moved the ball to the Colts 39-yard line, Smith was flagged for a 10-yard intentional grounding penalty. The next play netted the team six yards, bringing up fourth down and 11. On the next play, Smith threw a deep pass to Bowe along the right sideline. Bowe made a leaping catch with enough yardage for a first down, but landed with only one foot in bounds, causing a turnover on downs and allowing Indianapolis to run out the rest of the clock.\nFor Kansas City, Smith finished the game 30-for-46 for 378 yards and four touchdowns, while also rushing for 57 yards. His top receiver was Bowe, who caught eight passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. Davis rushed for 67 yards, caught seven passes for 33 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Abdullah had six tackles and two interceptions. For Indianapolis, Luck finished 29-for-45 for 443 yards and four touchdowns, with three interceptions. He also rushed for 45 yards and scored a fumble recovery touchdown. Hilton caught 13 passes for 224 yards – the third highest total in postseason history – and two touchdowns.\nBoth teams combined for 1,049 total yards (513 for Kansas City, 536 for Indianapolis), an NFL postseason record. This was the first wildcard playoff game ever to feature two former number one draft picks at quarterback; Smith in 2005 and Luck in 2012. This was the eighth consecutive playoff loss for Kansas City, an NFL record.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Colts and Chiefs. Indianapolis won all three prior meetings, including 23-8 in the 2006 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 26, Philadelphia Eagles 24.\nSaints kicker Shayne Graham, who was signed by the team just a few weeks before this game, kicked four field goals, the last a game winner as time expired to give the team their first road playoff win in franchise history.\nThe first quarter of the game was scoreless. The farthest the Saints made it was to the Eagles 49-yard line, and that drive ended when Drew Brees was intercepted by Bradley Fletcher, who returned the ball 24 yards to the New Orleans 27-yard line. After the turnover, Philadelphia drove to the Saints 15-yard line, but New Orleans' defense made two key plays to prevent a score. First, Curtis Lofton tackled tight end Brent Celek on a screen pass for an 8-yard loss. Then defensive end Cameron Jordan sacked Nick Foles for an 11-yard loss, pushing the Eagles all the way back to the 34-yard line. Following a 4-yard gain on third down, Alex Henery missed a 48-yard field goal 34 seconds into the second quarter.\nAfter the miss, New Orleans drove 43 yards to score on Graham's 36-yard field goal and take the lead, aided by a replay review that caused officials to overturn a lost fumble by tight end Jimmy Graham. New Orleans subsequently forced the Eagles to punt on their next drive, but then linebacker DeMeco Ryans intercepted Brees and returned the ball 23 yards to the Saints' 44-yard line. Philadelphia receiver Riley Cooper started off their possession with a 22-yard reception, and finished it with a 10-yard touchdown catch to give the Eagles a 7–3 lead. New Orleans responded with a 47-yard scoring drive, with Brees completing a 17-yard pass to Jimmy Graham and a 13-yarder to Kenny Stills on the way to a 46-yard field goal by Shayne Graham with less than two minutes left in the half, cutting the score to 7–6 going into halftime.\nPhiladelphia was forced to punt on their opening drive of the second half, and Darren Sproles returned the ball 12 yards to the Saints 47-yard line. Aided by Mark Ingram's three carries for 24 yards, New Orleans drove 53 yards to score their first touchdown on Brees' 24-yard pass to receiver Lance Moore, giving them a 13–7 lead. The next time New Orleans had the ball, they matched that feat with a 66-yard scoring drive. Tight end Benjamin Watson caught a 24-yard pass, while Ingram had five carries for 26 yards, the last a 4-yard touchdown run that put his team up 20–7. The Eagles managed to respond, with Foles' 40-yard completion to DeSean Jackson setting up a 1-yard touchdown run by LeSean McCoy, trimming their deficit to 20–14 with just over 30 seconds left in the third quarter.\nNew Orleans went three-and-out on their next drive, and Jackson's 29-yard punt return to the Saints' 40-yard line set up Henery's 30-yard field goal. But Brees' 40-yard completion to Robert Meachem helped move the Saints in range for another Graham field goal to put them back up by six points at 23–17. Taking the ball back with just over eight minutes left in regulation, the Eagles managed to drive 77 yards to take the lead, aided by a 40-yard pass interference penalty on Corey White. Foles finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown toss to tight end Zach Ertz, giving the Eagles a 24–23 lead with 4:54 remaining. However, the Saints would need to cover little ground for their game-winning drive, as Sproles returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards, with a horse-collar tackle penalty on Cary Williams adding on another 15. As a result, New Orleans got the ball on the Eagles' 48-yard line and needed just 34 yards to set up Graham's game-winning 32-yard field goal – as time expired – which they managed to space out over 10 plays to run the clock down to three seconds on the play.\nFoles finished his first playoff game completing 23 of 33 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns. Cooper was the top receiver of the game with six catches for 68 yards. Ryans had 10 tackles – eight of which were solo tackles – and an interception. Brees threw for 250 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. Ingram was the game's top rusher with 18 carries for 97 yards and a touchdown, while also catching three passes for 17 yards.\nThis game was notable for featuring two starting quarterbacks who went to the same high school, Westlake High School in Austin, Texas; Brees graduated in 1997, while Foles graduated in 2007, ten years apart from each other.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Saints and Eagles. The teams split the two previous meetings. New Orleans won the last meeting 27–24 in the 2006 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nSunday, January 5, 2014.\nAFC: San Diego Chargers 27, Cincinnati Bengals 10.\nAlthough the Bengals outgained San Diego in total yards, 439–319, and first downs, 27–16, the Chargers defense forced four turnovers, two failed fourth down conversion attempts, and shut out Cincinnati in the second half to give the Bengals their first home loss of the season and their sixth consecutive playoff loss since 1990.\nAfter a pair of punts started the game, San Diego drove 86 yards in 12 plays, including a 22-yard reception by tight end Ladarius Green, and scored on Danny Woodhead's 5-yard touchdown run. Following two more punts, Cincinnati tied the score with a 60-yard scoring drive. The key player on it was rookie running back Giovani Bernard, who rushed five times for 28 yards and caught a pass for 11. Quarterback Andy Dalton finished the possession with a 4-yard scoring pass to tight end Jermaine Gresham, his first postseason touchdown pass in three playoff games. After a San Diego three-and-out, the Bengals appeared to gain momentum with Dalton's 49-yard completion to receiver Marvin Jones. But on the next play, linebacker Donald Butler forced a fumble from Bernard that Richard Marshall recovered for the Chargers in the end zone and returned 13 yards to the 11-yard line. San Diego was forced into a three-and-out again, and Cincinnati got the ball back on their own 32-yard line with 1:14 left in the half. Dalton subsequently completed three passes for 41 yards to set up Mike Nugent's 46-yard field goal, giving the Bengals a 10–7 first half lead.\nHowever, that was all Cincinnati accomplished as the Chargers took over in the second half. After forcing the Bengals to punt on their opening second half drive, Philip Rivers completed a 33-yard pass to Eddie Royal that set up his 4-yard touchdown toss to Green, giving the Chargers the lead at 14–10. Then Dalton lost a fumble at the end of a 12-yard run without being touched, and Jahleel Addae recovered for San Diego on the Bengals' 46-yard line. The Chargers then drove 40 yards in nine plays to go up 17–10 with Nick Novak's 25-yard field goal. Then after two plays on the Bengals next drive, cornerback Shareece Wright intercepted a pass from Dalton and returned it 30 yards to the Cincinnati 3-yard line, setting up another Novak field goal that made the score 20–10. Dalton threw another interception on the ensuing possession, this one to linebacker Melvin Ingram. Although the Chargers would not convert this one into points, the Chargers' defense would go on to pin down the Bengals for the rest of the game. For their final three drives, they turned the ball over on downs twice in Chargers territory, while their final drive ended as time expired on the Chargers' 6-yard line. Meanwhile, a 58-yard touchdown run by San Diego running back Ronnie Brown made the final score 27–10.\nRivers finished the day 12-for-18 for 128 yards and a touchdown, with no interceptions. Dalton finished 29-for-51 for 334 yards and a touchdown – and rushed for 26 yards – but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble. Bernard rushed for 45 yards and caught seven passes for 73. Jones caught eight passes for 130 yards, setting a postseason franchise record and making him the first Bengals player to have over 100 receiving yards in a playoff game since Cris Collinsworth in the 1983 season. Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who had 1,426 receiving yards during the season, finished the game with just three catches for 34 yards. It was the last postseason win for the Chargers, before relocating back to Los Angeles in 2017.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chargers and Bengals. Cincinnati won the previous meeting 27–7 in the 1981 AFC Championship Game, also known as the \"Freezer Bowl\".\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 23, Green Bay Packers 20.\nIn the previous postseason, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick had shredded the Packers for 444 total yards of offense, including 181 rushing yards. This time, they managed to contain him a little better, but the final result was still the same: a Green Bay loss. Kaepernick racked up 325 offensive yards, and with five minutes left, he led the team on a 65-yard drive to set up Phil Dawson's game-winning field goal.\nDue to the 2014 North American cold wave, the game was initially expected to be one of the coldest playoff games in NFL history. But with a temperature of at kickoff time, it was warmer than the record set during the 1981 AFC Championship Game.\nAfter the Packers punted on their opening drive, San Francisco started off the scoring with a 69-yard drive, featuring a 31-yard completion from Kaepernick to Michael Crabtree, that ended with Dawson's 22-yard field goal. Green Bay was subsequently forced to punt again, and Tim Masthay's kick went just 29 yards to the Packers' 49-yard line. Frank Gore rushed four times for 21 yards for the 49ers as they drove 42 yards to go up 6–0 on Dawson's second field goal.\nThe Packers were forced to a three-and-out on their next drive, but this time their defense managed to step up and make a big play. Early in the second quarter, cornerback Tramon Williams intercepted the ball from Kaepernick and returned it 17 yards to the Green Bay 30-yard line. After the turnover, Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed six of seven passes for 45 yards as the team went 70 yards and 14 plays on a drive in which they never gained more than nine yards on a single play. Rodgers capped it off with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson that gave the Packers a 7–6 lead. In a notable contrast, the 49ers quickly struck back, scoring with just five plays as Kaepernick took off for a 42-yard gallop to set up Gore's touchdown on a 10-yard run. Green Bay responded with Rodgers completing a 19-yard pass to Nelson and a 13-yarder to running back James Starks on a 59-yard drive that ended with Mason Crosby's 34-yard field goal as time expired in the half, making the score 13–10 at halftime.\nSan Francisco drove to the Green Bay 25-yard line on the first drive of the second half, but on third down, linebacker Nick Perry sacked Kaepernick for an 8-yard loss and the 49ers decided to punt rather than attempt a long field goal. Following one more punt from each team, Rodgers led the Packers on an 80-yard drive to take a 17–13 lead on fullback John Kuhn's 1-yard touchdown run. The highlight of the drive was a fourth down conversion in which Rodgers managed to power out of a tackle attempt and throw a pass to Randall Cobb for a 26-yard gain. However, like Green Bay's earlier touchdown, the 49ers quickly struck back, starting with LaMichael James' 37-yard kickoff return to the 37-yard line. Kaepernick then broke off a 24-yard run and soon finished the drive with a 28-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis, retaking the lead for the 49ers at 20–17.\nTaking the ball back with just over 10 minutes left in regulation, Rodgers led the Packers back with four completions for 46 yards, including a 25-yard pass to Cobb. Crosby finished the drive with a 24-yard field goal, re-tying the game with 5:16 to go. But this was matched by the 49ers, who drove 65 yards for the game-winning score. Kaepernick completed three passes for 39 yards along the way, two for 28 to Crabtree, and also rushed for 11. Gore also played a key role, rushing five times for 15 yards, including four consecutive carries that forced Green Bay to use up all their timeouts. With three seconds left, Dawson managed to narrowly get his 33-yard field goal inside the right upright to give the 49ers a 23–20 win.\nRodgers finished the day 17-for-26 for 177 yards and a touchdown, along with 11 rushing yards. Kaepernick completed 16 of 30 passes for 227 yards and a touchdown, with one interception; he also rushed seven times for 98 yards. Crabtree was the leading receiver of the game with eight receptions for 125 yards, while 49ers linebacker Ahmad Brooks had six tackles, two sacks, and a forced fumble.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the 49ers and Packers, and was their second consecutive postseason meeting. Green Bay previously won four of the prior six meetings. San Francisco won 45–31 in the 2012 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 11, 2014.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 23, New Orleans Saints 15.\nThe last time these two teams met in the playoffs, Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch had rushed for 131 yards and a touchdown in a winning effort. This time, Lynch rushed for 140 yards and two scores to help the Seahawks advance to their second NFC Championship Game since 2005, despite quarterback Russell Wilson only completing nine of 18 passes for 108 yards. This was the Seahawks' fifth consecutive home playoff win, as they have not lost at home in the playoffs since being defeated by the St. Louis Rams in 2004.\nThe Seahawks dominated the first half, jumping to a 16–0 lead while holding Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who had passed for over 5,000 yards during the season, to just 34 yards. New Orleans was forced to punt on their opening drive, and punter Thomas Morstead bobbled the rain-soaked ball at the snap before shanking a 16-yard kick that gave Seattle a first down on the Saints' 40-yard line. The Seahawks then drove 20 yards, aided by a penalty for unnecessary roughness on safety Rafael Bush, and took a 3–0 lead on Steven Hauschka's 38-yard field goal. New Orleans responded with a drive to the Seattle 27-yard line, but Shayne Graham missed a 47-yard field goal attempt. Seattle then drove 34 yards and increased their lead to 6–0 with Hauschka's second field goal, this one from 49 yards out with 37 seconds left in the first quarter.\nOn the first play of the second quarter, defensive end Michael Bennett forced and recovered a fumble by New Orleans running back Mark Ingram II on the Saints' 24-yard line. Following a 9-yard run by Percy Harvin, Lynch scored on a 15-yard touchdown carry to increase Seattle's lead to 13–0. Later on, the Saints got a scoring opportunity when Jon Ryan's 24-yard punt gave them a first down on the Seahawks' 48-yard line. But they could only get to the 29-yard line, and on fourth down and 4, linebacker Bobby Wagner ended the drive by breaking up Brees' pass. On the Seahawks' ensuing drive, Lynch broke off an 18-yard run, while Wilson completed a 16-yard pass to Harvin and rushed for 25 yards himself, as the team drove 68 yards to take a 16–0 first-half lead on Hauschka's third field goal.\nOn the Saints' first drive of the second half, they managed to reach the Seahawks 34-yard line. But once again they failed to score as Bennett and Cliff Avril sacked Brees for a 10-yard loss on third down, pushing New Orleans out of field goal range. The Saints built some momentum towards the end of the quarter, on Brees' 23-yard completion to reserve tight end Josh Hill. On the next play, Brees' 25-yard completion to Marques Colston gave the team a first down on the Seattle 14-yard line, and they eventually scored with Khiry Robinson's 1-yard touchdown run. Ingram ran for a successful 2-point conversion, cutting their deficit to 16–8 early in the fourth quarter. New Orleans then forced a punt and seemed primed to score again when Brees completed a 30-yard pass to Kenny Stills from the Saints' 42-yard line; the play was negated by a holding penalty on offensive tackle Zach Strief, forcing a punt. By the time they got the ball back again, only 5:31 remained. They subsequently drove to the Seattle 30-yard line, but Graham missed a 48-yard field goal, giving the ball back to the Seahawks with 3:51 to go.\nFaced with third down and 3 after their first two plays, Wilson managed to complete a 24-yard pass to Doug Baldwin for a first down. On the next play, Lynch took off for a 31-yard touchdown run, giving the Seahawks a 23–8 lead. Brees completed six of eight passes as he led his team down the field 80 yards in nine plays, the last coming on fourth down and six from the Seahawks' nine-yard line when he found Colston in the end zone for a touchdown. Graham kicked the extra point to pull New Orleans within eight with twenty-six seconds remaining. On the subsequent kickoff, Graham's onside kick was bobbled by Seattle receiver Golden Tate at the Saints' 42-yard line, allowing Colston to recover for New Orleans, at the 41-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Brees found tight end Jimmy Graham for eight yards, then spiked the ball to stop the clock.\nOn the next play, Brees found Colston along the sideline at the Seattle 38-yard line. Instead of running out of bounds to stop the clock and give the Saints one more chance, Colston turned back toward the field of play and attempted to keep the play going by relaying the ball across the field to teammate Travaris Cadet. However, the throw by Colston to Cadet was forward – not a lateral – resulting in an illegal-forward-pass penalty which included a game-ending runoff, and the Seahawks won, 23–15. Brees finished the game with 309 passing yards and a touchdown. Colston caught 11 passes for 144 yards and a score. Bennett had six tackles, half a sack, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Saints and Seahawks, where Seattle won the last meeting 41–36 which is best remembered for Marshawn Lynch's \"Beast Quake\" run in the 2010 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nAFC: New England Patriots 43, Indianapolis Colts 22.\nNew England intercepted four passes, rushed for 234 yards, and scored six rushing touchdowns – the second highest total in postseason history – as they advanced to their eighth conference championship game in the last 13 years.\nThe Patriots took a 7–0 lead just 1:15 into the game after Alfonzo Dennard intercepted a pass from Colts quarterback Andrew Luck on the third play of the game and returned it 27 yards to the Indianapolis 2-yard line. On the next play, LeGarrette Blount ran the ball into the end zone for a score. Then after an Indianapolis punt, Tom Brady completed a 25-yard pass to Julian Edelman and a 16-yarder to Danny Amendola as the Patriots drove 74 yards to increase their lead to 14–0 on Blount's second 2-yard touchdown run of the first quarter. This time, the Colts managed to respond. Faced with third and 6 on their ensuing drive, Luck converted the down with a 22-yard pass to Griff Whalen, and then threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to receiver LaVon Brazill on the next play, cutting the score to 14–7.\nEarly in the second quarter, Edelman caught passes for gains of 27 and 13 yards as the team drove 75 yards to up the score to 21–7 with Blount's third 2-yard touchdown run of the half. Luck countered with a 29-yard completion to tight end Coby Fleener that set up Adam Vinatieri's 36-yard field goal. Then the Colts caught a break when a high snap sailed over the head of Patriots punter Ryan Allen. Allen recovered the ball on his own 1-yard line, but fumbled it while being tackled by Kelvin Sheppard. The ball went through the end zone for a safety, making the score 21–12. To make matters worse for New England, Allen was knocked out of the game on the play; kicker Stephen Gostkowski replaced Allen for the rest of the game. After the free kick, Indianapolis drove to the Patriots' 39-yard line, but linebacker Dont'a Hightower ended the drive by intercepting Luck with 1:14 left in the half.\nAfter the Patriots punted on the opening drive of the second half, Luck's completions to T. Y. Hilton and Fleener for gains of 40 and 16 yards set up Vinatieri's 21-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 21–15. But this was as close as they would get for the rest of the game. On the Patriots' ensuing drive, Brady's 53-yard completion to Amendola moved the ball to the Colts' 32-yard line, and they eventually scored on a 1-yard touchdown run by Stevan Ridley; he added a two-point conversion, increasing New England's lead to 29–15. Indianapolis struck back quickly with Luck completing a 46-yard pass to Hilton and a 37-yard touchdown pass to Brazill.\nHowever, the Patriots quickly dashed the Colts' comeback hopes early in the fourth quarter. With 13:08 left in the game, Blount broke through the line and took off for a 73-yard touchdown run, putting New England back up by 14 points at 36–22. Then New England linebacker Jamie Collins intercepted a pass from Luck and returned it 20 yards to the Colts' 18-yard line, and they scored another touchdown on a 1-yard rush by Ridley. Indianapolis was forced into a three-and-out on their next drive, enabling New England to get the ball back and run almost eight minutes off the clock, aided by Blount's 30-yard run. By the time the Colts got the ball back, only 2:34 remained. Then Dennard sealed the win by recording his second interception from Luck on Indianapolis' final play.\nBlount tied a franchise playoff record with 166 rushing yards, and set a franchise record with four rushing touchdowns. He also returned two kickoffs for 37 yards. Ridley rushed for 52 yards and two touchdowns, while Brady threw for 198 yards, making it the first time he did not throw nor score a touchdown in a playoff game since the 2001 AFC Championship Game. His top target was Edelman, who caught six passes for 84 yards. Luck threw for 331 yards and two touchdowns, but completed only 20 of 41 passes and was intercepted four times. Hilton caught four passes for 103 yards.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Colts and Patriots. The Patriots won two of the first three meetings, where the winner of each prior meeting won the Super Bowl. The Colts won the last meeting 38–34 in the 2006 AFC Championship Game.\nSunday, January 12, 2014.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 23, Carolina Panthers 10.\nSan Francisco recovered from a 10–6 first half deficit by intercepting Panthers quarterback Cam Newton twice, sacking him four times, while scoring 17 unanswered points to earn their third consecutive trip to the NFC Championship Game. With the win, the 49ers became the first team since the 1977 Minnesota Vikings to return to the NFC Championship Game after being defeated in the Super Bowl the previous year.\nA 23-yard completion from 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to rookie receiver Quinton Patton helped the team advance to the Panthers' 24-yard line on their opening drive. But on third down, Kaepernick was sacked for a 7-yard loss by linebacker Luke Kuechly, forcing the team to settle for Phil Dawson's 49-yard field goal. Then on Carolina's next drive, Newton was intercepted by linebacker Patrick Willis on the Panthers' 46-yard line, and the 49ers converted the turnover into another Dawson field goal to take a 6–0 lead. Carolina took the ball back and drove 65 yards to the 49ers' 1-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs when Newton was stopped short on the first play of the second quarter. But the Panthers' defense forced the 49ers to punt after three plays, and Ted Ginn Jr. returned the ball 24 yards to the San Francisco 31-yard line. On the next play, Newton completed a deep pass down the left side of the field for a 31-yard touchdown completion to receiver Steve Smith, giving the Panthers their first lead, 7–6.\nSan Francisco was forced to punt again on their ensuing possession, and Newton led the Panthers back for more points. After rushing twice for 17 yards, Newton's 35-yard completion to tight end Greg Olsen gave them a first down on the 49ers' 20-yard line. The drive stalled at the 7-yard line, where Graham Gano kicked a 24-yard field goal to give the team a 10–6 lead with 3:41 left in the half. But Kaepernick rallied the 49ers back, completing three passes to Anquan Boldin for 42 yards and a 20-yarder to Michael Crabtree. With just 14 seconds left, he finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis in the right corner of the end zone. Davis was ruled out of bounds when he made the catch, but a replay review showed he had both feet in bounds before stepping out and the call was overturned. With his touchdown, the teams went into their locker rooms at halftime with San Francisco leading 13–10.\nIn the second half, San Francisco completely took over; after Carolina punted on the opening drive, Kaepernick completed passes to Boldin for gains of 16 and 45 yards as the 49ers drove 77 yards and got into the end zone on Kaepernick's 4-yard run. Then after a long Panthers drive ended on the 49ers' 37-yard line with a punt, San Francisco running back Frank Gore's 39-yard burst set up a 34-yard field goal by Dawson, giving the 49ers a 23–10 lead with 7:35 left in the fourth quarter. Carolina responded with a drive to the San Francisco 28-yard line, but safety Donte Whitner intercepted a pass from Newton to prevent any scoring. After the turnover, the 49ers put the game away with a possession that ran the clock down to 12 seconds.\nKaepernick completed 15 of 28 passes for 196 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 15 yards and a score. Nearly all of his passing production came from Boldin, who caught eight passes for 136 yards. Gore added 84 rushing yards, while linebacker Ahmad Brooks had six tackles and 2.5 sacks. Willis had 11 tackles – five of which were solo tackles – and an interception. Newton finished his first playoff game 16-for-25 for 267 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. He also had 10 carries for 54 yards. Ginn caught four passes for 104 yards, returned two punts for 26 yards, and had 80 yards returning kickoffs.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the 49ers and Panthers.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 24, San Diego Chargers 17.\nDenver jumped out to a 17–0 lead and held off a late San Diego rally to prevail 24–17 and advance to their first AFC Championship Game since 2005, running the final four minutes off the clock with a 10-play drive that included three third down conversions.\nAfter San Diego punted on their first drive, Denver opened the scoring on their first possession with a 14-play, 86-yard drive in which Peyton Manning completed five passes to four different receivers, the last a 2-yard touchdown completion to Demaryius Thomas. Denver crossed into San Diego territory again on their second possession, but the Chargers got the ball back when rookie safety Jahleel Addae recovered a fumble from tight end Julius Thomas. They were unable to convert the turnover into points, however, when Nick Novak missed a 53-yard field goal attempt. Taking the ball back on their 43, Denver drove 57 yards, mainly on plays from running backs Knowshon Moreno and Montee Ball. Both of them rushed three times for 21 yards each on the drive, while Moreno caught a pass for 12. Manning finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker to put the Broncos up 14–0 with six minutes left in the second quarter.\nFollowing another Chargers punt, Broncos returner Eric Decker broke several tackles as he ran the ball back 47 yards, but tripped himself to the ground without being touched at the San Diego 30-yard line. The Broncos then drove to the 4-yard line; on third down, Manning threw a pass to Decker in the end zone, but linebacker Darrell Stuckey knocked the ball from Decker's grasp and Donald Butler managed to intercept it near the back of the goal line. It was the first red zone interception thrown by Manning all season. Denver kick returner Trindon Holliday ran the second half kickoff 37 yards to the 36-yard line, setting up a 47-yard drive that ended with Matt Prater's 45-yard field goal, increasing the team's lead to 17–0. On their next drive, the Broncos drove to the San Diego 29-yard line but this time Prater missed from 47 yards, his first miss of the season from under 50.\nThe Chargers finally got on the board in the fourth quarter, with Philip Rivers completing a 30-yard pass to Eddie Royal and then finding Keenan Allen for a 16-yard touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Holliday returned the kick 105 yards for a touchdown, but it was called back by an illegal block in the back penalty. Later in their drive, the Broncos were helped by a 23-yard pass interference call on Marcus Gilchrist on third down, and they eventually scored on Moreno's 3-yard run to take a 24–7 lead with just over eight minutes left in the game. On the next drive the Chargers faced a fourth and 5 from their own 25 and converted on a 49-yard pass to Allen. Three plays later Rivers found Allen again for a 16-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to 24–14. The Chargers then attempted an onside kick which bounced off Decker's hands and was recovered by Richard Marshall. Rivers completed 17 and 25-yard passes to Allen to get into the Denver red zone, but the drive stalled and the Chargers settled for a Novak 30-yard field goal. Taking possession with 3:53 remaining, Denver converted a third and 17 with a Manning 21-yard pass to Julius Thomas, then converted a third and 6 with a 9-yard pass to Thomas later in the drive. Shortly after the two-minute warning, Moreno converted a third and 1 with a 5-yard run, enabling Denver to run out the rest of the clock.\nManning finished 25-for-36 for 230 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Rivers finished with 217 yards and two touchdowns, 173 of which came in the fourth quarter. Allen finished with six receptions and 142 yards with two touchdowns, becoming the first rookie wide receiver since 1992 to have 100+ yards and two touchdowns in a playoff game. Moreno had 84 yards and a touchdown, along with a 12-yard reception, while Ball added 10 carries for 52 yards. It was the last playoff game for the Chargers before moving to Los Angeles in 2017.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Chargers and Broncos.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 19, 2014.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 26, New England Patriots 16.\nFor the first time since 2006, the Patriots played on the road in the playoffs, which was also the last time they faced Peyton Manning when he was with the Colts. But the story was all about Denver as their offense racked up 507 yards without turning the ball over or giving up any sacks as they advanced to their seventh Super Bowl in franchise history, avenging a Week 12 defeat in which the Patriots rallied from a 24–0 halftime deficit. Manning set a conference championship record with 32 completions for 400 yards and two touchdowns. The team also got a big performance from receiver Demaryius Thomas, who caught seven passes for 134 yards and a touchdown, and kicker Matt Prater, who made four field goals. The win was especially satisfying for head coach John Fox, who lost to Tom Brady and Bill Belichick in Super Bowl XXXVIII 10 years earlier when he was with the Carolina Panthers.\nMidway through the first quarter, Manning got the Broncos into scoring range with an 18-yard completion to Knowshon Moreno, a 29-yard pass to Thomas, and a 19-yarder to Eric Decker. Prater finished the drive with a 27-yard field goal to put the team up 3–0. The next time Denver had the ball, they advanced 93 yards in 15 plays on a drive that took up nearly half the second quarter. At one point they faced third and 10 from the Patriots' 39-yard line, and made the conversion with a 28-yard draw play by Moreno. Manning eventually got the team into the end zone with a 1-yard pass to tight end Jacob Tamme, making the score 10–0.\nThis time New England managed to respond, with Brady completing a 27-yard pass to receiver Aaron Dobson on the first play of their next drive; this ended up as Brady's longest completion of the game. The Patriots eventually reached the Broncos' 18-yard line, but Robert Ayers sacked Brady for an 11-yard loss on third down, forcing them to settle for Stephen Gostkowski's 47-yard field goal. Denver then took the ball back and drove for more points, as Manning hooked up with Thomas for a pair of completions that netted 53 yards. Prater finished things off with a 35-yard field goal, giving the team a 13–3 lead with 25 seconds left in the half.\nDenver started out the second half with a long touchdown drive that took up almost the same amount of time (7:08) as their last one (7:01), moving the ball 80 yards in 13 plays. Manning completed seven of eight passes for 59 yards on the drive, the last a 3-yard touchdown toss to Thomas that increased Denver's lead to 20–3. New England responded with a drive to the Broncos' 29-yard line, but on a fourth and 2 conversion attempt, Brady was sacked for a 10-yard loss by nose tackle Terrance Knighton. Denver then took over and set up a drive for more points, with Manning completing two passes to tight end Julius Thomas for 28 yards and a completion to Demaryius Thomas for 30. New England managed to halt the drive at their own 1, but Prater kicked his third field goal to put Denver up 23–3.\nNew England finally scored a touchdown with just over nine minutes left in the fourth quarter. Starting the drive with an 18-yard pass to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui, Brady followed it up with completions to Austin Collie and Julian Edelman for gains of 20 and 16 yards. He eventually completed the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Edelman, cutting the score to 23–10. However, Denver scored again with their next possession, with Manning's 37-yard completion to Julius Thomas setting up Prater's fourth field goal, this one from 54 yards.\nNew England now faced a 26–10 deficit with seven minutes left in regulation; Brady completed five of seven passes for 54 yards on their next drive, and took the ball into the end zone himself on a 5-yard run. However, their two-point conversion attempt failed, keeping the score 26–16. Then after Decker recovered New England's onside kick, Denver managed to run the final 3:07 off the clock with their last drive. Brady finished the day 24-for-38 for 277 yards and touchdown, along with two carries for seven yards and a score on the ground. Edelman caught 10 passes for 89 yards and a touchdown. Thomas had eight receptions for 85 yards for Denver, while Decker had five catches for 73.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Patriots and Broncos. Denver won two of the prior three meetings. New England won the last meeting 45–10 in the 2011 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 23, San Francisco 49ers 17.\nWith 22 seconds left in regulation, Richard Sherman deflected a pass in the end zone into the arms of linebacker Malcolm Smith for a game clinching interception as San Francisco was trying to drive for a winning score.\nThings got off to a rough start for the Seahawks as their quarterback Russell Wilson was sacked on the first play of the game by linebacker Aldon Smith, resulting in a fumble that was recovered on the Seattle 15-yard line. However, their defense managed to keep San Francisco out of the end zone, forcing them to settle for Phil Dawson's 25-yard field goal to take a 3–0 lead. There would be no more scoring until the second quarter, when 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took off for a 58-yard run that gave the team a first down on the Seattle 10-yard line. Three plays later on fourth and goal, running back Anthony Dixon dove over the goal line pile to score a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 10–0. This time, Seattle managed to respond with Wilson's 51-yard completion to Doug Baldwin leading to a 32-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka with just under six minutes left in the quarter. Near the end of the quarter, the 49ers appeared to have a chance to drive for points when Wilson threw an incomplete pass on fourth down from the 38-yard line with 20 seconds to go. Carlos Rogers was flagged for shoving receiver Golden Tate out of bounds after the incompletion, resulting in a penalty that pushed San Francisco back 15 yards and the team decided to run out the clock. Commentators Joe Buck and Troy Aikman both said they felt the penalty call was improper, as it appeared to be only a mild push.\nSan Francisco was forced to punt on their first drive of the second half, and Tate returned the ball 10 yards to his 40-yard line. Three plays later, Marshawn Lynch scored on a 40-yard touchdown run, tying the score 10–10. The 49ers struck back with Kaepernick completing a 22-yard pass to Michael Crabtree and then rushing for a 22-yard gain himself. Kaepernick fumbled the ball on the next play, but center Jonathan Goodwin recovered it and ran for a 6-yard gain. Kaepernick then finished the drive with a 26-yard scoring completion to Anquan Boldin, putting the 49ers back in front at 17–10. Baldwin returned the ensuing kickoff 69 yards to the 49ers' 33-yard line, setting up Hauschka's 40-yard field goal that made the score 17–13 with less than four minutes left in the third quarter.\nSeattle took their first lead of the game on the second play of the fourth quarter, 20–17, scoring on Wilson's 35-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Kearse on fourth down and 7. A series of fumbles and turnovers followed; first, Seattle defensive end Cliff Avril forced a fumble from Kaepernick, which was then recovered by Michael Bennett on the 49ers' 23-yard line. Seattle then drove to the 10-yard line, and on third down Wilson completed a pass to Kearse. But Kearse fumbled on the 1-yard line as he was going in for a score, while being tackled by linebacker NaVorro Bowman. Replays showed Bowman making a recovery and being touched down by contact, but the play did not end and the ball was pulled away from Bowman. Seattle fullback Michael Robinson ended up with the ball, allowing the Seahawks to maintain possession. The play was not reviewable, and to make matters worse for San Francisco, Bowman suffered a severe leg injury. Now with fourth and goal on the 1-yard line, Seattle coach Pete Carroll decided to go for the touchdown. But Lynch fumbled a handoff from Wilson and the 49ers ended up getting the ball back on the Seahawks 15-yard line. However, all they managed to do with this opportunity was give it back, as Kaepernick was intercepted by safety Kam Chancellor on the second play of their ensuing drive.\nNow with the ball on the San Francisco 40-yard line, Seattle drove to the 29-yard line where Hauschka kicked a field goal to give the team a 23–17 lead with 3:37 left in the game. San Francisco responded with a drive to the Seahawks' 18-yard line, featuring a 17-yard reception by running back Frank Gore on fourth down and 2. With 30 seconds remaining, Kaepernick attempted a pass to Crabtree in the corner of the end zone. Cornerback Richard Sherman made a leaping deflection of the pass to the lurking linebacker Malcolm Smith for an interception to seal the victory for the Seahawks.\nWilson completed 16 of 25 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown. Lynch rushed for 109 yards and a score. Baldwin had six catches for 106 yards, and added another 102 yards on three kickoff returns. Chancellor had 11 tackles – of which five were solo tackles – and an interception. Kaepernick finished the game 14-for-24 for 153 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions and a lost fumble, while also rushing for 130 yards on 11 carries. This was his second 100-yard rushing game in the postseason; only two other quarterbacks in NFL history up to this point ever had one. Bowman had 14 tackles – including six solo tackles – along with a sack, and a forced fumble. Both teams achieved the same number of total yards, with 308.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the 49ers and Seahawks.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII: Seattle Seahawks 43, Denver Broncos 8.\nThis was the second postseason meeting and first Super Bowl meeting between the Seahawks and Broncos. Seattle won the previous meeting as a member of the AFC 31–7 in the 1983 AFC Wild Card playoffs."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in India in 2012–13",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured India from 12 February to 26 March 2013, played a four-match Test series against India. During the 1st Test, Mahendra Singh Dhoni set the highest score by an Indian Test captain, scoring 224 runs, beating the previous record held by Sachin Tendulkar. India won the four Test series in a 4–0 whitewash to win the Border–Gavaskar Trophy. This was first time Australia lost a test series 4-0 after their defeat against South Africa in 1970.\nSquads.\nAustralia introduced two debutants, Moisés Henriques and Glenn Maxwell while India also introduced two debutants, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ajinkya Rahane.\nTest series (Border–Gavaskar Trophy).\n1st Test.\nIndia lost the toss and were asked to bowl on a pitch that will soon be a ripper for spinners. Aus got off to a quick start but started to struggle as spinners were introduced and lost 2 wickets before lunch. Post lunch it was Ashwin show completely as the off spinner picked 3 quick wickets. but resistance from Henriques and Clarke helped Aus reach 380.\nIndia had a poor start and lost openers quickly. However, MS Dhoni along with tail-ender Bhuvneshvar had a 9th wicket record partnership which took India's total to more than 500. In the second innings, the Indian spinners struck regularly, and except Henriques, no other Aussie showed any resistance, thus leaving India with a small target. Sachin Tendulkar finished the match by hitting two sixes off consecutive balls.\n2nd Test.\nIndia again lost the toss but this time the pacers extracted early movement which aided the spinners and resulted in low 1st innings total for Australia. Clarke and Wade had a useful partnership but the constant loss of wickets meant Clarke declared early. India, in their first innings, thanks to Pujara and Vijay for the partnership of 370 runs, scored 500+ again and the spinners in the 2nd innings dismissed Australia cheaply. This match marked the last test in the career of Virender Sehwag .\n3rd Test.\nThe first day was lost to rain, and thanks to Smith and Starc's batting, Australia got a healthy first innings total. India, however, with Dhawan's quickfire debut century and steady batting from Vijay, got a small lead. In the second innings, the Indian bowlers again dismissed the Australians for a low score and India won on the last day with less than 4 overs left.\n4th Test.\nClarke was ruled out due to Back injury and Watson was the captain. The spinners wreaked havoc in the match, and only Siddle from Australia and Pujara from India showed some resistance. Jadeja got his best bowling figures in Tests in the second innings and India won the test to record their first-ever whitewash against Australia.\nAustralian team disciplinary breach.\n\"Homeworkgate\" refers to a controversial sequence of events that took place during the 2013 tour of India.\nIncident.\nAustralia lost the first two Tests of the series, the second of them by a heavy margin: an innings and 135 runs. In this game, Australia became the first team in Test cricket to declare in its first innings, and then lose the match by an innings. With two Test matches left, the best Australia could hope for was a drawn series. Before the 3rd Test, four Australian players – Shane Watson, James Pattinson (both of whom had played in the 2nd Test), Mitchell Johnson and Usman Khawaja (who were in the touring party) – were made ineligible for the match following a breach of discipline. Michael Clarke, the captain, revealed that the extreme step had been taken as a result of repeated infractions. Former players reacted with astonishment at the harsh decision taken by the team management. Vice-captain Watson returned to the tour, after he flew back to Sydney after being dropped. The incident referred to an assignment given by head coach Mickey Arthur to the players requiring them to give in writing ways to improve their performance to help the team. The aforementioned players did not submit their replies within the time stipulated and combined with previous incidents of team breaches they were suspended for one test each."

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Abdul Qadir",
        "text": "Abdul Qadir was a Pakistani cricketer who took 17 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and fewer than 50 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A right-arm leg spin bowler who represented his country between 1977 and 1994, Yahoo! Cricket wrote that Abdul Qadir \"was a master of the leg-spin\" and \"mastered the googlies, the flippers, the leg-breaks and the topspins.\"\nAbdul Qadir made his Test debut in 1977 against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore. His first Test five-wicket haul came the following year against the same team in a match at the Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. In March 1984 against the English at the Gaddafi Stadium, he took a five-wicket haul in both innings of a Test match for the first time. He repeated this feat only once more in his career, at the National Stadium, Karachi, against the same team, in December 1987. His career-best figures for an innings were 9 wickets for 56 runs against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, in November 1987. In Tests, Qadir was most successful against the English taking eight of his five-wicket hauls against them. He took ten or more wickets in a match on five occasions. Qadir claimed 15 five-wicket hauls in his Test career, and Pakistan never lost any of the games on such instances.\nAbdul Qadir made his One Day International (ODI) debut during the 1983 Cricket World Cup against New Zealand at Edgbaston. His first ODI five-wicket haul came in June 1983, against Sri Lanka, a match which Pakistan won at the Headingley Cricket Ground in Leeds. He took 5 wickets for 44 runs in the match, which is his best performance in ODIs. Abdul Qadir took two five-wicket hauls in ODI cricket. , he is twenty-sixth overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers, a position he shares with Fred Trueman and Derek Underwood. He is fifth in the list of five-wicket haul takers for Pakistan, all formats of the game combined."

        "text": "Graham Gooch is a former cricketer who captained Essex and England. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches on twenty and eight occasions respectively, in an international career spanning nearly two decades. He is one of the most successful international batsmen of his generation; through a first-class career spanning from 1973 until 2000, he became the most prolific run scorer of all time with 67,057.&lt;ref name=\"Records / Combined First-class, List A and Twenty20 / Batting records / Most runs in career\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With 8,900 runs, Gooch was the leading Test run-scorer for England until overtaken by Alastair Cook in 2015. Gooch is one of 25 players in history to have scored over 100 first-class centuries. Having coached at Essex, he was full-time test batting coach for the England cricket team 2012–2014.\nFive years after Gooch's Test debut where he made a pair of ducks against Australia at Edgbaston in July 1975, he scored his first Test century with 123 against the West Indies at Lord's in June 1980. Gooch's highest Test score is 333, which he made in the first innings against India in 1990. As of August 2022, this is the third-highest Test score by an Englishman (after Len Hutton's 364 and Wally Hammond's 336 not out), and is the equal thirteenth-highest score in Test history. He went on to score 123 in the second innings of the same Test match, becoming the sixth Englishman at that time to have scored a century in both innings of a Test match, and the first for over 40 years. Gooch is one of fewer than 60 batsmen to carry his bat in a Test innings when, in 1991 against the West Indies, he remained not out at the end of the England innings with a score of 154. He is also one of only seven cricketers in Test history, and the only on a score of 100 or greater, to have been dismissed by handling the ball, when he flicked the ball away from the stumps against Australia in 1993.\nGooch scored 32 on his One Day International (ODI) debut, against the West Indies at Scarborough in August 1976. His first ODI century came in August 1980. Scoring 108, and making an opening partnership of 154 with Geoffrey Boycott, Gooch's innings led England to a 47-run victory over Australia at Edgbaston. Gooch's highest ODI score is 142 which he achieved against Pakistan in November 1987. As of August 2022, this is also the fifteenth-highest score by an Englishman in ODI history."

Open only to schools in Division III of the NCAA, a group of schools that are not allowed to award athletic scholarships, the championship was established in 2012. The tournament would be followed as the newest NCAA championship event by a single all-divisions championship in women's beach volleyball which began in 2016.\nHistory.\nThe idea of a Division III championship was first floated by several figures in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association in the late 1980s, but was long dormant because of NCAA participation rules—50 schools must sponsor a sport before a national championship tournament can be officially sanctioned. The main impetus for growth in Division III volleyball had been an unofficial D-III championship tournament known as the Molten Invitational, started in 1997. In 2010, the required number of programs was reached, leading to the creation of the D-III championship.\nFormat.\nThe Division III championship began in 2012 with nine teams and has steadily expanded with the growth of D-III men's volleyball. The most recent expansion came for the 2019 season, with the field going from 12 to 14 teams. This differs from the top-level NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship, which involved four teams through the 2013 tournament and expanded to six teams for 2014 and seven for 2018. Like the National Collegiate Championship, the Division III championship is a knockout tournament, with best-of-5-set matches. The current tournament format features six first-round matches, with the winners joining the top two seeds in the quarterfinals.\nThe tournament was not held in 2020 due to COVID-19, and with a significant number of schools opting out of competition in 2021 due to the still-ongoing pandemic, that year's field was reduced to 12 teams from the intended 14. \nResults.\n\"Source =\" "

The teams were originally scheduled to play three Tests but, the third Test became part of the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship.\nBackground.\nThe Pakistan team were to tour India after 12 years. It was reported in October 1998 that the tour would include three Tests and five One Day International (ODI) matches. The squad was scheduled to leave for India on 21 January 1999 with the opening Test starting on 3 February and the tour would wind up after the final ODI to be played on 15 March. It was later reported that the three Tests would be played in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai) and Bangalore, and the ODIs (now reduced to three) in Mohali, Cuttack and Kanpur.\nHowever, threat of disruption by certain militant groups in response to the alleged Pakistani involvement in insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir meant the tour lay in jeopardy. Security for the touring party was assured by India's Prime Minister. In January 1999, headquarters of the Board of Control for Cricket in India was vandalized and activists of the Shiv Sena party dug up the wicket at the first Test venue in New Delhi, causing the match to be moved to the southern city of Madras (now Chennai). Some activists also protested at the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi against the tour. However, the Pakistan squad arrived in New Delhi on 21 January after threats were withdrawn and India's Home Minister holding an emergency meeting. The number of Tests were reduced to two, and a third to be played as part of the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship, and the ODI series cancelled. Pakistan came to India on the back of a better Test record against India — seven wins against four losses in 44 matches.\nSquads.\nThe Pakistan squad for the tour was named on 14 January 1999. The 16-member squad excluded Aamer Sohail with the uncapped Wajahatullah Wasti added as his replacement. Two weeks prior, Wasim Akram had been appointed captain and Moin Khan his deputy. A 14-member India squad was named on 21 January. Two players from the squad that toured New Zealand, batsmen Navjot Singh Sidhu and Ajay Jadeja were dropped. All-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla and opening bat Sadagoppan Ramesh were included. Fast bowler Ajit Agarkar, nursing an injury, was left out for the first Test."

        "text": "Sir Garfield Sobers (also known as Gary or Garry Sobers) is a former international cricketer who represented the West Indies cricket team between 1954 and 1974. He scored centuries (100 or more runs in an innings) on 26 occasions. Widely acknowledged as the \"greatest all-rounder\", he was described by Australian cricketer Don Bradman as a \"five-in-one cricketer\". In 93 Tests, Sobers scored 8,032 runsat a batting average of 57.78and claimed 235 wickets. He held the record for most runs by a player in Test cricket until 1981. Sobers was named one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 1964, and one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Century in 2000. He entered into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame when the International Cricket Council (ICC) formally inducted him alongside 55 initial inductees in 2009.\nSobers made his Test debut against Pakistan in 1954. He scored his first century (365 not out) against the same team during the third Test of the 1957–58 home series. In the event, he became the youngest player to complete a triple century. Sobers' innings remained the highest individual score in Test cricket for 36 years until it was transcended by Brian Lara in 1994; the innings, however, remains the highest maiden century for a player in Tests. In the fourth Test of the same series, Sobers went on to score centuries in both the innings; he ended up scoring 824 runs at an average of 137.33 in the series. In terms of centuries scored, he was most successful against England (10 centuries). Sobers made scores of 150 or more in a Test match innings on thirteen occasions, and was dismissed five times between scores of 90 and 99. , he has the third-highest number of centuries for West Indies in Tests.\nSobers made his solitary One Day International (ODI) appearance in a match against England in September 1973; he was dismissed for a duck."

        "text": "Roger Federer's 2013 tennis season officially began on 14 January at the start of the 2013 Australian Open. This season saw Federer suffer a considerable decline in form, dropping five places to number 7 in the world, his lowest ranking in 11 years, and seeing his run of 36 consecutive grand slam quarterfinals ended by a second round defeat at Wimbledon. This year also marked the first time since 2002 where Federer did not reach a major final. His only title win of the season was a victory at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, an ATP 250 event.\nThe decline in form can be largely attributed to the severe back injuries Federer suffered for much of the season, hampering his play from March through October. He first injured his back in the early rounds of Indian Wells and then re-injured it in the quarterfinals of Hamburg.\nYear summary.\nAustralian Open and early hard court season.\nAustralian Open.\nFederer kicked off his 2013 season with an appearance at the Australian Open, where he finished in the semifinals last year. Federer began his campaign against Frenchman Benoît Paire in the first round, and swept him in straight sets. He defeated long-time rival Nikolay Davydenko in the second round in straight sets, and faced Australian Bernard Tomic in the third round. After Federer converted on a break point in the first game and held to win the set, Tomic attempted to level the game, saving six break points and bringing the second set to a tiebreak, in which he had an early lead, but Federer overcame the deficit and won the tiebreak. Federer then broke Tomic twice and gave up only one game in the third set, winning the match in under two hours. Federer defeated big serving Canadian Milos Raonic in the fourth round in straight sets, having not dropped neither a set nor a service game through the fourth round. With the win, he also extended his record of consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal appearances to 35, a run which extends back to the 2004 Wimbledon Championships. Federer faced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals, where he and Tsonga traded breaks in the first set and brought the set to a tiebreak, which he won. Tsonga took advantage of Federer's unforced errors in the second set, breaking his serve and holding to level out the match at one set all. The third set saw Federer and Tsonga again trading breaks and playing a tiebreak, which Federer won. Tsonga recovered from a triple break point in the fourth set, and broke Federer's serve and held the lead to bring the match to a fifth set, where Federer broke Tsonga and won the match after four match points and three and a half hours. With his win, Federer advanced to his tenth straight semifinal at the Australian Open. Federer played Andy Murray in the semifinals, and found himself down one set after Murray took advantage of Federer's poor first serves to break Federer's serve and hold for the lead. The second set went to a tiebreak, which Federer won after capitalizing on some mistakes from Murray. Murray then came back in the third set, and, with the help of two line calls that went in his favor, broke Federer and held to regain a one-set lead. Federer held an early lead in the fourth set after breaking Murray, but Murray broke back on an unforced error from Federer. Momentum then shifted in favor of Murray, who came close to winning the match, but Federer forced the set to go to a tiebreak, which he won. In the fifth set, Federer was unable to respond to aces and winners from Murray, giving up two break points and losing the match in four hours.\nRotterdam Open.\nFederer next played at the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam, entering as defending champion. He played Grega Žemlja of Slovenia in the first round, and blew past him, winning in straight sets in less than an hour. He next played wildcard Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands, and defeated him in straight sets in just over an hour. He played Frenchman Julien Benneteau in the quarterfinals, and found himself down one set after unforced errors led to his serve being broken. Federer then fought to secure the second set, but ultimately failed after missing a break point opportunity.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nFollowing the loss of his Rotterdam title, Federer next attempted to defend his title at the Dubai Tennis Championships in Dubai. He faced Tunisian wildcard Malek Jaziri in the first round, and dropped the first set after Jaziri secured his first and only break point in the match. Federer then took charge of the match, winning twelve of the next fourteen games to secure a win. In the second round, Federer played Marcel Granollers of Spain, and broke Granollers' serve once in each set en route to a straight-sets victory. Federer then played perennial rival Nikolay Davydenko in the third round, and flew past him in less than an hour to a second straight-sets victory. He lost to Tomáš Berdych in the semifinals in a close match, while blowing three match points in the second set tiebreak.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nAt the first Masters 1000 series event of the year, Federer once again entered as defending champion at Indian Wells. After receiving a bye in the first round, he faced Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan in the second round and defeated him in straight sets, completing the match in just under an hour. He played Croatian Ivan Dodig in the third round and advanced again in straight sets, dropping only four games en route to a victory in just over an hour. Federer next faced Swiss compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka. He won the match in three tight sets, nearly losing the match after Wawrinka broke in the third set. However, Federer held on to win the last set, and found perennial foe Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals. Federer, however, entered the match having suffered a back injury in the previous round and was defeated in straight sets. He then continued with his pre-planned decision to take a two-month break from the sport, skipping the mandatory Masters 1000 tournament in Miami under an exception from the ATP, which allows older players to relax their schedules, and the non-mandatory Masters 1000 tournament in Monte Carlo.\nSpring clay court season and French Open.\nMadrid Open.\nFederer next competed on clay at the Mutua Madrid Open, where he was the defending champion. Federer played Radek Štěpánek of the Czech Republic in the second round after a bye in the first round, and defeated him in straight sets. Federer then met Kei Nishikori of Japan in the third round. In the first set, Federer allowed Nishikori to convert on a break point opportunity, and Nishikori held the advantage to take the set. Federer came back in the second set, relying on strong shot-making to win five straight games and level the match at one set all. Federer's serve faltered in the third, and uncharacteristic errors from Federer, as well as strong play from Nishikori, meant that the Japanese number 1 defeated Federer for the first time in his career. This was Federer's earliest exit at the event since 2003, when the event was held as the Stuttgart Masters.\nItalian Open.\nFederer played at the Italian Open in Rome, where he finished in the semifinals the previous year. After a bye in the first round, Federer played Potito Starace in the second round, dropping only seven points on serve and breaking Starace four times en route to a victory in straight sets in 51 minutes. He faced Gilles Simon of France in the third round, and raced past Simon in similar style, winning in just over an hour after again dropping only three games. Federer played Jerzy Janowicz of Poland in the quarterfinals. In the first set, Federer and Janowicz traded games until Federer found a late break point, which he converted to take the set. Janowicz broke Federer in the first game of the second set and held to serve for the set, but Federer broke back and won the tiebreak to clinch the match. He played Benoît Paire of France in the semifinals. Paire held an early lead in the first before Federer broke back and won a tight tiebreak. Federer then broke early in the second set and held to win in straight sets. He played Rafael Nadal in his first final of the year, but fell short against a hot-handed Nadal, committing multiple unforced errors and having his serve broken five times en route to a loss in straight sets in just over an hour.\nFrench Open.\nFederer next competed at the French Open, where he finished in the semifinals the previous year. He played qualifier Pablo Carreño-Busta of Spain in the opening round, and won in straight sets, converting all seven of his break points to move into the second round, where he swept past qualifier Somdev Devvarman of India, dropping only five games en route to a victory in straight sets. He faced Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who had beaten him earlier in the year, in the third round. After a break of serve by Benneteau to start off the match, Federer rebounded and took the first set. Benneteau tried to make inroads on Federer's serve, but Federer continued to dominate, winning the next two sets to move to the fourth round, where he faced Frenchman Gilles Simon. Federer won the first set comfortably, but Simon began to fight back. Federer lost his rhythm after he fell on the baseline in the second set, and Simon capitalized to take the set and level the match at one set all. Simon took advantage of more unforced errors from Federer and won the third set, but Federer found his rhythm again and broke Simon's serve in the fourth, holding to level the match. Federer then secured an early break in the fifth and held to win the match, becoming the fourth person to have 900 wins on the ATP World Tour. He played Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals, where, after a decent start, Federer lost an early break advantage to Tsonga, and Tsonga broke again to take the first set. The next two sets saw Tsonga take a foothold on the match as numerous errors plagued Federer. Tsonga eventually won the match in straight sets.\nGrass court season and Wimbledon.\nHalle Open.\nFederer played at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, where he was the finalist last year. He played German wildcard Cedrik-Marcel Stebe in the second round. Though Federer struggled with his serve and made quite a few errors, including one in the first set which allowed Stebe to break his serve, Federer dominated most of the match and won in straight sets, marking his fortieth win at the Gerry Weber Open. He played German wildcard Mischa Zverev in the quarterfinals and swept past Zverev, not allowing him any games and breaking him a total of six times en route to a victory in forty minutes. Federer achieved his second double bagel of his career, his first since he double-bageled Gastón Gaudio at the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup. He then faced defending champion Tommy Haas in the semifinal. In a tight first set, Federer gave up a break point in the sixth game of the set, and Haas held the lead to win the set. The second set saw Federer win an early break point and level the match at one set all. Federer then broke Haas to love and held the lead to win the match. In the final, Federer played Russian Mikhail Youzhny. After wasted break point opportunities and unforced errors led to Youzhny edging Federer in the first set tiebreak, Federer improved his game and won the match to claim his first title of the season, tying John McEnroe for the third-most number of ATP titles won by a male player in the Open Era.\nWimbledon.\nFederer played at the Wimbledon Championships, where he was defending champion and vying to match Rafael Nadal's record of 8 titles at a single Grand Slam tournament, which Nadal had just achieved at the French Open two weeks earlier. Federer played Victor Hănescu of Romania in the first round, and dropped only five games en route to a straight-sets win in just over an hour. He played 116th-ranked Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine in the second round, and had a one-set lead before dropping the next three sets and losing the match, unable to hold leads and convert on crucial points. The loss ended Federer's record streak of 36 consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal appearances. This also marked his earliest loss at a Grand Slam tournament since the 2003 French Open, his first loss to a player ranked outside of the top 100 since losing to Richard Gasquet in 2005 (ranked 101st at the time). With Rafael Nadal's loss in the first round, this also was the first time ever that, when both of them were entered in a Grand Slam, that neither have made it to the second week. All of this, coupled with a slew of other player withdrawals, retirements, and upsets have led that day to be referred to as Black Wednesday.\nSummer clay court season.\nFederer added two outdoor clay events to his schedule before the US Open hard court season begins.\nGerman Open.\nFederer played at the German Open Tennis Championships in Hamburg as a wildcard. Federer won the title in Hamburg four times when it was an ATP Masters Series event, but did not play there since 2008, when he was a finalist. Federer announced before his first round match in Hamburg that he was changing his racquet for the second time in his career (the first change occurred in 2002 just prior to the tournament in Hamburg of that year), upgrading from a 90-inch frame to a 98-inch frame. His first match was against German Daniel Brands, and he earned his first victory with his new racquet, rallying against strong play by Brands after dropping the first set. He next played Jan Hájek of the Czech Republic, and defeated him in straight sets after wasting many break and match points. He played Florian Mayer in the quarterfinals, and dropped his first set against Mayer in a tough three-set victory. In the semifinals, he played qualifier Federico Delbonis of Argentina for the first time, but lost in straight set, failing to convert break and set points as Delbonis took advantage to win both set tiebreaks.\nSwiss Open.\nFederer next played at the Swiss Open. It was the first time Federer had participated in the Swiss Open since 2004. The tournament honored Federer's return by presenting him with a Swiss cow named Desiree. Despite the excitement over his return to the event, he was defeated in his opening match by Daniel Brands, his first opening-match loss since Rome in 2010. After the loss, Federer revealed that he had suffered a serious back injury several days before in Hamburg, and that he had taken anti-inflammatories and had been unable to practice.\nUS Open Series and US Open.\nCincinnati Masters.\nAfter withdrawing from the Rogers Cup, Federer played at the Western &amp; Southern Open in Cincinnati, where he was the champion last year. Following a first-round bye, Federer played German Philipp Kohlschreiber in the second round. After speeding through the opening set, Federer found some trouble against Kohlschreiber in the second set, but managed to convert his second match point during the set tiebreak, keeping his winning streak against Kohlschreiber alive with a straight sets win. He played Tommy Haas in the third round, and came close to losing after Haas held a one-set, one-break advantage. Federer rallied to force a third set and won the match in under two hours. Federer next played Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals. He broke Nadal late in the first set, playing fast and aggressive tennis with sharply angled, clean and powerful groundstrokes off both wings and frequent attacks at the net. He had opportunities to threaten Nadal on Nadal's serve in the second set, but this went awry, as Nadal continued to fight and as Federer began to rack up unforced errors. Federer's serve folded at the end of the second set and the start of the third, but he saved four match points on Nadal's serve before a wide forehand from Nadal on match point went unchallenged by Federer. Federer fell down the rankings again to No. 7, his lowest in over a decade.\nUS Open.\nAt the US Open in New York Federer played Slovenian Grega Žemlja in the first round, and won in straight sets after a lapse of concentration resulted in a drop of his serve in the third set. He next played Carlos Berlocq of Argentina in the second round, and swept him in straight sets, dropping only six games en route to a win in just over one and a half hours. He next played Adrian Mannarino in the third round, and won in similar fashion, holding his serve and dropping only five games in the match. In a surprise, Federer then lost to Tommy Robredo, a player he had beaten ten straight times, in straight sets in another error strewn display.\nAsian Swing.\nShanghai Masters.\nFederer's first post-US Open tournament was at the Shanghai Masters. He defeated Andreas Seppi in the second round in straight sets, but dropped his next match in the third round against Gaël Monfils in three sets. The loss marked only his second defeat against the Frenchman.\nEuropean Indoor Season.\nSwiss Indoors.\nFederer next played in the Swiss Indoors. He defeated Adrian Mannarino in the first round in straight sets, and then came back from a one-set deficit against Denis Istomin in under two hours. In the quarterfinal, Roger Federer faced Grigor Dimitrov, nicknamed \"Baby Federer\", for the first time. Dimitrov was defeated in straight sets, but Federer had to recover from a service break down and force a tie-break decision in the second set. In the semifinal round, Federer defeated Vasek Pospisil in a very tight three-setter. After winning the first set comfortably by breaking Pospisil's serve twice, Federer served for the match in the second set but squandered the opportunity. Then, Federer's serve was broken early in the deciding set, but he managed to return the service break and was able to serve for the match successfully at his second chance. Federer faced Juan Martín del Potro for the title, in a repeat of the previous year's final that saw del Potro emerge again victorious. He fell short again in another three-set battle against the Argentine. Despite the loss, the match saw Federer display significant improvement in form after a sluggish run to the final.\nParis Masters.\nFederer next played in Paris at the BNP Paribas Masters, knowing that he would qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals if he won his opening match against Kevin Anderson. With his win over Anderson, he became the sixth player to qualify (seventh if including the injured Andy Murray) for the Finals. He made it to the semifinals by subsequently beating Philipp Kohlschreiber and Juan Martín del Potro, the latter whom he faced less than a week earlier in the final in Basel. His win over del Potro was only his second of the season over a top-10 player, first since January, and only top-5 win thus far. Federer met Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for their 30th career meeting, where he ultimately lost in three sets.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nFederer entered the ATP World Tour Finals as the No. 6 seed and was drawn in group B with Novak Djokovic, Juan Martín del Potro, and Richard Gasquet. Before the tournament began, Federer received three ATP World Tour Awards: the Fans' Favourite Award for a record eleventh consecutive time, the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship award for a record ninth time, and the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award for a record-tying second time. Federer played his first round-robin match against Djokovic, only 3 days after their last match in Paris, and he again lost in three sets. Federer had not lost an opening match in the World Tour Finals since 2008. Federer then defeated Gasquet in straight sets. With Novak Djokovic having won the group just after two round-robin matches, Federer played his last round-robin match against del Potro. It was the third match between them in the last three weeks of the season. Federer won, but not without saving a breakpoint, and booked a place in the semifinals against Group A winner Rafael Nadal, who had won all his three round-robin matches and successfully clinched the No. 1 ranking for the 2013 season. Federer lost the semifinal match in straight sets, only managing to break Nadal's serve once in the first set. It was Federer's fourth consecutive defeat against Nadal in the 2013 season. At the end of the tournament, Federer overtook Tomas Berdych in the singles rankings and finished the season as world No. 6, his lowest since 2002.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nFederer's 2013 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nRoger Federer had a match win–loss record in the 2013 season. His record against players who were part of the ATP rankings Top Ten at the time of their meetings was . The following list is ordered by number of wins:"

The institution is located at Centro Sambil, in Valencia, the capital city of Carabobo State and the third largest city of Venezuela.\nThe museum offers visitors the origins and growth of baseball in the world and the history of what is known as the National sport of Venezuela. It also shows, through its exhibitions, the most prominent players who have made significant achievements, as well as efforts to honor people who have highlighted the activity of baseball in Venezuela, recognizing and appreciating their impact on national culture and exalt those who have made outstanding contributions to the sport.\nThe museum covers a total area of 2,300 square meters and is laid out on two levels. The first floor of the museum includes four historical rooms, an auditorium dedicated to Luis Aparicio, an art gallery named after Andrés Galarraga, a baseball library and a shop. On the second floor are a permanent Hall of Fame exhibition, two batting cages, and a newsroom.\nSince its opening in 2002, the museum created two nominating committees responsible for selecting the most notable baseball figures of all time. The Contemporary Committee, comprising representatives of the media, official scorekeepers, umpires, representatives of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, and Players Association officers, have the task of choosing both natives and foreign players who developed their careers in Venezuelan professional baseball through the 1980–2012 period. Meanwhile, the Historical Committee selects those players who made their careers in the period prior to the 1980–1981 season of the VPBL. In both cases, are also recognized those managers, executives, broadcasters and individuals who have collaborated in the development of baseball in Venezuela.\nMembers.\nNotes"

        "title": "2013 Victoria Azarenka tennis season",
        "text": "The 2013 Victoria Azarenka tennis season officially began at the 2013 Brisbane International, the first of two simultaneous events which opened the official 2013 season, and concluded with her fifth consecutive qualification for the 2013 WTA Tour Championships.\nYearly summary.\nAustralian Open series.\nAzarenka began her 2013 season as the top seed at the 2013 Brisbane International, her first participation at the event since winning in 2009. She defeated German Sabine Lisicki in the second round after receiving a bye in the first round. This was followed up with a crushing two set victory over Ksenia Pervak in the quarter-finals, to maintain her record of not dropping a set in the tournament thus far. Azarenka was later forced to withdraw from her scheduled semi-final against Serena Williams due to a toe injury.\nHer next tournament was the defence of her Australian Open title. Azarenka won her first six matches dropping only one set en route (against Jamie Hampton in the third round), to reach the final for the second consecutive year, where she faced Li Na of China. Azarenka was able to successfully defend her title with a three set victory in the final; thus, she became the first woman since Serena Williams in 2009–10 to successfully defend her Australian Open title. With the victory, she also became only the fifth active player (after Serena and Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova) to hold two or more Grand Slam singles titles.\nMiddle East series.\nAs the defending champion in Qatar, Azarenka once again reached the championship match, where she met Serena Williams, who replaced her as World No. 1 upon reaching the semi-finals (Williams did not play in Doha last year). After receiving a bye in the first round, she defeated Romina Oprandi, Christina McHale (without losing a game), Sara Errani and Agnieszka Radwańska to set up the final meeting against Williams. Azarenka scored just her second career victory over Williams, winning in the championship match in three sets and successfully defending her title.\nAzarenka missed the Dubai Tennis Championships for the second year in a row, withdrawing from the tournament due to a foot injury she sustained in Doha.\nAmerican hard court season.\nAzarenka's first tournament of the American hard court season was the defense of her Indian Wells title. As the top seed in the absence of Serena Williams, Azarenka got a first round bye, following which she defeated Daniela Hantuchová, Kirsten Flipkens (in three sets) and Urszula Radwańska, before withdrawing from the tournament prior to her quarter-final match against eventual runner-up Caroline Wozniacki due to an ankle injury. Her failure to defend her points saw her world ranking drop to No. 3 at the end of this tournament.\nThe ankle injury she suffered at Indian Wells forced her out of the Miami tournament the following week.\nClay court season.\nAzarenka decided to skip the Stuttgart event, to allow for recovery from her ankle injury. Her next tournament was the Mutua Madrid Open, where she was a finalist last year. She defeated recent Portugal Open champion Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in two tiebreak sets, in her first match since Indian Wells, before being upset in the second round by World No. 24 Ekaterina Makarova in three sets; thus losing her first match this season after eighteen matches undefeated.\nHer next tournament was Rome. After receiving a first round bye, she defeated Julia Görges, Ayumi Morita (who retired in the second set), Samantha Stosur and Sara Errani to reach the final, where she was defeated by Serena Williams in straight sets.\nAzarenka's next tournament was the French Open. She defeated Elena Vesnina, Annika Beck, Alizé Cornet, 2010 champion Francesca Schiavone and former doubles partner Maria Kirilenko to reach her first French Open semi-final, however, she was defeated there by 2012 champion Maria Sharapova in three sets.\nGrass court season.\nIn the first round of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships she defeated Maria João Koehler in straight sets, but suffered a knee injury early in the second set. This injury ultimately forced her to withdraw from the Championships before her second round match against Flavia Pennetta. Her withdrawal was among seven big-name casualties on the tournament's third day, which has also led to questions being raised about the surface of the grass. Her withdrawal also ended a streak of four consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals.\nUS Open series.\nFollowing her injury-enforced early exit from Wimbledon, Azarenka returned to action at the 2013 Southern California Open, where she was the top seed. After receiving a first round bye, she defeated Francesca Schiavone, Urszula Radwańska and Ana Ivanovic (the latter in three sets) before losing to Samantha Stosur in straight sets in the championship match. The loss to Stosur marked her first loss against her, after previously winning their first eight encounters.\nAzarenka was later forced to withdraw from the Rogers Cup due to a back injury she suffered in the championship match in Carlsbad.\nSeeded second at Cincinnati, Azarenka received a first round bye, following which she won her first match at the tournament since 2009, when she defeated local hope Vania King in the second round. That was then followed by wins over Magdaléna Rybáriková, Caroline Wozniacki (her first victory against her since 2009) and Jelena Janković, en route to reaching her fifth final of the year, where she defeated Serena Williams in a thrilling championship match to pick up her third title for the year.\nAt the US Open, where Azarenka was seeded second, she successfully reached the final for the second consecutive year, only dropping two sets en route. However, she lost in the final to Serena Williams in three sets. She was the only player to win a set against Williams over the last two years.\nAsian hard court season.\nFollowing the US Open, Azarenka began her Asian swing at the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, where she was the top seed. However, after receiving a first round bye, she lost in the second round to former number one and seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams in straight sets.\nAzarenka's next tournament was the China Open, where she was the defending champion. She lost in the first round to Andrea Petkovic in three sets, delivering 15 double faults and committing 44 unforced errors in the process.\nWTA Tour Championships.\nFollowing Azarenka's run to the US Open final, she qualified for the WTA Tour Championships for the fifth consecutive year. She was placed in the White Group along with Li Na, Sara Errani and Jelena Janković. She started off with a tight straight-sets victory over Errani, but then fell to Janković and Li in her remaining matches, thus failing to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2010 and spelling an end to her season.\nThe defeat to Li marked Azarenka's fifth loss in her past six matches, thus making for a poor end to her 2013 season. She ended the year ranked world number two, behind Serena Williams.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nVictoria Azarenka's 2013 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly Records.\nHead-to-head match-ups.\nBold indicates that the player was in the Top 10, \"italics\" denotes that the player was in the Top 20 (at the time of the match being played). This list is ordered by number of wins to number of losses in chronological order played.\nExhibition matches.\nVictoria Azarenka took part in the annual BNP Paribas Showdown, where she faced Serena Williams in a rematch of their 2012 US Open final. Azarenka lost the exhibition match in straight sets. At the end of the year Azarenka scored another victory on Williams, in an exhibition in Thailand. She won in straight sets."

        "title": "2013 Andy Murray tennis season",
        "text": "The 2013 Andy Murray tennis season officially began at the Brisbane International where he was the defending champion. He successfully defended that title, defeating Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets in the final. After a quarterfinal showing at Indian Wells, where he lost to Juan Martín del Potro in 3 sets, Murray recovered to win the Miami Masters for the second time, defeating David Ferrer in the final. Winning in Miami meant that Murray overtook Roger Federer as World No. 2, the first time Murray had held the ranking since September 2009, meaning that neither Federer nor Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top 2 for the first time since the end of 2003. During the summer Murray won his first Wimbledon title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final in straight sets to end Britain's 77-year wait for a home grown men's champion. It was Murray's second major title, and third consecutive title on grass, after winning at the Olympics the previous year, meaning he extended his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. In the summer hard court season, Murray failed to defend his US Open title, losing to Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarterfinals. Following the Davis Cup World Group play-offs, during which Murray won both his singles and the doubles rubber, he ended his season prematurely in order to undergo surgery on a long-standing back problem that had caused him trouble for over a year and a half. He ended the season ranked number 4 in the world, behind Nadal, Djokovic and Ferrer.\nYearly summary.\nAustralian Open series.\nBrisbane International.\nMurray began his season at the 2013 Brisbane International, where he was the top seed. He defeated Australian John Millman, Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan and Kei Nishikori of Japan (retired) en route to reaching the final for the second consecutive year. Here he faced Bulgarian young gun Grigor Dimitrov, who was competing in his first tour-level final. Despite being broken in the first set, Murray came back to dominate the tiebreak, winning 7 points in a row, then proceeding the second set by 6 games to 4, thus successfully defending his Brisbane title. The victory in Brisbane took Murray's career titles tally to 25, and at the trophy ceremony, Murray dedicated the victory to close friend and Davis Cup teammate Ross Hutchins, who at the time had just been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\nAustralian Open.\nMurray next competed at the 2013 Australian Open, where he was the No. 3 seed. He made light work of his first two matches, defeating Dutchman Robin Haase and Portugal's João Sousa respectively, each in straight sets, to set up a third round meeting with his practice partner Ričardas Berankis of Lithuania, who had qualified for the tournament the previous week. Despite having his service broken several times, Murray managed to defeat Berankis in straight sets. He next faced French 14th seed Gilles Simon in the fourth round, winning in straight sets and subsequently advancing to the quarter-finals for the ninth straight Grand Slam tournament, and without dropping a set. In the semifinals, Murray met Roger Federer in their first Grand Slam semifinal and fourth Grand Slam meeting overall, their previous three meetings all having come in finals. After exchanging sets over the first four, including Federer taking the second and fourth each in tiebreaks, Murray eventually prevailed in five sets to set up a second consecutive final against Novak Djokovic. In beating Federer, Murray also matched Fred Perry's Grand Slam match win total of 106. In the final against Djokovic, Murray took the first set in a tiebreak, but ultimately lost in four sets, an untimely double fault in the second set proving fatal.\nSpring American hardcourt season.\nIndian Wells.\nFollowing his final defeat in Melbourne, Murray took a six-week break in order to train for the first two Masters 1000 series tournaments of the year. He entered the 2013 BNP Paribas Open having not won a match since 2010, when he reached the quarterfinals, so had minimum points to defend. After receiving a bye into round two, the Scot faced Russian Evgeny Donskoy, the first meeting between the two. Murray dropped the first set in the 12th game, however then went on to win the next two sets for the loss of just 4 games. He won both of his next two matches in straight sets, against Chinese Taipei's Yen-hsun Lu and Argentine Carlos Berlocq respectively to set up a quarterfinal clash with Juan Martín del Potro. Despite holding a strong advantage in their head-to-head, having won 5 out of 6 meetings, Murray wasn't able to capitalise on winning the opening set in a tiebreaker, losing in three sets to the eventual finalist.\nMiami Masters.\nFollowing his defeat in Indian Wells, Murray returned to Miami for the Sony Open Tennis tournament. Murray faced two potentially tricky opponents in young up-and-comers Bernard Tomic of Australia, and Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov respectively, however overcame both in straight sets. He backed this up with an 84-minute victory over Italian Andreas Seppi, making it to his fourth straight quarterfinal of the year, where he faced Marin Čilić of Croatia. Despite a considerable number of lengthy games and rallies, including nine breaks of serve, one game that lasted over 15 minutes, and seven match points, Murray triumphed in just over an hour and a half in straight sets, to reach the semifinals of the Miami Masters for the fourth time. In the semifinals, Murray faced Frenchman Richard Gasquet, who had beaten fourth seed Tomáš Berdych in the last 8. Murray lost the first set in a tiebreak, despite serving for the set at 5–4, before taking the second and third sets for the loss of just three games. In the final Murray faced Spaniard David Ferrer, the second time the two have met in a final at a Masters 1000 tournament. After losing the first five games of the match, Murray eventually won in three sets, after saving a match point at 6–5 down on serve in the final set, following which he dominated the tiebreak to win his second Miami title, and 9th masters 1000 title overall. Following this victory, Murray moved up to No. 2 in the world rankings for the first time since September 2009, thus marking the first time in almost ten years in which neither Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal was ranked inside the top two.\nEuropean clay court season.\nFollowing a two-week break, Murray headed to Monaco for the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, where Spaniard Rafael Nadal was 8-time defending champion. After receiving a bye into the second round, Murray won his opening match against qualifier Édouard Roger-Vasselin of France in straight sets, before being defeated by Swiss number 2 Stanislas Wawrinka, who had previously won both of their previous meetings on clay. Due to this, Murray dropped to World No. 3 in the week starting 22 April 2013.\nAt the Mutua Madrid Open, Murray faced Florian Mayer of Germany in the second round, after a first round bye. Despite facing several set points, the Scot overcame the German number 3 in straight sets to record his 400th career win. He faced Frenchman Gilles Simon in round three, and needed three hours, three sets and 6 match points to record his 11th straight victory over Simon, and reach his first clay court quarterfinal of the year. He will next play against the 2012 runner-up Tomáš Berdych, whom Murray has defeated three times in their past four meetings, however has yet to record a victory over the Czech on clay. Murray will also return to the number 2 ranking after the tournaments conclusion, following a defeat of Roger Federer by Japanese rising star Kei Nishikori in the third round. In the quarter-finals, Murray lost to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets. At the Rome Masters, Murray recovered from a set and a double break down against Marcel Granollers to level the match in a tie-break, only to retire before the start of the third set, citing a back injury. This was the first time Murray had retired mid-match since Hamburg in 2007, when he withdrew from his match against Filippo Volandri during the first set, despite being a double break up.\nThe back injury he suffered in Rome ultimately forced him to withdraw from the French Open, making this the first Grand Slam tournament since Wimbledon in 2007 that he has missed due to injury. Despite aiming to improve his clay court results, Murray only managed to gain 10 points more than 2012 in the lead up to the French Open, as over-preparation ultimately lead to him aggravating a recurring back injury.\nGrass court season.\nQueen's Club Championships.\nMurray entered the grass court season having won 12 of his previous 13 matches on grass, spanning back to last year's Wimbledon, and having not lost since the final. His first tournament after missing the French Open was at the Queen's Club Championships, where he was the top seed. After receiving a first round bye, Murray's first match in the second round pitted him against Nicolas Mahut, who had knocked him out at the same stage the previous year. Despite not having competed for a month, Murray overcame Mahut in straight sets, which he followed up with straight sets wins over Marinko Matosevic and Benjamin Becker respectively. His first match against a top 10 opponent came in the form of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, whom Murray had defeated in the final two years previously. He overcame a slow start that saw him lose the first set to win in three, and set up a clash with 5th seed and defending champion Marin Čilić. Once again Murray had to recover from a set down, and went on to defeat Čilić in three sets to win his third Queen's title, becoming the first British man since Arthur Gore to win the tournament three times. The final was followed by a charity doubles match with Tim Henman, fellow top 10 player Tomáš Berdych and former world no. 1 and Murray's coach Ivan Lendl. The match was organised to raise money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, after Murray's Davis Cup teammate and close friend Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma in December 2012.\nWimbledon.\nAt Wimbledon, Murray made it through his first three matches without losing a set, his first round match, in which he defeated German Benjamin Becker, whom he had defeated at Queen's Club just weeks earlier, took Murray's Grand Slam match wins total to 107, surpassing Fred Perry's total, making Murray the British player with most all time match wins at Grand Slam tournaments. Murray then beat Lu Yen-hsun of Chinese Taipei in round two, and Spanish 32nd seed Tommy Robredo in the third, against whom Murray hadn't played since 2009. In the fourth round match Murray beat Russian Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets despite going 5-2 down in the second set (which, like the previous round, was also the first meeting between the two since 2009). In the quarterfinals, Murray met left-hander Fernando Verdasco of Spain, who had beaten Murray in their previous Grand Slam meeting. Verdasco won the first two sets, before Murray raised his level of play considerably, eventually coming through to win in five sets and reach his fifth consecutive Wimbledon semifinal, tying him with John McEnroe in fourth place for most consecutive semifinals at Wimbledon behind Roger Federer, Jimmy Connors and Björn Borg. Murray faced Jerzy Janowicz of Poland in the semifinals, against whom Murray lost in the 2012 Paris Masters. Despite dropping the opening set in a tiebreak, the Scot eventually prevailed in four to set up a fourth Grand Slam final against Novak Djokovic, the second meeting between the two at SW19, and the first at the Championships. Murray defeated Djokovic in straight sets (6-4, 7–5, 6–4) to become the first British man to win Wimbledon since 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since 1896, as well as becoming the 7th man in the open era to complete the Queen's/Wimbledon double. With the win, Murray extended his winning streak on grass to 18 matches, his previous loss coming at the 2012 Wimbledon Final.\nUS Open Series.\nRogers Cup.\nFollowing a break of around 4 weeks, Murray's next tournament was the Canada Masters held in Montreal. He was aiming to win his third title at the event, second masters 1000 title of the year and 10th masters series title of his career. His first opponent was Spaniard Marcel Granollers, who had won the title in Kitzbühel, whom Murray defeated in straight sets to set up a clash with Ernest Gulbis of Latvia. Despite having lost all 5 of their previous meetings, Gulbis took advantage of Murray's lack of competitive play and defeated the Scot in straight sets, his first loss since he retired at the Rome Masters in May.\nIn the doubles competition, Murray partnered fellow Scot Colin Fleming, due to the absence of Jonathan Marray from the draw. The pair opened with a victory over Frenchman Julien Benneteau and former world no. 1 Nenad Zimonjić of Serbia. They then went on to defeat three seeded teams, including two former world no. 1's. The pair defeated 2012 Australian Open champions Leander Paes and Radek Štěpánek, fourth seeds Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi &amp; Jean-Julien Rojer, and 8 time Grand Slam champion Daniel Nestor &amp; three-time Wimbledon finalist Robert Lindstedt to reach their first doubles final at a Masters 1000 tournament. In the final they faced third seeds Alexander Peya &amp; Bruno Soares, however were defeated in straight sets, despite holding two set points in the second set. As a result of his run to the final, Murray will return to the top-100 in doubles for the first time since 2011.\nWestern &amp; Southern Open.\nMurray opened his bid for a third Cincinnati title with two strong wins, defeating Russian Mikhail Youzhny and Julien Benneteau of France each in straight sets, for the loss of just 9 games between them. He then went on to meet Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals, however was unable to maintain his level of play against the Czech and went out in straight sets, the second time in a row Murray had lost to Berdych without winning a set.\nUS Open.\nMurray dropped to number 3 in the rankings prior to the US Open, meaning he would potentially have to face both Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in order to defend his title. He was made to wait until the third day of play to begin his title defence, however opened strongly with a straight sets win over Frenchman Michaël Llodra. The next round proved slightly tougher, as Argentine Leonardo Mayer took him to four sets. His next match was against German Florian Mayer, whom he defeated in straight sets, winning the last two comfortably after being taken to a tiebreaker in the first. He faced Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan in the fourth round, who also took Murray to four sets, taking the first in a tiebreak before Murray upped his level and won the next three comfortably to set up a quarterfinal clash with ninth seed Stanislas Wawrinka. In what was anticipated as a tough match, Wawrinka controlled the match throughout, sending a below par Murray out in straight sets. Murray shortly after flew to Croatia to begin preparations for the Davis Cup World Group play-offs on clay.\nIndoor Season.\nAfter a disappointing American hardcourt season, Murray took the decision to undergo surgery on his lower back, in the hope of fixing a disc problem that had caused him pain since early 2012. Whilst problems in his lower back seemingly subsided since Wimbledon 2012, Murray revealed that it flared up again during the clay court season, and also caused him discomfort during the US Open Series. As a result, he stated that he would definitely miss the Asian swing of tournaments, pulling out of events in Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai, and subsequently from the Paris Masters and the World Tour Finals. It was announced that it was likely he would return to action at the beginning of the 2014 season at the Australian Open.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Murray in 2013, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins. They are marked ND for non-decision or no decision.\nYearly Records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\""

The remaining two teams then played each other (in Game 6), to determine seeding for the semifinals of the championship round.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPool 2 MVP: Robinson Canó\nResults.\nPuerto Rico 4, Italy 3.\nItaly's early lead in the 5th inning has caused team Puerto Rico to bring themselves closer to elimination until they have managed to ultimately steal the lead from the Italians when the Puerto Rican scored three additional runs from the eighth inning, as the Italian teams struggle to get ahead, only to end up earning themselves two more errors, as Puerto Rico clinched their win over Italy.\nDominican Republic 3, United States 1.\nTournament RBI leader and American leader David Wright sat the game out with a sore back. The game was close all the way to the 9th inning. American closer Craig Kimbrel came in for the 9th inning of the 1−1 game, to try to keep the score tied. Immediately Kimbrel gave up a lead-off double to Nelson Cruz, despite not giving up one all year with the Atlanta Braves in . Erick Aybar drove Cruz in and would later score himself, on a single by José Reyes, as the Dominican Republic would maintain their undefeated record.\nMLB Network announcer Tom Verducci, on seeing the jubilant reaction of the Dominican players after they took the lead in the game, said \"this is beyond October.\"\nPuerto Rico 4, United States 3.\nThe US team (with David Wright unable to play) and the Puerto Rico team played a second time. Puerto Rico took an early lead in the first inning and stretched the lead further in the sixth inning 4-0. The US struggled to catch up, but J.C. Romero barely managed to stave off from the bases-loaded jam in the eighth inning. The Puerto Rico team defeated the US team, 4-3, so that Puerto Rico qualified as the pool's second team in the championship round, and earning their payback from a 6-5 loss in the 2009 World Baseball Classic."

        "text": "The championship round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic was held at AT&amp;T Park, San Francisco, California, United States from March 17 to 19, 2013.\nThe championship round was a single-elimination tournament. In the final (championship) game, the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the tournament were to be the home team. If the teams competing in the final had identical winning percentages in the tournament, then World Baseball Classic, Inc. (WBCI) would conduct a coin flip or draw to determine the home team.\nThe Dominican Republic defeated the Netherlands and Puerto Rico to win their first World Baseball Classic championship. Robinson Canó was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nResults.\nSemifinal 1 − Puerto Rico 3, Japan 1.\nTwo time World Baseball Classic defending champions Japan faces off against surprising upstart Puerto Rico in the first semi-final matchup. Puerto Rico scores a run from the first inning and scored two additional runs from a home run by Alex Ríos as the Japanese team struggle to catch up. Japan, however, only managed to score at least a run; Seiichi Uchikawa made a baserun snafu in an effort to steal second but was caught up between first and second bases as catcher Yadier Molina tags Uchikawa for a second out. Despite the efforts, Japan eventually loses to Puerto Rico 3-1 as their championship streak from two previous World Baseball Classic games has ended and the Japanese team gracefully bows out to the stands and the Puerto Rican baseball team after their defeat.\nFinal − Dominican Republic 3, Puerto Rico 0.\nIn the final, Samuel Deduno started for the Dominican Republic, while Giancarlo Alvarado started for Puerto Rico. 35,703 fans attended the game at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. An additional 50,000 Dominican fans watched the game at Estadio Quisqueya in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, the final was the most watched sporting event for the past year with nearly three-fourths of all households tuning in.\nEdwin Encarnación hit a two-run double in the first inning, giving the Dominican Republic the lead. Erick Aybar had the game's third run batted in for the Dominican Republic. Deduno recorded five strikeouts in five scoreless innings pitched and Fernando Rodney completed the game with a save, his seventh save of the tournament. Four Dominican relief pitchers combined for 4 scoreless innings.\nThis was the third time in the tournament that the Dominican Republic defeated Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic completed the tournament with an 8–0 record, becoming the first undefeated team to win the World Baseball Classic. Robinson Canó was named the Most Valuable Player of the Classic after he batted 15-for-32 (.469), the most hits in tournament history. After the match the team was congratulated immediately for their victory by Dominican president Danilo Medina."

        "title": "2005–06 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2005–06 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team was an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big East Conference, representing Georgetown University. The team raced out to an 11–4 record including an 8–2 mark in out of conference play. John Thompson III's first notable win with the team took place on January 21, 2006, in the 16th game of the season when unranked Georgetown upset No. 1 Duke University. This was Georgetown's first win over a No. 1 ranked team in 21 years. The team received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and advanced to the Minneapolis Region Semifinal in the \"Sweet Sixteen\", where it came the closest of any team to beating the eventual national champion, Florida.\nThe team was ranked No. 23 in final Associated Press Poll of the season and No. 16 in the postseason Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nRegular season.\nSophomore forward Jeff Green led the team in scoring, shooting 44.5 percent from the field and averaging 11.9 points per game, was second in rebounding, with 6.5 per game, and led the team in assists, with 3.27 per game. At Vanderbilt, he scored 14 points and had season highs with nine rebounds and four blocked shots. At 11th-ranked Illinois, he got off to a slow start with only one point in the first half, but then put in a 20-point performance in the second half for a season-high 21 points. He led the team in scoring at 16th-ranked West Virginia with 17 points, also tying his season high with nine rebounds during the game. He scored 13 points and had eight rebounds at fourth-ranked Connecticut, and in an upset of top-ranked Duke he scored 18 points, tied his career high with seven assists, and had three steals. In a double-overtime win at Notre Dame, he played a career-high 46 minutes, during which he scored 12 points and had seven rebounds and six assists. He had a 20-point, seven-rebound, five-assist performance against Cincinnati and scored 15 points and had seven rebounds at DePaul. In a game with Pittsburgh at the MCI Center, he shot 9-got-14 (64.3%) from the field and tied his career high with 22 points. In a rematch with now ninth-ranked West Virginia at the MCI Center, he had his first double-double of the season, scoring 21 points and collecting 10 rebounds, and at fourth-ranked Villanova he scored 15 points, grabbed six rebounds, and had a game-high six assists. He shot a season-high 8-for-12 (66.7%) from the free-throw and led the team in scoring with 18 points in the victory over Syracuse, also collecting seven rebounds and making four assists. He ended the regular season with 10 points at South Florida.\nSophomore center Roy Hibbert was second on the team in scoring, shooting 59.0 percent from the field and averaging 11.6 points per game, and he led the team in rebounds with 6.9 per game and in blocked shots with 54 blocks, an average of 1.64 per game. He opened the season with a team-leading 20-point performance against Navy in a game in which he also grabbed seven rebounds and blocked four shots. Three days later, he followed up with a 23-point game against James Madison. In an early-season win at Oregon, he shot 6-for-6 from the free-throw line and scored 16 points. Against Stetson two weeks later, he saw a 25-for-25 free-throw shooting streak end, but he also had his second double-double of the season with 17 points and 10 rebounds. He had a double-double again in his next game, with 16 points and 11 rebounds against Savannah State. As the Big East season started at the beginning of 2006, he had his fourth double-double, scoring 16 points and pulling down 10 rebounds against Providence. He scored 16 points again six days later at 16th-ranked West Virginia, and followed that up with 12 points at fourth-ranked Connecticut, shooting 6-for-9 (66.7%) from the field against the Huskies. He had his fifth double-double in the double-overtime win against Notre Dame, scoring 18 points and grabbing 13 rebounds, and in a win over Cincinnati he scored eight points and had seven rebounds. At DePaul, he shot 7-for-9 (77.8%) from the field, scored 17 points and led the team with eight rebounds, and in a win over St. John's he put in a 14-point, eight-rebound performance. In the rematch with ninth-ranked West Virginia at the MCI Center, Hibbert had a season-high four assists. He led the team with 17 points and grabbed eight rebounds at Marquette, had his sixth double-double of the season with 20 points and 12 rebounds at fourth-ranked Villanova, and in a win over Rutgers shot 10-for-13 (76.9%) from the field, scored a career-high 25 points, and had eight rebounds.\nSophomore guard Jonathan Wallace shot 45.7 percent from the field and 42.7 percent from three-point range, scored in double digits 14 times, averaged 8.4 points per game, and led the team in assists with 3.23 per game. His first double-digit scoring performance of the year was against James Madison, when he scored 12 points, and he scored 11 points against Vanderbilt. Against Fairfield he also scored 11 points, and he tied what was then a career-high with six assists. He scored 10 points and had three assists against Savannah State, and against a tough Miners team at Texas-El Paso in the championship game of the Sun Bowl Tournament he scored 13 points, with four rebounds and four assists. He scored a season-high 15 points in the Big East season opener against Providence, and six days later at 16th-ranked West Virginia he scored 12 points, pulled down a season-high five rebounds, and had four assists. In the upset of No. 1 Duke, he scored 12 points and again tied his personal record of six assists. He scored 10 points against Cincinnati, and against Rutgers he again tied his career high with six assists, pulled down a career-best six rebounds, and again scored 10 points. He also scored 10 points both against Syracuse and at South Florida.\nSenior forward Brandon Bowman started all 33 games – competing his string of starting all 127 games of his collegiate career. He shot 44.9 percent from the field for the year and 52.6 percent from two-point range, but only 28.6 percent from beyond the three-point arc. In the first four Big East games of the season, he averaged 15 points per game, but then began to exhibit the inconsistency that had plagued him through his tenure at Georgetown, shooting only 2-for-6 (33.3%) from the field against South Florida in the fifth conference game. He had perhaps the best game of his career in the upset of Duke, playing excellent defense, shooting 8-for-12 (66.7%) from the field, scoring 23 points, grabbing seven rebounds, and blocking three shots. He scored five of the Hoyas' last six points to put the Hoyas over the top and secure the upset, and he hit two crucial free throws with 29 seconds left to play that forced Duke to attempt three-pointers for the remainder of the game. Unfortunately, in the Hoyas next game, against Notre Dame, Bowman fouled senior Notre Dame guard Chris Quinn with Georgetown leading by four points as Quinn shot and made a three-pointer; Quinn made the resulting free-throw to complete a four-point play that tied the game and forced overtime, and the Hoyas had to play a second overtime before eking out an 85–82 win. Bowman faltered over the remainder of the regular season, although he did have a double-double against ninth-ranked West Virginia with 15 points and 11 rebounds.\nSenior guard and team co-captain Ashanti Cook started all 33 games, the third straight season he had started every game. Early in the season in the win at Oregon, he shot 8-for-10 (80.0%) from the field, mostly from long range, and scored a career-high 25 points. In Georgetowns upset of No. 1-ranked Duke, he scored 17 points before a leg cramp forced him to leave the game, and three days later he scored 15 at Notre Dame. After a 4-for-24 (16.7%) shooting slump during the middle of the season, he regained his form; in his last seven games, he shot 58 percent from the field, 52 percent in three-point shots, and 78 percent in free throws, and he averaged only two turnovers per game.\nForward and team co-captain Darrel Owens had sat out his freshman year in 2001-02 and opted to use his remaining year of collegiate eligibility by returning for a fifth year at Georgetown this season. No longer a starter, he appeared in all 32 games this season as a reserve in a key \"sixth man\" role. At Texas-El Paso, he shot 5-for-5 from three-point range and scored 21 points as Georgetown beat the Miners on their home court to win the Sun Bowl Tournament. Eleven days later at Madison Square Garden, he scored 24 points against St. John's, then continued his hot shooting with 20 points against South Florida at the MCI Center. In the upset of Duke four days later, he missed his first shot but then went 6-for-7 (85.7%) from the field. Four days after that, he had an 18-point performance at Notre Dame. His offensive numbers declined for much of the rest of the season, but would improve in the postseason.\nFreshman guard Jessie Sapp joined the team this season and appeared in all 33 games, averaging 16.0 minutes per game. He scored a season-high 11 points against Savannah State, and in Big East play had a season high of eight points against Rutgers.\nThe Hoyas won the Sun Bowl Tournament in late December 2005 and started the season 10–2, with one of their losses coming on the road against No. 11 Illinois. After two losses to ranked Big East opponents (No. 16 West Virginia and No. 4 Connecticut), they ran off seven straight wins – including upsets of No. 1 Duke and No. 9 Pittsburgh – to push their record to 17–4, and in late January 2006 Georgetown climbed into the national rankings for the first time since early January 2002, remaining a ranked team through the end of the season. The Hoyas faltered down the stretch, losing four of their last six regular-season games, but two of the losses came to ranked opponents (No. 9 West Virginia and No. 4 Villanova). They finished the regular season tied for third place in the Big East, with a 10–6 record in the conference and 19-8 overall.\nAn unusual footnote to the season occurred on February 25, 2006, when a candidate for student government at The George Washington University led a group of George Washington students estimated at between six and 15 people on a walk from George Washington's main campus in Washington, D.C.'s Foggy Bottom neighborhood to the Georgetown campus away to protest Georgetown's refusal to schedule the Colonials for a regular-season game since December 1981 and to demand a game between the schools. The George Washington students arrived at Georgetown to find the campus virtually deserted because of the Georgetown-Syracuse game, then underway at the Verizon Center across town. The protesters quietly dispersed.\nBig East tournament.\nSeeded fifth in the 2006 Big East tournament, Georgetown defeated 12th-seeded Notre Dame in the first round, with Bowman recovering from his late-season slump to score 25 points, Wallace putting in an eight-point, six-rebound, four-assist performance, and Green scoring 13 points and pulling down nine rebounds. Hibbert scored only four points but had 11 rebounds and four assists. In the quarterfinals, Green led the team with 16 points, nine rebounds, and five assists and Bowman scored 11 as the Hoyas upset fourth-seeded Marquette. Sapp scored only two points but grabbed a career-high seven rebounds in the game. Georgetown faced its archrival, ninth-seeded and 16th-ranked Syracuse, in the semifinals. Wallace had 10 points and tied his season high with six assists, Green also scored 10 points and had seven rebounds, and Hibbert had a nine-point, 13-rebound performance, but Ashanti Cook lost the ball twice in the final seconds of a close game and Syracuse prevailed 58–57 to knock the Hoyas out of the tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nBoasting a 21–9 record and two wins against ranked teams, Georgetown received an invitation to the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 2000-01 team appeared in the 2001 tournament and only the second time since the 1996-97 team played in the 1997 tournament. Seeded seventh in the Minneapolis Region in the 2006 tournament, the Hoyas faced Northern Iowa in the first round. Hibbert led the team with 17 points and nine rebounds and Ashanti Cook hit crucial free throws as Georgetown won. In the second round, Georgetown upset the regions No. 2 seed, sixth-ranked Ohio State, with Green scoring 19 points, collecting eight rebounds, and dealing out six assists, Hibbert posting his seventh double-double of the year with 20 points, 14 rebounds, and three blocked shots, Darrel Owens scoring 13 points, and Cook playing 37 minutes in which he shot 7-for-11 (63.6%) from the field, scored 17 points, grabbed five rebounds, dished out five assists, and committed only one turnover. Georgetowns season came to an end in the Minneapolis Region semifinals against the regions No. 3 seed and eventual national champion, 11th-ranked Florida. Green put in a 15-point, six-rebound, four-assist effort, Hibbert scored 10 points, grabbed seven rebounds, and blocked three shots, and Owens played a tough defense in the losing effort, and Florida was not able to secure the win until Owens missed a key three-pointer late in the game. The Hoyas came closer than any other team to beating Florida during the Gators national championship tournament run.\nThe Hoyas′ 23–10 record gave Georgetown its first 20-plus win season since 2000-01. They were ranked No. 23 in the final Associated Press Poll of the year and No. 16 in the postseason Coaches' Poll, the first Georgetown team to finish the season with a national ranking since 2000–01.\nIn October 2006, just before the following season began, sophomore guard Josh Thornton opted to leave the team, and he transferred from Georgetown to Towson at the end of the fall 2006 semester. He had not appeared in a game since the February 9, 2006, meeting with St. John's, and he transferred in search of greater playing time.\nRankings.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "Steven Leonard Hayes (born August 2, 1955) is an American former basketball player and coach. He played for several years for a variety of teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as well as in the Continental Basketball Association and in Europe. He is also known for his standout college career at Idaho State University, where he is recognized as one of the best players in the school's history.\nCollege career.\nBorn in American Falls, Idaho, Hayes attended Aberdeen High School in Aberdeen. A center, he enrolled at Idaho State University in nearby Pocatello. As a freshman, Hayes averaged 9.8 points and 6.8 rebounds per game and was a valuable contributor to a Bengals team that went won a share of the Big Sky Conference title, and won a tiebreaker playoff game to earn a berth in the NCAA tournament. As a sophomore, he developed into one of the top players in the conference, averaging 20.4 points and 13.3 rebounds. Hayes led the Big Sky in scoring and rebounding and earned first team All-Conference honors.\nIn his junior season, Hayes again earned first team All-Conference accolades, averaging 19.7 points and 10.6 rebounds per game (leading the conference in both statistical categories). The Bengals again tied for the conference regular-season title but did not play in the postseason.\nHis final collegiate season in 1976–77 was a special one for Hayes and the Bengals. Hayes again averaged a double-double at 20.2 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. He was named first team All-Big Sky for the third consecutive year, becoming only the third player in league history to do so. Idaho State went in league play to win the regular season championship and captured their first Big Sky tournament title at home to clinch a berth in the 32-team NCAA tournament. Once there, the Bengals made the most of their opportunity. After a win over Long Beach State in the first round of the West regional on their home court, ISU faced national power UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen in Provo, Utah. The Bruins were going for their eleventh consecutive Final Four appearance – an NCAA record. Hayes scored 27 points and recorded 12 rebounds as the Bengals upset UCLA as Hayes was named to the All-Regional team.\nAt the close of his career, Hayes finished second in school history in scoring (1,933 points) and first in rebounding (1,147) and blocked shots (207). He also holds the Big Sky Conference records for total rebounds in a career, career blocked shots per game (3.51) and blocked shots in a game (10 in 1976). He was inducted into the Idaho State athletic Hall of Fame in 1988.\nProfessional career.\nHayes was drafted in the fourth round of the 1977 NBA draft by the New York Knicks (76th pick overall), but did not make the final roster. Instead, he signed with Fernet Tonic Bologna in Italy, where he played for two seasons, averaging 19.3 points and 8.6 rebounds per game.\nFor the 1979–80 season, Hayes returned to the United States to play for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, where he teamed up with future NBA players Brad Davis and Ron Davis to win the 1980 CBA championship. Hayes averaged 19.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game in the playoffs (up from his regular season averages of 11.6, 7.8 and 1.5 respectively) and was named CBA Playoff MVP.\nHayes returned to Italy for the next season and averaged 18.1 points and 10.7 rebounds for Tai Ginseng Gorizia. For the 1981–82 season, Hayes finally made his NBA debut for the San Antonio Spurs on December 30, 1981. He split the season between the Spurs, Detroit Pistons and Anchorage Northern Knights. The next couple of seasons, Hayes played a reserve role for several NBA teams: the Cleveland Cavaliers, Seattle SuperSonics, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Utah Jazz. His career NBA averages over five seasons were 2.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.\nIn the middle of his time with the NBA, Hayes had a standout season for the Tampa Bay Thrillers of the CBA in 1984–85. He averaged 20.5 points and 8.9 rebounds per game and was named CBA MVP for the season. He also played parts of two seasons with the Rapid City Thrillers and Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets after his last NBA game. His career CBA averages were 14.7 points and 8.1 rebounds per game. Hayes also played briefly in France after the completion of his United States career.\nCoaching career and life after basketball.\nFollowing the close of his playing career, Hayes became an assistant coach for the CBA's Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets in 1990, then was named head coach of the Rockford Lightning for the 1990–91 CBA season, leading the team to a 23–33 record. He then moved to the Tri-City Chinook to become the team's head coach and general manager. In two seasons with the Chinook, Hayes compiled a 42–46 record.\nHayes stepped away from professional basketball in 1994 to accept a fundraising role in the Idaho State athletic department. While there, he also served as the interim women's basketball coach for the 1995–96 season, going 8–18 in his one season.\nHayes left Idaho State for an IT consulting opportunity and has continued on in business roles. He is a board member for the National Basketball Retired Players Association, serving as secretary of that organization."

        "title": "List of FIFA Club World Cup winning managers",
        "text": "The FIFA Club World Cup is an international association football competition organised by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship was first contested as the FIFA Club World Championship in 2000. It was not held between 2001 and 2004 due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. Following a change in format which saw the FIFA Club World Championship absorb the Intercontinental Cup, it was relaunched in 2005 and took its current name the season afterwards.\nThe current format of the tournament involves seven teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks; the winners of that year's edition of the Asian AFC Champions League, African CAF Champions League, North American CONCACAF Champions League, South American Copa Libertadores, Oceanian OFC Champions League and European UEFA Champions League, along with the host nation's national champion, participate in a straight knockout tournament.\nPep Guardiola was the first manager to win the tournament on four occasions; he led Spanish club Barcelona to success in 2009 and 2011, coached German side Bayern Munich to victory in 2013, and won a fourth title with English club Manchester City to victory in 2023. He is also the first manager to win the tournament with three different clubs. Carlo Ancelotti has won three titles (once with Milan in 2007, twice with Real Madrid in 2014 and 2022), Zinedine Zidane has won two titles (in 2016 and 2017, both with Real Madrid), and eleven other managers have each won the competition once. Guardiola is the most recent manager to have won the FIFA Club World Cup, doing so with Manchester City in the 2023 edition.\nList of managers in the final.\nBrazilian, Spanish and German managers hold the joint-record for most consecutive appearances of winning coaches, with three back-to-back triumphs each; a Brazilian manager won the final in 2000, 2005 and 2006, a Spanish manager did so in 2009, 2010 and 2011, while a German manager accomplished the feat in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Spanish managers have won also won the most total finals, with six (the aforementioned three, plus in 2013, 2015 and 2023).\nRafael Benítez of Spain became the first manager to reach the FIFA Club World Cup final with a foreign club when English side Liverpool side lost the 2005 final under his leadership; he led other foreign clubs to the final on two further occasions, winning in 2010 with Italian side Internazionale and losing in 2012 with English team Chelsea. Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Zinedine Zidane, Santiago Solari, Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel are the other managers to win the final with a foreign club, with Ancelotti (2014 and 2022), Zidane (2016 and 2017) and Guardiola (2013 and 2023) the only ones to accomplish this on multiple occasions, Ancelotti and Zidane while managing Real Madrid, and Guardiola while managing Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nAlong with Ancelotti and Zidane, Guardiola is the only other manager to have led the same club to the final on more than one occasion, coming out victorious with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. He also won the final in 2013 as coach of Bayern Munich and in 2023 as coach of Manchester City, becoming the first manager to win the trophy four times and also the first manager to win the trophy with three different clubs. \nThe inaugural final in 2000 remains the only one to see two managers from the same nation, with both hailing from Brazil.\nResults by manager.\nPep Guardiola is the only manager to have won four FIFA Club World Cups; he won twice with Barcelona, once with Bayern Munich and once with Manchester City. He is also the first manager to win the tournament with three different clubs. Guardiola also holds the record for the most appearances in the final, with the aforementioned four. Lamine N'Diaye of Senegal in 2010, Faouzi Benzarti of Tunisia in 2013 and Masatada Ishii of Japan in 2016 were the only non-European and non-South American managers to have appeared in the final. The aforementioned three managers, as well as Zoran Mamić in 2018, Ricardo Ferretti in 2020 and Ramón Díaz in 2022, are the only ones to have led a club outside Europe and South America into the decisive match.\nResults by nationality.\nSpanish managers have had the most success in the competition, amassing six titles in eight total final appearances. Brazilian managers have won four titles, German and Italian managers have each won three, French managers have won two, and a Scottish manager has won the title once. Argentine managers hold the dubious record of the most losses in the final with six, including defeats in three consecutive editions; a manager from Argentina has only won the competition on one occasion.\nResults by continent.\nEuropean managers remain the most successful of the competition, with a total of fifteen titles. Their South American counterparts are second with five titles, while Africa has had two managers lead a club into the final, and Asia has had one."

        "text": "The North Island cricket team is a representative cricket team based in New Zealand. They have played intermittently in first-class and List A cricket since 1894. They have most frequently played against the South Island cricket team, but have also played first-class matches against touring national sides. In the 1981–82, 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, they faced South Island in one-day matches billed as the \"Plunket Shield\", while similar contests in 2003–04 and 2004–05 were named the \"State of Origin\" matches.\nNorth Island v South Island.\nThe first-class matches between North Island and South Island have often been used to help the national selectors choose teams for forthcoming tours or Test series. South Island won the first match between the two teams in 1903–04, by two wickets. North Island won the most recent first-class match in 1999–2000 by 32 runs.\nIn all, the two teams have played each other 12 times in first-class matches. North Island have won six times, South Island four times, and two matches have been drawn.\nThe highest score for North Island is 208 not out by Bert Sutcliffe in 1947–48, and the best innings and match bowling figures are 5 for 37 and 10 for 101 by Bob Blair in 1957–58.\nIn their five List A matches, North Island have won four times, South Island once.\nPlayers.\nThe following players have appeared for North Island, in either first-class or List A matches."

        "text": "The 2013 Daytona 500, the 55th running of the event, was held on February 24, 2013, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida over 200 laps and on the 2.5-mile (4 km) asphalt tri-oval. It was the first race of the 2013 Sprint Cup season. Danica Patrick won the pole for the race, becoming the first woman to earn a pole position in NASCAR's highest division. She also achieved the best-ever finish by a woman at the Daytona 500, finishing 8th. Jimmie Johnson, driving for Hendrick Motorsports, won the race, making this his first win of the season and his second win in the \"Great American Race\" and his first since the 2006 race. His teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished 2nd while Mark Martin, Brad Keselowski, and Ryan Newman rounded out the Top 5.\nThe race was the final Daytona 500 starts for Mark Martin, Dave Blaney, Juan Pablo Montoya, Travis Kvapil, David Reutimann, Scott Speed, and Jeff Burton.\nReport.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees. Matt Kenseth was the defending race winner. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of ARCA, AMA Superbike, USCC, SCCA, and Motocross. The track features multiple layouts including the primary high speed tri-oval, a sports car course, a motorcycle course, and a karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nIn preparation for the race, NASCAR held several test sessions on January 10–12, 2013, for teams to test the sixth generation of race cars. Every test session began at 9 a.m. EST, paused between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. EST, and concluded at 5 p.m. EST. During the first session on the morning of January 10, 2013, thirty-four drivers participated; Kenseth, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, was quickest with a speed of 192.757 mph while Denny Hamlin had the highest speed of 195.712 mph during the second session in the afternoon.\nThe third test session, held during the morning of January 11, was led by Jeff Burton after having the highest speed of 194.805 mph. The fourth session was the first session in which multiple drivers were on track to draft, which resulted in a large accident following contact between Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Marcos Ambrose. Following the crash, ten teams left the track because of a shortage of parts for the new car. During that fourth session, held during the afternoon, thirty-two drivers participated with 2011 race winner Trevor Bayne being quickest with a speed of 199.650 mph. During the fifth session, held on the morning of January 12, twenty-one drivers participated; Kenseth was quickest with a speed of 194.062 mph. Greg Biffle was quickest with a speed of 194.936 mph in the final session.\nPractice and qualifying.\nSeven practice sessions were held before the race. The first two on February 16 ran 120 minutes and 105 minutes each. The next two on February 20 were 90 minutes each. Two days later, two more 60 minute practice sessions were scheduled. The final practice session was held on February 23. Joey Logano was quickest with a time of 46.057 seconds in the first session, less than one-hundredth of a second faster than Austin Dillon. Danica Patrick was just off Dillon's pace, followed by Paul Menard, Burton and Kasey Kahne. Bayne was seventh, still within two-tenths of Logano's time. In the second practice session, Patrick remained fastest with a time of 45.867 seconds, less than one second quicker than second-placed Tony Stewart. Kyle Busch took third place, ahead of Earnhardt Jr., Jamie McMurray and Bayne.\nForty-five cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three raced because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session only determined the first two positions, while the rest of the drivers qualified by the 2013 Budweiser Duels. Patrick clinched her first pole during her Sprint Cup career, with a time of 45.817 seconds, and became the first woman to win the pole position in the Sprint Cup Series. She was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon.\nOnce the qualifying session were completed, Patrick commented, \"I was brought up to be the fastest driver, not the fastest girl. That was instilled in me from very young, from the beginning. Then I feel like thriving in those moments, where the pressure's on, has also been a help for me. I also feel like I've been lucky in my career to be with good teams and have good people around me. I don't think any of it would have been possible without that. For those reasons, I've been lucky enough to make history, be the first woman to do many things. I really just hope that I don't stop doing that. We have a lot more history to make. We are excited to do it.\"\nMichael Waltrip was quickest in the third practice with 45.375 seconds, followed by David Ragan, Stewart, Menard and Kyle Busch. Kahne led fourth practice with 45.515 seconds, only one-tenth of a second faster than Greg Biffle. Gordon was third ahead of Patrick and Carl Edwards. Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch were the winners of the Budweiser Duels. The qualifying grid was finalized with Harvick in third and Kyle Busch fourth. Biffle qualified fifth ahead of Kahne, Juan Pablo Montoya, Dillon, Jimmie Johnson and Clint Bowyer. Drivers who failed to qualify were Mike Bliss and Brian Keselowski.\nAric Almirola was fastest in fifth practice with a 45.699 seconds lap, ahead of Burton, Earnhardt Jr., Bobby Labonte and Michael McDowell. Stewart led the sixth session ahead of Gordon and Patrick. Kahne was next with a 45.711 second lap ahead of Kenseth with 45.827 seconds. Earnhardt's 45.319 seconds topped the final practice session, followed by David Gilliland and Bowyer. Ambrose and Almirola rounded out the first five drivers in the fourth and fifth positions.\nCrash at the DRIVE4COPD 300.\nOn February 23, a 14-car crash in the DRIVE4COPD 300 left 33 spectators injured. On the final lap of the Nationwide Series race, Regan Smith got turned into the wall while trying to block Brad Keselowski, causing a chain reaction, in which Kyle Larson's car flew into the catch fencing. The impact ripped out its engine on the pathway in between the fence and first row of the grandstands. A tire and some other debris flew over the fence and landed halfway up the stands. \"I didn't know what to think. I'm an emotional person and I immediately started to cry. It was very scary. Absolutely scary\", a spectator remarked. Local officials reported that 19 people were taken to the hospital, including two in critical condition, while others were treated on-site at the infield care center. The incident raised questions about safety at Daytona International Speedway. NASCAR chose to repair the catch fencing overnight and have the Daytona 500 go on as scheduled.\nRace.\nThere were 28 lead changes among 14 different drivers. Danica Patrick stayed in the limelight, running in the Top 10 all afternoon. On lap 90, she passed Michael Waltrip on a restart following a caution, which was brought out for debris, and she became the first woman to lead the Daytona 500. In total, she led on three separate occasions for a total of 5 laps.\nSeveral pre-race favorites struggled. There were two major wrecks that occurred during the race: The first one was on lap 33. This began when Kyle Busch, heading into turn 1, turned Kasey Kahne into the infield. As the field checked up, a total of 6 more cars were collected: Tony Stewart, Kevin Harvick, Jamie McMurray, Casey Mears, Juan Pablo Montoya, and Brad Keselowski. Later, on lap 136, as cars checked up in front of them in turn 2, Keselowski got turned sideways by Trevor Bayne, who then got sideways himself, came up the track, and collected 7 more cars (totaling nine in all): Austin Dillon, Carl Edwards; Ricky Stenhouse Jr.; David Ragan, David Gilliland, Josh Wise, and Terry Labonte. Jeff Gordon led the first 31 laps, but soon his car kept overheating and he never threatened the leaders after dropping back on lap 32, finishing 20th. Matt Kenseth led the most laps, at 86, but his day ended on lap 150 with an engine failure.\nJimmie Johnson, racing in his 400th career Sprint Cup start, was back in the field for most of the race. He emerged from the pack with 16 laps to go and seized control with 10 to go, racing past Keselowski on the final restart. A caution with six laps to go for debris bunched up the field, but Johnson held on staving off a last lap charge by Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Mark Martin. \"I had a lot of confidence those final few laps, leading the train,\" Johnson said. \"I knew just how fast this car was.\" Keselowski finished fourth. Greg Biffle and Danica Patrick had entered the final lap in second and third place respectively before both were shuffled back by Earnhardt and Martin. Patrick finished eighth, becoming the first woman to finish in the top ten at the Daytona 500. She blamed inexperience for the late fall, saying \"I didn't know what to do, exactly\" in the final scramble. Johnson, however, said that Patrick looked \"really comfortable\" all race. \"She held a great wheel, was smooth, took advantage of runs when she had them.\"\nJohnson became the sixth driver to win a race in his 400th Sprint Cup start, following Lee Petty, Richard Petty, David Pearson, Dave Marcis, and Dale Earnhardt. It also marked the first NASCAR win for Schuberth."

        "text": "Robert Hoskins Lloyd (born 3 March 1943) is a former rugby union player who played for Clifton RFC, Harlequins, Surrey, Barbarians and the England national rugby union team.\nLloyd was born in Plympton, Devon and spent the early part of his life in Glasgow. He attended Cheltenham College and first played for Clifton in the 1961–62 season after leaving Cheltenham, but only played a few games for the club before joining Harlequins, where he spent the remainder of his rugby career in England.\nLloyd played against the 1967 New Zealand touring team for the Midlands, London &amp; Home Counties at Leicester on 28 October 1967, scoring a try. A week later on 4 November 1967 Lloyd was selected to play for England, making his international debut against New Zealand at Twickenham and scoring two tries as England lost 16–23. He was also invited to play for the Barbarians against New Zealand later that month, scoring a further try, as well as appearing for the Barbarians in the 1967 match against Leicester. Lloyd played in all four England matches of the 1968 Five Nations, which brought his total of England appearances to five. He appeared in the England trial matches in 1969 and toured the Far East with England in 1971 captaining the England team in a non cap match against Japan in the absence of the tour captain Budge Rogers through injury but won no further full caps after 1968. He was selected for the 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa but declined the invitation due to engineering exam commitments.\nLloyd was Harlequins' captain in the 1970–71 and 1971–72 seasons and also represented the Surrey county team, playing in their county championship finals in 1967, when they shared the title with Durham and in 1971, when they beat Gloucestershire 14 – 3 at Kingsholm. His total of 46 appearances for Surrey has been exceeded only by Bob Hiller.\nIn August 1973 Lloyd emigrated to Hong Kong where he played rugby for the Hong Kong Football Club and captained Hong Kong against Wales in 1975 and the Hong Kong Sevens team in the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens in 1976 during which they won the Plate competition. Lloyd worked for the Hong Kong Government for 30 years until his retirement in 2003. He has since worked with a Hong Kong civil engineering contractor as its Business Development Director and as a Project Manager for a civil engineering consultant until his third retirement at the end of 2015. \nLloyd was inducted into the Harlequins F. C. Hall of Fame in December 2012.\nBob Lloyd was a civil engineer who studied at the Hatfield Polytechnic and is a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a Member of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers."

He earned 12 caps in total scoring 34 points with 1 try, 4 conversions and 7 penalties. He won his final cap also against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 27 March 2004.

        "title": "List of FIFA Club World Cup finals",
        "text": "The FIFA Club World Cup is an international association football competition organised by the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. It is the replacement or continuation of the Intercontinental Cup. The championship was first contested as the FIFA Club World Championship in 2000. It was not held between 2001 and 2004 due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. Following a change in format which saw the FIFA Club World Championship absorb the Intercontinental Cup, it was relaunched in 2005 and took its current name the season afterwards.\nThe current format of the tournament involves seven teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks; the winners of that year's edition of the Asian AFC Champions League, African CAF Champions League, North American CONCACAF Champions League, South American Copa Libertadores, Oceanian OFC Champions League and European UEFA Champions League, along with the host nation's national champion, participate in a straight knockout tournament.\nReal Madrid holds the record for most victories, winning the competition five times since its inception. Teams from Spain have won the tournament the most times, with eight wins produced from that nation. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is the most successful confederation of the competition with sixteen titles earned by nine of its clubs. \nThe current champions are Manchester City, who won their first title following a 4-0 win against Fluminense in the 2023 final, held at the King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nHistory.\nThe first final of the competition was an all-Brazilian affair, as well as the only one which saw one side have home advantage. Vasco da Gama could not take advantage of its local support, being beaten by Corinthians 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in extra time. The second edition of the competition was planned for Spain in 2001, and was supposed to feature twelve clubs. However, it was canceled on 18 May, due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. FIFA agreed with Toyota to merge the Toyota Cup and Club World Championship into one event.\nThe 2005 edition saw Brazilian club São Paulo pushed to the limit by Saudi side Al-Ittihad to reach the final. In the final, one goal from Mineiro was enough to dispatch English club Liverpool; Mineiro became the first player to score in a Club World Cup final. Internacional defeated defending world and South American champions São Paulo in the 2006 Copa Libertadores Finals in order to qualify for the 2006 tournament. In the semi-finals, Internacional beat Egyptian side Al Ahly, qualifying for the final against Barcelona from Spain. One late goal from Adriano Gabiru allowed the trophy to be kept in Brazil once again.\nIt was in 2007 when Brazilian hegemony was finally broken; Italian side Milan disputed a close match against Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds, who were pushed by over 67,000 fans at Yokohama's International Stadium, and won 1–0 to reach the final. In the final, Milan defeated Argentine side Boca Juniors 4–2, in a match that saw the first player to be sent off in a Club World Cup final, Milan's Kakha Kaladze from Georgia, in the 77th minute. Eleven minutes later, Boca Juniors' Pablo Ledesma would join Kaladze as he too was sent off. The following year, Manchester United would emulate Milan by beating their semi-final opponents, Japan's Gamba Osaka, 5–3. They saw off Ecuadorian club LDU Quito 1–0 in the final, as the English side became the second European team to win the tournament.\nBarcelona dethroned world and European champions Manchester United in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final to qualify for the 2009 edition of the Club World Cup. Barcelona defeated Mexican club Atlante 3–1 in the semi-finals and met Estudiantes from Argentina in the final. After a very close encounter which saw the need for extra time, Lionel Messi scored from a header to snatch victory for Barcelona and complete an unprecedented sextuple (six trophies in a calendar year). The 2010 edition saw the first non-European and non-South American side to reach the final: Congo's Mazembe defeated Brazil's Internacional 2–0 in the semi-finals to set up a final with Italian Internazionale, who had beaten South Korean club Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma 3–0. Internazionale would go on to beat Mazembe by the same scoreline to win their fifth title of the year.\nIn 2011, Barcelona would once again show its class after winning their semi-final match 4–0 against Qatari club Al-Sadd. In the final, Barcelona would win by the same scoreline against Brazilian side Santos; this is, to date, the largest final winning margin by any victor of the competition. The 2012 edition saw Europe's dominance come to an end, as Corinthians traveled to Japan to join Barcelona in becoming two-time winners of the competition. In the semi-finals, Al Ahly managed to keep the scoreline close as Corinthians' Paolo Guerrero scored to send the \"Timão\" into their second final. Guerrero would once again come through for Corinthians in the final as the \"Timão\" saw off English side Chelsea 1–0 in order to bring the trophy back to Brazil.\nList of finals.\nThe International Stadium Yokohama in Japan has played host to the FIFA Club World Cup final the most times, with six title-deciding matches held. Along with the Estádio do Maracanã, they are the only venues in the world to have hosted both the FIFA World Cup final and the FIFA Club World Cup final (International Stadium Yokohama hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final while the deciding match of the 1950 FIFA World Cup was disputed at the Maracanã). The 2000 FIFA Club World Championship Final remains the highest attended final of the competition, with 73,000 fans attending the all-Brazilian match. The final was also the only one which saw two clubs from the same nation dispute it. The 2021 final had the fewest spectators, with 32,871 (not including the 2020 final, which had restricted seating due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nThe 2007 final holds the record for most goals scored in regulation in a Club World Cup Final, with six goals scored by five players, while the 2000 final remains the only scoreless decider. The 2011 final became the most lopsided match of the competition, with the triumphant team winning by a difference of four goals, joined by the 2023 final twelve years later.\nStatistics.\nResults by club.\nReal Madrid holds the record number of victories in the competition with five. Corinthians remain the only club World Champion to have qualified to the competition by being the host nation's national champion.\nResults by nation.\nSpain's La Liga is the most successful national league of the competition, with eight titles won. Brazil's Brasileirão and England's Premier League are second with four titles each. Italy's Serie A and Germany's Bundesliga are fourth with two titles each. Serie A and the Bundesliga remain the only undefeated national leagues which have had representatives play in the competition. Argentina's Primera División carries the dubious honour of losing the most finals without ever winning the world title, with four defeats."

        "text": "The 1944–45 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team represented the University of Illinois.\nRegular season.\nAfter the second worst season in Doug Mills tenure as the head coach of the Fighting Illini, the ongoing war created even more havoc with the 1944–45 season. The Illini were required to play games close to home which meant they played certain teams multiple times. For example, the team played Great Lakes three times, Chanute Field, in nearby Rantoul, Illinois, two times and George Mikan and the DePaul Blue Demons two times as well. As the season progressed, Mills experimented with several lineups, including a 19 player barrage versus Nebraska. These varied lineups allowed Mills to play an impressive freshman, Johnny Orr, playing his only season for Illinois prior to rejoining his high school coach, Dolph Stanley, at Beloit College in Beloit, Wisconsin.\nThe Big Ten Conference season was unusual as well. The Illini dropped their opening game to Michigan followed by a seven-game winning streak then concluding with four consecutive losses. The heaviest load fell on the hands of sophomores Walt Kirk and Howard Judson with freshman Walt Kersulis, Jack Burmaster, and Orr also being major contributors. Kirk would be named a Consensus All-American for his performance during the season.\nThe team completed their season with an overall record of 13 wins and 7 losses with a conference mark of 7 and 5 for a third-place finish. They finished with a 7 - 3 record at home and a road record of 5 - 4. The starting lineup consisted of Walton Kirk, Howard Judson, Johnny Orr, Jack Burmaster, Don Delaney and Walt Kersulis.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season"

They became more successful in the twenty-first century, and won several trophies.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was criticised in removing departmental sides, with players voicing their concern to revive the teams. However, in August 2023, the PCB announced of return departmental cricket with the start of 2023–24 President's Trophy, therefore resuming the participation of the team.\nHonours.\nQuaid-e-Azam Trophy \nPatron's Trophy \nNational One-day Championship"

In the final, defending champions India defeated Pakistan by 2 wickets to secure their 2nd Blind Cricket World Cup title under the captaincy of Ajay Kumar Reddy. Six teams, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Australia and Nepal played in the tournament, with Nepal making their first ever appearance.\nIndia played all of their group stage matches of the tournament at neutral venues in the United Arab Emirates, after the foreign ministry of India blocked them from travelling to Pakistan. It was later revealed that the Cricket Association for the Blind in India and Pakistan Blind Cricket Council had agreed to shift the Indian matches to the UAE. Thus, only Nepal and Bangladesh were willing to play matches in Pakistan.\nInitially, Pakistan was selected as the main host nation to host the tournament, with the UAE later agreeing to host some of the matches. It was the first time that Pakistan had been selected to host the Blind Cricket World Cup since 2006, and marked the first instance where UAE also had hosted few matches as a part of the World Cup.\nSharjah Cricket Stadium hosted the final between India and Pakistan on 20 January; prior to the World Cup, Pakistan had originally been selected to host the final. India and Pakistan were the only teams to play against each other in the finals of the Blind Cricket World Cup on three consecutive occasions.\nIn the final, Pakistan batted first and managed to score 308/8 after being put into bat by India. India chased down the target of 309 with 16 balls to spare to clinch the title. India thus maintained their unbeaten record in the tournament.\nCurrent squad.\nIndia national blind cricket team current Squad 2016"

Following a change in format which saw the FIFA Club World Championship absorb the Intercontinental Cup, it was relaunched in 2005 and took its current name the season afterwards.\nThe current format of the tournament involves seven teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks; the winners of that year's edition of the Asian AFC Champions League, African CAF Champions League, North American CONCACAF Champions League, South American Copa Libertadores, Oceanian OFC Champions League and European UEFA Champions League, along with the host nation's national champion, participate in a straight knockout tournament.\nSpanish club Real Madrid leads the table in most titles, most wins and most points. Auckland City have the most tournament appearances with eleven, while Al Ahly have played the most matches (25), also holding the dubious record of the most losses with a total of fourteen. There are five teams which have won all of their games in the competition on the quest to their respective title or titles, those being Internazionale, Manchester City, Milan, São Paulo (two wins each) and Bayern Munich (four wins).\nAll-time table.\nCorrect after the 2023 tournament:"

        "title": "Central Missouri Mules basketball",
        "text": "The Central Missouri Mules basketball team represents the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, Missouri, in the NCAA Division II men's basketball competition (the school's women's basketball team is known as the \"Jennies\"). The team is currently coached by Doug Karleskint, who replaced Kim Anderson after his departure to become head coach at the University of Missouri. The Mules currently compete and are one of two founding members of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA). The basketball team plays its home games in the Multipurpose Building on campus.\nOverview.\nCentral Missouri annually plays a twenty-two-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule that includes two exhibition games. The conference schedule consists of playing every MIAA member at least once, some twice.\nHistory.\nCentral Missouri's basketball program was founded in 1905, thirty-four years after the university was founded. Prior to 1912, the Mules were an independent team; in 1912, the Mule were a founding member of the MIAA. Overall, the team has won 24 conference championships and four national titles.\nThe beginning: 1905–1912.\nIn 1905, the team's first year, Joe Ferguson was named the head coach and only played on game – Co. F Independence. In 1906, the team's first full season, Ferguson led the Normals (as they were known until 1919) to a 7–8 record. In the 1907–08 season, the team's losing record switched and finished with a 7–2 record with Guy Lowman as the coach. In 1908, A.A. Mason took over the team for seasons leaving with a record of 16–10. Frank Winters then took over for the next two seasons as head coach, finishing in 1912 with a record of 9–11.\nA new era: first 30 years of the MIAA (1912–1946).\n1912 began a new era for the Normals basketball team: the team became a founding member of the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen took the reins as head coach. In his first two seasons as head coach, Allen lead the team to back-to-back MIAA championships, combining an overall record of 26–11 and 15–1 MIAA record. The next five seasons, Allen lead the Normals to a record of 58–20 and leaving in 1919 to return to his alma mater, The University of Kansas.\nAfter Allen left for KU, Willard N. Greim took over as coach for the next four seasons. During Greim's tenure, the Mules went 70–21 winning one conference championship in 1920–21. During the 1923 season, Greim coached the first two games, but then Tad C. Reid would coach the remainder of the season, as well as the next 14 seasons. During Reid's 15 seasons, the Mules won four MIAA championships and two National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) National championships. In both 1937 and 1938, Central Missouri won back-to-back NAIB National championships. In the 1937 Championship Game, the NAIB's first-ever tournament, Central Missouri took a 35–24 victory over Morningside College, and in 1938, the Mules defeated Roanoke College 45–30 to win their second straight national championship. Following the two back-to-back national championship seasons, Tom Scott led the Mules to an 87–35 record, winning the MIAA Championship for the next five seasons. Clarence Whiteman replaced Scott for one season, and Robert White followed for two more seasons. Scott returned for the 1945–46 season.\n \nPost-World War II: 1946–1975.\nFor the next thirty years after World War II, the Mules saw six coaches come and go, a few who would later go on to lead some NCAA Division I teams very successfully. In 1946, Earl Keth, a member of the 1937 and 1938 Central Missouri State National Championship teams, took the reins as head coach, a position he would hold for 15 seasons. During Keth's first few seasons, the Mules began what would be one of eight losing seasons under Keth. It was not until the 1950–51 season that the Mules won a conference championship under Keth. The next few seasons, though, Keth's teams had losing records, and then winning another conference championship in 1956–57. In 1961, future-NCAA Division I coach, Gene Bartow, took over the program. During his three seasons, Bartow coached the Mules to a 47–21 record, before leaving for Valparaiso University. Following Bartow in 1965 was Joe B. Hall, who led the team to a 19–6 season, and an MIAA conference championship. Chuck Smith coached for one season, 1965–66, finishing with a 14–8, 7–3 MIAA record.\nIn 1966, Norm Short took over for the Mules, staying for six seasons. In that time Short led the team to a 74–69 record, with two conference championships. After the Mules fell to 7–19 in 1971–72, Jim Kampen replaced Short. Kampen led the team for three seasons with a total record of 32–46.\nAnother national championship: 1975–2002.\nIn 1975, Tom Smith took over the program for five years. During his five years as head coach, Smith led the Mules to an 86–46 overall record, winning the MIAA Championship in the 1979–80 season. After that season, Smith left for Valparaiso. Former Iowa State coach, Lynn Nance was hired as Smith's successor. During Nance's first season, the Mules won the conference championship. The next two seasons, Nance compiled a record of 43–16 overall with a 17–7 MIAA record. In the 1983–84 season, Nance led the Mules to A Conference Championship and the NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship. The following year, Nance led the Mules to another conference title and finished his career at Central Missouri with a 114–35 record.\nNance left Warrensburg after the 1984-85 season, and Nance's assistant coach, Jim Wooldridge, took the reins of the program. In his final three seasons at the helm, Wooldridge led the Mules to the NCAA Tournament, with 20 or more wins each season. Wooldridge left for Southwest Texas State after the 1990–91 season, leaving Central Missouri with a 131–48 overall record. Jerry Hughes, current athletics director for Central Missouri, coached the 1991–92 season as the interim head coach, ending with a 15–13 record.\nIn 1992, Bob Sundvold was hired as the next head coach, which was his first coaching job. Under Sundvold, the Mules went 81–39 over four seasons. Sundvold's squads made three trips to the NCAA Division II tournament, reaching the Elite Eight in 1995. After Sundvold left, Don Doucette arrived in Warrensburg, compiling a record of 89–76 over six seasons.\nKim Anderson: 2002–2014.\nOn April 12, 2002, Kim Anderson was selected as the next head coach. While at Central Missouri, he won more games than any other coach in school history with a 274-95 (.743) career record. He guided the Mules to two Final Fours, five MIAA regular season championships, four MIAA Tournament Titles and one National Championship.\nIn the 2006–07 season, the Mules returned to the Division II Elite Eight in Springfield, Massachusetts. They defeated Montevallo to move on to the semi-finals, where they faced the then-unbeaten defending Division II champion Winona State. The Mules lost to Winona in overtime 90–85, ending the season 31–4, which set a new school record for most wins in a season. After the season, the NCAA announced that UCM led all of Division II in attendance for Men's Basketball, at 3,640 fans per home game.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Anderson led the Mules to a 30–5 overall record and captured the Division II National Championship in Evansville, Indiana. Anderson left to coach at his alma mater, the University of Missouri.\nDoug Karleskint: 2014–present.\nAfter Anderson left for Missouri, Doug Karleskint was hired as the next coach. In his first season, Karleskint led the Mules to a 25–7 record. That season included a regional appearance as Central Missouri bowed out in the regional semifinals."

        "title": "Association of Surfing Professionals Europe",
        "text": "The Association of Surfing Professionals Europe (ASP Europe) is the governing body for professional surfers in Europe and is dedicated to showcasing the continent's best talent in a variety of progressive formats. It is one of seven regions of the ASP World Tour.\nHistory.\nCreation of the WSL.\nFounded in 1989, the WSL Europe was formed to promote professional surfing in Europe. Its objective is to equally benefit European surfers, sponsors and event promoters alike.\nEach year this pro-am circuit include contests between January and November with QS 1,000 - QS 10,000 events, Junior, Longboard and specialty events. Most of the events are run at famous beaches for their quality waves: The Canary Islands, France, Portugal, Spain, England, Ireland, and the Azores Islands. All organized contests are at the best surfing beaches and at the best time of the year.\nMore than 200 of the best European professional surfers and traveling International athletes enter these events and guarantee to put on a great show.\nWSL Membership.\nMembership to the WSL is only available to individuals.\nWSL Europe Sanctioned Tours.\nWSL Qualifying Series events.\nA WSL QS 10,000 event is held at premium venues with a restricted field and offers 10,000 WSL Rankings points.\nWSL QS 1,000 - QS 6,000 events are a lower level of competition, compared to an WSL QS 10,000 event, with their importance indicated by how many points they are assigned: more points means generally better competition and prize money.\nWSL Junior events.\nIn 2013, 6 Men and 2 Women will represent Europe at the WSL Junior Championships. Junior events in Europe decide those qualifiers every year. Surfers must be under-18 years old to enter those events.\nWSL Longboard events.\nSame as for the Junior Tour, those events offer the possibility for the Best European longboarders to qualify for the coveted WSL Longboard Championship events.\nRules.\nJudging.\nIn contests surfers will be scored on a scale of 0.1 to 10.0, these scores will be broken up into increments of one-tenth.\nThe following scale can be use in order to relate descriptions with the score:\nJudging criteria.\nJudges will base the previous score on how successfully surfers display these following elements in each wave:\nSome of these elements may be more or less important base on the surfing conditions and the surfing area. This criterion is also different then in longboarding competition. All of this is focused on creating some type consistency that can be seen throughout the many different events.\nThe events themselves are previously declared QS 1,000 - QS 10,000 events; among other things this ranking shows what numbers of judges which are required at the event. QS 1,000 - QS 3,000 Qualifying Series events are required to have a six judge panel with four judges on each heat. A QS 4,000 - QS 6,000 Qualifying Series event requires seven judges with five of those judges on each heat. At QS 5,000 - QS 10,000 Qualifying Series events there are only allowed to be 3 judges from any one region. This is then limited to two at any world championship events. All events also require an WSL approved head judge who has the ability to make corrections to errors or any other events that may have affected the results.\nRules.\nThere are many rules out in the water which all revolve around the idea of right of way. A surfer has right of way if he or she is closer to the area where the wave is breaking, this is more commonly referred to as having the inside position. If another surfer takes off in front of the surfer which has the inside position then interference will be called and penalties will be enacted. In most circumstances it does not matter who stood up first but who has the inside position.\nA surfer can also be found guilty of inference if they catch more than their maximum number of waves in a heat and that this takes away from the other competitors ability to catch waves. A competitor is also not allowed to interfere with another competitor's paddling and maneuvering for a wave.\nThe rules of right-a-way vary slightly with the type of break. Point Breaks will always have a consistent direct of what is inside, that is the person further up the line will have right-away. In a single peak situation where there is both a left and a right two people are able to be on the wave at the same time provided that one goes left and one goes right and that neither crosses the path of the other to go one direction. If this does happen then the surfer who stood up first will get the right-a-way. On a multi peaked wave where the wave eventually comes together both peaks can be surfed until the surfers come together, when they do the surfer who stood up first has right-a-way and the other must maneuver to get off the wave without interrupting the other surfer.\nIn a one-on-one competition priority can be declared by the Head Judge. Once the person with priority has paddled for a wave priority is then turned over to the next person until that person does the same. The person with second priority can paddles for waves as long as it does not interfere with the other person and will only lose their priority if they catch a wave.\nA surfer who has already taken off or obtained possession of a wave maintains this position until the end of their ride. If another surfer takes off on the inside of this surfer then this person does not obtain priority and is considered to be snaking. If this surfer does not hurt the other surfers ride then both people can be scored based. If the judges determine that the snaking did interfere then the person will be penalized.\nInterference penalties are called by the judges and must have a majority to be declared an actual penalty. Interferences are shown as triangles on the score cards in various different ways depending on when or where in the heat they were made. If three or more waves are being scored then one wave will be dropped off the score card. If only the top two waves are being scored then 50% of the second best scored wave will be taken off. If a surfer has more than one then 50% of the best waves score will be taken off also. The surfer who has been interfered with will be allowed an additional wave to their maximum as long as it is within the time limit. If a surfer interferes more than twice in a heat then they must leave the competition area."

        "text": "Thomas Michael Hennigan (born October 24, 1951) is a former American football player and coach. He played professionally as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Detroit Lions from 1973 to 1975 New York Jets from 1976 to 1978. Hennigan served as and the head head football coach at the Tennessee Technological University from 1996 to 2005, compiling a record of 52–57.\nCollege career.\nBorn in Davenport, Iowa, Hennigan was raised in Washington, Iowa. Following graduation from Washington High School, Hennigan attended and played college football at Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa until the college discontinued their football program in 1970, whereupon he transferred to Tennessee Tech. While at Tech, he was an all-Conference selection in 1972 when he helped lead the Golden Eagles to the Ohio Valley Conference championship. The next season, as a senior, Hennigan was once again all-conference and a College Football All-America Team honorable mention as he amassed 110 tackles. The team finished the season with a record of 10–1 and an appearance in the Grantland Rice Bowl. Hennigan was selected to play in the All-American Bowl at season's end.\nProfessional playing career.\nDrafted by the Detroit Lions early in the fourth round of the 1973 NFL draft, Hennigan played three seasons at linebacker for the Lions. After the 1975 season, in which he played only four games for Detroit, Hennigan joined the New York Jets. He played three more NFL seasons for the Jets before a knee injury ended his playing career.\nCoaching career.\nHennigan got his coaching start in 1980, working with spring drills at his alma mater before moving on to East Tennessee State for two seasons as linebackers coach. He next served as defensive coordinator at Western Carolina University in 1982 and 1983. After his defense helped Western Carolina reach the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship title game in 1983, Hennigan departed for one-year stints as linebackers coach at Memphis State University in 1984, and defensive ends at Temple University in 1985. Hennigan returned to Tennessee Tech in 1986, beginning a twenty-year career on the coaching staff. He served as the schools defensive coordinator from 1986 through the 1995 season, after which he was named the head coach for the Golden Eagles. Over the following ten seasons Hennigan's teams compiled an overall record of 52 wins and 57 losses, with their best seasons being 2000 and 2001 when Tennessee Tech won eight games and seven games respectively and each year being ranked in the Division I-AA polls. Citing personal reasons and health concerns, Hennigan resigned as Tennessee Tech head coach in July, 2006. However, a week later he rescinded the resignation, instead taking a medical leave of absence. In November, 2006 Hennigan informed the university that he would not be returning from the medical leave.\nPersonal life.\nMike Hennigan earned a bachelor's degree in Health and Physical Education from Tennessee Tech in 1973. He and wife Leslie are the parents of four children. Hennigan was named to the Tennessee Tech Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. Youngest son Taylor also played his college football for Tennessee Tech."

His brothers Frank Cross, Lave Cross, and Amos Cross also played in the major leagues.\nUnusually, Joe Cross was not listed in baseball reference books for over a century. It was not until 2012, 124 years after his lone major league appearance, that research showed that Joe Cross made an appearance in one game for the Colonels on September 5, 1888. The game had long been credited to Lave Cross in the record books, but a contemporaneous report in The Cleveland Plain Dealer noted for the September 5 match that after a seventh inning injury to a player: \"Cross of the Graphics, a brother of Lave, a Louisville catcher, took (Toad Ramsey)'s place in right.\" \nAmos had died a few months earlier, and Frank was only 15 in 1888. This and other corroborating evidence placed Joe Cross in the game and in the record books, after over a century of waiting. \nAfter his brief playing career ended, Joe Cross lived in Cleveland and worked variously as a cigar maker, a caulker, a store keeper, a machinist, and an employee of Cleveland's Division of Water. Although he was the oldest of the four Kriz/Cross brothers who appeared in the majors, Joe outlived each of the other three."

The Grade I listed building, Sudbrook House, in the park, is now the clubhouse. \nHistory.\nThe Club was founded in February 1891, at a meeting at the Greyhound Hotel in Richmond. It briefly leased a course at Old Deer Park, before moving to Sudbrook Park in Petersham, where it has been located ever since.\nWithout a clubhouse initially, the members met in the Fox and Duck public house, which they also used for the changing rooms, before obtaining the lease of Sudbrook Park and House in 1898.\nGerman bombs fell on the course in 1940. The club made temporary rules to accommodate this.\nGolfing and competitions.\nThe club runs a full schedule of friendly and competitive golfing activities. It still runs competitions dating back to the first days of the club, of which notable competitions include:\nThe club has hosted visits from many professionals including, in 1975, Tom Watson playing his first game of golf in Britain. This was the day before playing in and winning his first Open Championship at Carnoustie, beating Jack Newton in a play-off.\nCourse.\nThe course was designed by Tom Dunn in 1896, one of many laid out by him during the explosion of popularity of the sport in the late 19th century.\nThe current layout of the course consists of six par 3, eight par 4 and four par 5 holes, with a total length of and a par of 70 (SSS 69).\nBetween 2010 and 2012, the course underwent significant renovation, including the construction of 56 new bunkers, as well as improvements to putting greens, tees and the planting of new trees along the fairways. Following these enhancements, the course was awarded first place in the Golf Inc. Monthly, Renovation of the Year for 2012.\nClubhouse.\nThe club's clubhouse, Sudbrook House, was built around 1725 by architect James Gibbs, for John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll. It is built of a combination of white Portland stone and dark red brick, and is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of early eighteenth-century English Palladian architecture.\nAt the centre of Sudbrook House is The Cube Room, which is the club's principal dining and function room. The Cube Room is of Baroque style, and as its name suggests, the height (over 30 feet) is the same as the width and length. The interior of The Cube Room is adorned with trophies of arms above the doorways from the Duke of Argyll's military achievements, and the Campbell family coat of arms carved in pine in the great panel above the mirror. The carved marble chimney is the work of Flemish sculptor Jan Michiel Rysbrack.\nOther facilities.\nIn addition to the course, there are extensive practice facilities, including: 2 putting greens, a 250-yard driving range with covered teaching bays, and a short-game practice area for chipping and bunker shots.\nThe clubhouse has two bars, one which is reserved exclusively for members, dining rooms, a TV lounge and a snooker room.\nThe course also has a pro shop and the clubhouse is available to host weddings and other social events."

He was selected by the Detroit Lions in the 1971 NFL draft, but played professional football for the BC Lions in 1971.\nMichigan.\nNewell played college football for the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1970. As a junior, he was the leading tackler for the 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team with a total of 70 tackles. The 1969 team was the first Michigan team to be coached by Bo Schembechler. It defeated the No. 1 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes to advance to the 1970 Rose Bowl. Newell had 14 tackles in the Rose Bowl, tied for second most on the team.\nNewell was politically active while at Michigan. During the fall of 1969, he was faced with a choice between traveling with the Michigan football team to Iowa for a football game scheduled for November 15, 1969, or traveling to Washington, D.C., to be part of the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, an antiwar protest that attracted over 500,000 demonstrators on the same day. After Newell chose to travel with the team, Schembechler praised him in his comments to the team for being \"out there in Iowa City with the rest of the team, and not in Washington with the damn hippies where he really wanted to be.\"\nAs a senior, Newell started at right defensive tackle in nine of the ten games played by the 1970 Michigan Wolverines football team. That team finished the season with a 9-1 record and allowed opponents to score a total of only 90 points, an average of nine points per game. On October 3, 1970, Newell had a career-high 15 tackles and a fumble recovery in Michigan's 14-10 victory over Texas A&amp;M. He had 123 career tackles in his three years at Michigan.\nAt the end of the 1970 season, Newell was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player by both the AP and UPI. He also played for the North team in the America Bowl All-Star football game in January 1971.\nProfessional football.\nIn January 1971, Newell was selected by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round (125th overall pick) of the 1971 NFL draft. However, he did not appear in any regular season NFL games. In September 1971, the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League announced that they were giving Newell a five-day tryout. After the trial period, he was activated by the Lions. He appeared in one game for the Lions and was released on September 24, 1971.\nLater years.\nAfter retiring from football, Newell returned to the Chicago area. He worked for 32 years in the financial services field for Smith Barney/Citigroup Global Markets, and he also served as the president of the Chicago Bond Club, the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois, and the University of Michigan Club of Chicago. He was also a member of the executive board of his alma mater, Notre Dame College Prep.\nNewell is married to Nancy Newell. They have three sons, Peter, Kevin and Brian, who was first team all Catholic league for the Fenwick Friars.\nIn 2009, Newell was inducted into the Notre Dame College Prep Hall of Honor."

        "text": "The Marianao baseball club played in the Cuban Professional League from the 1922–1923 season through to the 1960–1961 season. The club represented the populous town of Marianao in Havana and played their games at La Tropicana Stadium, official site of the league.\nHistory.\nAccording to some baseball historians, the Elefantes de Marianao (Marianao Elephants) was the first nickname used by the team. Although it is a little studied topic, the 1923-24 Billiken baseball card set includes pictures 15 cards each for each team that participated in the Cuban league during that season: Almendares, Habana, Santa Clara and Marianao. Indeed, Marianao players are wearing a uniform that shows the head of a white elephant on dark background.\nAt some point, the team wore gray uniforms and was recognized as the Marianao Frailes Grises (Grey Monks), probably a nickname based on the color of the robes of the Dominican and Augustinian monks that founded Marianao in 1719. Then, in 1948 the franchise was renamed as the Tigres de Marianao (Marianao Tigers), as they are usually cited, and also used a new uniform. Their flannels had black and orange piping with matching socks, perhaps recalling also those of its emblem, the \"tiger\". The team contended until the 1960–1961 period, during what turned out to be the Cuban League's final season.\nThe Marianao squad participated in 27 Cuban league seasons, finishing in first place four times, second place six times, third place seven times, and in fourth place a league record ten times. The team posted a 729-861 record in 1,590 games for a .458 winning percentage, which was the worst mark of the four Cuban league teams to play over 1,000 games.\nMarianao, managed by Merito Acosta, won its first title in the 1922–1923 season, to become the only team after Habana to win the league championship in its inaugural season. They earned its second championship in the 1936–1937 campaign, managed by Martin Dihigo, and clinched consecutive titles in the 1956–1957 and 1957–1958 seasons, guided by Napoleón Reyes. The latter two seasons they won the Caribbean Series, the only Series where they participated, becoming also the first team to win twice in the event's history.\nFollowing the 1959 Cuban Revolution, political tensions rose with the Fidel Castro government. In March 1961, one month after the regular Cuban baseball season ended, the regime decreed the abolition of professional baseball in Cuba.\nFacts.\nDuring the 1943–1944 season, the Marianao team became part of three rare occurrences in Cuban baseball history.\nOn December 2, 1943, Ramón Roger of the Elefantes de Cienfuegos pitched 11 scoreless innings against them in one game that went 20 innings and lasted four hours and 25 minutes, the longest game ever played in Cuban baseball history. Roger was credited with the victory, 6–5. Meanwhile, Luis Tiant Sr. blanked Cienfuegos for 14 innings, but was victimized by an error by shortstop Oral (Mickey) Burnette and suffered a heartbreaking loss.\nA few days later on December 11, Habana pitcher Manuel García hurled a no-hit, no-run game against Marianao at La Tropicana Stadium. It turned in to be the first no-hitter pitched at La Tropicana since its opening in 1930. Also in the same game, the Marianao infield executed the first triple play at the La Tropical grounds."

The deadline for submitting provisional rosters was January 16, but teams had until February 20 to finalize their roster decisions. Provisional rosters were announced on January 17, and final rosters were announced on February 20.\nIn the WBC, starting pitchers are allowed to throw 65 pitches in first-round games. This limit increases to 80 in the second round and 95 in the semifinal and final rounds. If a starting pitcher throws over 50 pitches in a game, he must not pitch again for a minimum of four days. Relief pitchers are allowed to pitch on consecutive days only if they threw less than 30 pitches on the previous day. Pitchers are not allowed to pitch on three consecutive days under any circumstances.\nInjured players could be freely replaced before the team's first game. Once a team begins play, injured catchers can be replaced at any time, but other injured players cannot be replaced until the team advances to the next round of the tournament.\nThe United States provisional roster is made up entirely of players from Major League Baseball (MLB), and the Dominican Republic provisional roster has only one player not signed to a team for the 2013 season. The Canadian team has 12 players who appeared in MLB in 2012, while Japan has none (three prominent Japanese MLB players, Yu Darvish, Ichiro Suzuki and two-time defending WBC MVP Daisuke Matsuzaka, chose not to play). Though five members who competed for the Cuban national team in the 2009 WBC have since defected, the Cuban team is considered strong. Three members of MLB.com's Top 100 prospect list are participating in the 2013 WBC: Xander Bogaerts, Eddie Rosario, and Jameson Taillon.\nPool B.\nNote: All player birthplaces are in Australia unless indicated otherwise.\nPool D.\nNote: All player birthplaces are in Canada unless indicated otherwise.\n\nNote: All player birthplaces are in Mexico unless indicated otherwise.\n\nNote: All player birthplaces are in the United States."

        "title": "Victorian PGA Championship",
        "text": "The Victorian PGA Championship is a golf tournament played in Victoria, Australia. It has been part of the PGA Tour of Australasia each season since 2009. It is the oldest of the state professional championships, having been first held in 1922.\nHistory.\nThe first Victorian Professional Championship was held in November 1922 and was open to any professional in Australia and New Zealand. It was a 72-hole stroke-play event with 36 holes played at Royal Melbourne on 6 November and 36 holes played at Victoria Golf Club two day later. It attracted a number of New South Wales players as well as the professionals from Victoria. Billy Iles and Dan Soutar, one of the NSW players, were tied on 158 after the first day's play. Soutar won after the second day with a score of 313, a stroke ahead of Tom Howard, another NSW professional, with Iles dropping back to third place.\nThe 1923 championship followed the same format as in 1922. Arthur Le Fevre, the Royal Melbourne professional. led by 3 strokes after the first day but, with two rounds of 74 of the second day, pulled away and won by 14 strokes. Rowley Banks and Charlie Campbell, from NSW, tied for second place. The only change in format in 1924 was the order of the courses, with the Victoria course played first. A number of NSW players were expected but none appeared. Rowley Banks won by a stroke, with a score of 310. In 1925, the first day's play was at Kingston Heath Golf Club, with the second day at Royal Melbourne. Ted Smith, from Tasmania, trailed after the first day, but with rounds of 73 and 76 at Royal Melbourne, won by 8 strokes.\nFrom 1926 the championship was played at a single venue. Ted Smith, now a Victorian professional, won again in 1926, at Royal Melbourne, with some good scoring in difficult conditions on the second day. Smith was in the United States at the time of the 1927 championship and didn't defend his title at Metropolitan Golf Club. Horace Boorer won the title by two strokes. The 1928 championship at Kingston Heath was won by Rufus Stewart from South Australia in a close contest with Billy Bolger from New South Wales.\nThe championship became a match-play event in 1929. There was a 36-hole stroke-play qualifying day after which the leading 8 played 36-hole match-play. From 1933 the number of qualifiers was increased to 16, extending the event to 5 days. Defending champion, Rufus Stewart, reached final in 1929, but lost 6&amp;5 to Reg Jupp. There were a number of two-time winners in the 1930s. George Naismith won in 1932 and 1934 beating Horace Boorer both times, Boorer losing three finals in a row. Ted Naismith won in 1935 and 1936, while Charlie Connors won in 1937 and 1938. Ted Naismith reached his third successive final in 1937, losing to Connors. In 1939, Connors himself reached his third final in a row, but lost to Martin Smith.\nThe 1946 and 1947 championships were played as 72-hole stroke-play events. Eric Cremin won them both, but my small margins. In 1946 he tied with another New South Wales professional, Norman Von Nida. There was an 18-hole playoff with Cremin winning by 3 strokes, 70 to 73. The following year he won by a stroke from Denis Denehey, having trailed by 3 shots after three rounds. In 1948 the event returned to its pre-war format, with 16 qualifiers on the first day, playing four days of match-play. Cremin did not compete, the event clashing with the New South Wales Close Championship. Ossie Pickworth led the qualifying by 9 strokes and won the championship, beating Sam Walsh 10&amp;9 in the final. Cremin won his third title in 1949, beating Jack Harris in final. Harris had defeated Pickworth in the first match-play round. Harris reached the final again in 1950 beating Pickworth in the final. The match was decided at the 37th hole, the only match-play final that went to extra holes. Martin Smith won his second title in 1951, 12 years after his first. Peter Thomson won the championship in 1952 and 1953. In 1952 he beat Pickworth in a close final, but he won the 1953 final against Denis Denehey by a record score, 12 &amp; 11. Pickworth had his second and third wins in 1954 and 1955, beating Harris on both occasions.\nIn 1956 the championship became a 72-hole stroke-play event. Ossie Pickworth won his third successive title and fourth in all, finishing two strokes ahead of Jack Harris. Harris won in 1957 and 1959 but was beaten by Peter Mills in 1958, who won by 6 strokes. For some years the prize money on offer had not attracted out-of-state professionals, but in 1960 three local businesses sponsored the event, which had prize money of £1,200, attracting a number of the leading New South Wales professionals. However, Harris retained his title and won the £400 first prize, with Kel Nagle a stroke behind in second place. Prize money dropped to £500 in 1961 but most of the leading Australians played, with the event played on the Monday and Tuesday after the Australian Open, which was played at Victoria Golf Club, finishing on the Saturday. Harris won for the fifth time, two ahead of the Australian Open winner, Frank Phillips. The prize money was maintained at £500 up to 1965. Three New South Wales professionals won this period, Kel Nagle in 1962, Bruce Devlin in 1964 and Alan Murray in 1965, with Harris winning for the sixth time in 1963.\nFrom 1966 to 1976 the championship returned to being a largely domestic event. In 1969, Jack Harris came close to winning his seventh title. He was tied with Geoff Parslow but lost the 18-hole playoff by 8 strokes. In 1977 the championship was incorporated into the Albury-Wodonga Classic, which had prize money of A$15,000. It was won by Vaughan Somers from Queensland. In 1978 and 1979 the event was known as the Garden State Victorian PGA Championship and had prize money of A$50,000. The American Lanny Wadkins won in 1978, with Ian Stanley winning in 1979 after a playoff. Loss of sponsorship meant that prize money dropped to A$15,000 in 1980, below the minimum for a tour event. A full tour event was planned for 1981 but dropped because of lack of sponsorship, eventually being replaced by an event at Warrnambool, with smaller prize money. The 1982 event was also a non-tour event, reduced to 54 holes with prize money of A$10,000.\nAn event was planned at Woodlands in 1983 but was cancelled due to lack and sponsorship. The event was moved to Warrnambool, who had already secured enough prize money for a full tour event. The event, which eventually had prize money of A$40,000, was won by Vaughan Somers, his second win in the championship. The event remained at Warrnambool for a further three years. Prize money rose to A$50,000 in 1984, Wayne Riley winning after a playoff against Ian Baker-Finch. Rodger Davis won in 1985, 7 strokes ahead of the field. Prize money doubled to A$100,000 in 1986, with Wayne Smith winning by 2 strokes. The Warrnambool event was cancelled in 1987 because of the lack of TV coverage and the championship was played at the end of December, as part of the 36-hole Carpet Call pro-am. The event returned at Keysborough in January 1989 as a full tour event, with prize money of A$100,000. David Ecob won by a stroke from Peter Senior.\nThe event was played over 54 holes from 1991 to 1993 before returning to the 72-hole format in 1994 as part of the new second-tier Foundation Tour, Stuart Appleby winning the event after a playoff. The event later became part of the Von Nida Tour before the second-tier events were added to the main tour in 2009. Since 2000 both Gareth Paddison and Ashley Hall have won the championship twice. From 2002 to 2021 total prize money was in the range A$100,000 to A$137,500, but was increased to A$250,000 for the centenary championship in 2022."

With the win, the Netherlands clinched at least a three-way tie for the two second-round berths, and its favorable position with respect to tiebreakers meant that it was assured of advancing regardless of the outcome of the final game between Chinese Taipei and South Korea.\nSouth Korea 3, Chinese Taipei 2.\nSouth Korea went into the final game needing not only to win (which would cause a three-way tie for the two second-round berths) but to win by at least five runs in order to have a chance of advancing on tiebreakers. Although Chinese Taipei lost its 2−0 lead in Korea's three-run eighth-inning rally, and then lost the game, they emerged as winners of the pool and of the second-round berth since Korea's margin of victory was only one run."

For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.)."

        "text": "The Forty Plus Cycling Club is a cycling club for adult cyclists in England, particularly active in the South East. It was founded in 1951 as a nonprofit organization and had 816 members in 2014.\nThe club is affiliated to the CTC and British Cycling.\nWhilst other cycle clubs organise their rides mostly at weekends, the Forty Plus Cycling Club meets the needs of cyclists who are retired, unemployed or working shifts by offering its rides on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.\nSections of the club in Bedfordshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Northamptonshire, Surrey and Sussex each organise rides between one and three times a week.\nActivities.\nThe Forty Plus Cycling Club promotes sociable cycling activities for older men and women. Activities cater for a wide range of cycling abilities with members aged from 18 to over 100.\nThe club undertakes some adventurous tours, including a 7 day circuit of London.\nSection rides.\n16 sections organise over 20 led rides and meets every week throughout the year and on most days of the week.\nOpen Events.\nSpecial events for the whole club are held between May and September. These are also open to non-members:\nSignpost Magazine.\nSignpost is the quarterly club magazine sent free to members. It includes articles, drawings and photographs submitted by members as well as news and details of events.\nNon-members may download back issues of Signpost from the club website.\nLibrary.\nThe club maintains an extensive library of cycling publications, including books on cycle touring, racing, reference books, biographies, guidebooks and maps.\nHistory.\nThe Forty Plus Cycling Club was founded by Cecil Cooke in 1951. Cecil Cooke was an enthusiastic club cyclist who was President of the Hertfordshire DA of the CTC, from soon after its inception in 1928 to May 1937. He was also the first secretary of the Veterans Time Trials Association (VTTA) established in 1943. The objects of the club set out in the original handbook were \"to promote cycling fixtures of a sociable character in the London Home Counties area and to provide for the interests of members in such other ways as may be decided upon\". The annual subscription was five shillings (25p).\nThe club was originally based in London and rides were at the weekend. In addition to the Sunday rides, there was an active programme of social events on Saturdays in the autumn and winter. After a few years of rides from the four quarters of London, new sections were formed in the various parts of southern and eastern England, extending as far as Bournemouth in the south and East Northants in the north. In 1978, a section was started in Northern Ireland.\nAround 1967 day time Tuesday and Thursday rides were started in Hertfordshire and Essex to cater for the growing number of retired members. Over the years, mid-week rides gradually replaced Sunday rides as the mainstay of the club.\nA series of open events was introduced in 2011 to mark the club's diamond jubilee and this featured in an interview on Phoenix FM.\nIn January 2013 the club was featured in a 4-page article in Cycling Active published by IPC Media, which stated that \"Founded in 1951, the Forty Plus Cycling Club caters, as its name would suggest, for riders of a more elegant vintage. It’s a national club, albeit at its most active in the south of England, and it caters for riders from a variety of backgrounds...\" and proclaimed that \"the Bradley Wiggins Effect hasn't just been confined to young racers keen to emulate their hero\".\nSome sections of the club go on cycle tours abroad, as a local reporter found when he joined a Southend Section day ride in the autumn of 2014. The article in the Rayleigh Review describes the day ride and mentions their 500 mile cycle tour from Krakow to Berlin that summer."

        "text": "The SIU Edwardsville Cougars men's basketball team represents Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) in the Ohio Valley Conference of NCAA Division I basketball. The Cougars play their home matches at the Sam M. Vadalabene Center located in the SIUE core campus in Edwardsville, Illinois.\nHistory.\nThe SIUE basketball program first entered competition on November 23, 1967, under the leadership of Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Harry Gallatin. The newborn program had no scholarships, inadequate facilities, and very little money to work with. Home games were played at the Shurtleff College gymnasium in Alton, usually with crowds of fewer than a dozen fans in attendance. Gallatin departed as the program's coach after three years (while remaining as athletic director and golf coach for many years) with a record of 19–31.\nGallatin was succeeded by Jim Dudley, who would head the program for eleven years, compiling a 146–143 record. During Dudley's tenure, home games moved to the gymnasium at Edwardsville High School (now Lincoln Middle School) which was located a short distance from the SIUE campus.\nDudley was followed by Tom Pugliese, whose two years saw a record of 17–40 and brought about NCAA sanctions, resulting in the university administration's almost unheard of action of suspending of the program for the 1983–84 season.\nLarry Graham resurrected the program in 1984, as the program finally got a home of its own, moving into the new Sam M. Vadalabene Center on campus. Graham was the most successful of the Cougars' coaches, earning a record of 147–84, with three NCAA Division II tournament appearances in his eight seasons.\nAfter Graham, Jack Margenthaler had limited success, achieving a record of 112–150 in ten years.\nSuccess returned to Cougars basketball during Marty Simmons' five years at the helm. Simmons's teams went 88–59, making the NCAA Division II tournament in 2005 and not only returning in 2006, but earning a spot in that season's Elite Eight in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nWhen Simmons returned to his \"alma mater\", as head coach at the University of Evansville, SIUE named long-time Missouri Valley Conference assistant coach Lennox Forrester to be the programs' seventh head coach. Following his first season, the Cougars began the transition from Division II to Division I and membership in the Ohio Valley Conference. Although the Cougars had losing seasons during their transition, they have become more competitive with each season. Through Forrester's first five seasons, his teams finished only 50–92, but his contract was extended following the 2011–12 season.\nOn March 10, 2015, it was announced that the contracts of Forrester and his entire staff would not be renewed and that a national search for a new head coach was being launched. On April 3, it was announced that California assistant coach Jon Harris, an Edwardsville native, had been named the 8th head coach in SIUE Basketball history.\nOn March 11, 2019, SIUE announced that coach Jon Harris' contract had not been renewed after a four-year record of 31 wins and 88 losses. However, Harris' full staff of assistant coaches Brian Barone, Charles \"Bubba\" Wells, and Mike Waldo and Director of Operations Casey Wyllie were all retained, and Barone was later named as interim head coach.\nAfter serving as the interim head coach throughout the 2019 offseason, Barone was officially named head coach of the Cougars on November 13, 2019, after a 1–2 start to the season.\nThe Cougars have improved steadily over the first three years of Barone's tenure as head coach, posting win totals of eight in 2019–20, nine in 2020–21 and 11 in 2021–22. The 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons were both affected heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic. This began with the team's December 13th game at Northwestern cancelled. The Cougars returned to play with a 69–65 win over Morehead State to open OVC play on December 18, however, it would be the last game SIUE would play for 33 days. Following the game against Morehead State, the Cougars had nine consecutive games postponed due to a COVID-19 outbreak on the team. SIUE would go on to play 18 games in 37 days to finish the season. SIUE qualified for the OVC Tournament, losing their opening round game to Belmont 78-61. The following year, SIUE had five games postponed due to COVID-19 concerns, once again qualifying for the OVC Tournament. SIUE lost its first-round matchup to Tennessee State.\nAll-Americans.\n\"Reference:\"\nWhile the SIUE men's basketball has not seen the success of some other Cougars programs, two players were honored as NCAA Division II All-Americans:\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Cougars appeared in the NCAA Division II Tournament five times.

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Frederick V",
        "text": "An equestrian statue of King Frederick V of Denmark stands in the center of Amalienborg Square, Copenhagen, framed by the four symmetrical wings of the Amalienborg palace. The statue portrays the king in classic attire, crowned with laurels and with his hand outstretched, holding a baton. Commissioned by the Danish East India Company, it was designed in Neoclassical style by Jacques Saly in 1768 and was cast in bronze in 1771. The apparent dignity and tranquility in the depiction of the king is typical of Danish representations of monarchs. It is considered to be one of the notable equestrian monuments of its time.\nBackground.\nIn 1752 Saly was commissioned to create a sculpture of Frederick V on horseback, to be placed in the center of the courtyard of Amalienborg Palace. The equestrian statue was commissioned by Adam Gottlob Moltke, head of the Asiatic Company, as a gift to the king. But while Moltke’s company offered to finance the statue, it was the government who chose the sculptor. Count Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff wrote to the Danish Legation secretary to the French Court in Paris, Joachim Wasserschlebe, to find a suitable French sculptor. Sculptor Edmé Bouchardon rejected the offer, but suggested Saly, who wanted a significant sum for the model and free housing in Copenhagen. The government concluded the contract with Saly in Spring 1752, but because of conflict with ongoing projects Saly did not arrive in Denmark until 8 October 1753, bringing with him his parents, his two sisters, and at least one assistant. Work began on the monument that same year.\nSaly showed the king the first sketch of the equestrian statue on 4 December 1754. The king approved a sketch for the whole monument in August 1755, after which Saly began a thorough study of horses from the king’s stalls. This resulted in a small model, which he showed the king in November 1758. Casts of this model are found in both the collection of the Academy and the State Collection, now the Danish National Gallery. After having set up an appropriate studio, Saly carried out the work on the large model of the equestrian statue from 1761 to 1763. The plaster cast was presented to the Academy members on 3 February 1764. The king also saw this model. Preparations for the bronze casting took four more years, and Frenchman Pierre Gors did the casting on 2 March 1768. The year 1768 is officially considered the statue’s completion date.\nThe statue.\nThe bronze was cast on 2 March 1768 by Frenchman Pierre Gors and weighed some 22 tons. Another three years were spent on finishing the work, which was inaugurated in 1771. Including the base, the statue reaches a height of almost . Saly reported he had been inspired by the \nequestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome as well as by Giambologna's equestrian Henry IV on the Pont Neuf in Paris. But perhaps his greatest inspiration was Edmé Bouchardon's Louis XV (destroyed during the French Revolution) in Place Louis XV, now the Place de la Concorde. It had just been completed when Saly left for Denmark.\nSaly first modelled a lifelike portrait of the King. He made a few small bronze castings, the last of which was approved by Frederik V in 1755. Saly then went on to study horses in the royal stables. In 1758, he prepared a model about a meter in height, which the king applauded. Copies still exist in Copenhagen's museums. The King's portrait, where he is depicted as a Roman emperor capped with laurels, has however been lost.\nEngraving and medals.\nJohan Martin Preisler made a large engraving of the equestrian statue (1769) in commemoration of its completion. The Danish Asiatic Company cast two medallions, one by Johan Henrik Wolff and the other by Daniel Jensen Adzer. The base for the statue was delivered first, in 1770, while the unveiling of the statue itself finally took place in the courtyard at Amalienborg Palace on 1 August 1771, five years after the King’s death in 1766. It commands the site still. The statue's base was renovated in 1997–1998.\nDanish Culture Canon.\nIn the 21st century, the Danish Culture Canon's committee for the visual arts pointed out that the statue, which took 14 years to complete, cost more than Amalienborg's four palatial buildings which surround it. It was considered to be the jewel of that exquisite environment, an entity which could only be created at the time. It has been preserved unaltered to this day, unlike many similar bronzes, which were melted down for weapons. The painting \"Amalienborg Square, Copenhagen\" by Vilhelm Hammershøi places the statue in a central, monumental role."

        "text": "Paris Saint-Germain Handball (PSG) is a French professional handball club founded in 1941, and based in the city of Paris in France. The club is the handball department of Paris Saint-Germain.\nPSG play in the highest tier of French handball, the LNH Division 1. Their home ground for LNH matches is Stade Pierre de Coubertin, which has a seating capacity of 3,400 spectators. For EHF Champions League matches, the club play at Halle Georges Carpentier, which has a seating capacity of 4,500 spectators.\nInitially called Patriotes d'Asnières (1941–1942), the club has gone through several name changes: Asnières Sports (1942–1987), Paris-Racing-Asnières (1987–1988), Paris-Asnières (1988–1992), PSG-Asnières (1992–2002), and Paris Handball (2002–2012). After being bought by Paris Saint-Germain owners Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) in 2012, the club became Paris Saint-Germain Handball.\nSince its inception, the club has won 23 titles. Domestically, Paris SG have clinched 10 LNH Division 1 titles, six French Cups, three Coupes de la Ligue, a record four and two LNH Division 2 titles. They are the only club in French handball to have ever won all their matches in LNH Division 1 in a season, which they did in the 2021–22 season. In international club handball, the capital side finished runners-up in the 2016–17 edition of the Champions League. PSG also have a reserve team that currently play in the , which serves as the . They have played in Nationale 1 since 2017–18, after clinching the title and winning promotion during the .\nHistory.\nFirst titles (1941–2012).\nThe Parisian club was founded in 1941. Initially, it took the name of Patriotes d'Asnières before becoming Asnières Sports one year later. Asnières Sports was presided by Christian Picard, whose son Gérard Picard took over during the 1975–1976 season and remained president until 2003.\nIn 1987, the club's management succeeded in convincing the Paris City Council to partner Asnières Sports and create a major handball team in the capital. This resulted in the Hauts-de-Seine team moving to Paris and being renamed Paris-Racing-Asnières then Paris-Asnières. Relegated in 1989, Paris-Asnières immediately bounced back to the top flight in 1990 after winning the D2 title. At the time, the club's most notable players were future French internationals Jackson Richardson and Patrick Cazal.\nIn 1992, the club came under the management of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, a partnership that lasted 10 years. This led to another name change, and Paris-Asnières became PSG-Asnières. PSG-Asnières finished second in the LNH Division 1 during the and then reached the French Cup final in 2001, losing to Montpellier.\nDuring that time, PSG-Asnières managed to attract several international players such as Stéphane Stoecklin, Denis Lathoud, Gaël Monthurel, Nenad Peruničić and Olivier Girault. The latter set up home in Paris in 1999, playing for the club until 2008 and then coaching the team until 2011.\nUnder yet another name, Paris Handball began 2002 with new club owner Louis Nicollin. During the next decade, the club played in the EHF Champions League during the 2005–06 season, and won its first major trophy in 2007 with star player Kévynn Nyokas. Paris Handball registered a over .\nBut there were tough times too. At the end of the , the club was relegated to . Paris Handball won the the very next season and rejoined the top clubs. In 2012, the team narrowly avoided relegation in the last round of play.\nDomestic dominance (2012–).\nAfter being bought by Paris Saint-Germain Football Club owners Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) in 2012, the club became Paris Saint-Germain Handball. Under the initiative of Nasser Al-Khelaifi, a new management and playing team was assembled. Jean-Claude Blanc was named general manager, Philippe Gardent signed as first-team manager, and a host of international stars arrived at the French capital, including Didier Dinart, Luc Abalo, Samuel Honrubia, Mikkel Hansen, Marko Kopljar, José Manuel Sierra and Antonio García.\nIn the 2012–13 season, PSG claimed their maiden league success, which also meant the club secured a spot in the EHF Champions League. However, PSG were denied the double by Montpellier in the French Cup final.\nBig-name signings kept coming in the 2013–14 season with the arrivals of Daniel Narcisse, Igor Vori, Jakov Gojun, Fahrudin Melić and Gábor Császár. PSG reached the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time in its history, but failed to keep up the pace with Dunkerque in the league. Despite this, the season finished on a high note, thanks to a victory in the against Chambéry, adding a second national cup trophy to the club's honours.\nIn the 2014–15 season, new manager Zvonimir Serdarušić and star signing Nikola Karabatić led the capital club to its second league title following a nail-biting battle for top spot against Montpellier. PSG claimed the trophy on the last day of the season, after a win over . The league crown rounded off a domestic treble, going alongside the French Cup and the that they had won after beating Nantes and Dunkerque, respectively. On the European stage, PSG's hopes were dashed, for a second time, by Veszprém in the Champions League semifinals.\nPSG continued its winning ways in the 2015–16 season by claiming a second French Super Cup and a third league title. However, the crowning moment was reaching the Champions League Final4 for the first time in its history. Along the way, the club downed THW Kiel at the Sparkassen-Arena, where the German side had been undefeated for four years; topped its group for the first time ever; and trumped Kiel in the third-place play-off. Additionally, Mikkel Hansen set a new record for goals in a Champions League season, with no fewer than 141 strikes to his name.\nIn the 2021–22 season they finished off LNH Division 1 with 60 points on 30 matches, being the only team ever in the french league to achieve that.\nIdentity.\nParent club Paris Saint-Germain represent both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. As a result, red, blue and white are the club's traditional colours. The red and blue are Parisian colours, a nod to revolutionary figures Lafayette and Jean Sylvain Bailly, and the white is a symbol of French royalty and Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\nOn the club's crest, the Eiffel Tower in red and the blue background represent Paris, while the fleur de lys in white is a hint to the coat of arms of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The fleur de lys is a royal symbol as well and recalls that French King Louis XIV was born in the town. Throughout its history, PSG have brandished several different crests, but all of them have featured the club's three historical colours. Likewise, PSG's most iconic shirts have been predominantly red, blue or white, with the remaining two colours included as well. The club's official mascot, Germain the Lynx, also sports PSG's traditional colours.\nGrounds.\nStadium.\nThe Stade Pierre de Coubertin, with a seating capacity of 3,400 spectators, serves as PSG's home stadium for LNH Division 1 matches. For EHF Champions League games, on the other hand, the club uses the Halle Georges Carpentier as its home venue. It has a seating capacity of 4,500 spectators.\nTraining facilities.\nCampus PSG is the training ground of Paris Saint-Germain Handball. Owned and financed by the club, the venue will bring together PSG's football (male and female), handball and judo teams, as well as the football and handball academies. The handball division have their own specific areas and facilities spread over 4,510 m2 of space, including two fields, a stand with a capacity of 250 spectators, fitness rooms, recovery areas, staff offices, and meeting rooms.\nSupporters.\nBetween 2010 and 2016, with the impossibility for fan groups to support parent club Paris Saint-Germain (men's football team) at home or away, the PSG faithful turned to Paris Saint-Germain Féminine, and to a lesser extent to the Paris Saint-Germain Academy sides, being the very rare case of fan groups supporting their club's women's football team. Liberté Pour les Abonnés and Nautecia, which were among several groups that reunited Boulogne and Auteuil supporters, were behind this initiative. PSG ultras have also occasionally attended big matches of the club's handball team ever since it was bought by PSG owners Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) in 2012.\nOwnership and finances.\nTamim bin Hamad Al Thani, ruler of Qatar, bought 70% of parent club Paris Saint-Germain through state-owned shareholding organization Qatar Sports Investments (QSI). Colony Capital (29%) and Butler (1%) remained minority shareholders. In March 2012, QSI purchased the remaining 30% stake to become PSG's sole shareholder, valuing the club at €100m. PSG thus became one of the wealthiest clubs in the world. Paris Saint-Germain Handball (previously called Paris Handball) were then bought by PSG owners QSI in 2012.\nIn late June 2019, Paris Saint-Germain announced a long-term contract extension with kit manufacturer Nike, which is now one of European football's most lucrative and the biggest sponsorship agreement in the club's history. PSG are tied to the American brand until 2032 and will more than triple their previous €25m deal with an annual figure in excess of €80 million. PSG said the new Nike deal will cover the men's and women's football teams, as well as their handball outfit.\nHonours.\nEuropean record.\nNote All matches ending with a 10–0 or 5–5 results were assessed by the EHF."

European Championships 2012 in Bucharest were the joint twenty-three European kickboxing championships held by the W.A.K.O. organization arranged by the Romanian Full-Contact Martial Arts Federation (F.R.A.M.C.) president Dorel Bulearcă. The first event was held the previous month in Ankara, Turkey. It was the first W.A.K.O. event to be held in Bucharest and Romania and involved over 550 amateur men and women from 35 countries across Europe.\nThere were four styles on offer at Bucharest: Full-Contact, Semi-Contact, Light-Contact and Musical Forms. Only one competitor per weight division were allowed to participate in the first three, while Musical Forms was allowed two maximum per country.\nThe top nation by the end of the championships was Russia, with Italy in second and Hungary in third. The winners of the Full-Contact and Semi-Contact events qualified for the World Combat Games 2013.\nThe event was held over five days at the Polyvalent Hall in Bucharest, Romania, starting on Tuesday, 27 November and ending on Saturday, 1 December 2012.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where the contestants can throw punches and kicks with full power at legal targets above the waist. Victories are usually gained via a point's decision or by referee stoppage and as with most other forms of amateur kickboxing, various head and body protection must be worn.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is the least physical of the contact kickboxing styles available at W.A.K.O. events. It involves the participants throwing controlled strikes at targets above the waist, with point's scored on the basis of speed and technique with power prohibited. Despite the less physical nature all contestants must wear head and various body protection.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing that is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi-Contact and is often seen as a transition between the two. Contestants score points on the basis of speed and technique over brute force although stoppages can occur, although as with other amateur forms head and body protection must be worn. Unfortunately, it is often in the shadow of the full contact styles.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms is a type of non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques. Unlike Full, Semi and Light-Contact kickboxing there were no weight divisions, only male and female competitions and competitors were allowed to compete in more than one category with some countries having than one athlete in each category. The men and women at Bucharest competed in four different styles explained below:"

Each team played the other three teams once, with the top two teams advancing to Pool 2.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPool D MVP: Michael Saunders\nResults.\nCanada 10, Mexico 3.\nBrawl.\nThe Canada-Mexico game was marred by a bench-clearing brawl in the top of the ninth inning. Team Canada, who had a sizeable 9-3 lead at that point, began the frame with a Chris Robinson bunt single. Though bunting for a hit would customarily be against baseball etiquette with a large lead, the fact that run differential would be used in tie-breaking procedures made the play more of a strategic move. Still, Team Mexico took the play as a slight, with television cameras catching third baseman Luis Cruz motioning to pitcher Arnold Leon to bean the next Canadian batter, Rene Tosoni. Leon's first two pitches were thrown inside to Tosoni, neither of which made contact. Both benches were warned after the second pitch, but nonetheless, Leon threw at Tosoni a third time, finally hitting him. Tosoni then walked towards the mound, with both benches emptying to incite the brawl. After the fighting had died down, with both teams returning to their benches, Mexican fans from behind the Canadian dugout began to get involved, with a fan throwing a water bottle that hit Canadian pitching coach Denis Boucher in the head. Shortstop Cale Iorg responded by firing the bottle back into the stands. Seven players total were ejected, and no disciplinary measures such as suspensions were taken following the game.\nUnited States 6, Italy 2.\nThe United States went ahead of Italy in the fifth inning on a grand slam hit by third baseman David Wright and held on to win the game. Wright's home run was seen as a turning point of lackluster play by the US up until that point.\nUnited States 9, Canada 4.\nTeam USA and Canada went toe to toe until outfielder Adam Jones doubled home two runs in the eighth inning off of Canada's Jimmy Henderson. Jones later scored on a single by Shane Victorino and the USA tacked on four more run in the ninth inning, punctuated by a three-run double by Eric Hosmer. The United States went on to win the game 9-4, earning them the Pool D victory and a berth to the second round in Miami, as Canada was eliminated from the tournament for the third time."

        "text": "Gregory James Campbell (born December 17, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre and current Assistant General Manager of the Florida Panthers. He was drafted by the Panthers in the third round, 67th overall, in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. Campbell is the son of former NHL player and current NHL Director of Hockey Operations Colin Campbell.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nBorn in London, Ontario, Campbell grew up in nearby Tillsonburg, playing the majority of his minor hockey with the Tillsonburg Tornados BB teams of the OMHA Southern Counties League and the AAA Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs of the Alliance Pavilion League until Minor Bantam. He played in the 1996 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the New York Rangers minor ice hockey team.\nCampbell was drafted by the Plymouth Whalers in the sixth round, 102nd overall, in the 1999 OHL Bantam Supplemental Draft after playing the 1998–99 season with the Aylmer Aces Jr.B. club.\nCampbell was traded by Plymouth on August 2, 2002, to the Kitchener Rangers, along with a third-round draft pick, in exchange for Ryan Ramsey, Gary Klapowski and a second-round pick. According to the Rangers, Campbell was brought in to \"fill the need for a strong forward to park in the crease area to play alongside Derek Roy on the Rangers top unit and especially on the powerplay, filling a gap left by graduating power forwards Jeff Szwez and John Osborne, who combined for 42 goals for the Rangers last season.\"\nCampbell was a late invitee to the World Junior Championships camp, joining Rangers teammates Steve Eminger and Derek Roy at the camp. Campbell, along with Roy and Eminger (as well as former Bruins teammate Daniel Paille), was ultimately selected to play for Team Canada at the 2003 World Junior Championships, where they won the silver medal, falling to Russia in the tournament final.\nThrough 55 games for Kitchener, Campbell racked up 23 goals and 33 assists for 56 points playing alongside Derek Roy. In 21 playoff games, Campbell scored 15 goals and picked up four assists for 19 points with 34 penalties in minutes, leading his team to contend for the Memorial Cup in 2003. Campbell recorded one goal and six assists for seven points in four games in the tournament. He was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star Team along with Derek Roy, Mike Richards, Steve Eminger, Doug O'Brien and Scott Dickie. Campbell was also awarded the Ed Chynoweth Trophy as the tournament's leading scorer and the George Parsons Trophy as the most sportsmanlike player.\nProfessional.\nFlorida Panthers.\nCampbell was drafted 67th overall by the Florida Panthers in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. He played two NHL games in 2003–04, but did not register a point in the contests. He scored his first goal in the 2005–06 NHL season in a 4–3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens against goaltender Yann Danis. \nBoston Bruins.\nOn June 22, 2010, Campbell was traded by the Panthers, along with Nathan Horton, to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Dennis Wideman and a first-round draft pick (15th overall) in 2010 and a third-round pick in 2011.\nIn the 2010–11 season, Campbell set a career high in penalty minutes (93) and tied for a career high in goals (13). During the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, he centred the Bruins' top penalty killing unit, which notably neutralized the potent Vancouver Canucks' power play in the Stanley Cup Finals, limiting them to just two power play goals through the seven-game series. On June 15, 2011, Campbell won the Stanley Cup with the Bruins. At the end of the next off-season, on June 12, 2012, he re-signed a three-year, $4.8 million contract extension.\nOn June 5, 2013, during Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Campbell suffered a broken right fibula after throwing himself in front of an Evgeni Malkin slapshot during a crucial penalty kill against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Campbell regained his footing, however, and despite being unable to put any pressure on his right leg, he remained on the ice for more than a minute. In doing so, he helped kill off the Penguins power play before painstakingly skating himself to the bench. While Campbell exited the Ice, Bruins fans were heard to be chanting \"Campbell, Campbell!\" in support of the beloved Bruin. The Bruins went on to win the game 2–1 in double overtime, ultimately progressing to the Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks. They would lose to Chicago in six games, but Campbell did not play any in any Finals games due to his injury.\nDespite concerns, Campbell was ready to go for the 2013–14 season opener for the Bruins. Campbell stayed in his usual role, centering the fourth line (nicknamed the Merlot Line) between Daniel Paille and Shawn Thornton. Campbell would play in all 82 games for the Bruins en route to a Presidents' Trophy, scoring 8 goals and 13 assists for 21 points.

        "text": "Anthony Barr (born March 18, 1992) is an American football linebacker who is a free agent. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins from 2010 to 2013, earning consensus All-American honors in 2013. He was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round, ninth overall of the 2014 NFL draft.\nBarr was an offensive player his first two years at UCLA, playing running back, wide receiver and tight end. He struggled as a running back, and switched to linebacker during his junior year, at which position he was named a first-team All-Pac-12 selection and to the CBSSports.com All-America second-team. As a senior Barr received the Lott IMPACT Award after leading the team in sacks.\nIn 2014, Barr's first season playing professional football in the NFL, he was named National Football Conference (NFC) Defensive Player of the Week for Week 8 and selected for the Pro Football Focus All-NFC North Team. His rookie season was cut short due to a knee injury. Following that season he made four consecutive Pro Bowl appearances (20152018). In the spring of 2019, he signed a five-year extension of his contract with the Vikings.\nEarly years.\nBarr was born in South Bend, Indiana, but raised in Los Angeles, where he attended Loyola High School in the Pico-Union neighborhood. He was a letterman in football and track, and was an All-State selection at running back for the Loyola Cubs football team after rushing for 1,890 yards and 20 touchdowns as a junior. However, he missed virtually all of his senior season after breaking his ankle in the September, and was also unable to participate in the 2010 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, to which he was invited.\nBarr also lettered four seasons in track and field. At the 2009 CIF Southern Prelims, he earned 11th-place finishes in both the 100 meter (11.01 s) and the 200 meter (22.40 s) dashes. He took silver in the 200 meter dash at the 2009 Mission League Championships, recording a personal-best time of 21.86 seconds.\nRecruiting.\nRegarded as a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Barr was listed as the No. 8 prospect and the No. 5 athlete out of the state of California. According to Scout.com, he was ranked as the No. 100 national prospect and the No. 10 outside linebacker. He was also rated as the No. 1 athlete by MaxPreps. With scholarship offers from dozens of schools, Barr narrowed his decision down to Notre Dame and UCLA, before choosing the Bruins on January 21, 2010.\nCollege career.\nBarr was an offensive player his first two years at the University of California, Los Angeles, playing running back, wide receiver and tight end. On October 21, 2010, against the Oregon Ducks, Barr made his first start, and he made 1 catch for 17 yards. In 2011, he caught an 11-yard touchdown pass against the Houston Cougars. Although he started 12 games on offense in both years, he ran the ball 15 times for 54 yards. Barr struggled at being a running back, which almost caused him to quit football. However, prior to his junior season in 2012, he switched to linebacker.\nDuring Barr's first year as a linebacker, he recorded 13.5 sacks, 21.5 tackles for loss and 83 tackles. His 13.5 sacks were the second-highest total in the nation (behind only Georgia's Jarvis Jones). He was named a first-team All-Pac-12 Conference and was selected to the CBSSports.com College Football All-America second-team. In Week 11, Barr was named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week after his performance against the Washington State Cougars. At the team's annual awards banquet, Barr was named the Most Valuable Player on defense (Henry R. \"Red\" Sanders Award). In a November 2012 game against the USC Trojans, Barr sacked quarterback Matt Barkley, who suffered a season-ending shoulder injury.\nIn six games, Barr made more than 7 tackles, including nine against Stanford, eight in the Pac-12 Football Championship game, and nine in the Holiday Bowl against Baylor. Despite being touted as a potential first-round draft choice in the 2013 NFL draft, Barr decided to return to UCLA for his senior season. On July 8, 2013, Barr was ranked 37th as a possibility for the Maxwell Award and 3rd as a candidate for the Chuck Bednarik Award. On July 15, 2013, Barr was named as a candidate for the Butkus Award and the Lombardi Award. He was also named to the 2013 preseason All-American team.\nBarr was named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week after week 2 of the 2013 season, a 41–21 win over Nebraska on September 14, 2013. He was also the Walter Camp Football Foundation player of the week on defense. For the 2013 regular season, Barr had 62 tackles, 20 for a loss (ranked 9th) and has forced five fumbles (fifth best) and recovered four (second in the nation). He led the team with 10 sacks for 66 yards and was rewarded with the Lott IMPACT Award. Barr is in sixth place on the all-time school list for tackles for loss (41.5) and is tied for sixth on the school's all-time list for sacks (23.5).

        "text": "The men's eight competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles took place at the Long Beach Marine Stadium. It was held from 10 to 13 August. There were 8 boats (72 competitors) from 8 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the United States, the nation's fourth consecutive and sixth overall victory; the Americans had won every time they competed (missing 1908 and 1912). Silver went to Italy, that nation's second medal in the men's eight after a bronze in 1924. Canada repeated as bronze medalists, stretching their podium streak in the event to three Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nGreat Britain and the United States were the dominant nations in the event, with the nations winning all seven prior Olympic men's eight competitions between them. The United States held a 5–2 edge and the reigning crown, having beaten the British team in the final in 1928 to take their third straight gold. The United States was again represented by the University of California, Berkeley (the 1928 winners), while Great Britain was now represented by the Leander Club. The Leander Club had won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1929 and 1932.\nBrazil, Japan, and New Zealand each made their debut in the event. Canada, Great Britain, and the United States each made their sixth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nThe 1932 competition had fewer boats than previous competitions and once again allowed more than two boats per race; this resulted in the event shrinking from 7 rounds in 1928 to 3 rounds. There were two main rounds (semifinals and a final), with one repechage round.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe winners of each heat qualified to the final; the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe winner from each heat qualified for the final."

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Sydney Barnes",
        "text": "Sydney Barnes was a professional cricketer who played for England in 27 Test matches between 1901 and 1914. He claimed 24 five-wicket hauls (five or more wickets in an innings) during his Test career. A five-wicket haul is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of 2014 fewer than 50 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Barnes had only played seven first-class matches when he was chosen by Archie MacLaren to tour Australia, and played only 47 County Championship matches throughout his entire career, opting to play Minor Counties and Lancashire League cricket instead. He based his decision upon two main criteria – playing club cricket was more financially rewarding, and he was worried about having to bowl too much in first-class county cricket, and suffering from burnout.\nBarnes is generally regarded as one of the best bowlers to have played international cricket, and finished his Test career with 189 wickets at an average of 16.43; his average places him among the top-ten bowlers in Test cricket. At the start of his career, he was a fast bowler who endeavoured to swing the ball, which was the common style of bowling at the time. However, Barnes experimented with bowling a little slower and cutting the ball, and developed both an off cutter and a leg cutter that he concluded were far more effective than swinging the ball. Despite his bowling talent, Barnes did not play any Test cricket between July 1902 and December 1907, as he was considered a \"prima donna\" who would only put in the effort when he was in the right mood, and being suitably paid. After his recall to the England side, he played regularly until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and was named by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1910.\nBarnes made his Test debut in December 1901 against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and it was in this match that he took his first international five-wicket haul. He claimed five wickets and conceded 65 runs, (noted as five for 65), in the first innings of the match. On his second Test appearance, during the same tour, Barnes collected six wickets in the first innings and seven wickets in the second innings, to complete the first of seven occasions in which he took ten or more wickets in a match. Barnes' best bowling performances were against the South African cricket team in their 1913–14 series in South Africa. In their summary of the tour, \"Wisden\" noted that; \"his success exceeded all expectation. He was simply irresistible.\" Barnes took five-wicket hauls in four of the five Test matches on the tour, and claimed ten or more wickets in three of them. During the second Test, he recorded the best figures of his career, collecting eight for 56 in the first innings and nine for 103 in the second. His match figures of 17 for 159 were the best in Test cricket at the time, and though since surpassed by Jim Laker's 19 wickets in 1956, remain second among all bowlers in Tests. That series marked Barnes' final appearances in Test cricket.\nNotes and references.\nNotes\nReferences"

        "title": "1925 Colored World Series",
        "text": "The 1925 Colored World Series was the second edition of the championship series in Negro league baseball. The series featured a rematch between the Hilldale Club of Darby, Pennsylvania, champion of the Eastern Colored League (ECL), and the Kansas City Monarchs, champion of the Negro National League (NNL) and winner of the previous year's match in the first Colored World Series. In 1925, Hilldale won the best-of-nine series, five games to one.\nOn the eve of the series, the Monarchs' star pitcher, Bullet Rogan, who had pitched a shutout in the deciding Game 7 of the NNL championship series, was injured while playing with his child at home, when a needle ran into his leg, leaving him unable to play in the World Series. Kansas City's manager and occasional pitcher was future Hall of Famer, 38-year-old José Méndez. Hilldale featured three future Hall of Famers—catcher, Biz Mackey, third baseman, Judy Johnson, and 35-year-old backup catcher and pinch hitter, Louis Santop.\nAttendance for series was disappointing—down more than 50 percent in comparison with the previous year's series. The financial results were so disappointing that one Kansas City Monarchs player said they would have been paid better barnstorming than playing in the series.\nFor both teams, the 1925 season would represent the end to a three-year run as league champions. (Both teams had won their league championships in 1923, when no world series was played.) Kansas City would eventually return to win additional championships, appearing in the 1942 and 1946 series and winning in 1942. For Hilldale, however, the 1925 championship would be its last, as the team folded in 1932.\nRoute to the series.\nKansas City Monarchs.\nIn 1925, the NNL, which played in the Midwestern and Southern United States, held a split season championship, with 50 games scheduled for each half. The teams qualifying to play in the league were the Kansas City Monarchs, the St. Louis Stars, the Memphis Red Sox, the Chicago American Giants, the Birmingham Black Barons, the Detroit Stars, the Indianapolis ABCs, and the Cuban Stars (West). The first half opened on April 27 and closed on July 8, and the second half ran from July 11 through September 16.\nThe American Giants got off to an early lead in the NNL first half race, winning six of their first eight games. The next week, Detroit pulled ahead, but by May 26 the Monarchs reached first place when they took three games of four from the visiting Detroit Stars. The following week, the Monarchs took five straight from the American Giants, opening a lead on the other teams. In mid-June, the St. Louis Stars narrowed the lead but weren't able to catch the Monarchs, and on June 29 the Monarchs clinched the first-half title with a 2–1 victory over the Cuban Stars.\nThe St. Louis Stars started the second half going 7–1, jumping to an early lead. Soon the Chicago American Giants gained a slight lead, and during the first half of August the race between St. Louis and Chicago was neck and neck. When the American Giants dropped three games of four to the Monarchs from August 15–18 and then lost three straight to St. Louis on August 22–24, they dropped to third place and fell out of the race. Kansas City were now in second place, and when they swept four games against St. Louis on September 5–8, they moved to within just .005 the Stars. St. Louis held onto their lead, and finished the second half with a .760 winning percentage, .022 ahead of second place Kansas City.\nThe NNL scheduled a best-five-of-nine championship series, with the first three games in St. Louis on September 19–21 and the next three games (home games for the Monarchs) played in Chicago because the American Association's Kansas City Blues were finishing their season at home, tying up Muehlebach Field. Kansas City won the first game 8–6, as Bullet Rogan pitched a complete game and Newt Allen, Dobie Moore, and Frank Duncan hit home runs. St. Louis won the second game 6–3, behind the pitching of Roosevelt Davis and excellent plays in the field by Willie Wells, Cool Papa Bell, and Branch Russell.\nRain prevented the third game from being played on September 21 or 22. The league directors met and decided that the league championship series should be shortened to a best-of-seven series instead of best-of-nine. On September 23, St. Louis won the third game 3–2, behind a home run by Dewey Creacy, an RBI double by Bell, and another run scored by Bell on a wild throw by Moore. Kansas City evened the series in game four, played in Chicago on September 26, beating St. Louis 5–4 with Bullet Rogan not only pitching, but also getting four hits, including a game-winning single in the bottom of the ninth. The next day, St. Louis won 2–1, scoring both runs in the top of the ninth. On September 28, the final two games were scheduled as a doubleheader, with Kansas City needing to win both games to avoid elimination. The Monarchs won the first game 9–3 behind a strong pitching performance by William Bell. Rogan took the mound for the second game with only one day of rest and pitched a 4–0 shutout over the Stars, winning the league championship and the chance to face Hilldale in the World Series.\nHilldale.\nThe ECL agreed to a 70-game schedule, with the league consisting of eight teams: the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, New Jersey, the Baltimore Black Sox, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, the Cuban Stars (East), the Harrisburg Giants, the Hilldale Club, the Lincoln Giants of New York City, and the Potomacs, formerly of Washington, DC, who announced that they were moving to Wilmington, Delaware for the 1925 season. The season opened on April 25 and finished on September 19.\nHilldale started the season with a 9–2 record, jumping to an early lead. By June 13, Harrisburg had taken a narrow lead and was scheduled to face Hilldale in a two-game series. Hilldale won the first game 11–9, retaking the lead, and the next day second game was called due to rain after Harrisburg had taken a 6–2 lead, prompting an outraged letter to the editor from Oscar Charleston, Harrisburg's manager and star center fielder. Charleston complained about the quality of the umpiring in the first game and the decision to call the second game. Charleston's outburst prompted a strong rebuttal from Ed Bolden, owner of the Hilldale Club and chairman of the ECL commission. Shortly after the game, Harrisburg retook the lead and held it for nearly a month. On July 19, Hilldale regained the lead when Baltimore swept a doubleheader from Harrisburg.\nIn mid-July, George Robinson, owner of the Wilmington Potomacs, announced that his team was folding; the league contracted to seven teams and the Potomacs players dispersed to other teams. Over the next few weeks Hilldale widened its lead, and by early September they appeared to have the championship in hand. With the Potomacs no longer playing and with many teams having missed games, teams in the league were unable to complete their 70-game schedules. Hilldale easily won the ECL championship, finishing the season with a 45–13 record, while second-place Harrisburg finished 37–18.\nSeries plans.\nThe ECL commissioners and Rube Foster, president of the NNL, announced that the World Series would be a best-five-of-nine series. The first four games would be played in the home field of the NNL champion on October 1, 2, 3, and 4, with October 5 and 6 available for make-up games in case of rain. Then the series would move to Philadelphia, the home for Hilldale, on October 8, 9, and 10. On Sunday, October 11, play would move to Jersey City, New Jersey because of blue laws in Philadelphia (though the leagues originally planned to play the game in New York City), and game nine (if necessary) would be played back in Philadelphia on October 12. Because the parks had to be secured in advance, the teams agreed to play exhibition games on October 10 and 11 if the series ended early. The games in Kansas City would take place at Muehlebach Field, the American Association ballpark, and the games in Philadelphia would take place at the Baker Bowl, the National League park, and the game in Jersey City would take place at the International League park.\nRosters.\nHilldale's regular lineup included Biz Mackey as the catcher, Tank Carr at first base, Frank Warfield, the manager, at second, Judy Johnson at third, Jake Stephens at shortstop, Clint Thomas in left field, George Johnson in center field, and Otto Briggs in right field. Briggs was the leadoff hitter, while Warfield batted second in four of the six games, Carr batted third, Mackey was cleanup hitter, Judy Johnson hit fifth, Thomas sixth, and George Johnson seventh. Their starting pitchers were Rube Currie, Phil Cockrell, Scrip Lee, and Nip Winters, with Red Ryan pitching in relief. From the bench, Louis Santop, Namon Washington, and Newt Robinson played as pinch hitters or defensive replacements.\nKansas City's roster took a major hit the day before the first game, when Bullet Rogan, their star pitcher, ran a needle into his leg while playing with his child on the floor. While attempting to remove it himself, he broke it, and had to have it removed surgically, leaving him unable to play in the series. Utility player Dink Mothell was confined to bed and also unable to play.\nDuring the World Series, Kansas City's regular lineup consisted of Frank Duncan at catcher, Lemuel Hawkins at first base, Newt Allen at second, Newt Joseph at third, Dobie Moore at shortstop, Wade Johnston in left field, Hurley McNair in center, and George Sweatt in right. Their most common batting order had Johnston leading off, Allen batting second, McNair third, Moore in the cleanup spot, Joseph fifth, Hawkins sixth, Sweatt seventh, and Duncan eighth. The starting pitchers were Cliff Bell, William Bell, Nelson Dean, and Bill Drake, with manager José Méndez pitching in relief. The only Monarchs bench player to appear in the series was pinch hitter Hooks Foreman.\nSeries.\nGame 1.\nHilldale won the series opener in Kansas City, 5–2, in 12 innings. The winning pitcher was Rube Currie, who struck out six and gave up nine hits, two runs, and one walk in a 12-inning complete game. Bill Drake, who pitched the last two innings for Kansas City in relief for starter Cliff Bell, was charged with the loss. Otto Briggs drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the top of the 12th.\nThe game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth inning, when McNair led off with a single to left, then scored on Moore's double to right. In the top of the seventh, Hilldale evened the score. Thomas drew a walk to lead off the inning, and with the infield drawn in looking for a bunt, George Johnson drilled a single into center, advancing Thomas to third. The next batter, Warfield, hit the first pitch for a long fly to right field, and Thomas scored after the catch.\nThe game remained tied 1–1 through the ninth inning, so it went to extra innings. In the top of the 11th, Briggs led off with a line drive single up the middle, which Cliff Bell attempted to catch, hurting his hand. After Bell walked Stephens, Kansas City brought in Drake as a relief pitcher. The next batter, Carr, singled to left-center and Briggs attempted to score from second, but was out on George Johnson's throw to the plate. According to \"The Chicago Defender\", \"in tagging Briggs, he [Duncan] pulled him two feet off and away from the plate for an out. The crowd rose en masse to cheer. It was indeed a great play as well as a great peg by Johnston.\" However, the next batter, Mackey, singled to center and scored Stephens from second, giving Hilldale the lead. In the bottom of the inning, McNair reached with one out on an infield single. He then stole second, and Moore tripled to right, scoring McNair. But when the next batter, Joseph, hit a ground ball to third, Judy Johnson was able to bluff Moore back to third before throwing Joseph out. Hawkins then grounded out to short, ending the inning with a 2–2 tie.\nIn the top of the 12th, Drake hit the first batter he faced, George Johnson. Warfield singled to right, advancing Johnson to third. After Currie struck out, Briggs singled to left, scoring Johnson, and advanced to second on the throw to the plate. After Stephens struck out, Carr singled and drove in McNair and Warfield. Mackey then struck out to retire the side, but Hilldale was ahead 5–2. In the bottom of the inning, Sweatt grounded out to the pitcher, Duncan flew out to left, and Foreman, pinch hitting for Drake, grounded out to second, ending the game.\nGame 2.\nIn the second game, the Monarchs evened the series with a 5–3 victory. Nelson Dean was the winning pitcher as he struck out two and gave up eight hits, three runs, and four walks in innings. William Bell got the save. The losing pitcher, Phil Cockrell, was hurt by a couple of costly errors, as he struck out four and gave up 10 hits and four walks in a complete game. In the bottom of the eighth, Kansas City broke open a 2–2 tie when an error by Jake Stephens was followed by RBI singles by Lemuel Hawkins and Frank Duncan. In the top of the ninth, Hilldale answered with one run, but was unable to catch the Monarchs.\nKansas City got the first run on the board in the first inning, when McNair knocked a one-out double over Thomas's head in left field and Allen drove him in with a single to right. In the top of second, Hilldale responded with two runs. Mackey led off with a walk and Judy Johnson bunted him to second. Thomas then singled to left center, driving home Mackey. George Johnson hit a single to center, and Thomas advanced to third and Johnson to second when McNair fumbled the ball. Hilldale then put on a squeeze play to score Thomas, with Warfield out at first.\nHilldale held onto their 2–1 lead until the seventh inning. In the top of the fourth, they threatened when Judy Johnson led off with a single and stole second. With two outs, Warfield hit a line drive headed for right field, but Hawkins made a leaping catch. In the bottom of the seventh, Sweatt led off for Kansas City with a single to center. Duncan sacrificed, then Dean doubled to right to score Sweatt, tying the game at two runs apiece.\nIn the bottom of the eighth inning, Allen led off with an infield hit. Moore struck out, but Joseph reached when Hilldale shortstop Stephens fumbled a ground ball. Hawkins then singled to center, scoring Allen. Next, Sweatt walked, loading the bases, and Duncan hit a bounder to third that Judy Johnson had to leap to catch, allowing Joseph to score an unearned run and Duncan to reach first. Dean then hit a fly ball that Stephens caught on the edge of the grass, but he let Hawkins score from third. \"The Chicago Defender\" wrote, \"The crowd was puzzled, because it looked like Stephens had plenty of time to set himself to throw. It looked to the scorers as if he hadn't figured wheretu Hawkins would take a chance to score after the catch. When he did wake up he threw wide to Mackey.\" The Monarchs now led 5–2. In the top of the ninth, Warfield led off with a walk. Cockrell grounded into a force play by Moore at second, then Briggs singled to center. Santop, pinch hitting, made the second out on a fly to right center, then Carr singled to right to score Cockrell. An intentional walk was issued to Mackey, and Judy Johnson ended the game with a fly out to center.\nGame 3.\nHilldale won the third game, 3–1, in ten innings, taking a series lead of two games to one. Red Ryan, who pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Hilldale starter Scrip Lee, was credited with the win, and Monarchs manager and pitcher José Méndez, who gave up all three runs in a three-inning relief outing for starter William Bell, was charged with the loss. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the eighth, when Kansas City scored a run, which was matched by Hilldale in the top of the ninth. Hilldale's decisive runs in the top of the tenth—an RBI double by Namon Washington, followed by an RBI single by Newt Robinson—were provided by late inning substitutes.\nAlthough no runs were scored in the first seven innings, Hilldale mounted several threats. In the second inning, they left runners at second and third after a walk by Thomas and a double by Stephens. In the third, Briggs led off with an infield single and was sacrificed to second, but was then picked off by Bell. In the fourth, Mackey led off with a single, and Judy Johnson followed with a double. Thomas then grounded to short, and Moore threw out Mackey at the plate. After Thomas stole second, George Johnson lined out to first. Stephens walked to load the bases, but Lee struck out to end the threat. In the top of the eighth, Carr led off with a walk, Mackey got an infield hit, and Judy Johnson singled to short left to load the bases with no outs. Méndez came in to relieve William Bell. Thomas grounded to short, and Moore threw out Carr at home. Santop pinch hit for George Johnson; according to \"The Chicago Defender\": \"'Big Bertha' hit one to Moore that was hotter than tabasco sauce. Moore knocked it down with his gloved hand as it bounded fast over the ground, stumbled over second, forcing Thomas out and throwing to Hawkins from a half crouching position, getting Santop headed for first and making one of the prettiest of double plays.\"\nMeanwhile, Lee held the Monarchs hitless through the first four innings, and to one hit through seven. With two outs in the bottom of the eighth, the Monarchs offense finally came alive, when Johnston singled to right, and McNair reached on an error by Carr. Allen then singled to right, driving in Johnston to take a 1–0 lead. Hilldale responded in the top of the ninth, when Cockrell, pinch hitting for Lee, reached base with a one-out walk. Briggs followed with a single to left, and Warfield grounded to shortstop, forcing Briggs at second. With two outs, Carr singled to right, scoring Cockrell and tying the game.\nIn the bottom of the ninth, Hilldale reliever Ryan retired the side in order. In the top of the tenth, Judy Johnson led off with a single to center. Thomas sacrificed him to second, then Washington doubled to center to drive in the go-ahead run. Robinson singled to right, scoring Washington, and took second on the throw to the plate, but was thrown out trying to take third as well. In the bottom of the tenth, Duncan hit a one-out double to left, but Foreman and Johnston both flied out to end the game, with a 3–1 victory for Hilldale.\nGame 4.\nHilldale won the fourth game, 7–3, in front of the largest crowd of the series. The winning pitcher was Nip Winters, who pitched a complete game, allowing eight hits and three runs, striking out eight, and walking three. The loser, Bill Drake, also pitched a complete game and yielded 11 hits and seven runs, struck out three, and walked three. A high wind caused both teams trouble with judging fly balls. Hilldale took a 2–1 lead in the fourth when Biz Mackey tripled and Judy Johnson drove him in with a sacrifice fly. They added a run in the fifth, and Kansas City answered in the seventh, narrowing the margin to 3–2. In the top of the ninth, Hilldale broke the game open with four runs in the top of the ninth, and the Monarchs only managed one run in the bottom of the ninth as they fell behind in the series, three games to one.\nIn the top of the first, Warfield singled with one out on a hit that Allen was just able to knock down. Carr then singled to center, with the wind causing an unusual hop that enabled Warfield to race home with the first run. In the bottom of the second, Kansas City answered, with Joseph hitting a one-out triple to right. Hawkins then grounded to Warfield, who threw home. Joseph slid into home spikes first, and Mackey dropped the ball, allowing the run to score and tying the game.\nIn the top of the fourth, Mackey hit a one-out triple to right field. Judy Johnson followed with a long fly out to right, scoring Mackey and giving Hilldale a 2–1 lead. In the next inning, Hilldale added on. With two outs, Stephens grounded to short and beat out Moore's throw. He then stole second and advanced to third on a passed ball. Briggs singled to right, scoring Stephens. In the bottom of the seventh, Sweatt led off with a hit to right. After Duncan struck out, Drake hit a fly ball to center, which the wind caused George Johnson to misjudge; when it rolled away, Drake reached third with a triple, driving in Sweatt, and narrowing Hilldale's lead to 3–2.\nIn the top of the ninth, George Johnson led off with a triple to center. Winters drove him in with a single to center. Stephens grounded to third, forcing Winters at second. Briggs followed with a double to right, advancing Stephens to third, and Warfield tripled to right-center, driving in two more runs, and scored himself when Joseph missed McNair's throw to third. Kansas City entered the bottom of the ninth trailing 7–2, and Joseph led off with a single to right. Hawkins beat out an infield hit to Judy Johnson at third. Sweatt singled to right, scoring Joseph and advancing Hawkins to third. The next three Kansas City batters, however, made easy outs, ending the game 7–3.\nGame 5.\nThe series resumed in Philadelphia, where Hilldale won their first home game, 2–1, taking a series lead of four games to one. The winning pitcher was Rube Currie, who gave up six hits and one run, striking out four and walking one in a complete game. The losing pitcher, Cliff Bell, lasted innings and gave up eight hits and two runs, striking out one. Both of Hilldale's runs came in the fourth inning, when Tank Carr hit a one-out solo home run, which was followed by a pair of doubles by Biz Mackey and Clint Thomas.\nMoore led off the top of the second inning with a hit off Currie's glove, but he was caught off first by catcher Mackey and thrown out trying to advance to second. In the top of the fourth, McNair led off with a single to right, and a one-out single by Joseph advanced him to second. Again, the Monarchs lost their opportunity to a baserunning blunder, when McNair was caught trying to steal third with two outs.\nIn the bottom of the fourth, Hilldale took the lead with Carr's one-out solo home run over the high right field wall. Mackey followed with a double hit against the same wall. With two outs, Thomas hit a ground ball past Moore for a double, scoring Mackey, and giving Hilldale a 2–0 lead. In the bottom of the fifth, they threatened again with Stephens and Currie hitting a pair of singles to lead off the inning. Briggs then hit into a double play, and with Dean brought in to relieve Cliff Bell, Hilldale tried a squeeze play, but Warfield was thrown out on the bunt.\nIn the top of the sixth, Allen hit a one-out double to the fence in center field. With two outs, Moore doubled to right, driving in Allen and narrowing Hilldale's lead to one run. In the bottom of the sixth, Hilldale had runners on first and third with one out, and Thomas hit a fly caught by Allen in short right near the foul line. Carr tried to score from third, and was gunned down on the relay from Allen to Hawkins to Duncan. Kansas City's only hit in the last three innings was a one-out double by Duncan in the top of the seventh, so they were unable to catch Hilldale.\nGame 6.\nOn October 9, heavy rain forced the sixth game to be delayed a day. On Saturday, October 10, play resumed despite freezing temperatures and gusting winds that kept all but the hardiest of fans away. Phil Cockrell, a spitball pitcher, was the winner, as he allowed eight hits and two runs, striking out six, and walking four, in a complete game. William Bell, the loser, also went the distance, as he allowed nine hits and five runs, struck out four, and walked one. Hilldale scored runs in the fourth and fifth innings and two in the sixth, then Biz Mackey hit a solo home run to lead off the seventh. The Monarchs answered with one run each in the seventh and ninth innings, but fell to Hilldale, 5–2, ending the series with Hilldale victorious five games to one.\nThe Hilldale Club was first to score in the bottom of the fourth, when Thomas hit a two-out double to center. George Johnson drove him in with a single to left. In the fifth, Warfield reached base with one out on an error by Moore. Carr walked, and Mackey doubled off the right field wall, driving in Warfield. Judy Johnson grounded to Bell, and Carr was thrown out trying to get back to third after attempting to score on the play. Thomas flied out to end the inning, and Hilldale was up, 2–0.\nIn the sixth, Cockrell reached with one out on an error by Joseph. Stephens doubled, driving in Cockrell. Briggs grounded out to Allen, advancing Stephens to third, and then Stephens scored when Warfield beat out a hit to Joseph at third, widening Hilldale's lead to 4–0. In the top of the seventh, Allen led off with a single to right. McNair sacrificed, and after Moore flied out, Allen stole third. Joseph was hit by a pitch, and Hawkins beat out a slow roller to Judy Johnson at third, scoring Allen, and making the score, 4–1.\nIn the bottom of the seventh, Mackey led off with a home run over the right field fence, making it 5–1. The Monarchs' final opportunity came in the top of the ninth, when McNair led off the inning with a double off the scoreboard. Moore followed with a double off the right field wall, scoring McNair. Joseph reached base safely on an error by Judy Johnson. But when Hawkins hit a short fly to left, Thomas raced in to catch it. Stephens fumbled a ground ball hit by Duncan, loading the bases with one out. Foreman pinch hit for Sweatt, but struck out, and George Johnson sprinted in to catch William Bell's fly for the last out, ending the game, 5–2, and the series, five games to one.\nExhibition Game.\nBecause the ballpark in Jersey City had already been retained, the two teams played an exhibition on game in Jersey City on Sunday, October 11. The Monarchs' young pitcher, Chet Brewer, held the champions to one run, as Kansas City beat Hilldale, 6–1. The Hilldale players made seven errors, and the Hilldale starter, Nip Winters, gave up five walks. Although the game did not count in the series, it was counted in the financial results of the series.\nFinancial results.\nTotal attendance for the series (including the exhibition game) was 20,067, less than half the 45,857 who had attended the ten games of the 1924 series. Total receipts were $21,045, in comparison with $52,113 the previous year. Total expenses were $15,173, including $3,748 for park rent, $5,543 for railroad fares and hotels for the two ball clubs, $2,050 for war tax, and $827 for umpires. A surplus of $5,872 was available for distribution, with $1,233 going to the owners of the victorious Hilldale club, the same amount split among their players, and $822 each going to the owner and the players of the Kansas City Monarchs. Newspaper reports described the financial results as disappointing and attributed the poor attendance to cold weather and a shortened and lopsided series. Frank A. Young, sports editor of \"The Chicago Defender,\" noted that each player on the victorious Hilldale club received only about $80, or $6.66 a day, for his efforts, and quoted a Kansas City player who said, \"We could have made more in two games barnstorming than we'll get out of the whole series.\""

        "text": "In the 1943 Negro World Series, the Washington Homestead Grays, champions of the Negro National League beat the Birmingham Black Barons, champions of the Negro American League, four games to three, with one tie. The games were played in seven different cities.\nBackground.\nThe Negro American League held a Championship Series for the first time, matching the champion of the first half of the season with the second half champion. Neither league would have a postseason series to determine the participant in the World Series until 1948, the last held Negro World Series (both the American and National Leagues would hold a series, which coincidentally saw Birmingham and Homestead win the pennant). Box scores are scarce for the series.\nBirmingham Black Barons vs. Chicago American Giants:\n\"Barons win series 3-2\"\nThe Grays continued their success in 1943, having won the NNL pennant six of the past seven years. Candy Jim Taylor, a long-time manager for several Negro league teams, served as manager as Vic Harris had decided to take a secondary job that kept him part-time in the outfield. The Grays went 53-14-1, far better than any of their NNL competition.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe pitching match-up would see Alfred Saylor pitch a five hitter for the Barons, while the Grays' Johnny Wright and Ray Brown would give up eleven combined hits. The Barons struck first in the top of the 1st inning when Felix McLaurin hit a double past Grays' 1st baseman Buck Leonard. Tommy Sampson hit a single to right field, scoring McLaurin, and then was thrown out trying to steal second. Clyde \"Little Splo\" Spearman hit a double, advanced on a Piper Davis single, and then scored after Grays' catcher Josh Gibson bobbled a low pitch after he slipped in the mud. In the bottom of the 1st, Cool Papa Bell hit a triple for the Grays and then scored on a Buck Leonard sacrifice fly. The score stood 2-1 with the Barons in the lead heading into the 2nd. In the 4th, Barons' outfielder Lester Lockett doubled and scored on a Leonard \"Sloppy\" Lindsay single, bringing the score to 3-1. The next score would come in the top of the 7th, when both Hoss \"Horse\" Walker and Ted \"Double Duty\" Radcliffe singled to reach base. Grays' shortstop, Sam Bankhead boggled a grounder by McLaurin which would allow Walker to score. The game stood at 4-1 going into the 9th inning. The Grays had a late 9th inning surge. With one out, Saylor ended up walking both Leonard and Gibson. Howard Easterling stepped up and hit a single, which would score Leonard. However Easterling tried to turn his single into a double and was tagged out on his way to second. Sam Bankhead hit a fly ball that clinched the victory for Birmingham. \nGame 2.\nFive combined pitchers were used for a game that went twelve innings before being called due to midnight curfew, matching Gentry Jessup for Birmingham against Spoon Carter of Homestead. Gentry Jessup had a 5-4 lead in the ninth for the Barons, but he allowed a single to Howard Easterling to leadoff the inning. A double by Sam Bankhead tied the game at 5. Jessup was replaced after getting a double play for Alvin Gipson. Jessup allowed ten hits with five runs scored on three strikeouts and four walks. Alvin Gipson went innings and allowed two hits with one walk and two strikeouts.\nThe only serious threat in the extra innings was in the tenth, when the Grays got runners on second and first on a hit by Cool Papa Bell and an bunt-error by Jerry Benjamin. But Buck Leonard, Josh Gibson, and Easterling all committed outs to strand the runners. As for the Grays, starter Spoon Carter had lasted just six innings while allowing four runs to score on seven hits while striking out five. He was replaced for Edsall Walker, who pitched five innings and allowed one run on four hits while walking six and striking out three. Johnny Wright was sent to pitch the twelfth inning, and he allowed just one hit with no runs.\nGame 3.\nFor the first time since the 1925 Colored World Series, there would be a Series with at two games that went to extra innings. Game 3 matched Johnny Markham for Birmingham against Roy Partlow for Homestead.\nHomestead struck first in the second inning, starting with a walk to Sam Bankhead. This was followed by a single by Vic Harris. With Robert Gaston at bat, he hit a single to center field. When fielder Felix McLaurin went to field it, he would commit an error that helped to score both Bankhead and Harris after the ball went over third base. Catcher Ted Radcliffe got the ball and threw to home plate, but with no one at the plate, Gaston raced home with no trouble.\nThe game remained quiet until the sixth inning. Birmingham started it off with a leadoff single by Felix McLaurin that went off the fingertip of Partlow's hand. McLaurin would get to third on a groundout and a Clyde Spearman single. Lester Lockett then hit a single to right field that made the score 3-1 and resulted in Partlow being pulled from the game. He had pitched innings and allowed five hits while striking a batter out and walking one. Ray Brown would step in and get the final two outs, but an error on a ball hit by Leonard Lindsay by shortstop Sam Bankhead scored Spearman and Lockett.\nThe game stayed silent until the eleventh inning. Bankhead started the inning with a leadoff single. Vic Harris made a sacrifice bunt that resulted in Bankhead getting to third when Lindsay made an error at first base. Josh Gibson was brought in to pinch hit for Gaston, and he was intentionally walked to load the bases. Brown, batting in the nine-hole spot, hit a ball to first that resulted in a force-out at the plate for one out. Cool Papa Bell would go to bat and then hit a ball to right field for a walk-off single to win it for Homestead.\nBrown ultimately allowed no hits for innings while getting a walk and four strikeouts. Markham threw innings and allowed four runs on nine hits with a strikeout and five walks.\nGame 4.\nJohnny Wright was sent out by the Grays to start against Gready McKinnis for Birmingham, and Wright would outduel both McKinnis and John Huber, sent out to put the fire of what proved to be a blowout. A walk to Josh Gibson led to the first run in the second inning, as Howard Easterling hit a double to left to score him from first. With two outs in the third, Jerry Benjamin hit a single and got to second base on an error by Tommy Sampson. Buck Leonard then hit a triple to score Benjamin and make it 2-0. In the fifth, Cool Papa Bell hit a single to start the inning and then got to third base on a Benjamin bunt to the pitcher that went for an error and another bunt by Leonard. A flyout by Gibson scored Bell and made it 3-0.\nThe Grays set the fire for six runs in the sixth, beginning with a groundball by Jud Wilson that got him to first when the first baseman made an error. Vic Harris then drew a walk before Wright bunted his way to first base. With the bases loaded, Bell hit a double to left that scored two runs. An intentional walk was later issued to Buck Leonard before Gibson returned the favor with a single to right to score two runs. A single by Howard Easterling score another run, while a groundout by Matt Carlisle scored Gibson (who had stolen third base) to close the scoring.\nWright allowed just five hits while walking six and striking out three. McKinnis allowed three runs on five hits in five innings with three walks and two strikeouts before Huber was sent to pitch the remaining four innings. He allowed six runs on five hits, two walks, and one strikeout.\nGame 6.\nJohnny Wright was matched against Gready McKinnis in a rematch of Game 4, and it once again proved a wash. Wright threw his second complete game while allowing no runs on eight hits with three walks and four strikeouts, while McKinnis lasted innings and allowed eight runs on seven hits with five walks and six strikeouts before being taken out for Johnny Markham, who allowed one hit with two walks in innings.\nGame 7.\nThis was the first and only Negro World Series that had three games go to extra innings (by the time the Series ended, the two teams had played for a combined 79 innings, the longest for any best-of-seven series). Homestead sent Roy Partlow against Birmingham's Johnny Markham.\nThere were a handful of hits and baserunners on for both teams, but bad timing proved key to a shutout for ten innings. It was only in the eighth inning that either team had two runners on base; in the eighth, Jud Wilson had a leadoff single and Partlow was walked with two out, but Cool Papa Bell failed to score the runners on his groundball that resulted in a quelled threat. They had the next chance in the ninth when Jerry Benjamin and Howard Easterling hit singles. However, Wilson would hit an out to end the inning. Birmingham responded with two singles in the tenth, but they also could not score them home. In total, 19 baserunners were left combined by both teams.\nThe game was decided in the eleventh inning. With two outs, Leonard Lindsay hit a triple to left field. Ed Steele, batting in the eight-hole spot, hit a single to right to give the Barons a walk-off victory and even the Series up at three. Partlow had pitched innings and allowed ten hits with two walks and six strikeouts, while Markham had allowed eight hits in eleven innings with a walk and two strikeouts.\nGame 8.\nThe decisive Game 8 proved to be a tight affair decided by a late inning comeback that relied on the bullpens. It matched Johnny Wright of Homestead versus Alfred Saylor of Birmingham. The Grays held the lead first in a hurry. Cool Papa Bell hit a leadoff single and then got to second on a sacrifice bunt before Buck Leonard got him home on a single.\nBirmingham struck back in the third inning. Leonard Lindsay drew a leadoff walk, and Felix McLaurin drew a walk after an out, while Tommy Sampson hit a single to load the bases for Clyde Spearman. He would hit a single that tied the game at one. Lester Lockett would it a flyball to right field that resulted in a sacrifice fly that gave the Barons a 2-1 lead. They added to their lead in the fifth, with McLaurin reaching on a walk before stealing second base. A single by Spearman would cause him to score when catcher Josh Gibson committed an error. \nThe Grays responded one inning later, starting with a double by Leonard and a single by Gibson. With one out, a groundball hit by Jud Wilson would get Gibson out but score Leonard from third base. Birmingham struck in the bottom half after getting singles by Ed Steele, Piper Davis, and Saylor, with the latter hit driving in Steele. Wright had gone six innings and allowed six hits with four runs on nine strikeouts before being taken out (replaced by Ray Brown, hitting for him in the seventh inning). Brown was sent to pitch while the team was trailing 4-2, and he would hold the fort for the closing three innings, allowing no runs on two hits.\nBirmingham, six outs from victory, would implode in the eighth inning. It started with a walk to Benjamin, who was then forced out when Buck Leonard hit a grounder to right fielder Spearman. Josh Gibson hit a single to center that would result in Leonard getting to third and Gibson to second base when fielder McLaurin misplayed the ball. With Howard Easterling up, he hit a single that would score both runners and even the game at 4. One out later, Vic Harris was up to bat. He hit a single that got Easterling to third, and he proceeded to steal second base. That set the stage for Sam Bankhead, who hit a single to right field that scored both runners and broke the tie.\nSaylor had pitched eight innings for the Barons while allowing ten hits and six runs with four walks before being taken out (replaced when it came time for him to bat in the eighth). Gready McKinnis was sent to pitch the ninth inning of a two-run deficit, but it would not end well. He allowed Benjamin to reach on an error committed by himself. A sacrifice bunt was then followed by a double by Josh Gibson to score the runner, and an error by Spearman on Easterling's groundball scored Gibson and made it 8-4. Birmingham went down in four batters, with Lockett committing the final out as Homestead clinched the championship."

        "title": "1944 Negro World Series",
        "text": "In the 1944 Negro World Series, the Washington Homestead Grays, champions of the Negro National League were matched against the Birmingham Black Barons, champions of the Negro American League, for the second year in a row. The Grays won the series again, four games to one.\nBackground.\nBirmingham went 48-22 while Homestead went 27–12.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn the opening game, the Grays would get three home runs from three different players - no team had hit more than one in a game since Game 3 of the 1942 Negro World Series, which was also the last time a Gray had hit a home run. They would use this along with timely hitting to beat the Barons at home. Homestead started the scoring in the first inning with a one-out double by Jerry Benjamin. He got to third base after Sam Bankhead and Buck Leonard were walked, and Dave Hoskins would hit into a fielder's choice that scored Hoskins and made it 1–0. Birmingham matched the score at one in the third inning. Felix McLaurin drew a one-out walk and stole second base and went to third after Artie Wilson hit a single. Ed Steele would then his a single to right field to score the run home. However, when Piper Davis hit into a fielders choice to the third baseman, Wilson would be called out at home plate, and Ted Radcliffe would also hit a ball right to the second baseman in Jelly Jackson to get the third out.\nThe tie was broken on the first batter of the fourth inning as Josh Gibson hit a home run to right field to make it 2–1, and Buck Leonard hit a home run to the same porch in the next inning. With the game 3–1, the Barons made one last attempt. John Britton lined a single to start the inning and was followed soon by Artie Wilson. With two out, Steele would hit a ball that was off home plate that was thought to be foul at first. However, the umpires ruled that it was a fair ball, thereby making Steele out; the Barons played the rest of the game under protest, to no avail. When the Grays came to bat in the eighth, Dave Hoskins hit a leadoff home run to the same porch as the two home run hitters before him to make it 4–1. Gibson followed with a single, and Walter Cannady had a double to get him to third. Two outs later, Cool Papa Bell lined a triple to center field that would score Gibson and Cannady to make it 6–1. Both teams scored in the ninth inning to close the game. Bankhead had a single and advanced on a wild pitch and an out to third base, and he scored on a subsequent single by Hoskins. A sacrifice hit by Walter Cannady scored Hoskins to close out the Grays end of the bat. Johnny Markham hit a leadoff single to start the bottom frame, and pinch-runner Collins Jones went to second on a wild pitch before scoring on a one-out Artie Wilson single. Piper Davis would hit a two-out single to score in Wilson before Ted Radcliffe committed the final out to end the game.\nStarter Roy Welmaker threw nine innings for the Grays and allowed three runs on eleven hits while striking out seven with one walk. For the Black Barons, Johnny Markham allowed eight runs on eleven hits while walking four and striking out six.\nGame 2.\nThe Grays started slowly but ran through a late rally to take a 2–0 lead in the Series. Cool Papa Bell started the game with a leadoff single to center field, but Jerry Benjamin's fielder choice hit meant that Benjamin was on first with one out. A single by Sam Bankhead and a walk to Buck Leonard loaded the bases for Dave Hoskins. He would hit a flyball to center field that Benjamin scored on. However, Bankhead was soon thrown out while trying to steal third base and the game was 1-0 after one inning. The Black Barons evened the score in the fourth. An error by Bankhead at shortstop meant that Piper Davis had gotten to first base with one out, and he made it to second on a passed ball by Josh Gibson. Two batters later, Lester Lockett hit a two-out double to left field that scored Davis.\nIn the seventh, the Grays got the go-ahead run. Leonard hit a leadoff single and then got to second on a ground out and then stole third base. Josh Gibson was walked on purpose and then stole second base, and Walter Cannady would score Leonard on a sacrifice fly to center field to make it 2-1 after seven. The Barons had a serious threat in the latter half of the inning, getting the bases loaded on two singles and a walk, but Felix McLaurin would commit an out to end the inning. They would then add four runs in the ninth inning on the strength of three straight singles (Bankhead, Leonard, Hoskins), an error by the center fielder, a walk, and a two-run single by Edsall Walker with two out. The Barons had two runners on base with no out and then two out but scored zero runs to end the game. For the Grays, Walker would allow just one run on five hits while striking out two batters and walking three, and Alfred Saylor allowed six runs on eight hits with four walks and five strikeouts.\nGame 3.\nA hit in the second inning by Ted Radcliffe was all that the Black Barons could muster against Ray Brown, who pitched a one-hitter shutout with three walks and five strikeouts. Earl Bumpus allowed nine runs on eleven hits with six walks and strikeouts. Homestead got the first run on the board in the second inning, starting with a leadoff single by Dave Hoskins that was followed by a single by Josh Gibson that scored Hoskins. The fifth inning proved decisive for Homestead, who scored four runs on the strength of two hits (singles by Brown and Cool Papa Bell), a sacrifice bunt, a hit by pitch, and errors by Birmingham's second and third basemen. The seventh proved no better for the Black Barons, who saw a single by Sam Bankhead eventually turn into a run after two wild pitches were thrown by the pitcher. The next inning saw them get two outs but it was followed by a single by Jerry Benjamin and a walk to Bankhead before singles by Buck Leonard and Dave Hoskins scored the runners. A single by Bell in the final frame scored Cannady (who reached on an error) to end the scoring.\nGame 4.\nJohn Huber threw a complete-game shutout while allowing just three hits with four walks and six strikeouts. Spoon Carter went five innings for the Grays and would prove to be the only Gray starter in the Series to not throw a complete game. He allowed five hits and two runs with a walk and strikeout before being taken out for Edsall Walker. Walker allowed four runs to score on six hits with four strikeouts for four innings.\nGame 5.\nRoy Welmaker closed the Series out for the Grays by allowing just two runs to score on eight hits while striking out six batters. The Barons had trouble early with pitching that cost them dearly, as starter Alfred Saylor allowed four runs to score on seven hits with three walks before being replaced by Alonzo Boone with one out in the fourth inning. Boone allowed four hits with one walk and three strikeouts."

        "title": "1945 Negro World Series",
        "text": "In the 1945 Negro World Series, the Cleveland Buckeyes, champions of the Negro American League, swept the Washington Homestead Grays, champions of the Negro National League, four games to none.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe two teams were evenly matched in pitchers (who each allowed six hits on 33 batters), with a little bit of timing and luck proving the difference in Cleveland prevailing in the opening game. Cleveland broke the scoreless drought in the seventh inning. Catcher Quincy Trouppe collected the lone extra base hit for the team on his triple to start the inning, and Johnnie Cowan helped him score on a sacrifice fly. In the eighth, first baseman Archie Ware hit a single to left, and a walk got him to second base, where right fielder Willie Grace lobbed a single into right field to score Ware for what proved to be the go-ahead run. The Grays threatened in the final frame with a one-out single by Dave Hoskins that was followed by a walk to Buck Leonard. Josh Gibson lined a single to center field to make it 2-1 and put Leonard on third. However, Sam Bankhead would hit the ball right to shortstop Avelino Canizares that he relayed to Cowan at second base, and he relayed it to Ware at first base to complete the double play that ended the game. Buckeye starter Jefferson hurled a complete game while allowing just six hits and one earned run while striking out four and walking two batters. Grays starter Welmaker threw eight innings and allowed two runs while walking three and striking out seven. The two teams followed the game the next day with an exhibition game played in Dayton at Hudson Field, which Homestead won 3-1, while Game 2 took place two days after that.\nGame 2.\nHomestead took a lead midway through the game, but they could not hold it together late. Buck Leonard started the fourth inning with a single to right field, and Josh Gibson followed him with a double to left field. A fielder's choice and a flyout meant that the game was 1-0 with two outs, and a Jelly Jackson single was followed by a ground out to end the threats for more. In the fifth, Cool Papa Bell started the inning with a single, and he advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt. With two outs and Bell on third, a balk by the pitcher led to Bell scoring what proved to be the final run for the Grays. In the seventh, the Buckeyes would tie the score on the strength of hitting and timing. Willie Grace started the inning with a home run to right field to make it 2-1. Buddy Armour lined a double with one out to center field; with two outs, Eugene Bremer hit a ball to second baseman Jackson that he would bobble and make an error on, which led to Armour scoring. Avelino Canizares lined a single to keep the inning alive with two runners on, but Archie Ware hit a flyout to end the threat. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Quincy Trouppe started the inning with a double to center field. Facing Armour, Wright had one of his pitches go wild, which meant that Trouppe went to third as the potential winning run. Armour (who went 1-for-3 in the game) would be walked intentionally afterwards, and he rewarded it by stealing second base not long after. Johnnie Cowan (0-for-3 in the game) would then be intentionally walked to load the bases with no out with the pitcher in Gene Bremer to bat. He proceeded to line a double to right field, which scored Trouppe, Armour, and Cowan as the Buckeyes snatched Game 2 of the series.\nGame 3.\nThe Buckeyes gripped the Grays with a shutout that left the defending champions on the brink despite having left more runners on base than Cleveland (eight to six). Starter George \"Jeff\" Jefferson threw a shutout while allowing three hits with five walks and three strikeouts, while Roy Welmaker allowed four runs on seven hits with two walks and five strikeouts. The trouble for the Grays started in the third inning, as catcher Josh Gibson would drop a foul fly hit by Avelino Canizares, and the batter was soon walked. A bunt attempt by Archie Ware led to an error by Welmaker and two runners on with no out. A forceout was followed by a single to get runners on second and third for Willie Grace, who responded with a flyout to the outfield to score Ware. Quincy Trouppe was intentionally walked to set up runners at second and third. Buddy Armour would line a two-run single to center to give the Buckeyes a 3-0 lead (entirely of unearned runs). The game stood quiet until the ninth, when Cleveland added onto their lead after Jefferson grounded out to score Armour (who led the game with a 3-for-3 performance), who had singled to start the inning. Vic Harris was the final out for the Grays, shutout for just the 4th time in 20 games played in the Series over the past four seasons.\nGame 4.\nThe Homestead Grays had made it to the Negro World Series four consecutive times (with two championships won), but they would end the fourth one just as they had done the first time around in being swept. Cleveland started the proceedings with two runs in the first; Avelino Canizares had a leadoff single, which was followed by a walk to Archie Ware and a single by Sam Jethroe. With the bases loaded for Parnell Woods, he hit a ball to second baseman Bozo Jackson that he could not get a hold on (with no assist from right fielder Dave Hoskins). While Woods was called out at second, two runs had scored on the error, which was followed by two quick outs to close the inning. In the fourth, the Buckeyes started with two straight singles by Willie Grace and Quincy Trouppe that were followed by a ground out and a flyout (by Johnnie Cowan) that made it 3-0 Cleveland. The scoring popped once more in the seventh, as a Sam Jethroe two-out single scored runners on second and third (who had gotten there on a single and an error). Sam Bankhead was the final out for the Grays, who like the Buckeyes had left six runners of base. For the Buckeyes, starter Frank Carswell threw a complete-game shutout while allowing just four hits with three walks and one strikeout and a hit batsman. For the Grays, Ray Brown had allowed ten hits with five runs (two earned) with a walk and a strikeout.\nAlthough the series formally ended there, the two teams would play three exhibition games in the span of the next three days; the game on September 22 was played in Wilmington Park in Wilmington, Delaware (won by Cleveland 4-1), while Yankee Stadium hosted a doubleheader between the two the following day (which Homestead won 7-1 in both games)."

        "text": "In the 1946 Negro World Series, the Newark Eagles, champions of the Negro National League, beat the Kansas City Monarchs, champions of the Negro American League, four games to three.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nGame 1 matched Hilton Smith for Kansas City and Leon Day for Newark, but each would not factor in the final decision, while each team lost a player due to injury. Newark third baseman Clarence Isreal was lost for the game in the third inning due to dislocating his knee while running into the stands for a foul ball (he was replaced by Benny Felder). Monarch shortstop Jim Hamilton was lost in the fifth inning due to suffering a compound fracture in his right leg on a play at the plate (he would be replaced by Chico Renfroe).\nKansas City started the proceedings with the first run in the opening inning with Hank Thompson hitting a leadoff single. However, right fielder Bob Harvey would commit an error on the play, and Thompson advanced all the way to third base. Herb Souell would follow him with a single to right that scored Thompson. A single by the next batter was followed by a double play and a subsequent out to quell the threat for more.\nThe Monarchs blew a key chance in the fourth inning for runs. The bases were loaded on two walks and a single and one out, but Hilton Smith and Hank Thompson committed outs to end the threat. Newark had their own blown chance in the fifth inning, when they had two baserunners on with one out, but Jimmy Wilkes and Benny Felder both committed outs to keep the game at 1–0. Smith was replaced after the fifth inning, having allowed five hits while walking two batters and striking out four. Day would follow in being replaced in the fifth, having allowed four hits while walking four and striking out six. In for Smith was Satchel Paige while in for Day was Rufus Lewis, with each proving to allow four hits in four innings, but Paige proved the most effective, as he allowed no runs to score while striking out eight. Newark broke through in the sixth inning. Second baseman Larry Doby was walked by Smith (who in turned was replaced by Paige). Doby stole second base, but Monte Irvin and Lennie Pearson struck out. With two outs, Johnny Davis hit a single to right that tied the game.\nKansas City responded in the seventh inning, starting on a single by Paige that got him to second base when Doby committed an error. With two outs, Souell hit a single to left that scored Paige and gave them a 2–1 lead. The Eagles would hit a single in each of the last three innings but fail to send a runner home, with Cotton Williams striking out to end the game.\nGame 2.\nThis was the first time since Game 3 of the 1942 Negro World Series that each team hit a home run, and it saw Kansas City blow a 4–1 lead in the seventh inning. Acting as starter was Ford Smith for Kansas City while Max Manning started for Newark. The Eagles started the scoring when Larry Doby drew a two-out walk. Monte Irvin lined a double that scored Doby. Kansas City equaled the game in the fifth inning, starting with a leadoff single by Buck O'Neil, who advanced to second base on an error by center fielder Jimmy Wilkes. After a batter struck out, Chico Renfroe lined a single to right field that scored O'Neil.\nKansas City cracked open the game in the sixth inning. Herb Souell hit a leadoff single, and Ted Strong laid a successful bunt that ended up getting him to first base when Manning committed an error. Willard Brown proceeded to hit a home run that made the score 4–1. However, Newark responded the next inning. Wilkes started by lining a leadoff single. After a strikeout, Doby stepped to the plate with one out. He hit a home run that made the score 4–3. After a walk to Irvin, Smith was replaced by Paige for his second straight relief appearance. Lennie Pearson lined a single to left that scored Irvin and tied the game, and an error by left fielder Johnie Scott got him to second base. A single by Johnny Davis scored Pearson to break the tie. A strikeout meant that Leon Ruffin stepped to the plate with two out. He responded with a single that scored Davis, and the throw by right fielder Strong rolled through third baseman Souell's legs, which meant that Ruffin advanced to third on the play. Manning, up to bat, singled to right to score the sixth and final run of the inning to make a 7–4 lead.\nKansas City had one last chance in the ninth inning, when Renfroe hit a one-out single and H. Smith drew a walk that put two baserunners on with one out. However, Paige hit the ball to second baseman Doby, who threw to Pearson for a double play that ended the game. Manning pitched a complete game in allowing four runs on six hits with three walks and eight strikeouts for Newark. For Kansas City, Smith allowed four runs to score on eight hits on innings while walking five and striking out twice, while Paige pitched innings and allowed three runs on four hits with one strikeout.\nGame 3.\nLeniel Hooker of the Eagles was matched against Jim LaMarque of the Monarchs. Kansas City started the scoring in the first inning, with one-out singles by Herb Souell and Hank Thompson resulting in runners on the corner. Catcher Leon Ruffin would allow a passed ball that resulted in a run when Souell advanced to home. Newark responded in the second inning. Monte Irvin and Lennie Pearson hit singles; two outs followed, but the runners advanced to third and second base. Ruffin made up for his error by lining a single that scored both runners and gave them the lead. When Kansas City came to bat in the bottom half of the inning, they responded in kind. Buck O'Neil hit a leadoff single and then stole second base. This was followed by a walk to Johnie Scott and a force-out that meant runners were on first and second with one out. LaMarque would hit a single that scored Scott, and Chico Renfroe followed him with a single that loaded the bases. One batter later, Thompson would line a two-out single that scored three runs after shortstop Irvin committed an error, with the result being that the score was 5–2 in favor of Kansas City. The Monarchs piled on the runs by scoring a run in each of the next three innings. Hooker was pulled after four innings of work, having allowed six runs on nine hits while walking a batter. He was pulled for Cotton Williams, who pitched the next three innings. Newark would cut into the lead in the seventh, starting with a walk to Pat Patterson and a single by Larry Doby. A force-out and a sacrifice out resulted in two runs scoring.\nThe eighth inning proved to be undoing for the Eagles, who saw a three run deficit turn into a ten run blowout. It started with four straight singles, which resulted in two runs, while an out by Brown scored another run. Ted Strong would hit a one-out home run that made it 13–5. It was followed by an out and then a combination of three singles and a walk that resulted in two runs. Williams was pulled at last after it was 15–5, having allowed nine runs to score in his innings of work (doing so on 11 hits), replaced by Max Manning. He drew a hit and a groundout to end the inning. Larry Doby ended the game on an out in the ninth inning that gave Kansas City a 2–1 series lead. LaMarque pitched a complete game while allowing five runs on seven hits with three walks and eight strikeouts.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 matched Rufus Lewis for the Eagles against Ted Alexander of the Monarchs.\nKansas City scored the first run of the game in the second inning on the strength of a leadoff single by Willard Brown, who advanced to second on a stolen base and then went to third and home on outs made (the latter on a fly to center by Buck O'Neil). Ultimately, Kansas City would score just one run in the game, having just four hits while only having one in the first three innings each and in the sixth inning. Newark responded in the next inning. Jimmy Wilkes hit a one-out single, which was followed by Pat Patterson advancing on an error. One batter (and out) later, Monte Irvin hit a two-out single that would score Wilkes and then score Patterson after catcher Earl Taborn committed an error.\nIn the fifth, Newark cemented their lead on the strength of four hits (Wilkes, Larry Doby, Irvin, and Lennie Pearson) and an error committed by Kansas City that resulted in two runs while Alexander was replaced by Satchel Paige (however, it did not stop Doby when he attempted to steal home plate from third base, which succeeded). The runs continued in the next inning, starting on a one-out walk to Ruffin that was followed by a Rufus Lewis single and a Wilkes double that scored a run before Doby hit a triple that cleared the bases (he also committed the last out when trying to stretch the triple into an inside-the-park home run). Irvin scored the final run of the game in the seventh inning on a leadoff home run to right field.\nLewis threw a complete game while allowing one run on four hits with six strikeouts. Alexander allowed four runs to score on six hits while going innings and walking two with one strikeout. Paige pitched the remaining innings while allowing four runs to score on eight hits with three strikeouts and one walk.\nGame 5.\nGame 5 matched Max Manning against Hilton Smith, and each pitcher went the distance, the first of just two games in the Series where the bullpen wasn't needed for each team. Manning went eight innings but allowed five runs to score on nine hits with three walks and seven strikeouts, while Smith went nine innings and allowed just one run on ten hits with a walk and three strikeouts.\nBoth teams had roughly the same amount of hits and baserunners left on, but Kansas City made more out of their opportunities to win (Newark for example left two baserunners in each of the first three innings). It started in the fourth inning, as Hank Thompson drew a leadoff walk. He made his way to second base after a pop-out and a strikeout, and Johnie Scott got him to third with a single. Ford Smith, playing at right field in the seven-hole spot, would hit a single to center that scored Thompson.\nIn the sixth, Kansas City added on to the lead. Thompson hit a leadoff double and then advanced to third on a ground out. Buck O'Neil then hit a sacrifice bunt that scored Thompson. Scott then hit a triple to left, which was followed by an intentional walk to Smith with two out. However, Manning would throw a wild pitch that allowed Scott to race home from third to make it 3–0. In the next inning, Hilton Smith and Chico Renfroe each would hit a single. Two batters later, Willard Brown hit a two-out double to right that scored the runners and made it 5–0. Newark scored their only run of the game when Lennie Pearson hit a one-out double to score Monte Irvin from first base.\nGame 6.\nGame 6 matched Leon Day against Jim LaMarque, but in a unique circumstance, neither pitcher would commit a single out for their teams, as each team exploded in offense in the first inning, while Monte Irvin became the first and only player to hit two home runs in a Negro World Series game.\nIn the top of the first inning, Day allowed two singles and an error that set up Willard Brown at the plate. Brown hit a home run to left field that made it 4–0, and Day was replaced on the mound by Leniel Hooker (Day stayed in the game, moving to center field). Hooker allowed the first two runners to reach before a single by Earl Taborn drove the fifth run in to score. In the bottom half of the frame, LaMarque issued walks to Hooker, Clarence Isreal, and Larry Doby, loading the bases. He was pulled for Steve Wylie. A force-out on Irvin generated one out, but a single by Lennie Pearson scored two runs. A wild pitch by Wylie narrowed the score to 5–3. An intentional walk put runners on the corner with two out, and Leon Ruffin responded with a single to make it 5–4. Newark took the lead in the second inning, doing so on the strength of a walk issued to Hooker, who was driven home three batters later on a home run to left field by Irvin to make it 6–5. They added on to their lead in the fourth inning, when Pearson hit a one-out home run to left field after Irvin had hit a single. Kansas City responded in the next frame when W. Brown hit a leadoff single and Buck O'Neil hit a home run that made it 8–7. The next run proved to be the last one, and it was scored by Irvin on a home run to right field in the sixth inning, and O'Neil committed the final out in the ninth inning as the Eagles proved victorious.\nWylie had pitched innings in relief and allowed five runs to score on eight hits while walking two and striking out two before being taken out for Ted Alexander (who had pitched the closing innings of one-run ball). Hooker had pitched nine innings in relief while allowing three runs on eight hits with one walk and three strikeouts.\nGame 7.\nThe final game matched Rufus Lewis of Newark (the Game 4 winner) versus Ford Smith (making his second start after doing Game 2).\nNewark never trailed during the first Game 7 of the Negro World Series since 1943. With one out, Pat Patterson reached first base when second baseman Hank Thompson committed an error. Larry Doby drew a walk to have two batters on with one out. Monte Irvin then hit a single to right that scored Patterson and gave the Eagles a 1–0 lead at the end of the first inning.\nKansas City had left a base runner each of the first five innings but came up with nothing. In the sixth inning, however, Buck O'Neil hit a home run to left field that tied the game. The Eagles responded in the bottom half of the frame, starting when Doby and Irvin both reached base on walks. With two outs, Johnny Davis hit a double to left that scored both runners on base and made the score 3–1. Kansas City inched closer in the seventh inning; Joe Greene reached on a single and stole second base before Ford Smith hit a single to put runners on the corner. Herb Souell hit a two-out single to narrow the score to 3–2, but Hank Thompson committed an out to close the inning.\nIn the closing inning, Kansas City reached base twice with a single by Smith and a walk to Chico Renfroe (which occurred after a critical single by Taborn failed because he tried to make it to second base and was called out). With two outs, Souell popped out to first baseman Lennie Pearson to end the game and give Newark the championship. Ford Smith pitched eight innings and allowed three runs on three hits with seven walks and two strikeouts for the Monarchs. For Newark, Rufus Lewis pitched nine innings and allowed two runs on eight hits with four walks and eight strikeouts."

        "title": "1947 Negro World Series",
        "text": "The 1947 Negro World Series was the championship tournament for the 1947 season of the Negro leagues. It was the sixth edition of the second incarnation of the Series and the tenth overall played. It was a best-of-seven playoff played between the Negro National League New York Cubans and the Negro American League Cleveland Buckeyes.\nThe Cubans won the Series in six games, winning four while having one game called a tie due to rain after six innings.\nBackground.\nThe Cleveland Buckeyes were making their second appearance in the World Series after winning the NAL pennant (they subsequently beat Washington in four games for the title). In a time where both leagues had teams play an uneven amount of games, Cleveland had a winning percentage of .778 with their 42-12 record, which exceeded the Kansas City Monarchs (52-32, .619) for the pennant.\nAs for the Cubans, they had started play in the NNL in 1935 but had disbanded for two years before returning in 1939. They were part of a distinct history that had employed many international players that ranged beyond just Cuba, such as Puerto Rico. With a record and percentage of 43-19-1 (.694), they outmatched the Newark Eagles (50-38-1, .568).\nThis would ultimately prove to be the penultimate Series ever played by the two Negro leagues. Integration of black players into Major League Baseball in 1947 had shifted attention in the newspapers and crowds away from the Negro Leagues as defectors like Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby took center stage for the National League and American League.\nBuckeyes Al Smith, Sam Jethroe, Quincy Trouppe, Webbo Clarke, and Sam Jones would join the major leagues in the following years while Cubans Minnie Minoso, Ray Noble, Pat Scantlebury, and Lino Donoso made it to the majors.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe first game of the series would end up proving very little, despite the potential for it. The Buckeyes chased the Cubans' starting pitcher in Dave Barnhill out after one inning on three runs in five hits, and they rocked Pat Scantlebury for two more runs for a total of five in two innings. However, Scantlebury settled down and allowed no further runner to score for the next four innings, and New York gradually chipped at the lead over the next few innings, which included three runs in the fifth off starter Chet Brewer. Both teams relied on chance hitting, since each had two extra base hits (Cleveland had five singles and New York had six). The best hitter of the day proved to be shortstop Silvio Garcia of the Cubans, who went 3-for-3 with an RBI and two runs. However, growing rain meant that the game was called a tie after six innings.\nGame 4.\nCatcher Ray Noble would help lead the Cubans to victory with a grand slam in the fifth inning as the Cubans went from a one-run lead to being up 7-0 as Cleveland did themselves no favors by committing four errors.\nGame 6.\nIn the Series, Cleveland had a lead in the first two games, yet managed to win just once. Games 3-5 saw them lead in exactly zero innings, but Cleveland finally broke some ground to start Game 6 at home. They rocked Luis Tiant Sr. for three runs as he faced just eight batters in two innings before being relieved for Scantlebury. He held the ship mostly afoot despite the fact that Cleveland would lead 5-0 at one point, but he went the distance of seven innings, and New York soon came alive in the sixth inning, doing so on the strength of two hits, a hit-by-pitch, and two straight errors to make it 5-3. Ultimately, they would make the best of two doubles and six singles to go with seven walks and four errors committed by Smith to score six runs in three innings as Cleveland (mustering three doubles on nine hits with only three walks) could only watch as the Cubans clinched the title. Three players in the game had three-hit games, which included Scantlebury (3-for-5), Willie Grace (3-for-4 while driving four runs in), and Leon Kellman (3-for-5).\nNew York was buoyed by two .400 hitters in the Series in Minnie Minoso (.423) and Claro Duany (.421), while only Leon Kellman hit exceptionally for Cleveland, leading the way with a .450 average."

        "title": "1948 Negro World Series",
        "text": "The 1948 Negro World Series was the championship tournament for the 1948 season of Negro league baseball. It was the seventh edition of the second incarnation of the Negro World Series and the eleventh overall played. It was a best-of-seven playoff played between the Homestead Grays of the Negro National League and the Birmingham Black Barons, champions of the Negro American League. The Homestead Grays played home games in both Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. It was the fifth appearance for the Grays in the Series, the most for any team; Birmingham made their third appearance in the Series, with each being against the Grays (losing in 1943 and 1944). The Grays won the series in five games. The Black Barons featured the 17-year-old Willie Mays in his first professional season.\nBackground.\nInterestingly, the Negro National League and Negro American League each had held a Championship Series to determine their respective pennants, which was the first time since 1939 (the National League held ten total series matchups, while the American League held just five matchups). There would not be an occasion again that baseball of any kind saw a \"Championship Series\" until Major League Baseball did so on a regular basis in 1969.\nIn the NAL Championship Series, Birmingham faced the Kansas City Monarchs. The Black Barons won the first three games by one run each, but Kansas City responded with wins in Game 4, 6, and 7; the fifth game had ended prematurely in the fifth inning in a 3–3 tie. The eighth and deciding game ended with the Black Barons winning 5–1 to clinch the championship.\nIn the NNL Championship Series, Homestead, managed by Vic Harris, faced the Baltimore Elite Giants (coincidentally, the last time Baltimore had competed in the postseason was against the Grays in 1939). Homestead won the first two games, but a controversial non-finish in the third game eventually led to the championship. In that game on September 17, the score was 8–4 with Homestead at bat in the top of the ninth inning, but the game was called because of an 11:00pm curfew, and the game had initially reverted to the score at the end of the last completed inning (i.e. 4-4 after eight innings). Game 4 happened two days later, and Homestead lost that game 11–3. After the game, the NNL ruled that Game 3 would be replayed from when that game was stopped - with Homestead up 8–4. Baltimore forfeited the game in response, and Homestead was awarded the NNL championship, the final one to be awarded. This was the tenth Negro National League pennant for the Grays, with Harris having led the team to eight of them as manager.\nSummary.\nThe first three games of the series were close, with the Barons missing chances in the first two games to avoid losing in the ninth inning (losing Game 1 after a play at the plate and losing Game 2 while having the tying run at the plate with a groundout). The Black Barons won Game 3 with their young star Mays in hand, who aided the team with speed and the glove, and it was his groundball hit through the pitcher in the ninth inning, that helped drive the runner on second base home to win it for Birmingham. However, that proved to be the only gasp of magic the team had, as the Grays dominated the Barons in the following two games to win the Series.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Grays were out hit 8–6 (while facing four less batters than the Barons), but they had two doubles and one triple while the Barons had just one extra base hit (a double) as the Grays rode to victory on a three-run inning in the second. The hit leader for the game was catcher Pepper Bassett, who hit 3-for-4 for the Barons; Dave Pope made his one hit count for the Barons in scoring two runs on his triple in the third (he was then driven in by Luis Marquez three batters later).\nGame 2.\nFor Game 2, the series moved to Birmingham's Rickwood Field for a night game. Bob Thurman of the Grays faced Bill Powell of the Black Barons. Thurman pitched a complete game, but Powell was knocked out after innings, and Jimmie Newberry finished the game for Birmingham. The Black Barons took the lead in the bottom of the second when they loaded the bases on a single by Piper Davis, a walk by Ed Steele, and another single by Jim Zapp. Joe Scott then hit a double, driving in two.\nThe Grays scored five in the top of the fifth. Luis Márquez led off with a single, and Luke Easter followed with a double. Buck Leonard was intentionally walked to load the bases, and Wilmer Fields hit into a fielder's choice that scored the first run. Eudie Napier doubled, driving in two more, and the Grays' third baseman hit a home run to make it 5–2. The Black Barons scored one run in the ninth, but the Grays held on to win 5–3. The Grays were ahead two games to one.\nGame 3.\nGame 3 was played at Rickwood Field the following night. Tom Parker started for the Grays facing Alonzo Perry of the Black Barons. Birmingham scored a run in the bottom of the third, and in the top of the fourth the Grays tied it with a solo home run by Luke Easter. In the bottom of the inning, Parker pulled a muscle, so R.T. Walker came in to relieve. In the bottom of the sixth, Walker gave up two runs, giving the Black Barons a 3–1 lead.\nIn the top of the eighth, Perry gave up two runs to the Grays, tying the game at 3 runs apiece. He was relieved by Bill Greason, who held the Grays scoreless in the top of the ninth. In the bottom of the ninth, 17-year-old Willie Mays came to bat with two runners on base and two outs. He drove the ball up the middle to drive in the walk-off, game-winning run. The Black Barons narrowed the Grays lead to two games to one.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 moved to Pelican Stadium in New Orleans and was played on Sunday, October 3. Wilmer Fields started for the Grays and pitched a complete game. Bill Greason started for the Black Barons, but he was knocked out early and Jehosie Heard, Jimmie Newberry, and Nat Pollard took turns in relief. The Grays scored four runs in the second inning. In the fifth inning, they added on five, four of which came from a grand slam hit by Luke Easter, his second home run of the Series. The Grays added on three more runs in the fifth and two in the eighth for a 14–1 win. The lopsided win put the Grays ahead three games to one.\nGame 5.\nThe teams returned to Birmingham for Game 5, a night game held on Tuesday, October 5. It was the last Negro World Series game, and the last game played by the Negro National League, which disbanded after the season. R.T. Walker was the starter for the Grays and Bill Powell for the Black Barons. Bill Greason relieved Powell in the sixth inning.\nEntering the top of the ninth, the Grays trailed 6–5. They tied the game on a pair of doubles hit by Luis Márquez and Luke Easter. The game went to extra innings, the Grays scored four runs in the top of the 10th on three walks, two singles, and a double. The Black Barons brought in Sam Williams to relieve Greason, but it was too late. The Grays sent in Wilmer Fields to pitch the bottom of the 10th, and he shut down the Black Barons to secure the Series win.\nAftermath.\nThis proved to be the last great moment for the Grays, who left for the Negro American Association when the Negro National League disbanded. Of the six team in the NNL, four teams joined the Negro American League: the Newark Eagles (who moved to Houston), New York Cubans, Philadelphia Stars, and the Baltimore Elite Giants, while the New York Black Yankees did not stay on. The Grays played in the NAA for one season but found themselves in financial trouble, and they disbanded the following year. Buck Leonard retired that same year and he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1972. The NAL continued on until 1962, barnstorming to lessened crowds, and the Barons won one further league title in 1955. By that time, Mays had become a star for the New York Giants, where he would play for over two decades and eventually become inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1979."

        "title": "1926 Colored World Series",
        "text": "The 1926 Colored World Series was the championship tournament for the 1926 season of Negro league baseball. It was the third overall Series played. It matched the Chicago American Giants, champions of the Negro National League (1920–1931), and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, New Jersey, champions of the Eastern Colored League. Initially planned as a best-of-nine series, two ties meant that the series went eleven games. Chicago won just once in the first six games, but games 1 and 4 had ended in ties, meaning that they only trailed three games to one when the Series shifted to Chicago. They were down to their final game after losing the eighth game, but the Chicago American Giants proceeded to win the next three games to complete the comeback and win their first ever World Series.\nClaude \"Red\" Grier of the Bacharach Giants pitched a no-hitter in Game 3. No pitcher would throw a no-hitter in a postseason game in the major leagues until Don Larsen did so thirty years later.\nBackground.\nThis was the second postseason for the Negro leagues to involve a Championship Series played prior to the World Series. The Negro National League Championship Series involved the champions of the split season in the Kansas City Monarchs (first-half) and the Chicago American Giants (second half), which like the World Series was also a best-of-nine series, with the first four games in Kansas City and the remaining games in Chicago. The Giants lost four of the first five games (with Game 4 being the only win). However, the Giants proceeded to win four consecutive games at home, however, to clinch the pennant, which included three games decided by one run and a Game 9 that ended in the fifth inning with a 5–0 win. It was their fourth league title, all done in the span of six years.\nBacharach Giants.\nJohn Henry Lloyd, who had managed the Atlantic City Bacharach Giants in 1925, left the team and signed as manager with the Lincoln Giants after the Bacharach Giants attempted to reduce his salary. The Bacharach Giants' shortstop, Dick Lundy, was promoted to player-manager in his place, returning to the post he had held in 1923 before Lloyd's arrival.\nAt the winter meetings, the Eastern Colored League admitted the Newark Stars (also known as the Newark ABC's) to the league as the eighth team. The seven teams that had finished the previous season were the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, the Baltimore Black Sox, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, the Cuban Stars (East), the Harrisburg Giants, the Hilldale Club, and the Lincoln Giants of New York. The two leagues also announced a $3,000 maximum monthly salary limit for each team. The league, then in its fourth year, was attempting to play a 70-game full-season competition, but had experienced problems in enforcing a uniform schedule. The league decided that a team if a team failed to play at least 50 league games, it would not be eligible to compete in the Colored World Series, or to have claim to the money awarded to the second or third place clubs. The season began on May 1.\nEarly in the season, the Bacharach Giants trailed in the race. On May 23, their record was 2–7, placing them in seventh place, trailing the league-leading Harrisburg Giants. By June 28, their record had improved to 9–12 and they had inched into sixth place, ahead of the Brooklyn Royal Giants and the last place Newark Stars. The Cuban Stars were in first place with a 10–3 record. A week later, the manager of the Newark Stars announced that they would quit the league and disband, leaving the league with seven teams. And although the Brooklyn Royal Giants remained in the league, they were rumored to be planning to leave the league the next season as they had only played six games and were disregarding the league schedule. Instead of playing league games, they were playing semi-pro teams in Brooklyn or barnstorming in upstate New York. In the month of July, the Bacharach Giants took off, winning 13 straight games, before losing to the Cuban Stars on July 26.\nDuring August, the Cuban Stars clung to their lead in the pennant race, with the Bacharach Giants, the Harrisburg Giants, the Hilldale Club, and the Lincoln Giants all remaining in the mix. But by August 31, the Bacharach Giants had moved into first place with a 31–20 record. A week later, the Bacharach Giants were solidly in first place with a 33–20 (.623) record and four games remaining before the scheduled September 15 end of the season. The second-place Harrisburg Giants had a 25–17 (.595) record, and the third-place Hilldale Club had a 34–24 (.586) record. (Because of the unbalanced schedule, championships were awarded to the team with the highest winning percentage.) An article in the \"Afro-American\" newspaper provided a retrospective of the season, saying that with the Bacharach Giants' move from also-ran to first place, \"The Bacharach Giants have astonished the world in the last six weeks.\"\nChicago American Giants.\nOver the winter, Rube Foster, the co-owner and manager of the American Giants (as well as president of the Negro National League), engaged in a series of trades and transactions designed to overhaul and rebuild his aging team. He traded for Rube Curry, who had pitched for the victors of 1925 Negro World Series—the Hilldale Club. He traded for outfielder George Sweatt from Kansas City, pitcher Robert Poindexter and outfielder Sandy Thompson from the Birmingham Black Barons, sending away long-time American Giants players Cristóbal Torriente, Juan Padrón, and Bingo DeMoss (who went to manage the Indianapolis ABCs). From the Memphis Red Sox, which had forfeited its NNL franchise, he picked up Sanford Jackson, Charlie Williams, and catcher Pythias Russ. Third baseman Dave Malarcher was named as captain of the team.\nThe Memphis and the Birmingham teams, which had played in the NNL in 1925, left to join the new Negro Southern League and did not renew their franchises, which were returned to the league. Their players were distributed to other teams. A new franchise was approved for the Cleveland Elites, owned by Sam Shepard of St. Louis; Candy Jim Taylor was named as the team's manager. The league would have eight teams—the Chicago American Giants, Cleveland Elites, Cuban Stars (West), Dayton Marcos, Detroit Stars, Indianapolis ABCs, Kansas City Monarchs, and St. Louis Stars. Bullet Rogan took over as player-manager of the Monarchs, and Arvell \"Bill\" Riggins became the player-manager of the Detroit Stars. The schedule called for the season to open on May 1, with the league playing two halves and the winners of each half playing a league championship series.\nThe defending champion Monarchs jumped to an early lead in the race, winning all of their first nine games of the season and 13 of their first 15, with the American Giants in second place winning 10 of their first 13. On May 18, however, the Monarchs suffered a tragic setback when their star shortstop, Dobie Moore, was shot in the leg by a girlfriend, resulting in compound fractures that would end his professional baseball career. The American Giants immediately retook the lead in the race, with Kansas City dropping to third. But the Monarchs quickly rebounded and regained the lead, winning two consecutive series, eight of nine games, against the American Giants. The first half race finished on July 5 with Kansas City winning it with a 35–12 record. Detroit (34–17) was in second place and Chicago (28–16) in third.\nTwo weeks into the second half, the league's weakest team, the Dayton Marcos, withdrew from the league and folded. A week later the Cleveland Elites also quit. The Cuban Stars had initially announced that they would return early to Cuba, but when Cleveland withdrew the Stars decided to stay and allow the league to continue with six teams. Meanwhile, the American Giants jumped to an early lead in the second half race by going 22–1 in their first 23 games. In late August, American Giants manager Rube Foster experienced a nervous breakdown after several weeks of exhibiting erratic behavior. He was taken into custody at his home by police and, after several days of observation, was committed to the mental asylum at Kankakee State Hospital. Dave Malarcher took over the management of the team. With a 29–7 record, the American Giants won the second half, narrowly edging the second-place Monarchs.\nThe NNL League Championship Series was a best-five-of-nine contest played from September 18 to 29. The series opened in Kansas City, where the Monarchs won the first three games, 4–3, 6–5, and 5–0, before the American Giants won the fourth game 4–3. Traveling to Chicago to play the remainder of the series, the Monarchs won the fifth game 11–5, leaving them ahead four games to one. The Chicago Giants, however, rallied to win the next two games by scores of 2–0 (a shutout by Curry) and 4–3.\nOn September 29 the Monarchs were still leading four games to three with a doubleheader scheduled. If the American Giants won, the teams would play a second, five-inning game and the winner would board the train to Atlantic City for the World Series. The teams' ace pitchers, Foster and Rogan, faced off in a great pitching duel. Both were pitching shutouts as the game went to the bottom of the ninth. Jackson beat out a roller to third, Foster sacrificed him to second, and with two outs, Thompson singled to drive in the winning run. When Rogan (the Monarchs' manager) saw that Foster was warming up to start the second game also, he decided to go back himself, taking the ball from Chet Brewer who had been scheduled to start. The decisions worked out better for the American Giants as Foster pitched his second shutout in one day. Chicago beat Kansas City 5–0, thereby clinching the league championship and a berth in the World Series.\nSeries Plans.\nAs late as the beginning of September, \"Chicago Defender\" sportswriter Fay Young wrote that \"there might not be any world series this year\" because the Cuban Stars (East) were narrowly leading the Eastern Colored League pennant race. There were concerns that the Cuban squad did not have a park and would not generate enough attendance to cover the expenses of a series. By mid-September the leagues had agreed to a best-five-of-nine-game series, with the first four games to be held in the East with games split among Atlantic City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and the last five games played in the West.\nRosters.\nAtlantic City's regular lineup consisted of Willie Jones as catcher, Chance Cummings as first baseman, Chano García as second baseman, Oliver Marcelle as third baseman, Dick Lundy as shortstop and manager, Ambrose Reid in left field, Chaney White in center field, and Luther Farrell in right field. Their starting pitchers were Arthur \"Rats\" Henderson, Claude Grier, Alonzo Mitchell, and Hubert Lockhart, and Roy Roberts was a relief pitcher. Their bench included outfielder Elias \"Country\" Brown and backup catcher Joe Lewis.\nChicago's regular lineup consisted of John Hines as catcher, Jim Brown as first baseman and backup catcher, Charlie Williams as second baseman, Dave Malarcher as third baseman and manager, Sanford Jackson as shortstop, Sandy Thompson in left field, George Sweatt in center field, and Floyd Gardner in right field. The pitching staff included starting pitchers Willie Foster, Rube Curry, Willie Powell, George Harney, and Webster McDonald, and relief pitcher Sam Crawford.\nSeries.\nGame 1.\nThe series opener in Atlantic City ended in a 3–3 tie when it was called after nine innings due to darkness. Curry started for the American Giants and pitched into the eighth inning, when he was lifted for Foster. Henderson went the distance for the Bacharach Giants. Mayor Edward L. Bader threw out the first pitch.\nIn the top of the second, Jackson came to bat with the bases loaded and no outs. He reached base on a fielder's choice hit to the pitcher; Henderson's throw home was high and wide allowing Hines to score with Chicago taking a 1–0 lead. The Bacharach Giants avoided further damage when Henderson struck out Curry and Sweatt was thrown out trying to score on a passed ball.\nThe Bacharach Giants took the lead in the bottom of the fourth, when White, Lundy, and Farrell hit consecutive singles with two outs, driving in two runs. In the top of the sixth, the American Giants regained the lead when Jackson batted again with the bases loaded, this time with two outs. He singled to right, driving in Sweatt and Malarcher and giving Chicago a 3–2 lead.\nIn the bottom of the seventh, the home team evened the score when Farrell hit a one-out home run over the right field fence. In the bottom of the eighth, the Bacharach Giants threatened again, loading the bases with two outs for Farrell. Foster, who just two days earlier had pitched two shutouts in a doubleheader to clinch the championship, came in to relieve Curry and struck out Farrell. Neither team scored in the ninth, and the game was called on account of darkness.\nGame 2.\nThe original schedule called for an off day on Saturday, October 2, but due to the tie in the first game, a second game in Atlantic City was hastily arranged. The American Giants took an early lead that the Bacharach Giants were unable to overcome, as Chicago won 7–6. Harney of the American Giants was the winning pitcher, while Grier took the loss for the Bacharach Giants.\nThe Bacharach Giants took a 1–0 lead in the bottom of the first on a sacrifice fly by Marcell. In the top of the second, though, the American Giants broke the game open. After five singles, a walk, and a hit batter, the American Giants had taken a 4–1 lead and had the bases loaded with two outs when Hines came to bat for the second time in the inning. Grier fell behind Hines with a 3–0 count, and Lundy brought in Lockhart to relieve and try to get the home team out of the jam. Hines then hit a triple to deep left field, driving in three and putting the American Giants ahead 7–1.\nThe Bacharach Giants chipped away at the American Giants lead. In the bottom of the third, Malarcher hit a double to right-center that drove in two, making the score 7–3. In the bottom of the sixth, the Bacharach Giants loaded the bases with one out after a single, a walk, and a hit batter. García singled to center, driving in two runs and knocking Harney out of the game. McDonald was brought in to relieve him, but he walked Lockhart to load the bases again. Reid then singled off the short fence in right field driving in another run, but the right fielder Gardner quickly fielded the ball and fired it home, so García retreated to third. The catcher Hines then noticed that Lockhart had rounded second, so he fired the ball to the shortstop, Jackson, picking off Lockhart. Meanwhile, García broke for home but was thrown out at the plate. During the play, García collided with Hines and the impact knocked him out for several minutes, but he was able to return to the game. The inning was over, and the American Giants still led 7–6. Chicago held on to the lead and that was the final score.\nGame 3.\nOn October 3, the Bacharach Giants beat the American Giants 10–0, as Claude Grier made baseball history by pitching the first no-hitter in a Colored World Series. Grier accomplished this feat the day after he had started and lost Game 2, knocked out in the second inning and giving up seven runs. While holding the American Giants hitless and striking out eight, Grier walked six batters and two American Giants reached base on errors. The \"Chicago Defender\" said that Grier \"deserves all the credit in the world, although we have to remind our readers that Marcell, Lundy and Garcia pulled off some of the most phenomenal fielding that we have seen...\" The losing pitcher, McDonald, went 7 innings and was charged with all 10 runs, of which four were unearned. Crawford pitched a scoreless eighth inning for the American Giants. The Atlantic City victory evened the Series at one game apiece.\nThe game was played in Baltimore. The weather was unusually hot, and attendance was disappointing for a Sunday game in the larger city.\nIn the bottom of the first, Reid led off for the Bacharach Giants reaching base and advancing to second on a throwing error by Jackson. Cummings singled to right, then Marcell bunted to a single, scoring Reid. White also tried bunting and reached base and advanced to second on a throwing error by Malarcher, with Cumming scoring. Lundy followed with a single to right scoring Marcell and White, and the home team was ahead 4–0 before having made an out.\nThe American Giants threatened a rally in the top of the fifth when Malarcher led off with a walk. With two outs, McDonald reached base on a sharply hit ball to first that got past Cummings. The scoring official ruled it an error, though some fans said it should have been recorded as a hit, which would have ended Grier's no-hit bid. This was followed by a walk issued to Gardner, loading the bases. But Thompson hit a come-backer to the pitcher and was thrown out, ending the inning.\nIn the bottom of the sixth, the Bacharach Giants scored six more runs to break the game open. García, leading off the inning, was hit by a pitch, and Grier doubled to left. Reid singled to center, scoring García. Then Cummings singled to center, driving in Grier, and Sweatt misplayed the ball allowing Reid to score and Cummings to advance to second on the error. Marcell singled, advancing Cummings to third, and White hit a sacrifice fly to score him. Lundy grounded into a fielder's choice to shortstop for the second out, and Farrell followed with a single advancing Lundy to third. Farrell and Lundy then attempted a double steal. The throw arrived to the catcher in time to tag out Lundy, but Hines dropped the ball and Lundy scored on another error (the fourth by the American Giants). Then Jones doubled, driving in Farrell to make it 10–0.\nGame 4.\nThe fourth game ended in a 4–4 tie when the game was called due to darkness after nine innings. It was played in Philadelphia under unseasonably hot weather. Henderson started for Atlantic City and Foster for Chicago, and both starting pitchers threw complete games. \"Chicago Defender\" columnist Fay Young blamed the pair of tied games called for darkness (Games 1 and 4) on slow pace of play and the decision by Eastern Colored League officials to start the games at 3:00 rather than 2:30, remarking, \"This time of year it gets dark early.\"\nThe American Giants scored twice in the top of the first. Gardner led off with a single to left, followed by a single to right by Malrcher that advanced Gardner to third. After a sacrifice bunt advanced Malarcher to second, Hines hit a fly to left that scored Gardner, while Malarcher advanced to third on the throw to the plate. Sweatt then hit a two-out single to right scoring Malarcher. They added another run in the fourth when Sweatt hit a one-out double to right-center. With two outs, Jackson doubled down the right field line driving in Sweatt and making it 3–0.\nIn the bottom of the fifth the Bacharach Giants scored four to take the lead. García led off with a walk, then with two outs Cummings singled. Marcell grounded to shortstop, but Jackson made a wild throw to first base, allowing García to score and the runners to advance to second and third. White singled to right, driving in both runners to tie the game. Lundy followed him with a triple to deep center scoring White and putting the Bacharach Giants ahead 4–3. In the sixth inning, the Bacharach Giants threatened to add on when García led off with a triple for the Bacharach Giants. Henderson flied out to right, and García attempted to score but was thrown out at the plate by Gardner, so the score remained 4–3.\nThe American Giants evened the score in the seventh. The first two batters, Jackson and Williams, both hit bunt singles. Foster hit a sacrifice bunt to advance the runners. With two outs, Jackson attempted to steal home and scored when Henderson's pitch got past the catcher, which was ruled as a passed ball. When the ninth inning ended with the score still tied, the game was called because of darkness.\nGame 5.\nChicago American would blow a lead for the third time in five games, and this time it would cost them a win. They began the game with a lead on a series of unearned runs in the first inning that meant three runs on zero hits and three errors committed by Bacharach. Jelly Gardner started the game with a walk by pitcher Alonzo Mitchell, and a passed ball by catcher Willie Jones meant he went to second base. The next batter in Dave Malarcher would advance to first base on an error by first baseman Chance Cummings that gave Gardner enough time to score form second. A sacrifice bunt and an error led to runners on the corner, and a sacrifice groundout by George Sweatt scored Malarcher. An error by shortstop Dick Lundy on the next batter would score John Hines from second base.\nThe game would stay that way until the fifth inning, when Bacharach made their charge, doing so on the strength of seven hits and two errors. Starting the proceedings was Jones, who started the inning with a single off Chicago starter Rube Curry. After a flyout, pitcher Alonzo Mitchell scored the first run on his second hit of the game (he would go 3-for-4) on a triple. Ambrose Reid would hit a single to center field that would score Mitchell, and Chance Cummings followed him with a single, with an error by Curry leading to runners on second and third base with one out. Oliver Marcell broke the game open with a hit to right field that scored Reid, and an error committed by catcher John Hines led to Cummings scoring to make it 4-3 and Marcell made it to third base. A fielder's choice resulted in the second out and a runner on second base, but Dick Lundy doubled off Curry to drive in Chaney White, and Luther Farrell followed him with a single that chased out Curry from the game; he threw innings while allowing 11 total hits and six runs with one strikeout.\nChicago inched closer in the subsequent inning, starting with a hit by Malarcher and a walk to Sandy Thompson, and they went to third and second base on a sacrifice bunt. A subsequent strikeout meant two outs for Jim Brown, but he would line a triple to right field to score two runs and narrow the deficit to 6–5. However, Sanford Jackson grounded out to the first baseman to end the inning.\nBacharach closed the scoring in the seventh inning after Chaney White had started the inning with a walk and stole second base before a two-out double by Jones drove White home. Chicago managed to get a runner on first base in the final inning on a hit by Jackson, but two force-outs closed the game out as Alonzo Mitchell finalized a 2–1 series lead for Bacharach. He pitched a complete game while allowing four hits and five runs (two earned) with three strikeouts and walks.\nGame 6.\nBacharach withstood a brief rally by Chicago to close the New Jersey end of the Series with a win to go up three games to one (with two ties) in the Series.\nBacharach started the scoring in the first inning. A leadoff single by Ambrose Reid was followed by two outs but him on second base and Dick Lundy scored him hin with a double to the outfield to make it 1–0. In the next inning, Chano García lined a two-out walk, and a walk to Claude Grier was followed by a single by Reid to make it 2–0. Chicago would get their chance to even it up in the fourth inning. Dave Malarcher hit a leadoff bunt for a single, and Sandy Thompson also lined a bunt successfully for a hit (the next batter would try to bunt as well, but he only succeeded in advancing the runners). George Sweatt lined a single to left to score two runs and tie the game. A bunt led to an error and two men on with one out, but two straight outs led to the game still tied after four.\nBacharach broke the tie with a run in each of the next four innings. In the fifth, Reid had a triple to leadoff the inning and Oliver Marcell bunted him home. In the sixth, Reid had a two-run single to score Alonzo Mitchell from second base after he had a single earlier. In the seventh, Marcell had a leadoff double and Lundy would score him after his sharp grounder to the third baseman resulted in an error. In the eighth, each team scored runs. Chicago had a leadoff double by Powell and a walk by Gardner, and Hines scored Powell and Gardner on a two-out single to make it 5–4. Bacharach followed with a leadoff single by García that was eventually scored in by Chance Cummings on a double. Chicago had a leadoff walk, but the 7-8-9 hitters all hit outs to close out the game. Willie Powell pitched eight innings while allowing six runs (five earned) on twelve hits with two walks and two strikeouts. Claude Grier allowed four runs on six hits and three walks.\nGame 7.\nChicago blew a lead for the fourth and final time in the Series, but a late rally gave them a win to make the series 3–2.\nBacharach started the scoring in the third after two ground outs led to Ambrose Reid at bat. He hit a double to right field, and Chance Cummings scored him in with a single to right to make it 1–0. Chicago followed in the fourth inning after having loaded the bases on a single, an error, and a hit by pitch. Charlie Williams would help score a run when starting pitcher Hubert Lockhart threw a walk. Chances for more were dashed when the runner on third was picked off, but the game was tied. On their next chance to bat in the fifth, they broke the game open. With one out, Jelly Gardner lined a single that was followed by a walk to Dave Malarcher. Sandy Thompson would line a double into left field that scored Gardner. One batter later, George Sweatt hit a triple to center that cleared the bases and gave them a 4–1 lead.\nBacharach would chip away at the lead late in the game. In the seventh inning, Willie Jones hit a leadoff double to right field. One batter later, Hubert Lockhart hit a single to left to score Jones and make it 4–2. In the eighth inning, Oliver Marcell hit a leadoff single to right field, and Chaney White followed it with a triple to left to cut the game to 4–3. A sacrifice fly by Joe Lewis score White to make it 4-4.\nThe game was decided in the ninth inning. Starter Hubert Lockhart had gotten the leadoff hitter to pop-out, but he was replaced after Dave Malarcher had hit a single and stole second base. Lockhart had allowed nine hits in innings with four walks and one strikeout. He was relieved for Arthur \"Rats\" Henderson. Henderson got Sandy Thompson to strikeout to make it two outs with a runner on second for John Hines. However, a passed ball by catcher Willie Jones advanced Malarcher to third base. Hines responded with a single to right field that scored the winning run. Bill Foster had allowed four runs on eight hits with three walks and five strikeouts.\nGame 8.\nBacharach inched one closer to winning the Series with a shutout win over the Giants that included a complete-game shutout by Arthur \"Rats\" Henderson. By the time of the eighth inning, Bacharach had left six runners on base combined, while Chicago had left three behind.\nCountry Brown started the eighth inning with a single through second base. Chance Cummings followed that up by advancing to first base on an error by first baseman Jim Brown. A wild pitch by starting pitcher George Harney meant that there was runners on third and second base, and Oliver Marcell was soon intentionally walked. With Chaney White at the plate, he belted a single to left field that left fielder Sandy Thompson would have trouble fielding after it landed, and the result was that White cleared the bases and advanced to second base. The scoring subsided afterwards on two groundouts and a flyout, but Bacharach led 3–0.\nThe two teams each had a chance in the ninth for further scoring. Bacharach had the bases loaded with two out on the basis of a single and two walks, but a strikeout ended the threat. Chicago responded with a leadoff walk by Jelly Gardner, but a pop-out and a force-out meant that Sandy Thompson was at first base with two out, although a single by John Hines put the tying run at the plate in George Sweatt. However, he flied out to right field to end the game. Henderson threw a complete-game shutout while allowing just three hits while striking out seven and walking two. Harney allowed three runs (one earned) on six hits while walking six and striking out two.\nGame 9.\nChicago mustered runs early and withstood a potential rally to stay alive in the Series.\nChicago started the second inning by getting on bases by walks to John Hines and George Sweatt. Hines was picked off second, and a ground out meant there was two outs with one on first. However, Sanford Jackson would line a triple to left field to score Sweatt, and Charlie Williams responded with a single to make it 2–0. In the fourth, a two-out double by Jim Brown was rewarded after Jackson hit a single to make it 3–0. In the sixth, walks to Hines and Sweatt led to a RBI single by Brown. Jackson would drive in a run on a fielder's choice, while a passed ball by the catcher led to another run.\nBacharach had their only scoring in the eighth. Dick Lundy singled to leadoff the inning, and Luther Farrell followed with a single. Willie Jones had a double to make it 6–1, while Chano García made it 6–3 on a single (with an error by the catcher); a double play got García out at home to end the scoring. In the ninth, they garnered a single but no further hitting to end the game.\nClaude Grier threw eight innings while allowing six runs (four earned) on seven hits, six walks, and nine strikeouts. Rube Curry threw a complete game while allowing three runs on eight hits and having seven strikeouts.\nGame 10.\nChicago continued their chance to stay alive in the Series with an onslaught of timely hitting to rout Bacharach. Ten batters went to bat in the fourth inning, and seven scored on seven hits and one error (committed by first baseman Chance Cummings that scored George Sweatt for the first run on a ball hit by Willie Powell) to make it 7-0 Chicago. Starter Arthur \"Rats\" Henderson (four innings, seven runs (all unearned) on nine hits with three walks and a strikeout) did not last to see the fifth inning, replaced by Roy Roberts (four innings, three hits, six runs (five earned), six walks, one strikeout). He would allow four runs to score on the basis of two hits, an error, and three walks. In the sixth inning, an error, a passed ball, and two walks meant the bases were loaded with no one out, and Jelly Gardner doubled to score two runs and close the game at 13–0. Willie Powell threw a complete-game shutout while allowing six hits with a walk and a strikeout.\nGame 11.\nThe final game of the Series proved to be the most dramatic, and Chicago would win it all on a walk-off in the ninth despite Bacharach having numerous chances to score in a rematch of Game 7, which had also come down to the final inning.\nBacharach had the first glance at a run in the first inning. With two outs, Dick Lundy and Chaney White each lobbed singles to center field, and Joe Lewis walked to load the bases. However, starting pitcher Willie Foster got Chance Cummings to strike out to end the inning. The next threat was in the fourth inning for Bacharach, who started with singles by Lewis and Cummings. However, a force out and two pop-outs led to no runs. They had the next threat in the seventh when they loaded the bases with two singles and a walk, but a flyout by Chaney White to center fielder Jelly Gardner ended that threat. Chicago never even reached third base until the eighth, when Jim Brown had a walk and advanced to third on two plays for outs, but Foster soon committed an out to end the inning.\nBoth teams would have their chance to take the lead in the ninth inning. Bacharach gained a baserunner when Chano García hit a single, although that was followed by a strikeout and a force-out that had Country Brown at first. He would go for stealing second base, and an error by catcher Brown meant that he was on third base with two out. Oliver Marcell walked to have runners on the corners, but Lundy grounded a ball to shortstop Sanford Jackson, who threw to first baseman George Sweatt to keep the game tied at 0. In the bottom half of the frame, Jelly Gardner started it with a single to left, and he was advanced to second base on a sacrifice bunt by Dave Malarcher. With Sandy Thompson at bat, he would line a walk-off single to center field that left enough for Gardner to race to home plate and win the Series for Chicago.\nBill Foster had allowed ten hits but had thrown a complete-game shutout with seven strikeouts and three walks for Chicago; Hubert Lockhart had thrown innings and allowed four hits with one run allowed and a strikeout and a walk."

        "text": "The 1927 Colored World Series was the championship tournament for the 1927 season of Negro league baseball. It was the fourth overall Series played. It matched the Chicago American Giants, champions of the Negro National League (1920–1931) and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, New Jersey, champions of the Eastern Colored League. The Giants won the series five games to three (with one tie). The two teams had faced a year earlier in the 1926 Colored World Series with the same result.\nThis time around, it was Chicago that had to hold back a comeback, since they had won the first four games (all played in Chicago) and needed just one more to clinch the Series. They proceeded to lose three of the next four while tying Game 6, which meant that there could have been a Game 10 if Chicago did not win in Atlantic City. They prevailed 11-4 in Game 9 to prevail and win their second straight title. It was the last Negro World Series played for fifteen years.\nIn Game 5, Luther Farrell of the Bacharach Giants pitched a shortened no-hitter, allowing no hits in a 7-inning complete game that was called early due to darkness. \nBackground.\nTo get to the World Series, the Giants had to win the NNL Championship Series against the Birmingham Black Barons. The Giants won Game 1 5-0 and Game 2 10-5 before dropping Game 3 6-5 to close out the Birmingham part of the Series. In Chicago, they won Game 4 6-4 and clinched the pennant with a 6-2 win on September 25. \nSeries.\nGame 1.\nFor Atlantic City, starter Luther Farrell pitched eight innings while allowing six runs on eight hits while walking one and striking out six and hitting two batters. Willie \"Bill\" Foster allowed two runs on thirteen hits while walking two batters and striking out eight.\nGame 2.\nAtlantic City would use two pitchers for the game. Jesse Hubbard was pulled after pitching four innings and allowing nine runs on eleven hits while striking out one batter. Hubert Lockhart pitched the remaining four innings while allowing two runs to score on three hits with one walk and three strikeouts. Willie Powell allowed one run to score in nine innings while allowing four hits with three walks and five strikeouts.\nGame 3.\nAtlantic City would use three pitchers during the game in another rout loss. Hubbard was used as the starter for the second straight game. He was replaced after allowing the first two baserunners to advance in the third inning (totaling four hits and four earned runs). Roy Roberts faced two batters and allowed the runners and one more to score on two hits. Hubert Lockhart handled the remaining six innings, allowing two runs to score on four hits with one strikeout and on walk. Meanwhile, George Harney threw a complete-game shutout, allowing just four hits while walking one batter and striking out eight.\nGame 4.\nLuther Farrell went eight innings and allowed nine runs to score on eleven hits with six walks and one strikeout, while Webster McDonald pitched nine innings and allowed one run on six hits while walking one and striking out four.\nGame 5.\nTo the derision of the Chicago teammates, the game was called after seven innings with Atlantic City winning. According to reports in the \"Chicago Defender\", the team started to yell obscene gestures at the box seats where Postmaster Alford and the mayor were sitting. Willie Foster pitched six innings and allowed three runs on five hits while walking three and striking out three. Luther Farrell pitched a shortened no-hitter of seven innings while walking five and striking out three. Chicago scored in the fourth inning the basis of an error committed by Oliver Marcell that helped Steel Arm Davis get on base; he stole second and third base before Willie Jones committed an error that led Davis to score. The second run scored in the fifth inning when Larry Brown walked and eventually reached home on an error committed by Cool Turner.\nGame 6.\nThe game ended after ten innings due to darkness. This was the first Negro World Series game to have all the runs scored by each team to be composed entirely of home runs. Chicago starter Willie Powell went six innings and allowed one run on six hits while walking two batters and striking out four. He was pulled for Eddie Miller, who pitched to one batter in the seventh inning (after Powell had allowed the first two runners to advance) before being pulled for George Harney. He went innings and allowed two hits, one walk, and two strikeouts. For Atlantic City, Hubert Lockhart pitched ten innings while allowing five hits and one run, walking two and striking out five. Bacharach left nine runners on base (three times with two runners on) while Chicago left five.\nGame 7.\nGeorge Harney allowed eight runs on eleven hits in eight innings of work while walking five and striking out three. Luther Farrell pitched a complete game while allowing one run on seven hits, six walks, four strikeouts, and two hit batsmen.\nGame 8.\nWebster McDonald started the game for Chicago, but he would only last four innings. In the fifth inning, he allowed a leadoff triple and two singles that tied the game (in total, he allowed eight hits with one walk and four strikeouts). Willie Foster was brought in to relieve him with a batter on first. An error would later bring the runner home. Chicago went from being up 4-2 to being down 5-4. Foster would pitch four innings and allow two hits with one run while walking two and striking out one. Jesse Hubbard pitched nine innings for Atlantic City, allowing five runs on six hits with four walks and four strikeouts.\nThe game turned in the eighth inning that inspired controversy as the 5-5 tie was broken. It started with a leadoff double by Clarence Smith, which was followed by a Willie Jones single (followed by a stolen base). Pinch hitter Ambrose Reid hit a flyball to center fielder Sanford Jackson. The throw by Jackson was a long hard throw that went perfectly to catcher Jim Brown, who had the ball with him to block the plate. Smith, trying to run home, ran outside the baseline and even ran into the shortstop on the play, but he eventually found a path to home plate and was deemed to have scored. The argument soon grew heated between the Chicago players and the umpires and fifteen Chicago police officers were brought to the field to restore the peace. Brown was ejected and three position players switched positions. Chicago went down in the ninth inning and lost the game.\nGame 9.\nChicago starter Willie Powell pitched one inning and allowed a run to score with two walks and a strikeout before being pulled for Willie Foster. He threw five innings while allowing three runs to score on eight hits and walking three with one strikeout before Rube Curry was brought in to save the eighth and ninth inning, and he pitched two perfect innings to close an 11–4 win. For Atlantic City, starter Hubert Lockhart pitched innings and allowed five runs to score on three hits while walking four before being pulled for Luther Farrell. He pitched the remaining innings and allowed six runs on 11 hits with one walk and nine strikeouts."

        "text": "The 2014 Royal Rumble was the 27th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on January 26, 2014, at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the first WWE pay-per-view event to be held in this arena since it opened in August 2010. It was the first Royal Rumble to be held in the city of Pittsburgh. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2014 event, the winner received a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXX; this was the first time since 2002 in which there was only one eligible championship for the Royal Rumble winner to challenge for.\nThe event featured five professional wrestling matches, including one match on the Kickoff pre-show. The main event was the 2014 Royal Rumble match. A returning Batista won by last eliminating Roman Reigns to become a two-time Royal Rumble winner. Also on the event's card, Randy Orton successfully defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena, Bray Wyatt defeated Daniel Bryan, and Brock Lesnar defeated Big Show. On the event's Kickoff pre-show, The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) defeated Goldust and Cody Rhodes to become the new WWE Tag Team Champions.\nThe event is known for the overwhelmingly negative crowd response during the Orton–Cena title match, as well as towards the end of (and after) the Royal Rumble match, when the fans booed the Rumble winner Batista, repeatedly chanted for Daniel Bryan (who had competed earlier in the night and was not involved in the main event), and rooted for man in place, Roman Reigns (who was a heel at the time). Fans worldwide (including retired wrestler Mick Foley) voiced their displeasure over social media, and the event was covered by many major news outlets as one of the worst Royal Rumble pay-per-views. However, the bout between Daniel Bryan and Bray Wyatt was highly praised by fans and critics. The event also marked the last WWE pay-per-view appearance of CM Punk for nearly a decade, as he walked out on the company the next day despite still being under contract and retired from professional wrestling later that year; he would make his return to wrestling by debuting in rival promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) in August 2021, and would later make his return to WWE at in his hometown of Chicago in November 2023, and subsequently be featured in the 2024 event, marking his first televised WWE match in a decade.\nThe event received 467,000 buys, down 8.8% from the 512,000 buys for the previous year's event.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2014 event was the 27th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 26, 2014, at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which opened in August 2010 replacing the former Mellon Arena, making the first WWE pay-per-view held in this venue, although the arena was originally going to host the 2012 Survivor Series. On the final episode of \"Raw\" before the Royal Rumble event, Batista returned to WWE after an absence of nearly four years, and the Royal Rumble match was scheduled to be his first return match.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania Main Event. For 2014, the winner received a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXX. It was the first Royal Rumble since the 2002 event to only feature one world championship, as the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship were unified as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at in December 2013.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised five matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nA highly promoted match featured WWE World Heavyweight Champion Randy Orton defending the title against long-time adversary John Cena. At Survivor Series in November 2013, Orton successfully defended his WWE Championship against Big Show, on the same night the World Heavyweight Champion John Cena defeated Alberto Del Rio to retain his title. After Orton's victory at Survivor Series, Cena came down to the ring with his title, and celebrated with the crowd as The Authority (Triple H, Stephanie McMahon, and Kane) looked on, much to Orton's chagrin. The next month, at the pay-per-view, Orton defeated Cena in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to unify the two titles into the new WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 30 episode of \"Raw\", Cena was awarded a rematch for the title against Orton at the Royal Rumble, with the match stipulation of a traditional one-on-one singles match, except that it could be won by pinfall or submission only. On the January 13 episode of \"Raw\", Orton suffered an upset loss to Kofi Kingston and took out his frustrations by attacking Cena's father, who was attending the event at ringside.\nOn the December 30, 2013, episode of \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar returned with his manager, Paul Heyman, to announce his intentions to challenge the winner of the upcoming WWE World Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Orton and John Cena at the Royal Rumble. Lesnar then dared any wrestler who disapproved of that notion to challenge him, which was answered by Mark Henry, and a brawl would ensue, ending with Lesnar delivering an F-5 to Henry. The following week on \"Raw\", Henry challenged Lesnar again, only to have Lesnar dislocate his elbow with the Kimura lock in storyline, which led Big Show to come out afterwards to confront Lesnar. On the January 10 episode of \"SmackDown\", Big Show issued a challenge to Lesnar, Paul Heyman accepting on behalf of Lesnar and scheduling the match for the Royal Rumble event.\nAnnounced on WWE.com, Goldust and Cody Rhodes faced The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the Royal Rumble Kickoff Show preceding the pay-per-view. This match was made when The New Age Outlaws defeated Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a non-title match on the January 17 episode of \"SmackDown\" due to a distraction from Vickie Guerrero.\nOn the October 28, 2013, episode of \"Raw\", The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, and Erick Rowan) attacked Daniel Bryan backstage, which ignited a feud between the two. The next month at Survivor Series, Bryan teamed with CM Punk and defeated Harper and Rowan. The rivalry between Bryan and the Wyatt Family continued in December, as the latter defeated the former in a 3-on-1 handicap match at TLC, with Wyatt attempting to recruit Bryan in the previous weeks. On the December 30, 2013, episode of \"Raw\", Bryan defeated Harper and then Rowan in a gauntlet match so that he could face Wyatt, whereupon Harper and Rowan interfered for a disqualification and beat him down, before announcing he would join the Wyatt Family. However, on the January 13, 2014, episode of \"Raw\" (after Bryan and Bray Wyatt were defeated by Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso in a Steel Cage match), Bryan betrayed Wyatt and attacked him, culminating with Bryan hitting his flying knee finishing maneuver on Wyatt. The following week on \"Raw\", Bryan explained that his joining the Wyatts was a ruse to infiltrate the stable and bide his time to strike, and that he would wrestle Wyatt at the Royal Rumble event.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nBefore the show aired live on pay-per-view, the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show was shown live on YouTube and other digital platforms. Backstage, the general managers of Raw and SmackDown, Brad Maddox and Vickie Guerrero, respectively, rolled the \"Rumble Drum\" to give wrestlers their numbers. Alberto Del Rio, R-Truth, The Real Americans (Jack Swagger and Antonio Cesaro), Kofi Kingston, The Great Khali, and Damien Sandow picked their numbers during the segment.\nIn the pre-show, Goldust and Cody Rhodes defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn]). Towards the end of the match, Rhodes applied a dropkick to Dogg, but was unaware that Gunn blind-tagged in for the latter. From the back, Gunn entered the ring and delivered a Fame-Ass-er to Rhodes, to win the match and the titles for the Outlaws.\nPreliminary matches.\nIn the first match on the pay-per-view portion of the show, Bray Wyatt faced Daniel Bryan. Early in the match, the referee saw Bray's Wyatt Family members Luke Harper and Erick Rowan attempting to interfere, so he ejected them from ringside. During the match, Wyatt targeted Bryan's head, ramming it into the ring-post. Bryan later mounted a comeback with a running tornado DDT off the ring apron, planting Wyatt's head on the floor. Wyatt managed to escape Bryan's Yes! Lock submission hold by biting Bryan's hand. To avoid Bryan's running knee, Wyatt rolled out of the ring to the floor. Bryan then attempted a suicide dive but Wyatt caught him and executed a Sister Abigail into the barricade. After another Sister Abigail in the ring, Wyatt scored the pinfall victory.\nIn the next match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) faced Big Show. Lesnar attacked Big Show before the match started, and then hit him with a chair. When the match started, Big Show landed his KO Punch, but Lesnar picked up the victory after executing an F-5. Lesnar then continued to attack Big Show with a chair after the match.\nIn the penultimate match, Randy Orton defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena. After both wrestlers failed to win despite executing their RKO, Attitude Adjustment, and STF moves, both wrestlers resorted to using their opponent's signature moves but still could not win the match. At the end of the match, Cena again trapped Orton in the STF submission hold, but the lights temporarily went out due to the arrival of The Wyatt Family on the ring apron. Orton took advantage of the distraction to drop Cena with the RKO to pin him and win the match.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the Royal Rumble match for a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. CM Punk and Seth Rollins were entrants #1 and #2; they spent the longest and second longest time in the match (49 and 48 minutes respectively). Kane entered at #5 and targeted Punk, but Punk managed to eliminate him. NXT's Alexander Rusev entered at #6. Kofi Kingston, who entered at #8, had two feats of athleticism to escape elimination; first after he was deposited on the guardrail by Rusev (who caught him when Kingston was thrown out of the ring) he jumped back to the ring apron from the guardrail, and later while he was hanging on to the bottom rope with his feet, he fended off Jack Swagger by snatching Swagger's boot and hitting him with it.\nRollins' Shield teammates (Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns) entered at #11 and #15 respectively. Goldust eliminated his brother Cody Rhodes 24 minutes into the match, and was in turn eliminated by Reigns, who had also eliminated Kingston and unannounced entrant Kevin Nash, amongst others. Midway through the match with only Punk and the Shield left in the ring, Sheamus returned to WWE television at #17 and momentarily stopped the Shield's dominance. Los Matadores' mascot El Torito entered at #20, and managed to eliminate Fandango, before being eliminated in turn by Reigns. Pay-per-view commentator John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield was announced as entrant #24, making it the first time the JBL character had participated in a Royal Rumble. He was eliminated by Reigns while handing his jacket to fellow commentator Michael Cole, whereupon he resumed his commentator role for the rest of the match.\nBatista entered at #28 and quickly eliminated Erick Rowan, Ryback and Alberto Del Rio. The final entrant at #30 was Rey Mysterio, who was eliminated by Rollins. When Ambrose tried to eliminate Reigns, Reigns retaliated by eliminating Ambrose, Rollins and Antonio Cesaro simultaneously, leaving himself, Punk, Sheamus and Batista as the final four. Though already eliminated, Kane returned to ringside and pulled Punk over the top rope to eliminate him, then executed a chokeslam through a broadcast table on Punk. Reigns eliminated Sheamus to set a new record for most eliminations in a Rumble match with 12, but Reigns was then thrown over the top rope by Batista, who won the match.\nReception.\nThe event sold out the Consol Energy Center with 15,715 people in attendance. The official buy total for the 2014 Royal Rumble event was 467,000, which was a decrease of 8.8% from the 512,000 of the previous year's event, but a 5.4% increase from the 443,000 of the 2012 event. This contributed to WWE's PPV revenue of $13.8 million for the first quarter of 2014 compared with $15.1 million for the first quarter of 2013. The 2015 Royal Rumble event received 145,000 purchases, a significant drop from the 2014 event, due to the fact that the latter was held prior to the launch of the WWE Network.\nThe negative reaction of the fans attending the event in Pittsburgh was so great that it was reported as one of the major news items coming out of the show, and described as the live audience engineering a \"takeover\" of the final two hours of the show. During the title match between John Cena and Randy Orton, fans booed both men and chanted for Daniel Bryan, amongst other chants such as \"this is awful\". The fans continued to chant for Bryan during the Royal Rumble match and so when Rey Mysterio (typically a fan favorite) was revealed as the final entrant (and therefore Bryan's possible participation in the match was ruled out) the fans booed Mysterio, chanted for Bryan and cheered Mysterio's eventual elimination. The crowd continued to boo when there were three wrestlers left in the match, but when only Batista and Roman Reigns remained, they cheered for Reigns (a villainous character at the time) over Batista and later booed Batista's victory as the event drew to a close. After the show went off the air, Batista (who had been presented on-air as a heroic babyface character) mocked Bryan and gestured his middle finger at the crowd. Aaron Oster of \"The Baltimore Sun\" wrote Mysterio \"received more boos than he's ever had in his WWE career\", and in the case of Batista, \"besides the fact that a supposed face was getting booed, the boos were stronger than any Rumble winner I can remember, including when Mr. McMahon won in 1999\".\nFans took to social media to display their displeasure towards the event. The BBC reported that regarding Bryan's exclusion from the Rumble match, \"many people have also expressed anger on social media, with the phrases #RoyalRumble, #WWE and Daniel Bryan all trending on Twitter\". The \"Herald &amp; Review\" described the reaction to the event as \"WWE's PR nightmare\", with the most \"liked\" comments on WWE's Facebook page within 24 hours of the event including \"worst PPV ever\", \"the sound of WWE dropping the ball\" and in reference to the WWE Network, \"no Bryan, no buy\". Retired wrestler Mick Foley criticized WWE management on social media, stating, \"Does WWE actually hate their own audience? I've never been so disgusted with a PPV\".\nDale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk of Canoe.ca rated the overall event as 6.0 out of 10. The Wyatt-Bryan bout was rated the highest at a \"fantastic\" 9.5 out of 10, the Cena-Orton bout, described as a \"sloppy affair that won’t go down among the best work from either man\" received 4.0 out of 10, while the Lesnar-Big Show encounter received 1.0 out of 10. They described the event as \"uneven\", and that \"the disapproval of the fans at the Consol Energy Center at how the Royal Rumble match went down will be the lasting memory for anyone who watched the show\".\nJames Caldwell of the \"Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter\" rated the Royal Rumble match 2.5 stars out of 5, commenting that \"well, that back-fired\". He wrote that the \"Rumble peaked about three-fourths through, then fell off the table at the end\", and described the Rumble winner Batista as \"out-of-shape\". Caldwell also rated the Bryan-Wyatt match 4.0 stars out of 5, describing it as \"easily Bray's best WWE TV match, great chemistry from both wrestlers\" in front of a \"hot, invested crowd\". Caldwell chose not to rate the Lesnar-Show match, commenting that it was necessarily short due to Show being injured going into the match. Lastly, Caldwell rated the Orton-Cena title match 2.0 stars out of 5.\nBenjamin Tucker, who attended the event and is also from the \"Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter\", rated the entire event 6.0 out of 10, saying \"the show began great but slowly lost steam before ending in a roar of jeers\". For the Rumble match, Tucker said that \"the first two-thirds especially were exciting, with several wrestlers being spotlighted well\", \"until lower-level players kept coming out in the final half of the match\". Tucker felt that \"Roman Reigns was the star of the match, even outclassing Batista. Where Batista stumbled around the ring like... well, an old, retired wrestler, Roman Reigns looked like an absolute monster\". For the opening match, Tucker felt that the \"deliberate pace didn't hurt the match in the slightest. Instead, it allowed Bray to keep using his character while in a competitive, big match situation\". For the rest of the matches, Tucker wrote that \"Lesnar looked like a relentless beast\", while \"Orton and Cena put on their most lifeless performance ever together. There was very little story to the match\" and \"no creativity at all\".\nThe following year's Royal Rumble was similarly marked by an extreme negative audience reaction towards the Rumble match and its winner, which some media outlets described as being even worse than the 2014 event. When Daniel Bryan was eliminated in the first half of the match, the crowd repeatedly chanted his name for the second half of the match while booing other wrestlers making their entrance to the match, including eventual winner Roman Reigns. Reigns, who had been portrayed as a heroic character, was booed after winning the main event, even after he received The Rock's endorsement, and The Rock was heckled for helping Reigns. Also, many fans took to social media to display their displeasure at Bryan's elimination and the winner of the Rumble match.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Royal Rumble event, CM Punk did not appear and was not mentioned on \"Raw\" the next day. Despite being advertised for the \"SmackDown\" taping on Tuesday, he also did not appear in front of the live audience. By Wednesday, WWE.com stopped advertising Punk for future events. It was reported by the \"Wrestling Observer\" that on Monday prior to Raw, Punk had legitimately walked out on WWE when he informed Vince McMahon that he was \"going home\". On February 20, McMahon indicated to investors that Punk was \"taking a sabbatical\". However, in an interview published in late May, Punk indicated that he had retired; he was questioned \"How does it feel to be retired at 35?\" and replied with \"It feels good.\" Punk's WWE contract subsequently expired in July 2014, thus making the Royal Rumble his final on-screen appearance.\nHowever, on an episode of Colt Cabana's \"Art of Wrestling\" podcast released in November 2014, Punk said that he was suspended for two months after walking out on the company in January and that after the suspension ended, nobody from WWE contacted him. Punk also told that when he reached out to them for unpaid royalties, he was given a run-around by company executives until he was handed his termination papers and was fired by WWE on his wedding day with April Mendez (better known as AJ Lee) in June 2014. The manner of firing was the last straw for Punk, stating that he would never return to WWE and that following a legal settlement with WWE there would be no further working relationship between them. The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise. Punk subsequently signed a contract to compete in the UFC in 2015. Punk had not appeared on WWE programming since then, though he did have multiple appearances on \"WWE Backstage\", a show broadcast by Fox Sports, who had a television deal with WWE. However, on August 20, 2021, Punk returned to professional wrestling when he signed with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) during The First Dance edition of its weekly program \"Rampage\". After Punk left AEW in August 2023, he returned to WWE that November at .\nThe post-Rumble \"Raw\" on January 27 began with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon (The Authority) addressing the Rumble event and mocking the audience for not getting what they wanted. When Daniel Bryan came out and confronted them about not being inserted into the Rumble match, and then demanded to be inserted into the Elimination Chamber match and refused to leave the ring until they did, he was attacked by the Shield, but was then saved by John Cena and Sheamus. As a result, Bryan, Cena and Sheamus later teamed together to take on the Shield in a 6-man tag match in which all three members of the winning team qualified to participate in the Elimination Chamber match (in which Randy Orton would defend his WWE World Heavyweight Championship) at the eponymous pay-per-view. During that match, The Wyatt Family interfered, causing the Shield to be disqualified and thus Bryan, Cena and Sheamus qualified for the Chamber match. Cesaro and a returning Christian also qualified for the Chamber match by defeating Dolph Ziggler and Jack Swagger respectively. For costing them the spots in the Chamber match, the Shield vowed revenge against the Wyatt Family, which set up a match between the groups at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view.\nAt Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton retained his WWE World Heavyweight Championship by winning the Elimination Chamber match against Daniel Bryan, John Cena, Cesaro, Christian and Sheamus. During the Elimination Chamber match, the Wyatt Family once again interfered to cause Cena's elimination from the match. Also at Elimination Chamber, Batista defeated Alberto Del Rio, with the negative audience reaction to Batista continuing, even prompting the audience to cheer Del Rio. Meanwhile, Bray Wyatt was victorious once again with the Wyatt Family defeating the Shield.\nBecause of the boisterous negative reaction, Batista responded to the audience on the February 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", saying he didn't come back to be liked, only to be the next WWE World Heavyweight Champion, thus turning into a villain in the process. The scheduled WrestleMania XXX main event was Orton versus Batista for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. However, on the March 10 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan and multiple fans \"occupied\" the ring and refused to leave, resulting in an irate Triple H agreeing to Bryan's demand for a match at WrestleMania, with the stipulation that the winner would be inserted into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at the event. At WrestleMania, Bryan was added to the match after defeating Triple H in the opening contest of the show, and would ultimately win the triple threat match, forcing Batista to submit and win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On May 12, Daniel Bryan announced that due to injuries, he would require neck surgery, which he underwent on May 15. Bryan was stripped of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority on June 9 as he was not healthy enough to defend his championship.\nCody Rhodes and Goldust failed to regain the WWE Tag Team Championship from The New Age Outlaws on the post-Rumble \"Raw\", as the match ended in no contest after Brock Lesnar attacked Rhodes and Goldust. The following week, they received another rematch for the titles in a steel cage match, which the Outlaws won. The Outlaws' reign ended on the March 3 episode of \"Raw\", when The Usos won the Tag Team Championship.\nFollowing Elimination Chamber, Wyatt feuded with Cena, with Wyatt wanting to prove that Cena's heroic act was a facade characteristic of \"this era of lies\" while also trying to turn Cena into a \"monster\". Wyatt went on to accept Cena's challenge for a match at WrestleMania XXX, which Cena won despite interference from Luke Harper and Erick Rowan. In May at Extreme Rules, Wyatt defeated Cena in a steel cage match, after repeated interference from the rest of The Wyatt Family and a \"demonic\" child. Their feud ended at Payback on June 1, where, in a Last Man Standing match, Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match. Cena won the vacated WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank on June 29.\nOn the February 24 episode of \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their complaints about Lesnar not being in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's challenge by stabbing Lesnar with a pen and chokeslamming him through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar would attempt to break the Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania. Lesnar defeated Undertaker after executing three F5s, thus ending the streak. In August 2014, Lesnar defeated John Cena at SummerSlam, capturing the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the process.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nKane was already eliminated when he returned to eliminate CM Punk later in the match.\nBy eliminating 12 men, Roman Reigns broke the record of 11, set by Kane in Royal Rumble 2001."

It took place on August 17, 2014, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the sixth and final consecutive year. This was also the first SummerSlam event to air on WWE's livestreaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February. It was also the first WWE pay-per-view to incorporate the new WWE logo but it would not be used on air and on the turnbuckle pads until the next night on \"Raw\". This would also be the last WWE pay-per-view to feature the championships with the scratch logo as all were updated with the new logo also on the following night's \"Raw\".\nEight professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's main card and one match took place on the Kickoff pre-show, which was streamed on the WWE Network. The main event saw Brock Lesnar defeat John Cena to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship for a fourth time. This was the first of six consecutive SummerSlams in which Lesnar competed in the main event match. In other prominent matches, Seth Rollins defeated Dean Ambrose in a lumberjack match, Stephanie McMahon defeated Brie Bella, and Roman Reigns defeated Randy Orton. The event had 147,000 buys (excluding WWE Network views), down from the previous year's 296,000 buys.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2014 event was the 27th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 17, 2014, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the sixth consecutive year. In addition to airing on traditional PPV, the event was available through WWE's livestreaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February, which made it the first SummerSlam to air on the WWE Network.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised nine matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television programs, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nAt Payback, Brie Bella quit WWE after her husband Daniel Bryan was given an ultimatum by the principal owner of WWE Stephanie McMahon to either forfeit the WWE World Heavyweight Championship or have Brie fired. Brie decided to quit and slapped Stephanie in the face. After that incident, McMahon would repeatedly put Brie's twin sister Nikki Bella in matches which invariably ended with Nikki being beaten down. On the July 21 episode of \"Raw\", Brie returned to WWE as a fan in the audience to support her sister, but was slapped in the face by McMahon, who came to ringside to confront her. Later that night, Stephanie was arrested by the police for assault and battery, due to Brie not being part of the WWE roster. The next week on \"Raw\", Brie confronted Stephanie and said that she would drop the charges as long as Stephanie rehired her and accepted her challenge to a match at SummerSlam, which Stephanie accepted. On the August 11 episode of \"Raw\", Stephanie brought in Megan Miller, Bryan's physical therapist, who confessed to having an affair with her client. An infuriated Brie stormed into the ring and slapped Megan before attacking Stephanie. Later that night, Brie was arrested by the police after Stephanie revealed that Megan was pressing charges against her.\nAt Battleground, AJ Lee defeated Paige to retain the WWE Divas Championship. On the July 21 edition of \"Raw\", Paige attacked AJ after they defeated Emma and Natalya. On the July 28 edition of \"Raw\", AJ confronted and attacked Paige. On the August 1 edition of \"SmackDown\", after AJ defeated Rosa Mendes, Paige attacked AJ and threw her off the stage ramp, resulting in AJ suffering a whiplash injury. On August 4, it was announced on WWE.com that AJ would defend the title against Paige at SummerSlam.\nOn the June 30 episode of \"Raw\", Chris Jericho made his unexpected return to the WWE, only to be attacked by The Wyatt Family. This led to a match at Battleground, where Jericho defeated Bray Wyatt. On the July 21 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho was to have Wyatt on his Highlight Reel show, but the Wyatt Family attacked Jericho in the locker room. On the July 28 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H made the official announcement of the Wyatt-Jericho rematch at SummerSlam. On the August 1 edition of \"SmackDown\", Jericho defeated Erick Rowan, banning Rowan from ringside during the match at SummerSlam as per match stipulation. On the August 4 edition of \"Raw\", Jericho defeated Luke Harper by disqualification due to interference by Wyatt, causing Harper to be banned from ringside.\nAt Battleground, John Cena defeated Randy Orton, Kane, and Roman Reigns to retain the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar returned to the WWE and was chosen by WWE COO Triple H to face Cena at SummerSlam for the championship.\nAt Battleground, Rusev defeated Jack Swagger by countout. On the July 22 edition of \"Main Event\", Swagger defeated Rusev by disqualification after Rusev hit Swagger with a Russian flag. On the August 1 edition of \"SmackDown\", after Swagger defeated Cesaro, Lana came out along with Rusev and challenged Swagger to a Flag match at SummerSlam on Rusev's behalf, which Zeb Colter accepted on Swagger's behalf.\nAt Battleground, The Miz won a 19-man battle royal to win the vacated WWE Intercontinental Championship, last eliminating Dolph Ziggler. On the July 21 edition of \"Raw\", Ziggler defeated Miz in a non-title match. On the July 28 edition of \"Raw\", Ziggler and The Usos defeated Miz and RybAxel. On August 4, it was announced on WWE.com that Miz would defend the title against Ziggler at SummerSlam.\nAt Battleground, Seth Rollins defeated Dean Ambrose by forfeit when Ambrose was ejected out of the arena by Triple H for attacking Rollins before the match. On the August 4 edition of \"Raw\", Triple H announced that Ambrose and Rollins would face off at SummerSlam. Triple H also announced that Ambrose and Rollins would face Alberto Del Rio and Rob Van Dam respectively in Beat the Clock challenge matches, and the winner would choose the stipulation for the match at SummerSlam. Ambrose defeated Del Rio to set a time of 15:42. Van Dam was switched out at the last minute for Heath Slater, who defeated Rollins, thus giving Ambrose the right to choose. On the August 8 episode of \"Smackdown\", Ambrose announced that their match at SummerSlam would be a Lumberjack match.\nOn the July 21 edition of \"Raw\", Roman Reigns defeated Kane and Randy Orton in a handicap match and attacked Orton during Triple H's announcement on who would face John Cena at SummerSlam for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On the July 28 edition of \"Raw\", Orton attacked Reigns before his scheduled match against Kane. On the August 1 edition of \"Smackdown\", Orton challenged Reigns to a match at SummerSlam. On August 4, it was announced on WWE.com that Orton would face Reigns at SummerSlam.\nOn August 16, it was announced on WWE.com that Cesaro would face Rob Van Dam on the SummerSlam Kickoff show.\nEvent.\nPre-Show.\nThe SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show match saw Rob Van Dam defeat Cesaro with a Five-Star Frog Splash. An analytical show which was hosted by Renee Young consisted of a pre-show panel that contained Booker T, Alex Riley, and Ric Flair. Hulk Hogan also made an appearance at the event before the main card got underway, promoting the WWE Network to the audience.\nMiscellaneous.\nThe English commentators were Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler, and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, with Spanish and German commentators also at ringside. Lilian Garcia and Justin Roberts were the ring announcers while Tom Phillips conducted backstage interviews.\nUFC's Ronda Rousey, Jessamyn Duke, Marina Shafir, and Shayna Baszler (known as \"The 4 HorseWomen of MMA\") were all present at SummerSlam.\nThe cast of \"Pitch Perfect\" also appeared at the event, quite notably Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, and Brittany Snow, with the latter being seen in a backstage segment with Lana.\nMain card.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with The Miz defending the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Dolph Ziggler. The ending saw Miz executed a Skull Crushing Finale on Ziggler for a near-fall. Ziggler executed a Zig Zag on Miz to win the title.\nNext, AJ Lee defended the WWE Divas Championship against Paige. The match ended when AJ applied the Black Widow on Paige, who countered the Black Widow into a Ram Paige to win the title.\nAfter that, Rusev faced Jack Swagger in a flag match Rusev attempted to attack Swagger before the match but Swagger countered into the Patriot Lock, thus weakening Rusev's ankle. In the end, Swagger passed out to the Accolade, meaning Rusev won by technical submission. Following the match, Rusev assaulted Zeb Colter while he was tending to the fallen Swagger and the National Anthem of Russia was played for Rusev.\nIn the fourth match, Seth Rollins faced Dean Ambrose in a lumberjack match. After both men fought in the arena stands and assaulted the lumberjacks at ringside, Kane came out to try and restore order. Ambrose executed a Curb Stomp on Rollins but Kane interfered and broke up the pinfall, starting a brawl involving all the lumberjacks. Rollins hit a distracted Ambrose with the Money in the Bank briefcase to win the match.\nNext, Chris Jericho faced Bray Wyatt, with Luke Harper and Erick Rowan banned from ringside. Jericho executed a Codebreaker on Wyatt for a near-fall. In the end, Wyatt executed a Sister Abigail into the barricade on Jericho. Wyatt executed another Sister Abigail on Jericho to win the match.\nAfter that, Stephanie McMahon faced Brie Bella. Stephanie dominated the start of the match and countered a suicide-dive attempt by slamming Brie's face into the mat. Stephanie performed a DDT for a near-fall. Brie eventually gained the advantage and performed a missile-dropkick on Stephanie for a near-fall. Following this, Triple H appeared, followed by Nikki Bella. Triple H pulled the referee out of the ring as Brie applied the Yes! Lock, leading to Brie performing a baseball slide on him. Nikki then entered the ring, seemingly to prevent Stephanie from escaping, but instead attacked her sister, turning heel. Stephanie then executed a Pedigree on Brie to win the match.\nIn the penultimate match, Randy Orton faced Roman Reigns. After back-and-forth action, Reigns executed a Superman Punch and attempted a Spear but Orton countered with a Snap Scoop Powerslam for a near-fall. Reigns attempted a Leaping Clothesline but Orton countered with an RKO for a near fall. Orton attempted a Punt Kick but Reigns countered and executed a Spear to win the match.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, John Cena defended his WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman). In the first 30 seconds of the match, Lesnar executed an F-5 on Cena for a near-fall. After, the match was a one-sided beatdown. Lesnar executed 2 German suplexes and a vertical suplex on Cena. Cena in turn managed only brief and ineffective offense. Lesnar executed another 4 German suplexes and then went for the cover on Cena, who kicked out at two. Lesnar once again executed 2 German suplexes on him. As he attempted a third, Cena struck his head with an elbow. As Lesnar attempted a second F-5, Cena countered and executed an Attitude Adjustment for a near-fall. Lesnar then proceeded to sit up (mimicking The Undertaker) and laugh. He executed 7 more German suplexes on Cena, this time not releasing him at some points. Cena applied the STF on Lesnar but Lesnar escaped and executed a second F-5 to win the title.\nReception.\nThe event received positive reviews. The main event match between Lesnar and Cena received 4.25 stars out of five from Dave Meltzer, the best of the event. The Reigns and Orton match received four stars, the Lumberjack Match received 3.75 stars, and the Kickoff match received 3.25 stars.\nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Stephanie McMahon came out to Daniel Bryan's entrance theme to celebrate her victory. She also invited Nikki Bella out to address her betraying Brie Bella. Nikki said she and Brie were supposed to be a team, but that she had felt betrayed by Brie's actions in quitting the company at Payback. Brie came out and confronted Nikki, but Nikki said she would never forgive her and slapped Brie across the face (cementing her heel turn), leaving Brie in tears.\nOn the same event, Seth Rollins fell victim to a surprise Ice Bucket Challenge and beating from Dean Ambrose during an interview segment. Triple H then set up a SummerSlam rematch in order to 'finish off' Ambrose, with the WWE Universe voting on the stipulation; the vote was made for a Falls Count Anywhere match. Ambrose was closing in on a victory when Kane (who had been sitting at ringside) once again interfered and set up Ambrose for Rollins' Curb Stomp through a pile of concrete blocks next to the announce table. Rollins was awarded the victory via knockout and Ambrose was stretchered out of the arena. Ambrose was then reported to have refused treatment and 'gone missing' afterwards. The storyline was put to place to allow Ambrose's absence from television in order to film the movie \"\".\nAlso on \"Raw\", Dolph Ziggler defended his newly won Intercontinental Championship against The Miz. Miz won the match via count-out when Ziggler fell to the floor, thus Ziggler retained the title.\nThe Authority revealed a new belt (subsequently retiring the Big Gold Belt) to represent the WWE World Heavyweight Championship which was presented to Brock Lesnar. On the August 19 edition of \"Main Event\", Triple H announced later that John Cena would invoke his rematch clause at Night of Champions.\nAfter winning back the Divas Championship, Paige and AJ Lee continued their rivalry, with AJ twice distracting Paige and thus causing Paige to lose during matches against Natalya. The Authority made a Triple Threat match, adding Nikki Bella set for Night of Champions. \nOn the August 25 edition of \"Raw\", Cesaro defeated Rob Van Dam in a rematch to become the number one contender for Sheamus' WWE United States Championship. The match was officially confirmed by WWE on August 29 when it was announced that the championship match will take place at Night of Champions. \nAfter defeating Jack Swagger in a Flag match, Rusev was celebrating his victory until he was attacked by Mark Henry. In the ensuing weeks, they would interfere in each other's matches. Henry then challenged Rusev to a match at Night of Champions vowing to be the first to beat Rusev. \nChris Jericho's feud with Bray Wyatt ended on the September 8 edition of \"Raw\", with Wyatt defeating Jericho in a steel cage match.\nAlso on the September 8 edition, Roman Reigns defeated Randy Orton by disqualification in a rematch after Rollins and Kane interfered. The steel cage used in the Wyatt vs. Jericho match was lowered. In the cage, Reigns initially gained the upper hand on Orton before Rollins and Kane were able to get in. Orton hit Reigns with a steel chair that Rollins retrieved under the ring and Rollins performed a curb stomp on Reigns onto the chair."

        "title": "Rowing at the 1932 Summer Olympics – Men's coxed four",
        "text": "The men's coxed four competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles took place at the Long Beach Marine Stadium. It was held from 10 to 13 August. There were 7 boats (35 competitors) from 7 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Germany, the nation's first victory in the event since 1912 and third overall (most among nations and a mark that no other nation achieved before the discontinuance of the event after the 1992 Games). Defending champions Italy came within 0.2 seconds of repeating, with Germany passing them at the very end of the final. Poland won its second consecutive bronze medal.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nFive of the 11 nations from the 1928 Games returned: gold medallists Italy, bronze medallists Poland, fourth-place finishers Germany, seventh-place finishers the United States, and ninth-place finishers Japan. Italy and Switzerland (the silver medallists in 1928) had been the strongest teams in the event for most of the last decade; with Switzerland not having a crew in Los Angeles, Italy was favoured. The Italians had won the European championships five of the last six times, coming in second to Denmark (another nation with no crew competing at the Games) the one remaining time.\nNew Zealand made its debut in the event. Germany and the United States both made their fourth appearance, matching the absent Belgium and France for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nWith fewer boats and a wider course, the competition went from a seven-round tournament in 1928 to only three rounds in 1932. There were two main rounds (semifinals and a final) along with a repechage.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nFirst boat of each heat qualified for the final, remainder go to repechage.\nRepechage.\nFirst two qualify to the final."

And she's definitely got all the goods.\"\nIn the doubles, she once again played with sister Venus as the top seeds. They cruised through their first three matches winning it straight sets, over the teams of Julie Ditty and Renata Voráčová, Timea Bacsinszky and Tathiana Garbin, and Dominika Cibulková and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

        "text": "The British Virgin Islands national cricket team has represented the British overseas territory of the British Virgin Islands in cricket. The team is not a member of the International Cricket Council, but is a member of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from the British Virgin Islands generally represent the Leeward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. The British Virgin Islands have however played as a separate entity in matches which held Twenty20 status, but has not appeared in first-class or List A cricket.\nHistory.\nA British Virgin Islands cricket team first appeared in West Indian cricket in the 1991 Leeward Islands Tournament against the United States Virgin Islands at the Lionel Roberts Stadium, Charlotte Amalie. Prior to that a Combined Virgin Islands team had taken part in the 1988 Leeward Islands Tournament. The following season the team played against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club side and throughout the 1990s it participated in the Leeward Islands One-Day tournament.\nIts participation in that tournament continued until 1998 after which its place was taken by a reconstituted Combined Virgin Islands team before the BVI again started participating separately for the one-day tournaments in 2003 and 2004 while a Combined Virgin Islands team participated in the Leeward Islands 3-day tournament. In February 2002 the islands hosted their only first-class cricket match, when the Leeward Islands played the Windward Islands at the A.O. Shirley Recreation Ground, Roadtown. In 2005 the BVI and USVI again ceased to participate separately in all Leeward Islands tournaments (one day and three-day tournaments) and their places were taken by the Combined Virgin Islands until 2008 after which they participated separately again in all Leeward Islands tournaments.\nAs part of Allen Stanford's vision for cricket in the West Indies, the United States Virgin Islands were invited to take part in the 2006 Stanford 20/20, whose matches held official Twenty20 status. Stanford gave US$100,000 for their participation. They played a single match in the tournament, losing to Saint Lucia by 7 wickets in their preliminary round match. Two years later, they were invited to take part in the 2008 Stanford 20/20, playing a single preliminary round match against Dominica, which they lost by 66 runs.\nFollowing the reorganisation of domestic Twenty20 cricket in the West Indies in the aftermath of the fraud convictions against Allen Stanford, the United States Virgin Islands were excluded from the revamped regional tournament. The team's last recorded appearance in the Leeward Islands One-Day Tournament came against Nevis in 2011."

The tradition began when the league was formed during the 1956–57 season and its history extends to the predecessor Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League, which was formed in 1902. Due to a cheating scandal that involved defending champion Harvard, Princeton was the preseason favorite.\nHarvard won the regular season title outright and earned the conference's only postseason bid. Princeton's Ian Hummer earned the Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year after setting records for most single-season and career Ivy League Player of the Week awards. Harvard tied an Ivy League single-season team record with 13 combined Player of the Week and Rookie of the Week Awards. Ivy League records also fell for career games played by Hummer and career free throw percentage (Brian Barbour).\nIn the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Harvard earned the school's first ever NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament victory and the conference's first NCAA tournament victory in three years.\nPreseason.\nThe Ivy League media selected Princeton as the preseason favorite when 16 of 17 voting members (one voter selected Harvard) named Princeton first in the preseason poll. Jeff Goodman of CBS Sports also selected Princeton as his preseason choice with Harvard second, noting that Harvard had been his preseason favorite until the September 2012 Harvard cheating scandal that involved about 125 athletes and students, including Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry who withdrew from school as a result. Casey and Curry had been first-team and second-team All-Ivy selections for the 2011–12 Ivy League men's basketball season, respectively. Both players withdrew in hopes of preserving their final year of athletic eligibility following the investigation.\nSeason.\nTwelve different television networks scheduled a total of 36 Ivy League men's basketball live broadcasts for the 2012–13 season. This includes a 14-game television package, featuring all eight member institutions, with 13 games being broadcast on the NBC Sports Network and one on the CBS Sports Network. The conference endured two one-day postponements due to the February 2013 nor'easter (also known as Winter Storm Nemo). Harvard's contest against Columbia at Levien Gymnasium in Manhattan that was originally scheduled for February 9 at 7:00 PM was postponed until February 10 at 2:00 PM. Similarly, Dartmouth's game against Cornell originally scheduled to be played at 7:00 PM on February 9 at Newman Arena in Ithaca, New York was postponed until February 10 at 12:00 noon.\nLed by Wesley Saunders' five Ivy League Player of the Week Awards and Siyani Chambers' six Rookie of the Week Awards, Harvard tied the Ivy League team record with thirteen single-season weekly recognitions. Meanwhile, Hummer tied the individual career record with nine player of the week awards and set a new single-season record with seven. Two Ivy League career statistical records fell. Columbia's Brian Barbour completed his career with an 89.7% free throw shooting percentage, surpassing Jim Barton of Dartmouth (class of 1989) who tallied 89.5%. Hummer surpassed former teammate Doug Davis' (class of 2012) 122 career games played with 123 games.\nHonors and accolades.\nColumbia senior guard Brian Barbour was listed among 30 preseason Senior CLASS Award candidates. Cornell's Eitan Chemerinski and Brown's Matthew Sullivan were first team All-District selections from District I placing them among the 40 candidates for the 15-man Academic All-American team.

It was held annually in January at the Queensland Tennis Centre, between 2009 and 2019 before reverting to a WTA only event for 2020 to accommodate the ATP Cup which would be played in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth. The tournament was not seen in 2021 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was dropped entirely from Tennis Australia's schedule for 2023. The Tournament returned to both the ATP and WTA calendars in 2024. \nCanberra International.\nThe Canberra International will form part of the Australian Open Series schedule in 2023. The tournament will be an ATP Challenger 100 event for the men's draw, and an ITF 60 event for the women's draw. The event took on greater status amongst the Australian summer schedule for 2023, whilst returning from a 3 year hiatus due to the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season and then the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2024, the event is an ATP Challenger 125 and a WTA Challenger 125. \nWeek 2.\nAdelaide International.\nThe Adelaide International forms part of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour and Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour. The inaugural tournament was staged in January 2020 and took place at the upgraded Memorial Drive Park facility. In 2022 and 2023 there were two events (\"Adelaide International 1\" and \"Adelaide International 2\") held in consecutive weeks in the lead up to the Australian Open. In 2024, with the return of the Brisbane International in Week 1, the Adelaide International returned to a single tournament in the week leading into the Australian Open. \nHobart International.\nThe Hobart International is a women's professional tennis tournament held at the Hobart International Tennis Centre in Hobart, Australia. Held since 1994, it forms a part of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour and is classed as an International tournament (previously Tier IV). It is competed on outdoor hardcourts, and is held in the run-up to the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, the Australian Open.\nKooyong Classic.\nThe Kooyong Classic is an exhibition tournament played in the lead-up to the Australian Open. The format for the Classic altered in accordance with the number of players participating, though in most years it featured both men's and women's singles matches. Kooyong was the original home of the Australian Open before the tournament moved to Melbourne Park in 1988.\nWeeks 3 and 4.\nAustralian Open.\nThe Australian Open is one of four Grand Slam events on the international tennis schedule. It is held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne in the second half of January. It is the official Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific.\nFormer tournaments.\nATP Cup.\nThe ATP Cup was introduced in 2020 as a representative multi-city tournament where men's players form teams to represent their countries. The ATP Cup was initially supposed to be an annual tournament played across the cities of Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. The initial season in 2020 was played under this format, before the COVID-19 pandemic meant the tournament was staged in Melbourne in 2021 in the immediate lead up to the 2021 Australian Open, before the tournament was staged entirely in Sydney in 2022.\nThe ATP Cup lasted 3 editions before being discontinued after the 2022 edition due to poor attendance and a general lack of popularity amongst fans and players alike. It was replaced by a mixed-sex national team tournament known as the United Cup for 2023.\nHopman Cup.\nThe Hopman Cup was an eight-nation tournament featuring one male and one female player representing their country. The tournament was originally played at the Burswood Dome before being moved to the Perth Arena in 2014. It has featured several of the top players, including Roger Federer, who won the last edition for Switzerland with compatriot Belinda Bencic.\nSydney International.\nThe Sydney International (formerly known as the Championship of New South Wales and New South Wales Open) was played in the lead-up to the Australian Open for both men and women. The tournament was removed from the calendar in 2020 to make way for the ATP Cup. The tournament returned for a one-off edition in 2022, known as the Sydney Tennis Classic.\nWorld Tennis Challenge.\nThe World Tennis Challenge was a three-night exhibition tournament held in the week before the Australian Open in Adelaide, South Australia. The tournament was created by a consortium of past players. It usually had four teams of two players, a 'legend' and a current player were paired into areas e.g. Americas or represent their countries. The current players played each other in a best of 3 match with a match tiebreaker for a 3rd set. The legends played a pro set, and the doubles if needed was a normal set with no a rules before a super tie break.\n2021 and 2022 COVID-19 alternative tournaments.\nIn 2021 most of the usual tournaments were either relocated to Melbourne Park or not held at all, as a result of international and domestic travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 ATP Cup was moved to Melbourne Park but cut to 12 teams, whilst two WTA tournaments (the Gippsland Trophy and Yarra Valley Classic) and two ATP tournaments (the Great Ocean Road Open and Murray River Open) were held at the park in the lead-up to the 2021 Australian Open. An additional WTA tournament, the Grampians Trophy was later added for players who had to undergo strict quarantine measures upon arrival in Australia, serving as preparation for the Australian Open. Two other WTA tournaments, the Phillip Island Trophy and Adelaide International, were staged in the last week and week after the Open. All of the new alternative tournaments except one (sans Adelaide) take place in Melbourne Park but are named after various places in the state of Victoria.\nIn 2022, the series also had an abnormal calendar. Two new tournaments were created in Melbourne Park for the WTA and one new tournament was created for the ATP. The tournaments were named Melbourne Summer Set 1 and Melbourne Summer Set 2. Men did not have a tournament for the Melbourne Summer Set 2."

Even as a young player his goal kicking became well known. In 1914 when he was still in the City 2nd Grade team he was reported thus: \"this boy, Davidson, of City, is said to be a remarkable place kicker and half a dozen goals in one afternoon has been no uncommon achievement for him this season. He kicks them from all angles and all ranges, and many old players and officials have described him as easily the best goal kicker in Auckland\". He made his first grade debut in Round 1 of the 1915 season and scored a try, however because of his age he was deemed still too young (18) for the top side and spent the rest of the year in City's champion second grade team. At the end of the season he was selected in the three quarters for the Junior Auckland side to play Junior Waikato.\nDavidson represented Auckland and scored 5 tries in his debut against Canterbury. He also played in a 1919 defeat of Australia, a 1920 victory over the Great Britain Lions and a 1923 tour of the South Island.\nIn 1919 he was first picked for New Zealand, playing against the touring Australians. He played his second test match in 1920, against Great Britain.\nIn 1922 he played for Auckland against the touring New South Wales team where Auckland lost 40 points to 25. He played against the same team days later for the Auckland Provincial team who also went down by 21 points to 20.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1927 Davidson coached the Buller side in their match against Auckland. Buller were badly outmatched and lost heavily but still managed to score 33 points in the 60-33 result.In 1938 he coached the Ponsonby United team along with fellow ex-New Zealand international Gordon Campbell.\nAdministration career.\nDavidson later served as an administrator in league, swimming and athletics. He represented the City Rovers on the Auckland Rugby League board and also represented the Canterbury Rugby League on the New Zealand Rugby League Board. "

        "text": "\"The Cricket Game\" is the tenth episode of the second season of the American ABC fantasy/drama television series \"Once Upon a Time\", and the show's 32nd episode overall. It aired on January 6, 2013.\nIn this episode Cora frames Regina, while flashbacks show Snow and Charming trying to deal with the Evil Queen.\nIt was co-written by David H. Goodman and Robert Hull, while being directed by Dean White.\nPlot.\nOpening Sequence.\nPongo, Jiminy/Archie's dog, trots around in the forest.\nIn the Characters' Past.\nThe Evil Queen/Regina (Lana Parrilla) surveys a scene of destruction and learns that King George and his army have been defeated by the forces of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), and that Snow is now traveling to reunite with Charming. The Evil Queen orders her soldiers to keep them apart long enough for her to find Snow. Later, she confronts Snow in the forest, and rejects Snow's offer of parley, instead demanding Snow's death. It turns out to be a trap (though the offer of parley was genuine and Snow was prepared to accept the Queen's surrender); the Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) launches an attack on the Queen and magically binds her.\nPrince Charming declares that the only way to deal with the Evil Queen is to put her to death. Snow White recalls that the Queen was once kind and saved her life, but accedes to Charming's insistence that this is the only way to protect the kingdom. The Queen's father, Henry (Tony Perez), visits her in her cell, and blames himself for failing her as a father. He begs her to show remorse in hopes of saving her own life. When she is brought to the site of her execution where a concealed Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) is looking on from the crowd, she expresses regret only for failing to cause more destruction and especially for failing to kill Snow White. Even so, Snow halts the execution at the last moment. She tells Charming that the Queen was only trying to not appear weak as she died and insists that she can be rehabilitated. Rumplestiltskin later reveals himself to Snow and offers his services in testing the Queen to determine if she can truly change.\nSnow White comes to the Evil Queen's cell and tells her she wants them to start fresh. She releases the Queen from the cell and encourages her to leave evil behind when she departs, however, the Queen attacks Snow instead. When Snow tries to defend herself with a dagger, the Queen takes it and stabs Snow. To the Queen's dismay, Snow remains unharmed. Charming emerges and reveals that one of her hairs, taken from the blindfold that was put on her at the execution, was used by Rumplestiltskin to create a protection spell that prevents her from harming Snow or Charming in this land. Snow points out that this was not a trap, but a test she truly hoped the Queen would pass. The Queen is banished forever to live alone with her misery.\nOn Snow White and Prince Charming's wedding day, Rumplestiltskin comes to the Evil Queen and tells her that the protection spell would lose its effect if they traveled to a different land. The Queen calls for a carriage to take her to the wedding.\nIn Storybrooke.\nCora (Barbara Hershey) and Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) moor Hook's ship in Storybrooke. Hook wants them to go their separate ways, but Cora points out that Storybrooke now has magic, and he will be unable to defeat Rumplestiltskin without her help. To hide their presence, Cora makes the ship invisible and turns a harbor worker who has spotted them into a fish.\nMary Margaret (Goodwin) and David (Dallas) enjoy their first physical intimacy they have enjoyed in 28 years, before being interrupted by Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore). Later, they attend a “welcome home” party for Mary Margaret and Emma at Granny's (Beverley Elliott). At Emma's invitation, Regina also attends. Emma persuades Mary Margaret and David to accept Regina's presence, but Regina does not feel comfortable and leaves early. She and Emma fight about her desire to spend more time with Henry, but Regina ultimately apologizes and they are able to be civil. Emma mentions that Dr. Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge) reassured her about Regina's efforts to change. As Regina leaves, Cora and Hook observe her from a rooftop and Cora says that Regina is not yet broken.\nThe next day, Regina confronts Dr. Hopper about discussing her sessions with Emma, but he insists he did not breach physician–patient privilege and encourages her to still see him as a confidante. Ruby (Meghan Ory) observes their argument. That night, Regina comes to Dr. Hopper's office and asks if they can talk, but then she attacks him. Ruby sees her come and go, but only the audience learns that “Regina” is actually Cora in a magical guise.\nThe following day, as Henry leaves for school, Archie's dog, Pongo, comes up to Emma and barks repeatedly. Ruby determines that something is wrong, and she and Emma follow the dog back to Archie's office and find him dead on the floor. On the strength of what Ruby has witnessed, Regina is brought in for questioning and claims she had nothing to do with the murder. To Mary Margaret and David's surprise, Emma believes her and lets her go. The three of them search Dr. Hopper's office for clues and find that Regina's file is missing; Emma explains that the large amount of evidence is suspicious in and of itself and actually points towards a frame job. They realize that Mr. Gold (Carlyle) is the likeliest perpetrator, and they confront him. He denies any involvement, and uses a dreamcatcher to extract Pongo's memories. With Gold's encouragement, Emma then uses her own magic to display the dog's memory of Archie's murder, and they all witness Regina seemingly choking the therapist to death.\nEmma is now ready to arrest Regina, but Mary Margaret and David point out that they need a plan. When they go to Regina's house and tell her what they have seen, she demands the opportunity to tell Henry her side of the story. At Emma's command, the Mother Superior appears with fairy dust refined by the dwarves, but Regina is able to deflect the attack and magically throw Emma to the ground. When Emma confronts Regina with the fact that Henry will never again believe her and that she will never change, she magically flees. As they wait for Henry's school bus, Emma, Mary Margaret, and David discuss the fact that they are all struggling to learn how to be parents to children they barely know and resolve to face their challenges together as a family. After the bus arrives, Emma takes Henry aside to tell him what has happened, while a weeping Regina looks on from a distance.\nOn Hook's ship, Cora reveals to Hook that Archie is now a prisoner in the hold and that the corpse in his office was the body of someone else Cora murdered and then magically disguised as him. Cora's plan is to use Archie's knowledge of the deepest secrets of Storybrooke's residents in order to discover and exploit Rumplestiltskin's weaknesses.\nProduction.\n\"The Cricket Game\" was co-written by producer Robert Hull and co-executive producer David H. Goodman, while being directed by \"V\" alum Dean White.\nReception.\nRatings.\nThis outing held steady from the previous episode, scoring a 3.1/8 among 18-49s with 9.1 million viewers tuning in.\nReviews.\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" critic Hilary Busis gave it a good review: \"\"Once Upon a Time\" tackled these questions and more tonight, returning from its hiatus with a winter premiere heavy on setup and light on payoff -- just what we should have expected from an hour meant to kick-start the season's second half. Still, any episode that features Regina suggesting that Red take herself for a walk is A-Okay in my book.\"\nOliver Sava of \"The A.V. Club\" gave it a B: \"Once Upon A Time flew off the rails during the first half of this season, but its first episode back from winter hiatus makes some promising strides in the right direction. As Emma and Snow White are getting accustomed to life back in Storybrooke, a tragic crime throws them back in the drama, but writers David H. Goodman and Robert Hull are setting up a new plot without backtracking any progress made with the characters.\"\nAmy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode an 8.5, proclaiming that \"\"Once Upon a Time\" demonstrates how not to be a parent in this week's wrenching episode.\" She also added that \"Parrilla does a masterful job at playing all the sides of Regina\" and that it was \"cool to see Emma intentionally using magic for the first time.\""

        "text": "Nikola Milojević (, ; born 19 June 1995) is a Serbian professional tennis player.\nMilojević has a career high ATP singles ranking of No. 125, which he achieved on 21 February 2022. He also achieved a career high ATP doubles ranking of No. 252 on 18 February 2019. He reached his highest ranking of no. 1 in ITF Junior rankings on 7 January 2013.\nCareer.\nJunior career (2008–13).\nAs a junior, Milojević was a prodigious player who won several youth tournaments. He won his first title, the U14 Jug Open, on 25 May 2008, when he was still one month short of his 13th birthday. Between July and November 2008, Milojević reached five U14 finals in a row, winning three and losing two.\nIn 2009, Milojević dominated the U14 circuit in the Tennis Europe Junior Tour, starting off the season by winning a national title at the indoor championship held in Novi Sad, which was followed by a Category 1 title in Bolton. He then collected two of the most prestigious trophies of the year at Petits As and the European Junior Championships at Pilsen, beating Borna Ćorić and Kyle Edmund, respectively, in the finals. He also won titles in Maia (Portugal) and Livorno (Italy). He remained undefeated in his age group (Under 14), both on the domestic and world stage, until six months after his debut in the U14 circuit.\nBefore he turned 14, Milojević started competing in the ITF Junior Circuit in the under-18 category. In his first three tournaments, he reached the quarterfinals in all of them, including a semifinal in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in November 2009.\nIn 2012, Milojević won five ITF titles across all four surfaces, winning in Malaysia and Manila on hardcourts, in Halle on grass, Nagoya on carpet, and in Mexico City on clay. He then kickstarted 2013 by winning the Copa del Cafe in Costa Rica, beating Tommy Mylnikov in the final. This triumph allowed him to become the world's No. 1 in the ITF Junior rankings, thus becoming the first Serbian to reach such a feat since Janko Tipsarević.\n2014: ATP debut.\nMilojević was a fifth player on a Serbian Davis Cup team in the first round tie against United States in the 2010 Davis Cup as well as a first round tie against Switzerland in 2014 and didn't play in any match.\nMilojević made his ATP main draw debut as a wildcard at 2014 Düsseldorf Open, where he defeated Mirza Bašić in the first round before losing to eventual finalist, Ivo Karlović, in the second round.\n2017: Three Challengers finals, Top 150 debut.\nHe was also invited for a semifinal clash against France in 2017, but instead chose to play in a Challenger tournament in order to improve his ATP ranking. He reached the top 150 on 2 October 2017.\n2018–19: Davis Cup debut, First &amp; Second Challenger titles.\nIn February 2018, he finally made his Davis Cup debut, partnered with another debutant, Miljan Zekić, in a doubles match against the US, losing 7–6(3), 2–6, 5–7, 4–6 in the first round.\nIn June 2018, Milojević won his first Challenger title in Fergana, Uzbekistan.\nMilojević partnered with Danilo Petrović for the 2018 Davis Cup World Group play-offs vs. India in September. They defeated Rohan Bopanna/Saketh Myneni in straight sets to help secure Serbia a decisive 3–0 lead after second day's play. (Serbia eventually won the tie 4–0)\nIn August 2019, he won his third Challenger title at the 2019 Svijany Open in Liberec, Czechia.\n2020–21: ATP Cup champion &amp; Major debut &amp; first win, Challenger Third title &amp; two finals.\nIn January 2020, he was part of Serbian team that won the Inaugural ATP Cup by defeating Spain in the final.\nIn September 2020, Milojević reached the second round on his debut as a qualifier in a Grand Slam main draw at the 2020 French Open, where he won his first match against fellow Serbian Filip Krajinović in four sets 6–4, 3–6, 6–3, 6–1.\nAfter winning his third Challenger title at the 2021 Zadar Open in Croatia by defeating Bulgarian Dimitar Kuzmanov, Milojević reached his best career-high ranking of No. 129 on 5 April 2021.\n2022: Australian Open debut, ATP quarterfinal and Top 125 debut.\nIn January, Milojević qualified into the main draw of the 2022 Australian Open for the first time at this Major, but lost to Mackenzie McDonald in the opening round. After the Australian tour, he reached the quarterfinals as a lucky loser at the Córdoba Open where he lost to Juan Ignacio Londero.

        "text": "The 2010 Novak Djokovic tennis season officially commenced on January 4 with the start of the 2010 ATP World Tour.\nYearly summary.\nGrand Slam performances.\nAustralian Open.\nDjokovic eased through the initial four rounds of the first Grand Slam of the year, dropping just one set to Marco Chiudinelli. In a repeat of the 2008 final, Djokovic faced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter-finals. Tsonga \"gained revenge with an absorbing – albeit error-strewn – victory against the third seed in a match lasting almost four hours.\" Djokovic had convincingly won the third set 6–1 but soon after left the court having told the umpire that he was about to vomit. After the medical time out, Djokovic returned to the court but \"quickly found himself 5–0 down and never really recovered.\" Tsonga eventually progressed by way of a 7–6(8–6) 6–7(5–7) 1–6 6–3 6–1 victory. Despite the loss, Djokovic attained a career-high ranking of world no. 2.\nRoland Garros.\nDjokovic entered the French Open seeded third. He defeated Evgeny Korolev, Kei Nishikori, Victor Hănescu, and Robby Ginepri en route to the quarter-finals; his opponent there was Jürgen Melzer. No. 22 seed Melzer overcame Djokovic in 4 hours and 15 minutes with Djokovic having had a two sets to love advantage. Despite suffering from hayfever-like symptoms, Djokovic managed to save two match points before eventually relinquishing the match. It was the first time Melzer reached the last four of a Grand Slam event.\nWimbledon.\nAgain seeded third, Djokovic defeated Olivier Rochus, Taylor Dent and Albert Montañés to set up a fourth round encounter with former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt. Djokovic eventually progressed to his second Wimbledon semi-final against Tomáš Berdych, the Czech having upset Roger Federer in the previous round. \"Djokovic had won both the previous matches between the two and as the world no. 3 was the higher-ranked player, far more experienced at this level, having played in six previous semi-finals.\" Nevertheless, Berdych overcame Djokovic in straight sets, setting up a final with Rafael Nadal.\nUS Open.\nDjokovic came very close to losing in his opening round against Viktor Troicki in extreme heat. He then defeated Philipp Petzschner, James Blake and Mardy Fish, and number 17 seed Gaël Monfils, all in straight sets to reach the US Open semifinals for the fourth consecutive year. In the semifinals, Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in five sets after saving 2 match points with forehand winners while serving to stay in the match at 4–5 in the 5th set. It was Djokovic's first victory over Federer at the US Open in four attempts and his first victory over Federer in a Major since the 2008 Australian Open. Djokovic lost to Nadal in the final, a match that saw Nadal complete his career Grand Slam.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Djokovic in 2010, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins. They are marked ND for non-decision or no decision.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nNovak Djokovic had a record against the top 10, a against the top 50 and a against players outside the top 50.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\"\nEarnings.\nNovak Djokovic earned $4.3 million throughout the season."

        "title": "2014 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2014 proceeded according to rules most recently revised in July 2010. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 8, 2014. The Expansion Era Committee, one of three voting panels that replaced the more broadly defined Veterans Committee following the July 2010 rules change, convened early in December 2013 to select from a ballot of retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport after 1972, a time frame that the Hall of Fame calls the \"Expansion Era\".\nThe induction class consisted of managers Bobby Cox, Tony La Russa, and Joe Torre, elected by the Expansion Era Committee, and Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Frank Thomas, elected by the BBWAA.\nThe induction ceremonies were held on July 27, 2014, at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. On the day before the actual induction ceremony, the annual Hall of Fame Awards Presentation took place. At that event, the Hall presented two awards for media excellence—its own Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink Award for writers. In addition, the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award was also handed out; under the rules for that award, last presented in 2011, it may be presented no more frequently than every third year.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA ballot was announced on November 26, 2013. The BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1994 or later, but not after 2008; the ballot included the following categories of players:\nAll 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote, and had until December 31, 2013, to return their ballots to the Hall.\nThe ballot consisted of 17 of the 18 candidates who received at least 5% of the vote in the 2013 election, plus 19 first-time candidates. (The other candidate who received 5% or more of the 2013 vote, Dale Murphy, dropped off the ballot after 15 years.) Voters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates. Under BBWAA rules, write-in votes were not permitted.\nResults of the 2013 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 8, 2014. A total of 571 ballots were cast (including one ballot which supported no candidates), with 429 votes required for election. A total of 4,793 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.39 per ballot—the highest per-ballot average since 1960 (8.51 votes per ballot), the first per-ballot average of 8 or higher since 1983 (8.36), and the first per-ballot average of even 7 or higher since 1986 (7.04). According to former BBWAA president Bill Shaiklin, 50% of all voters filled out all 10 available slots on their ballots, up from 22% in 2013. Any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be inducted. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated with a dagger (†). The candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates selected in subsequent elections, if any, will be indicated in \"italics\".\nJack Morris was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly eligible candidates included 28 All-Stars, 12 of whom were not on the ballot, representing a total of 83 All-Star selections. Among the candidates were 10-time All-Star and 2-time Cy Young Award winner Tom Glavine, 8-time All-Star and 4-time Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux, 6-time All-Star Moisés Alou, 5-time All-Star and 2-time MVP Award winner Frank Thomas, 5-time All-Star and 1-time MVP Award winner Jeff Kent, and 5-time All-Stars Luis Gonzalez. The field included 1995 NL Rookie of the Year Hideo Nomo, two MVPs (Kent and Thomas), three Cy Young Award winners (Glavine, Maddux and Éric Gagné). The field included four candidates with at least five Gold Glove Awards: Maddux (18 at pitcher, a record), Mussina (7 at pitcher), Kenny Rogers (5 at pitcher) and J. T. Snow (6 at first base).\nAs in most recent elections, it was expected that the controversy over use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) was likely to dominate the elections. \"ESPN.com\" columnist Jim Caple noted in the days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue and the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot was likely to result in a major backlog in upcoming elections:Due to the steroid issue and a general lack of consensus, the following players will probably be on the ballot in three years: Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson, Sammy Sosa, Jeff Bagwell, John Smoltz, Edgar Martinez, Mark McGwire, Mike Mussina, Jeff Kent, Larry Walker, Alan Trammell, Fred McGriff, Rafael Palmeiro, Lee Smith, Tim Raines, Gary Sheffield, Mike Piazza, Curt Schilling and, of course, Bernie [Williams]. That's 21 players who warrant serious consideration. And that's not counting Barry Larkin, who might be [\"Ed.\" – and was] elected this year, and also assuming Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Craig Biggio and Frank Thomas make it their first years on the ballot. Finding room for Bonds, Clemens, Pedro, Johnson and others means I'll have to dump more good players from my ballot than the Marlins dumped after winning the 1997 World Series.\nSeveral other players returning from the 2013 ballot with otherwise-strong Hall credentials have been linked to PEDs, among them Mark McGwire (who admitted to long-term steroid use in 2010), Jeff Bagwell (who never tested positive, but was the subject of PED rumors during his career), and Rafael Palmeiro (who tested positive for stanozolol shortly after denying that he had ever used steroids).\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Tony Armas Jr., Gary Bennett, Joe Borowski, Jose Cruz Jr., Mike DiFelice, Damion Easley, Scott Elarton, Shawn Estes, Sal Fasano, Keith Foulke, Scott Hatteberg, Geoff Jenkins, Jason Johnson, Ray King, Jon Lieber, Esteban Loaiza, Kent Mercker, Matt Morris, Trot Nixon, Abraham Nunez, Odalis Perez, Tomas Perez, Mark Redman, Alberto Reyes, Ricardo Rincon, Dave Roberts, Rudy Seanez, Shannon Stewart, Tanyon Sturtze, Mark Sweeney, Salomon Torres, Steve Trachsel, Javier Valentin, Jose Vidro, Daryle Ward, and Dmitri Young.\nControversies.\nFollowing the vote, a number of writers expressed concern about what they viewed as a flawed election process.\nJayson Stark of \"ESPN.com\" noted about this election,It wasn't exactly a perfect day for any of us who care about this process, because it sledgehammered home this painful reminder of the enduring Hall of Fame crisis of the 21st century: We still have no idea how to resolve the fate of many of the greatest players of all time. Now do we?...Is this what we want -- a Hall that attempts to pretend that players who just happen to hold some of the greatest records in the entire record book are now invisible to the naked eye?\nJonah Keri, writing for the ESPN outlet Grantland, remarked,Short of dropping the required share of the vote well below 75 percent, I think there's a good chance that the voters' failure to elect candidates who not only match but raise the bar on existing inductees has put us in an intractable position. That position will leave many obviously worthy players at the mercy of the Expansion Era Committee, or whatever the veterans committees will be called 10 or 12 years from now. And not to be overly dramatic about it, but there's a reasonable chance that some of those players will either never make it in or be dead by the time they do, the way Ron Santo was when he got his long-overdue induction.\nIt was also revealed that voter Dan Le Batard had allowed Deadspin to use his vote. The website was protesting the \"absurd election process\" by submitting to BBWAA the results from a poll of its readers. He was subsequently permanently stripped of his Hall of Fame voting privileges.\nExpansion Era Committee.\nIn keeping with the current voting procedure by eras, the BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee, made up of 11 BBWAA members, identified 12 Expansion Era candidates who were judged to have made their greatest contributions after 1972; this group was previously considered in 2011. Although several managers and executives and one umpire from this period were selected between 1993 and 2011, no player from this period has yet been elected by any of the forms of the Veterans Committee. Along with the post-1972 era, these criteria defined the consideration set:\nThe eleven BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee members were Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"); Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"); Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"); Bill Madden (\"New York Daily News\"); Ken Nigro (formerly \"The Baltimore Sun\"); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Tracy Ringolsby (Fox Sports Rocky Mountain/MLB.com); Glenn Schwarz (formerly \"San Francisco Chronicle\"); Claire Smith (ESPN); and Mark Whicker (\"Orange County Register\").\nThe ballot for election by the Expansion Era Committee was released on November 4, 2013, and the Hall of Fame announced the results on December 9. The cutoff for election and summer 2014 induction remains the standard 75%, or 12 of 16 votes.\nDave Concepcion, Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Billy Martin, Marvin Miller, Dave Parker, Dan Quisneberry, Ted Simmons and George Steinbrenner each received six or fewer votes.\nThe Expansion Era Committee's 16-member voting electorate, appointed by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors, was announced at the same time as the ballot of 12 candidates. The Hall officially calls this group the \"Expansion Era Committee\", but media still generally refer to it as the \"Veterans Committee\".\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were not named on the ballot include Bob Boone, Bill Buckner, Dwight Evans, Keith Hernandez, Fred Lynn, Dale Murphy, Willie Randolph and Frank White. Other first-time eligibles who did not appear on the ballot include manager Lou Piniella and umpire Ed Montague.\nFollowing the election, ESPN columnist Rick Reilly accused the committee members of hypocrisy, believing they did not follow the same standard for managers who had alleged or confirmed PED users on their teams as many BBWAA members used in refusing to vote for the same players. Reilly was especially critical of La Russa's election, claiming he \"did more for juicers than Jack LaLanne\", and added (emphasis in original):In all, the three managers being inducted oversaw at least 34 players who've been implicated as PED users and never noticed a thing wrong. You could build a wing with the admitted and suspected drug cheats they won with: A-Rod, Roger Clemens (Torre), Jason Giambi, Jose Canseco (Torre and La Russa), Mark McGwire (La Russa), Melky Cabrera (Torre and Cox), David Justice (Torre and Cox), Andy Pettitte (Torre), Manny Ramirez (Torre with the Dodgers) and [Gary] Sheffield (Torre and Cox). If we get really lucky, maybe disgraced HGH pitcher Darren Holmes will show up. He played under all three of them! It's just another year in the Hall of Farce, where the codes of conduct shift like beach sand; where the rules for one set of men are ignored for another; where PED poppers can \"never\" enter, but the men who turned their backs to the cheating get gleaming, bronze plaques. . . . But for the expansion error committee to let these three managers in — unanimously, no less — after winning hundreds of games with better chemistry is the gold standard of double standards.\nIn July 2016, the Hall announced major changes to its era-based committees, replacing the then-current three voting bodies with four new committees. The era covered by the Expansion Era Committee will now be served by two new panels—the Modern Baseball and Today's Game Committees, respectively covering the 1970–1987 and post-1987 eras. Each new committee will meet twice in a 5-year cycle.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three nominees for the 2014 award, selected by a BBWAA committee, were announced at the BBWAA's annual All-Star Game meeting on July 16, 2013. They were Roger Angell, longtime essayist for \"The New Yorker\"; the late Furman Bisher, longtime columnist for the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\"; and Mel Durslag, former columnist for the \"Los Angeles Herald Examiner\". Under BBWAA rules, the winner was to be announced either during the 2013 World Series or at the 2013 winter meetings; in recent years, the announcement has been made at the winter meetings.\nOn December 10, the Hall announced Angell as the recipient. He received 258 votes from a total of 451 ballots, including four blanks. Bisher received 115 votes and Durslag 74. Angell, who was 93 at the time of announcement, is the first Spink Award recipient to have never been a member of the BBWAA; according to the Hall, the group \"limits its membership to writers covering Major League Baseball for daily newspapers, wire services and some Internet outlets.\" However, the award is not restricted to BBWAA members, and Angell was nominated by the group's San Francisco Bay Area chapter. Angell has written about baseball for \"The New Yorker\" for over 50 years, and many of his essays for the magazine have been reprinted in several best-selling books spanning four decades.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies since 1978. Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans. The recipient was announced during the 2013 winter meetings on December 11, following a vote by a 20-member committee composed of the living recipients along with broadcasting historians and columnists.\nBeginning with this year's election, the selection process underwent major changes similar to those instituted for Veterans Committee balloting in 2010. Candidates are now considered every third year, based on the era in which they made their most significant contributions:\nAlso, the committee that selects the final recipient no longer has a role in determining any of the finalists. In previous years, the selection committee also chose seven of the 10 finalists, but that role has now been given to a Hall of Fame research committee.\nTen finalists from the \"High Tide Era\" were announced on October 2, 2013. In accord with the new guidelines, seven were chosen by a Hall of Fame research committee. Three were selected from a list of candidates by fan voting at the Hall's Facebook page from September 9 to September 30.\nAll finalists except King were living when the ballot was announced; the only living finalist who was not active was Van Wieren (who would die six days after the induction ceremony).\nOn December 11, Nadel was announced as the recipient. He has been a radio broadcaster for the Texas Rangers since 1979. and has been the team's lead radio voice since 1985. Nadel became the first broadcaster associated primarily with the Rangers to receive the award.\nBuck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award.\nAnother Hall of Fame honor, the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, was also presented at the 2014 Awards Presentation. The award was created in 2008 in honor of Buck O'Neil, a Negro leagues star who went on to become one of baseball's leading ambassadors until his death in 2006. The first award was presented posthumously to O'Neil at the 2008 induction ceremony, and the second was given to veteran baseball executive Roland Hemond in 2011. According to the Hall,The Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award is presented by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors not more than once every three years to honor an individual whose extraordinary efforts enhanced baseball's positive impact on society, broadened the game's appeal, and whose character, integrity and dignity are comparable to the qualities exhibited by O'Neil.\nAs with the media awards, recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized by the Hall. In this case, the recipients are listed alongside a life-size statue of O'Neil that stands at the entrance to the museum. Written nominations for the award are accepted by mail at any time; the nomination must specifically state how the nominee meets the traits exemplified by O'Neil.\nOn December 4, 2013, the Hall announced that Joe Garagiola would be the 2014 recipient. Garagiola, a former player and broadcaster who received the Frick Award in 1991, is a founder of two organizations that, according to the Hall, \"impact baseball in a positive manner\"—the Baseball Assistance Team, which has distributed over $28 million in grants to needy members of the professional baseball community since the organization's formation in 1986, and the National Spit Tobacco Education Program, devoted to education on the dangers of smokeless tobacco."

        "text": "The 2013 Women's Six Nations Championship, also known as the 2013 RBS Women's Six Nations, due to the tournament been sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland, was the 12th series of the annual women's rugby union competition. Matches were held in February and March 2013, on the same weekends as the men's tournament.\n won their first championship, winning both a Triple Crown and a Grand Slam at the same time. In their opening match of the campaign, Ireland beat 12–10. Then on 9 February 2013 they defeated for the first time. Alison Miller scored a hat-trick of tries as Ireland won 25–0. On 23 February 2013 they clinched their first Triple Crown with a 30–3 win against Scotland.\nOn 8 March 2013 Ireland effectively won the championship after they defeated France 15–10. It was confirmed the following day after failed to defeat England. Ireland eventually finished four points clear of runners-up France. Ireland secured the Grand Slam with a 6–3 away win against Italy on Saint Patrick's Day. Two penalties from Niamh Briggs gave Ireland their fifth win in a row.\nItaly's defence was one of the revelations of the tournament - aside from the first half against England. This was by far and away their best ever Six Nations. Injuries to key players at the start of the tournament hampered France's challenge, but they were in magnificent form at home, won for the first time at Twickenham, and lost only narrowly in Italy and Ireland. Wales would also have been broadly content with their performance, with narrow defeats to Ireland and England - but wins over Italy and Scotland ensured World Cup qualification, which was their main aim. Scotland, on the other hand, suffered some horrendous defeats in a very disappointing campaign where they scored no tries and only three points. As for England, like 2009, the vast majority of their leading players were left out of the Six Nations squad to prepare for the forthcoming Sevens World Cup taking place in June in Russia, so they used the Sevens World Series as a warm-up for that event. Consequently, they had a largely inexperienced squad with only 3 players remaining from the successful series win over New Zealand in the Autumn of 2012.\nFixtures and results.\nWeek 1.\nAssistant referees:\nBarbara Guastini (Italy)\nMonia Salvini (Italy)\nAssessor:\nValeria Ballardini (Italy)\nAssistant referees:\nSarah Cox (England)\nSimon Bourne (England)\nAssessor:\nDavid Warren (England)\nAssistant referees:\nKelvin Shorte (Wales)\nPeter Evans (Wales)\nAssessor:\nVernon Brown (Wales)\nWeek 2.\nAssistant referees:\nn/a\nn/a\nAssessor:\nn/a\nAssistant referees:\nHelen O'Reilly (Ireland)\nEdward Kenny (Ireland)\nAssessor:\nMichael Carroll (Ireland)\nAssistant referees:\nn/a\nn/a\nAssessor:\nn/a\nWeek 3.\nAssistant referees:\nAlex Pratt (Scotland)\nBrian Darling (Scotland)\nAssessor:\nn/a\nAssistant referees:\nClare Daniels (England)\nMichael Patz (England)\nAssessor:\nKeith Page (England)\nAssistant referees:\nFederica Guerzoni (Italy)\nBeatrice Benvenuti (Italy)\nAssessor:\nn/a\nWeek 4.\nAssistant referees:\nKen Henley-Willis (Ireland)\nGary Glennon (Ireland)\nAssessor:\nTim Aplin (Ireland)\nAssistant referees:\nMichael Cooper (England)\nNikki O'Donnell (England)\nAssessor:\nSteve Riley (England)\nAssistant referees:\nMhairi Hay (Scotland)\nAlex Pratt (Scotland)\nAssessor:\nAndy Clift (Scotland)\nWeek 5.\nAssistant referees:\nn/a\nn/a\nAssessor:\nn/a\nAssistant referees:\nBarbara Guastini (Italy)\nDoranna De Carlini (Italy)\nAssessor:\nValeria Ballardini (Italy)\nAssistant referees:\nSimon Rees (Wales)\nAlan Jenkins (Wales)\nAssessor:\nn/a\nLeading Scorers.\nIndividual Ranking:\nTries:\nPenalties &amp; Conversions:\nOverall Individual Points"

        "title": "United States Virgin Islands national cricket team",
        "text": "The United States Virgin Islands cricket team has represented the United States unincorporated territory of the United States Virgin Islands in cricket. The team is not a member of the International Cricket Council, but is a member of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from the United States Virgin Islands generally represent the Leeward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. The United States Virgin Islands have however played as a separate entity in matches which held Twenty20 status, but has not appeared in first-class or List A cricket.\nHistory.\nA United States Virgin Islands cricket team first appeared in West Indian cricket in the 1991 Leeward Islands Tournament against the British Virgin Islands at the Lionel Roberts Stadium, Charlotte Amalie. Prior to that a Combined Virgin Islands team had taken part in the 1988 Leeward Islands Tournament. The following season the team played against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club side and throughout the 1990s it participated in the Leeward Islands One-Day tournament.\nIts participation in that tournament continued until 1998 after which its place was taken by a reconstituted Combined Virgin Islands team before the USVI again started participating separately for the one-day tournaments in 2003 and 2004 while a Combined Virgin Islands team participated in the Leeward Islands 3-day tournament. It was in February 2003 that the islands first hosted first-class cricket, with West Indies B playing Guyana at the Paul E. Joseph Stadium, Frederiksted. In March of that same year, the Leeward Islands played their first-class cricket on the islands for the first time when they played Trinidad and Tobago in the 2002/03 Carib Beer Cup, with the ground having held five further first-class matches since. In 2005 the USVI and BVI again ceased to participate separately in all Leeward Islands tournaments (one day and three-day tournaments) and their places were taken by the Combined Virgin Islands until 2008 after which they participated separately again in all Leeward Islands tournaments.\nAs part of Allen Stanford's vision for cricket in the West Indies, the United States Virgin Islands were invited to take part in the 2006 Stanford 20/20, whose matches held official Twenty20 status. Stanford gave US$100,000 for their participation. They played two matches in the tournament, defeating Sint Maarten by 47 runs in their preliminary round match, before losing in the first round to St Vincent and the Grenadines by 5 wickets. Two years later, they were invited to take part in the 2008 Stanford 20/20, where the team was trained by Desmond Haynes and coached by former Leeward Islands cricketer Livingston Harris. They won their preliminary round match against St Kitts by 4 wickets, before losing in the first round to Antigua and Barbuda by 24 runs.\nFollowing the reorganisation of domestic Twenty20 cricket in the West Indies in the aftermath of the fraud convictions against Allen Stanford, the United States Virgin Islands were excluded from the revamped regional tournament. The team's last appearance in the Leeward Islands One-Day Tournament came against Montserrat in 2009."

        "title": "James Young (basketball)",
        "text": "James Young (born August 16, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for Treviso Basket of the Lega Basket Serie A. He played one season of college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats before being selected with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. He spent the majority of his rookie NBA season playing in the NBA Development League for the Celtics' affiliate team, the Maine Red Claws. In 2019-20 he was the top scorer in the Israel Basketball Premier League, with an average of 20.5 points per game.\nHigh school career.\nYoung attended both Troy High School in Troy, Michigan, and Rochester High School in Rochester Hills, Michigan. As a junior at Troy in 2011–12, Young averaged 25.1 points, 10.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.5 steals per game, earning first-team All-State honors from the Associated Press, Detroit News and Detroit Free Press.\nOn October 11, 2012, Young signed a letter of intent to play college basketball for the University of Kentucky. As a senior at Rochester in 2012–13, Young averaged 27.2 points, 16.0 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game, going on to earn McDonald's All-American honors.\nConsidered a five-star recruit by ESPN.com, Young was listed as the No. 3 small forward and the No. 8 player in the nation in 2013.\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman at Kentucky in 2013–14, Young finished second in UK single-season freshman history with 82 made three-pointers on the season. He was named SEC Freshman of the Week two times, earned second-team All-SEC honors, SEC All-Freshman team honors, and was named to the Final Four NCAA All-Tournament team. In 40 games (39 starts), he averaged 14.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 32.4 minutes per game. Early in the season, on November 19, he scored a career-high 26 points and hit five three-pointers in a 105–76 win over UT Arlington.\nOn April 17, 2014, Young declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Celtics (2014–2017).\n2014–15 season.\nOn June 26, 2014, Young was selected with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. On July 10, 2014, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Celtics. Injuries forced Young to miss the summer league, most of training camp and part of the early season. Because of these setbacks, Young spent much of the season driving back and forth between Boston and Maine, playing for the Red Claws in order to receive consistent playing time. He had 11 D-League assignments in total during his rookie season. Playing in the D-League was something Young was originally against, but grew to love in time, even urging the Celtics to send him to Maine during the month of December. Young finally got an opportunity to shine for the Celtics on January 5, 2015, scoring a season-high 13 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. In light of this performance, Young had a solid run of playing time in Brad Stevens' rotation, averaging 3.8 points in 12.9 minutes per game between January 5 and March 6. However, following that string of opportunities, Young managed just four more appearances to close out the regular season, and failed to appear in any of the Celtics' four playoff games against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nIn 19 games for the Red Claws in 2014–15, Young averaged 20.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.4 steals per game.\n2015–16 season.\nIn July 2015, Young joined the Celtics for the 2015 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 9.4 points and 3.4 rebounds in five games. His performance was considered underwhelming, as he shot just 27.1% from the field and 22.7% from three-point range. He subsequently played the fewest preseason minutes of anyone who made the final 2015–16 opening night roster. Despite this, on October 30, the Celtics exercised their third-year team option on Young's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season. His early 2015–16 season opportunities mirrored his rookie season, as he spent five days with the Red Claws between November 3 and 9 on two different assignments before finally making his season debut for the Celtics on November 10, playing in the final 49 seconds of the team's 99–83 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. He received three more assignments to Maine following this. After playing in three games for the Celtics between November 24 and December 3, he almost got on a plane from San Antonio to Maine on December 4, but was informed not to minutes before boarding; the Celtics needed Young as insurance because of a quad injury to Avery Bradley. Young ultimately did not play for the Celtics against the Spurs on December 5. He went on to appear in seven of the team's next eight games, averaging 14.3 minutes per game over that stretch. Young received seven more assignments to the Red Claws in 2016 and appeared in three of the Celtics' six playoff games against the Atlanta Hawks.\nIn 16 games for the Red Claws in 2015–16, Young averaged 14.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.0 steals per game.\n2016–17 season.\nIn July 2016, Young re-joined the Celtics for the 2016 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 7.5 points and 2.8 rebounds in six games. On October 24, 2016, Young was retained by the Celtics for the 2016–17 season. On November 12, 2016, in the Celtics' ninth game of the season, Young scored a season-high 12 points in a 105–99 win over the Indiana Pacers. Young went unassigned in 2016–17 but only managed 29 games during the regular season.\n2017 off-season.\nIn July 2017, Young became a free agent and joined the New Orleans Pelicans for the 2017 NBA Summer League. On September 6, 2017, he signed a training camp contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. He was waived by the Bucks on October 5, 2017.\nWisconsin Herd (2017–2018).\nOn October 22, 2017, Young was named in the inaugural Wisconsin Herd training camp roster. He went on to earn a spot in the team's opening-night roster.\nPhiladelphia 76ers (2018).\nOn January 5, 2018, Young was signed to a two-way contract by the Philadelphia 76ers. Under the terms of the deal, Young split his playing time for the year between the 76ers and their G League affiliate, the Delaware 87ers. On March 26, 2018, Young was waived by the 76ers.\nSecond stint with Wisconsin Herd (2018–2019).\nIn October 2018, Young re-joined the Wisconsin Herd. On January 18, 2019, he was waived by the Herd.\nMaccabi Haifa (2019–2020).\nOn August 8, 2019, Young signed a one-year deal with Maccabi Haifa of the Israeli Premier League. On November 14, 2019, Young recorded a career-high 32 points, shooting 9-of-17 from the field, along with five rebounds and three assists, leading Haifa to a 95–83 win over Hapoel Gilboa Galil. On December 22, 2019, Young tied his career-high 32 points, while shooting 7-of-11 from three-point range, along with eight rebounds and three steals in a 92–60 blowout win over Hapoel Holon. He averaged 20.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 1.4 steals per game for the team. In 2019-20 he was the top scorer in the Israel Basketball Premier League, with an average of 20.5 points per game.\nWestchester Knicks (2020–2021).\nOn December 14, 2020, Young was signed by the New York Knicks. He was waived before the start of the season and assigned to the Knicks' G League affiliate, the Westchester Knicks.\nHapoel Tel Aviv (2021–2022).\nOn March 8, 2021, he signed with Hapoel Tel Aviv of the Israeli Basketball Premier League.\nKolossos Rodou (2023).\nOn January 12, 2023, Young signed with Greek club Kolossos Rodou for the rest of the season. In 10 league games, he averaged 9.1 points and 3.3 rebounds, playing around 16 minutes per contest.\nUniverso Treviso Basket (2023–present).\nOn July 22, 2023, he signed with Treviso Basket of the Lega Basket Serie A."

        "title": "University of the West Indies cricket team",
        "text": "A cricket team representing the University of the West Indies (UWI) played several matches in West Indian domestic cricket during the early 2000s, and currently plays at lower levels.\nThe university's cricket team has been active since the school's foundation in 1948, and from the 1970s regularly played against touring international teams. With the backing of the university's Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Hilary Beckles, the university established a Centre for Cricket Research in 1994, and subsequently upgraded facilities at each of its three campuses, in Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. Again largely due to Beckles' involvement, UWI's team was invited to compete in the 2002–03 and 2003–04 editions of the Red Stripe Bowl, West Indian cricket's domestic limited-overs competition. The team won only one match in two seasons, and was subsequently dropped from the competition. However, prior to the 2007–08 season the university was involved in the establishment of a Combined Campuses and Colleges team, which effectively continues UWI's prior role in West Indian domestic cricket. Grounds at three of the university's campuses—the Sir Frank Worrell Cricket Ground in Mona, Jamaica; the Sir Frank Worrell Memorial Ground in St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago; and the 3Ws Oval in Cave Hill, Barbados—have been used for first-class matches.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe university was founded as the University College of the West Indies (UCWI) in 1948, originally serving as a constituent college of the University of London. With its main campus in Mona, Jamaica, the university gained academic independence in 1962, with new campuses having been established in St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago (1960), and Cave Hill, Barbados (1963). The sport of cricket was played at the school from the beginning, and the university's team participated in the Senior Cup, the main club cricket tournament in Jamaica. Participation in the sport was encouraged by Sir Frank Worrell, who was a member of the UWI's staff after his retirement from playing, and Professor Gladstone Mills, who was chairman of the university's Sports Advisory Committee. At the behest of Mills, in early 1971 the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) arranged for the touring New Zealand national cricket team to play a tour match against the university. This trend of visiting teams playing the university continued throughout the 1970s, with matches against India and Australia occurring later in the decade. However, these matches soon ceased, and from the early 1980s cricket matches were usually only played within the university. It was not until the late 1990s and the early 2000s that UWI began to again play a role in West Indian cricket. Led by the university's Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Hilary Beckles, a Centre for Cricket Research was established at the Cave Hill campus in 1994, which resulted in the refurbishment of the on-campus 3Ws Oval. Two years later, in 1996, Beckles convinced what was now the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to organise a match between the touring New Zealanders and a University of the West Indies Vice Chancellor's XI. Matches between touring sides and the Vice Chancellor's XI have since become a regular, almost annual, event.\nDomestic competition.\nIn July 2002, the WICB announced that the University of the West Indies would field a team in 2002–03 Red Stripe Bowl, the premier limited-overs competition in the West Indies. The inclusion of new teams was driven by former international player Wes Hall, the WICB's president at the time, who wished to strengthen the development of West Indian players outside of the usual regions. UWI's participation was largely a result of the efforts of Hilary Beckles, who had previously authored several texts on the history of West Indies cricket. Prior to its debut, the university gained the sponsorship of the Sagicor Financial Corporation, a Barbados-based firm. The team debuted in the competition in August 2002, in a match against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines at the Old Harbour Road ground in Port Esquivel, Jamaica. Although Saint Vincent had been pre-match favourites, UWI scored 269/7 and then restricted their opponents to 244/9, winning the match by 25 runs. UWI's team had included nine debutants to Saint Vincent's one, with only captain Dave Cumberbatch and wicket-keeper Andre Coley having played in the competition previously.\nPlaced in \"Zone A\" of the competition, alongside Saint Vincent, Barbados, Jamaica, and a \"Rest of Leeward Islands\" team, UWI lost each of its remaining three matches to finish in last place in its zone. These fixtures comprised a 102–run loss to Barbados, a nine-wicket loss to Rest of Leeward Islands, and a ten-wicket loss to Jamaica. Despite these losses, the university was kept in the competition for the following season. The team gained former West Indian international player Philo Wallace for the 2003–04 competition, as well as two other players with previous experience, prompting one commentator to predict that UWI would be the Bowl's \"most improved team\". Placed in \"Zone B\", with Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, and the West Indies under-19s, UWI lost three matches, with the other abandoned due to rain interruption. The university scored over 150 runs only once, against the under-19s team, and only one batsman, Shawn Graham, managed to score a half-century. Due to the overall lack of competition provided by UWI and the other newly introduced teams, the WICB announced in July 2004 that the Red Stripe Bowl would revert to the traditional six-team format. A list of matches the team played during its two seasons in the competition is given below:\nRecent years.\nAlthough UWI no longer had List A status, the university continued to play a large role in West Indian cricket from the mid-2000s onward. Grounds at the Cave Hill and St. Augustine campuses were used for warm-up matches at the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, and continue to be used occasionally for domestic matches. From the 2007–08 season onwards, UWI combined with other Caribbean universities to form the Combined Campuses and Colleges, which participates in domestic first-class, List A, and Twenty20 matches. However, the majority of the team's players attend UWI campuses. The demand for players has necessitated the introduction of cricket scholarships for players from other islands. In the late 2000s, the university's team was admitted into the Barbados Cricket Association (BCA), and has won four consecutive league titles from the 2009 season. In May 2010, the West Indies High Performance Centre, based at the Cave Hill Campus, was opened by the WICB, which the board's president, Julian Hunte, described as \"a very significant step forward in the future development of cricket in the Caribbean\". Later that year, the university's team participated as \"special guests\" at the American College Cricket Spring Break Championship, held in Florida."

        "title": "2013 Vuelta a España",
        "text": "The 2013 Vuelta a España was the 68th edition of the race. Chris Horner won the 2013 Vuelta at the age of 41 on 15 September 2013, becoming the oldest ever Grand Tour winner.\nHorner beat his nearest challenger, Italian Vincenzo Nibali, by finishing ahead of him in each of the final three mountainous stages before the final stage into Madrid.\nThis Vuelta started in Galicia on August 24, 2013. The race spent 5 days in Galicia, then continued anticlockwise touring Spain through Castile and León, Extremadura, Andalusia, Aragon, Catalonia, La Rioja, Cantabria, and Asturias, before returning to Madrid for the finish on September 15. The Vuelta included excursions into two neighboring countries, Andorra and France. The top three stage winners received the following bonuses in the general classification: 10 seconds for winners of the stages, six seconds for runners-up, and four seconds for those in third place.\nTeams.\nThe 19 UCI World Tour teams were automatically entitled to start the race; three wildcard teams were also invited.\n†: Invited Pro-continental teams\nRace overview.\nFor in-depth details see 2013 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11 and 2013 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21\nStage one was a team time trial (TTT) which was won by Astana and resulted in Janez Brajkovič being awarded the red jersey. Stage two was won by Vincenzo Nibali who also took over the red jersey, but on the next stage Chris Horner would win and claim the lead.\nThe race would eventually evolve into a battle between Horner and Nibali, who was attempting to win a very rare Grand Tour Double as he had won the Giro a few months earlier. Horner meanwhile was more of an outside contender for victory and prior to the start of this Vuelta he had more or less acknowledged this by announcing during a team meeting that he could finish top 10. Privately however, he told his wife and friends that he could podium as he felt he was in very good form following the 2013 Tour of Utah. After winning on stage three he told his team he could podium and told his wife he could win. Daniel Moreno would win stage four as Nibali would win back the jersey and hold it for the next few stages.\nLeopold König would win stage eight by one second over Daniel Moreno resulting in Nicolas Roche taking over the race lead. In stage nine Moreno would not be denied as he won his second stage, this one by four seconds, as he also took the red jersey from Roche by one second. Meanwhile, Nibali, Horner, former Vuelta champ Alejandro Valverde and Joaquim Rodríguez were all within a minute of the lead.\nUntil this point in the race Directeur Sportif for Team Radioshack José Azevedo had considered Horner's statement declaring he could make the podium, but still ran the team with the plan he had come into the race with. Only after Horner won again on stage ten and reclaimed the red jersey did he declare full team support for the American for the rest of the race. Stage eleven was an individual time trial where Nibali put time into all of the riders close to him in the standings reclaiming the red jersey yet again.\nOnce again Nibali would maintain the lead for the next several stages. In stage eighteen Vasil Kiryienka would win the day as Horner took +0:25 out of Nibali to come within just three seconds of the lead. Stage nineteen saw the riders contend with the Monte Naranco where Rodríguez won the stage and pulled within a minute of Valverde for the final podium position. Horner took another six seconds from Nibali and reclaimed the red jersey by three seconds, but for all intents and purposes they were neck and neck going into the final mountain stage, which culminated on the Alto de l'Angliru. Rodríguez and Valverde were not far behind going into this decisive stage and if Nibali and Horner were to attack one another to the breaking point, either of these two riders could be in a position to steal the race. Horner was concerned about Nibali being considerably stronger than he was in the final sprint to the finish so his plan was to defeat him on the mountain. Nibali also intended to win on the mountain and he did attack Horner on numerous occasions, but Horner was able to seal his only grand tour victory by responding to every attack and eventually riding away from everyone except for the final surviving breakaway rider in Kenny Elissonde.\nClassification leadership table.\nThere were four main classifications contested in the 2013 Vuelta a España, with the most important being the general classification. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the red jersey; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the Vuelta. In 2013, there were time bonuses given on mass-start stages; ten seconds were awarded to the stage winner, with six for second and four for third.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and is identified with a green jersey. There was also a mountains classification. The organisation categorised some climbs as either hors catégorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a blue polka dot jersey.\nThe fourth individual classification was the combination classification, marked by the white jersey. This classification is calculated by adding the numeral ranks of each cyclist in the general, points and mountains classifications – a rider must have a score in all classifications possible to qualify for the combination classification – with the lowest cumulative total signifying the winner of this competition.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. For the combativity award, a jury gives points after each stage to the cyclists they considered most combative. The cyclist with the most votes in all stages leads the classification. For the daily combative winner, the rider in question donned a dossard with a red background, on the following stage."

He was captain of the Romanian Rugby team in 1974 and 1975,\na period when Romania's National Rugby Team gained respect in both hemispheres of the rugby world. Alexandru led a highly motivated and talented Romanian Rugby Team to wins against France 15–10 in Bucharest, the FIRA – Association of European Rugby championship, and obtained a 10–10 draw against the New Zealand Junior All Blacks in Wellington.\nAlexandru Pop played rugby from 1963 to 1979. Between 1970 and 1975, he played for Romania 36 times, 19 of which were Test Matches. In 1976, Alexandru retired from playing international rugby. He took the time to focus on his engineering career, play rugby for his own club, and coach the under-19 teams for both his club and his country.\nWhile the August-1975 draw against the Junior All Blacks in Wellington was a surprise to the rugby world, the New Zealand experts surmised that, \"The Romanians would probably have won had they trusted their running rather than their kicking.\nIn 1975 Alexandru Pop was awarded the Honored Master of Sport title by the Romanian Rugby Federation.\nSponsored by former United States Eagles and Philadelphia Whitemarsh Rugby Football Club coach George Betzler, Alexandru immigrated with his family to United States in December 1982. Since 1983, he and his family have lived in Southern California.\nAlexandru Pop's rugby career was covered in several Romanian rugby books such as \"The 15 in the Carpathians\" and \"Rugby – Small Encyclopedia\".\nPop and his son Max visited the Romanian Rugby delegation to the 2011 Rugby World Cup, in New Zealand."

        "text": "Christopher James Hogan (born October 24, 1987) is an American former football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons. He played college football for the Monmouth Hawks following three years of college lacrosse with the Penn State Nittany Lions. Hogan was a member of five NFL teams, most notably the New England Patriots.\nJoining the NFL as an undrafted free agent, Hogan landed his first roster spot in 2012 with the Buffalo Bills, where he played four seasons. After signing a three-year contract with the Patriots in 2016, Hogan made consecutive Super Bowl appearances each season and won two. Hogan spent his final three seasons with the Carolina Panthers, New York Jets, and New Orleans Saints. He was also a lacrosse midfielder for the Cannons and Whipsnakes Lacrosse Club of the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) in 2021.\nEarly years.\nBorn and raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey, Hogan played both football and lacrosse for the Raiders athletic teams at Ramapo High School. He was a first-team all-state performer as a junior and senior in lacrosse and an all-state first-teamer as a senior in football.\nCollege career.\nPenn State.\nHogan chose to attend Pennsylvania State University on scholarship with the Nittany Lions men's lacrosse program. He started all 13 games as a freshman in 2007, scoring 11 goals, but appeared in just three games as a sophomore because of a high ankle sprain. In 2009, Hogan had 29 goals on 133 shots and was named first-team All-ECAC as well as voted captain for his senior season. He graduated in 2010 with one year of college sports eligibility remaining.\nIn recognition of his collegiate background, Hogan would reference Penn State's lacrosse program during his intro in NFL games broadcast by NBC. Hogan stated that this was because he wanted to acknowledge the school he started at and graduated from, although he would have referenced both Penn State and his college football team at Monmouth if given the opportunity.\nMonmouth University.\nTaking advantage of the year of college eligibility remaining after his 2008 ankle injury, Hogan chose to enroll at Monmouth University to play football for the Hawks. He immediately secured a spot as a quarterback/receiver, and also played at cornerback due to injuries in the secondary, and on all special teams units. He finished his one-year college football career with three touchdown passes, 12 receptions for 147 yards and three touchdowns on offense, and 28 tackles and three interceptions on defense.\nProfessional career.\nOutside of his speed, Hogan is also noted for his strength as a wide receiver. At his 2011 Pro Day, Hogan pumped 28 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press. This would have been a record for wide receivers at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nSan Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Miami Dolphins.\nOn July 27, 2011, the San Francisco 49ers signed Hogan as an undrafted free agent. On September 3, 2011, he was released by the 49ers. On September 12, 2011, Hogan was signed by the New York Giants and was placed on the practice squad. On September 23, 2011, he was released by the Giants.\nOn December 27, 2011, Hogan was signed to the Miami Dolphins' practice squad. On January 3, 2012, he signed a reserve/future contract with the Dolphins. In 2012, he was among the final cuts at the end of training camp, but he was re-signed to the Dolphins' practice squad. On September 11, 2012, his practice squad contract was terminated by the Dolphins.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn November 6, 2012, the Buffalo Bills signed Hogan to their practice squad. On December 18, 2012, Hogan was promoted to the active roster. On October 3, 2013, he recorded his first career reception against the Cincinnati Bengals. On October 12, 2014, against the New England Patriots, Hogan caught his first NFL touchdown on an eight-yard pass from quarterback Kyle Orton. Hogan had a breakout season for the Bills in 2014, recording 41 receptions for 426 yards and four touchdowns.\nIn the 2015 season, Hogan played in all 16 games for the Bills for the third consecutive season. He caught his first touchdown of the season in a win against his former team, the Miami Dolphins, and had his best game on a \"Monday Night Football\" game against the New England Patriots, catching six passes for 95 yards. In Week 5, against the Tennessee Titans, Hogan threw his first career NFL pass, a four-yard pass to quarterback Tyrod Taylor. The pass came on a drive that fueled the Bills to a 14–13 win. Hogan also had his first career rushing attempt during the season, which went for four yards. Hogan ended the 2015 season with 36 receptions for a career-high 450 yards and two touchdowns.\nNew England Patriots.\n2016 season.\nOn March 10, 2016, Hogan, a restricted free agent, signed a three-year offer sheet with the New England Patriots for $12 million, with $7.5 million guaranteed. The contract was front-loaded ($5.5 million in 2016) to make it difficult for the Bills to match. This occurred as head coach Bill Belichick saw major potential describing Hogan as a \"burner\" with incredible athleticism. On March 11, the Bills declined to match the offer sheet, receiving no draft compensation because of their original minimum salary one-year tender.\nDuring a Week 1 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals on \"NBC Sunday Night Football\", Hogan scored the first touchdown of the season for the Patriots on a 37-yard pass from quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. In the Patriots' Week 5 matchup against the Cleveland Browns, Hogan had a career-high of 114 receiving yards, this time with Tom Brady as his quarterback. In Week 8, while playing against his former team in Buffalo, he caught four passes for 91 yards, including a then-career-long 53-yard touchdown reception. In Week 12, against the New York Jets, Hogan became the third Patriots wide receiver in as many seasons to attempt a pass; while Hogan's left-handed pass was incomplete, it drew a 31-yard defensive pass interference penalty. He also passed his previous career-best for receiving yards in a season with 461 yards on 21 receptions (20.1 yards per catch, then trailing only injured teammate Rob Gronkowski for the NFL lead at 21.6). In Week 14, on \"Monday Night Football\", he caught a 79-yard touchdown pass against the Baltimore Ravens, the longest of his career (and the seventh longest in the NFL through Week 14), part of another career-best 129 yards on five receptions. He ended the season with 38 receptions for 680 yards and 4 touchdowns; his 17.89 yards per catch was second only to DeSean Jackson's 17.95. In the postseason, Hogan had four receptions for 95 yards in a win over Houston, followed by nine receptions for 180 yards and two touchdowns in the win over Pittsburgh. These were career highs in all three categories, and a Patriots playoff record for receiving yards in a single game. On February 5, 2017, Hogan was part of the Patriots team that won Super Bowl LI. In the game, he had four receptions for 57 yards as the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–28 in overtime.\n2017 season.\nIn Week 2, against the New Orleans Saints, Hogan had five receptions for 78 yards and his first touchdown of the 2017 season. In addition, he recovered an onside kick in the fourth quarter. By Week 5, Hogan already had a career-best five touchdowns on the season. On October 29, against the Los Angeles Chargers, Hogan injured his right shoulder and had to miss a few games. On December 11, he made his return and recorded one reception for five yards in a 27–20 loss to the Miami Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football\". Hogan helped the Patriots reach the Super Bowl for the second straight season after defeating both the Tennessee Titans in the and Jacksonville Jaguars in the . In Super Bowl LII, Hogan recorded six catches for 128 yards and scored a touchdown along with getting one carry for four yards. The Patriots lost to the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 41–33.\n2018 season.\nHogan appeared in all 16 games for the Patriots, but was used less than in previous seasons. Despite a promising Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, where he recorded his second career regular-season game with two receiving touchdowns in the 31–20 loss, he had over five targets in just two games, zero receptions in four games, and failed to break 80 yards in any game. His only other touchdown reception came in Week 15. His 532 receiving yards in the regular season was fifth on the team; he had been fourth in 2017 despite playing just nine games.\nThe Patriots reached their third straight Super Bowl after defeating both the Los Angeles Chargers in the and Kansas City Chiefs in the . Against the Chiefs in the AFC title game, Hogan had five catches for 45 yards, including a one-handed reception on third-and-8 in the fourth-quarter to sustain the Patriots' scoring drive to regain the lead at 31–28. In Super Bowl LIII, Hogan had no catches on six targets, but the Patriots won by a score of 13–3 against the Los Angeles Rams.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn April 12, 2019, Hogan signed with the Carolina Panthers. After four games where he recorded just three receptions, he was placed on injured reserve on October 2, 2019, with a left knee injury which required arthroscopic surgery. He was designated for return from injured reserve on December 11, 2019, and began practicing with the team again. He was activated on December 15, 2019.\nHogan had a tryout with the Detroit Lions on August 14, 2020.\nNew York Jets.\nHogan signed with the New York Jets on August 19, 2020. Hogan played in five games with 14 receptions for 118 yards. He was placed on injured reserve on October 13, 2020, with a high ankle sprain. He was waived from injured reserve on December 5, 2020.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn July 26, 2021, Hogan signed a one-year contract with the New Orleans Saints. He scored his first touchdown as a Saint on a ten-yard reception from Jameis Winston in Week 1 against the Green Bay Packers. He officially retired from the NFL on October 23, 2021. He played five games with the Saints in his final season.\nLacrosse career.\nIn February 2021, Hogan declared for the Premier Lacrosse League entry draft. He went undrafted before being acquired by the Cannons Lacrosse Club. On July 6, 2021, Hogan was traded along with faceoff specialist Drew Simoneau to the Whipsnakes in exchange for faceoff specialist Kevin Reisman.\nSponsorships and endorsements.\nIn 2015, Maximum Human Performance (MHP) announced the signing of Hogan to a sponsorship deal.\nPersonal life.\nHogan is married to Dr. Ashley Boccio, a podiatrist and Long Island native whom he met at Penn State when they were both lacrosse players. The couple have four children (Chase, Parker, Peyton, &amp; Carter). Ashley was pregnant during the Patriots' Super Bowl LI run and could not attend the game, but she did attend Super Bowl LII. While with the Patriots, Hogan stayed in Foxborough, Massachusetts, during the NFL season but drove down to his family home in Huntington, New York, on Monday nights, spending Tuesday there before returning to Foxborough. Hogan is of Irish descent."

During his tenure at the helm, Mills' coached 217 games over 11 seasons. Overall his teams won 151 games and lost only 66, the 151 wins remains 4th all-time in Illini history. During the Big Ten Conference season, Mills' teams won 88 games while losing only 47. Included in the 88 wins would be back-to-back conference titles in 1942 and 1943 where his teams would go 35-6 overall and 25-2 in the conference. Amazingly, Mills' three championships ('37, '42, '43) in just 11 years, place him just one behind Harry Combes, his replacement as head coach, for the most conference championships.\nAn attempt to regroup 'The Whiz Kids' occurred during the 1946-47 season when Ken Menke, Gene Vance, and Andy Phillip returned from their service in World War II. January also saw the return of All-American guard Walt Kirk from his time in military service. Additionally, Dike Eddleman was not available to play until January based on the football team playing in the Rose Bowl. Unfortunately, the chemistry was not the same and the team finished in a tie for second in the conference with a record of 8 wins, 4 losses. Overall, the team finished with a 14-6 record. The starting lineup at the beginning of the season included 4 of the 5 Whiz Kids, guards Smiley and Vance, forwards Phillip and Ken Menke and Fred Green at center.

A left-handed middle order batsman, he scored centuries in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Border scored 11,174 runs in 156 Tests and captained Australia in 93 of them. He holds the record for consecutive appearances (153 matches) as a player in Tests. Border was named by \"Wisden\" as one of its five Cricketers of the Year in 1982. He was the second Australian player after Sir Donald Bradman to receive the Order of Australia (AM) for his contribution to cricket, and was one of 55 initial inductees of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\nBorder made his Test debut against England in December 1978 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His first century came three months later against Pakistan at the same venue. Border's 27 Test hundreds were scored at 14 different grounds; 14 hundreds were made at venues outside Australia. In Tests, he was most successful against England accumulating eight centuries. Border's highest score of 205 – one of his two double centuries – came against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval in 1987. As of 2012, he is thirteenth overall in the list of most hundreds in Test cricket.\nIn ODI cricket, Border scored his first century against India in 1980, when he made 105 not out. The performance ensured Australia's victory and he was named \"Man of the match\". Border went on to score two more centuries until the end of his career – the first of them came against Sri Lanka (118) and the last one against West Indies (127), which was also his highest score in the format – he remained not out on both occasions."

        "title": "Equestrian seal",
        "text": "An equestrian seal is a type of seal used in the European Middle Ages, characterized by the depiction of the owner as a mounted warrior in full armour. Originating in the high medieval period (late 11th to early 12th century), the type was frequently used throughout the 13th to 14th centuries. Continued use into the 15th and 16th centuries was mostly limited to high nobility, especially royalty, while lower nobility switched to the use of simple heraldic seals.\nEarly examples (before 1170).\nEarly examples of equestrian seals are known from the second half of the 11th century. The oldest example that may be addressed as an \"equestrian seal\" is that of William I of England (c. 1067). Among the oldest extant examples in Germany is the seal of Henry of Laach (c. 1090). The horseman is characterized by the kite shield and a conical helmet, often bearing a banner. This type is continued into the mid-12th century, and late examples of kite shields are found into the 1160s.\nHigh medieval seals (1170–1300).\nThe peak of usage comes with the development of the tradition of chivalry in the high medieval period, during c. the last quarter of the 12th century and throughout the 13th century. Seals of the 1170s to 1190s show shield shapes transitional between the \"kite\" and the \"heater\" type. Helmet shapes become less conical and more rounded. The horseman is now shown as the prototypical \"knight\" with a heraldic shield. From about the 1230s, the horse is increasingly shown as wearing a heraldic caparison, and the rider as wearing a great helm.\nAround the middle of the 13th century, there was a fashion to also represent ladies and ecclesiastics on horseback on their seal, not wearing armour, but, as in the cases of Joan, Countess of Flanders (c. 1240), Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria (c. 1250) and Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant (c. 1260) practicing falconry.\nLate medieval seals (1300–1550).\nAfter 1300, equestrian seals were almost exclusively used by the high nobility, by bearers of the rank of duke or higher. Representations in seals of the 14th century show the nobleman with full heraldic achievements, often carrying a heraldic flag, or with a lance in full jousting armour.\nLate forms (after 1550).\nLate forms were used well into the early modern period in France and Germany. Depictions of monarchs in full armour, crested helmets, with lances or heraldic flags etc. fell out of use with the end of the joust in the early 17th century. Frederick the Great of Prussia used a \"Majestätssiegel\" which depicted him on horseback in 1772 (albeit no longer depicted as a fully armored knight but as a military commander).\nThe reverse of the Great Seal of Charles I of England (1627) shows the monarch in full gallop, wearing a fanciful classicist armour, accompanied by a hunting dog. The British monarchs from 1707 onward continued the convention of depicting the seated and crowned monarch on the obverse, and the monarch on horseback on the reverse. This is the case also for the queen regnants (, Queen Victoria, ), who are depicted in sidesaddle.\nIn 1976, Austria minted a commemorative gold coin (13.5g 90% Au) on the occasion of the millennial anniversary of the Babenberg dynasty (Leopold I, Margrave of Austria), known as the \"\". The obverse of this coin was designed in the style of a medieval equestrian seal (with the addition of an alpine panorama).\nModern heraldic forms.\nIn heraldic art, influenced by the equestrian seals, horsemen are a fairly common symbol. Two widely popular forms that the horseman takes is as the \"Pahonia\" and Saint George fighting the dragon. While these symbols are used in various coats of arms, they are arguably most famous as the Coat of arms of Lithuania and the Coat of arms of Moscow respectively."

        "text": "The Sri Lanka national cricket team toured India during the 1997–98 cricket season, playing three Test matches and three One Day Internationals (ODIs). Both series were drawn; all three Tests were draws, and each side won one of the ODIs, tying the series 1–1. The other ODI, which was held on 25 December, was abandoned after three overs had been bowled, when after discussion between the two captains and the match referee, it was determined that the inconsistent bounce of the pitch was too dangerous for the players. This was the first occasion on which an international cricket match had been called off for this reason.\nThe third ODI was marred by umpiring controversy and disruption from the crowd. During India's innings, Ajay Jadeja was given out, after being caught behind. The umpire initially raised his finger to dismiss the batsman, but then changed his mind, and continued raising his finger to adjust his hat. He then turned down the appeal, and Jadeja continued to bat. Elmo Rodrigopulle, writing for Cricinfo, reported that \"it was a mockery on the umpiring fraternity and what umpiring stands for.\" Later, in Sri Lanka's reply, when they were 205 for four, needing just 29 more runs for victory, the game was held up because spectators threw bottles onto the field. After a ten-minute delay, the match resumed, and Sri Lanka won by five wickets.\nThe tour began on 13 November, when the Sri Lankans played an Indian XI for Anshuman Gaekwad's benefit match, and concluded with the third ODI on 28 December. Sourav Ganguly was named player of the Test series, in which he was the leading run-scorer from either side, aggregating 392 runs. The most prolific batsman in the ODI series was Sri Lanka's Roshan Mahanama, who was named the player of the ODI series."

        "text": "The 2013 Ironman World Championship was a long distance triathlon competition that was held on October 12, 2013 in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. The event was won by Belgium's Frederik Van Lierde and Australia's Mirinda Carfrae. It was the 37th edition of the Ironman World Championship, which has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978. The championship is organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC).\nChampionship results.\nWomen.\nCarfrae broke Chrissie Wellington's course record of 8:54:02 set in 2009. She also lowered her own marathon course record of 2:52:09 set in 2011.\nQualification.\nFor entry into the 2013 World Championship race, amateur athletes were required to qualify through a performance at an Ironman or selected Ironman 70.3 race. Entry into the championship race could also be obtained through a random allocation lottery or through the Ironman’s charitable eBay auction. The division of athletes was divided into professional, age group, physically challenged, and hand cycle divisions.\nFor professional triathletes, the 2013 championship season marked the third year of a point system that determined which professional triathletes would qualify for the championship race. To qualify, points were earned by competing in WTC sanctioned Ironman and Ironman 70.3 events throughout the qualifying year. For the 2013 championship race that period is September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013. The top 50 male and top 35 female pros in points at the end of the qualifying year qualified to race in Kona. An athlete's five highest scoring races were counted in the point totals. At least one Ironman race must have been completed and only three Ironman 70.3 races count towards an athlete's overall point total. Prior champions received an automatic entry for the Championship race for a period of five years after their last championship performance provided that they competed in at least one full-distance Ironman race during the qualifying year. Their entry did not count toward the number of available qualifying spots.\nThe Ironman 2013 series consisted of 27 Ironman races plus the 2012 Ironman World Championship which was itself a qualifier for the 2013 Championship.\nYWC Sports purchase.\nIn June 2013, World Triathlon Corporation purchased YWC Sports, a private company that organizes triathlons and endurance sport events in Denmark. YWC Sports was contracted by the Challenge Family, a competing brand of WTC's Ironman races, to produce the long distance triathlon races Challenge Copenhagen and Challenge Aarhus. However, Challenge Family CEO Felix Walchshöfer did not wish to have WTC produce a Challenge licensed event and therefore terminated YWC's agreement stating that the sale to WTC constituted a breach of contract. As a result, the Challenge Copenhagen race, which was scheduled to race in August 2013, was rebranded as Ironman Copenhagen and 50 qualifying spots were offered up for the 2013 Ironman World Championships. Challenge Aarhus was replaced by Ironman 70.3 Aarhus and took place in June 2014."

        "title": "List of North Carolina Tar Heels basketball honorees",
        "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team was founded in 1910 to represent the University of North Carolina in intercollegiate competition and has participated in the sport all but one season since its inception. Over the course of the team's history, the Tar Heels' performance has ranged from losing records to undefeated seasons resulting in a national championship.\nDuring periods of both ascendancy and mediocrity, individual North Carolina players of exceptional ability have received various accolades. In total, Tar Heels have been named to an All-America team 83 times, an All-Atlantic Coast Conference team 138 times, and an All-Southern Conference team 34 times. Of the All-America selections, thirty-seven players received first-team honors a total of fifty-eight times. Sixteen players were named consensus first-team All-Americans a total of twenty-five times.\nTar Heels have won several nationally recognized individual awards, including the Bob Cousy Award, the Senior CLASS Award, Academic All-America of the Year, and several of the National Player of the Year awards. The College Basketball Hall of Fame has inducted four former North Carolina players, and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame has enshrined three. Five former North Carolina head coaches have also been inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame.\nAll-Americans.\nEach year, numerous publications and organizations release lists of All-America teams, hypothetical rosters of players considered the best in the nation at their respective positions. Some selecting organizations choose more than one roster of All-Americans, in which case they use the terms \"first team\", \"second team\", and \"third team\" as appropriate. Some selectors also award honorable mentions to outstanding players who did not make any of their teams.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a college sports governing body, uses officially recognized All-America selectors to determine the \"consensus\" selections. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team. Over time, the sources used to determine the consensus selections have changed, and since 1997, the NCAA has used these selectors to determine consensus All-Americans: Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC).\nIn 1923, Cartwright Carmichael was selected to the Helms first team, which made him the first North Carolina player to be named an All-American. In addition, Carmichael became the first Tar Heel first consensus All-American. Carmichael was also named a consensus All-American in 1924, which made him the first of seven North Carolina player to receive the honor twice. Of those seven players, Jack Cobb and Tyler Hansbrough are the only Tar Heels players to achieve consensus First-team All America honors three times in their collegiate career. Fifteen other Tar Heels have earned consensus First-team All-America honors twenty-three times throughout the program's history.\nAll-conference honorees.\nJust as the media recognizes the nation's best players with All-America lists, individual athletic conferences honor their best players with \"all-conference\" selections. In 1921, North Carolina joined the Southern Conference (SoCon). A year later, Cartwright Carmichael and Monk McDonald became the first Tar Heels named to an All-Southern Conference team. North Carolina was a member of the league from 1921 to 1953, and twenty-two Tar Heels received All-Southern Conference honors a total of thirty-four times.\nAfter the 1952 season, North Carolina and six other schools left the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The following year, the conference honored its inaugural season's best players with an All-ACC team. In that initial class, one Tar Heel, Jerry Vayda, was selected to the second team. Since 1953, North Carolina players have received first-team All-ACC honors a total of 73 times. Tar Heels have been named to All-ACC second or third teams an additional 64 times, although those teams have not been published continuously.\nIn 2002, the Atlantic Coast Conference published the \"ACC 50th Anniversary Basketball Team\", a list of the league's fifty best players from its first half-century as chosen by a 120-member committee. North Carolina had the most selections of the ACC members. The list included twelve former Tar Heels: Billy Cunningham, a Tar Heel forward and center from 1962 to 1965; Brad Daugherty, a center from 1982 to 1986; Walter Davis, a guard and forward from 1973 to 1977; Phil Ford, a guard from 1974 to 1978; Antawn Jamison, a forward from 1995 to 1998; Bobby Jones, a forward from 1971 to 1974; Michael Jordan, a guard from 1982 to 1984; Larry Miller, a forward from 1964 to 1968; Sam Perkins, a forward and center from 1981 to 1984; Lennie Rosenbluth, a forward from 1954 to 1957; Charlie Scott, a guard from 1967 to 1970; and James Worthy, a forward from 1979 to 1982.\nAward Recipients.\nVarious organizations bestow awards recognizing the best player overall or at a specific position, and some of these annual awards are considered highly prestigious honors. In 1926, forward Jack Cobb was named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year, the most outstanding intercollegiate men's basketball player in the United States. George Glamack won the Helms award for player of the year for two consecutive years, in 1940 and 1941. In 1957, the Helms Foundation bestowed its player of the year award to Lennie Rosenbluth.

The only Tar Heel to repeat as winner of ACC Player of the Year was Larry Miller in 1967 and 1968. The ACC Rookie of the Year title was first awarded during the 1976 season and since its creation nine North Carolina players have won the award, with the most recent being Harrison Barnes in 2011. Nine North Carolina basketball players have won the Anthony J. McKevlin Award for the ACC's male athlete of the year ten times. The lone Tar Heel to win the award twice was Phil Ford in 1977 and 1978.\nAfter his national championship-winning season in 1957, Frank McGuire received Coach of the Year honors from the UPI and the ACC. Dean Smith won the ACC Coach of the Year eight times before retiring. Smith also won coach of the year from the NABC in 1977 for leading the Tar Heels to the National Championship Game and from the NABC in 1993 after he helped coach the Tar Heels to a national championship victory. In 1998 Bill Guthridge won the Coach of the Year awards for the Naismith, NABC, and ACC. Matt Doherty won the AP Coach of the Year award in 2001. The Commonwealth Athletic Club of Kentucky presented its Coach of the Year award, the Adolph Rupp Cup, to Roy Williams in 2006 for leading the Tar Heels to the NCAA Tournament after much of the roster due to graduation or for the NBA draft.\nHall of Fame inductees.\nThe National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame has commemorated many of the sport's most outstanding and most innovative personalities. Among them are four former North Carolina players and five former North Carolina head coaches."

        "text": "The San Francisco Dons women's basketball team represents the University of San Francisco in NCAA Division I women's college basketball. The Dons play in the West Coast Conference and their home games at the Sobrato Center's War Memorial Gymnasium, with occasional games played at Chase Center.\nHistory.\nSan Francisco began play in 1976. Their first postseason appearance was in the 1980 AIAW National Division I Basketball Championship, losing 92–58 to BYU in the First Round. They made appearances in the NCAA Tournament in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2016, with a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1996. That year, USF (ranked as a 5 seed) beat Florida 68–61, and Duke 64–60 before losing to Connecticut 72–44. They have made the WNIT three times. They played in the NCAC from 1977 to 1982 and the NORPAC from 1982 to 1985 before joining the West Coast Conference in 1985. As of the end of the 2015–16 season, the Dons have an all-time record of 546–595.\nThe Dons saw a major restructuring in the offseason between the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons. Two of their graduate-level starters, Ioanna Krimili (presently the 3-point record holder at USF) and Kennedy Dickie, transferred to UC Berkeley and Portland respectively. The San Francisco Chronicle described the transfers as happening all across the West Coast Conference, both between schools and out of the conference.\nMolly Goodenbour abuse allegations.\nIn 2022, a lawsuit was filed against head coach Molly Goodenbour with USF named as a secondary defendant by former players Marta and Marija Galic. The Galic sisters, both overseas student athletes from Croatia, allege that Goodenbour “archaic and abusive conduct”, highlighting an instance where Goodenbour refused to allow Marta Galic to go to the bathroom and thereby forcing her to urinate on herself in front of her teammates. Marija Galic additionally states in the filing that Goodenbour succumbed her to verbal and psychological abuse, causing her to suffer from nervous breakdowns, and that Goodenbour did not follow the proper concussion protocols.\nGoodenbour and USF responded to the suit by denying an intent to cause the harm the sisters described. Both further argued that the bathroom incident described by the sisters never happened. Mike Vartain, a lawyer for USF, commented Goodenbour would never want a player to urinate their pants, and that no such prohibition on going to the bathroom without asking would exist.\nThe scandals revolving around Goodenbour, concurrent with abuse scandals surrounding Dons baseball coach Nino Giarratano, are credited with inciting the 2022 resignation of USF's athletic director Joan McDermott.\nPostseason.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Dons made one appearance in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 0–1. \nAIAW Division II.\nThe Dons made one appearance in the AIAW National Division II basketball tournament, with a combined record of 0–1."

        "text": "The FIFA Club World Cup is an international association football competition organised by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship was first contested as the FIFA Club World Championship in 2000. It was not held between 2001 and 2004 due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. Following a change in format which saw the FIFA Club World Championship absorb the Intercontinental Cup, it was relaunched in 2005 and took its current name the season afterwards.\nThe current format of the tournament involves seven teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks; the winners of that year's edition of the Asian AFC Champions League, African CAF Champions League, North American CONCACAF Champions League, South American Copa Libertadores, Oceanian OFC Champions League and European UEFA Champions League, along with the host nation's national champion, participate in a straight knockout tournament.\nAt the end of each final tournament, several awards are attributed to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves from the rest in different aspects of the game. Spanish club Barcelona has been the only club to earn every award in one edition, a feat accomplished during the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup. Barcelona, along with Real Madrid, are also the only sides to have earned three FIFA Fair Play Trophies. Lionel Messi is also the only player to have won two Golden Ball awards. Uruguayan player Luis Suárez holds the record for the most goals scored in one edition (five in 2015).\nAwards.\nThere are currently three awards:\nThe following two awards are no longer given:\nThe winners of the competition also receive the FIFA Club World Cup Champions Badge; it features an image of the trophy, which the reigning champion is entitled to display on its kit until the final of the next championship. The badge was first presented to Milan, the winners of the 2007 final. Initially, all four previous champions were allowed to wear the badge until the 2008 final, where Manchester United gained the sole right to wear the badge by winning the trophy.\nEach player from the clubs finishing third, second and first also receive one bronze, silver and gold medal each, respectively.\nGolden Ball.\nThe Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA Club World Cup, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the \"Silver Ball\" and \"Bronze Ball\" awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively.\nFrom 2005 to 2021, the winner of the Golden Ball was also presented with a separate trophy by the tournament sponsor. This was discontinued from the 2022 edition. The name of the award has varied:\nMan of the Match.\nThe Man of the Match award was introduced in 2013 FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco. The award is given to the best player in each tournament match by the FIFA Technical Study Group.\nSix players have won two man of the match awards:\nThe name of the award has varied based on the tournament sponsor:\nFIFA Fair Play Trophy.\nThe FIFA Fair Play Trophy is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the Club World Cup tournament. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Award, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.\nReal Madrid is the only club to have won four FIFA Fair Play Trophies. \nGolden Shoe.\nThe Golden Shoe award went to the top goalscorer of the FIFA Club World Cup. It was only awarded at the inaugural tournament in 2000. If more than one player finishes the tournament with the same number of goals, the tie goes to the player who has contributed the most assists (with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such). \"Silver\" and \"Bronze Boots\" are awarded to the second- and third-placed players.\nFIFA All-Star Team.\nThe \"FIFA All-Star Team\" is a squad of the best players of the tournament. It was only awarded at the inaugural tournament in 2000. The squad includes eleven starters and seven substitutes."

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia took place at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. It was held from 17 to 23 September. There were 24 competitors from 24 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Rob Waddell of New Zealand, the nation's first victory in the event after bronze medals in 1920 and 1988. Defending champion Xeno Müller of Switzerland placed second, becoming the 11th man to win multiple medals in the event. Marcel Hacker of Germany took bronze; it was the 11th consecutive Games with a German rower on the podium in the event (including the United Team of Germany, East Germany, West Germany, and Germany).\nBackground.\nThis was the 23rd appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nSeven of the 21 single scullers from the 1996 Games returned: gold medallist Xeno Müller of Switzerland, silver medallist Derek Porter of Canada, fifth-place finisher (and 1992 silver medallist) Václav Chalupa of the Czech Republic, seventh-place finisher Rob Waddell of New Zealand, eighth-place finisher Ali Ibrahim of Egypt, twelfth-place finisher Sergio Fernández González of Argentina, and eighteenth-place finisher (and 1992 fifth-place finisher) Jüri Jaanson of Estonia. Müller and Waddell were the top two scullers coming into the Games; Waddell had won the last two World Championships in 1998 and 1999 with Müller the runner-up both times. Porter was another contender, with a third-place finish at the latest World Championship (he had also won that event seven years earlier). Chalupa was also a perennial contender, with four silver and two bronze medals at the World Championships in the single sculls to go along with his 1992 Olympic silver (he would add a third bronze in 2001). Other challengers included veterans Jaanson and Fernández. \nAlgeria, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Slovakia, and Tunisia each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 19th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nDuring the first round four quarterfinal heats, each with 6 boats, were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages.\nThe repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final. Placing in the repechages determined which semifinal the boat would race in. Four heats were held, with 5 boats each. The top two boats in each repechage moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.\nFour semifinals were held, two each of A/B semifinals and C/D semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats moved on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final.\nThe fourth and final round was the finals. Each final determined a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in either the top one of their quarterfinal or top two of their repechage heat and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe winner of each heat advanced to the A/B semifinals, remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first two in each heat qualified for semifinals A/B, with the remainder going to semifinals C/D.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on 21 September 2000. For the C/D semifinals, the first three in each heat qualified for Final C, with the remainder going to Final D. Similarly, for the A/B semifinals, the top three went to Final A and the bottom three to Final B."

        "text": "The National Basketball League (NBL) was a professional basketball league in Japan run by the Japan Basketball Association (JBA). The first NBL season started in Autumn 2013, replacing the JBA's previous top-flight league, the Japan Basketball League. Below the NBL was the National Basketball Development League (NBDL), which was the successor to the former JBL 2 division.\nThe NBL and its predecessor existed alongside the bj league, an independent league based on the American sports franchise model that had been active since 2005. The JBA was suspended by FIBA in November 2014 for failing to address the fragmentation of the sport into competing leagues. As a condition of FIBA lifting the suspension in August 2015, the NBL and NBDL merged with the bj-league to form the B.League, which commenced in October 2016. Accordingly, the 2015-16 NBL season was the league's third and final season.\nTeams.\nThe league's initial season in 2013-14 consisted of twelve teams. The eight teams that participated in the final season of the JBL1 joined the league, as well as the JBL2 champion Hyogo Storks. The Chiba Jets returned to the JBA system after playing two seasons in the bj-league, including a 9th-place finish in 2012-13. intended to join the NBL after finishing third in their first JBL2 season in 2012-13, but subsequent financial difficulties saw them withdraw their application. They were replaced by the newly formed Tsukuba Robots, who submitted a separate application for entry to the league. The twelfth team to join the league was the Kumamoto Volters, who had been seeking entrance into the JBL2 since 2009. Three NBDL teams were given associate membership status, allowing for the possibility of their future promotion to the NBL. However, all three teams (Renova Kagoshima, Tokyo Excellence and Toyota Tsusho Fighting Eagles) ultimately remained in the NBDL for the duration of the competition's existence.\nThe 2014-15 season saw the Hiroshima Dragonflies enter the league as an expansion team and the Tsukuba Robots transfer from the Western Conference to the Eastern Conference. The Wakayama Trians, who were runners up in the league's first season, withdrew midway through the 2014-15 season in January 2015 due to financial difficulty and were refused entry into the 2015-2016 season. In March 2014 the league issued a public call for expansion teams to join the NBL or NBDL for the 2015-16 season. The Tokyo Hachioji Trains joined the NBDL but the NBL remained at twelve teams. The league abandoned the two-conference system in 2015-16, with teams instead playing five matches against each other for a total 55-game regular season. "

        "text": "The South African Rugby Legends Association (SARLA or SA Rugby Legends) is a non-profit organisation operating in South Africa. It is composed of former Springboks and Provincial rugby union players and provides a platform from which retired professional rugby players can make a meaningful contribution to the growth and devleopment of rugby in South Africa and beyond. The objective of the association is to raise money in aid of charitable causes and to provide sports coaching and life skills training to youngsters from previously disadvantaged areas in the country. SARLA / SA Rugby Legends also runs the South African Rugby Union (SARU) endorsed sustainable development rugby programme named Vuka.\nHistory.\nFounded in 2001, the South African Rugby Legends Association is a registered non-profit company (NPC) with two complementary objectives: Developing rugby at the grassroots level through our Vuka Rugby programme and our national Iqhawe week tournament, as well as supporting the needs and interests of former professional rugby players in South Africa. The South African Rugby Legends Association was started by South African entrepreneur and Executive Chairman of Richmark Holdings, Gavin Varejes. Since the inception of SARLA, the organisation has made a massive contribution to the development of rugby in previously disadvantaged areas around the country, as well as unearthing new talent that may have not had the opportunity to grow in the game. Two prime examples are Springbok and Harlequins prop Babalwa Latsha (the first SA women to earn a professional rugby contract) and current Blitz Bok star Zain Davids. The Vuka Rugby programme and Iqhawe Week has also provided a pathway for young talent to succeed not only on the rugby field but off the field. \nCurrent Legends in SARLA.\nThe following former rugby players are an instrumental part of the organisation:\nSA Rugby Legends Iqhawe week.\nIqhawe Week is South Africa’s premier rugby development tournament for u15 boys and girls. The first Iqhawe Week was held in Cape Town in September 2013, as a joint venture between the SA Rugby Legends and the South African Rugby Union. The aim was to create a pathway for players from new, introductory, small, rural, lower-league and non-traditional rugby schools to participate in a tournament equal in stature to the National Craven Week and Grant Khomo Weeks. Players begin playing rugby in the SA Rugby Legends Vuka programme move into the regional Legends Cup tournaments and the top players in each province then get selected to play in the Hollywood Foundation Iqhawe week. Numerous players from the Hollywood Foundation Iqhawe week have gone on to play provincial rugby and earn degrees while participating in the Varsity Cup. 20 players from the 2022 Hollywood Foundation Iqhawe week earned scholarships to more established rugby schools in 2023. One of the most recent success stories is Mawande Mdanda who participated in the 2018 Iqhawe Week. Mdanda went onto received a bursary to attend Maritzburg College, where he played in the First XV, was selected for the 2020 Sharks Craven Week team . He received a junior contract with the Vodacom Blue Bulls and was part of the squad that won all three SA junior tournaments - U19 / U20 / U21 - in 2022. In 2023 he was selected to the Junior Springbok squad and played in the Junior World Championships of that year. \nVuka Rugby Development Program.\nSARLA started a grassroots rugby development programme called Vuka (awakening or wake up in the Zulu language) in 2008. Since then, over 30 000 disadvantaged youngsters per year, all over the country, have been given an opportunity to develop rugby and life skills by partaking in the programme.\nPress Coverage.\nSARLA regularly features in the South African online and printed press. Selected press coverage includes:\nContribution to Charity.\nSARLA and Gavin Varejes donate time and funds to a variety of charities. Since the beginning this has been one of the core values of the organisation to give back to those in need. This includes suppoprting fund raisign efforts of charitable organisations, contributing to feeding schemes, food parcel handouts across the country during the height of the Covid pandemic and highlighting other important social causes."

For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.)."

        "title": "Table tennis in the United States",
        "text": "Table tennis in the United States is regulated by USA Table Tennis. USATT Historian Tim Boggan has written a volume of books entitled “History of U.S. Table Tennis” to give the readers a brief overview of how the sport of table tennis came to be. There are a total of 19 books in the series. Table tennis was initially considered an alternative to lawn tennis at parties and events. However, the rapid rise in popularity of table tennis reached worldwide and caught attention in the United States. In 1993, the official governing body of the United States Table Tennis Association was created. The sport was not named ping pong since that name was already taken from by the Parker Brothers. The non-profit corporation version of the United States Table Tennis Association truncated their name to “USA Table Tennis”.\nRules and regulations.\nThe rules and regulation of US Table Tennis vary depending on whether or not the game is for a tournament or just an exhibition match.  The rules on a tournament game are strict in terms or how much the player can do.  For example, when serving the player must throw the ball at least six inches straight up in the air and there must be no additional spin on the ball. The ball must be stationary on the palm behind the end line. If the ball dips under the table before the serve or starts in front of the end line, then the service is fowled. Additionally, the ball must be visible at all times. Again, if the ball is not visible, then the server forfeits the point.  The fouls are different.  If a ball is too short for the player to reach and they place their non-paddle hand over the table then play stops and the opponent receives the point.\nTournaments.\nDuring tournaments teams play in either singles or doubles teams.  During a singles game the rules are different from a doubles match.  For example, in a doubles match the server must serve the ball across the net and into the opposite box.  However in a singles match the server can serve the ball any way they like.  The prize of a tournament can vary as well.  For example a local tournament would not have as high of a payout as a national tournament which could have a payout of $100,000 or more to the winning team.\nPlayer ratings.\nPlayers get ranked depending on how well they play and relative to other players.  The higher the rating the better the player.  Different tournaments can improve a players rating depending how what level the tournament is played at. National Team members are selected by high performance director Joerg Bitzigeio.\nTactics during play.\nAn article called “Adjusting Tactics in Tournament Play” talks about adjusting in-game techniques to boost the chances of winning.\nApproved equipment.\nA comprehensive list of all the approved equipment that can be used during official tournaments and matches are given. A few pieces of equipment are Butterfly, Cornilleau, Joola, Paddle Palace, and Zero Pong.  The paddles and balls must be inspected at the beginning of a match to prevent any cheating or foul play.  The tables are cleaned after every match to ensure that play carries on as fluidly as possible.  The balls are wiped to remove any dust to keep them as clean as possible to ensure perfect bounces.\nCoaching.\nA coaches salary may range from $25/hr to $50/hr depending on the type of coach. Usually private coaches make more than the average coach. Many coaches that coach professionally have a rank of at least 1800 or higher. However, there are still stories on which those of lower levels have become coaches. To become a certified coach one needs to register either on the USATT website or the USATT hotline. Those ranked higher will usually have an easier time getting certified. Coaches are also allowed to teach at colleges or other institutions to discuss the art of the sport.\nReferees.\nThe referees have different qualifications depending on the level of the match. The referees that are only at the local level only need low level certification. However the referees that want to go higher need more certification and also years of experience. The referees need to take tests and need to pass with scores of at least 85%.\nParalympics and Para Table Tennis.\nPara Table Tennis came into the spotlight in 1960 when the sport was incorporated into the 1960 Rome Paralympics. Para Table Tennis was also first included in the Olympic Games in Seoul 1988. Para Table Tennis was treated just as equally as the regular table tennis tournaments in which there are both men's and women's events. Para events are split into classes. Para 1 is the highest level of disability, while para 10 is the lowest level of disability. To put things in perspective, the para 1-5 classes are usually in wheelchair, while some of the para 9 and 10 players can compete on an international level with able bodied people."
