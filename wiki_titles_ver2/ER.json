        "text": "Bobby Gene Bennett (June 22, 1933 – May 31, 2020) was an American college baseball coach who was head coach at Fresno State from 1970 to 2002.\nBiography.\nBorn in Atwood, Oklahoma, Bennett attended Roosevelt High School in Fresno, California and graduated in 1951. In college, Bob caught for Fresno State, setting a school record for fielding in 1953 by going 224 chances without an error. Bennett began his coaching career in 1956 after graduating college with a degree in physical education. He was 41-19 from 1956 to 1957 at Kingsburg High School. He then spent 11 seasons coaching Bullard High School.\nBennett took a break from Bullard in 1967 to coach Fresno State when Pete Beiden took a sabbatical; the team went 38–10. When Beiden retired after 1969, Bennett became head coach, a job he held until his retirement in 2002. He would go 1,302-759-4 to finish 7th in NCAA Division I history in career victories; he only had two losing seasons in his career. He won 14 Conference Coach of the Year honors and was named NCAA Coach of the Year in 1988 by \"The Sporting News\".\nBennett coached for Team USA in 1977 and 1979 and managed the team in the 1983 Intercontinental Cup (when they won a silver medal) and 1986 Amateur World Series.\nBennett took Fresno State to the 1988 College World Series and 1991 College World Series.\nHe helped develop Dick Ruthven, Ron Johnson, Terry Pendleton, Eric Fox, Mark Gardner, Tom Goodwin, Steve Hosey, Bobby Jones, Todd Johnson, Jeff Weaver, Dan Gladden, Adam Pettyjohn and Dennis Springer among other major leaguers.\nIn May 2001, Bennett announced his intention to retire following the 2002 season. Bennett retired with a 1,302-759-4 win–loss record at Fresno State. His #26 was the first number ever retired by Fresno State. He was once president of the American Baseball Coaches Association as well. He was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame (1990), the ABCA Hall of Fame, and College Baseball Hall of Fame (2010).\nBennett continued in his retirement to coach players, lead instructional videos and practice as well as write literature related to baseball techniques and methods. Bennett was a poet and published a multitude of books over the years. Bennett continued to lead young players, was a motivational speaker and provided ongoing consultation to baseball coaches and players from the High School levels up to the Major Leagues.\nHis #26 was the first number retired at Fresno State and in 2016, the school renamed its baseball stadium \"Bob Bennett Stadium at Pete Beiden Field.\"\nHe died on May 31, 2020, at the age of 86."

        "text": "Desert Forest Golf Club is a par-72 golf course and club located in Carefree, Arizona. The course is 7201 yards long and located underneath Black Mountain in the Sonoran desert.\nHistory.\nDesert Forest Golf Club, Carefree, Arizona, was designed by Robert \"Red\" Lawrence in 1961 and established in 1962, becoming the first desert golf layout in the Southwestern United States and earning its designer the nickname of \"Desert Fox\". The course was created as a part of the development plans of club founders K.T. Palmer and Tom Darlington, who created the town of Carefree north of Scottsdale in the early 1950s. The course is located in the Sonoran desert at an elevation of about 2400–3000 feet. Very little earth was moved in the creation of the course, resulting in narrow, rolling fairways that follow the natural terrain. It is considered to be the first course in the western deserts to incorporate the desert itself into the course design, instead of imposing eastern designs onto the desert landscape. According to Scott Gummer of \"Links Magazine\", \"Beyond the boundary markers [the designer] staked, nothing was to be touched. Everything was—and remains today—in play, from the saguaro, ocotillo, prickly pear and myriad other varieties of cactus to the javelinas, coyotes, roadrunners and rattlesnakes that call the desert home.\"\n\"Golfweek\" has consistently ranked Desert Forest among the 50 best golf courses in the United States. Then in 2009 \"Golf Magazine\" ranked Desert Forest as the 35th best in the world on its list of the \"50 Greatest Courses of the Last 50 Years\", making it the only course in the state of Arizona to make that list. Author Jeff Barr named Desert Forest's holes number 7, 13, and 16 as among the most important holes in golf in his book \"1001 Golf Holes You Must Play Before You Die\". Over time the course has also ranked among the best in the US according to \"Golf Digest Magazine\", which began keeping a list of \"America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses\" (first as \"America's 100 Most Testing Courses\") in 1969, a list on which Desert Forest has appeared for a total of 17 of the years since. This makes it one of the most consistently ranked golf courses by the magazine in America.\nIn 2013 Golf Course Architect David Zinkand was engaged to create a new Master Plan for the golf course, and to oversee subsequent construction. The golf course was rebuilt from tee to green, including state of the art infrastructure. Changes and enhancements were made to accommodate the modern game, while staying true to the original Red Lawrence routing and use of the desert. Zinkand has created a masterful update of this classic American golf course.\nNational Championship Tournaments.\nIn 1990 Desert Forest hosted the USGA Senior Amateur Championship, over the week of October 15 to October 20, 1990. The winner of the tournament was Jackie Cummings, who won a semi-final match against Rick Jones after eliminating the 1988 Senior Amateur Champion Clarence Moore in the quarter-finals. Cummings became the youngest winner in the history of the championship at that time, winning at age 55 by defeating fellow finalist Bobby Clark.\nOver the week of September 29 to October 4, 2007, Desert Forest hosted the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur. The winner of the stroke-play event was Dawn Woodard, defeating runner-up Virginia Grimes by two strokes after shooting a 70 in the first round and a 74 in the second. The winner of the match-play event was Meghan Bolger, who defeated finalist Kerry Postillion (a Desert Forest member) 1-up in the championship round. The course has also hosted several other U.S. Mid-Amateur and U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur qualifiers previously. The course is also a previous host to other major tournaments including the Goldwater Cup on several occasions and the Phoenix Silver Pro AM in 1994."

        "text": "Stage 12 of the 2012 Vuelta a España was contested on 30 August, and the race concluded with Stage 21 on 9 September. The second half of the race was situated entirely within Spain; starting with a medium mountain stage from Vilagarcía de Arousa to the Mirador de Ézaro in Dumbría, before four summit finishes and, ultimately, the customary race-concluding ride into Madrid.\nHaving held the lead of the Vuelta since the fourth stage, Joaquim Rodríguez of maintained his lead into the second half of the race. On the twelfth stage, Rodríguez achieved his second stage victory after out-lasting his rivals for the general classification on the steep climb to Mirador de Ézaro in Dumbría, putting another twelve seconds onto his lead over rider Alberto Contador. After the breakaway succeeded the following day, Rodríguez achieved another stage victory on the fourteenth stage to the Puerto de Ancares, where the longer climbs started to come into force in the race as part of three summit finishes in three consecutive stages. Similar to the move at the Mirador de Ézaro, Rodríguez accelerated away from his closest competitor, Contador, extending his race lead to 22 seconds. The following day, all attacks were negated, as the breakaway succeeded again; Antonio Piedra took the first victory for at a Vuelta a España, winning the stage by two minutes.\nRodríguez and Contador remained together for most of the race's queen stage, the first finish at the Cuitu Negru; on gradients approaching 25% in places, Rodríguez gapped Contador by two seconds, with a four-second time bonus ultimately leaving the gap at twenty-eight seconds post-stage and into the second and final rest day of the race. Following the rest day, Contador turned the advantage around with a surprise attack around midway through the stage. He left his rivals for the overall behind, and soloed to the stage victory. Rodríguez struggled during the stage, being dropped by another one of the race contenders, Alejandro Valverde (), and fell to third in the overall standings behind Contador and Valverde. Contador maintained the lead of the race until the end, eventually winning the race for a second time by 1' 16\" over Valverde. Rodríguez was third, a further 21 seconds behind, with no other rider within ten minutes of Contador at the end of the race. Valverde took final-day victories in the points and combination sub-classifications, with Rodríguez losing the points competition in Madrid for the second year running after losing out to Bauke Mollema in 2011.\nStage 12.\nThe second half of the race commenced with a rolling stage starting in the Province of Pontevedra at Vilagarcía de Arousa, before it made its way into the Province of A Coruña and an ultimate summit finish at the Mirador de Ézaro. Despite not being the highest point of the stage, the Mirador de Ézaro provided a stern test for the remaining members of the peloton, as the average gradient of the long climb was over 13%, with certain sections of the climb reaching 20%, or higher. As a result of the short and steep climb, Joaquim Rodríguez, the race leader for , was considered as the main favourite for the stage – along with ninth stage winner Philippe Gilbert () – as he looked to restore some part of a race-leading margin nearly wiped out during the previous day's time trial. Mini-attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first two hours of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes.\nIt was not until the mark that an attack was allowed to gain substantial ground off the front of the main field. Four riders – Cameron Meyer of , 's Mikel Astarloza, rider Amaël Moinard and Kevin De Weert, representing the team – were allowed to freedom to create a lead of over seven minutes during the stage, but were gradually brought back and despite the chasing by the peloton, the lead quartet still held a lead of around half a minute at the bottom of the Mirador de Ézaro. Despite an attack by Astarloza's team-mate Igor Antón, were able to set Rodríguez up for his second stage victory of the race, with Alberto Contador () coming across the line eight seconds behind, having been the last rider to have been dropped by Rodríguez, to limit his deficit to thirteen seconds after time bonuses had been applied.\nStage 13.\nDespite its parcours being lumpy and undulating, the thirteenth stage was categorised as a stage for one of the sprinters to achieve a victory on, and potentially their last chance of a stage win until the following week as up until the rest day, the following three stages would all have summit finishes. There were two intermediate sprint points during the stages, offering points to the points classification and bonus seconds towards the general classification, coming in A Laracha at , and in Catabois from the finish in Ferrol. Ferrol was hosting the race for the first time since 1993, when Djamolidine Abdoujaparov won the penultimate stage of that year's race. Much like the previous day's stage, mini-attacks set the course of the early running, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first hour of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes.\nHowever, just after the mark, a group did form and was allowed to make a gap off the front of the field. Seven riders representing six teams – were the only squad to have two riders in the group – and achieved a lead of four minutes during the stage, with the peloton unwilling to let the advantage to anything larger. The gap was brought down at a quicker pace than normal, with and willing to bring it back for their sprinters John Degenkolb and Gianni Meersman respectively. However, the peloton never caught the breakaway during the stage, and after several moves with to go, 's Steve Cummings made a solo bid for victory with remaining, and remained clear until the end to take his first Grand Tour stage win, and his first victory for the team. 's Cameron Meyer bested Juan Antonio Flecha () for second place, four seconds behind Cummings, with the peloton led home by Degenkolb finished forty seconds behind Cummings.\nStage 14.\nThe race returned to the mountains for the first of three consecutive summit finishes, that were expected to alter the general classification standings. Instead of the short, punchy climbs that had featured in the race prior to the fourteenth stage, longer climbs were included in the stage's itinerary. There were five categorised climbs, with the steeper climbs coming towards the end of the stage; inside the final of the stage were two first-category ascents of the Alto Folgueiras de Aigas – averaging 6.7% for its length – and the final climb of the Puerto de Ancares which averaged 8.1%, but reaching almost 13% in places, en route to the summit at above sea level. The climb also contained a downhill section of around a kilometre in length, just after halfway up the climb.\nA four-rider move initially got clear in the opening kilometres of the stage, but they were brought back before of the parcours had been completed. After that, a larger group consisting of sixteen riders, including the four-time defending mountains classification winner David Moncoutié () and fourth stage winner Simon Clarke of advanced forward. With members of their respective teams in the breakaway as well, Joaquim Rodríguez's squad and the of Alejandro Valverde, sat back in the peloton and allowed and to control the pace for their respective protected riders Alberto Contador and Chris Froome. The leaders held a lead of over three minutes at one point, with the break splitting apart on the Alto Folgueiras de Aigas, and on the descent, Alberto Losada – Rodríguez's team-mate in the break – ventured off the front on his own. The peloton had reduced the gap to two minutes by this point, and were continuing to close the gap gradually as they reached the bottom of the final climb of the stage.\n maintained station at the front of the peloton, with Contador being paced by three of his team-mates, and his rivals Rodríguez and Valverde were in close order to him. With the pace being accelerated, the peloton was being reduced in numbers, with only the race contenders remaining after a time. Froome cracked on the climb at one point, but managed to recover sufficiently to rejoin the leaders' group – having caught and passed Losada – before eventually falling off the back again, eventually losing 50 seconds, falling to 1' 41 behind, after time bonuses were applied. Contador launched an attack with to go, and nobody followed immediately; however, Rodríguez eventually set off in pursuit of Contador, catching him with around a kilometre remaining. Contador made one last bid for victory, but Rodríguez had enough to combat the move, and eventually accelerated away from him and won his third stage of the race, gapping Contador by five seconds, and added nine seconds to his overall lead.\nStage 15.\nFor the second of the three consecutive summit finishes, the riders had to negotiate two categorised climbs – as well as the unclassified Puerto de Pajares – before the final climb, categorised as a climb of \"Categoria Especial\", to Lagos de Covadonga. Although the final climb was less steep in gradient compared to the climb before it, the Alto del Mirador del Fito – 7% compared to the latter's 8.3% – it reached 15% in places. As well as that, there were two sections of downhill – each of around in length – in the final of the climb, before ramping up again for the finish. In the early kilometres of the stage, a group of nineteen riders formed the early hallmarks of a breakaway group, before it was eventually established with ten riders in the group, as the peloton negotiated the windy conditions of the stage.\nThe lead group quickly built a lead then continually went up as the stage wore on, eventually reaching a maximum of around fifteen minutes on the Alto del Mirador del Fito; despite this lead, none of the ten riders were going to make any impact on the general classification as the best-placed rider in the group – Andrey Kashechkin of the team – was over 22 minutes down on the leader Joaquim Rodríguez of . Kashechkin tried to launch the first attack on the climb to Covadonga, but was brought back by 's Pablo Lastras; a second move by rider Antonio Piedra was more successful, and he continually pulled away from his breakaway companions, eventually winning the stage – his team's first at the Vuelta – by over two minutes. The remainder of the lead ten came to the line in individual groups, while the race leaders Rodríguez, Alberto Contador of and Lastras' team-mate Alejandro Valverde were over nine minutes in arrears. Valverde moved up to third overall, as 's Chris Froome lost 35 seconds to the lead trio.\nStage 16.\nThe last stage before the second and final rest day of the race, the sixteenth stage of the race was set up as the toughest day of climbing in the entire race, and as a result, was deemed the queen stage of the race. During its parcours, there were three categorised climbs and a fourth, to the finish, at Cuitu Negru; the climbs got harder as the stage wore on, with a third-category ascent of the Alto de la Cabruñana first, followed by the first-category climbs of the Puerto de San Lorenzo (8.5% gradient) and the Alto de la Cobertoria, a climb with an average gradient of 8.6%. The climb to Valgrande-Pajares and beyond to Cuitu Negru – a \"Categoria Especial\" climb just like the previous day's finish at Lagos de Covadonga – averaged 6.9% over its , but was much steeper in the final few kilometres, reaching almost 25% in places. Unlike previous years, the stage finished on a newly repaved section of road, just for the race, rather than finishing in Valgrande-Pajares.\nMini-attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first hour of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes. It was not until the descent of the first climb of the day, the Alto de la Cabruñana, that an attacking move was allowed to be established; the riders that instigated it, were Thomas De Gendt of – the winner of the queen stage at May's Giro d'Italia, at the Stelvio Pass – and rider Dario Cataldo. De Gendt and Cataldo quickly gained a substantial advantage over the rest of the field, picking up a lead of almost fourteen-and-a-half minutes while ascending the day's second climb at the Puerto de San Lorenzo. as the peloton negotiated the windy conditions of the stage. Behind, 's Simon Clarke kept a hold of his mountains classification lead, by accelerating out of the peloton to take the points on offer for third at the summit of the climb. The lead pairing reached the bottom of the final climb with a lead approaching eight minutes, with the peloton being led by , who were looking to protect Igor Antón on the climb.\n injected some pace into the group, and managed to split the group apart with ease before Nairo Quintana took to the front for the . Alberto Contador () took up the pace from his team-mates and formed a group with Quintana, his team-mate Alejandro Valverde and the race leader Joaquim Rodríguez of . Contador and Rodríguez rode tactically up the climb, and eventually managed to rid themselves of both Valverde and Quintana. However, their battles were only good enough for the places from third to sixth, as Cataldo and De Gendt stayed away from the field by over two-and-a-half minutes. Cataldo won the stage, as De Gendt ultimately cracked on the final climb, and gapped him by seven seconds to take his first Grand Tour stage win. Rodríguez extended his overall lead to 28 seconds over Contador, after gaining the third-place time bonus at the finish.\nStage 17.\nThe first stage after the second and final rest day, the seventeenth stage was the second last to have an uphill finish of some form; on this occasion, it was a long, second-category climb to Fuente Dé, but was not excessively steep at an average gradient of 3.9%. Prior to that, there were two other categorised climbs during the stage – both in the second half of the stage – with the third-category Collado de Ozalba and the second-category Collado La Hoz also on the itinerary for the stage, in length. The stage was ideally suited for rouleurs and not the overall contenders, who would be looking at the penultimate-day stage to the summit finish at , as their only remaining attempt to gain time before the finish the next day, in Madrid.\nMini-attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first two hours of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes. At one point, the overall leaders were in two separate groups with Alberto Contador () and 's Alejandro Valverde both in the group ahead of Joaquim Rodríguez before Rodríguez's squad closed the gap. Eleven riders representing eleven different teams eventually formed the day's breakaway after , with team-mates of both Contador and Valverde in the group. Their lead never hit much more than three minutes, before splitting on the Collado de Ozalba, and rider Arnold Jeannesson moved up from the peloton to join the leaders. A chase group formed on the descent from the climb, with three of Contador's team-mates among them. With the gap at 1' 14\" to the leaders at the foot of the Collado La Hoz, Contador attacked out of the peloton.\nRodríguez and Valverde tried to chase him, but Contador made it up to the lead group before the top of the climb. His team-mates helped push the gap up on the roads, while Rodríguez was struggling to react to the pace and only had Alberto Losada for support in the chasing group. Contador attacked again just before the intermediate sprint point at Potes, and only his former team-mate Paolo Tiralongo () was able to follow him. They held a two-minute gap over their closest rivals; Rodríguez was dropped on the lower slopes of the climb, as he was unable to follow Valverde, while Contador had gone solo off the front with around remaining. With help from team-mates Nairo Quintana and Beñat Intxausti, Valverde cut the advantage to Contador on the climb, but could not catch him. Contador eventually took his first victory since returning from suspension, six seconds ahead of a group containing Valverde, Sergio Henao of and 's Gorka Verdugo. Rodríguez came across the line tenth, 2' 38\" in arrears, dropping to third overall behind new leader Contador and Valverde, who moved up to second.\nStage 18.\nThe longest stage of the 2012 Vuelta a España, at , was a relatively flat affair with no categorised climbs during the stage, meaning that 's Simon Clarke would keep a hold of the blue polka-dot jersey as the mountains classification leader. A finishing circuit of about in length around Valladolid was also utilised, with two intermediate sprint points – in Valladolid itself, just before the first passage through the finish line, and before the finish in Zaratán – before an expected sprint finish. Valladolid was hosting the Vuelta for the first time since the 2008 edition of the race, when rider Wouter Weylandt won the seventeenth stage in a sprint finish.\nUnlike recent days, the breakaway was formed immediately after the start of the stage. rider Luis Ángel Maté, 's Gatis Smukulis and Martijn Keizer of attacked in the opening metres, and were later joined by Brent Bookwalter () and 's Gustavo César; none of the five riders were any threat in the general classification, as Maté was the best-placed of the quintet in 50th place overnight. They managed to achieve an advantage of over five minutes at one point during the stage, but they were all brought back inside of remaining in the stage. The field remained together until the finish, where and were holding station on the front. British national champion Ian Stannard tried to lead it out for team-mate Ben Swift, but Daniele Bennati () made up ground on Swift, and ultimately edged him out at the finish line by inches for his sixth Vuelta stage victory. Bennati later dedicated his first victory in almost a year to former team-mate Weylandt, who was killed during the 2011 Giro d'Italia.\nStage 19.\nMuch like the previous day's stage, there were no categorised climbs during the day and although more undulating than the eighteenth stage, it was still expected to potentially bring about a sprint finish at the end; however, an uphill finish in La Lastrilla made it equally capable of producing a result that would favour some of the puncheurs in the race, like Philippe Gilbert () or 's former race leader Joaquim Rodríguez, or even a breakaway to succeed on a rare occasion. Almost from the start, two of the wildcard teams had riders go out of the peloton and attack off the front, as 's José Vicente Toribio and rider Aitor Galdós initiated the breakaway, quickly mustering a healthy advantage. The duo's advantage went up at a rapid pace, reaching its maximum of over ten minutes less than a quarter into the stage. Several teams took up station on the front of the main field; some to bring back the gap for the sprinters, while others to set one up for their puncheurs.\nRain started to fall at the halfway point of the stage, but the gap between the leaders and the pack continued to gradually fall until they were eventually caught with remaining. An accelerated pace by the helped to split the peloton in Navas de Riofrío, with Valverde and Rodríguez both eventually taking bonus seconds at the intermediate sprint point in Hontoria. Several late-race attacks came and went, before Gilbert's stage-winning attack out of the peloton in the closing kilometre. He held on to his second victory of the race ahead of Valverde, Daniel Moreno () and Rodríguez. The rest of the field were led in three seconds later by 's Gianni Meersman; among the group was race leader Alberto Contador (), who lost 17 seconds on the day to Valverde, but remained 1' 35\" clear overnight in the general classification.\nStage 20.\nThe penultimate stage of the Vuelta was seen as the final chance for the riders to take substantial amounts of time in the race, with the final stage being the customary ride into Madrid. The parcours of contained no fewer than five categorised climbs, all rated as a second-category climb or higher, with the summit finish – the tenth of the race – to Bola del Mundo being the highest-categorised of the five, as a \"Categoria Especial\"; the Bola del Mundo was also the highest point of the race, with the stage winner receiving the Cima Alberto Fernández award. The peloton climbed up to a height of above sea level, via an long climb at an average gradient of 8.6%. The Bola decided the race for overall honours on its previous appearance in the race – in 2010 – as Vincenzo Nibali shadowed Ezequiel Mosquera up the climb, therefore winning the race by 41 seconds from Mosquera; Mosquera was later stripped of his results in late 2011.\nA group of twenty riders formed the day's breakaway, representing sixteen teams with , , and the only squads to have multiple representation in the group. Also among the group was the leader of the mountains classification, Simon Clarke (), who was looking to all but guarantee winning the blue polka-dot jersey. Indeed, Clarke took maximum points at the first three climbs during the stage, as the breakaway held a lead of around eight minutes – having reached a maximum of over ten minutes at one point – over the main field. The leaders remained five minutes clear of the peloton as they hit the Bola del Mundo, with the pack being led by , who had Romain Sicard in the lead group. The lead group started to splinter on the climb itself, with six riders going clear in the early stages, before three riders – 's Richie Porte, rider Kevin De Weert and former Vuelta overall winner Denis Menchov of – established themselves with the accelerated pace.\nIn the peloton, 's Igor Antón initially attacked without chase, before Alejandro Valverde () forced an attack on his rivals, trying to get clear before he was closed down. De Weert was dropped by his two lead companions, while the overall leaders had managed to break out into a group of their own with Valverde, Alberto Contador () and Joaquim Rodríguez being paced by Rodríguez's 's team-mate Daniel Moreno. Their team-mate Menchov won the stage – 's fourth of the race – as he dropped Porte in the closing metres; six other members of the breakaway also crossed the line before the race contenders. Rodríguez was ninth on the stage, taking 25 seconds on Valverde – who was tenth – and he claimed back 44 seconds on Contador, who finished twelfth. In the general classification, Contador maintained his race lead, by a reduced margin of 1' 16\", over Valverde, with Rodríguez another 21 seconds in arrears.\nStage 21.\nThe Vuelta concluded with the now-customary stage finish in the centre of Madrid. The stage had an easy start – with a long and gradual descent from the start town of Cercedilla – before ten high-speed laps of a circuit, followed by the sprint finish. In keeping with tradition, the final stage began at a slow pace, and was a largely ceremonial procession on the run into Madrid. Shortly after the riders reached the circuit in the centre of the city, an intermediate sprint was held at the first passage through the line; David Moncoutié of and 's Grischa Niermann were allowed to pass through before the main field, as a gesture, ahead of their respective retirements from the professional peloton. After that, the main break was initiated by six riders on the opening lap of the Madrid circuit. The group – consisting of pairing Sergio Carrasco and Javier Chacón, 's Kevin Seeldraeyers, Javier Aramendia of , Mikel Astarloza () and Sergey Lagutin for – were never allowed to gain more than half a minute in their exploits and were eventually caught with around remaining.\nLagutin was the last to be caught, just as the peloton started their final lap. took up affairs on the front of the peloton, looking to get their sprinter Ben Swift a victory in the race but it was who set up their sprinter with the best run to the finish line. Having fended off the advances of Italian pairing Elia Viviani () and Daniele Bennati (), it was John Degenkolb that took his fifth stage victory of the race. Further behind, 's Alberto Contador finished within the peloton to take his second Vuelta overall title, while Simon Clarke () also confirmed his victory in the mountains classification. For the second year running, Joaquim Rodríguez () lost the victory in the points classification on the final day, as a sixth place stage finish for 's Alejandro Valverde allowed Valverde to overhaul Rodríguez's points tally by six. As a consequence of this, Valverde also claimed the combination classification on a tie-break, due to his second place overall finish to Rodríguez's third."

        "text": "The Heart of America Rugby Football Union is a college rugby conference playing in Division I-AA, with membership composed mostly of Big 12, Big Ten and SEC schools (and many of these schools enjoying longstanding rivalries from the former Big Eight Conference). HOA organizes a league competition with the winner qualifying for the national playoffs, and every fall hosts a rugby sevens tournament with the winner qualifying for the national sevens championships.\nHeart of America was a Division 2 conference until 2011, with Arkansas and Missouri ranked among the top teams in Division 2. In summer 2011, however, with the creation of the Premier College Division (Division I-A), several conferences including HOA decided to move up to Division I-AA.\nThe HOA conference is led by Conference Commissioner Bill Sexton of Truman State University.\nCurrent members.\nThe current member schools (and the date they joined the conference) are:\nMember notes:\nHeart of America Sevens.\nThe HOA sevens tournament is played every fall among the eight members of the HOA conference and a limited number of additional Division 1 schools. The winner of the HOA sevens tournament qualifies for the annual USA Rugby sevens national championship.\nThe HOA sevens tournament is one of a number of college rugby tournaments that are tapping into the increased interest of rugby sevens while also targeting traditional collegiate conference rivalries. The HOA developed this competition due to the increasing popularity of rugby sevens throughout the United States, particularly since the 2009 announcement adding rugby sevens to the Summer Olympics, and in the wake of the success of the Collegiate Rugby Championship rugby sevens tournament broadcast live on NBC every year."

        "text": "Brandon Brooks (born June 28, 1987) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA Development League.\nCollege.\nA native of Irving, Texas, Brooks attended Euless Trinity High School in Euless, Texas prior to enrolling at North Lake College as a freshman in 2005. He played junior college basketball for two seasons. In his first year, he played a supporting role as North Lake won the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Division III national championship. Although the team did not repeat as national champions in 2006–07, Brooks had a starting role as their point guard. He drew the attention of Alabama State University head coach Lewis Jackson, and after his junior college career ended Brooks headed to ASU to play for the Hornets.\nIn 2007–08, Brooks' junior year, he played in 31 games and averaged 9.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. On March 8, 2008, in a game against Jackson State, he recorded a school record 20 assists. This total is tied for the third-highest single game total in NCAA Division I men's basketball history. By winning the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC), they were able to participate in the 2008 NIT but would go on to lose in the first round. In his senior season in 2008–09, Brooks averaged 13.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game. He was named the SWAC Player of the Year after guiding the Hornets to a berth in the 2009 NCAA Tournament. They participated in the \"First Four\" but lost their play-in game. Aside from being the conference player of the year, Brooks was also honored as an Associated Press honorable mention All-American.\nProfessional.\nBrooks began his professional career after graduating from Alabama State in 2009. He spent his first season playing for Eisbären Bremerhaven in Germany's Basketball Bundesliga. He helped lead the team to the league's semifinals after playing in 44 games during the year, but he did not garner any personal accolades. Trying to get to the National Basketball Association (NBA), he then spent 2010–11 playing for the NBA Development League's Tulsa 66ers. The 66ers lost in the playoff semifinals as the Western Conference's fourth seed. After the year ended, Brooks headed back to Germany where he played for Phoenix Hagen. He signed with Israel's Hapoel Kfar Saba for the 2012–13 season before being released in December 2012. On March 23, 2013, the Tulsa 66ers acquired him for his second stint in Tulsa."

The competition began with a preliminary round on 7 August, where the number of competitors was reduced to 16, and concluded with a final on 13 August. As there were less than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers received a bye for the preliminary round. All bouts will consist of three periods where the boxers received points for every successful punch they land on their opponent's head or upper body. The boxer with the most points at the end of the bouts wins. If a boxer is knocked to the ground and cannot get up before the referee counts to 10 then the bout is over and the opponent wins."

        "text": "Disability golf classification is used for deaf golf, blind golf, amputee golf, golf for mentally disabled people, paraplegic golf and other forms of golf involving people with disabilities.\nClassifications.\nBlind golf.\nBlind golf is a version of the sport of golf adapted for blind and partially sighted players.\nHistory.\nThe earliest record of blind golf is from the 1920s in the United States: Clint Russell of Duluth, Minnesota, who lost his sight when a tire exploded in his face, began playing blind golf in 1925. Gradually increasing his scores, Clint managed to shoot an 84 for 18 holes in the early 1930s. A match between two blind Englishmen and two Americans took place before the Second World War.\nOrganized blind golf tournaments have taken place in America since the United States Blind Golf Association (USBGA) was established in 1947. The International Blind Golf Association (IBGA) was established in 1997 at a meeting held in Perth, Western Australia.\nThe American Blind Golf organization was established in 2001 to promote the game of golf to blind and vision impaired persons.\nClassification.\nThe Blind golf classification existed by 1990 and was used at the Australian Open Golf Tournament for the Blind and Visually Impaired. The four classifications were B1, B2, B3 and B4. Classifications in use at the time included B1, B2 and B3.\nB1 was defined as \"No light perception in either eye, up to some light perception but inability to recognize the shape of a hand at any distance or in any direction.\" \nB2 was defined as \"the ability to recognize the shape of a hand up to visual acuity of 2/60, or a visual field of less than 5 degrees.\" \nB3 was defined as \"visual acuity above 20/60, up to visual acuity of 6/60 and/or visual field of above 5 degrees and less than 20 degrees.\" \nB4 was defined as \"visual acuity of 6/60 up to visual acuity of 6/46.\"\nThe blind classifications are based on medical classification, not functional classification. The classification process for blind golf is governed by the International Blind Golf Association.\nPlaying blind golf.\nBlind golf is outstanding in the area of disabled sports in that it includes only minor modifications to the standard rules of golf. The principle of playing is that blind or partially sighted golf players have a sighted \"coach\" who assists the golfer in describing distance, direction and characteristics of the hole, and helps with club head alignment behind the ball, prior to the stroke. From that point, the golfer is on his own, and it is her/his skill that determines the resulting stroke.\nOther than the coach, there is only one relaxation to the standard rules: blind or partially sighted golfers are allowed to ground their club in a hazard.\nBlind golf competitions are set in classes determined by the golfer's level of sight (see above) using the same categories as in other branches of sports played by the visually impaired.\nThe Canadian Blind Golf Association was established in 1951. However, it has not been a functioning association since the mid-1980s. The Western Division and Ontario Visually Impaired Golf Association continued to operate independently and are currently making efforts to restructure the Canadian Association. The Canadian Association uses the same standards as the International Blind Sports Federation, with one exception: level of sight classification is based on acuity only, and not field of vision. The rationale is that golf is a dead ball sport and a player with \"tunnel vision\" can see the ball clearly when striking it.\nAmerican Blind Golf (ABG) was established in 2001. ABG partners with blind charities to raise money for blind services. ABG holds annual tournaments and fund raising events in San Antonio, Texas, Wadsworth Ohio and Lompoc California. The motto of ABG is \"inspire, motivate and serve all of those who deal with the loss of sight\".\nGovernance.\nThe International Blind Golf Association is an international association of blind golf playing countries. The sport is not played at the Paralympics.\nThe IBGA conducts a world championship every two years. The 2004 world championship tournament was held in Australia. Other tournaments sanctioned by the IBGA include National Open events in Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Japan and the United States. There are currently nine member countries in the IBGA: Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Northern Ireland, Scotland and the United States of America.\nParalympic Games.\nGolf has been submitted multiple times for inclusion in the programme of the Summer Paralympic Games, but bids for inclusion in the 2016 and 2024 Summer Paralympics did not come to fruition.\nOutstanding player achievements.\nIn October 2012 Andy Gardiner became the first amputee golfer to compete against able bodied golfers on a regular Professional Tour (Jamega Tour). Gardiner was the first disabled golfer to qualify through Q school and play on the PGA Europro Tour. Held #1 ranking through 2012-2014 (104 successive weeks). Gardiner scored his 11th Hole in One in July 2016 on 7th hole, Linden Hall Golf Club during Scotland V England international match play."

At the first time check after 11 km, the Orica–AIS sextet was less than a second behind Specialized–lululemon. Specialized–lululemon began to come to the fore and the team set a ferocious tempo up the climb of the Lange Raarberg, a little under two-thirds of the way into the race. At the second time check Specialized–lululemon coming through 13 seconds clear of the rivals. With Orica–AIS reduced to the minimum four for the finale, they remained in contention on the final climb of the Cauberg hill and crossed the line after the false flat 1:35 quicker than AA Drink–leontien.nl squad. Specialized–lululemon's Evelyn Stevens hit the front up the Cauberg hill with 20 seconds in hand and once over the top, Amber Neben, Trixi Worrack, Charlotte Becker and local favourite Ellen van Dijk took over for the final push to the line and brought Specialized–lululemon home to claim the first women's world team time trial victory."

Miandad played 124 Test matches and notched 8,832 runs to remain the leading scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. In 233 ODI matches, he scored 7,381 runs. In 1982, he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year; the cricket almanac tagged him as \"one of the best and most exciting players in the world\". He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in January 2009.\nMiandad scored century on his Test debut against New Zealand at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, in 1976. He was only the second Pakistan player to achieve this feat. In the third and final Test of the series at National Stadium, Karachi, he made 206 runs and, at 19 years and 141 days, became the youngest ever player to complete a double hundred. Seven years later, in 1983, Miandad realized his highest Test score, an unbeaten 280, against India at the Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad.\nIn Test cricket, Miandad made a double century on six occasions. He also scored a century in his 100th Test match and is only the second player to do so in the annals of the game. Miandad scored Test hundreds at thirteen cricket grounds, including nine at venues outside Pakistan. Four of his Test centuries came while captaining his team. As of August 2012, he was twenty-first in the overall list of most hundreds in a Test career.\nHaving made his ODI debut in 1975 against the West Indies at Edgbaston, Birmingham, Miandad scored his first ODI century against India at Municipal Stadium, Gujranwala, in 1982. His highest ODI score of 119 not out came in a match which Pakistan lost to India at the Gaddafi Stadium, on 31 December 1982. As of August 2012, he was thirtieth overall among all-time combined century makers, a position he shares with Saeed Anwar and Aravinda de Silva."

In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play.\nUSA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\nPreseason polls.\nVarious publications and news sources release their preseason top 25 months before the season commences."

        "title": "2013 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2013 Major League Baseball season started on March 31 with a Sunday night game between the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros. Opening Day for most clubs was a day later on April 1. The regular season ended on September 30, extended one day for a one-game playoff between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Texas Rangers to decide the second American League Wild Card winner.\nThe 2013 season was the first with the Houston Astros as a member of the American League (AL), playing in the West Division. This marked the first growth in the number of American League teams since the 1977 Major League Baseball expansion added the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays. When the then-named Tampa Bay Devil Rays were added to the AL in 1998, the Milwaukee Brewers were reassigned to the National League (NL) the same year, keeping the AL at 14 teams. With the Astros' move to the AL, giving both leagues 15 teams, interleague play occurred throughout the entire season for the first time in MLB history.\nThe Major League Baseball All-Star Game's 84th edition was held on July 16 at Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, with the AL defeating the NL, 3–0. With the win, home field advantage at the World Series was awarded to the AL.\nThe season ended with the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series at Fenway Park for the first time since 1918, defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in six games. The Red Sox's victory recovered the city of Boston six months after the marathon bombing. This marked the last time a team clinched the World Series on their home field until 2022, where the Houston Astros won their second championship at Minute Maid Park.\nRule changes.\nSeveral minor rule changes took effect during the 2013 season. These changes were approved by MLB owners; unless otherwise noted, they will also need the approval of the players' union.\nManagerial changes.\nField managers.\nOff-season.\nAt the end of the 2012 season, the following teams made replacements to their managers.\nScheduling changes.\nThe Houston Astros' move to the American League West created two 15-team leagues each separated into three five-team divisions. With an odd number of teams in each league, interleague games were played nearly every day during the season, the only exception being when not every team had a game. For this season, each team played 20 interleague games (up from 15–18 games in 2012) in eight series. Each team played one three-game series against four teams from one division in the other league, and two two-game series (one home, one away) against the remaining team in that division (for 2013 the match-ups are AL East vs. NL West, AL Central vs. NL East, and AL West vs. NL Central, meaning the changes of the Astros and the small increase in interleague play will not affect the yearly rotation, also the Astros played all their former NL Central rivals in 2013). The remaining four games were played against a team's \"natural rival\" in two back-to-back two-game series from May 27–30. Teams played in one city May 27 and 28, then traveled to the other city for games on May 29 and 30. It was the first season that every team has an interleague rivalry, according to the table below, with new rivalries for the season shown in italics.\nThe remaining 142 games will be played within the league. Each team will play its four division rivals 19 times (up from 15–18 in 2012) for a total of 76 games. Each team will play either 6 or 7 games against the ten teams in the two other divisions in its league, for a total of 66 games. In 2012, these season series ranged anywhere from five to ten games, creating large disparities between teams' strengths of schedule.\nAside from the natural rivalries, teams from the same division will play the same opponents for roughly the same number of games. The only variation occurs in interleague match-ups (either 3 or 4 games) and same-league interdivision match-ups (either 6 or 7 games).\nUniforms.\nWholesale changes.\nAll 30 teams are wearing new batting practice caps. The new caps provided by the New Era Cap Company are of the 59Fifty style instead of the 39Fifty used in seasons past. In addition to batting practice and spring training games, Major League Baseball has also allowed the use of the new caps during regular season play.\nThe Houston Astros unveiled a new/old identity at a fan event November 2, 2012, at Minute Maid Park, as the team reverted to the orange and navy colors used from their inception in 1962 through 1993. There are four uniforms and three hats. Houston will wear white uniforms with orange piping at home, and gray ones with blue piping on the road. There's an orange alternate jersey with blue piping that can be worn at home or on the road, as well as a blue jersey to be worn for Sunday games.\nOn November 14, the New York Mets introduced two new blue alternate jerseys. The home alternate features the \"Mets\" script, player numerals and names in orange outlined in white, while the road alternate features the \"NEW YORK\" script, player numerals and names in gray outlined in orange. The team also introduced a new alternate cap with a blue crown and an orange brim, with an orange \"NY\" logo outlined in white.\nOn November 19, the St. Louis Cardinals introduced an alternate uniform to be worn for Saturday home games. The uniform is off-white and the jersey features the \"St. Louis\" script on the front. This is the first time in 80 years the city name appears in the team's uniforms.\nOn December 14, the Pittsburgh Pirates introduced an alternate uniform to be worn for Sunday home games. It is the same uniform that the team wore from mid-1970 through 1976 and was worn during their championship season of 1971. The hat that goes with this uniform is mustard gold with a black bill.\nOn January 24, 2013, the Chicago White Sox announced they will be wearing 1983 throwback uniforms on Sunday home games to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their 1983 division title. The uniforms replaced the 1972 red pinstriped throwbacks from last season.\nOn January 24, the Milwaukee Brewers promoted their special edition 'gold-out' uniforms to alternate status. The uniforms were first used on September 10, 2011, against the Phillies, but did not wear them the previous season. The Brewers have also worn a Latin Nights version of the gold uniform (with 'Cerveceros' wordmark) the last two seasons, and would wear them again on June 8 against the Phillies. They also wore a fan-designed uniform for two spring training games, featuring an updated version of the Beer Barrel Man logo in the current colors, and classic typeface design, designed by Ben Peters of Richfield, Minnesota.\nThrowbacks.\nAs part of the franchise's 20th anniversary, the Colorado Rockies wore their original grey away uniforms at Coors Field on April 16 against the Mets. The uniforms, complete with the inaugural season patch, team name and purple piping, were the uniforms the Rockies used in their inaugural 1993 season. Though it was a home game, they wore the grey throwbacks to correspond to the franchise's first game at Shea Stadium. The Mets wore corresponding throwback white pinstripe uniforms with an underscore below the word 'Mets'.\nThe Detroit Tigers donned Detroit Stars throwbacks for Negro leagues tribute night against the Atlanta Braves on April 27. The Braves wore Atlanta Black Crackers throwbacks.\nThe Brewers wore the 1913 American Association throwbacks on May 5 against the Cardinals, who wore corresponding throwbacks.\nThe San Diego Padres wore their orange, gold and brown home throwbacks from the 1984 season against the Washington Nationals on May 17. On June 14, they wore their 1998 navy alternates against the Arizona Diamondbacks. On July 12, they wore throwbacks of the 1948 Padres of the Pacific Coast League against the Giants.\nThe Minnesota Twins wore the 1948 St. Paul Saints uniforms on May 30 against the Brewers. Even though the game was held at Target Field, the Twins wore the road grey versions of the throwbacks, while the Brewers will wore the home whites.\nFour teams – the Pirates, the Reds, the Nationals and the Braves – wore Negro leagues throwbacks on June 1. The Pirates wore the Homestead Grays uniforms, while the Reds wore the Cincinnati Tigers uniforms. The Nationals and Braves wore Negro leagues throwbacks that day as well, the Nationals wearing Grays uniforms, and the Braves donning Black Crackers uniforms. (The Grays called Pittsburgh and Washington home.) On July 20, the Brewers wore the Negro league Milwaukee Bears uniforms against the Marlins, who wore the uniforms of the International League Marlins. The Nationals again represented the Grays on August 24 against the Royals, who wore Kansas City Monarchs uniforms.\nThe Seattle Mariners wore the 1909 Seattle Turks uniforms for their interleague matchup with the Chicago Cubs on June 29. The Cubs wore their 1909 throwbacks, as well.\nThe Kansas City Royals wore their 1985 powder blue pullover uniforms on June 9 against the Astros.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays wore their faux-back 1970s uniforms on July 6 against the White Sox, who wore the previous season's Sunday home throwback jerseys from the 1972 season.\nThe Cleveland Indians wore the 1902 Cleveland Bronchos uniforms on July 13, in a non-televised game against the Royals. Despite the game taking place at Progressive Field, the Indians wore the road version of the Bronchos uniforms (navy jersey, cap, and pants, with black socks).\nThe White Sox, in celebration of their 1983 AL West champion team, donned 1983-replica jerseys during each Sunday home game, as well as other select occasions.\nThe Angels and Athletics wore 1969 throwbacks on July 27. The Angels then wore a hybridized version of their 1980s throwbacks (with buttons, belts and California patch on the left sleeve) on August 16, and then their 1961–65 throwbacks the following day against the Astros. The 1961–65 throwbacks were worn again on September 5 against the Rays to pay tribute to Bobby Knoop's induction to the Angels Hall of Fame.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies wore their 1991 home pinstripe throwbacks on August 23 against the Diamondbacks, who wore their 1999 black alternate throwbacks. The Diamondbacks also wore the said throwback uniforms on August 31 against the Giants.\nOther uniforms.\nThe San Francisco Giants wore special uniforms to commemorate their 2012 World Series win on April 7. Similar to their commemoration of their 2010 World Series championship, the jerseys, instead of bearing the familiar \"GIANTS\" across the chest, displayed the interlocking \"SF\" logo on the front of the jersey's left side in gold. The Giants also wore caps with the \"SF\" logo also in gold.\nOn April 20 and 21, the Boston Red Sox wore home uniforms with \"BOSTON\" on the front of the jerseys instead of the familiar \"RED SOX\" to honor the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.\nCinco de Mayo saw two teams don Hispanic-flavored uniforms. The Giants wore their cream home uniforms with 'Gigantes' in front against the Dodgers, while the Houston Astros wore their current home uniforms with 'Los Astros' in front against the Detroit Tigers. The Cincinnati Reds wore red jerseys with 'Los Rojos' in front for their May 11 game against Milwaukee. The Giants again wore the 'Gigantes' uniforms against the Diamondbacks on September 7. On the same day, the Seattle Mariners wore a modified version of their white uniforms against the Rays, featuring 'Marineros' in front.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates wore desert camouflage uniforms for their games against the Astros May 17 and 18.\nAll teams wore uniforms with camouflaged logos, names and numerals on May 27, Memorial Day in the United States.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers wore special batting practice uniforms against the Braves on June 23 for Polish Heritage Day. The uniform is white with red striping, featuring \"Piwowarzy\" in front. They also wore red fielding caps.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays wore red jerseys against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Canada Day in Canada.\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks wore special black uniforms during their homestand from July 5–14 to commemorate the 19 firefighters who perished in the Yarnell Hill Fire. The style was similar to their alternate black uniforms, except the front read 'Arizona' in brick red, and had black and sand trim.\nAll teams wore special caps with an American (or Canadian) flag on July 4. The Reds, whose game was rained out that day, wore the caps on July 5 against Seattle.\nThe New York Mets wore a special orange 'Los Mets' jersey on July 24 against Atlanta.\nThe Tigers wore a Hispanic-flavored home uniform against the White Sox on August 3 as part of the 'Fiesta Tigres' promotion. The uniform is similar in style to the 1960 script uniforms, but read 'Tigres' in front.\nThe Washington Nationals wore US Navy caps on September 17 during pre-game before the first game of a doubleheader against Atlanta to commemorate the victims of the Washington Navy Yard shooting. The first game was a makeup game for the one scheduled for September 16 which was postponed due to the shooting.\nPatches.\nAnniversaries and special events.\nThe following teams wore commemorative patches for special occasions:\nTelevision.\nNational.\nThis was the seventh and final year of the current TV contracts with ESPN, Fox Sports and TBS, before the new eight-year TV contracts begin in 2014.

        "title": "Ice hockey in Australia",
        "text": "Ice hockey in Australia is a sport which had a relatively poor popularity, having low participation and spectator attendance figures when compared with many other sports played in the country.\nHowever, the establishment of the semi-professional Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL) in 2000 (in place of the collapsed former state-based national competition) has seen an increase in popularity for the sport, a trend which continued in 2012 with the successful expansion of the league into Western Australia with the inclusion of Perth-based side Perth Thunder and the introduction of a two-conference competition.\nThe AIHL is the top-level ice hockey league in Australia, and the largest league in the Southern Hemisphere. The Australian Women's Ice Hockey League (AWIHL) is the top-level women's competition and was formed in 2005.\nIce hockey in Australia is governed nationally by the Australian Ice Hockey Federation (currently trading as \"Ice Hockey Australia\"), formed in 1923 as the Australian Ice Hockey Association. Australia is an active full-member of the International Ice Hockey Federation having been admitted to the federation in 1938.\nAs of 2012 there were approximately 3,200 registered ice hockey players in Australia.\nHistory.\nIce Polo: Before Ice Hockey.\nThe beginnings of ice sports in Australia are traced back to the evening of 12 October 1904, during a carnival held at the Adelaide Glaciarium, the first ice rink built in Australia.\nThis important location for Australian ice sports began as a Cyclorama, which opened on 28 November 1890, at 89 Hindley Street, Adelaide. On the evening of 6 September 1904, the building was reopened after being remodeled by a new group called the Ice Palace Skating Company, owned by H. Newman Reid and referred to as the Glaciarium or Ice Palace Skating Rink.\nOn the evening of 12 October 1904, a match for what was called \"hockey on the ice\" was held during the carnival at the Adelaide Glaciarium. This game was not ice hockey, it was an adaption of roller polo to the ice using ice skates instead of roller skates.\nAt the time this version of roller polo adapted to the ice was being played in Adelaide, ice hockey was already a well established sport and had been codified for almost 30 years. Though it was being called \"hockey on the ice\", it was not ice hockey.\nThe first ice hockey match.\nThe beginnings of ice sports in Australia can be linked to the Glaciarium in Adelaide but the birthplace of ice hockey in Australia was in Melbourne, Victoria, and was the first time ice hockey had been played. Organised games of ice hockey in Australia began with the opening of the Melbourne Glaciarium on the afternoon of 9 June 1906, at 16 City Road, South Melbourne Victoria.\nThe first recorded organised game of ice hockey in Australia was on 17 July 1906, and was between a Victorian representative team and the American sailors from the visiting American Warship the USS \"Baltimore\". This game was held in the Melbourne Glaciarium, the Australian team were dressed in all white and the team from USS \"Baltimore\" wore white shirts with a large upper case black B on the front and center of the chest and grey trousers. The skill level of the Australians was not seen to be up to the level of the Americans but the game was hard fought and result of the game was a 1–1 tie.\nIn 1909 state teams from Victoria and New South Wales first contested the Goodall Cup, which has since served continuously as the trophy awarded to the winners of the annual national competition (with hiatuses for the two World Wars, the closure of the Sydney Glaciarium in the late 1950s and for a single year in 1993), thus making the Goodall Cup the third-oldest still awarded ice hockey trophy in the world, and the oldest outside of Canada.\nOrganisation.\nIce Hockey Australia has seven state and territory-based affiliate associations across Australia which are in turn responsible for the organisation of the sport at the state and territory level.\nInternational competition.\nAustralia's performance in international competition has been ordinary, qualifying for the Winter Olympic Games only once in 1960. As of 2012 the men's national team is ranked 32nd in the International Ice Hockey Federation's rankings; the women's national team is ranked 24th. 2012 saw the inaugural Trans-Tasman Champions League games between the previous season's two top-ranked sides from both the Australian Ice Hockey League and the New Zealand Ice Hockey League.\nAustralian Ice Hockey League.\nThe Australian Ice Hockey League was formed in 2000. From 2000-2001 the Sydney Bears, Adelaide Avalanche and Canberra Knights played round robins. Avalanche won the 2000 and 2001 AIHL Cup.\nIn 2002 the addition of Melbourne Ice, West Sydney Ice Dogs and the Newcastle North Stars made the league more purposeful.\nThe Bears won in 2002, the North Stars in 2003 and the Ice Dogs in 2004 with the introduction of a new finals method. The top four would play in sudden death semi-finals and then the two winners would play for the AIHL Championship. This has remained unchanged.\n2005 saw the introduction of two new teams: The Central Coast Rhinos and the Brisbane Bluetongues. The North Stars took the cup in 2005.\nIn 2008 Adelaide Avalanche changed to the Adelaide Adrenaline because of managing purposes. Newcastle won 2006, the Bears in 2007 and the Stars again in 2008.\n2009 saw the Bluetingues changing to the Gold Coast Blue Tongues and the Rhinos withdrawing the competition because of AIHL's licensing changes. 2009's cup was taken by the Adrenaline and 2010 was taken by the Ice in Melbourne's new Olympic Training Facility in Melbourne's Docklands.\nIn 2011 the Mustangs Ice Hockey Club joined the league making it an eight teamed competition. Their home rink is also at the Docklands.\nThe Perth Thunder joined the AIHL at the start of 2012 as the ninth team."

After graduation, he went on to play club rugby for Northcote in North Harbour's club rugby competition.\nSenior career.\nHall broke into the North Harbour team during the 2012 ITM Cup while aged just 20. He played 9 times for the men from Auckland's North Shore and scored 35 points which included 3 tries as they finished bottom the Championship log with just 1 win in 10 games. 2013 saw him establish himself as the province's first choice halfback, playing in all 10 of their games during the season as they once again finished in last place.\n2014 saw some improvement from Harbour as they finished 5th out of 7 teams in the ITM Cup Championship and Hall continued to be first pick in the number 9 jersey, playing 9 times. He was named as team captain and was an ever present in 2015 as Harbour once again finished in 5th place, just outside the promotion play-off places.\nThe arrival of veteran halfback, Chris Smylie for the 2016 season provided Hall will some stiff competition for a starting place for the first time in several years, however, he rose to the challenge, playing in all 12 of Harbour's matches, starting 8 times as they earned promotion to the Mitre 10 Cup Premiership for 2017 with an upset victory away to in the Championship final.\nSuper Rugby.\nStrong performances in an under-performing North Harbour side in 2012 brought him to the attention of local Super Rugby franchise, the who named him in their squad for the 2013 Super Rugby season. He made his Super Rugby debut in Round 2 of the season, coming on as a 63rd minute replacement in the 34–15 win over the Crusaders at Eden Park, however that would turn out to be his only appearance for the year as a broken jaw and glandular fever ensured that he found himself third in the pecking order for the halfback jersey behind All Black Piri Weepu and 's Jamison Gibson-Park.\nIn 2014, he earned a lot more game time and had nailed down the starting halfback spot for the Blues by the end of the season, dislodging the far more experienced Weepu. However, all the momentum he'd built up through 2014 was lost when a broken foot picked up playing club rugby forced him to miss the entire 2015 campaign, but, fully fit in 2016, new head-coach Tana Umaga made him the franchise's first choice number 9 once more and he went on to play in all 15 of their matches during a slightly disappointing season which ended with them in 11th place in the overall standings.\nIn June 2016, it was announced that Hall would move south to join the Christchurch-based Crusaders for 2017 where he would compete with former New Zealand under-20 international Mitchell Drummond for a starting berth in the wake of the departure of the experienced Andy Ellis.\nInternational.\nHall was a New Zealand Schools representative in 2010 and then along with future Blues team-mate Steve Luatua, went on to co-captain the New Zealand Under-20 side which finished as runner-up in the 2012 IRB Junior World Championship in South Africa.\nCareer honours.\nNorth Harbour\nControversy.\nHall while on Sky Sports show \"Kick off\" referred to fellow Crusader teammate Jack Goodhue as \"a Jew\" for attempting to get a women's magazine to pay for his wedding. These comments were labelled as \"casual racism\" by the BSA but the slur was not serious enough to warrant a breach of broadcasting standards"

Likewise, long-time PBA Tour professional Butch Soper captured his first career major at the PBA National Championship.\nDave Husted became the first PBA player to win three modern-day BPAA U.S. Open titles, and the first to win back-to-back as he successfully defended his 1995 U.S. Open crown.\nThough shut out in the major tournaments, Walter Ray Williams, Jr. collected five titles on the season and led the tour in earnings, helping him win PBA Player of the Year honors for the third time in his career.\nAt the Columbia 300 Open, C.K. Moore rolled the PBA's ninth televised 300 game, becoming the first Tour rookie to do so. Later in the season, at the Flagship Open, Bob Learn, Jr. rolled the PBA's 10th televised perfect game in his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. At this same event, Learn shattered the PBA record for a four-game TV series by downing 1,129 pins. The old record was set in 1995 by David Ozio, who toppled 1,070 pins."

The team's head coach was Kevin Stallings, in his fourteenth season at Vanderbilt. The team plays their home games at Memorial Gymnasium in Nashville, Tennessee, as a member of the Southeastern Conference.\nPrevious season.\nAfter a 21–10 regular season that fell short of lofty preseason expectations, the Commodores captured their first SEC tournament championship in 61 seasons on March 11, 2012, by defeating top-ranked Kentucky in the SEC Tournament finals. The Commodores advanced to their third consecutive NCAA tournament where they defeated Harvard in the second round before falling the third round to Wisconsin to finish the season 25–11.\nDepartures.\nVanderbilt suffered devastating personnel losses after the 2011–12 season; of their six leading scorers, five graduated and the other declared for the 2012 NBA draft. In all, the Commodores lost 88.1% of their scoring from 2011 to 2012. Also, the Commodores' returning players had started a total of three games in the 2011–12 season. Of the 14 SEC teams in the 2012–13 season, Vanderbilt was one of only three that did not return a player who averaged double figures in points in the previous season, and the only team that returned fewer starts was Kentucky, which did not return a single player who had started a game in 2011–12.\nIn addition, for the second straight offseason, a Vanderbilt assistant accepted a Division I head coaching position. In the 2011 offseason, King Rice left to become the head coach at Monmouth. This offseason, Dan Muller returned to his alma mater of Illinois State. Stallings chose not to hire a new assistant. Previously, he had rotated the administrative role of director of basketball operations among his assistants. This season, he named former Commodores player Dan Cage as director of basketball operations and removed that role from his assistants.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12| Exhibition\n!colspan=12| Non-Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12| SEC Regular Season\n!colspan=12| 2013 SEC tournament"

        "text": "The Ireland women's national field hockey team is organised by Hockey Ireland and represents both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in international women's field hockey competitions, including the Women's Hockey World Cup and the Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship. They have previously competed in the Women's Intercontinental Cup, the Women's Hockey Champions Challenge, Women's FIH Hockey World League and the Women's FIH Hockey Series. The team also competes at the Summer Olympics, though it officially only represents the Republic of Ireland then (using the Republic's flag and national anthem), while still selecting players from the entire island.\nOn 2 March 1896, Ireland played England in the first ever women's international field hockey match. Ireland were finalists and silver medallists at the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup and competed at the 2020 Olympic tournament.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Irish Ladies Hockey Union was established in 1894. On 2 March 1896 they organised and hosted the first ever women's international field hockey match when Ireland defeated England 2–0 at Alexandra College.\nTournament record.\nOlympics.\nIreland have qualified for the 2020 summer olympics Olympic Games. They were invited to enter the inaugural 1980 tournament but did not participate because of the boycott. Between 1991 and 2012 Ireland competed in Olympic qualifiers. In 2012 they reached the final of a qualifying tournament but lost 4–1 to Belgium. Ireland attempted to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics via the 2014–15 Women's FIH Hockey World League. However they failed to qualify after losing out to China in a penalty shoot-out during a tournament in Valencia.\nWorld Cup.\nIreland have played in five Women's Hockey World Cups, making their debut in 1986. Ireland qualified for their first tournament after winning the 1983 Women's Intercontinental Cup. Ireland hosted the 1994 Women's Hockey World Cup and made their third appearance in 2002 after finishing fifth in the 2001 Women's Intercontinental Cup.\nIreland were finalists and silver medallists at the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup. Deirdre Duke scored twice against the United States as Ireland won their opening pool stage game 3–1. Shirley McCay was also on target for Ireland. In their second pool game against India, Anna O'Flanagan's goal secured a 1–0 win for Ireland and a place in the quarter-finals. Ireland lost their third pool game against England. However, after winning their first two games, they had already qualified for the knockout stages. The quarter-final against India finished 0–0 but Roisin Upton, Alison Meeke and Chloe Watkins were all on target as Ireland won the penalty shoot-out 3–1. Ireland coach Graham Shaw hailed Ayeisha McFerran's performance in the penalty shoot-out after she saved three out of the four India penalty strokes. In the semi-final against Spain, O'Flanagan scored her second goal before Spain equalised and the game finished 1–1. In the subsequent penalty shoot-out, Ireland won 3–2, with Gillian Pinder scoring twice and McFerran again saving three penalty strokes. Despite losing the final 6–0 to the Netherlands, Ireland were acclaimed for their overall performance in the tournament. They had begun the tournament as underdogs, the second lowest seed. They were ranked 15th out of sixteen teams taking part. Their team was made up of part-timers and amateurs while in the final they played a team of full-time professionals. It was reported in \"The Irish Times\" that the players had to pay €550 to compete. Although this claim was subsequently denied by both Sport Ireland and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross. Following their appearance in the World Cup final, Ireland moved up to a best ever eighth position in the FIH World Rankings. Their previous highest ranking position was 14th.\nEuroHockey Championships.\nIreland competed in every Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship between 1984 and 2013. However, after finishing 7th in 2013, they were relegated to the second level, Women's EuroHockey Championship II. Ireland subsequently returned to the top level after winning the 2015 Women's EuroHockey Championship II, defeating the Czech Republic 5–0 in the final.\nWomen's Intercontinental Cup.\nBetween 1983 and 2006 Ireland played regularly in the Women's Intercontinental Cup. Ireland qualified for the 1986 Women's Hockey World Cup after winning the 1983 Women's Intercontinental Cup. The team was captained by Margaret Gleghorne and also included Mary Geaney. Ireland qualified for the 2002 Women's Hockey World Cup after finishing 5th in the 2001 Women's Intercontinental Cup in controversial circumstances. Ireland played Lithuania in a fifth to eighth place classification match. The match finished 2–2 and Lithuania won the subsequent penalty shoot-out 6–5. However Ireland captain, Rachel Kohler, spotted that the penalty strokes were being taken in the wrong order. She was initially ignored by the match officials, but Ireland appealed and the tournament director ruled the shoot-out should be replayed the next day. However Lithuania refused to take part and withdrew from the tournament. Ireland went on to defeat Scotland 2–1 in the fifth place play-off and were initially confirmed as the final qualifier from the tournament. Before the match the Lithuania team staged a sit down protest on the pitch. Lithuania lodged a further appeal to the FIH who then ordered that Ireland, Lithuania, India and the United States take part in a second qualification tournament. Lithuania were due to play India in a seventh and eighth place play-off before they withdrew. The United States had been unable to participate in the original tournament due to the disruption of airline schedules after the September 11 attacks. However Ireland in turn appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport who overruled the FIH decision and finally confirmed Ireland's place in the 2002 Women's Hockey World Cup.\nWomen's Hockey Champions Challenge.\nBetween 2009 and 2014 Ireland enter teams in Women's Hockey Champions Challenge tournaments.\nWomen's FIH Hockey World League.\nBetween 2012 and 2017 Ireland competed in the Women's FIH Hockey World League. In March 2015 they won a Round 2 tournament hosted in Dublin, defeating Canada in the final after a penalty shoot-out. Ireland attempted to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics via the 2014–15 Women's FIH Hockey World League. However they failed to qualify after losing out to China in a penalty shoot-out during the Semi-finals tournament in Valencia. In January 2017 they won a Round 2 tournament in Kuala Lumpur, defeating Malaysia 3–0 in the final with goals from Anna O'Flanagan, Katie Mullan and Zoe Wilson. Ireland's seventh-place finish at the 2016–17 Women's FIH Hockey World League Semi-finals eventually saw them qualify for the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup.\nWomen's FIH Hockey Series.\nDuring 2019, Ireland played in the Women's FIH Series.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nSquad for the 2022 Women's FIH Hockey World Cup.\nHead coach: Sean Dancer\nOlympians.\nThe following Ireland internationals have also represented Great Britain at the Summer Olympics.\nIreland field hockey internationals, Thelma Hopkins and Maeve Kyle, have also represented Great Britain and Ireland, respectively, at the Olympics.

        "text": "Richard Davison (born 20 September 1955) is an Olympic standard dressage rider.\nDavison is a four-time Olympian having represented Great Britain at the Olympic Games in London in 2012, Athens in 2004, Sydney in 2000 and Atlanta in 1996. He was the British Team captain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nHe is a World and European Championship team medallist. He remains one of Britain's most successful dressage competitors, having competed over four decades. He has made an extensive contribution to the sport during his career, not only as a rider, but also as a trainer and team manager. His knowledge and experience has helped steer dressage from being barely known among the general public to becoming the sport of the 'dancing horses' that Britain celebrated during London.\nIn 2022 he won team silver at the FEI World Championships on Bubblingh, a horse owned by Gwendolyn Sontheim and which he had bred out of a mare which he had also competed for her at the 2002 World Championships and on whom he had won team bronze at the 2003 European Championships.\nHe is the former British Dressage World Class Equestrian Programme Performance Manager and British Olympic Dressage Team Captain, and for many years was a coach to the British World Class Show Jumping Programme. He has been credited for 'masterminding the strategic plan behind Britain's most successful period of International successes' which resulted in the Dressage team's historic Olympic and European team gold medals and World Championship medals.\nHe has acted as a Board Member and moderator for The Global Dressage Forum at each event since its inception in 2001. The event provides a live forum for the global dressage community and has HRH Princess Benedikte of Denmark as its President.\nDavison has been described as an eloquent and skilled moderator who is practised at combining firm control with humour when needed, and who keeps meetings on message and delegates engaged.\nThe six time Olympic medallist Carl Hester MBE describes Davison as 'A long-time friend, teammate and advisor' and like others credits him for 'masterminding the strategic plan behind Britain's most successful period of international success'.\nFrom 1995 until 2003 Davison was a member of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) Dressage Committee. In 2008 when the FEI President HRH Princess Haya Bint Hussein demanded that the entire committee should resign, on the grounds it did not fully represent the interests of the dressage community, Davison was appointed by the FEI Executive Board to the Ad Hoc Task Force which was established to replace the committee and to inject a new focus in the sport.\nHe was also a member of the FEI Dressage Judging Working Group established in 2015 to review International judging scoring systems and to make recommendations for improvement. The Working Group made nineteen recommendations when they presented their final report in 2018. One of Davison's roles was to seek input from a cohort of behavioural psychologists and visual cognition experts from Nottingham Trent University to evaluate and ease cognitive load involved in judging.\nIn 2010 he was also a member of the FEI Working Group tasked with expanding current guidelines for Stewards to facilitate clear implementation of the policy on warm-up techniques at FEI events. Among other things this was established to give stewards greater powers to sanction aggressive riding techniques.\nHe has acted as an expert witness in high profile legal claims, and he is a member of the organising committee of the London International Horse Show and acts as technical advisor to a number of other competitions. He was a member of the founding group of the Burghley Young Event Horse series.\nDavison has competed horses for high profile owners including Lord and Lady Bamford, HRH Princess Haya bint Hussein, Gwendolyn Sontheim and the Countess of Derby. In 2015, together with his younger son Joe, he was asked to present a dressage masterclass demonstrating his training methods to HM Queen Elizabeth II using Hiscox Artemis, the horse Davison rode for Lady Derby at the 2012 London Olympic Games.\nThe Countess of Derby arranged for Sir Elton John and Robbie Williams to give permission for Davison to ride to their music in his dressage freestyle programmes. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra recorded the compositions and the project was supported in part by The Foundation for Sport and the Arts.\nDavison spent the early years of his career training and studying dressage in Vienna as a pupil of Arthur Kottas-Heldenberg, and also at the famous Spanish Riding School, considered to be the home of classical dressage, where he also had the honour of being accepted as a student.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Davison joined other equestrian personalities in Equestrian Relief, a fund raising initiative in support of NHS workers.\nEquine Welfare and Ethical Training.\nDavison champions the underpinning of equine training methods, together with the regulation of equestrian sport, with the use of science-based evidence.\nHe is a Trustee of World Horse Welfare.\nHe has been invited to present at a number of equine science meetings including those run by The Saddlery Research Trust, the British Horse Society, Liverpool University, The Reaseheath College, BEVA, and has co-chaired events for the International Society for Equestrian Science.\nMedia Work.\nOver the years Davison has contributed regularly to a number of equestrian publications, and acted as a guest editor of Horse and Hound magazine with whom he was a long-time columnist. He has regularly commentated on TV. He has made a number of dressage training DVD's. He authored the book Dressage Priority Points published in 1996 and wrote the foreword to Brain, Pain or Training.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, together with Carl Hester MBE, he hosted The Dressage Convention. The duo used the weekend-long event to attempt to dispel the mysteries surrounding dressage training and make it fun and inclusive. In an effort to unite the classical dressage community with their own competition worlds they invited Sylvia Loch of The Classical Riding Club to join them.\nMore recently the duo of Hester and Davison have co-hosted Dressage Unwrapped at the London International Horse Show together with other International dressage celebrities.\nHorse and Country television have featured Davison in a number of masterclasses and series including 'Daisy Dines With', a cooking and dining series hosted by Daisy Bunn where, alongside fellow Olympian Geoff Billington, he was a guest of Nina Barbour. Alice Plunket also featured Davison and his family in her series 'In the Frame'.\nTo the Reuters news agency in 2016 Davison described the world record holding champion dressage horse Valegro as the 'Muhammad Ali' of dressage, the greatest. He reiterated this at Valegro's official retirement ceremony at the London International Horse Show but went on to credit the influence of Valegro's rider Charlotte Dujardin and trainer Carl Hester by saying 'In my time in the sport - which is 40 years - I've never seen a horse like Valegro. Frankly he is the greatest, he is the Muhammad Ali of this sport. But he also needs a fantastic rider, and I think it is the alchemy between those three (Valegro, Charlotte Dujardin and Carl Hester), that has given us the privilege of watching the greatest combination together'.\nHonours and awards.\nRichard Davison is a former visiting fellow at Nottingham Trent University. In 2017 the university awarded him an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science in recognition of his significant contribution to the world of equestrian sport.\nHe was awarded the Horse and Hound magazine 1996 Dressage Personality of the Year Award.\nIn 2009 he received the Horse of the Year Show Equestrian of the Year Award.\nHe was awarded the British Equestrian Federation Medal of Honour in recognition of activities connected with International endeavour.\nHe is a Fellow of the British Horse Society and a Fellow of the International Dressage Trainer Club.\nDavison is holder of the FEI Gold Badge of Honour.\nSince 1992 Davison's family have awarded the 'GW Davison Award' to British Dressage riders who perform with excellence when competing as part of the British team at a European or World Championships or Olympic Games. The award is intended to nurture and commend team spirit while competing at the highest levels.\nPersonal life.\nDavison is married to fellow equestrian Gillian, and they have two sons. Their eldest son Tom is an international equestrian coach based in the USA and the EU. Their youngest son Joe is an International show jumper. Horse and Hound magazine featured his Staffordshire home asking, 'is this the most idyllic dressage yard in Britain?'"

        "text": "The Badminton Cabinet is a monumental piece of 18th-century furniture that twice set the record for most expensive piece of furniture ever sold.\nThe Badminton Cabinet, or Badminton Chest, was commissioned in 1726 by Henry Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort, at the age of 19. It took thirty experts six years to make, and came to be named after the Duke's country seat, Badminton House in Gloucestershire, England, where it remained until it was auctioned by his descendants in the late 20th century.\nThe ebony cabinet is tall and wide and shows scenes rendered in pietra dura—inlaid finely cut, polished and coloured stones, including in this case a number of semi-precious stones. The clock face set at the top of the cabinet is marked with fleurs-de-lis, flanked by two gilded statues, and surmounted with a coat of arms. Below that is a parapet set with pietra dura lozenges. Three horizontal sections with inlaid drawers surround a central cupboard. The cabinet rests on eight inlaid pilasters.\nThe Badminton Cabinet became the highest-priced piece of furniture in the world when it was auctioned for £8.58m million in 1990. It again set the record when it was auctioned in December 2004, this time for £19 million."

        "title": "Blanchard's cricket frog",
        "text": "Blanchard's cricket frog (Acris blanchardi) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is a small, dark colored frog that is threatened or endangered in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Studies have been done to see why the population of the frog is beginning to decrease in those states. Blanchard's cricket frogs are commonly found in wetlands, ponds, and/or near row crop agriculture. The average life span for this frog is about one year, which is why the species is considered to be short-lived. Little is known about the interactions and basic ecology, even though populations are decreasing. Blanchard's cricket frog was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the northern cricket frog.\nDescription.\nBlanchard's cricket frogs are a type of aquatic tree frogs in North America. They have warty skin that is usually brown, gray, tan, or olive green, with darker bands of color on the legs. Their skin is also heavily vascularized, which allows substances to get into their bodies quickly, increasing their susceptibility to diseases. Due to this, handling with bare hands is unadvised. A dark, triangular mark between the eyes is frequently seen, and can be used to easily identify the species. Many different colors can be seen on certain specimen's backs, usually being either a dark red, orange, light green, or in rarer cases, a combination. They are small frogs, growing to in length on average.\nBlanchard's cricket frogs hibernate during the cold months, beginning in late October, and emerging from hibernation in late March or early April. Breeding occurs from mid-May to mid-July. Females lay small clusters or single eggs. Tadpoles emerge in late summer. Breeding males have a metallic clicking call distinctive to the species. The subspecies is named after Frank N. Blanchard, a noted American herpetologist. The frogs are most commonly found in slow-moving or stagnant bodies of water, such as in streams and wetlands, where reproduction takes place. Only a few survive until the second breeding season. If a breeding season isn't productive, the population for that area can decline.\nConservation.\nBlanchard's cricket frogs can be found through most of the Midwest United States, ranging from Michigan and Wisconsin in the north to southern Texas in the south and from Colorado in the west to West Virginia in the east. Although not listed at the federal level, Blanchard's cricket frogs are considered at risk in some states. It is an endangered species in Wisconsin, and is a threatened species in Michigan, due to a significant population decline since the late 1970s. Habitat loss, chemical contaminants, and competition for resources have been posited as reasons for this decline. Populations can still be found in the southern and western portions of Michigan's Lower Peninsula.\nIn Minnesota, where the state's Department of Natural Resources includes \"A. blanchardi\" as a subspecies of \"A. crepitans\", both taxa are collectively considered endangered. \"A. blanchardi\" may also still be on Pelee Island, Ontario, Canada, but has not been reported since 1987. It was thought that competition by Bullfrogs caused a decrease in the population of Blanchard's cricket frog, however, a study found no evidence that Bullfrog tadpoles took enough resources from Blanchard's cricket frog tadpoles to impact them. Another study of the immune defense traits of Blanchard's cricket frog showed that multiple factors can influence the immune system of the frog, for example water conductivity, water surface area, and ratio of natural to managed land. All of these factors were found to influence the skin microbiome of the frog, and compromise the frog's immune system. While some decreases in population are due to chemical contaminants and competition for resources, the major reason for the decrease is still unknown."

As previously, all players within 10 shots of the leader also make the cut. 61 players made the cut, all those within 10 shots of the leader. Fourteen-year-old Guan Tianlang, playing in his first Masters, was the only amateur player to make the cut, despite being penalized a stroke for slow play.\nAmateurs: \"Guan (+4)\", Vogel (+8), Weaver (+8), Smith (+11), Fox (+13), Dunbar (+16).\nNote: Tiger Woods originally signed for a 71 which gave him 70-71=141 (−3). However, his second-round score was adjusted on Saturday morning to a 73 (see below).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 13, 2013\"\nPrior to the third round, a controversy concerning Tiger Woods developed. After Friday's second round, Woods signed for a score of 71 (−1), which included a bogey at the par-5 15th hole. Woods' third shot had hit the pin and rebounded into the water hazard. He took a penalty stroke and appeared to take his drop at the same position from which he had played his third shot. In an interview following the round Woods stated that he had actually dropped the ball two yards further back from the pin than the original position. Based upon hearing the interview, tournament officials met with Woods Saturday morning and deemed the drop to have been in contravention of the rules. This could have meant disqualification, but instead Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the illegal drop. He therefore scored a triple-bogey 8 at the 15th and had an adjusted second round score of 73 (+1).\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 14, 2013\"\nSummary.\nIn the final round, played in a cold and steady rain, third round co-leader Brandt Snedeker fell out of contention with a 75. Jason Day had the lead with three holes to go but bogeyed the 16th and 17th holes to finish in third place at 281 (−7). Adam Scott and Ángel Cabrera both birdied the 72nd hole to finish tied for the lead at 279 (−9). Playing in the group ahead of the final twosome, Scott rolled in a 25-footer (8 m). Minutes later Cabrera matched Scott's birdie when he hit his approach shot to 3 feet (1 m) and made the putt to force a playoff.\nThe sudden-death playoff began at the 18th hole, where Scott and Cabrera both scrambled for par from just short of the green after their approach shots each landed on the front section of the green and backed just off the fringe, with Cabrera's chip nearly holing out. At the next hole, #10, both were in the fairway then on the green in regulation. Cabrera's lengthy putt just missed and he tapped in for par. With the opportunity to win and in fading light, Scott sank his birdie putt for the victory. It was Scott's first major championship and the only time an Australian has won the Masters, after producing nine runners-up in the tournament. Following his victory, he paid tribute to Greg Norman: \"It was one guy who inspired a nation of golfers, and that is Greg Norman\". Earlier that day, Norman said that if an Australian won the title \"it would mean everything to [him]\".\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nScorecard.\n\"Playoff\"\n\"Cumulative sudden-death playoff scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "Dan Jennings (baseball manager)",
        "text": "Daniel Ray Jennings (born September 16, 1960) is an American professional baseball manager and executive. He is the former manager and general manager of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB). He served as a scout in MLB beginning in 1986 and was the manager of the Marlins from May until the end of the 2015 season. He works in scouting for the Washington Nationals.\nEarly life.\nJennings attended Satsuma, Davidson and Fairhope High Schools in Alabama while his father, Don, moved between baseball coaching jobs. Don eventually settled in as the longtime coach at Coastal Alabama Community College. Jennings graduated from Fairhope in 1978.\nJennings attended the University of Southern Mississippi, where he played college baseball for the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles. He transferred to William Carey University and played baseball there as well, graduating in 1984.\nProfessional career.\nUndrafted out of college, Jennings tried out for the New York Yankees in 1984, who signed him. He appeared in spring training for the Greensboro Hornets, the Yankees' Class A affiliate.\nCoaching and executive career.\nJennings coached the baseball team at Davidson High School in Mobile, Alabama from 1985 until 1988. Jennings simultaneously served as an associate scout for the Cincinnati Reds beginning in 1986. He was named an area scout for the Seattle Mariners in 1988. The Mariners promoted him to crosschecker in 1995, and he accepted a job with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as their scouting director later that year.\nJennings joined the Marlins as Vice President of Player Personnel in 2002. He was named the Marlins' assistant general manager in September 2007. At the end of the 2013 season, the Marlins promoted Michael Hill to president and Jennings to general manager. At one point, there was a pitcher for the Marlins also named Dan Jennings, but the two are not related.\nJennings was appointed Marlins' interim manager on May 17, 2015, following the firing of Mike Redmond, with assistant GM Mike Berger taking over as general manager. The move was widely considered unorthodox in that Jennings had no coaching experience above the high school level decades earlier and had no professional playing experience. It was described in \"Business Insider\" as \"shocking,\" in \"Sports Illustrated\" as \"weird,\" on \"Grantland\" as \"utterly baffling\" and in \"USA Today\" as \"bizarre\" and optically \"problematic\" for the troubled Marlins front office. On October 29, 2015, the Marlins fired Jennings and hired Don Mattingly as manager. Only three weeks earlier, the team had said that Jennings would return to his general manager role, for which he was under contract until 2018.\nOn January 8, 2016, Jennings was hired by the Washington Nationals to serve as an assistant to Mike Rizzo, the GM of the Nationals. It was reported that Jennings would assist with scouting. The Marlins filed and lost a grievance against the Nationals that March. They unsuccessfully argued that the $100,000 salary the Nationals were paying Jennings was too low for his responsibilities and not enough to offset the $1.5 million the Marlins still owed him."

The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals.\nWith 16 boats in heats, the best boats qualify directly for the semi-finals. All other boats progress to the repechage round, which offers a second chance to qualify for the semi-finals. Unsuccessful boats from the repechage must proceed to final C, which determines the last four places, from 13–16.

Since 1995, a single game is held, preceded by an entertainment program and parade of participating teams. The ceremonies is usually held at the third Sunday of October.\nOverview.\nAn opening ceremonies is held to mark the start of the season since the league's maiden season in 1975. The ceremonies typically start with an entertainment show, depending on the theme for that year. Usual highlights are performances of Filipino artists and speeches from the league commissioner and other invited guests. A parade of participating teams follows afterwards. Each team marches into the venue together with their muses. After all of the teams have paraded, the season's chairman of the PBA Board of Governors gives a speech and afterwards, he will officially declare the season open.\nAfter the opening ceremonies, a lone game, the first game for the season, will be played. From 1975 to 1994, two games were played immediately following the ceremonies.\nVenue.\nFrom 1975 to 1984, the league opened its season at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, the league's primary venue for its games. After the league transferred its operations at the University of Life Theater and Recreational Arena (ULTRA) in Pasig, the opening ceremonies were exclusively held there from 1985 to 1992. After the fallout between the PBA and the Philippine Sports Commission, which operates the ULTRA, the league transferred its operations at the then newly built Cuneta Astrodome in Pasay in 1993. The league's opening ceremonies and the majority of its games were held at the Astrodome from 1993 to 1998. After the exclusive contract in the Cuneta Astrodome expired in 1999, the league returned to its previous home, The ULTRA, now renamed as the PhilSports Arena and held its opening ceremonies there for the first time in six years. When the league celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2000, the opening ceremonies were held at the Araneta Coliseum, where the league was inaugurated. The ceremonies were held at the venue exclusively until 2013.\nFor the 2013–14 season, the league's opening ceremonies was held at three different locations covering Luzon (Smart Araneta Coliseum, Quezon City), Visayas (Cebu Coliseum), and Mindanao (USEP Gymnasium, Davao City).\nThe league opened its 2014–15 season at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan; this was the first time that the league had its opening ceremonies outside Metro Manila and it was the first non-Iglesia ni Cristo and commercial event that was held in the arena.\nThe 2015–16 season opener was supposed to be held on October 18, 2015, at the Smart Araneta Coliseum but was suspended due to the onslaught of Typhoon Lando (international name: Kuppo). Instead, the opening was held on October 21 at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. This was the first time for the following: suspension of opening ceremonies due to bad weather, an opening ceremonies that was held on a weekday, and the first opening ceremonies held in the Mall of Asia Arena.\nDue to COVID-19 related restrictions, the 2021 opening ceremonies were held at the Ynares Sports Arena with no audience in the venue. The traditional parade of teams with muses was not done and a “simple” opening ceremonies were held instead. Players were present virtually."

        "title": "List of Sussex County Cricket Club grounds",
        "text": "Sussex County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Sussex. Although Sussex representative sides had been playing cricket since the mid-eighteenth century and had also played first-class cricket matches since 1815, the County Cricket Club was established on 1 March 1839. They have played first-class matches since 1839, List A matches since 1963, and Twenty20 matches since 2003.\nUnlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" away from the club's main headquarters has diminished since the 1980s. In total, Sussex have played first-class, List A and Twenty20 cricket at 17 different grounds across the county.\nThe club's first fixture was played at the Royal New Ground, Brighton. The ground was Sussex's main ground until 1848, when the Royal Brunswick Ground in Brunswick, Hove became the main ground. In 1872, the land of the Royal Brunswick Ground was required for the expansion of the town, so the club relocated to the County Ground, which continues to be the main ground for Sussex Cricket Club. The County Ground was the venue where Sussex claimed the 2003 and 2007 County Championships. It is also the only ground in Sussex to have hosted international cricket; in the 1999 World Cup, a One Day International between India and South Africa was played at the ground.\nIn 1849, the club used a venue outside Brighton for the first time, when they played a first-class match at Petworth Park New Ground; the match against Surrey is notable for being one of Sussex's lowest aggregate scoring matches of all time, with only 287 runs scored. It was also the only time that Petworth Park hosted a Sussex match. Sussex have frequently used out grounds to host some of their matches, typically as part of cricket festivals. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, their main out grounds were the Central Recreation Ground in Hastings, The Saffrons in Eastbourne, the Cricket Field Road Ground in Horsham, and the Arundel Castle Cricket Ground (from 1972). After the Central Recreation Ground was demolished in 1996, Sussex also played two List A matches at Horntye Park, Hastings' other cricket ground. Eastbourne cancelled its proposed fixture in 2001 and did not host another county match until 2017, whilst Horsham was not awarded any matches for the 2016 season, due to financial difficulties. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of Sussex's matches in 2020 and 2021 were played at the County Ground. In 2020, Hampshire played some \"home\" fixtures at Arundel, as the Rose Bowl was being used by England.\nThe County Ground and Arundel Castle are the only two grounds to have hosted Sussex Twenty20 matches.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Sussex County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2020 season. Only matches played by Sussex County Cricket Club since its establishment in 1839 are included in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\""

        "text": "The statue of George IV in Trafalgar Square, London, is a bronze equestrian statue by Sir Francis Legatt Chantrey. It depicts the King dressed in ancient Roman attire and riding bareback. The sculpture was originally designed to sit on top of the Marble Arch at the entrance to Buckingham Palace, but was placed in its current location following the King's death.\nHistory.\nSir Francis Leggatt Chantrey originally designed the statue to stand on top of Marble Arch in its original position as the entrance to Buckingham Palace, following architecture work by John Nash. Edward Blore took over the work, and his redesign to reduce costs removed the Chantrey statue. Chantrey's work was funded by George IV himself, rather than by public subscription. The statue was cast in 1828.\nGeorge IV died in 1830, and the statue was placed on an empty plinth in Trafalgar Square in December 1843, which was expected to be on a temporary basis, however it has remained there ever since. It was unveiled to little ceremony, with \"The Times\" describing it as \"somewhat suddenly erected\". It was the first statue erected on one of the pedestals, which were installed three years earlier with architect Charles Barry expecting them to be filled by groups of statues. An inscription was added towards the end of the 19th century as the public were no longer aware of whom it portrayed.\nThe journalist Janice Turner questioned the need for a statue of George IV in Trafalgar Square in 2005; in rebuttal Lord Baker of Dorking argued that the monarch still deserved the statue due to his town planning legacy which remained in London.\nIn 2012, the milliner Stephen Jones created crowns for both George IV and his horse to be added to the statue as part of the \"Hatwalk\" art project sponsored by the Mayor of London; in the project 21 milliners created new hats for famous statues around London."

        "title": "1952 Winter Olympics torch relay",
        "text": "The 1952 Winter Olympics torch relay was the first time that a flame was transported as part of the build-up to the Winter Olympics. While similar to the inaugural Summer Olympics torch relay of 1936 the Olympic Flame did not start in Olympia, instead the relay began in Morgedal, Norway, the birthplace of competitive skiing. Indeed, the Norwegian Olympic Committee were keen to stress that this was not the traditional transfer of the Olympic flame but a separate event that symbolised the use of torches while skiing in the dark. It was not until the 1964 Winter Olympics that the relay could be said to transport a true Olympic flame originating from Olympia.\nOrganization.\nOlav S. Bjaaland, a teacher in Morgedal, proposed the idea of a cross-country ski relay from Morgedal to Oslo in 1948. The process was seen as a good way to mark the commencement of the Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed that the relay could go ahead, including winning support from the IOC president, but that this relay would not carry the true Olympic flame as had been established as protocol in the Summer Games since 1936. Instead this torch was passed in the same way that Norwegian skiers historically did while travelling in the dark. Organisational duties were given to the committee for decorations and ceremonies. The flame would not be lit in Olympia, and a location would be chosen that symbolised the birthplace of skiing and Winter events. Since the 1964 relay the process has changed to bring the relay in line with the Summer Olympics and to officially carry the Olympic flame. While there were attempts to give the \"Morgedal Flame\" the same significance as the Olympic flame the IOC have insisted that all Olympic Games should use the symbolic fire lit in Olympia.\nRelay elements.\nTorch.\nThe nine inch long torch was designed to cope with any weather condition that the relay team would face. Its cylindrical handle was topped off by a large, oval collar that depicted the Olympic rings, the year, and an arrow pointing from the start and end points of the relay (Morgedal and Oslo).\nTorch-bearers.\nA total of 94 renowned skiers or their descendants participated in the relay, the names of whom remained secret until they began their leg of the journey.\nRoute.\nThe relay began on 13 February at the Morgedal home of Sondre Norheim, a pioneer in competitive skiing. The location was chosen to celebrate the birthplace of skiing and the origins of such sporting events. In 1868 Norheim had skied from Morgedal to Oslo to compete in a skiing competition that was being hosted in the city.\nIt would be fitting for a person of high regard to start the relay. Olav Bjaaland, the grandfather of the man who proposed the relay, was a member of the 1911 South Pole expedition. He was given the honour of kindling the fire, and did so by lighting a pine torch in the hearth of Norheim's home. He then passed the flame to the first relay skier. The torch relay then followed the route that Norheim is believed to have taken to Oslo.\nLighting of the cauldron.\nThe final stretch of the relay to Bislett was undertaken by ski champion Lauritz Bergendahl on 15 February. On arrival at the Marathon Gate of the Stadium he passed the torch to the final torch-bearer, Eigil Nansen, grandson of explorer, winter event champion and Nobel Peace Prize-winning diplomat Fridtjof Nansen. Nansen skied with the torch around the snow embankment before walking up to and lighting the \"Olympic Altar\"."

        "title": "Swimming Home",
        "text": "Swimming Home is a novel by British writer Deborah Levy, published in 2011. The short novel deals with the experiences of poet Joe Jacobs, when his family vacation is interrupted by a fanatical reader.\nCritical reception for the novel was generally favourable. On 25 July 2012 the book was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and on 11 September that year it was shortlisted.\n It was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize (2013). The novel was adapted into a feature film by the British director Justin Anderson. The eponymous film will compete in the Tiger Competition at the 53rd International Film Festival Rotterdam and have its world premiere in January 2024.\nPlot.\nIn the summer of 1994 the poet Joe Jacobs (Polish émigré Jozef Nowogrodzki) is on vacation in a summer home in Nice with his wife Isabel, his daughter Nina, and their friends, the couple Mitchell and Laura. The tranquillity is ruined when Joe's fan Kitty Finch turns up. Her fascination with, and sexual attraction to Joe are obvious, but Isabel invites her to stay anyway. Isabel is a foreign correspondent whose work has repeatedly taken her away from her family, and who has grown to tolerate Joe's constant infidelities.\nMeanwhile, Kitty's mental problems become more and more obvious, yet Nina is the only one who dares to address the issue. Towards the end it seems clear that Kitty is poised to kill herself. In the end, however, it is actually Joe who kills himself. As it turns out, Kitty's mental issues were just a reflection of his much more deep-founded depression. The story ends with a current-day confessional from the now adult Nina to her late father.\nCritical reception.\nCritical reception of \"Swimming Home\" was generally positive. \"The Guardian\"'s John Self found the central characters of the novel \"perfectly presented\", and also noted that it \"has repeated passages which gradually mesmerise the reader.\" Philip Womack of \"The Daily Telegraph\" claimed that \"[a]nyone who's been on a villa holiday will recognise the tensions that permeate Levy's stealthily devastating book.\" He lauded the \"hallucinatory quality\" of the book, concluding that \"[e]verything has significance...This is an intelligent, pulsating literary beast.\" Julia Pascal, reviewing the novel for \"The Independent\", describes the author's storytelling as \"allusive, elliptical and disturbing.\" In particular she appreciates how Levy \"upends expectation\", turning the novel into \"a haunting exploration of loss and longing.\""

The PlayStation 2 version was released in North America on August 14, 2001, in Japan on September 20, 2001, and in Europe on January 25, 2002, while the Game Boy Advance version was released in North America on September 12, 2001, in Japan on October 25, and in Europe on November 16. The game was released as part of Konami's ESPN The Games brand.\nFeatured skaters.\nDefault skaters\nUnlockable skaters\nGameplay.\nAside from the practice, multiplayer, and free skate modes, players can participate in an X Games competition in either street or vert. In X Games, players attempt to earn the highest score within a one-minute time limit. One of the playable levels is inspired by the halfpipe used in X Games Six. The game also has an arcade mode, where players roam levels and complete various goals, and collecting spinning X Games logos, which unlocks other playable levels.\nIn the Game Boy Advance version, players increase their attributes via the X-Rage meter, where players fill up the meter by performing tricks, which later will cause a coin to appear on the halfpipe. After the player grabs the coin, they're flown higher into the air, and players are to perform a 10-trick combo. If the player successfully accomplishes this, gems will fall down onto the halfpipe, which players can collect. If players grab enough gems of a particular color, the skater the player is playing as will have his attributes raised in a specific section.\nReception.\nIn Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of 33 out of 40. The game itself received more mixed reviews in the West, however, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. David Smith of \"IGN\" praised the ESPN integration of the PS2 version, while criticizing the aforementioned inconsistent graphics throughout the levels in arcade mode. Jeff Gerstmann of \"GameSpot\" also criticized the graphics of the same console version, along with the controls. Jim Preston of \"NextGen\" compared the game to \"plain vanilla [yogurt] without the sprinkles.\"\nCraig Harris of \"IGN\" praised the presentation of the GBA version, and unlike the PS2 version, gave a higher score for the graphics, but Harris would also criticize the overall gameplay and potential lasting appeal. Frank Provo of \"GameSpot\" said of the same handheld version, \"It is really too bad that the park competition is so incomplete and lackluster, as it virtually ensures that few people will ever purchase the game and experience the sheer joy of the more magically delicious vert competition.\" In Japan, however, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 25 out of 40."

        "text": "Angelo Robert Gaudio (July 13, 1925 – May 10, 2003) was an American football guard who played four seasons for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) between 1947 and 1951.\nGaudio grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and attended college at Ohio State University, where he played as a guard for two seasons interrupted by service in World War II. He then joined the Browns, playing under head coach Paul Brown for three seasons before retiring. The Browns won the AAFC championship in each of Gaudio's years with the team. He came out of retirement to play a final season in Cleveland in 1951. After football, Gaudio worked for his family's construction business in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and later moved to Miami, Florida to start a construction business. He died in Miami in 2003.\nHigh school and college career.\nGaudio attended Shaw High School in East Cleveland, Ohio and was a star guard on the school's football team for three seasons. He then enrolled at Ohio State University, continuing as a guard on the Ohio State Buckeyes football team beginning as a freshman in 1942. Gaudio was set to play in 1943 under head coach Paul Brown, but instead joined the Army Air Force during World War II.\nProfessional football career.\nGaudio returned to Ohio State after the war for the 1946 season. He then worked in the construction business with his father before joining the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference in the summer of 1947, despite having two years of college eligibility left. He barely made the team, but Brown, who had become the first coach of the Browns, called Gaudio \"technically perfect\" and said he had the speed and agility he wanted in a guard.\nAs part of Cleveland's offensive line, Gaudio helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and open up running room for fullback Marion Motley. He was used primarily in his first season as a defensive lineman, but played increasingly on offense the following year after assistant coach Blanton Collier praised his technique in an annual review of film from the previous season. He played more snaps in 1948 than veteran guard Lin Houston. \"Lin hasn't lost his touch, he's just as good as ever,\" Browns guard coach Fritz Heisler said at the time. \"But this fellow Gaudio has been doing a terrific job for us and we just can't keep him off the field.\"\nHelped by strong line play, Cleveland finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and defeated the New York Yankees to win the AAFC championship. The team won the championship again in 1948, winning all of its games and turning in professional football's first perfect season. The Browns again won the AAFC championship in 1949, but the league dissolved after the season and the Browns were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). Gaudio retired after the 1949 season, when he was 24 years old. He came out of retirement to play for the Browns in 1951. After the team lost the NFL championship game to the Los Angeles Rams, he retired for a second time to focus on his family's construction business.\nLater life and death.\nGaudio settled in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and by the late 1950s was the vice president of the National Construction Company, a sewer contractor. He worked in the business with his father and two of his brothers, Anthony and Harry. He later started a construction company in Miami, Florida and owned J&amp;B Gaudio Farms in Ocala, Florida. He helped found the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company, a thoroughbred racehorse auction firm, contributing a $250,000 personal loan. He died in 2003."

The winner of the elimination game then played the loser of the non-elimination game in another elimination game. The remaining two teams then played each other to determine the winner of the Qualifier 1.\nTeam Israel, under the Classic's rules, was entitled to have non-Israeli citizens of Jewish heritage play for the team. The players who qualified to play on the Israeli team included major leaguers catcher Ryan Lavarnway, first baseman Ike Davis, second basemen Ian Kinsler and Josh Satin, third basemen Kevin Youkilis and Danny Valencia, outfielders Ryan Braun (whose father is Israeli), Sam Fuld, Ryan Kalish, and Gabe Kapler, and pitchers Jason Marquis, Scott Feldman, Craig Breslow, and John Grabow, as well as what were then recent major leaguers catcher Brad Ausmus and pitcher Scott Schoeneweis. Kinsler said: \"Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, I will have a very difficult decision to make. Yuk [Kevin Youkilis], Braun [Ryan Braun], and I could make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Yuk – we always laugh about things like this.\" Outfielder Shawn Green, who retired in 2007, was also eligible inasmuch as he is Jewish, and said in early June 2011 that assuming it works out, it \"would be an honor\" and he \"would love to\" play for Israel in the Classic.\nBecause they were held in September, however, with the Major League Baseball season still in progress, Qualifiers 1 and 2 could not feature major league players such as the above ones who qualified to play for Team Israel. Kevin Youkilis announced that he would play for the team if they made it past the qualifying round.\nThe highest-level players involved in Qualifiers 1 and 2 were minor-league prospects ranked among the top 20 in their respective organizations. Team Israel, managed by former major league All Star Brad Ausmus and coached by former major leaguer Gabe Kapler, included minor league pitchers Eric Berger (1–0) and Brett Lorin, first baseman Nate Freiman (.417; 4 HR in 12 AB), second baseman Josh Satin (.273), shortstops Jake Lemmerman and Ben Orloff, and outfielders Adam Greenberg, Ben Guez, Joc Pederson (.308), and Robbie Widlansky. Also, retired major leaguer Shawn Green played for Israel (.333).\nIn Qualifier 1, Israel and Spain both won easily in the first round. Israel then beat Spain in the winner's bracket. Spain then eliminated South Africa to earn a rematch with Israel. Spain won the winner-take-all final game, 9–7 in 10 innings, to advance to the main tournament.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

It was released on 4 June 2021, and is still in early access as of 10 March 2022.\nGames.\n\"Tennis Elbow\" (1997).\nThe first release in this tennis series allows players to compete in a World Tour of 90 events against 250 players. Single matches can be dirty up and dirty down (two against one) as well as the more conventional singles and doubles. Grass, clay, flexi and cement courts are featured. Action replays can be viewed in slow motion, fast speed, and rewound.\nPlayers can be defined as volleyers, defenders, punchers or varied, with definable kit colours and playing abilities. As you play the game, your player’s ability improves, resulting in faster and more accurate serves as well as faster running and bigger jumps.\nThe action is viewed from a 3rd-person angle, and side changes are optional. Two buttons are used in combination with directional presses to make slices, 3 different types of lob, and subtle drop shots.\n\"Tennis Elbow 2004\" is an enhanced Windows port of the original Tennis Elbow \n\"Tennis Elbow 2006\" (2006).\nTennis Elbow 2006 allows players to compete in a World Tour of 125 events against 300 players.

It features a simulative approach to tennis, and offers, along with local and online multiplayer, three singleplayer modes: training, single match, and World Tour, a career mode.\nThe World Tour sees you play with your created player, or an existing one (there are several dozens of real-world unlicensed famous and less famous, including — as to the males — Sampras, Agassi, Kafelnikov, Becker, Stich, Edberg and more, Graf Navratilova Sanchez Vicario Seles and more as for the females) and start from the bottom of the ranking and the smallest tournaments, with the aim to gain the top position in world rank during a span of 15 years. Available tournaments over a whole year are about three hundreds, but low ranked players can not access main competitions.\nGameplay can be tweaked to more or less simulative through options such as turning fatigue on or off, having the indicators of where our shots and the opponent's will impact on the court displayed or not, different CPU levels (6 in total, from \"beginner\" to \"incredible\"), and choosing from Arcade, Simulation, Elite \"Controls\", which impacts the gameplay, making it easier or harder to do good shots.\nPlayer statistics include parameters for power, consistency, precision, for each of the fundamental shots (forehand, backhand, service), plus for volley play (net presence, forehand and backhand volley, smash), fitness (speed, tonicity, stamina), and special skills (drop shot, lob, counter, stamina); parameters range from 1% to 100%.

Will you be able to lead your players to the top of the world hierarchy?\nThe game also features a full 3D match engine, which lets you play tennis as you want in the Training Club.\nIn addition, you can optionally take the control of your player during the tournament 3D matches. A little warning though: the management part will get a bit unbalanced from this, as some skills will be of lesser importance when you play all by yourself.\nThe match engine is based on the Tennis Elbow 2013 one, already acclaimed by many players as the most realistic tennis game, but with a new &amp; improved physics for the ball, court, strikes &amp; players !\nThe AI is also greatly improved, with new player strategies and more realistic behaviors.\nThe game was released early access in the official website on March 8, 2018, then in Steam on June 7, 2019.\n\"Tennis Elbow 4\".\nThis game uses the Unity Engine. It launched on 4th June 2021 in early access. As of February 2023, it is still in early access."

He played at representative level for New Zealand (Heritage № 45), and Nelson, as a , or , i.e. number 2 or 5, or, 3 or 4.\nPlaying career.\nKaitoa/Albion club, and Nelson representative side.\nIn 1909 James played 2 matches for the Hornets rugby league team. Then in 1910 he joined the Kaitoa club and played 10 matches, all against the St Mary's Catholic Club. He scored 2 tries in a 28 May game against Alhambra and another in a 23 July match against the same opponents. It is likely he scored a good deal more than this during his seasons with them though the local newspapers rarely wrote detailed match reports. His form was good enough to gain him selection for the NZ team. Later in the season he played in 2 trial matches for the Nelson side which he was subsequently selected for. Nelson then played a match against the touring Auckland side. He scored 2 tries and kicked 2 conversions in their 24-13 loss at Trafalgar Park.\nIn 1911 the Kaitoa club changed their name to Albion. He played 8 matches for them during the season again against St Mary's. He played in a Nelson trial match to gain selection for their Northern tour. He played in all 3 matches against Auckland at Victoria Park, Taranaki at Eltham, and Wanganui at Cooks Gardens.\n1912 appears to be the last season that James played rugby league. He played a match for Nelson against the touring Wanganui side on 7 April followed by another match for Nelson against Wellington on 8 June. Then he appeared in a club match for Albion against St Mary's with there being no further mention of him playing in any of the local Nelson newspapers. With the outbreak of war rugby league was no longer played in the Nelson area for many years.\nInternational honours.\nJames won a cap for New Zealand during the 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, playing left- in the 20-52 defeat by Great Britain at the Domain Cricket Ground, Auckland on Saturday 30 July 1910. He was said to have played well and his pass set up New Zealand's first try. He was said by one of the non playing English players to have been the best New Zealand back alongside Ernie Buckland of Taranaki.\nLater years.\nJames served with the 1st Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade during World War I and was killed in France on 6 August 1917."

The first recorded match to be played on the ground was a first-class match between an England XI and the touring Australians in 1899, which the Australians won by 7 wickets. During the match, Len Braund of the England XI made the highest individual score with the bat of 63, while the Australians Ernie Jones took the best bowling figures with 7/31. This was the only first-class match to be played at the ground. Cornwall first played there in a friendly against Glamorgan in that same year, while they played their first Minor Counties Championship at the ground in 1904 against Monmouthshire. They played a further fixture there against Devon in that same season, with the ground hosting a single Minor Counties Championship match from 1905 to 1912, when Cornwall played their last fixture there against the Kent Second XI. Long since abandoned for cricketing purposes, it is likely the ground was located in the grounds of Alverton Manor, a likely location for it being in the western grounds of the manor, on two sites, one of which is now covered by housing and the other which is partially open land and partially covered by Truro Magistrates Court. The ground remains the only venue in Cornwall to have hosted first-class cricket and the most westerly part of England in which first-class cricket has been played."

        "title": "Southwestern Athletic Conference baseball tournament",
        "text": "The Southwestern Athletic Conference baseball tournament decides the conference baseball championship of the NCAA Division I Southwestern Athletic Conference. The top four finishers in each conference division participate in a two-bracket, double-elimination tournament, most recently played in Birmingham, Alabama, between May 25 and May 29, 2022. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament and, since 2019, to the HBCU World Series.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe SWAC was established in 1920, and the conference is known to have sponsored baseball as a league sport until around the uncertain times of the Great Depression and World World II before sanctioning it again in 1949. Between 1959 and 2003, only Southern, Jackson State, and Grambling State won SWAC championships. The league office itself has even been known to refer to these schools as the \"Big Three.\" However, since 2004, seven programs have won championships, suggesting greater competitiveness in the league. Also, with the SWAC tournament now including eight schools, simply more lower-seeded teams have an opportunity to compete for the conference crown. However, allowing lower-seeded teams to stake claim to the title and automatic bid to the NCAA tournament may have also come with a price; from 2000—when the SWAC tournament field expanded to six teams—to 2016, SWAC entrants went just 4–36 in NCAA regional play.\nOrigins of the modern tournament.\nThough the league championship was normally determined by the regular season conference standings, for a brief time after the SWAC renewed sponsorship of baseball in 1949, a championship series was held. The roots of the modern tournament began in 1977 when the league split into eastern and western divisions, with the division winners facing off in a best-of-three championship series; Jackson State and Southern met in that first series. A true tournament format was initially planned for the conclusion of the 1980 regular season, but SWAC officials were unable to assemble it in time—so another two-team championship series ended up being held in its place instead. After the 1980 series featured a fourth consecutive JSU–SU match-up, the series was successfully converted into a more inclusive four-team, double-elimination tournament for the 1981 season, guaranteeing that at least one school that had never won the SWAC title before could compete in it (the four-team field was expanded to six teams in 2000 and eight teams in 2008). That first tournament, held in Grambling, Louisiana, actually had the reverse effect though as it included division champions Grambling and Alcorn State—but then still gave division runners-up Southern and Jackson State yet another opportunity to win the title; indeed, Southern did win the rain-delayed tournament. Only Alcorn State's 1997 title game appearance prevented the Big Three from having a complete monopoly over the finals until 2003. However, between 2003 and 2019, every single title game had at least one non-Big Three team in it.\nHost cities and venues.\nInitially, the earliest tournaments alternated between the home stadiums of the western and eastern division champions. Although the event had been played off-campus before (at Pete Goldsby Field, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana), it was played in a non-qualifier's hometown (Houston, home of Texas Southern) for the first time in 1985 and then moved to its first true neutral location for the 1986 edition—a rainy affair held at the old Bringhurst Field in Alexandria, Louisiana. But the tournament has not evolved without growing pains. It has changed locations numerous times over the years (including nine different stadiums for the eight tournaments played between 1999 and 2006). The tournament has not necessarily been easy for potential host cities to bid on, as the SWAC office has sometimes preferred bids that cover multiple sports facilities for an entire \"SWAC Spring Sports Festival\" encompassing all league-sponsored sports that have championship tournaments near the end of the spring semester. Also, promises made during these bidding processes have not necessarily always come to pass. For example, the 2004 championship game was supposed to be played at Minute Maid Park, a Major League Baseball stadium, but this was ultimately not pursued after Houston's bid was accepted.\nEvolving tournament formats.\nThe competition's changing format has also been questioned. In 2002 a weary columnist for the Baton Rouge \"Advocate\" lamented, \"The SWAC Tournament has had a different venue and a different format each of the last four years. In that span, there have been times where both the site and the format were decided just weeks before the event.\" Indeed, multiple people associated with the Southern program over the years have expressed disappointment with format adjustments, hinting that it could be done to reduce odds of the Jaguars winning yet another tournament. One of the tournament's most vocal critics has been Roger Cador, who served as an assistant or head coach at Southern during most of the SWAC tournaments that have been held. In 2019 the league office responded by hiring Cador in an advisory role as staff liaison to \"assist with marketing, promotions, and game management/event operations\" for the tournament.\nNotable games and superlatives.\nSouthern ultimately ended up advancing to the first twelve playoff and tournament championship games and then reached another nine in a row between 1991 and 1999. Besides the partial cancellation of the 1980 tournament, in 1993 the then-Natchez, Mississippi-based tournament was canceled by SWAC commissioner James Frank before the championship game could be played, due to the field's condition after enduring lightning and rain delays with only \"makeshift tarps\" available; the title game participants, Jackson State and Southern, were subsequently declared co-champions. This was not the first rain-plagued tournament held in Natchez, nor was it the last. In 1994 rain pushed Southern into playing three full nine-inning games on the day of the championship; the exhausted team ended up losing the finale by a mere one run. In 1995 the stadium was double-booked with Mississippi High School Activities Association playoff games during one of the days. In 2004 Texas Southern not only broke the Big Three's hold on the trophy but also set a title game scoring record in the process by winning 18–1. The 2005 tournament, which was held at historic Rickwood Field in Birmingham—then the new home of the SWAC offices—was suspended during the record 15th inning of the championship game due to stray gunfire generated from a gang fight that occurred on the street behind the center field wall; the teams and fans alike were forced to scramble for cover. Since then, the tournaments have been held relatively drama-free; however, even then rain delays at the 2008 event required the use of an additional facility in an attempt to stay on schedule with its new eight-team format. In 2021 JSU (which had finished 24–0 in league play and was also undefeated in the conference tournament) lost the title game to Southern 7–6 following a dramatic 3-run, ninth inning home run; the responding outfielder was unable to make a play on the ball after colliding with, and falling through, an unlocked bullpen gate.\nCurrent status.\nA multi-year contract to hold the tournament at LaGrave Field in Fort Worth, Texas starting with the 2013 tourney was canceled after only one year due to the venue being in a state of disrepair. The event found a stable home after that at Wesley Barrow Stadium in New Orleans, which is associated with initiatives by the Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy to promote increased participation by minorities in the sport—something that the SWAC has a vested interest in as a conference for historically black universities. In 2019 New Orleans served as a host city for the SWAC tournament for the tenth time—the most of any city (Natchez's Chester Willis Field is the venue that has hosted both the most tournaments overall and the most consecutive tournaments—eight between 1988 and 1995). A three-year deal was then signed in 2020 to return the tournament to Smith–Wills Stadium in Jackson, Mississippi. However, just two weeks after that agreement was announced, the NCAA canceled all spring championship events for the 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, less than a month before the 2021 tournament, it was announced that it would be relocated from Jackson to Toyota Field in Madison, Alabama \"due to enhanced COVID–19 protocols.\" The 2022 tournament was relocated as well, to Birmingham.\nChampions.\nConference tournament championships by year.\nThe following is a list of conference tournament champions and tournament sites, organized by year. The tournament determined the conference's overall championship each year that it was played; in years that it was not held, conference standings generated through regular season play determined the overall champions. However, the league office apparently does not acknowledge titles earned prior to 1959 in its public releases. It is not immediately clear if this is due to space constraints or poor record-keeping—or if the conference simply does not consider pre-1959 titles as \"official.\" At that time the SWAC began to change significantly with a shift in membership from smaller, private Christian colleges in and around Texas—many of whom are now members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics's Red River Athletic Conference—to larger, secular public universities spread throughout the Deep South (Grambling and Jackson State were particularly notable additions, especially as far as baseball competition was concerned), and Southern also won the 1959 NAIA World Series. The conference also began to change demographically at that time as well, with southern universities beginning to integrate.\nConference tournament championships by school.\nThe following is a list of conference tournament champions, organized by school."

Davies, who has played table tennis competitively since 1991, was selected for the 2012 Paralympic Games, and took the bronze medal in the men's individual class 1 event.\nCareer history.\nDavies was born in 1966 and grew up in Cardiff, Wales, before moving to Cornelly in Bridgend. In 1986 he was involved in a motorbike accident which left him paralyzed.\nDavies played table tennis in his free time, but in 1991 he became far more involved in the sport. A veteran of the sport for twenty years, Davies came to prominence in the build-up to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. In the 2011 European Championships in Split, Croatia, he and fellow British player Rob Davies took the silver medal in the class 1 men's team competition.\nIn 2012, Davies and Rob Davies entered the Slovakian Open in Bratislava, taking the gold medal in the men's team, while Paul Davies won silver in the men's singles. That year both he and his team mate Davies qualified for the Great Britain team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the men's single class 1 event. At the London Paralympics, Davies was placed in group C, along with Andrea Borgato of Italy and Andreas Vevera of Austria. He beat Borgato in straight sets, but Vevera was a harder prospect, Davies coming from 2–1 down to win by three sets to two. This allowed Davies to progress to the semi-finals where he met eventual gold medalist Holger Nikelis of Germany. Nikelis was too strong an opponent on the day, beating Davies in straight sets. Although out of the top medal positions, Davies was placed into bronze medal contention, facing the other semi-final loser, Lee Chang Ho of South Korea. The match went the full five rounds, with Davies the eventual winner, earning him the bronze medal."

        "title": "Liverpool Cricket Club",
        "text": "Liverpool Cricket Club is a cricket club in the city of Liverpool, England. The club has had four home grounds and since 1880 has been at Aigburth Cricket Ground. \nThe club was founded in 1807 and was under the control of the merchants and ship owners of Liverpool, many of whom had been slave traders. The early history of the club was heavily influenced by the slave owner and railway director Hardman Earle. \nThe club's most famous player is Ken Cranston, the former England Cricket Team captain. Noel Chavasse, a member, died in service during World War I, he was one of only three men to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice.\nMosslake Field ground.\nBanastre Tarleton, the Member of Parliament for Liverpool and slave trader is credited with introducing cricket to the city in the late 18th century. The first recorded game played in Liverpool was in the year 1800 on a ground known as Mosslake Field which was at Mount Pleasant. The players wore white trousers, linen shirts and a tall black hat known as a Billycock.\nThe club was formed in 1807 as the Mosslake Field Cricket Society. Membership cost 7 shillings and players were fined six pence for being late to matches. It is apparent from newspaper articles that other clubs existed in Liverpool at this time. The first game reported in a newspaper was written in the \"Leeds Intelligencer\" on 30 August 1812. The match between Liverpool and Rochdale concluded in a 42 run victory for the latter. \nIn 1822, the club was playing other teams such as Chester and Brunswick. The club was under the control of the merchants and ship owners of Liverpool, many of whom had been slave traders or were current owners of slaves in British overseas colonies. In the same year, the members rewrote the rules to ensure they kept control of the club. The members went on to forge close trading links with the city of Manchester, using cricket as a vehicle to do so. When Manchester Cricket Club was formed, Liverpool quickly set up a match.\nTunnel Road ground.\nOne of the Liverpool players was Hardman Earle, a railway man, who was involved in the creation of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway line. The Earle family were steeped in the slave trade and were involved in the club from its inception, Hardman Earle owned slave plantations in modern day Guyana. \nIn 1828, the club moved from Mosslake Field to their second ground at Tunnel Road, Edge Hill. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway line opened in 1830, with a station at the club's new ground, most likely placed there by Hardman Earle. In 1846, the railway line was absorbed into the London and North-Western Railway, this allowed perishable goods to be shipped into Liverpool more easily and consequently the ground was sold and became a fruit and vegetable depot.\nSpekefield ground.\nIn 1845, the club moved to their third ground, a plot of land leased from Hardman Earle on his Spekefield Estate. The estate had been given to Hardman Earle by his father Thomas Earle, who had been one of Liverpool's most prolific slave traders. The early matches at this ground were between Liverpool and Manchester, or other clubs the members deemed to have a high social standing. The members built a pavilion and employed caterers to cook food, in later years a stone wall was built around the ground allowing spectators to be charged to watch as they came through a gate. In 1847, the fourteen of Liverpool took on a precursor to the England Cricket team, known then as the XI of England, with the match ending in a draw. The members continued to use the club to promote their business interests, many of them were involved in the cotton trade, importing raw cotton from overseas slave colonies, then shipping it to Manchester to be turned into linen for re-export from the Port of Liverpool.\nIn 1859, their status as Liverpool's leading club was confirmed by a visit from the prestigious Zingari Cricket Club. Zingari visited again in 1861, after this match the satirical magazine \"Porcupine\" wrote that the Liverpool team had selected players based upon their social standing rather than their cricketing ability. A rival publication, the \"Saturday Review\", took the opposite opinion writing that the Zingari team had selected players who Lord Sefton had wanted to dine with, as the whole team were staying with him on his estate. \nIn 1864, the club was involved in the creation of Lancashire County Cricket Club. In 1877, their ground was sold and for three years they had no regular home. Sir William Molyneux, 4th Earl of Sefton, became aware of the club's lack of a ground and offered the use of his own private cricket ground in front of Croxteth Hall while they looked for a permanent home.\nAigburth ground.\nIn 1880, with the help of its members, their fourth and current ground was secured in Aigburth. The ground was owned by a company called the Liverpool and South West Lancashire Cricket Company, with Liverpool Cricket Club leasing the ground from them. The owners of the ground included Hardman Earle's son, Sir Thomas Earle Second Baronet, the Earl of Lathom and many other wealthy Liverpool families. This arrangement lasted until 1904 when the owners sold the ground to Liverpool Cricket Club and sent the company into liquidation. The ground was purchased for the sum of £2,000.\nIn 1881, the club played its first match at the ground against a local team called Dingle. The away team were captained by Henry Miller, a respected all-rounder and former pupil of Uppingham School. The crowd paid six pence to watch. The Liverpool innings was opened by G Dunlop with the match abandoned because of rain. The press recorded the match saying the ground looked admirable. In 1882, the club scored a then record 500 runs in less than five hours. Later in the season, Liverpool and District played the Australia team in a five day match. In 1899, Liverpool played Cambridge University, winning by 200 runs.\nWorld War I to present day.\nIn 1913, Mr H H Hornby, President and member of the club for 65 years passed away. The Hornby family had been members since the club's outset and the death was more keenly felt because the country was on the brink of World War I. A year later, the country was at war and many of its members went off to the front lines. Frederick Harding Turner was the first player who was a casualty. He was shot and killed on 10 January 1915 while supervising a barbed wire arrangement near Ypres in Belgium. The most famous member of Liverpool Cricket Club to die in service was Noel Chavasse, who was one of only three men to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice. The club named the Chavasse Room in the pavilion in his honour. \nDuring World War II the RAF anchored a barrage balloon at the top ground and the Royal Navy occupied the lower ground. The German Luftwaffe attacked Liverpool between 1940 and 1942 and on one occasion they hit the road bridge between the upper and lower grounds. The windows of the pavilion were blown in and the canteen roof destroyed. The club hosted cricket games between military teams to maintain morale.\nLiverpool's most celebrated player is Ken Cranston, he was born in Aigburth, Liverpool and came through the junior ranks with the club before moving to Neston CC. He holds the unusual distinction of captaining Lancashire County Cricket Club on his debut. He played eight Test matches for the England cricket team between 1947 and 1948, and captained them twice. In 1993, he became President of Lancashire County Cricket Club.\nThe pavilion was for men only until 1975, and a sign on the balcony of the pavilion read: 'Dogs and ladies not allowed'. The club is the oldest sporting establishment in the city."

From that date no matches played by Liverpool and District have been ranked first-class in \"Wisden\" or other publications. In 1904, the Liverpool authorities applied to MCC for first-class status for their matches versus first-class teams but, as recorded in the MCC Minutes for May 1904, it was ruled that no Liverpool matches should rank first-class."

BRC is a community based club with a primary focus of introducing juniors to the joys of rowing with a learn-to-row program for novice scullers as well as providing facilities for masters and social rowing .\nHistory.\nBalmain Rowing Club was formed on 7 June 1882 at a meeting held at Dicks Hotel in Balmain. The meeting consisted of local citizens and the mayor and councillors of the then Balmain Municipal Council. That same year the site of Pritchard's Boatshed at the bottom of White Street was purchased and plans made to build the rowing shed at a cost of £368. The club is on the same site today.\nCompetition history.\nIn the 1910/11 and the 1911/12 seasons Balmain won the New South Wales Rowing Association's premiership pennant and was runner up in the following two seasons. When the premiership recommenced in 1919/20 after World War I, Balmain was again successful. A second place was also achieved in 1921/22 but the club suffered a lull in the next four seasons failing to score a point (win a race) in the either the senior or junior pennant from 1923 to 1927. Success wouldn't be achieved again until the last two years of the 1930s when 2nd places were again attained.\nMembers.\nOlympic and Paralympic representative members include:\nWorld champions include:"

        "text": "The Campeonato Nacional de Rugby Feminino (English: \"National championship of Women's rugby\") is the Portuguese top division of women's rugby. It is organised by the Portuguese Rugby Federation and was created in 2000, to fill the need of a women's league. Its inaugural winner was Pescadores da Costa da Caparica, who dominated the league alongside Agrária for the first five years. In 2007, Benfica broke their dominion and won three titles in a row, with Técnico stopping them in 2010. After another win for Benfica, Agrária won their fifth title in 2012, with Benfica matching that number in the competition last edition.\nSince 2013, the league is only played in the rugby sevens variant, known as \"Circuito Nacional de Sevens Feminino\". It started in 2003 and usually occurred after the rugby union season ended. Agrária dominated the competition until 2009, when Benfica won their first. They won four more titles, before being stopped by arch-rivals Sporting, who won back-to-back titles in 2016–17 and 2017-18.\nHistory.\nThe first year of an organised women's rugby league was only 2000–01, over 40 years later than their male counterpart. The first winners were Pescadores da Costa de Caparica from Almada. A year later, Pescadores narrowly lost the title to Agrária, who finished a point ahead. The third season was completely dominated by Agrária, after they won all of their matches. In 2003–04, the league changed in a different format with two groups, North and South, to determine the best four and the bottom four. In the championship playoff, Pescadores won all of their matches, taking the title out of Agrária. However, the students from the Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra returned to the right path in 2004–05, beating Benfica by two points at the championship playoff. Agrária retained their title in the following year, before Benfica won their first league title in 2006–07. In the eighth edition, the competition last stages changed from championship playoff to a Final Four, similar to other sports. On 26 January 2008, Benfica beat Agrária 21–3 to win their second consecutive title. They retain their league title in 2008–09, but in the following year, a new winner emerged: Técnico. It was the first team to break the decade-long reign of Agrária, Benfica and Pescadores. After losing the championship to Técnico the year before, Benfica dominated 2010–11, winning all of their matches and finishing with a 12-point lead. In 2011–12, Agrária won their first league title in six seasons. Although they ended level on points with Benfica, they received two more bonus points than Benfica. In what would be the last year of the competition in the traditional format played by 15 players, Benfica had another overwhelming season, winning all of their games, and conquering their fifth title.\nStarting in 2013, the league has only been played in rugby sevens. This variant was first played in 2003–04, and its first six seasons were all won by Agrária. In 2009–10, Benfica was the second team to win the \"Circuito Nacional de Sevens Feminino\", with Agrária regaining it in the following year. After one-off win by Técnico in 2011–12, Benfica won their second title in 2013, beating Técnico by 22–0. Since then, Benfica added two more league titles in 2014 and 2015, first beating SC Porto, and then Técnico. In 2016, Benfica completed the three-peat, remaining as the most dominant team of the past four years. After four years, Benfica was stopped by new contenders, Sporting, who won their first league title in 2016–17. A year later, Sporting retained their title, matching Benfica for points, but having more conversions."

It started in 2004, as the equivalent knock-out competition to the men's Portuguese Rugby Cup and is run by the Portuguese Rugby Federation. Initially played by 15 players, from 2009 that number fluctuated between 13 and 15. Starting in 2013, its only played by the Sevens variant.\nSince its first edition the competition has been dominated by Benfica, who won it on eight occasions. Its major opponent was initially Agrária, playing five finals with them; after 2012 Técnico emerged as biggest challenger and more recently, Sporting.\nHistory.\nThe Women's Portuguese Rugby Cup was created in 2004, following the rapid growth of women's rugby in Portugal at the start of the 21st century. With the first nationwide league created just four years earlier, there was a need for an annual cup competition that mimics the men's tournament, the Portuguese Rugby Cup. Its inaugural winner was Benfica who beat Agrária by 5–0. Agrária revenged that loss in the following year, defeating Benfica by 7–3. In the third year of competition, the two clubs met in the quarter-finals and Agrária beat them again. After knocking out Técnico in the semis, Agrária outpaced CDUP in the final by 22–0 on 14 April 2007, lifting their second trophy. The 2007-08 Final was a re-edition of the first two seasons, opposing Agrária against Benfica. Agrária eliminated CRAV and Agronomia, while Benfica beat RC Lousã and Técnico, in the quarter and semi-final, respectively. On 23 February 2008, on the Estádio Universitário de Lisboa, Benfica won 17–10, conquering their first trophy in 3 years. They retained it in 2008–09, after beating CDUP by 11–0 in the final. The sixth season was again disputed by the same two clubs who dominate the competition, Benfica and Agrária. After the first beat Técnico and the latter defeat CDUP in the semis, they met in Abrantes on 27 March 2010, with Benfica winning 22–0 in the fourth final between them. In 2010–11, the competition was expanded to Rugby sevens variant. On the standard format with 13 players, Benfica played their fourth consecutive final, after beating Agronomia in the semis by 51–0. They went against Técnico, who defeat Agrária by 20–10. At the Complexo Desportivo Caldas Rainha on 2 April 2011, Benfica won 21–5, extending their reign to five wins. The eighth edition was for a fifth time, decided between Benfica and Agrária. After eliminating Técnico, Benfica successfully defended their trophy on 18 February 2012, with a 27–0 win against Agrária. The streak of five consecutive wins was finally stopped in 2012–13, when Técnico beat them 14–10 on 19 March 2013.\nStarting in 2013, the competition has been exclusively for the Sevens variant. The new format split the qualifying stage in three regions, to determine a top four and bottom four. Benfica and Técnico were again the finalists after beating SC Porto and Agrária, respectively. On 8 March 2014, in Campo da Moita, Benfica revenged the loss of 2013 by beating Técnico for 29–7. The two clubs continued their contend in the next edition final, played on 14 March 2015. This time, the win fell to Técnico after beating Benfica by 14–12. In 2015–16, a new competitor appeared, Sporting, who met their cross-town rivals Benfica, on 7 May 2016, losing 27–0. Sporting would go on to win their first trophy in the competition in 2016–17 after beating Sport Rugby by 36–19. They retained the trophy in the following year after beating Benfica by 14–12."

        "title": "Jesse Williams (American football)",
        "text": "Jesse Williams (born 2 November 1990), nicknamed \"tha Monstar\", is an Australian former American football defensive tackle. Williams played college football for the University of Alabama, where he was a starter on the defensive line for the 2011 and 2012 national championship teams. The Seahawks chose him in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Although he spent the majority of his pro career on the injured reserve list, Williams became the first Australian to win a Super Bowl ring as a member of Seattle's 2013 team.\nEarly life.\nWilliams was born on Thursday Island, Queensland, to Indigenous Australian parents, and raised in Brisbane, attending Norman Park State School and Cavendish Road State High School. He grew up playing rugby league and basketball and did not start playing gridiron football until he was 14 years old. He first played football with the Bayside Ravens after he attended one of their practices to watch a friend play quarterback. In his first year as a player, Williams was named Rookie of the Year and made the Queensland Under 19 team that would go on to win Australian National Championships. For his efforts in the 2008 season, he was named Defensive Player of the Year with the Ravens.\nCollege career.\nWilliams was originally recruited by University of Hawaii coaches and offered a scholarship to play for the Hawaii Warriors football team after a Warriors scout saw him play during the Australian National Championships. He verbally committed to play for Hawaii when he was 16 years old; however, the NCAA clearing house said he was missing a mathematics and an English class and would not be able to enroll for the 2009 season. Williams later chose to enroll at Arizona Western College, after coaches saw him play in an exhibition against New Zealand while they were teaching at a football clinic. At the time, Williams was the first Indigenous Australian to receive a scholarship to play college football in the United States. At Western, Williams developed into one of the highest rated recruits out of junior college for the 2011 class. After receiving scholarship offers to play from over 25 schools, Williams enrolled in the University of Alabama for the spring 2011 semester, and began practice with coach Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide football team.\nWilliams started all 13 games of the 2011 season with the Crimson Tide at defensive end, and he made 24 total tackles and half of a quarterback sack during the course of the year. During the offseason, Williams gained a degree of internet fame when images of him bench pressing were posted to his Twitter account.\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Williams was named to the preseason award watch lists for the Chuck Bednarik Award, the Lombardi Award, the Bronko Nagurski Trophy and the Outland Trophy. He was also named to the ESPN.com Preseason All-America Team at nose tackle.\nFor the 2012 regular season, Williams was a starter for Alabama as the nose guard in 13 of the 14 games, and he made 37 total tackles, one quarterback sack and blocked a kick during the course of the year. In their 41–14 victory over the Michigan Wolverines to open the 2012 season, Williams suffered a concussion that kept him out of Alabama's week two matchup against Western Kentucky. He returned to the starting line-up for their week three game against Arkansas. In their 52–0 victory over the Razorbacks, Williams also played on offence for the first time in his Crimson Tide career when he lined up at the fullback position late in the second quarter on a one-yard Eddie Lacy touchdown run. In the SEC Championship game against Georgia he blocked for an Eddie Lacy touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter after sitting out the third quarter with a knee injury. After the season, the AP named Williams to the AP All-SEC Second-team.\nProfessional career.\n2013 NFL Draft.\nPrior to the NFL Scouting Combine, Williams, who reportedly bench-pressed a maximum of , vowed to break the 225-pound bench press record of 51 repetitions, established by Justin Ernest in 1999. However, he eventually came well short, recording 30 reps. Predicted to be selected as high as late in the first round, Williams was taken in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL Draft with the 137th overall selection by the Seattle Seahawks.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nWilliams signed his initial rookie contract with Seattle on 10 May 2013. On 26 August 2013, Williams was placed on the injured reserve list for the 2013 season as the result of a knee injury that sidelined him for the entirety of his rookie season with Seattle. Through Week 16 of the regular season, Williams rehabbed his knee in his native Australia where he used Orthokine to help with joint pain associated with his knee injury. Although he did not play a down during the season due to his injury, Williams became the first Australian to win a Super Bowl ring after Seattle's victory in Super Bowl XLVIII.\nOn 1 August 2014, Williams was again placed on the injured reserve list for the 2014 season once again as the result of a knee injury. After not playing during the regular season for a second consecutive year due to injury, the Seahawks waived Williams on 6 March 2015. Williams was re-signed on April 1, 2015.\nOn 9 March 2016, Williams was waived by the Seahawks.\nPersonal life.\nIn May 2015, Williams was diagnosed with papillary Type 2 cancer and had to undergo kidney surgery. In a statement through the Seahawks, Williams said, \"Although disappointing, I am a fighter and will handle this. I am going to focus on my health and fighting this battle with a return to football as my ultimate goal\".\nJesse has a son named Wolf.\nAfter football, Williams became a strength &amp; conditioning coach. He is part of growing the sport of American football in Australia and very passionate about community work in his local area where he was raised."

        "text": "Sergei Anatolyevich Ovchinnikov (; 25 January 1969 – 29 August 2012) was the head coach of the Russia's National Women Volleyball Team. He committed suicide three weeks after the team lost to Brazil at the 2012 Summer Olympics quarterfinals.\nBiography.\nSergei Ovchinnikov was trained at the Sverdlovsk sports boarding school, and later played for several Russian volleyball teams: \"CSKA-2\", \"SKA\" (Khabarovsk), \"Neftyanik\" (Yaroslavl), \"Oktan\" (Novokuybyshevsk) and \"Neftyanik\" (Ufa).\nSergei's coaching career began in 1998 when his former teammate Sergei Shlyapnikov invited him to join the coaching staff of \"Neftyanik\" (Yaroslavl). As an assistant coach, he was responsible for scouting young players. In 2001, he joined the staff of \"Neftyanik\" (Ufa).\nOn February 15, 2004, Ovchinnikov was appointed head coach of the \"Avtodor-Metar\" women's volleyball team in Chelyabinsk. This was his first assignment as a head coach and a change from men's volleyball to women's volleyball. During the 2005–2006 season, Ovchinnikov managed to qualify the Chelyabinsk team for the Super League, and was invited to \"Dynamo Moscow\", the best Russian team at the time, as an assistant coach. Under Ovchinnikov, the team became the champion of Russia in 2006.\nThe 2007–2008 season saw Ovchinnikov become the head coach again for the \"Dynamo\"'s farm club – \"Dynamo RGSU\". Under his guidance, the team obtained the best result ever and took third place in the Premier League \"A\".\nThe 2008-2009 season which Ovchinnikov spent coaching \"Fakel\" (Novy Urengoy) was not a favorable season for him. From the very beginning of the championship, accidental injuries sustained by key players of \"Fakel\" constrained them from actively participating in the games until the team left the elite division. Though Ovchinnikov was requested to remain coaching \"Fakel\", he preferred coaching \"Omichka\" (Omsk). Before he started working with the Omichka team, Ovchinnikov performed well in the national team as an assistant head coach to Vladimir Kuzyutkin. During the quarterfinal playoffs, \"Omichka\" clashed with \"Dynamo\" (Krasnodar) and they lost with their rivals winning “bronze” that year under the guidance of Yuri Marichev.\nMarichev, at that time, headed both teams from Krasnodar (Men's and Women's) at once. After the end of season, he returned to the men's squad and Sergey Ovchinnikov was offered to head women's team. In the 2010–2011 season, under his guidance, the Krasnodar women's volleyball team won medals in all the tournaments in which it participated: \"silver\" in the Cup of Russia, \"silver\" in the CEV Cup and \"bronze\" in the Russian League.\nOn 11 February 2012, Ovchinnikov was appointed head coach of \"Dynamo Moscow\". Under his leadership, the team won the silver medal of the Russian Championship 2011/2012.\nIn 2011 Sergei Ovchinnikov led the student team of Russia, which became the bronze medalist of the World Summer Universiade.\nOn 21 October 2011 Sergei Ovchinnikov was appointed acting head coach of Russian women's volleyball team. Two months later, on 14 December 2011, Sergei Ovchinnikov was officially confirmed as the head coach of the team. Under his leadership the team took the 1st place in the World Olympic Qualification Tournament, which was held in Tokyo on 19–27 May 2012.\nOn 29 August 2012, 43-year-old Sergei Ovchinnikov was found dead in his hotel room at his team's training camp in the Croatian town of Poreč. Croatian police, after examining the place of the tragedy, found no evidence of foul play, and concluded that it was a suicide. The reason for the suicide remains unknown, although it was pointed out that Russian media heavily criticized Ovchinnikov for the failure at the Olympic Games in London, where his team was considered as the leading medal contenders but lost in the dramatic quarter-finals to eventual winners Brazil after squandering six match points. Media reports blamed Ovchinnikov's lack of top-level international experience as the main reason for losing to Brazil. \"I could see his reaction after that loss,\" Vladimir Alekno, a head coach of the Russian men's volleyball team, told to the media. \"He took it very personally. He was very hard on himself.\"\nOn 6 September 2012, Ovchinnikov was buried in his home city of Yaroslavl. Coincidentally, his funeral took place a day before the first anniversary of the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash killed the city's hockey team. The Russian Volleyball Federation announced that it would organize a children's tournament in memory of Sergei Ovchinnikov."

Roth won four titles in 1984, upping his career title count to 31 (second to Anthony's 41), and won his first major title at the BPAA U.S. Open. Roth had previously qualified for the TV finals in ten major championships without winning. Adding to his accolades, Roth also became the PBA's second career millionaire (after Anthony) when he took the title at the Greater Detroit Open, and he capped the season by winning the Angle Touring Players Championship.\nBob Chamberlain, a 35-year-old who had toiled on and off the PBA Tour (mostly off) and had recently returned from treatment for alcoholism, won his first ever PBA Tour event at the Toledo Trust PBA National Championship. Meanwhile, Mike Durbin became the first three-time winner in the Firestone Tournament of Champions, having previously won in 1972 and 1982.\nNelson Burton, Jr. broke a 12-year-old record for a four-game TV series when he toppled 1,050 pins en route to the title at the AMF Angle Open."

        "title": "Public swimming pools in Hong Kong",
        "text": "Public swimming pools in Hong Kong are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). There are 44 public swimming pools in Hong Kong; 9 in Hong Kong Island, 13 in Kowloon, and 22 in the New Territories. LCSD manages public swimming pools according to Law of Hong Kong Chapter 132 sections 42 to 45.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nVictoria Park Swimming Pool, built and managed by the Urban Council and funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, was the first public swimming complex in Hong Kong. The 50 by 20 metre pool was officially unveiled on 16 October 1957 by former Governor Sir Alexander Grantham. It was highly popular with residents, and served over 360,000 over its first year of operation. The spectator stand seated 1,700. This facility operated continuously until 2013, when it was closed and replaced by a new indoor swimming pool (of the same name) on the site adjacent. The old pool will consequently be demolished, sparking some mourning of the loss of a piece of the collective memory of many Hong Kong residents. In response, the LCSD stated they would \"explore the possibility\" of displaying some items of historical significance, such as the plaque unveiled by Governor Grantham, at the new facility, and planned to make use of \"3D laser scanning technology\" to record the architecture of the old pool complex.\nKowloon Tsai Swimming Pool, in Kowloon Tsai Park, opened in 1964 as the first public swimming pool in Kowloon. The opening of the facility was publicised internationally in a British Pathé newsreel, which stated a construction cost of £125,000 and highlighted the lack of bathing beaches in the densely populated vicinity.\nThe first indoor heated public pool, Morrison Hill Swimming Pool in Wan Chai, opened in 1972. While many swimming facilities close in the winter season, the public now has the option of visiting 24 different public heated pools, both indoor and outdoor, which remain open during the colder months.\nMany swimming complexes of the 1960s and 1970s were funded, in part or whole, by the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. One of these was the Tsuen Wan Swimming Pool, opened 1975, which was the first public swimming pool in the New Territories. The name was changed to Kwai Shing Swimming Pool in 1978. The standardised design of the complex is typical of the era, incorporating two 50-metre pools, changing rooms and lobby located mostly underneath a covered grandstand, and several other smaller teaching pools.\nThe Pao Yue-Kong Swimming Pool complex, the only public pool in Southern District, was officially opened on 9 July 1977 by then-Governor Sir Murray MacLehose. It is named after Yue-Kong Pao, who donated funds toward its establishment.\nThe Sha Tin Jockey Club Swimming Pool, the largest pool complex in Sha Tin District, opened in April 1981. The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club funded the $33 million project in its entirety as to commemorate the opening of the nearby Sha Tin Racecourse.\nIn the 1980s, the Urban Council announced a policy of building more \"fun pools\" with special free-form designs and water toys. A councilor explained, \"It is felt that these fun pools will provide more fun, excitement and enjoyment for the public who no longer regard swimming as a mere form of exercise.\" In 1985, four such pools were planned for Kowloon and a fifth for Hong Kong Island.\nThe Regional Council (RegCo) was founded in 1986. Prior to that date, swimming pools in the New Territories fell under the purview of the Director of Urban Services, as the Urban Services Department, the executive arm of the Urban Council, had been servicing the New Territories since its establishment in 1953. The operation of New Territories swimming pools was subsequently transferred to RegCo, who also built new facilities.\nKowloon Park Swimming Pool, opened on 12 September 1989, has undergone several upgrades in recent years. It served as the venue for the aquatics events in the 2009 East Asian Games, and is today has the highest patronage of all pool complexes in Hong Kong, serving over 2000 swimmers per day.\n21st century.\nWith the dissolution of the Urban Council and Regional Council at the end of the millennium, operations of all public swimming pools were taken up by the newly formed Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).\nControversy erupted in 2004 after thousands of bloodworms were found in various public swimming pools. The worms reportedly posed no threat to humans, but LCSD management came under fire for not being forthcoming about the issue. A \"massive cleanup\" was undertaken to eliminate the worms.\n2004 lifeguard staffing cuts.\nIn 2004 the LCSD slashed the lifeguard workforce from around 2,400 to 1,580. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Life Guards’ Union has spoken out against this cut in the years since, stating that it is unsafe and puts unreasonable pressure on the lifeguards. Many swimming pools have protest signage about this issue, which the LCSD has asked the lifeguards to remove. The lifeguards have gone on strike in 2004, 2005, and 2014.\n2014 lifeguard strike.\nIn August 2014, at the height of the summer swimming season, many lifeguards serving Hong Kong's beaches and swimming pools went on strike. About 400 lifeguards staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in Sha Tin.\nLifesaving staff complained that since lifeguard numbers were cut drastically in 2004 their workload has been too great, with lifeguards having to look after greater numbers of swimmers, and warned that safety had been compromised by the government cutbacks. They said the situation has been exacerbated by crowding caused by increasing numbers of mainland tourists at Hong Kong pools and beaches. The vice chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Lifeguards' Union complained, \"some of them urinate everywhere and jump into the pool without wearing swim suits, or bring food to the venue. They don't have the same personal hygiene and safety standards.\" \nIt was suggested that the influx of mainland swimmers was a result of poor water quality in mainland Chinese swimming pools. A Shenzhen newspaper, \"Southern Metropolis Daily\", had also published an article highlighting the affordability and good facilities of Hong Kong's pools compared to those in Shenzhen. After the report was published, the number of LCSD pool closures due to contamination of the pool water with vomit or feces reached the highest level in six years. As a result of the staff shortage during the strike, some pools were temporarily closed and certain facilities at others, like toddler pools, shut down to divert staff resources.\nNew pools.\nIn recent years the LCSD has replaced several older facilities. The new HK$800 million facility at Victoria Park hosts a 50 by 25 metre main pool, a multi-purpose pool with adjustable depth floor and diving platform, and the largest swimming pool spectator stand in Hong Kong, seating 2,500. On 11 May 2011, the first phase of the new Kennedy Town Swimming Pool opened, relocated in order to facilitate West Island line construction works. On 1 April 2013, the new Kwun Tong Swimming Pool opened on a site directly adjacent to the old pool complex.\nSeveral new pools are planned. A new Wan Chai Swimming Pool recently opened to replace an older pool of the same name, which will be demolished to make way for the new Exhibition Centre station of the Sha Tin to Central Link. Another new pool is planned for Tin Shui Wai North, as the two existing pools in the new town are very crowded.\nMonthly ticket scheme.\nThe Public Swimming Pool Monthly Ticket Scheme () began on 5 July 2012 (ticket selling started on 21 June). The Leisure and Cultural Services Department is responsible for this scheme.\nThe then Chief executive Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen announced in the 2011-2012 Policy Address the introduction of \"monthly tickets for public swimming pools to encourage members of the public to swim regularly. Concessionary rates will be available for the elderly, people with disabilities, students and children.\"\nPrices are:\nAll public swimming pools in Hong Kong are available except Wan Chai Swimming Pool."

        "text": "Jake Ball (born 21 June 1991) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a lock. Ball played over 100 times for the Scarlets regional side in Wales and was capped 50 times for the Wales national rugby union team. In 2021, Ball retired from international rugby to join Green Rockets Tokatsu in Japan.\nBiography.\nBall was born in Ascot, England, to a Welsh father from Pwllheli, North Wales. His father was a rugby player who played for the London-based clubs London Welsh RFC, and Harlequins. The Ball family migrated to Australia when he was 16, where they are now based in Perth, Western Australia, which is where his four children and wife live. A keen sportsman, Ball had played in the Australian under-19 cricket championship of 2008–09.\nRugby career.\nClub.\nBall began his professional rugby career in Perth with the Western Force, with whom he trained at the age of 21 in 2012. This experience led to Ball being signed on an initial three-year deal by Welsh regional team the Scarlets in 2012. Ball made his professional debut for the club on 15 September 2012, coming on as a 61st-minute replacement in the team's victory over Connacht in the Pro 12 tournament. During Ball's spell playing in Wales for the Scarlets, he had been a part of the 2016–17 Pro12 league winning season for the Welsh side.\nAfter playing 133 games for the Scarlets, Ball moved to Japan in 2021 to play rugby for Green Rockets Tokatsu in the Japan Rugby League One. As of the beginning of 2023, Ball has played 15 games.\nInternational.\nBorn in England, Ball was also eligible to play for Wales thanks to his father, who was born in Colwyn Bay. Ball said his move to the Scarlets in 2012 was motivated by a desire to play international rugby for Wales. He received his first call-up to the Wales squad in 2014, replacing the suspended Ian Evans ahead of the 2014 Six Nations Championship. He made his debut off the bench in the 26–3 loss to Ireland in week 2 of the tournament, before making his first test start in a 27–6 victory over France in Wales' third match. Later that year, Ball was selected for Wales' tour of South Africa, and in 2015, he played for Wales in their Rugby World Cup pool game against Uruguay.\nBall became a regular starter for Wales, until a dislocated shoulder suffered in an international against New Zealand in the 2017 Autumn internationals kept him off the field for 10 months. After his return, Ball played a part in Wales' Grand Slam-winning 2019 Six Nations Championship campaign, and later that year he featured prominently in the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Ball retired from international duty in 2021 having gained 50 caps for his country.\nBBC website gaffe.\nFor Ball's inaugural international year, the BBC made him famous by mistakenly changing his surname to a rude name which was spotted by his fellow team mate Jamie Roberts and reported and subsequently changed, but not before being ridiculed on social media and in the press. As a response to the gaffe, Ball joked on Twitter that it would haunt him for the rest of his days."

        "title": "Cantabrigian Rowing Club",
        "text": "Cantabrigian Rowing Club (), known as Cantabs, is a 'town' (or CRA) rowing and sculling club in Cambridge, UK.\nHistory.\nCantabs was founded in 1950 as a rowing club for the old boys of the Hills Road Sixth Form College, then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys. It first accepted general membership in the 1960s and has been an open club since. The club is affiliated to the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association and British Rowing.\nThe club is consistently one of the fastest on the River Cam, holding the men's headship in the annual Town Bumps in 11 years since 2010, and the women's headship since 2017. The Cantabs Women's A crew consistently finish as the fastest Cambridge town club at the Women's Eights Head of the River Race, and finished 14th overall in 2017, winning the Provincial Pennant. Cantabs' B, C, D and E crews at WEHoRR were also faster than their counterparts from other Cambridge town clubs, and finished as the fastest B, C, D and E crews in the Provincial event. The Cantabs A crew won the Provincial Pennant again in 2022 and 2024.\nThe club runs the Cambridge Winter Head every November, an event that regularly attracts over seventeen hundred competitors, and is the largest one-day event on the Cam.\nFacilities.\nThe club is based out of its own boat house in Chesterton on the banks of the River Cam. The boat house has a purpose-built indoor training space upstairs, with weights facilities installed in 2016, along with static and dynamic ergs, BikeErgs and a SkiErg. Rack space for boats ranging from single sculls to eights is located both downstairs and outside. The club also makes use of the CRA boat house and Fitzwilliam College boat house in Cambridge, primarily for Cantabs' large and vibrant junior squad and for adaptive rowing for people with disabilities.\nFinancial support for this development includes Olympic legacy funding from Sport England's Inspired Facilities Fund.\nSquads.\nThe club is open to rowers, scullers and coxes of all ages, from the junior level up to masters level. Cantabs runs a number of different men's, women's and junior squads which cater for the social rower to those who wish to train and race competitively at a high level. There are a number of different squads which mean that different commitment levels and aspirations can be catered for.\nThe Senior Men's Squad has qualified at least one boat for Henley Royal Regatta in the majority of the last decade and in 2012 qualified two eights for the Thames Challenge Cup, a first for any Cambridge town club. In addition, there has been substantial individual success, with John Hale winning silver in the lightweight sculls at the 2012 British Rowing Championships before representing England in the lightweight double at the Home International Regatta and Charlie Palmer reaching the finals of the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 2005 and 2006. He is currently a biology teacher at Bedford School\nThe Senior Women's Squad races competitively at the major Tideway heads, as well as local and national regattas and, in 2015, two crews raced at Ghent International Regatta, with the women's pair winning their event (this pair went on to represent England at the Home International Regatta). Cantabs have had the fastest Cambridge town first and second eights at the Women's Eights Head of the River Race (WEHoRR) for the past few years, winning the Provincial Pennant when finishing 14th overall in 2017. Since the 2017 win the Cantabs Women's A crew has consistently placed in the top three Provincial Club crews every time that WEHoRR has run, including pennant wins in 2022 and 2024. In 2016, the senior squad won gold at the British Rowing Masters Championships in the women's A1x and C4-, won W.MasC.4+ at the Veteran Fours Head of the River, and won the IM1 pairs event at Pairs Head, where they were also the 2nd fastest W2- overall. In 2017, Cantabrigian won the Club 8+ event at Henley Women's Regatta, setting a new course record in the process. At Henley Royal Regatta, Cantabs have qualified an 8 for The Wargrave Challenge Cup each year since its inception.\nThe club has also had success with adaptive/para rowing, with Claire Connon winning the para event at Henley Women's Regatta in 2015, and representing England at the Home International Regatta on two occasions.\nClub colours.\nThe blade colours are dark blue and silver; kit: white, trimmed with blue.\nTown bumps.\nCantabs has held the Women's headship in the CRA Bumps since 2017 and the Men's Headship in 11 years since 2010. The other women's crews all hold higher positions than their equivalent crews from other clubs.\nSince 2015, Cantabs has frequently entered the largest number of crews of any club in the CRA Bumps, reflecting the size of the club. In 2018, 16 men's and 11 women's crews took part, comprising 25% of the overall entry, with crews bumping up a 'net' of 35 places in addition to retaining the two Headships."

        "title": "Grandstand (US Open)",
        "text": "Grandstand is a tennis stadium situated in the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, Queens, New York. The stadium which has a capacity to seat 8,125 people, is owned by the United States Tennis Association. The court is the third largest at the national tennis center, after the Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadiums. Built to host the US Open, Grandstand was constructed as part of a redesign of the national tennis center and is the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design tennis stadium in the world. The stadium designed by Rossetti Architects and constructed by AECOM is named after a 1978 stadium of the same name.\nHistory.\nGrandstand replaced a court with the same name that was attached to the original Louis Armstrong Stadium, which opened in 1978 and was decommissioned in 2016. The court was built as part of the USTA's $550m (£350m) scheme to renovate the National Tennis Center which was announced in August 2013 after obtaining planning permission in May of that year. The stadium was designed by Rossetti Architects and has a capacity of 8,125 seats and covers an area of 125,000 square foot. In addition it has 2,000 reserved ticketed seats in the lower bowl, with the rest being allocated on a first come first served basis. Construction of the court by AECOM began in 2015. Approximately 30 percent of the steel structure was in place by the time of the 2015 US Open. Four days after the tournament construction recommenced and the last steel piece was installed in December 2015. The court made its debut on August 29, 2016, the first day of the 2016 championships. Caroline Wozniacki beat Taylor Townsend 4–6, 6–3, 6–4 in the first match held on the court.\nArchitecture.\nThe stadium is situated in the Southwest corner of the National Tennis Center to help alleviate crowd issues and to distribute people more evenly. An estimated 20% of visitors to the site had been relocated due to the change. The tennis center was increased by 30 feet to have enough room to construct the new Grandstand court, however the USTA gave 1.56 acres of land back to compensate. The court itself was built on an old parking lot. \nThe court has 16 sides and rises higher on the southwest corner and lower in the northeast corner. This design offers view of the grounds on the upper walkways and spectators in Arthur Ashe stadium are able to look into Grandstand. Although the court has 16 sides it looks round which is deliberate to create a diversity of shapes of the stadiums on the site. It was made clear to the design team that spectators loved the intimacy and the shade of the old Grandstand and these features were incorporated into the design; with more seats in the stadium positioned in shady spots. The court is 18 feet below ground level. Due to its closeness to Flushing Meadows, the stadium was built with texture designed to be an \"interesting folly\" to patrons in the park. The outside of the stadium is made up by 400 panels of PTFE fabric to achieve this effect. Grandstand also contains a large retail store facing the main plaza and has several food vendors within its 360 degree concourse.\nGrandstand is the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design tennis stadium in the world. The stadium claimed the NYCxDesign Award in the Outdoor/Urban Landscape category. The stadium also received an honourable mention in The Architect's Newspaper Best of Design Award in Facade.\nTransport.\nThe New York City Subway and Long Island Rail Road both serve the northern end of Flushing Meadows Park, the location of the tennis centre in which Grandstand is situated. The IRT Flushing Line subway station at Mets–Willets Point serves the , and the similarly named LIRR station serves the Port Washington Branch. These stations are located at the northern end of the park adjacent to the Corona Yard and bus depot, primarily serving Citi Field and the national tennis centre. The bus from Flushing to La Guardia Airport serves the tennis centre."

The event is classified as a $60,000 ITF Women's Circuit tournament and also part of the USTA Pro Circuit calendar. It has been held in Las Vegas, United States, since 2009 and played at the Red Rock Country Club. It was previously played at the Darling Tennis Center, the former site of the ATP Tennis Channel Open.\nThe tournament was founded by Tyler Weekes of Courtthink, LLC, who also serves as the co-tournament director along with Jordan Butler, a Las Vegas attorney and a WTA-certified player agent under his agency Agent Atleta.\nIn the summer of 2012, Weekes met Redfoo (a.k.a. Stefan Gordy) of the hit techno group LMFAO and gave him a tennis lesson at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. Weekes expressed concern that his tournament was in need of a new title sponsor and soon after Redfoo agreed to have his Party Rock line of clothing become the new title sponsor of the event.\nThe Party Rock Open was held at Darling Tennis Center and featured a Cox Kids Day on the opening day of the tournament that was attended by more than 500 local Las Vegas children, as well as Redfoo. The highlight of the tournament came on semifinal Saturday night when Redfoo participated in a flash mob and was joined by hundreds of kids on court before the evening session. He sang two of his hit songs, including Party Rock Anthem and Sexy and I Know It.\nThe Party Rock Open is played the last week of September and was won in 2012 by 19-year-old American Lauren Davis, who beat fellow teenager Shelby Rogers in the final.\nIn 2014, the tournament ended its two-year association with Redfoo and Party Rock Open, which also featured the Party Rock crew and a full-time Deejay on Center Court. As a result, the tournament name changed to the Red Rock Pro Open and the site of the tournament moved back to the Red Rock Country Club, where it was originally held between 2009 and 2011 as the Lexus of Las Vegas Open.\nIn 2019, the venue of the tournament was moved to the Dragonridge Country Club Tennis and Athletic Center in Henderson and subsequently the name of the tournament was changed to the Henderson Tennis Open.\nIn 2021, the tournament was moved to the Whitney Mesa Tennis Complex."

        "text": "The qualifying phase and play-off round of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League were played from 2 July to 28 August 2013, to decide 10 of the 32 places in the group stage.\nAll times were CEST ().\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws were held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\nFormat.\nIn the qualifying phase and play-off round, each tie was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.\nIn the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. For these draws (or in any cases where the result of a tie in the previous round was not known at the time of the draw), the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.\nTeams.\nThere were two routes which the teams were separated into during qualifying:\nA total of 54 teams (39 in Champions Route, 15 in League Route) were involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round. The 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route) advanced to the group stage to join the 22 automatic qualifiers. The 15 losers of the third qualifying round entered the Europa League play-off round, and the 10 losers of the play-off round entered the Europa League group stage.\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2013 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nFirst qualifying round.\nSeeding.\nA total of four teams played in the first qualifying round.

A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 29 August 2013, 17:45 CEST (), at the Grimaldi Forum, Monaco. The 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the title holders being placed in Pot 1 automatically. They were drawn into eight groups of four containing one team from each of the four seeding pots, with the restriction that teams from the same national association could not be drawn against each other. Moreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw. On each matchday, four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) alternating between each matchday. There were other restrictions, e.g., teams from the same city (e.g., Chelsea and Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid) in general did not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tried to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days), and Russian teams did not play at home on the last matchday due to cold weather.\nTeams.\nBelow were the 32 teams which qualified for the group stage (with their 2013 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included 22 teams which entered in this stage, and the 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route).\nFormat.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the Europa League round of 32.\nTiebreakers.\nThe teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings:\nGroups.\nThe matchdays were 17–18 September, 1–2 October, 22–23 October, 5–6 November, 26–27 November, and 10–11 December 2013.

        "text": "The UIC Flames men's ice hockey was an NCAA Division I ice hockey team that played in the CCHA for most of their 15-year tenure.\nHistory.\nIllinois–Chicago began sponsoring men's ice hockey in 1966 and stayed with the lesser-classified teams when the NCAA created the tier system in the 1970s. After fifteen years in the second tier the Flames jumped to Division I, playing as an independent for one season before joining the CCHA for the 1982–83 season. With their new coach Val Belmonte the team had difficulty competing in a major conference in the early years, finishing dead last in the CCHA their first two seasons. By 1984–85 the Flames had climbed into the middle of the conference standings aided by top 10 scorer (and future NHLer) Ray Staszak, and their all-time leading defenseman Darin Banister. Two years later the Flames produced their first winning season, going 21–17–1 and winning their first postseason game (though they still couldn't get out of the conference quarterfinals). UIC finally managed to get into the CCHA semifinals in 1989 but after a dreadful season the following year Belmonte was out as coach.\nLarry Pedrie was brought in as the head coach and while the Flames saw a slight improvement in his first season UIC would remain a bottom-feeder for the duration of his tenure. The Flames had a sub-.400 record every season over the next six years and, though they would make the CCHA tournament every year from 1991 through '95, they went 1–10 in tournament play, never making it out of the opening round. When the 1995–96 season rolled around the Flames were seven years removed from a winning season and virtually irrelevant in college hockey circles. More importantly the program had lost the university around $600,000 the year before and UIC did not have another major program to balance out the books. With the administration believing basketball to be a better investment the ice hockey program was discontinued after the season.\nUIC Hockey was broadcast from 1983-84 through the final season of 1995-96 with Les Grobstein handing play by play. Chris Madsen and John Kelley filled in when Grobstein had a conflict with UIC Basketball.\nThe Flames would return to the ice in 2004 as a club team but as of 2017 the Chicago-area and the entire state of Illinois has been left without a Division I program since the flames went belly-up.\nSeason-by-season records.\nSource:\nFlames in the NHL.\nSource:"

The eleven events took place between 8–22 February 2014.\nFor the first time ever, a mixed relay event was staged after being voted onto the Olympic program in 2011.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe following is the competition schedule for all eleven events.\nMedal summary.\nNotably absent from the medals for biathlon in the 2014 Games were the German women who had won six medals in 2006 and five in 2010. The men's team meanwhile recovered from a poor Games in Vancouver to achieve two silver medals. France's women, who had won three medals in 2010, also missed the podium, as did Canada, despite some promising performances. Sweden's men were also expected to win a medal but they too missed out.\n13 athletes went home with two or more medals with five athletes winning three medals each. Belarus's Darya Domracheva won three gold medals to be the most successful biathlete at the Games, while France's Martin Fourcade was the most successful male winning two gold and one silver medal. 2012/13 women's World Cup winner Tora Berger won a medal of each color, while team-mate Tiril Eckhoff won one gold and two bronze at her first Games. Czech athlete Ondřej Moravec won two silver and one bronze.\nThe biathlon portion was marred by German biathlete Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle's positive doping test. Sachenbacher-Stehle had finished fourth in both the mass start and the mixed relay but was disqualified from both events after testing positive for the banned substance methylhexanamine.\nOn 27 November 2017, Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova (both from Russia) were disqualified for doping violations. On 1 December 2017, their teammate Olga Zaitseva was also disqualified. On 24 September 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport removed the sanctions from Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova, but upheld them on their teammate Olga Zaitseva. Medals in the women's relay were redistributed by the IOC on 19 May 2022.\nOn 15 February 2020, it was announced that because of a doping violation Evgeny Ustyugov and Russian relay team had been disqualified from the 2014 Olympics. There is no official decision by the IOC yet.\nParticipating NOCs.\nThirty-five nations sent biathletes to compete in the events.\nQualification.\nA total quota of 220 athletes were allowed to compete at the Games (113 men and 107 women). Countries were assigned quotas using a combination of the Nation Cup scores of their top 3 athletes in the individual sprint and relay competitions at the 2012 and 2013 World Championships."

        "text": "The 2012 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2012 NRL season. Played on Sunday, 30 September at Sydney's ANZ Stadium between the minor premiers Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the second-placed Melbourne Storm. Melbourne won the match 14–4 in a tight contest to claim their second premiership title after their 2007 and 2009 titles were stripped due to major salary cap breaches.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth time the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs and Melbourne Storm have faced each other in a finals series and the first in a grand final. It was the fifth time in the past seven seasons the Melbourne Storm featured in a grand final, although they were playing for their second official title. The Canterbury side played in their first decider since 2004 when they defeated the Sydney Roosters to win their last premiership. It was also the third time coaches Craig Bellamy and Des Hasler oversaw their sides in a premiership decider after each claimed grand final success in their 2007 and 2008 meetings.\nMelbourne and Canterbury have faced each other twice in the regular season, with the Melbourne side beating Canterbury-Bankstown 12–6 in a tight match at Melbourne's home ground in AAMI Park in round 7 whilst Canterbury got over Melbourne later in round 16 with a score of 20–4 at Canterbury's non-traditional venue at Virgin Australia Stadium in Mackay, Queensland.\nTickets to the grand final were sold out by 22 August, more than two weeks before finals playoffs begun.\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nThe Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs finished first on the regular season competition ladder, claiming the 2012 minor premiership with 18 wins from 24 matches and finishing on 40 premiership points. This was the club's 7th minor premiership in its history and its first since 1994. Canterbury's 2012 season was characterised by a 12-game winning streak from round 11 to round 24, which was eventually ended after a 34–6 defeat to the Canberra Raiders in round 25. This loss gave Melbourne a chance to claim the minor premiership, however a 42–10 win over the Sydney Roosters in round 26 ensured the Canterbury club finished first.\nThe Canterbury side began the 2012 finals series with a 16–10 win over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles to ensure a preliminary final berth in week 3. They subsequently won this match 32–8 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs to qualify for the 2012 grand final against Melbourne.\nThis was Canterbury's 17th grand final appearance and the club's first since 2004.\nMelbourne Storm.\nThe Melbourne Storm finished second on the regular season competition leader just behind Canterbury-Bankstown on 38 premiership points, with 17 wins from 24 games. Melbourne's 2012 season was characterised by a 9-game winning streak from round 1 to round 9, making them early premiership favourites. The Melbourne club subsequently suffered a 5-game losing streak from round 16 to round 21, allowing Canterbury to overtake them to win the minor premiership. Despite this, the Melbourne club finished the season winning their last 5 consecutive matches to finish second.\nMelbourne began week 1 of the finals with a 24–6 victory over the South Sydney Rabbitohs to qualify for a preliminary final in week 3 against modern rivals the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Melbourne won this match 40–12 to qualify for the 2012 NRL Grand Final against Canterbury-Bankstown.\nThis was the Melbourne club's fifth grand final appearance in seven seasons and its sixth appearance overall.\nTeam lists.\nNote: Kevin Proctor swapped with Sika Manu from his interchange spot before the match.\nMatch details.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\n1st half.\nMelbourne began the first half with all the early possession, punishing a number of errors by Canterbury-Bankstown with several repeat sets. The relentless pressure was rewarded with a 7th minute try to Ryan Hoffman, bursting through a yawning gap after taking Gareth Widdop's lovely short ball 10m out from the line to make it 4–0. Melbourne captain Cameron Smith missed the conversion. Melbourne continued to pressure Canterbury's try line over the next few minutes but they held strong, forcing Melbourne to attempt a penalty conversion which was missed by Smith.\nThe Canterbury side took this as a sign of respect to their brutal defense and went on the attack, resulting in a 25th minute try to Sam Perrett, who beat Melbourne fullback Billy Slater to Krisnan Inu's perfectly placed grubber kick. As Perrett dived over, Slater accidentally barged into him in his attempts to stop the try. Inu, reacting to what he thought was an illegal play by Slater, pushed Melbourne fullback away, sparking an all in brawl which led to one of the biggest controversies in Grand Final history. Once the fight was broken up, Slater claimed that he was bitten on the ear by Canterbury prop James Graham. Video showed the fullback had blood coming from his ear and replays confirmed the allegations, clearly showing Graham biting Slater's ear. Referee Tony Archer placed the incident on report and it was referred straight to the judiciary; Graham later received a 12 match ban. The try was awarded to Perrett, however, Inu missed the conversion and the score was locked at 4-4.\nMelbourne used the controversial incident to spur them on, relaying the pressure on Canterbury. They capitalized in the 32nd minute where Melbourne halfback Cooper Cronk delivering a sublime no look pass to Slater as he burst through a gap beating two defenders to cross for Melbourne, taking the score out to 10-4 after Smith's conversion. Melbourne were not done just yet, as they delivered the knockout blow a minute before halftime where Cronk supplied a pinpoint cross field bomb to Justin O’Neil who leapt over Canterbury fullback Ben Barba to score Melbourne's third try. Smith missed the conversion once more and Melbourne led 14–4 at halftime.\n2nd half.\nThe second half was a defensive slog. Melbourne didn't touch the ball in the opening 10 minutes, holding out set after set of Canterbury's attack. Canterbury captain Michael Ennis seemed to have scored in the 49th minute only to be denied by Cameron Smith holding him up. Melbourne went down the other end and Smith missed another penalty conversion, failing in his attempts to make it a two converted try lead. The closest the Canterbury side came to scoring was in the 61st minute where Barba made a break down the left hand wing, kicked over the top to centre Josh Morris, who failed to capitalise due to the bounce of the ball and Slater's desperate defending. Melbourne prop Brian Norrie appeared to have scored a try in the 70th minute, diving over after Slater batted back Cronk's bomb, however it was to be denied as Norrie was offside. Melbourne held on to win the Grand Final 14–4. Melbourne halfback Cooper Cronk was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for his man of the match performance.\nThe crowd of 82,976 was the highest Grand Final attendance at ANZ Stadium ever since it was re-constructed in 2002 and it was the first Grand Final to have a scoreless half of play. Melbourne's 2012 triumph was their 2nd legitimate title. The result also saw Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy take home his first valid championship.\nAftermath.\nThe Melbourne Storm's premiership victory qualified them to compete against the Super League XVII champions, Leeds Rhinos in the 2013 World Club Challenge."

        "text": "John Mann (born June 27, 1985) is an American water polo player. He led the University of California team to the 2006 NCAA Championship, and he played for the United States national team at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nCareer.\nHigh school.\nMann played on the water polo team at Corona del Mar High School and won three C.I.F. titles. Starting his sophomore season, Mann began to rapidly develop as a top youth player in the country and was selected to train with the United States Olympic team shortly after his Sophomore year at Corona del Mar High. Mann attributes his growth during this time to the flexibility of his teachers and administrators allowing him to attend daily practice with the National Team at the Los Alamitos Joint training facility between 7-10 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. practice. Fortunately, Mann was able to balance the responsibilities of both school and sport through this time. Throughout his career at CdM, Mann was named Orange County player of the year multiple times. While at CdM Mann was a three-time First team All-America and was known for his goals scoring ability both in the center and on the perimeter, as a senior, he scored 109 goals and was named the Orange County Player of the Year despite missing the first month of the season due to an injury sustained in international competition in Russia. M\nCollege.\nMann then joined the University of California, Berkeley team. He scored 22 goals as a freshman in 2003. As a sophomore, he led the Bears with 60 goals, was named the team MVP, and was also a first team All-American. The following season, he scored 56 goals to lead the team again. He repeated as team MVP and was again named to the All-America first team.\nIn 2006, Mann scored a team-leading 80 goals and led California to the NCAA Championship.

He served as Team Captain between 2013 and 2015. Water polo captaincy is a rare distinction for a Center player (position) due to the constant physical contact and nature that the position requires. Typically, a perimeter player is earns the title of captain at the elite level.

Marseilles (Marseilles, France).\nIncredibly, Mann became the League champion, League Cup Champion, and Super Cup Champion of each the Brazilian, Spanish, French, and Serbian Leagues. This success further solidified Mann as one of the most accomplished and sought after U.S. players in the International Professional league system. He represented C.N. Barceloneta (Barcelona, Spain), V.K. Red Star (Belgrade, Serbia) and C.N. Marseilles (Marseilles, France) in Champions League.

        "text": "Saqlain Mushtaq, a former Pakistani cricketer, took 19 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. A five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded by cricket critics as a notable achievement, and fewer than 50 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A right-arm off break bowler who represented his country between 1995 and 2004, Saqlain was described by the BBC as \"a revolution in the art of attacking off-spin bowling\". Saqlain was named by \"Wisden\" as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 2000.\nSaqlain made his Test debut in 1995 against Sri Lanka at the Arbab Niaz Stadium, Peshawar. His first Test five-wicket haul came in 1997 against the same team at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. In January 1999 against India at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, he took a five-wicket haul in both innings of a Test match for the first time. He repeated this feat only once more in his career, at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi during the second Test of the same series. His career-best figures for an innings were 8 wickets for 164 runs against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore in November 2000. He took ten or more wickets in a match on three occasions.\nHaving made his One Day International (ODI) debut in September 1995 against Sri Lanka at the Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala, Saqlain's first ODI five-wicket haul came the following year, against New Zealand, a match Pakistan won at the same venue. His career-best bowling figures in ODI cricket were 5 wickets for 20 runs against England at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in 2000. , Saqlain is one of the four bowlers to achieve an ODI hat-trick (three wickets in consecutive deliveries) on two or more different occasions, both against Zimbabwe; one of his hat-tricks came during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Saqlain took thirteen five-wicket hauls in Test cricket and six in ODIs. , he is fourth in the list of five-wicket haul takers for Pakistan, all formats of the game combined."

        "text": "This is a recap of the 1976 season for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. It was the tour's 18th season, and consisted of 35 events. Earl Anthony added another \"first\" to his résumé, becoming the first player to win three PBA Player of the Year awards. Anthony again dominated the tour with six victories and topped the $100,000 season earnings mark for the second straight year (topping his previous record by cashing $110,808).\nAnthony, however, did not win a major title in 1976. Those titles went to Paul Moser (BPAA U.S. Open), Marshall Holman (Firestone Tournament of Champions) and Paul Colwell (Brunswick PBA National Championship). Holman (21) became the youngest Tournament of Champions winner ever with his victory, a distinction he would hold until 2016 when Swede Jesper Svensson won the ToC at age 20.\nThe lead for career PBA titles changed hands a few times during the season. Dick Weber collected his 25th career title in February to hold the lead until July, when Don Johnson also won his 25th. By the end of the season, Earl Anthony had reached 26 titles to pass both. (Weber, however, had also won four BPAA All-Star events earlier in his career. These were not counted as PBA titles at the time, but were added as titles in 2008 when the PBA amended its rules.)"

Roth won four titles on the season and made numerous other top-five finishes to lead the Tour in earnings (over $105,000). \nJohnny Petraglia captured his second career major championship, winning the BPAA U.S. Open. Additional major titles for 1977 went to Mike Berlin (Firestone Tournament of Champions) and Tommy Hudson (Columbia PBA National Championship). Don Johnson collected his 26th career title, only to be caught and tied by Dick Weber the following week when Weber won his 26th. But both were now in Earl Anthony's rearview mirror, as the legendary lefthander earned his 27th and 28th titles during the season. For Johnson, his victory in Gretna, Louisiana in February gave him at least one title every season for the last 12 seasons – at the time, a PBA record."

        "title": "Trinity–Antonian Cricket Encounter",
        "text": "The Battle of the Blues (Kandy), also referred to as the \"Trinity–Antonian Cricket Encounter\" or \"Hill Country Battle of the Blues\", stands as the sixth oldest traditional school cricket match, commonly known as a Big Match, held annually in Sri Lanka. Dating back to 1914, this encounter sees Trinity College, Kandy, and St. Anthony's College, Kandy, engage in a two-day cricket contest. The John Halangoda Memorial Trophy is bestowed upon the victor of the match, determined by either an outright win or, failing that, a first innings triumph. It is noteworthy that a first innings victory does not formally register as a win for the respective team in the records.\nFurthermore, following the conclusion of the two-day match, a limited overs encounter is typically held a week later. This series was inaugurated in 1980, and the winning team is awarded the Sir Richard Aluwihare Trophy.\nHistory.\nBoth Trinity and St. Anthony’s College embraced cricket as a sporting pursuit during the late 19th century, inaugurating their respective 1st XI programmes soon after. The initial cricket fixtures between the two institutions featured teams consisting of both staff and students. However, these early encounters are not recognised as official 1st XI inter-school matches and are consequently excluded from the schools' overall records.\nThe first official 1st XI cricket match between the schools was played in March 1914 at the Bogambara Stadium in Kandy with St. Anthony’s emerging victorious by 42 runs. C. E. de Silva captained Trinity with C. C. Senaratne captaining St. Anthony’s. Trinity won the encounter in 1915 but due to exigencies created from the ongoing World War I, the series was suspended in 1916.\nIt recommenced in 1917, which was won by St. Anthony’s. Trinity went on to record 11 consecutive victories from 1918 to 1928. During the period following the culmination of World War I, St. Anthony’s were deprived of their cricket ground and practice pitches due to the British Army occupying the land.\nA disagreement between the two schools, regarding the age rule resulted in the cancellation of the encounter in 1956 and 1957.\nIn 2001, the encounter was not contested as Trinity terminated their season early due to disciplinary reasons.\nThe centenary encounter of the series was held in 2017 with the two schools taking on each other on 10-11 March 2017 at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele.\nThe matches were postponed and eventually called off in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe trophy.\nIn 2005, a tribute was established in memory of John Halangoda, an alumnus of Trinity College who later served as a cricket coach at St. Anthony’s. This commemorative trophy, known as the John Halangoda Memorial Trophy, was introduced to honour his legacy. It is awarded to the victorious team at the conclusion of the two-day match.\nThe victors of the limited overs cricket contest are honoured with the Sir Richard Aluwihare Memorial Trophy. This award pays homage to the distinguished legacy of Sir Richard Aluwihare, the first Ceylonese Inspector General of Police and a veteran of World War I. Sir Richard Aluwihare, an alumnus of Trinity College, excelled not only as a cricket stalwart but also as the head prefect during his time at the institution.\nThe venue.\nThe two-day encounter is alternatively held at Asgiriya Stadium, which is the home ground of Trinity and St. Anthony’s College Cricket Stadium, which is the home ground of St. Anthony’s. Bogambara Stadium and Pallekele International Cricket Stadium also had been match venues in the past.\nThe same principle applies to the limited overs series as well, with the visiting team at a particular year's two-day encounter assuming the role of the host for the subsequent limited overs engagement.\nSummary of results.\nIn the 105 matches contested thus far in the two-day series, Trinity has emerged victorious 23 times, while St. Anthony’s has secured victory in 11 encounters. St. Anthony’s last secured an outright win in 1992 under the leadership of Umesh de Alwis, whereas Trinity's most recent outright victory occurred in 2012 under the captaincy of Niroshan Dickwella.\nTrinity holds the lead in the limited overs series as well with 20 victories compared to St. Anthony's record of 17 wins. Out of the 42 encounters played up to 2024, one match concluded in a tie (in 2014), while four matches were abandoned due to inclement weather conditions (in 1993, 2003, 2008, and 2023).\nList of fixtures and results.\nKey\nRecords for the two-day series.\nBatting and bowling records.\n\"Source: Trinity Antonian Encounters – A Statistical Analysis\"\nRecords for the limited overs series.\nBatting and bowling records.\n\"Source: The Trinity-Antonian Limited Overs Series in Numbers\""

Garcia pitched for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball in 2012.\nEarly life.\nGarcia attended Gulliver Preparatory School in Coral Gables, Florida. He played for the school's baseball team as a catcher and committed to attend the University of South Carolina on a baseball scholarship, intending to play for the South Carolina Gamecocks. He was a switch-hitting catcher as well as pitcher.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe New York Yankees drafted Garcia in the third round, with the 99th overall selection, of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, and he made his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL) with the GCL Yankees. One of the top prospects in the GCL in 2004, Garcia was promoted to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Single–A South Atlantic League in 2005. After returning to Charleston in 2006, the Yankees assigned him to the West Oahu CaneFires of the Arizona Fall League after the 2006 season.\nGarcia experienced a torn ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow, which required Tommy John surgery in 2007. After missing the entire 2007 season, Garcia pitched to a 4–4 win–loss record and a 4.33 earned run average (ERA) with 74 strikeouts in innings pitched between the GCL Yankees, Tampa Yankees of the High–A Florida State League, and Trenton Thunder of Double–A Eastern League in 2008.\nOn November 20, 2008, the Yankees added Garcia to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Garcia experienced a recurrence of pain in his right elbow, which required his second elbow surgery, to repair a bone spur. His UCL tore again in 2010, which required his second Tommy John surgery in April 2010. The Yankees released him on May 14, 2010.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn August 1, 2011, Garcia signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals organization. In 2012, he allowed only five earned runs in 45 appearances, for a combined ERA of 0.86 for the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League and Syracuse Chiefs of the Triple–A International League. On September 3, 2012, Garcia was promoted to the major leagues for the first time. The following day, he made his major league debut, inducing a pop-up to end an inning. Nationals manager Davey Johnson said on September 24 that the team may attempt to convert Garcia into a starter for the 2013 season, citing his fully developed repertoire of pitches.\nGarcia spent most of the 2013 season on the disabled list with a torn wrist tendon, shoulder and hamstring injuries, with minor league rehab assignments at Single–A Potomac, Double–A Harrisburg, and Triple–A Syracuse.\nGarcia was released by the Nationals on June 25, 2014.\nPitching style.\nGarcia threw four pitches: a four-seam and two-seam fastball averaging about 96 mph, a sweeping knuckle curveball in the low 80s, and a changeup averaging about 87 mph. Garcia said he was inspired to learn the spike curveball grip from watching Mike Mussina pitch."

In the Rugby-Bundesliga, the first division, ten teams played a home-and-away season with semi-finals and a final between the top four teams at the end. The season started on 27 August 2010 and finished with the championship final on 5 May 2012, interrupted by a winter break from mid-December to late February. The league's top try scorer was Caine Elisara for the second year running while Luke James Muggeridge took out the honours of best points scorer for the first time. Both are from New Zealand and played for Heidelberger RK.\nThe league was won by Heidelberger RK who defeated TV Pforzheim 20-16 to earn its third consecutive title. TV Pforzheim played in its first-ever German championship final, having defeated SC 1880 Frankfurt 46–25 in the semi-finals. Frankfurt had played in the previous five finals and won the championship in 2008 and 2009. The second semi-final was played between \"HRK\" and SC Neuenheim with the former winning 71–21.\nIn the second tier, the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga, FC St. Pauli Rugby and the reserve team of SC 1880 Frankfurt took out the division titles, with SC 1880 Frankfurt II taking out the overall title with a 32–22 finals victory.\nBoth divisions of the 2nd Bundesliga played with only nine instead of ten clubs. The South/West division lost RG Heidelberg II just before the start of the season when the club decided to withdraw its reserve team to the third division while the reserve team of Berliner Rugby Club was withdrawn during the season. RU Hohen Neuendorf was expulsed from the league during the season for falling to field in two games without adequate excuse. TSV Handschuhsheim II was punished the same way for the same reason after the season had ended, with both of the teams being relegated.\nIn mid-July 2012 the \"Deutsche Rugby Tag\", the annual general meeting of the \"DRV\" decided to approve a league reform proposed by German international Manuel Wilhelm. The new system will see the number of clubs in the Bundesliga increased from ten to 24 in 2012–13, the league divided into four regional divisions of six clubs each and the finals series expanded from four to eight teams. One of the main aims of the reform was to reduce the number of kilometres traveled by individual teams and therefore reduce the travel expenses. Additionally, the 2nd Bundesliga would be expanded to 24 teams.\nBundesliga table.\nThe final standings in the table:\nBundesliga results.\nThe results of the Bundesliga in 2011–12:\nPlayer statistics.\nTry scorers.\nThe leading try scores in the 2011–12 Rugby-Bundesliga season were (10 tries or more):\nPoint scorers.\nThe leading point scores in the 2011–12 Rugby-Bundesliga season were (100 points or more):\nPer club.\nThe top try and point scorers per club were:\n2nd Bundesliga tables.\nSouth/West.\nThe final standings in the table:\nNorth/East.\nThe final standings in the table:"

        "text": "Season Ticket Basketball 2003 is a basketball management simulation video game developed by Brian Nichols and published by Infogrames.\nGameplay.\nContrary to many sports video games, where the player controls athletes who compete in the sport, \"Season Ticket Basketball 2003\" puts the player in the role of the franchise owner. The sport itself is not played, but rather, aspects of the business side of the sport are decided upon. The game allowed the player to run as many franchises as desired for an indefinite number of seasons as well as the importing of images into the game as team logos. Also, the game allowed multiple saved leagues at once and its season process included an all-star game, a draft, and a playoff for the league championship. Along with the various customization options provided to the player, there is an exhibition game mode where the player can go against the computer or simulate a game without actually witnessing the game unfold on-screen.\nReception.\nThe game received a score of 8.1 from GameSpot, concluding that \"Few games of this type are so fulfilling, so lovingly designed with a real appreciation for both the sport in question and for sensible user interfaces. Solid play, authentic number crunching, dedication to the fine details, and online league support make this one of the best sports management titles on the market.\""

        "title": "Para-equestrian",
        "text": "Para-equestrian is an equestrian sport governed by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI), and includes two competitive events: One is para-equestrian dressage, which is conducted under the same basic rules as conventional dressage, but with riders divided into different competition grades based on their functional abilities. The other is para-equestrian driving, which operates under the same basic rules as combined driving but places competitors in various grades based on their functional abilities.\nHistory.\nThe first official Paralympic Games was held in Rome in 1960. The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Games, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics. Competitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympic games for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, all disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the International Paralympic Committee, with classification being done based on functional disability type.\nPara-equestrian dressage was added to the Paralympic Games program at the 1996 Summer Paralympics. The FEI brought para-equestrian sport under its umbrella in 2006. Riders with physical disabilities may compete on the same team as people with vision impairment.\nEvents.\nThere are two separate para-equestrian events sanctioned by FEI, the sport's governing body. They are para-dressage and para-driving.\nPara-dressage.\nDressage events include \"Walk Only Tests\" for Grade 1, with trot work allowed in freestyle, and \"Walk and Trot tests\" for Grade 2. The dressage events open to Grade 3 classification included \"Walk and Trot but Canter allowed in Freestyle\". The dressage events open to Grade 4 classification included \"Walk, Trot and Canter and may show lateral work in Freestyle\". In these three grades, participants use a 40 x 20 metre arena. The dressage events open to Grade 5 classification included \"Walk, Trot, Canter, Canter Half-Pirouettes, 3 and 4 sequence changes and lateral work.\" At Grade 5 participants move up to the 60 x 20 metre arena. All class events are mixed gendered.\nFor national team competitions such as the Paralympics, each team consists of three riders, one of whom must be a Grade 1, Grade 2 or Grade 3 rider. , people with physical and visual disabilities are eligible to compete.\nPara-driving.\nThe other para-equestrian event is para-driving. It was previously called Carriage Driving. All class events are mixed gendered.\nEquipment.\nThe sport is the one with one of the highest rates of injury and illness among all Paralympic sports. For this reason, much of the equipment for the sport is developed with this in mind. Much of the equipment uses Velcro and rubber bands so that things can easily breakaway and protect the rider during a fall. There is also a constant balance in developing equipment for para-equestrian to assure that the rider remains in control, and that they are not dragged along by the horse. One of the adaptions made to saddles for para-equestrian is extra padding. One of the companies that specializes in making saddles for people with disabilities is Superacor, Inc. In addition to saddles, para-equestrian riders may use some other form of padding such as a fleece covering for the saddle.\nPara-equestrian competitors have both a class and a disability profile number. The profile number impacts which equipment a rider can use, with equipment differences existing in the same class.\nMajor competitions.\nParalympic Games.\nThe Paralympic games host a para-equestrian dressage competition, and have done so since 1996. The Paralympic Games are the second largest equestrian event in the world, only behind the Olympic Games.\nIt is the only sport on the Paralympic program that includes a live animal.\nMedia depiction.\nHistorically, para-equestrian riders have been treated by the media as \"super-crips\". Media coverage suggests that these riders excel at their sport despite the fact that they have a disability. Their riding abilities are rarely considered on their own merits given their disability type. When pictured in media reports, they are rarely depicted in competition on their horses. Instead, they are depicted in tack rooms, outside of a competitive setting.\nIn able-bodied equestrian.\nLiz Hartel was 1952 Summer Olympics competitor who was post polio and had a disability. She won a silver at those Games in the dressage competition.\nPara-equestrian competitors, such as gold medalist Lee Pearson, have expressed frustration when competing against able-bodied competitors because these able-bodied competitors often do not want to compete in the same class as some one with a disability.\nPara-equestrian classification.\nThe classification system for para-equestrian sport is a graded system based on the degree of physical or visual disability and handled at the international level by the FEI. The sport has eligible classifications for people with physical and vision disabilities. The sport is open to competitors with impaired muscle power, athetosis, impaired passive range of movement, hypertonia, limb deficiency, ataxia, leg length difference, short stature, and vision impairment. They are grouped into five different classes to allow fair competition. These classes are Grade I, Grade II, Grade III, Grade IV and Grade V. The para-equestrian classification does not consider the gender of the rider, as equestriennes compete in mixed gender competitions. Internationally, classification is handled by FEI.\nHistory.\nIn 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. The system used for equestrian by the CP-ISRA was originally created for field athletics events.\nBecause of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations, in this case FEI, to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. The fourth edition of FEI's classification system guide was published in January 2015.\nClassification process and governance.\nClassification at the national level is handled by different organizations. For example, Australian para-equestrian sport and classification is managed by the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nDuring classification, classifiers look at several things including a rider's mobility, strength and coordination. After riders are classified, they are giving both a classification and a profile. This profile a number 1 to 39 for para-dressage and 1 to 32 for para-driving. This profile impacts what adaptive equipment riders can use.\nPara-dressage classification.\nPara-dressage has five different classes: Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4 and Grade 5\nThe FEI defines this classification as \"Grade I. At this level the rider will ride a walk only test. Grade 2, the rider will ride walk with some trot work excluding medium trot.\" Federation Equestre International defines Grade 3 as \"At this level the rider will ride a novice level test excluding canter.\" Federation Equestre International defines Grade 4 as \"At this level the rider will ride a novice level test.\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade 4: Athletes with a physical disability or vision impairment. Riders with moderate unilateral impairment, moderate impairment in four limbs or severe arm impairment. In day to day life, riders are usually ambulant but some may use a wheelchair for longer distances or due to lack of stamina. Riders with a vision impairment who compete in this class have total loss of sight in both eyes (B1).\" Federation Equestre International defines Grade 5 as \"At this level the rider will ride an elementary/medium level test\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade V:, Athletes with a physical disability or vision impairment. Riders have a physical impairment in one or two limbs (for example limb loss or limb deficiency), or some degree of visual impairment (B2).\"\nPara-driving classification.\nPara-driving utilizes a different classification system than para-dressage events, and includes only two classes: Grade I and Grade II. Grade 1 is for people who use a wheelchair on a daily basis, and have limited trunk functionality and impairments in their upper limbs. It also includes people who have the ability to walk but have impairments in all of their limbs. The third class of riders it includes is people with severe arm impairments Grade II is for riders who are higher functioning than Grade I riders but who would otherwise be at disadvantage when competing against able-bodied competitors."

His great grandfather was Wiremu Kingi.\nPlaying career.\nMcLeod played for Taranaki and Auckland. He was originally a rugby union player for the Star club in Taranaki but switched codes at the end of the 1932 season to join the Taranaki team which played the Marist Old Boys club side from Auckland which featured 6 New Zealand internationals at Pukekura Park. He transferred from Taranaki in 1937 and joined the Richmond Rovers club. While there McLeod was selected for the New Zealand national rugby league team in 1937, playing against Australia. Four days after the 1937 test, McLeod was part of the New Zealand Māori side that defeated Australia 16-5. He was surprisingly omitted from the second test team to Play Australia days after the New Zealand Māori win.\nHe toured Australia with New Zealand in 1938 however no test matches were played on the tour. He played in 7 of the 9 tour matches. The first at hooker against New South Wales, with the remainder in the second row. He then played for New Zealand in their match against Auckland following their return.\nLegacy.\nIn 2008 he was named in the Taranaki Rugby League Team of the Century."

        "text": "The 2012 Vuelta a España began on 18 August, and stage 11 occurred on 29 August. The 2012 edition began with a team time trial stage – where each member of a team started together racing against the clock – in Pamplona, Navarre with the race remaining in Spain until the finish to the eighth stage, with a summit finish at the Collada de la Gallina in Andorra. After the ninth stage, the race's first rest day saw the riders travel across Spain by air from Barcelona to Ponteareas; a road stage was followed by the only individual time trial of the race, where each remaining member of the starting peloton of 198 riders competed against the clock.\nThe were the winners of the race-opening team time trial, recording a time ten seconds quicker than any other squad; their first rider to cross the line, Jonathan Castroviejo, became the first race leader as a result. He maintained his lead through the first mass-start stage the following day – the first of four stage victories for German sprinter John Degenkolb, who also won stages 5, 7 and 10 – but lost the lead following the first summit finish of the race in Eibar. The \"rojo\" jersey remained within the team however, as Alejandro Valverde picked up the race lead after pipping Joaquim Rodríguez in a photo-finish at the stage end. Valverde gave up the lead the following day, after crashing with several other members of his team just as the peloton's pace was being increased by the team on the front, . As a result, Valverde apportioned blame to , while his team manager, at one point, pulled alongside his opposite number from for discussions. Rodríguez assumed the lead of the race then, but held a marginal one-second lead ahead of Chris Froome.\nThere were no changes in the classification until another summit finish on the sixth stage, when Rodríguez and Froome were the two contenders for the stage victory. Froome had attacked to bring himself and Rodríguez, but a second attack from Rodríguez brought him clear, and with time bonuses on the line, extended his lead to ten seconds. In Andorra, it again came down to the main favourites for the race; for a time, Alberto Contador attacked off the front and maintained a lead of around ten seconds – looking for his first victory since his return from a doping ban – before tying up and Valverde and Rodríguez beat him to the line, with Froome having cracked further back. Rodríguez put another twenty seconds into his lead the following day after attacking on the final climb, and his advantage of around a minute prior to the individual time trial was sufficient for him to maintain the lead after the stage; he put in the seventh-fastest time on the stage to keep the leader's jersey, but by only a second from Contador, who moved ahead of Froome in the classification. As a result, Rodríguez topped the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Vuelta still to race.\nStage 1.\nFor the third year in succession, the Vuelta began with a team time trial; on this occasion, it began in the Navarre city of Pamplona, hosting the Vuelta for the first time since 1994 when France's Laurent Jalabert won the thirteenth stage of that year's race. The stage itself was in and around Pamplona, with the final kilometre of the stage following the route of the Running of the Bulls, held as part of the festival of San Fermín the month before. Just like the bull-run, the stage finished in the middle of the Plaza de Toros, the city's main bullring. were the first of the race's 22 squads to begin the stage, wearing a different team kit to normal; having received dispensation from the Union Cycliste Internationale, the team wore white and red skin-suits instead of their customary green. However, with a time of 20' 18\", the squad ultimately finished the stage in last place.\nThe teams entered the course at four-minute intervals; were the second team in and comfortably lowered the earlier benchmark, recording a time almost a minute quicker. , who won the team time trial in May's Giro d'Italia, were also setting a good time on course before a crash took down three of the team's riders, and delayed Andrew Talansky, the team's main general classification contender. were the next team to top the timesheets, setting a time of 19' 01\" for the course, which held for some time. started the stage slowly but a strong second half of the course pulled them into contention for stage honours, and ultimately edged out by a small margin. They were followed by , who also recorded a time of 19' 01\", despite team members Tony Martin and Grand Tour debutant Zdeněk Štybar being led off course by a motorcycle. However, they were marginally quicker than both and .\nIt was not until the final team to start the stage that the time – and the 19-minute barrier – was beaten. had the honour of starting last due to Juan José Cobo – the winner of the 2011 edition of the race for – being amongst their nine riders. The team were only two seconds slower than to the intermediate time-check, kept their pace up and recorded a time of 18' 51\" for the course, to record the first Grand Tour team time trial victory for a Spanish squad in nine years. As the first rider to cross the line, Jonathan Castroviejo assumed the first red jersey of the race for the general classification leader, with four of his teammates in the same time and Cobo in sixth place, having been distanced, by four seconds, in the closing metres.\nStage 2.\nThe opening road stage of the 2012 Vuelta saw the riders head south from Pamplona, via a loop around Tafalla – where the race's first intermediate sprint point was held – and the first categorised climb, the third-category Alto de la Chapela, before heading towards Viana. In Viana itself, there was an intermediate sprint point on the first passage through the town, before the finish second time around. With most of the parcours being flat, it was expected to ultimately result in a sprint finish at the stage end. Three riders – Spanish pairing Javier Aramendia of and rider Javier Chacón, along with Mikhail Ignatiev () – went clear around after the start of the stage, making the early breakaway from the field, and the trio managed to extend their advantage over the main field to around five minutes. Niki Terpstra had also been a part of the breakaway at one point, but as he trailed overnight leader Jonathan Castroviejo of the by just ten seconds, the breakaway were not allowed to gain a substantial advantage at that point. Terpstra ultimately dropped back into the main field to allow the gap to increase.\nBetween the lead trio, they swept up most of the available points on offer at the two intermediate sprint positions, while Chacón assumed the first blue-and-white polka-dot jersey for the mountains classification but only after Aramendia was assumed to have sprinted irregularly while crossing the summit of the third-category Alto de la Chapela first. Having guaranteed a jersey at the end of the day, Chacón dropped back with around remaining, when the gap to the main field was around a minute; Alberto Contador () took two bonus seconds for third at the intermediate sprint point in Viana, moving level with his main general classification rival Chris Froome, of . Ignatiev and Aramendia were brought back several kilometres later, and despite several late attacks, the expected sprint finish materialised where sprinter John Degenkolb took his first Grand Tour stage victory, beating 's Allan Davis and Froome's teammate Ben Swift to the line. Castroviejo maintained his overall lead by finishing with the peloton, although he was not confident of keeping it, while Chacón added the white combination jersey to his mountains lead and Degenkolb took the points lead with his stage win.\nStage 3.\nAlthough there were four categorised climbs over the parcours, the final climb of the day – the first-category Alto de Arrate – was the key point of the stage. Frequently used in the Tour of the Basque Country stage race held in the spring, the Alto de Arrate climb with a gradient in places at over 11%, crested out with around remaining of the stage, before a false flat to the finish line. With three-time Arrate winner Samuel Sánchez not competing in the Vuelta, 's Joaquim Rodríguez – second in Eibar, in 2012 – was regarded as one of the stage favourites along with rider Alejandro Valverde and Alberto Contador of .\nThe day's breakaway was made up of eight riders, who all moved ahead of the main field inside the opening of the stage. The octet managed to establish a lead of almost four-and-a-half minutes, despite one of its members – 's Philippe Gilbert, still winless for the year – being just ten seconds behind the leader of the general classification, Valverde's teammate Jonathan Castroviejo. At each of the three categorised climbs prior to the finishing climb, Pim Ligthart of took maximum points on offer, leading from Gilbert at two of them, while Nico Sijmens () crossed the third climb, the Puerto de Campazar, behind Ligthart and ahead of Gilbert. The lead group started to splinter with around , with the peloton's pace being set by the and squads, bringing the gap under a minute.\nThe latter team's Niki Terpstra was first to make a move on the Alto de Arrate, but was quickly closed down before he could establish any substantial headway off the front of the peloton. maintained their position at the front, setting the pace for Contador, and were joined at the front by . Valverde was the first of the favourites to attack from the rapidly diminishing lead group, with Contador jumping onto his wheel with Rodríguez and 's Chris Froome eventually rejoining their fellow contenders. Contador then launched several more attacks – seven in all – as the lead quartet moved their way up the climb, but each time, the other three riders in the group were able to come back to him. Valverde and Rodríguez contested the sprint for the line, with Valverde taking his sixth career Vuelta stage win in a photo-finish, after Rodríguez free-wheeled in the closing metres; a move that left him furious post-stage. Valverde took the lead in the general, points and combination classifications, while Ligthart took the mountains lead.\nStage 4.\nFresh from the punchy finish in Eibar the previous day, the race moved out of the Basque Country and headed towards the ski resort at Valdezcaray; the stage itself finished at the base of the resort – coming at above sea level – via a first-category climb of in length, at an average gradient of 5.2%, although reaching 9% in places at the lower slopes of the climb. The primary breakaway of the stage was formed early in the stage, when a wave of five riders went clear. Simon Clarke () was joined in the breakaway by 's Tony Martin and Assan Bazayev of , as well as two riders representing UCI Professional Continental Teams; Luis Ángel Maté for and rider Jesús Rosendo, with the quintet quickly gaining a substantial advantage over the main field, as they were over nine minutes clear after , and eventually established a maximum lead of just under 14 minutes.\nWith the leaders extending their lead to an insurmountable margin, the general classification contenders were looking to avoid any particular trouble during the parcours of in length. However, just after the field had passed through the town of Haro, the crosswinds that had set the course of the day played a factor in a crash. Just as Juan Antonio Flecha had accelerated on the front for , most of the hit the tarmac, including the race leader Alejandro Valverde. After the stage, Valverde criticised and blamed them for the incident. At one point, Valverde's team manager Eusebio Unzué, pulled up alongside the car for a discussion with their sporting director Nicolas Portal.\nThe ramping up of the pace had split the peloton into echelons on the road, with as many as five diagonal lines of riders seconds apart from one another. World time trial champion Martin attacked his companions at the bottom of the final climb, and took Clarke with him, as the other three riders could not follow the higher pace. As it transpired, Clarke had the stronger finish, and ultimately took his first professional victory on the line. Bazayev finished third, while the peloton came in over a minute behind Clarke; Valverde lost almost a minute beyond that, and surrendered the overall lead to 's Joaquim Rodríguez, who held a one-second advantage over Flecha's teammate Chris Froome. Clarke assumed the lead of both the points and mountains classifications.\nStage 5.\nFollowing two consecutive summit finishes, before another one in the succeeding stage of the race, the fifth stage of the race was a circuit race around the city of Logroño in the La Rioja region. Over the itinerary for the stage, a loop of was completed eight times, with intermediate sprint points being held on the Avenida de la Paz, in the city. The sprint points were held prior to the conclusion of the third and fifth laps, although it was widely expected that the stage would end up in a sprint finish. rider Javier Chacón broke away from the rest of the field almost from the start of the stage, and managed to get clear without the help of a breakaway companion. The main field decided not to follow him closely to begin with, as he was not a factor in the overall classification; over 26 minutes behind overnight leader Joaquim Rodríguez of .\nAfter a quarter of the stage, Chacón held a maximum lead of almost 12 minutes over the rest of the field, but started to lift the pace in the peloton in the long bid to bring back Chacón. With added help from the teammates of Rodríguez, the peloton had reduced Chacón's advantage to around four-and-a-half minutes at the midpoint of the stage. He was ultimately brought back to the main field with just under of the stage remaining. The final lap of the circuit saw many of the sprint trains head towards the front of the group; under the \"flamme rouge\", it was – for Daniele Bennati – and Gianni Meersman's outfit, that were at the head of proceedings with close behind. Bennati launched his sprint first, but with help from teammate Simon Geschke, John Degenkolb followed Bennati for a time before sprinting past him and won his second stage of the race by around half a bike length. Meersman completed the top three of the stage results, as Rodríguez maintained his overall lead.\nStage 6.\nThe sixth stage of the race was a return to the mountains and the emphasis was shifted away from the sprinters to the general classification contenders, in light of the two punchy, categorised climbs within the final of the day's stage. Following a lengthy descent from the third-category climb of the Puerto del Oroel, the riders had to contend with the Fuerte del Rapitán into Jaca; although relatively short at just long, the climb had an average gradient of 5.4%. After the usual manic start to the day's proceedings on the road, it was a five-rider breakaway that was established at around the point of the stage. The riders in question were either Dutch or Belgian; rider Martijn Maaskant, Joost van Leijen of and 's Pieter Weening representing the former country, and 's Kristof Vandewalle and Thomas De Gendt () representing the latter.\nDe Gendt, who was third at May's Giro d'Italia, was the best-placed rider out of the quintet in 60th place overall overnight, but he trailed the leader Joaquim Rodríguez by over seven minutes. Despite this, the lead group was allowed to establish a maximum lead of over four minutes around two-thirds into the stage, before Rodriguez's squad as well as the team in support of their team leader Alejandro Valverde started to bring them back. After van Leijen was dropped with around to go, De Gendt soon set off on his own to attempt a solo bid for victory; ultimately, he was caught before the final climb, after his near 50-second lead was negated. The pace set by the dwindled numbers considerably on the Fuerte del Rapitán before moved forward with Columbians Rigoberto Urán and Sergio Henao to protect Chris Froome. After Urán took to the front inside the final kilometre, Froome was first to attack, with only Rodríguez able to respond; Rodríguez himself kicked for the line from out, and with no response from Froome, he soon moved clear to take his fifth stage win at the Vuelta – having predicted that the climb would make \"sparks fly\" the previous day – and extended his overall lead to ten seconds over Froome.\nStage 7.\nThe day's stage was entirely situated within the autonomous community of Aragon, starting in the city of Huesca before heading south towards the outskirts of Alcañiz and the Motorland Aragón circuit, which has hosted several motorsport championship events since being opened in 2009. The finish of the stage itself came on the start-finish straight of the track, having completed almost one lap of the circuit. Despite the parcours of the stage being undulating, there were no categorised climbs during the stage, with the day's two intermediate sprint points both coming inside the final of the stage. As a result, the stage was again suited towards the sprinters due to the circuit's wide, sweeping bends.\nFour riders – Javier Aramendia (), 's Pablo Lechuga, Bert-Jan Lindeman of and rider František Raboň – provided the breakaway for the day, moving away from the rest of the field after only of racing. They established a maximum advantage of around five minutes in the opening half of the stage, providing no threat to the overall lead of Joaquim Rodríguez () as Lechuga was best-placed at over 26 minutes behind. However, Lechuga was the first of the lead quartet to be dropped as the peloton started to bring the leaders back with around remaining. The breakaway was eventually halted halfway towards the finish, and it eventually resulted in a sprint finish at the circuit, despite trying to break the peloton, with Chris Froome, Ian Stannard and Ben Swift being part of a six-rider group off the front of the field. Ultimately, points leader John Degenkolb continued his good form in the sprint finishes, taking his third stage victory of the week, after a lead-out from teammate Koen de Kort. Rodríguez maintained his overall lead of the race, by ten seconds, over Froome.\nStage 8.\nThe only stage finish outside of Spain in this year's Vuelta, the eighth stage saw the peloton head north from the start city of Lleida in Catalonia towards the Catalan-speaking microstate of Andorra. After carrying out a loop around the capital Andorra la Vella, via the second intermediate sprint point – the first coming just before the border between Spain and Andorra, in the town of La Seu d'Urgell – and the second-category climb of the Alto de la Comella. After several kilometres of descending, the first-category Collada de la Gallina awaited the riders; the climb had an average gradient of 8% – with the gradient reaching 15% in certain places of the climbs – while there were also 18 hairpin bends on the climb, drawing comparisons to Alpe d'Huez, where that climb has 21 such corners.\nHelped by a tailwind, the peloton covered over in the first hour of racing, and it was not until nearly halfway into the stage that the breakaway for the day was formed. Six riders – rider Javier Aramendia (for the second day running), 's Martijn Keizer, Cameron Meyer of , rider Javier Ramírez, 's Amaël Moinard and Mickaël Buffaz of – went clear and achieved a maximum lead of around nine-and-a-half minutes but hit the bottom of the Collada de la Gallina, with the exception of Keizer and Aramendia, who had been dropped, with a lead of around two-and-a-half minutes over the peloton led by . Moinard was dropped in the early stages of the climb, while Meyer launched an attack on his own. Meyer was eventually caught by the top four overall and Daniel Moreno (), who had all broken clear of the main field.\nMoreno and Meyer fell away from the group, and it was left to the quartet to battle it out. Froome launched an attack from the front just inside the final kilometre, but was quickly covered by his three Spanish rivals; however, Alberto Contador of launched his own counter-attack having brought Froome back. He held an advantage of several seconds in the closing stages, but he started to slow within sight of the finish line. Froome had been left behind by the other two riders in contention – 's race leader Joaquim Rodríguez and Alejandro Valverde of the – and the pairing caught Contador out of the final corner, with Valverde taking his second stage victory of the race, just ahead of Rodríguez and Contador. Froome crossed the line fifteen seconds in arrears, which combined with eight bonus seconds gained by Rodríguez at the line, gave Rodríguez a 33-second lead over Froome; although Rodríguez remained pessimistic about his chances overall. Valverde took the blue polka-dot jersey for mountains classification leader, by winning the stage.\nStage 9.\nThe final stage before the race's first rest day saw the riders return to Spanish soil, after its finish in Andorra the previous day. The parcours was gradually downhill from the start, except for two third-category climbs along the route; the second of which, came within the final of the stage. With the stage finish in Barcelona, the race returned to the city for the first time since 1999, when a strike by riders over stage conditions reduced the fourteenth stage of that year's race by . The finish itself came at Montjuïc – near the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys – which was used for the last Grand Tour stage to finish in the city, when Thor Hushovd won the sixth stage of the 2009 Tour de France.\nAlmost immediately after the peloton rolled out of the start, the breakaway was formed by four riders. For the second day in succession, rider Mickaël Buffaz was among the leaders, and he was joined by rider Bert-Jan Lindeman, Martijn Maaskant of and, for the third time in the Vuelta, 's Javier Chacón. They managed to gather up a lead of almost five-and-a-half minutes during the early kilometres of the stage before they were gradually brought back by the main field. Despite the best efforts by the leaders to prolong their stay out front, they were caught with around remaining. Chacón's teammate Jesús Rosendo went on an immediate counter-attack, but he too could not stay clear over the field. Rosendo ultimately crashed after being absorbed back into the main field, and had to wait for his front wheel to be changed.\nBack at the front, the field remained together on the run into Barcelona, with the teams of the general classification contenders – , and – heading the field as they did so. Alberto Contador attacked prior to the Alto de Montjuïc, but could not get clear enough for the attack to stick. However, a planned attack by 's Alessandro Ballan gained more headway, with race leader Joaquim Rodríguez chasing him down. Ballan's teammate Philippe Gilbert set off in chase of Rodríguez, with the two riders joining together prior to the top of the climb. Gilbert and Rodríguez managed to remain off the front of the field by several seconds, and Gilbert took the stage honours for his first victory of the season, ahead of Rodríguez. With eight bonus seconds on the line, Rodríguez put around twenty seconds into his rivals, with his overall lead over Chris Froome increasing to fifty-three seconds, heading into the rest day.\nStage 10.\nHaving transferred from the easternmost point of the race, in Barcelona, the Vuelta recommenced after the rest day, in the town of Ponteareas in the west of Spain – a transfer of some in distance, the third-furthest transfer in the race's history – with a near-flat itinerary. There was only one categorised climb during the stage, coming after only at the third-category Alto de San Cosme, with its summit coming above sea level. The riders also had to complete a circuit of around before the finish in Sanxenxo. The flat parcours made it ideal for another sprint finish, as 's John Degenkolb looked to regain the points classification lead from race leader Joaquim Rodríguez of .\n's Javier Aramendia once again took up a position in the breakaway of a stage, and was joined out front by the most combative rider of the 2011 edition of the race, Adrián Palomares, representing the team. The duo managed to establish a maximum lead of around seven minutes at one point during the stage, before the rest of the field gradually brought the time gap down. They managed to survive off the front until the finishing circuit, where they were brought back around a quarter of the way around the lap. The sprinters' teams moved forward towards the end of the lap, where , and all looked to set it up for their respective sprinters. Ultimately, it was Degenkolb that was able to out-sprint his rivals – despite having to launch his sprint earlier than he wanted – to take his fourth stage victory of the race, becoming the first rider to do so since countryman André Greipel in 2009. Degenkolb finished ahead of 's Nacer Bouhanni and rider Daniele Bennati.\nStage 11.\nThe only individual time trial stage of the Vuelta, the halfway point was marked with an itinerary of , with the parcours split into three distinct sections; the first section was relatively flat all the way from the start in Cambados, to the intermediate time-check at the point of the stage, just outside the town of Barrantes. The second consisted of a long, 4.4% average gradient climb of the third-category Alto Monte Castrove, where points for the mountains classification were on offer for the top three riders to that point, before the descent down to Pontevedra. As was customary of time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage. Thus, Joost van Leijen of , who, in 193rd place – of the 198 riders who started the race – trailed overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez () by one hour, thirty-eight minutes and fifty-seven seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.\nVan Leijen was not the first rider to finish the course however, as Rodríguez's teammate Mikhail Ignatiev was the first to do so. Ignatiev, who started three minutes after van Leijen, at one-minute intervals, ultimately recorded a time of 58' 55\" for the course, a time which held for around ten minutes until rider Martijn Maaskant lowered the best time by over a minute. 's Jonathan Castroviejo was next to hold top spot, beating Maaskant's time by over three minutes as he completed the course in a time of 54' 10\". It was not until Cameron Meyer started 45 minutes later for that has time was threatened, with the former track world champion eventually recording a time of 53' 53\". Meyer's time was good enough to not be beaten by the current world champion Tony Martin (), but his countryman Richie Porte did eventually slip underneath that time, moving quickest by just two seconds for , before the stage-winning performance was completed by rider Fredrik Kessiakoff. Kessiakoff, the time trial winner at the Tour de Suisse in June, beat Porte's time at the respective time-points, and ultimately beat his time by a minute and a quarter.\nKessiakoff's time of 52' 36\" was not breached by anybody else to start the stage, and enabled him to take his second time trial win of the season. In the battle for overall honours, Rodríguez was able to maintain his lead in the general classification standings despite losing time to all of his rivals. Alejandro Valverde () had been the first of the contenders to start, and he also put in a solid time trial performance with a time of 53' 44\", a time that was eventually good enough for fourth on the final stage results. Chris Froome () had been expected to win the stage, but could only record a time of 53' 15\"; as a result, he lost second place overall to 's Alberto Contador, who, apart from Kessiakoff, was the only other rider to record under 53 minutes for the course with a time of 52' 53\", 17 seconds down on Kessiakoff. Rodríguez, who thought he would lose his race lead during the stage, managed to hold on by a solitary second after completing the course with the seventh-fastest time of 53' 52\", labelling his performance as a \"big step forward\"."

        "title": "2013 FIA World Endurance Championship",
        "text": "The 2013 FIA World Endurance Championship season was the second season of the FIA World Endurance Championship auto racing series, co-organized by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series was open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-style racing cars meeting four ACO categories. World Championships were awarded to drivers and to LMP1 category manufacturers, and several World Cups and Endurance Trophies were awarded for the series' other categories. The eight race championship began in April at the Silverstone Circuit and ended in November at the Bahrain International Circuit. The season was marred by the death of Allan Simonsen in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nCalendar.\nAn initial calendar was published by the FIA World Motor Sport Council on 28 September 2012. Seven of the eight races on the schedule are carried over from 2012, although several events have had their dates changed. The 6 Hours of Silverstone now begins the season in April before Spa in May and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June. In order to save costs and utilize shipping by sea instead of air, the non-European events have all been grouped at the end of the season. São Paulo remains as the first post-European event, while the new 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas replaces the 12 Hours of Sebring as the American round of the series. Fuji and Shanghai are moved forward on the calendar, leaving Bahrain to now close the season in November, allowing cooler temperatures than its September date in 2012.\nThe Silverstone race weekend was shared with the European Le Mans Series, while the Austin weekend was held in conjunction with the American Le Mans Series, although unlike the 2012 12 Hours of Sebring, both series ran separate races.\nRegulation changes.\nAn additional World Cup was awarded for the 2013 season, with drivers in both LMGTE categories having a unified championship. Further, the LMP2 and LMGTE Am categories had FIA Endurance Trophies awarded for their drivers. The qualifying format of the race weekend was also changed, with teams requiring two drivers each to set two timed laps. The qualifying results were determined based on an average of the four total laps. The new qualifying format has been met with much criticism from drivers. The pre-race warm-up session has also been eliminated from the series, except in instances where extra practice may be necessary.\nThe LMP2 category saw several rule changes in order to lower costs, including the issuing of balance of performance updates during the course of the season. A limit was also set on the price of upgrade kits for 2012 cars for teams not purchasing 2013 chassis, while the number of engines and tyres they can utilize over the course of the season have been restricted. Diesel engines were allowed in the LMP2 category for the first time. Limits on tyres were also set in the LMGTE Am category.\nEntries.\nThe World Endurance Championship received entries in four classes, including Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1), Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2), Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance — Professional (LMGTE Pro) and Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance — Amateur (LMGTE Am). The entry list for the 2013 season was released by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest on 1 February, and included six LMP1 and twelve LMP2 cars, six LMGTE Pro entries, and eight LMGTE Am cars, bringing the full grid up to thirty-two entrants. Two LMP2 teams, Starworks Motorsport and HVM Status GP later withdrew their full-season entries citing a lack of funding.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below. Invitational entries may have finished ahead of WEC competitors in individual races.\nEntries are required to complete the timed race as well as to complete 70% of the overall winning car's race distance in order to earn championship points. A single bonus point is awarded to the team and all drivers of the pole position car for each category in qualifying. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the race result points allocation was doubled. Due to the 6 Hours of Fuji not completing 75% of the race time, half points were awarded in all championships.\nDrivers Championships.\nFour titles are awarded to drivers in the 2013 season. A World Championship is reserved for LMP1 and LMP2 drivers. A World Cup is available for drivers in the LMGTE categories. Further, two FIA Endurance Trophies are also awarded to drivers in the LMP2 and LMGTE Am categories.\nFIA World Endurance Championship — Drivers.\nAllan McNish, Tom Kristensen and Loïc Duval won the Championship at the 6 Hours of Shanghai.\nFIA World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers.\nGianmaria Bruni won the FIA World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers at the 6 Hours of Bahrain.\nFIA Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Drivers.\nBertrand Baguette, Martin Plowman and Ricardo González earned the Trophy for LMP2 Drivers at the 6 Hours of Bahrain.\nFIA Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Am Drivers.\nJamie Campbell-Walter and Stuart Hall secured the Trophy for LMGTE Am Drivers at the 6 Hours of Bahrain.\nManufacturers' Championships.\nTwo manufacturers' championships are held in the FIA WEC, one for sports prototypes and one for grand tourers. The World Manufacturers' Championship is only open to manufacturer entries in the LMP1 category, and points are only awarded to the highest scoring entry from each manufacturer for each event. The World Cup for GT Manufacturers allows entries from both LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am to participate, and allows the top two finishing cars from each manufacturer to earn points toward their total. Audi secured their second consecutive World Manufacturers' Championship at the 6 Hours of Fuji. Ferrari won their second consecutive World Cup at the 6 Hours of Bahrain.\nTeams Championships.\nTeams in each of the four FIA WEC categories are eligible for their own FIA Endurance Trophies. Each car is scored separately, unlike 2012 in which team results were combined.\nFIA Endurance Trophy for Private LMP1 Teams.\nThe FIA Endurance Trophy for Private LMP1 Teams was open only to private teams competing in LMP1 without manufacturer support. Following Strakka Racing's withdrawal mid-season, Rebellion Racing were the only team to complete the championship.\nFIA Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Teams.\nThe Trophy for LMP2 Teams was won by the No. 35 car of OAK Racing at the 6 Hours of Bahrain.\nFIA Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Pro Teams.\nThe Trophy for LMGTE Pro Teams was won by the No. 51 car of AF Corse at the 6 Hours of Bahrain.\nFIA Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Am Teams.\nThe No. 81 car of 8 Star Motorsports won the Trophy for LMGTE Am Teams at the 6 Hours of Bahrain."

        "text": "The Chattanooga Mocs women's basketball team, formerly known as the Lady Mocs, represents the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in NCAA women's basketball competition. The team is coached by Deandra Schirmer, and play their home games at McKenzie Arena.\nThe team has won 20 SoCon Tournament championships, five consecutively from 2013 through 2017, and have made 17 NCAA tournament appearances, most recently in 2024. The 2015–16 team began the season ranked 25th in the AP poll.\nHead Coaches.\nThe Chattanooga women's team has had only eight coaches in their 50-season history: Grace Keith, Sharon Fanning-Otto, Craig Parrott, Wes Moore, Jim Foster, Katie Burrows, Shane Poppies, and Deandra Schirmer.\nGrace Keith.\nKeith had settled into teaching for two years at Chattanooga's Hixson Elementary School, following her 12 years of coaching the girls' basketball team at Hixson High School. Title IX became law in 1972 and began affecting the mostly male-dominated college athletics across the US, allowing women to participate. Harold Wilkes, then athletic director for UTC and friend to Keith's superiors, offered her a job as head coach for the UTC Mocettes. After a few chaotic months of building a program, the former intramural Chattanooga team began its varsity era in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, eight years before the NCAA allowed women's basketball as a sport. In 1976, Keith retired from basketball to return to teaching.\nSharon Fanning-Otto.\nOne of the players Keith recruited was Chattanooga High School standout Sharon Fanning, who also played and later coached both UTC's volleyball (until 1978) and women's basketball teams. Fanning also renamed the Mocettes as the Lady Mocs. In 1982, the NCAA began hosting women's championships. The Lady Mocs joined the Southern Conference, which only included East Tennessee State, Marshall and Appalachian State University. UTC claimed the first regular season title that year and went on to win five straight titles under Fanning's leadership. She went on to become an eight-year head coach for the Kentucky Wildcats in 1987 and retired in 2012, following a 17-year coaching career with the Mississippi State Lady Bulldogs.\nCraig Parrott.\nCraig Parrott had spent several years coaching high school basketball teams before Fanning offered him an assistant coaching job at UTC in 1986. The following year, Fanning departed for Kentucky and Parrott was asked to fill the position. He became the first coach to take the program to the NCAA Tournament, after winning the SoCon Tournament in 1989. In the 1991–92 season, he again led the team to the NCAA, after sharing the regular season conference title and winning the SoCon. In 1998, he returned to coaching high school teams in Walker County, Georgia, and retired in 2014.\nWes Moore.\nWes Moore became the fourth Chattanooga women's basketball coach in 1998. In 15 seasons, he led the Lady Mocs to 12 SoCon regular season titles, nine SoCon tournament championships, and nine NCAA Tournament berths, becoming the winningest coach in UTC and SoCon history. The six-time SoCon Coach of the Year had an overall record of 358–113, 222–42 (SoCon). In 2013, he went on to coach the NC State Wolfpack.\nJim Foster.\nOn May 9, 2013, Chattanooga announced the hiring of Jim Foster to become the new head women's basketball coach. Foster has 37 years of coaching experience at St. Joseph's, Vanderbilt, Ohio State University and Chattanooga, along with four Big Ten Conference coach of the year awards. Soon after taking the job at Chattanooga, Foster was voted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. Foster retired from coaching at the end of the 2018 season.\nKatie Burrows.\nIn May 2018, Katie Burrows was named as the new head women's basketball coach. An alumna of Chattanooga, Burrows served as an assistant coach under Moore and Foster, respectively.\nShawn Poppie.\nIn 30 March 2022, Shawn Poppie was named as the new head women's basketball coach. Previously he was assistant coach under Kenny Brooks at the Virginia Tech since 2016.\nDeandra Schirmer.\nIn 4 April 2024, Deandra Schirmer was named as the 8th head women's basketball coach. Previously she was the women's basketball head coach at Valdosta State from 2019 to 2024.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Mocs have appeared in seventeen NCAA Tournaments, with a combined record of 1–17."

        "text": "The Dyckman Basketball Tournament is one of the premier summer streetball tournaments in New York City. It is located in Monsignor Kett Playground a.k.a. Dyckman Park in the Washington Heights/Inwood section of Manhattan. What was a one division, six-team tournament in its first season in 1990 is currently a tournament with six age divisions, containing a total of 77 teams. Its college/pro division is the most notable of them all, on any given night you are liable to see NBA, NCAA, and overseas professionals on the court.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was formed by Kenneth Stevens, Omar Booth, and Michael Jenkins in an effort to provide a positive outlet for the community. Inwood, like many other neighborhoods in inner cities during the late 1980s was plagued by the crack epidemic. The community was infested with drugs, crime and interracial turf wars between the emerging Dominican population and the existing black population in the area. During this time Monsignor Kett Playground was in horrible conditions and free of basketball and any related activities. The park that was once known for being a Holcombe Rucker site during the 1970s was now an eyesore for the community and area residents. Stevens, Booth, and Jenkins painted the court and restored the park to conditions apt to host a tournament. The three believed creating a basketball tournament would spark positive relations through sport, community and goodwill, thus changing the culture in the community and furthering the effort to better the community. In its first season the tournament hosted a six-team, twelve-man roster playing in a five-game regular season leading to the playoffs. The tournament continued to progress every year with help from local businesses who sponsored the tournament. On its tenth anniversary it landed its first corporate sponsor in Converse (shoe company). From there on they have received sponsorships from numerous corporate companies in addition to their local supporters. Their biggest sponsors have been Nike, Inc., who has been affiliated since 2004. In 2011 Nike formed a team in the tournament with the top street ballers in NYC and named them “Team Nike.” Coached by the legendary Maxwell \"Bingo\" Cole, they won the championship.\nReferences.\nThe Dyckman Basketball Tournament is also featured in the 2003 Billboard Magazine Sports &amp; Recreation TOP 10 DVD-\"STREETBALL CLASSICS. VOL. 1"

The school's team currently competes in the Coastal Athletic Association.\nHistory.\nMonmouth began play in 1982. They played in the Cosmopolitan Conference from 1982 to 1986. In 1983, the Hawks went 14–14 while winning the Cosmopolitan Conference and getting the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. That year, they won the Opening round game versus Dartmouth 77–58 to advance to the First Round. They lost 107–35 to Cheyney. This remains their only NCAA Tournament appearance. They joined the ECAC Metro in 1986, which rebranded as the Northeast Conference in 1988. The Hawks won the NEC tournament in 1987 going 16–0 in conference play while beating Fairleigh Dickinson 92–65 for their first (and so far only) conference tournament title. However, they did not go to the NCAA Tournament due to the conference not having an automatic bid to the tournament until 1994. In 1988, they won the regular season title again with a 16–0 record, but they lost to Robert Morris 63–60 in the final. The Hawks left the conference for the MAAC after the 2012–13 season. As of the end of the 2015–16 season, the Hawks have an all-time record of 520–473.\nIn the 2020–21 season, they went 2–16 and lost in the first round of the MAAC tournament.

Since its opening, the stadium has hosted a number of provincial, national, and international tournaments, including two World Under-18 Championships, two Canadian Senior Championships, and the 1997 Canada Summer Games baseball tournament. During the 1997 Summer Games, a TSN broadcaster commented that Westbran Stadium was \"as good as many Triple-A fields\".\nIn 2007, the stadium was renamed Andrews Field in recognition of the late Neil Andrews, a long time volunteer and local baseball executive. The ballpark was renovated and refurbished in 2019 in preparation for the Wheat City Whiskey Jacks, who began play in the Expedition League for the 2019 season.\nAndrews Field was among the top eight chosen for Canada's Favourite Ballpark, a contest held in 2011 by Baseball Canada."

The team was assembled occasionally from 1907, the year rugby league football was first played in Australia, until 1988, the year the Brisbane Broncos began competing in Sydney's Winfield Cup premiership.\nHistory.\nIn 1907 a team made up of Brisbane rugby players was formed to play a game for the 1907–1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain, which the visiting 'All Blacks' won 43-10. The Bulimba Cup was a competition contested by the Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba representative rugby league sides which started in 1925.\nDuring the 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand, a Brisbane side was again formed to play against France, losing to the visitors in the last two minutes by a single point.\nDuring the 1958 Great Britain Lions tour the Brisbane rugby league team hosted the touring British at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground and were defeated 29–34.\nThe Bulimba Cup competition last took place in 1972. Brisbane had won it more than any other team.\nA Combined Brisbane side reached the final of the 1979 AMCO Cup but lost 22-5 to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Brisbane's side for the 1984 National Panasonic Cup, captained by Wally Lewis, defeated the Eastern Suburbs Roosters 12-11 in the final at the Leichhardt Oval in Sydney.\nWhen the Brisbane Broncos assembled the team to play their first ever game in 1988, most of the inaugural 17 players (including Lewis, Scott, Miles, Kilroy, and Dowling) that defeated the defending 1987 Sydney Rugby League premiers Manly-Warringah Sea-Eagles 44-10 at Lang Park, had previously played in the Brisbane Rugby League's team. Later that year a combined Brisbane team played against the touring Great Britain Lions. Since 1988 a Queensland Residents side has occasionally been selected and drew heavily on the Brisbane Rugby League premiership until that competition ended in 1997."

        "text": "The 1984 United States men's Olympic basketball team competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, representing the United States. The USA's senior men's team, was led by coach Bob Knight, who was also the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers at the time. The team won the tournament's gold medal. It was the last amateur-level U.S. team to win an Olympic gold medal in men's basketball. The team was considered to be one of the strongest in U.S.A.'s history at that time, as it featured four of the five 1984 consensus first team All-Americans, in Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Wayman Tisdale, and Sam Perkins.\nDue to the 1984 Summer Olympic Games boycott, which was led by the Soviet Union and involved 14 Eastern Bloc countries and allies, the Soviet Union national team and the Hungarian national team withdrew from the tournament. However, the 1980 Summer Olympic Games gold medalists, Yugoslavia, defied the boycott to play at the tournament, and ultimately won the bronze medal.\nOlympic trials.\nTrials for the team were held in April 1984 at Knight's regular base of operations at Indiana's campus in Bloomington. Seventy players attended the trials. Kentucky post players Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin chose to skip the trials, in order to concentrate on the upcoming 1984 NBA draft, and Keith Lee of Memphis State, Len Bias of Maryland and Kenny Smith of North Carolina, ultimately pulled out as well. Knight led the trials with assistant coaches George Raveling, Don Donoher and C. M. Newton, whittling the prospects down to twenty, by the end of the first week of the trials.\nDuring the trials, Auburn junior Charles Barkley impressed with his performance - most observers felt he and North Carolina shooting guard Michael Jordan were the two top performers. However, Barkley's and Knight's strong personalities did not mesh, and Barkley was one of the last cuts from the roster. Released along with Barkley, in the penultimate cut from 20 to 16 players in May, were John Stockton of Gonzaga, Terry Porter of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and Maurice Martin of Saint Joseph's.\nKnight's final cut to twelve players came in June, and the final four let go were Tim McCormick of Michigan, Lancaster Gordon of Louisville, Johnny Dawkins of Duke and Barkley's Auburn teammate Chuck Person (Dawkins and Person served as alternates for the team). The most controversial selection was Knight's own Indiana player, Steve Alford, who was the team's youngest member at 19 and not expected by most to make the team.\nPrior to the Olympics, the team played eight games against NBA All-Star teams including Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre and won all eight.\nOlympic tournament.\nThe team went 8–0 in the Olympic tournament, averaging 95.4 points per game, and holding their opponents to 63.3. Four players averaged double-figures in scoring: Michael Jordan (17.1), Chris Mullin (11.6), Patrick Ewing (11.0) and Steve Alford (10.3). Wayman Tisdale led the team in rebounding (5.9 per game), while Leon Wood led the team in assists (7.9 per game).\nLegacy.\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics was a coming-out party for Michael Jordan, who led Team USA in scoring and dazzled the worldwide viewing audience with his athleticism and speed, including during the sweep of the NBA All-Stars before the Olympics. In addition to Jordan, the team featured two other future Hall of Fame members in Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin (both of whom would later reunite with Jordan, as a part of the 1992 Dream Team). Jordan recalled that while this Olympic experience was exciting, it had also been trying because of Knight: \"I don't know if I would have done it if I knew what Knight was going to be like.\"\nThe Olympics and trials helped the draft stock of several players. Vern Fleming and Jeff Turner parlayed their Olympic exposure into first-round spots in the 1984 NBA draft, while several players that were cut from the team, either received strong recommendations from Knight (future Hall of Fame member John Stockton and Tim McCormick), or benefited from exposure from the trials (Charles Barkley and Lancaster Gordon)."

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "There were many controversies and concerns affecting the 2014 Winter Olympics. There were disputes with Circassians, who demanded the events be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for the 19th century Circassian genocide, environmental and economic issues, lack of political stability and governance, and the safety and human rights of LGBT athletes and journalists, in light of Russia's \"gay propaganda\" laws, which sparked Olympic-focused protests. However, all of these events were overshadowed by the massive Russian state-sponsored doping program uncovered in the aftermath of the Games.\nCircassian genocide.\nCircassian organisations have spoken out against the Olympics, arguing that the Games will take place on land that had been inhabited by them since the beginning of recorded history by their ancestors until 1864, when the resolution of the Russian–Circassian War was stated to have caused the disappearance (variously by death or deportation) of around 800,000–1,500,000 Circassians. They demanded the Sochi 2014 Olympics be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologises for the Circassian genocide. Some Circassian groups have not expressed outright opposition to the Olympics but argue that symbols of Circassian history and culture should be included in the format, as Australia, the United States, and Canada did for their indigenous populations in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.\nThe games are viewed to be particularly offensive because they include the date of the 150th anniversary of the Circassian genocide. It has thus been a rallying cry for Circassian nationalists.\nIn particular, there is much ire over the use of a hill called \"Red Hill\". In 1864, a group of Circassians tried to return home but were attacked and a battle ensued, ending in their massacre, and attaining the name \"Red Hill\" (for the blood spilled). There were skiing and snowboarding events planned to be held on this hill.\nHuman rights.\nOn 30 January 2014, nine Amnesty International European directors delivered a petition in Moscow to the offices of Russian President Vladimir Putin calling on him to repeal a series of laws restricting the right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of association in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics. The organization felt that the laws were no substitute for an effective justice system, and demanded the Russian authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all prisoners of conscience (POCs). The Russian parliament passed an amnesty bill that freed the imprisoned Pussy Riot singers, the foreign activists amongst Greenpeace's \"Arctic 30\" and the 2012 Bolotnaya Square protest.\nHuman Rights Watch has repeatedly presented the IOC detailed evidence of documented human rights abuses linked to Russia's preparations for the 2014 Winter Games since 2009. Human Rights Watch have documented exploitation of migrant workers in violation of Russian law; evictions of residents without fair compensation and in some cases, with no compensation at all. Many resettled residents lost a portion of their livelihoods; Threats, harassment, and lawsuits of activists and journalists critical of the Games, as well as Russia's discriminatory anti-LGBT propaganda law. Not before late 2013 the Russian government and IOC covered $8.34 million in wage arrears.\nBoth German president Joachim Gauck and European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Viviane Reding publicly boycotted the Games over human rights abuses, with Reding specifically citing Russia's treatment of minorities.\nOn 21 January 2014 Russian authorities sentenced left activist Vladislav Ryazantsev to 15 days. Ryazantsev is one of the leaders of the Left Front movement. He has been arrested allegedly for swearing at a bus stop late one evening.\nVladislav Ryazantsev and his fellow activists had planned to hold an action under the slogan of boycott of Sochi Olympics.\nOn 5 February 2014 Russian authorities sentenced environmental activist Igor Kharchenko to five days. Kharchenko is member of the Russian NGO Environmental Watch for North Caucasus (Ecologicheskaya Vakhta po Severnomu Kavkazu). He has been arrested and his car was vandalized. Sergei Nikitin, Amnesty International's Moscow Office Director said: \"The Russian authorities must halt their harassment of civil society activists, protect the right to peaceful freedom of expression, and release the Sochi prisoners of conscience: Igor Kharchenko and his fellow environmentalist Yevgeny Vitishko, who is currently serving 15 days in administrative detention on trumped-up charges.\"\nEvgeny Vitishko was arrested for 15 days in the Sochi area reportedly charged allegedly for swearing at a bus stop. Yevgeniy Vitishko and his fellow activists have been actively involved in protests regarding the deforestation and illegal construction and fencing in areas of protected forest around Sochi. AI is concerned about his unfair trial resulted in a court decision to send him to prison colony for three years.\nPolice arrests.\nTwo members of the punk group Pussy riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, and a group of activists and journalists were arrested by Russian police in Sochi when simply walking down the street. Pussy Riot members have urged politicians attending the Winter Olympics to criticise human rights abuses in Russia. According to Amnesty International people are being targeted for peacefully speaking their minds. Almost daily there are reports of arrests of activists in Sochi and the Olympic Games area including Semyon Simonov Memorial, David Hakim and journalists from Radio Free Europe and Novaya Gazeta. Amnesty demanded the International Olympic Committee to condemn the arrests.\nLGBT rights.\nThe rights of LGBT people in Russia were a concern leading up to the Games (where seven openly lesbian and bisexual athletes, all female, were scheduled to participate). Russia became the subject of international criticism following the signing of a federal law by Vladimir Putin in June 2013, which banned the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors. Mass media classified the legislation as being \"anti-gay\", while LGBT rights activists considered the law to be too broad and vague, characterizing it as an effective ban on promoting LGBT rights and culture. Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin argued that even kissing a same-sex partner or displaying LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag could be illegal under the law. The legislation was also attributed to an increase in homophobic violence in Russia by anti-gay and Neo-Nazi groups. Critics also considered the law to be inconsistent with principle six of the Olympic Charter, which states that \"any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.\" \"\nAssurances.\nIn August 2013, the IOC stated that it had \"received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games\"; this was contradicted in a statement three days later made by Russia's Ministry of the Interior, which stated that the anti-propaganda laws would still be enforced in Sochi. The IOC also confirmed that it would enforce Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which forbids political protest, against athletes who make displays of support for the LGBT community. The IOC received written assurance from the Russian government in August 2013 stating that it was committed to abiding by the Olympic Charter during the Olympic Games. Vladimir Putin also made similar assurances prior to the Games, but warned LGBT attendees to abide by the law. Anatoly Pakhomov, mayor of Sochi, explained to reporters prior to the Games that homosexuality \"was not the custom in the Caucasus\", and claimed that no gays lived in Sochi at all (despite the presence of two gay clubs and evidence of an LGBT community in Sochi on a Russian social network). He went on to say that everyone, including gays, were welcome in Sochi, \"as long as they do not impose their habits on others.\"\nProtests and campaigns.\nDespite these assurances, Olympic-focused protests and campaigns, such as the Principle 6 campaign (a collaboration between a group of Olympic athletes, the organizations All Out, Athlete Ally, and clothing maker American Apparel), have been held in protest of Russia's anti-gay policies. There were also calls to boycott the Games, drawing comparisons to the Summer Olympics of 1980 in Moscow. However, a writer for the \"Financial Times\" felt that such a boycott would be counter-productive, given that there was no boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing despite China's poor human rights record, but suggested that action by Olympic sponsors would be more effective.\nAt January 2014 Russian leader of the Left Front movement Vladislav Ryazantsev together with like-minded persons opened out an informative campaign against Olympic Games in Sochi. In the social network of VK.com appeared the group «Boycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi» in which Ryazantsev united with left activist Anton Morvan publishes devastating information about the cost of Olympic Games and scales saw cut at its preparation. In addition, the group collects information about the game shooting of animals in the city-resort. — The Group «Boycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi» is one of many private initiatives of left activists. Its purpose is collection and publication of true information about violations, crimes and peculations during the preparation of the Olympic Games, helping to open eyes people», — Vladislav Ryazantsev reported to the journalist of Donnews.ru. — «In addition, we call to declare boycott, avoid watching the games and buying commodities with symbolism of Olympic Games».\nA number of world leaders, including United States president Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and French President François Hollande, declined to attend the Games' Opening Ceremony as delegates for various reasons. Although attending the Winter Olympics has not historically been a priority for world leaders, there was still speculation that their non-attendance was a symbolic boycott of Russian policies. The U.S. appointed tennis player Billie Jean King and women's hockey player Caitlin Cahow, who are both openly gay, as its delegation instead. Although Obama stressed diversity and made no reference to the controversy when announcing the delegation, on 6 February 2014, he confirmed the intent of the choices during an interview with Bob Costas aired by NBC the next day, stating that \"there is no doubt we wanted to make it very clear that we do not abide by discrimination in anything, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\" Cahow stated that the decision was meant to \"[highlight] Americans who know what it means to have freedoms and liberties under the Constitution. That's really what we're representing in Sochi and it's not at all different from what's espoused in the spirit of Olympism.\"\nIn February 2014, prior to the games, a group of 40 human rights organizations (including Athlete Ally, Freedom House, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch and Russian LGBT network among others) sent a joint letter to the ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies, urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter, and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the human rights abuses of future host countries. On 3 February 2014, USOC sponsor AT&amp;T issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games, becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws. Several major non-sponsors also made pro-LGBT statements to coincide with the opening of the Games; Google placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic-themed logo in the colors of the rainbow flag on its home page worldwide, while Channel 4 (who serves as the official British broadcaster of the Paralympics) adopted a rainbow-colored logo and broadcast a \"celebratory\", pro-LGBT advert entitled \"Gay Mountain\" on 7 February 2014, alongside an interview with former rugby union player and anti-homophobia activist Ben Cohen.\nThe \"Huffington Post\" noted that the opening ceremony, ironically, featured tributes to \"some of history's most widely acclaimed and definitely gay Russians\", including composer Peter Tchaikovsky (1840–1893), ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky (1889–1950), and patron of arts, and founder of Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev. Russian organizers denied any connection, stating that these figures were selected because of their cultural significance. On the same topic, critics also noted the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u were invited to perform during the opening ceremony; although they are not actually lesbian, the all-female duo were well known for incorporating themes of lesbianism in their music and on-stage personas (live appearances often featured the singers kissing each other), its name is a corruption of a shortened Russian phrase meaning \"this girl loves that girl\", and the duo made a statement in support of LGBT rights in the wake of Yuri Luzhkov's objection to the 2007 Moscow Pride parade. Organizers noted that t.A.T.u were chosen because they were well known to an international audience, denying any relation to LGBT rights.\nDoping scandal.\nIn December 2014, German public broadcaster ARD aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In November 2015, Russia's track and field team was provisionally suspended by the IAAF.\nIn May 2016, \"The New York Times\" published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.\nIn December 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation.\nThree ladies artistic skaters were named as being under investigation. They are Adelina Sotnikova, the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Ksenia Stolbova. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds.\nSix skiers were provisionally suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren report: Evgeniy Belov, Alexander Legkov, Alexey Petukhov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yuliya Ivanova and Yevgeniya Shapovalova. Legkov won a gold medal, and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals.\nThe International Biathlon Union provisionally suspended two biathletes who were in the Sochi games: Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova, according to \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal. They both retired after the 2014/2015 season.\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation provisionally suspended four skeleton sliders. They are among the six athletes on the skeleton team: Nikita Tregubov, Alexander Tretyakov, Sergey Chudinov, Elena Nikitina, Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a silver.\nIt has been speculated that some Russian Winter Olympians used xenon gas in preparation for the Sochi Games. Using xenon gas is not specifically banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA); however, it could be used for performance enhancement and raises questions about what constitutes doping and practices that should and should not be allowed.\nEvent judging.\nAllegations of vote swapping.\nFrench sports newspaper \"L'Équipe\", quoting an anonymous Russian coach, alleged that Russia and the United States would swap votes, with the United States voting for Russian athletes in pairs figure skating and team events and Russia voting for the Americans in ice dancing. The allegations were categorically denied by U.S. Figure Skating.\nMen's ice hockey tournament.\nDuring a men's ice hockey tournament round-robin game between the U.S. and Russia, a Russian goal scored late in the third period, which would have given the team a 3–2 lead, was disallowed after referees ruled that the net was moved when the goal was scored. The decision resulted in the score remaining 2–2. The U.S. went on to win the game in a shootout, which resulted in Russia playing a playoff qualification game while the U.S. received a bye to the quarterfinals. The decision was criticized by many Russian politicians, TV hosts and commentators. Following the game, protesters led by the Kremlin party's youth group held a demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy in Moscow to protest the decision. In response to the controversy, Konstantin Komissarov, the referee supervisor of International Ice Hockey Federation, officially confirmed that the decision by the referee was correct, citing the appropriate use of video review in assessing the play.\nLadies' singles figure skating.\nImmediately after the final scores were announced, confirming Russia's victory, journalistic questions arose regarding whether Russian 17-year-old Adelina Sotnikova's performances deserved higher scores than the performances of 23-year-old Yuna Kim from South Korea. Questions over the judges, the judging system, and the anonymity of scores were also raised in the press.\nAthlete selection controversies.\nSeveral controversial choices of the athletes going to the Olympics to represent countries have occurred.\nThe participation of Lebanese alpine skier Jackie Chamoun became controversial in Lebanon after it was revealed at home in 2014 that she had posed in sexy photos for an Austrian calendar in 2011. A ministerial investigation has been mooted, while an online support protest \"Strip for Jackie\" has been organized. Chamoun has denied that she posed nude publicly on her Facebook page, saying that the behind the scenes images were not for publication.\nIn South Korea, a furore has erupted over the loss of Viktor Ahn (Ahn Hyun-Soo) to Team Russia. Several newspapers reported the scorn of the Korean public and newspaper editors on the actions of the Korea Skating Union. The minister of sport and president of South Korea have both promised action in rooting out corruption and feuding at the organization that may have led to his \"defection\", in a bid to clean it up in preparation for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. The Korean public had generally been supportive of Ahn, but he later received online bashing after the Yuna Kim controversy.\nThe United States' selection of Ashley Wagner over Mirai Nagasu for the Olympic team caused some controversy as Nagasu finished ahead of Wagner at the 2014 U.S. Championships. The results at the pre-Olympic nationals often play a major role in the decision process but U.S. Figure Skating never stated that they would be the only results considered. Wagner was selected on the body of her work, instead of her performance at that event.\nThis was the first time that U.S. Figure Skating selected a skater who had competed in the pre-Olympic nationals and lost over another on who had also competed. On previous occasions, this was done for skaters who had been injured and unable to compete at nationals.\nThe selection of Evgeni Plushenko by the Russia Olympic Team for figure skating caused some controversy, as he had been beaten by Maxim Kovtun at the 2014 Russian Figure Skating Championships. Plushenko said he won't participate in European Championships and will give spot at men's singles for Kovtun and he will participate in the team event only. ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta cautioned the Figure Skating Federation of Russia, \"If one of your skaters has sustained the same injury for years. You should not enter him or her.\" Plushenko skated strongly in the Short and Free Programs for the Team Event, however in the Men's individuals he withdrew right before the start of the Short Program which left host Russia without an entry since it was too late have Kovtun as a replacement. Russian figure skating officials defended the initial selection of Plushenko by noting that Kovtun had done poorly at international events.\nFollowing the games in July, four Slovenian officials were suspended for four years from FIS after they helped to falsify times and rankings to allow alpine skier Vanessa Vanakorn (best known as the British violinist Vanessa-Mae and represented for Thailand as her father is a Thai) to achieve an average of 140 points of fewer at an FIS event to enable her to qualify for Olympics. At an FIS event in Krvavec, where she achieved her required score, she finished 6th (and last) in the national junior championships, despite being over 14 years older to the next eldest contestant. She also finished 7th (but last), 9th (of 13th) and 10th (of 13th). She finished with a total time of 3:26.97, 50.10 seconds behind the winner, Tina Maze of Slovenia. She was last among the finishers, ranking 67th. During investigations by FIS, it was revealed that the event was fixed to enable her to compete, for example a result including a competitor who was not present in the races, was placed 2nd in one race despite falling and her time was adjusted afterwards by more than 10 seconds, enabling a previously retired competitor who had the best FIS points in the competition to lower the penalty to benefit participants, failing to alter the course between runs and allowing the race to be run despite being suitable under regulations. As a result of taking part in a race rigged to her favor in an event orchestrated by her manager, Vanakorn was banned from skiing for four years.\nPegasus Airlines Flight 751.\nOn 7 February 2014, during the opening ceremony and one day after the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics, a man attempted to hijack Pegasus Airlines Flight 751 that was traveling from Kharkiv, Ukraine, to Istanbul, Turkey. The man claimed he had a bomb on board, and demanded to be flown to Sochi, the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The pilots turned off the inflight monitors and landed at Istanbul's Sabiha Gökçen Airport, fooling the man into thinking he was landing in Sochi. The plane, a Boeing 737-800 reg TC-CCP, was escorted to Istanbul by two Turkish F-16 fighter jets. The man, who appeared to be severely intoxicated, was detained by police and taken to the Istanbul Security Headquarters. In 2018, Russia's President Vladimir Putin admitted that he ordered the shooting down of a passenger plane that was reportedly carrying a bomb and targeting the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nEnvironment.\nDespite several expert statements that the construction of Olympic venues in the buffer area of the UNESCO protected Caucasus Biosphere Reserve and Sochi National Park could be harmful, the IOC approved the plans. Greenpeace of Russia said that the IOC and the Russian Government assumed all responsibility for any damage to the West Caucasus natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to the Sochi bid, a wide array of construction was planned in the Grushevyi Ridge area. They included a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Mzymta River, sewage treatment facilities, a high-speed rail link, a Mountain Olympic Village, a track for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton (which was relocated in May 2009), and a biathlon venue. Alpine skiing venues were being constructed in the Rosa Khutor plateau and the Psekhako Ridge area. Environmentalists proposed building up Krasnaya Polyana instead of destroying nature reserve sites.\nEnvironmentalists also opposed the plan of construction of a cargo terminal for ships in the mouth of the Psou River in the Imereti Lowland, because this could lead to the destruction of the largest areas of sea-flooded shore and marshes.\nOn 3 July 2008, Vladimir Putin directed some of the Olympic venues, such as the luge and bobsleigh track, to be relocated (the Russian National Sliding Centre was relocated in May 2009). He said \"In setting our priorities and choosing between money and the environment, we're choosing the environment.\"\nGeologist Sergei Volkov fled to Ukraine after speaking out about environmental and geological problems. He stated that mercury and uranium deposits, as well as the probability of landslides, made the location of the games hazardous. He also argued that the location of a cargo port was inappropriate. A storm there killed three seamen and destroyed $14 million of infrastructure.\nOn 29 October 2013 it was reported that Russia broke its 'Zero Waste' Olympic Pledge, as it emerged that Russia's state-owned rail monopoly was dumping tons of construction waste into an illegal landfill, raising concerns of possible contamination in the water that directly supplies Sochi.\nAnimal rights.\nThe issue of stray dogs has come up before the Olympics. On 3 February 2014, the city hired a firm to exterminate the stray population – an approach that has brought international condemnation. These plans have been abandoned after complaints by local citizens. The stray dogs will be collected from the streets and put in a shelter.\nRussia originally planned to have two orca whales perform in the opening ceremonies of the Sochi 2014 Olympics. They were two of eight whales captured off the coast of Russia. After backlash by various advocacy groups and petitions signed by the general public, a statement was released that the whales would not be part of the Olympics. The current whereabouts of the whales are unknown.\nIt was rumored that the committee had planned to have a dolphin trained to carry the Olympic torch. Activists spoke up about the issue immediately, causing the President of the Olympics Committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, to issue the statement that, \"I confirm that we do not involve any orcas or dolphins for the Olympics.\" Whether or not there had been any plans for a dolphin torchbearer has never been confirmed.\nEconomy.\nAccording to \"The New York Times\" the $50 billion or so lavished on Sochi is becoming a political liability. The stalling of the economy, despite the stimulus of Olympic spending, has raised worries about popular unrest directed at the Kremlin and a tightening of political freedoms in response once the Games are over. \"It is about what Russia could have done with this money.\" said Aleksei A. Navalny, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption.\nAccording to IRN.Ru analytical agency, prices for land, located next to the shoreline, reach $150,000 per 100 m2, while price per square metre in average panel apartment building on the outskirts of the city already reaches $2000. \"As a result of 2014 Olympics euphoria prices will rise annually by 15–20%,\" speculates Irina Tyurina, press secretary of Russian Tourist Industry Union. This could lead to decrease in tourist interest to Sochi, which already has fallen below Anapa, Gelendzhik, and Adler.\nAfter the IOC Evaluation Commission visited Sochi in February 2007, local authorities promised to buy the lands from Lower Imereti Bay long-time residents for a fair market price. But during the following half a year, no local resident could get their land approved as private property.\nWhile most Olympic Games have high cost overruns, for these Games they are much higher than usual. Much of the cost overruns have been blamed on corruption, with Boris Nemtsov claiming: \"The Sochi Olympics are an unprecedented thieves' caper in which representatives of Putin's government are mixed up along with the oligarchs close to the government.\" According to research by Transparency International, a global anti-corruption watchdog, approximately 50 percent or more of the building costs went to corruption.\nPoor workers conditions and rights have also been raised as an issue of concern, with at least 25 people dying and many more injured in accidents on sites in 2012 and with workers not getting paid at all.\nPolitical stability and governance.\nThe 2008 Russia–Georgia war, which broke out at the start of the 2008 Summer Olympics, surprised the Olympic community. \"It is not what the world wants to see. It is contrary to what the Olympic ideal stands for\", said an IOC spokesperson. However, in November 2008, the IOC turned down a request by the Georgian National Olympic Committee to reconsider its decision to hold the Olympics on the territory \"adjacent both to the [Russian-]occupied Abkhaz conflict zone, and to the extremely unstable and volatile North Caucasus\".\nRelated concerns persist, regarding the region's safety and the desirability of hosting an Olympics in a conflict-ridden zone. \"The region is such a muddied and bloodied aquarium of conflict that to pick out any one fish is impossible,\" says Oleg Nechiporenko, chief analyst for Russia's National Anti-Terrorist and Anti-Criminal Fund, in response to a 26 May 2010, car bombing, whose suspects include Russian nationalists, local Russian mafia groups, separatists and Islamists in the North Caucasus, or a remnant of the war in Abkhazia.\nSochi borders Russia's six autonomous North Caucasus republics, home of the Second Chechen War which allegedly face social problems. According to an article in Daily Telegraph, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, head of Saudi intelligence, allegedly confronted the Kremlin with a mix of inducements and threats in a bid to break the deadlock over Syria. This included security of winter olympics in Sochi if there is no accord. \"I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,\" he allegedly said.\nRussian Envoy to the North Caucasus Alexander Khloponin told local law enforcement that \"the violent scramble for assets\" is likely to get worse as Russia invests heavily in tourist infrastructure and Olympic-caliber ski resorts.\nSafety.\nThree suicide bombings in Volgograd, one in October 2013 and the others in December 2013, have raised additional international concerns about security during the Olympics. The IOC expressed sympathy for the victims and underlined that they trusted that Russia's security arrangements for the Olympics would be adequate.\nThe British, German, Italian, Hungarian, Austrian, Slovenian and Slovakian Olympic associations received threats that athletes would be \"blown up\" or kidnapped by terrorists at the Winter Games. According to the IOC, the letters did not represent any real threat.\nMedia coverage.\nIOC President Thomas Bach criticized attempts to politicize the Games, saying that governments should not send political messages \"on the backs of their athletes.\" Benjamin Bidder of \"Spiegel Online\" and Julia Ioffe of \"The New Republic\" compared the negative pre-Sochi coverage to schadenfreude and Russophobia, while Anton Fedyashin of \"The Guardian\" blamed lingering Cold War mentalities for \"dishing up a feast of negativity.\" In an editorial published by \"The Nation\", scholar of Russian studies Stephen F. Cohen criticized the \"toxic coverage\" for \"exploiting the threat of terrorism so licentiously it seemed pornographic.\" He further wrote that \"American media on Russia today are less objective, less balanced, more conformist and scarcely less ideological than when they covered Soviet Russia during the Cold War.\" Cohen's views on US-Russian relations were criticized as being pro-Putin.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\" the games were more politicised than the before, serving as shameless promotion of Putin's Russia. While former world chess champion and Russian opposition figure Garry Kasparov said that game bolstered Putin's cult of personality.\nComedians and satirical newspapers took advantage of the widespread pessimism. On 8 February, \"The Daily Currant\" posted a story alleging that a man responsible for operating the Olympic rings during the opening ceremony, which famously suffered a technical glitch, had been \"found dead...with multiple stab wounds.\" The fictional story went viral on social media. On 20 February, luger Kate Hansen posted a well-publicized video on her Twitter account allegedly showing a wolf roaming the hallways of her Sochi hotel; it was later revealed to be a hoax staged by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and Hansen. USA Luge officials distanced themselves from the incident, with spokesman Sandy Caligiore stating, \"I can tell you that our organization is not happy with the incident. That's not USA Luge speaking.\" Throughout the duration of the Olympics the @SochiProblems Twitter account had nearly 100,000 more followers than the official IOC feed @Sochi2014. The blog GossipSochi.com was later set up to debunk @SochiProblems postings, with many revealed to be fakes.\nIn an interview, IOC supervisor Jean-Claude Killy stated that several hotels intended to house the foreign media were unfinished by the opening of the Olympics because officials realized \"too late\" that construction had fallen behind. According to David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, many of the incidents early in the Olympics were \"standard problems\" and were not unique to Sochi. Wallechinsky further noted, \"When you mess up with the media before the Games start, you're going to have a problem.\" In an interview that aired on Russian television on 24 February, Vladimir Putin opined that much of the criticism stemmed from rivalry in international politics, saying \"There is a cohort of critics that are far from sport, they are engaged in a competitive struggle in international politics. They used this Olympic project to achieve their own objectives in the field of anti-Russian propaganda.\"\nThe mood greatly improved as the Games progressed. With a few notable exceptions, NBC largely avoided broadcasting negative material, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some U.S. commentators. Following the closing ceremony, Mark Sappenfield of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" concluded that by many measures the Olympics were \"very successful.\" Sappenfield singled out the organization as particularly good, writing that \"Athletes and Olympic officials were nearly unanimous: This was an extraordinarily well run Olympics.\" Thomas Bach also voiced support, stating \"We saw excellent Games and what counts most is the opinions of the athletes and they were enormously satisfied...You have to ask all those who criticised whether they change their opinions now.\"\n2014 Russian Formula One Grand Prix.\nIn 2014, Sochi hosted the Russian Formula One Grand Prix. The circuit runs in and around the Sochi Olympic Park, which led to the IOC expressing concern that construction of the circuit could disrupt preparations for the Olympic Games. The IOC was granted the power to delay the inaugural race until 2015 to ensure the Olympics were held without disruption, but did not use it as competition was not disrupted.\nCountries choosing not to enter competitors.\nA total of 91 nations qualified to compete at the Games. However, three nations chose not to send their athletes to the Games, even though they had met the international qualification standards.\nPuerto Rico is not sending Kristina Krone for the second consecutive time because the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee (COPUR) withdrew its recognition of the Puerto Rico Winter Sports Federation after the 2002 Winter Olympics due to an eligibility controversy involving a member of their bobsled team. According to COPUR president Sara Rosario, \"Until there is a properly constituted winter sports federation with the requisite seriousness upon which we can consistently rely every four years, we cannot endorse (participation by Puerto Rico athletes in the Olympic Winter Games)\". Krone has represented Puerto Rico since 2008 in more than 100 alpine ski competitions sanctioned by the International Ski Federation including the 2009, 2011 and 2013 World Alpine Ski Championships.\nSouth Africa would not enter skier Sive Speelman, who, although invited to compete by the IOC, did not meet the standards set by the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee.\nAlgeria also chose not to enter its only competitor, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi, because he was the only one that managed to qualify, even though he was their only entry four years prior at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\nIndependent participants.\nThere were three Independent Olympic participants from India who competed under the Olympics flag. In December 2012, the Indian Olympic Association was suspended by the IOC due to government interference in the autonomy and election of leaders, thus not complying with the Olympic charter. Fresh elections were due to take place after the opening ceremony so Indian athletes were scheduled to participate as independents.\nCourse adjustments.\nA crash in practice from Norwegian slopestyle snowboarder Torstein Horgmo, who fractured his collarbone, and complaints from other athletes that some jumps were too steep have prompted organizers to modify the slopestyle course in the week before the Games. A few days later the women's downhill ski training was stopped after the opening three racers were getting too much air on the jump down the home stretch. The International Ski Federation had workers adjusting the course making it smoother.\nInadequate preparation of visitor facilities.\nIn the week prior to the start of the Games, reports began coming out of Sochi that a number of the accommodations for visitors and journalists were still incomplete. Several hotels meant to house visitors to the Games were reported to be still under construction upon arrival, as well as missing basic furniture from some of the rooms that had finished construction. The issues forced a number of visitors to seek alternate accommodations. Other problems reported included \"piles of garbage\" on the streets of the media village, as well as significant construction noise.\nOther notable incidents:\nUse of mourning symbols.\nDuring the women's 15-kilometre skiathlon four Norwegian skiers used black mourning binds in honor of teammate Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen's brother who had died unexpectedly on the opening day of the Olympics. The IOC sent a reminder to the Norwegian Olympic Committee (NOC) that using mourning binds was not allowed during the games. IOC's letter caused protests in Norway and Sweden. NOC general secretary Inge Andersen met with IOC president Thomas Bach to discuss the matter on 10 February 2014. Norway's IOC member Gerhard Heiberg indicated that IOC would reconsider the ban against mourning binds.\nFreestyle skiers were told by IOC not to wear helmet stickers in memory of Sarah Burke, who died in an accident in 2012. However, many still did, and the rule was believed to not have been enforced.\nOn 19 February Ukrainian athletes asked for and were refused permission by the IOC to wear black arm bands to honor those killed in the violent clashes in Kyiv the previous day. According to IOC spokesman Mark Adams \"They weren't forbidden to wear armbands. The Ukrainian NOC met with IOC officials informally yesterday. They discussed what should be done, and they reached the conclusion there were other ways of marking this moment. Some athletes have taken other views and other ways of doing things\". IOC president Bach offered his condolences \"to those who have lost loved ones in these tragic events\".\nAthlete boycott.\nOn 19 February 2014 Ukrainian alpine skier Bohdana Matsotska refused to further participate in the Olympic Games in protest of the violent clashes in Kyiv on the previous day. She and her father posted a message on Facebook stating \"In solidarity with the fighters on the barricades of the Maidan, and as a protest against the criminal actions made towards the protesters, the irresponsibility of the president and his lackey government, we refuse further performance at the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014\".\nOn 20 February 2014 the Ukrainian NOC reported that as many as half of the 45 Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics had left the games to return home. But according to Ukrainian NOC president Sergey Bubka they had returned home in compliance with their original schedule, and their departure was thus not related to the riots in Kyiv.\nDrug tests.\nDuring the 2014 Winter Olympics, six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were sent home from the Games.\nOn 21 February, skier Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle of Germany and Italian bobsleigh brakeman William Frullani were both sent home from Sochi after failing drugs tests. They both tested positive for methylhexanamine. On 22 February, Ukrainian cross-country skier Maryna Lisohor was tested positive for trimetazidine and Latvian ice hockey player Vitalijs Pavlovs tested positive for methylhexaneamine. On 23 February, Austrian skier Johannes Dürr tested positive for EPO and Swedish ice hockey player Nicklas Bäckström tested positive for a substance found in an allergy medication.\nMen's freestyle skiing – ski cross.\nBoth Canada and Slovenia appealed separately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport that the three French athletes in the Big Final of the men's ski cross final had their pants illegally changed by their coach. They argued it gave the three an aerodynamic advantage over the rest of the field. Both countries first appealed to the International Ski Federation, but were rejected since they appealed hours after the end of the competition (when the deadline was 15 minutes after the close of the race). The appeal to the court was ultimately unsuccessful as well, because the court agreed with the ski federation that the appeal was filed past the deadline.\nRussian Mafia used to threaten rival campaign allegations.\nThe Russian mafia helped Russia win the games by threatening the Salzburg campaign leader Fedor Radmann, who later resigned in 2007, according to German security officials. Informants observed a meeting between mafia leaders and Russian government foreign policy advisor Sergei Prikhodko in 2006 in a Munich restaurant to discuss the Olympic selection process. Radmann himself denies he ever met any Russian mobsters but his colleagues state that he feared for his life, and the mayor of Salzburg Heinz Schaden confirms the link."

        "title": "List of Ryder Cup matches",
        "text": "The Ryder Cup is a golf competition contested by teams from Europe and the United States. The competition was originally contested between Great Britain and the United States; players from the Channel Islands also appeared on the British team, Republic of Ireland golfers were added to the British team in 1953 (although the team name was only changed to 'Great Britain and Ireland' for the 1973 Ryder Cup) and this was extended to golfers elsewhere in Europe in 1979. Established in 1927, the competition is jointly administered by the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA of America) and Ryder Cup Europe, a venture in which the PGA European Tour is the primary partner. The competition takes place every two years, with the exception of 2001 when the match was played a year later due to the 11 September attacks and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic ; the venue alternates between courses in Europe and the United States. The winners of the first match were the United States, who defeated Great Britain at Worcester Country Club 9–2. The latest Ryder Cup, at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome, Italy, was won by the Europe 16–11 on 1 October 2023.\nThe Ryder Cup is contested in a match play format, which involves different methods of the format. A foursomes match is contested with two members from each team playing alternate shots. A fourball match consists of two players from either team, who each play their own shot throughout the round. The player that completes the hole in the lowest number of shots wins the hole. Singles matches are also played, with players from each team contesting a one-on-one match. The winner of each match scores a point for their team, if a match is tied after 18 holes then each team is awarded a point. The format of the competition has changed throughout its history. Originally, foursome matches were played one day, with singles matches over 36 holes the next. Since 1979, the format has consisted of 28 matches held over three days, with each match worth a point. The first two days consist of eight matches; four foursomes and four fourball matches. The final day sees all 12 members of each team competing in singles matches.\nThe United States are the most successful team in the history of the competition; they have won 27 of the 43 matches that have been contested, 18 of which were before 1979, when the competition was contested between Great Britain and Ireland and the United States. In the 22 matches since the inclusion of European golfers, Europe has won twelve, the United States nine, with one match tied.\nHistory.\nThe first Ryder Cup match was contested in June 1927. The competition held at Worcester Country Club was won 9–2 by the United States. British captain Ted Ray cited the Americans' \"superior putting\" as the reason for their victory. Great Britain improved for the 1929 competition, winning 7–5 at Moortown Golf Club. However, they were unable to replicate this performance in 1931. In 100-degree heat and missing a number of their best players, they were unable to match the Americans at the Scioto Country Club and lost 9–3. The 1933 contest at the Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club was a closer affair than previous matches. It came down to the final match between Syd Easterbrook and Denny Shute. The American Shute had a putt to win the competition, but missed two in succession leaving Easterbrook with a putt to win the contest, which he made to secure a 6–5 victory for the British team. The United States regained the Cup in 1935, when they beat Great Britain 9–3 at Ridgewood Country Club. They became the first team to win the competition outside of their own country in 1937 when they beat the British team 8–4 at Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club.\nThe advent of the Second World War meant the Ryder Cup was not contested again until 1947 at Portland Golf Club. The United States dominated the match in wet conditions, as Great Britain scored one point in an 11–1 defeat. The 1949 match was closer than the previous contest. Great Britain went into the final day with a 3–1 lead, but they were unable to secure the three and a half points they needed to win and lost 7–5. The 1951 contest at Pinehurst Resort, was again won by the United States. Such was the dominance in their 9–2 victory, that only two of the twelve matches reached the 18th hole. Before the 1953 contest Great Britain were given a boost when American Ben Hogan decided not to participate. He had won three of the four men's major golf championships during the year and his absence gave them optimism. However, they were unable to beat the United States; mistakes at the end of their singles matches by Peter Alliss and Bernard Hunt cost Great Britain as they lost 6–5. Despite recording their best points total in matches held in the United States, Great Britain were again defeated in 1955. The United States won 8–4 to extend their winning streak to 21 years.\nThe 1957 contest saw Great Britain regain the Cup for the first time since 1933. They were 3–1 down after the first round of matches, but victory in five out of the seven singles matches made the difference as they won 7–4. The United States regained the Ryder Cup in 1959 beating Great Britain 8–3. The match was the last to be contested over 36 holes of foursomes and singles matches. The format changed to two 18 hole sets of foursomes and singles in 1961, doubling the number of points available from 12 to 24. The change in format did not affect the trend of American dominance as they won 14–9 at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club. Two sets of four balls were introduced in 1963, increasing the number of points available to 32. Again, the changes made little difference to the outcome as the United States won 23–9 at East Lake Golf Club. British player Henry Cotton summed up the display from the Americans, stating: \"We have been outclassed.\" The 1965 match at Royal Birkdale Golf Club started well for Great Britain, as they were trailing the United States 9–7 going into the singles matches. But the Americans proved too strong, winning the majority of the matches to win the contest 19–12.\nThe 1967 match continued the trend of American victories, as the United States won 23–8 at Champions Golf Club. Unlike in previous years, the 1969 match was much closer. The match came down to the last hole of the final singles match between American Jack Nicklaus and British golfer Tony Jacklin. Nicklaus made his putt, which left Jacklin with a putt to tie the match. Despite this, Nicklaus conceded the putt, picking up Jacklin's ball marker. As a result, their match was tied, as was the contest at 16–16. The United States won again in 1971, beating Great Britain 18–13. The 1973 match was the first held in Scotland at Muirfield. The outcome remained the same as Great Britain lost 19–13. The 1975 match at Laurel Valley Golf Club was similar with the United States winning 21–11. The format changed again in 1977, as matches were reduced by nearly a third leaving 20 points available. The changed requested by Great Britain &amp; Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12–7. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete for the first time in 1979. There was another change to the format, the first two days now consisted of eight foursomes and fourballs, with twelve singles matches on the final day. Again, the changes had little effect on the outcome as the United States won 17–11.\nThe 1981 match was originally scheduled to take place at The Belfry, but construction of the course was not completed on time and Walton Heath Golf Club was used instead. The United States, containing a team that had won 36 major championships between them, dominated the match winning 18–9. The 1983 match at PGA National Golf Club was the closest in recent years. After the first two days the match was tied at 8–8. Europe fell short in the singles match, winning four out of the twelve matches and lost the contest 14–13. The 1985 match held at the now completed Belfry, saw Europe win the trophy for the first time in 28 years. Leading 9–7 going into the final day, they won six singles matches to secure a 16–11 victory. Europe retained the Ryder Cup in 1987, beating the United States 15–13 at Muirfield Village, to win in the United States for the first time. The 1989 match was only the second time the contest ended in a tie. Europe were in commanding position when José María Cañizares won his singles match, but defeat in the last four matches meant the match finished 14–14. The 1991 match at Kiawah Island Golf Resort, known as the \"War on the Shore\", saw the United States regain the Cup. The scores were tied at 8–8 going into the final day and the match came down to the last singles match between Europe's Bernhard Langer and American golfer Hale Irwin. Langer missed a putt at the last hole, which meant the United States won 14–13. The United States retained the Cup in 1993, winning 15–13 at The Belfry. Europe regained the trophy in 1995, defeating the United States 14–13 at Oak Hill Country Club.\nThe Ryder Cup was played outside of the British Isles for the first time in 1997, as Valderrama Golf Club in Spain hosted the contest. Despite taking a five-point lead into the final day, Europe needed the half point Colin Montgomerie secured in his tied singles match with Scott Hoch to win 14–13. The 1999 match was the third time in succession the contest had been won by a single point, but this time it was the United States who won 14–13. This was not without controversy, as Europe were unhappy with the celebrations by the American team after a putt by Justin Leonard, while European golfer José María Olazábal still had a chance of holing his putt. The Ryder Cup was scheduled to be played in 2001, but two weeks before the competition was scheduled to take place the September 11 attacks occurred. The United States fearing for their safety requested the match be played a year later in 2002. When the match was played, Europe won 15–12 to regain the Cup. They retained the Cup in 2004 when they won 18–9 at Oakland Hills Country Club, in what was the United States' heaviest defeat in the competition. The result was repeated in 2006 at the K Club. Europe's 18–9 victory marked the first time they had won three matches in succession. The United States regained the Ryder Cup in 2008, winning for the first time since 1999. They won the match when Jim Furyk beat Miguel Ángel Jiménez with four singles matches still ongoing, to win 16–11. A tight contest in 2010 came down to the final singles match between European Graeme McDowell and American golfer Hunter Mahan. McDowell won his match with a hole to spare, to give Europe a 14–13 victory. Europe recovered a 10–6 deficit on the last day in 2012, as they won eight of the twelve singles matches to win 14–13.\nThe 2014 event held at Gleneagles Hotel on the PGA Centenary Course, resulted in a third successive victory for Europe. The 16–11 scoreline was their biggest since their 2008 success. The 2016 edition saw USA win 17–11 to secure their first victory since 2008. Europe regained the Ryder Cup in 2018 when they won 17–10 at Le Golf National in France.\nVenues.\nMaps of Ryder Cup venues.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

It was his first Wimbledon title and second major title overall. He became the first Briton to win the title since Fred Perry in 1936, ending a 77-year drought, as well as the first British winner in singles since Virginia Wade won the women's event in 1977. He was also the first Scot to win the title since Harold Mahony in 1896.\nRoger Federer was the defending champion, but lost in the second round to Sergiy Stakhovsky. Federer's loss marked the first time since the 2004 French Open that he failed to reach the quarterfinals at a major. It was his earliest exit in Wimbledon since 2002, and the first time he lost to a player ranked outside the top 100 since 2005.\nDjokovic advanced to the final after a five-set semifinal against Juan Martín del Potro. At 4 hours and 43 minutes this match was the then-longest semifinal ever contested at Wimbledon, breaking the previous record set by Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl in 1989.\nIn the first round, world No. 135 Steve Darcis defeated world No. 5 and two-time Wimbledon champion Rafael Nadal, the first time Nadal lost in the first round of a major. Federer and Nadal's early exits made this the first time since the 2004 French Open that neither of them appeared in the quarterfinals of a major, and the first time since 2002 that neither contested the Wimbledon final. For the first time since 1912, no Americans advanced past the second round.

        "text": "Marion Bartoli defeated Sabine Lisicki in the final, 6–1, 6–4 to win the ladies' singles tennis title at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. It was her first major title, and she won the title without losing a set, or facing a tiebreak in any set. Bartoli became the first French major champion since Amélie Mauresmo at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships. By winning her first major title on her 47th appearance, she broke the previous women's record of 45, set by Jana Novotná in 1998, for most appearances in majors before winning a title. This was also Bartoli's last major appearance, as she retired from professional tennis the following month.\nSerena Williams was the defending champion, but lost to Lisicki in the fourth round, ending a 34-match winning streak dating back to the Miami Open. It was only her third loss of the season, and her first since Doha. This was the fourth consecutive occasion where Lisicki defeated the reigning French Open champion at Wimbledon, following victories over Svetlana Kuznetsova in 2009, Li Na in 2011, and Maria Sharapova in 2012 (Lisicki did not play at Wimbledon in 2010).\nThe exits of Li Na and Petra Kvitová in the quarterfinals ensured a first-time major champion. Lisicki was the first German major finalist of either gender since Rainer Schüttler at the 2003 Australian Open, while Bartoli was the first Frenchwoman to contest a major final since herself in 2007.

        "text": "The 2013 United States Open Championship was the 113th U.S. Open, held June 13–16 at the East Course of Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, west of Philadelphia. Justin Rose won his first major title, two strokes ahead of runners-up Jason Day and Phil Mickelson.\nRose became the first player from England to win the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970, and the first to win any major since Nick Faldo won his third Masters in 1996. It was a record sixth runner-up finish for Mickelson and defending champion Webb Simpson tied for 32nd place. Inclement weather in the opening round delayed the completion of each of the first two rounds to the following day, and the average score in each of the four rounds exceeded 74 (+4). Shawn Stefani recorded the first-ever hole in one during a U.S. Open at Merion, acing the 17th on Sunday.\nVenue.\nThe 2013 U.S. Open was the fifth Open played at Merion's East Course, which opened in 1912. The past Open champions on the course were Olin Dutra in 1934, Ben Hogan in 1950, Lee Trevino in 1971, and David Graham in 1981. The course has also hosted the U.S. Amateur six times.\nField.\nAbout half the field consisted of players who are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open. Each player is classified according to the first category in which he qualified, and other categories are shown in parentheses.\n1. Winners of the U.S. Open Championship the last ten years\n2.

Given that the same tees were used, the previous two opens were also played over 6544 yds as the previous measurement of 6694 was incorrect.\nOne unique aspect of the course was that players began the first and second rounds on the 1st and 11th tees, rather than the 1st and 10th tees, as is typical. This was due to the 11th tee being more conveniently located relative to the practice range than the 10th tee. This was the second straight year the players did not begin rounds on the 10th tee as the first and second rounds started on the 1st and 9th tee the previous year at Olympic Club.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 13, 2013\"\n\"Friday, June 14, 2013\"\nDue to rain delays, the first round was not completed on Thursday; only the morning half of the field completed their rounds. Luke Donald was the overnight leader at −4, while Mickelson was the clubhouse leader at 67 (−3). When the first round was completed Friday morning, only five players were under par: Mickelson at 67 (−3), Donald and Mathew Goggin at 68 (−2) and Nicolas Colsaerts and Russell Knox at 69 (−1). Since 2008, the USGA has placed the top three players in the world rankings in the same grouping for the first two rounds. None of the three broke par in the first round: Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy shot 73 (+3) and Adam Scott 72 (+2). The scoring average for the field was 74.31, more than four strokes over par.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 14, 2013\"\n\"Saturday, June 15, 2013\"\nOn Friday, the second round was suspended due to darkness, with 68 players yet to complete their rounds. The leaders in the clubhouse were Mickelson and Billy Horschel, at 139 (−1). Horschel hit all 18 greens in regulation and shot a 67 (−3). When the second round was completed Saturday morning, Horschel and Mickelson still stood atop the leader board. Only six players shot under-par rounds, led by Horschel's 67. The scoring average for the second round was 75.13.\nAmateurs: \"Kim (+3), Pan (+4), Weaver (+8), Phelan (+8),\" Williams (+9), Fox (+10), Hall (+11), Homa (+11), McElyea (+20), Murray (+24)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 15, 2013\"\nMickelson shot an even-par round for 209 (−1) to stay atop the leaderboard, his second 54-hole lead at the U.S. Open. Hunter Mahan, Charl Schwartzel, and Steve Stricker were one shot back at even-par 210. As in the second round, only six players had under-par rounds, led by Rickie Fowler at 67. Woods struggled with his putting; after a birdie on the par-4 1st, he made seven bogeys to shoot 76 and fall to 219 (+9), ten strokes back. The scoring average for the third round was 74.36.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 16, 2013\"\nPhil Mickelson three-putted the third and fifth holes for double bogeys, but took back the lead with an eagle on the 10th. Justin Rose responded with birdies on the 12th and 13th. A bogey by Mickelson on the 13th gave Rose the lead.\nThrough 16 holes, Rose had five birdies and five bogeys and a one-shot lead over Mickelson. He managed par on the challenging final two holes, finishing with an even-par 70 for a 281 (+1) overall. Mickelson narrowly missed a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose and did not threaten to birdie either of the final two holes. A missed long par putt on 18 dropped him to +3 overall and into a tie with Jason Day for second place.\nFor Rose, it was his first major title. He completed the tournament without any double bogeys. On his win, Rose commented \"It feels fantastic. I committed myself to the process this week. I committed myself to putting a strategy in place that I hoped would work in five-to-10 years in delivering major championships ... it's a moment where you can look back and think childhood dreams have come true.\" He was the first English player to win the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970, and the first to win any major since Nick Faldo won the 1996 Masters. Rose, who entered the tournament ranked fifth in the world, moved up to third as a result of the win.\nFor Mickelson, it was his sixth runner-up finish at the U.S. Open, an event record. He has never won the event and called the loss heartbreaking: \"this is tough to swallow after coming so close ... I felt like this was as good an opportunity I could ask for and to not get it ... it hurts.\"\nMahan was tied for the lead as late as the 14th hole before going +4 on the last four holes and dropping into a four-way tie for fourth, four strokes back. Jason Dufner shot a 67 (−3) despite a triple-bogey on 15 to tie Mahan, Horschel, and Ernie Els. Hideki Matsuyama also shot a 67 with six birdies to finish in a tie for tenth. Schwartzel started the day one shot back, but a 78 dropped him outside the top 10.\nShawn Stefani recorded the first-ever hole-in-one during a U.S. Open at Merion, acing the 17th. His 4-iron tee shot bounced off the slope left of the green and rolled a considerable distance into the cup. The scoring average for the fourth round was 74.05.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "Ross Brown (rugby union)",
        "text": "Ross Handley Brown (8 September 1934 – 20 May 2014) was a New Zealand rugby union footballer. He played 16 test matches (25 total games), most frequently in the first-five back position, for New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, from 1955 until 1962.\nCareer.\nRoss Brown, one of the finest backs produced by Taranaki where he was always affectionately known as \"Pascoe,\" ended his long, illustrious career, both for his province and the All Blacks, as something of a paradox. Brown's career which embraced 207 first class games, and well in excess of 100 for Taranaki, came in two distinct stages.\nIn the first, between 1955 and 1962, either first five-eighth or in the midfield at either centre or second five, he was a regular All Black selection. Yet then he was frequently criticised for being too much of a runner and not possessing a good enough kicking game.\nIn his second phase, from 1963 until he retired four or five years later, he was criticised, but this time, much to the bemusement of the genial Brown himself, he was constantly under attack for what was seen as excessive use of the boot.\nThis undoubtedly stemmed from the leading role he had as the captain and first five in the Taranaki side which held the Ranfurly Shield between 1963–65. Brown was a potent weapon for Taranaki with his suddenly found talent for dropped goals. He landed 10 alone in the 1964 season, including three in a shield defence against North Auckland.\nThat Brown should be regarded as primarily a kicker was ironic, particularly for the man himself. As a youngster he had always been a runner and even in his latter years would have loved to have been seen more as an attacker. Rather than being remembered as a marksman dropkicker Brown got more pleasure from the fact he scored 70-odd tries in his first class career and created many others.\nIn the mid 1960s Brown was regarded by his Taranaki coach and close friend, John Stewart, as being at the top of his game. Yet because he was now perceived as being only a kicker he found himself left out of All Black sides and being judged as not fitting the 15-man game being advocated by the then coach, Fred Allen.\nBrown, however, had had the satisfaction of a rewarding career and a lengthy stint as an All Black, especially in the mid to late 1950s.\nBrown had an excellent rugby pedigree, being the son of Handley, a three quarter in the famous 1924-25 Invincibles, and was the nephew of Henry, also an All Black three quarter on the 1935-36 tour of Britain.\nFrom his first XV days as a boarder at Auckland's King's College (1st XV 1951–52, 1st XI captain and athletics champion) it was clear that Brown was an outstanding rugby talent and while still a teenager made his debut for Taranaki in 1953 and one year later played for the North in the annual interisland match.\nAged only 20, he received his first test cap as a centre against the Wallabies at Eden Park in 1955. He was in the midfield for the opening three tests against the 1956 Springboks but moved into five-eighth during the third test at Lancaster Park.\nHe immediately placed a precise cross kick which produced a try for left wing Ron Jarden and remained at fly half for the fourth test a fortnight later at Eden Park.\nEven though in those years he was usually at centre for Taranaki, particularly during the 1957-59 shield reign, Brown was pretty much the All Blacks' first choice at fly half for the next two or three seasons. Unfortunately, for family reasons he was not available for the 1960 tour of South Africa.\nBut he regained his All Black place for the 1961 test series against France playing at second five. He made the tour of Australia a year later but then dropped out of national reckoning despite continuing to be a key player for Taranaki for many subsequent years. He was named the Taranaki Sportsman of the Year in the inaugural Taranaki Sports Awards in 1965.\nIn all Brown played 25 matches for the All Blacks including 16 tests, one regret from his international career being the fact he never went on one of the landmark major tours of his time to either South Africa or Britain and France. He toured only twice with the All Blacks, to Australia, in 1957 and 1962, but was also a member of the powerful New Zealand Under 23 team that toured Hong Kong and Japan in 1958.\nHis brother Don represented Taranaki 1954 and King Country 1957 whilst his son Andrew played for Ma.nawatu 1985 and Taranaki 1986.\nThe Ross Brown Shield competition was first played for in 1976 by teams from the four home zones of the Northern Taranaki Primary Schools Rugby Union. Dave McColl, at the time the Primary Schools Rugby Union Chairman and TRFU executive member and Brown, who donated the trophy, were instrumental in putting together the foundations of the event which has grown into an important part of the rugby calendar.\nBrown died in New Plymouth on 20 May 2014."

        "title": "List of international rugby union tries by Shane Williams",
        "text": "Shane Williams is a Welsh rugby union player who appeared 87 times for the Wales national team from 2000 to 2011. Playing exclusively as a wing for Wales, Williams scored 58 tries, the most for any Wales international and 13 more than second-placed George North. Williams also made four appearances for the British &amp; Irish Lions, three as a wing and one as a centre. Williams scored two tries for the Lions, both from the wing during their victory over South Africa (also known as the 'Springboks') in the third Test of their 2009 tour of South Africa. At his retirement, Williams' 60 international tries placed him third on the worldwide all-time list, trailing Daisuke Ohata of Japan and David Campese of Australia; , he stands fourth, with South Africa's Bryan Habana having surpassed Williams and Campese for second place.\nWilliams made his international debut on 5 February 2000 against France in the opening round of the 2000 Six Nations Championship at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. His first try for Wales came in the next round of the Six Nations against Italy, also at Millennium Stadium. Williams went on to score tries in the 2003, 2007 and 2011 editions of the World Cup. His final try for Wales came literally at the end of his international career, as he scored on the final play of his last Test on 3 December 2011 against Australia at Millennium Stadium. This try was his 28th at Millennium Stadium, surpassing Rory Underwood of England, with 27 at Twickenham, for the most international tries scored by a player from one of the ten \"Tier 1\" nations at a single ground. Among players from all nations, Williams is level with Ohata, who scored 28 tries at Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium in Tokyo.\nWilliams holds several other try records, both for Wales and internationally. His 30 tries away from his home country (including those at neutral sites) were the most for any player in history at the time of his retirement, though that record has since been broken by Habana. He leads Wales in tries at home (30), away (21), on neutral ground (7), and in the Rugby World Cup (10). Williams was most prolific against Italy, Japan and Scotland, scoring nine tries against each team; he retired with the record for most tries by an opposing player against each of these nations. He also retired with the most tries by any European player against both Australia (6) and South Africa (5). All of his tries against the Springboks were on South African soil, which at the time of his retirement tied him with New Zealanders Christian Cullen and Joe Rokocoko for the most overall. His six tries against Argentina left him level with France's Serge Blanco and Émile Ntamack for the most by a European player.\nWilliams has scored multiple tries in a single international match on 14 occasions, including two hat-tricks. The first of these was a four-try effort against Japan at Kintetsu Hanazono Rugby Stadium in Osaka during a 2001 Wales tour. The second was against Argentina at José Amalfitani Stadium in Buenos Aires during Wales' 2004 tour. Williams scored tries against 14 countries, including all of the other nine \"Tier 1\" nations."

        "text": "Ilkley Golf Club is a golf club in North Yorkshire, England, just outside the town of Ilkley in West Yorkshire. It is located about a mile to the northwest of Ilkley and southeast of Addingham. The River Wharfe flows past the course. It was established in 1890.\nHistory.\nIlkley is the oldest club in the West Riding and the third oldest in Yorkshire (Beverly and East Riding Golf Club 1889); a 9-hole course was established on Rombald's Moor at the behest of Ben Hirst and Alfred Potter in June 1890. The location for the original 9-hole course was planned with assistance from George Strath, the club professional at Southport and George Kay, the club professional at Redcar was employed at £1 per week to lay out the course.\nIn October 1897 the committee negotiated with Myddleton Estate to rent 70 acres of pasture running along the north side of the River Wharfe. Work began on the new course in February 1898 and was completed by July of that year. The course was designed by Alister MacKenzie and Harry Colt and measures 6,262 yards. The old links course on the moor was leased to an Ilkley Tradesmen's group and golf continued to be played there until the Moor Club was wound up in 1947. On 13 April 1907, Harry Vardon and noted golf architect James Braid played an exhibition match to mark the opening of the new clubhouse. In 1921 the course was described as an \"excellent links\" course. In 1970 many trees were planted around the course, changing its appearance. The club has hosted the competition for the OCCA and West Riding Golf Trophies, the Yorkshire Ladies' Challenge Bowl in 1955 and the British Girls' Open Championship in 1969.\nThe 19th bar in the Clubhouse has on display one of the golf balls that Alan Shepard took to the Moon on Apollo 14 in 1971. The ball was given by Shephard to Father Paddy Roche who bequeathed it to the club.\nMembers.\nA number of professionals started or played at Ilkley, including Harry Vardon, Tom Vardon, Sam Whiting, William Baxter, John Ball, Peter Thomson, Bill Ferguson, Colin Montgomerie, Mark James, and James Hepworth. Harry Vardon won his first prize as a professional golfer on this course in 1893. Montgomerie met Ferguson at the club when Ferguson was club pro and Montgomerie was just a boy.\nReferences.\nSaywell, J., (1990) A History Of Ilkley Golf Club, Otley, Smith Settle."

        "text": "The 2005 Giro d'Italia was the 88th edition of the cycle race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro began in Reggio Calabria with a prologue individual time trial on 7 May, and Stage 10 occurred on 18 May with a flat stage to Rossano Veneto. The race finished in Milan on 29 May.\nPrologue.\nThe prologue was a individual time trial. It was won by the Australian Brett Lancaster with a 0.289 second advantage over Matteo Tosatto, who scored second. After the last rider, Mario Cipollini received the homage of the Italian cycling world, doing the 1.15 kilometer race out of competition. He had announced his retirement just ten days before.\nStage 1.\nAt the beginning of the first stage, a four-man breakaway formed and led by almost ten minutes at one point. Thorwald Veneberg was finally captured again about 20 kilometers before the end. However, his efforts paid by giving him the first \"maglia Verde\" of the Giro. On the last kilometer Paolo Bettini managed to get away on a very steep gradient.\nStage 2.\nHaving been defeated by Paolo Bettini and Robbie McEwen on the previous stage, Italian favorite Alessandro Petacchi failed yet again in the bunch sprint in Santa Maria Del Cedro. This time, he claimed, he had been forced to change his direction because of Estonian Jaan Kirsipuu.\nStage 3.\nJust as in the first stage, the sprinter's teams were not able to stop a breakaway in the last kilometers of the race. This time, it was a group of fifty riders which included all the GC important riders. Danilo DI Luca, in a great form in season 2005, beat fellow Italian Damiano Cunego in the sprint for the stage victory.\nStage 4.\nPaolo Bettini won the sprint at the end which was fought between five cyclists. But in this process he caused Baden Cooke to fall and was declassified because of this. Luca Mazzanti, who came in second, inherited the victory. After the stage, Bettini threatened to abandon the race, but it turned out to be an empty threat.\nStage 5.\nDanilo DI Luca got his second stage victory in 2005 Giro d'Italia, notching this win ahead of Fassa Bortolo's Marzio Bruseghin. Otherwise, this stage had no important influence on the fight for General Classification.\nStage 6.\nJust as Danilo DI Luca had done the previous day, Australian Robbie McEwen took his second win in this year's Giro. This time, he did not have to beat Alessandro Petacchi, since the Italian's \"Torino biancoblù\" de-railed, causing the fall of some of the Fassa Bortolo riders, and forcing \"Ale-Jet\" to halt to a stop. McEwen's teammate Henk Vogels attacked in the last kilometer, but was surpassed just at the finish line by up to four other cyclists.\nStage 7.\nAfter a long breakaway, lasting throughout most of the stage, Spaniard Koldo Gil was the first to arrive at the finish line in Pistoia. Damiano Cunego, who was second, leading a pursuing group, celebrated thinking he had won the stage, not knowing that Gil had already taken the victory. Ivan Basso, who had been forced to change his bicycle because of a puncture in the last climb of the day, lost thirty seconds to his rivals for GC.\nStage 8.\nThe eighth stage was a time trial. Danilo DI Luca came in tenth and was able to keep the Maglia Rosa. Otherwise, this stage meant the victory for American David Zabriskie, and the revival of his teammate Ivan Basso, second in the time trial, and who made up for all the time he had lost the day before and even more. On the other hand, this was a very bad day for both Lampre riders Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.\nStage 9.\nAlessandro Petacchi got his first victory in the 2005 Giro. Paolo Bettini and Swiss Aurélien Clerc had a great performance at this stage, surpassing pure sprinters such as Robbie McEwen or Erik Zabel.\nStage 10.\nOn the stage after the race's first rest day, Robbie McEwen took vengeance on Alessandro Petacchi in a bunch sprint. The bunch spring had to be solved with the aid of the photo-finish, which determined that the Australian had beaten the Italian by a mere question of millimeters."

        "text": "The 2005 Giro d'Italia was the 88th edition of the cycle race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro began in Reggio Calabria with a prologue individual time trial on 7 May, and Stage 11 occurred on 19 May with a mountainous stage from Marostica. The race finished in Milan on 29 May. The winner of the race was Paolo Savoldelli.\nStage 11.\nAlready one kilometer after the start, Benoît Joachim raced away from the field. After about 100 kilometers, shortly after the first mountain standing which Joachim won, he was captured by the field. Twenty-six kilometers before the end, and following an attack by \"Gibo\" Simoni, Ivan Basso raced away with only very few riders able to keep up. Only Paolo Savoldelli, who had picked up a twenty seconds advantage on the descent and therefore was able to reserve strengths, could stand Basso's rhythm, and he beat the Varesian rider at the summit of Zoldo Alto. Simoni came up 21 seconds later, but defending champion Damiano Cunego lost around six minutes and was ruled out from the list of contenders.\nStage 12.\nAlessandro Petacchi's efforts during winter, striving to gain ability in the mountains, paid off just as they had done in Milan–San Remo, enabling him to recover from the gruelous Dolomiti stage far better than any of his opponents, and the Italian from Fassa Bortolo sprinted to his second victory in this Giro.\nStage 13.\nColombian Iván Parra won the stage in St. Ulrich by breaking ahead of his fellow breakaways on the previous climb. Spaniard Juanma Gárate, fourth in the 2004 Giro d'Italia, came in second. As for the GC, Ivan Basso, with gastrical problems, lost one minute and the \"maglia rosa\" to \"Il Falco\" Paolo Savoldelli.\nStage 14.\nIt was in this stage that Ivan Basso's illness was really going to take its toll. Upon the first gradients of the Stelvio Pass, \"Cima Coppi\" of this edition, the Team CSC rider was left behind and unable to react because of his health problems. He lost eighteen minutes to the other GC riders. Savoldelli lost time to Simoni and Di Luca, who arrived in Livigno 3' 15\" later than Iván Parra, scored an impressive Dolomiti double.\nStage 15.\nThis stage, originally 205 kilometres long, was reduced to a length of 147 kilometres due to bad weather conditions at Forcola di Livigno, one of the mountain climbs that the peloton had to go through that day. Alessandro Petacchi, after the abandon of sprinters such as Baden Cooke, Robbie McEwen, Stuart O'Grady or Jaan Kirsipuu, had only Erik Zabel to challenge him, but the Italian's speed was too much for the veteran T-Mobile rider.\nStage 16.\nAfter the second rest-day, the peloton did not want to spend too much energies on a flat stage, so it was easy for a break-away of eighteen men to gather an advantage of 10 minutes. Amongst these breakaways, there was Crédit Agricole rider Christophe Le Mével, who outpowered his fellow breakaways to notch up his first pro victory."

NC State returned its top four leading scorers from the 2011-12 season in C. J. Leslie (14.7 ppg), Lorenzo Brown (12.7 ppg), Scott Wood (12.4 ppg) and Richard Howell (10.8 ppg). In addition, NC State landed Rodney Purvis, Tyler Lewis, and T. J. Warren to wrap up a Top 10 recruiting class. ESPN’s Andy Katz had the Wolfpack as the top rated ACC squad, at No. 6, in his early predictions. His counterpart, Sports Illustrated’s Luke Winn, had the Wolfpack listed as the No. 5 team in the nation according to his power rankings.

        "text": "The Portuguese Volleyball Super Cup or Supertaça de Portugal is an annual Portuguese volleyball competition played by the champions of the Campeonato Nacional de Voleibol and the winners of the Taça de Portugal de Voleibol. It is organized by the Federação Portuguesa de Voleibol and its first edition (won by Benfica) took place in 1990. Sporting CP won the next three, with Castêlo da Maia and Sporting de Espinho dominating the next eight years, winning four titles each. In 2002, the tournament was interrupted and only resumed in 2010, with Castêlo da Maia winning its fifth. From 2011 to 2016, Benfica won six Supertaças in a row, becoming the most honoured club in the competition, currently with 12 trophies.\nHistory.\nThe competition was created in 1989 by the Portuguese Volleyball Federation, to serve as \"curtain-raiser\" for the season, in similar fashion to what other Super cup's do. Its first winner was Leixões, the national and cup champions, completing a treble. The following year was won by Benfica, in an edition named \"Taça Federação\", or Federation's Cup, played by multiple teams. The following three were won by Sporting CP and from then on, the \"Supertaça\" was only won by two clubs: Sporting de Espinho and Castêlo da Maia. They intercalated wins, and both bagged four wins each. In 2002 the competition stopped being contested and only returned in 2010 after a nine–year hiatus. On 5 October 2010, at the Pavilhão Municipal da Póvoa de Vazim, Castêlo da Maia and Sporting de Espinho decided who held the title as most honoured in the competition. The Maia-side won 3–1 and conquered their fifth Super cup, unlocking the tiebreaker.\nExactly one year later, Cup winners Benfica met débutantes Fonte Bastardo, the reigning league Champions on the Pavilhão do Casal Vistoso. The match ended with a win for Benfica, who lifted the trophy for the first time in 21 years. In the following year, Benfica faced Sporting de Espinho, a team that had beaten them five months before in the league final. On the hardwood, Benfica revenged that loss and won 3–0, lifting their third Super Cup. In the 15th edition, Benfica and Fonte Bastardo reunited in Pavilhão de Desportos de Vila do Conde to contest another \"Supertaça\". In a much more exciting encounter than before, Benfica and Fonte Bastardo required five sets to decide the game, with Benfica winning the last one by 15–12. On 11 October 2014, Castêlo da Maia discussed the 16th edition with Benfica at the Pavilhão Multidesportos Mário Mexia in Coimbra. Castelo failed to defend their trophy lead in the competition and lost with Benfica; who subsequently matched them with five wins. A year later on 3 October 2015, Benfica won their fifth Super cup in a row, after defeating Sporting de Espinho by 3–0 in Coimbra. Hugo Gaspar scored 18 points and was the man of the match. In the 2016 edition, Benfica extended their streak to six wins, after beating Fonte Bastardo on Pavilhão Cidade de Viseu by 3–0. Benfica's streak ended in 2017 at Pavilhão Cidade de Almada with a 3–2 loss to Sporting de Espinho. On 5 October 2018, Benfica defeated Sporting by 3–0 to claim their eight Super Cup in Pavilhão Desportivo Póvoa de Varzim."

        "title": "Portuguese Handball League Cup",
        "text": "The Handball League Cup or \"Taça da Liga de Andebol\" was a handball competition disputed by the top clubs of the Liga Portuguesa de Andebol. Founded in 2003 by the \"Liga Portuguesa de Andebol (LPA)\", it ran for six years. The first two editions were won by FC Porto, followed by Belenenses and SL Benfica in 2006 and 2007. The final two editions were won by Porto and Benfica. Sporting has the most finals lost with three. In 2009, the LPA ended and the League Cup was replaced by Portuguese Handball Super Cup.\nHistory.\nThe idea to create a second domestic cup after Portuguese Handball Cup came from the conflict between Portuguese Handball Federation and the \"Liga Portuguesa de Andebol (Portuguese Handball League)\" in 2002. The latter controlled the Divisão de Elite, a closed professional league, while the Federation controlled all others competitions. In 2003, LPA expanded their influence and created their own cup, the \"Taça da Liga (League Cup)\". The first edition was played in the weekend of 6 and 7 December 2003 in the Pavilhão Municipal de Grijó. Four clubs contested the tournament, FC Porto, ABC Braga, Águas Santas and Sporting. In the semi-finals, Sporting beat Águas Santas by 24–21, while Porto defeated ABC by 32–26. The following day, Carlos Resende scored 13 goals for Porto in a 31–28 win over Sporting. The second edition took place in the Nave Polivalente de Espinho, on 11 and 12 December 2004. Repeated contestants, Porto and ABC Braga were joined by two new one's, Belenenses and Sporting de Espinho. Porto reached their second consecutive final after defeating the home team by 30–25; while in the other game, ABC surpassed Belenenses by 34–27 to qualify for the first time. In the final, Porto beat ABC by 31–23 and added another trophy to its cabinet. The third edition was decided on 12 February 2006 at the Pavilhão Municipal de Idanha-a-Nova, where Belenenses defeated Maia team, Águas Santas by 25–24. The day before, Águas Santas had beat Porto, preventing them from reaching a three-peat.\nFor the subsequent editions, the tournament moved to the Portimão Arena. The first edition played there was in the weekend of 27 and 28 January 2007. In the semi-finals, new entrance Benfica beat arch-rivals Sporting by 27–23, while Águas Santas exacted revenge from their loss in the previous edition by defeating Belenenses by 26–24. On the final, Benfica aided by Georgi Zaikin, recovered from a three-goal deficit to beat Águas Santas by 33–23 and win their first title since the \"Supertaça\" in 1994. In the fifth edition, eight teams battled for the trophy; Águas Santas–Sporting de Espinho, Sporting–Benfica, ISAVE–Sporting da Horta, São Bernardo–Madeira SAD. After passing the quarter-finals, Sporting met ABC in the semis and beat them by 28–15. They would face Porto, who qualified for their third final, after overpowering São Bernardo by 26–17. On 2 March 2008, Porto defeated Sporting by 23–18 and claimed their third win in the competition, the second against the same opponent. In the sixth edition, the competition was played in a league format, with Benfica and Sporting qualifying for the final. On 18 January 2009, Benfica won the competition for a second time after defeating Sporting by 29–25 in Portimão. With the end of the \"Liga Portuguesa de Andebol\" in 2009, the competition ceased to exist. Its competitive space was taken over by the Portuguese Handball Super Cup, run by the Federation."

China were the defending champions. The Netherlands took silver, and the United States bronze, in 2004. In Beijing, China was again victorious, while the US and the Netherlands switched places to ascend the podium with silver and bronze, respectively.\nThis was the third Summer Paralympic Games without standing volleyball events, which had been included from the introduction of volleyball in 1976 (when sitting volleyball was a demonstration event) through 2000.\nClassification.\nIn sitting volleyball there are two categories of classification: disabled and minimal disability. A maximum of one minimally disabled player may be on the court for each team at any one time.\nA part of the player's body between the buttocks and the shoulders must be in contact with the court when playing or attempting to play the ball.\nQualification.\nThere were 18 teams, 10 men's teams and 8 women's teams, taking part.

        "text": "The Atlantic Cup is the first and only dedicated Class40 professional sailing race in the United States. It consists of both offshore and inshore legs and was created by Manuka Sports Event Management, which is headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island.\nHugh Piggin, a New Zealand native and sailor who lives in Newport, was intent on changing the face of sailing in the United States. After joining forces with Julianna Barbieri, a sports broadcasting professional, the two created a business plan that would eventually form the Atlantic Cup.\nThe first edition of the race was in 2011. Entrants started in New York City and finished in Newport, with an additional inshore series that was also held in Newport. The race expanded in 2012 to start from Charleston, South Carolina.\nThe Atlantic Cup competition has three stages: two offshore legs and an inshore series. From 2011-2014, the first stage was a 648 nautical mile double-handed leg from Charleston to New York City. The second stage was a 231 nautical mile leg from New York City to Newport. The third and final stage was sailed with a maximum crew of six for a weekend-long inshore series. Beginning in 2016, the Atlantic Cup extended the Leg 2 course to 360 nautical miles with a finish in Portland, Maine. Points are awarded for each race, and the team with the fewest overall combined points from both the offshore and inshore series is crowned Atlantic Cup Champion. \nThe 2012 race was the first carbon neutral sailing race in the United States. To achieve carbon neutrality, race organizers adopted a 3-part approach: on-land, on-water, and education. On land, single-use plastic water bottles are prohibited. Only glassware or biodegradable cups are used, and recycle stations and water filtration systems for both crew members and guests alike are set up in all three race locations. Event management uses only \"100% post-consumer recycled paper\" that is used for the printing of collateral material such as event packets, tickets, and handouts. In 2016, the Atlantic Cup was the first sporting event in the United States to be ISO 20121 compliant.\n2016 Race Results\n2014 Race Results\n2013 Race Results\n2012 Race Results\n2011 Race Results"

He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) in Test matches and One Day International (ODI) matches on 11 and 20 occasions respectively during his international career. He played 55 Tests and 247 ODIs for Pakistan scoring 4,052 and 8,824 runs respectively. He was described by the BBC as \"a world-class opener\" and \"one of the real batting stars of Pakistani cricket\". Anwar was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year, in 1997, and the cricket almanac \"Wisden\" noted his \"rapid run-scoring\".\nAnwar made his Test debut against the West Indies in a match where he was dismissed without scoring in either innings at the Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad in 1990.

His highest Test score of 188 not out came against India during the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata in February 1999. In the same innings, he became the third Pakistan opening batsman not to be dismissed at the close of an innings. Anwar scored Test centuries against seven different opponents at ten cricket grounds, including seven at venues outside Pakistan.

The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).\nJessica MacDonald from the host nation won the gold medal."

        "title": "2013 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 2013 State of Origin series was the 32nd time the annual best-of-three series between the Queensland and New South Wales rugby league teams was played entirely under 'state of origin' rules. It was the first series to be administered by the Australian Rugby League Commission which was created in a major re-structure of the sport's administration in Australia.\nQueensland were to host two home matches this year, however the ARLC Commission announced in November 2012 a new five-year cycle which would see New South Wales instead host two home matches this year, as well as in 2016, the Maroons to host two home matches in 2014 and 2017 and the remaining match in 2015 to be hosted at a neutral venue.\nFormer Canberra, Queensland and Australian captain Mal Meninga continued on as coach of the Queensland side, looking to continue his winning run having won the previous seven series. New South Wales was coached by former Canberra, NSW and Australia captain Laurie Daley, who took over from yet another former Canberra, NSW and Australia teammate Ricky Stuart who moved on from State of Origin duty following the 2012 series to coach Parramatta.\nQueensland won the State of Origin series by winning two of the three matches; thus stretching their record-breaking State of Origin winning streak to eight years and thus defending their shield. Cameron Smith won the Wally Lewis Medal for being the best player in the series.\nThe 2013 series set a new State of Origin television ratings record for a whole series since the 2001 introduction of the ratings system.\nGame I.\nLike both of his predecessor as New South Wales coach Craig Bellamy and Ricky Stuart, Laurie Daley was brought in to coach against Mal Meninga, who captained Canberra to their premiership in 1990 NSWRL season when all three played under him. The Blues team to play in the opening game for the 2013 series saw a host of changes from the incumbent side from game three last year. Four debutants were selected by Daley to join the squad: Blake Ferguson, James Maloney, Andrew Fifita and Josh Reynolds. Current Sydney Roosters and former New Zealand Warriors five-eighth Maloney replaced Todd Carney to partner Mitchell Pearce in the halves, keeping with the same halves partnership for the Roosters so far in the 2013 NRL season and continuing the trend where no incumbent NSW five-eighth since 2000-2001 has gone on to play in the first game of the following series. Ferguson, who usually plays centre for his club and in other representative matches, made his debut on the right wing whilst Cronulla forward Fifita earned his spot on the interchange. Reynolds joined the squad late in preparation after winning an audition between him and Rabbitohs player John Sutton, who were selected by Daley to fill the vacant interchange spot left by Kurt Gidley after he withdrew from the squad due to injury shortly after the team was announced.\nOther major changes to the NSW team included Jarryd Hayne moving from the wing to replace the injured Brett Stewart at fullback. Captain Paul Gallen moved back into the front-row making way for Ryan Hoffman to return to the Blues squad for the first time since 2008.\nThe Blues started off strongly in Game 1 with a try to Jarryd Hayne in the 5th minute seeing them 6-0 in front. Subsequent penalties saw the Blues extend the lead to 8-0 after Maloney kicked a penalty goal in the 19th minute. Jennings pounced on a loose ball that came from a repeat set and scored under the posts after ploughing through 5 defenders. This saw the Blues with a 14-0 lead at the break.\nQueensland came up with several opportunities to score in the first half including Boyd almost crossing in the corner, however the Blues defence came rushing in every time to defuse any chance.\nTempers flared seconds from half time when Gallen landed two punches at Myles sending him on report.\nDarius Boyd scored in the corner for Queensland in the 61st minute making the score 14-6. This would be the final result in the game with all the points being scored on the southern end of the field.\nAfter the match due to criticism of the match officials for not sending Paul Gallen to the sin bin but placing him on report for punching Nate Myles the NRL introduced an automatic sin bin for anyone throwing a punch.\nGame II.\nThe announced Maroons squad for game two saw significant changes to their forward pack and interchange. Long time Queensland campaigners prop forward David Shillington and lock Ashley Harrison were dropped in favor of Nate Myles and Corey Parker respectively, whilst Chris McQueen was promoted from the bench to fill Myles' second row spot. Manly Sea Eagles halfback Daly Cherry-Evans and Canberra Raiders second rower Josh Papalii made their debuts on the bench after both were standing reserves for the first match.\nThere were minimal changes for the Blues squad in the second game in the series. Josh Dugan, who earlier in the season was sacked from the Canberra Raiders for repeated off field disciplinary issues then subsequently signed for the St George Illawarra Dragons almost two months later, took up the fullback spot due to Jarryd Hayne succumbing to a club game injury whilst Brett Stewart remained unavailable for selection. Wests Tigers prop forward Aaron Woods replaced James Tamou in the front row who was suspended from the match after he was charged with high-range drink driving. Winger Blake Ferguson was also stood down from the squad shortly after he was announced in consequence of a publicized off field drama where he was charged with indecent assault. Ferguson's replacement was Nathan Merritt who made his debut at age 30. The match also happened to coincide with the Change in Prime Minister of Australia, most notably delaying the start of the match by 15 minutes. This led to the pre-match entertainment of the Stafford Brothers to be extended by 10 minutes.\nIn the second half, after a fight broke out in the ruck four players were sin-binned: Queensland's Brent Tate and Justin Hodges, and New South Wales' Trent Merrin and Greg Bird. This ruling was roundly criticized by former State of Origin greats in post-game analysis.\nGame III.\nNew South Wales captain Paul Gallen was unable to recover from a sustained injury and was subsequently ruled out of the series decider. James Tamou returned from disciplinary suspension to rejoin the front-row and replace Gallen, whilst Robbie Farah was handed the captaincy role. Other changes saw James McManus and Boyd Cordner replace Nathan Merritt on the wing and Josh Reynolds on the bench, respectively. Fullback Jarryd Hayne was once again ruled out due to an ongoing hamstring injury. No changes in game three were made for Queensland.\nQueensland extended their record to eight consecutive series in a decider that featured a streaker, and the post-Olympics attendance record for Stadium Australia. The attendance of 83,813 beat the previous record of 83,702 set just 10 days earlier for a rugby union Test between The Wallabies and the British &amp; Irish Lions. Unlike in the first two games, the decider was closely contested in the first half with both sides getting across the line inside the first half-hour. In the 10th minute, Johnathan Thurston weaved his way through some lazy Blues defence after a shift to the left broke down, to score next to the posts. He converted his own try to give the Maroons a 6-0 lead. The ensuing set resulted in Thurston adding another 2 points after James Maloney was penalised for a shoulder charge on the kicker Cooper Cronk. QLD lead 8-0 after 15 minutes. The Blues hit back in the 25th minute after consecutive penalties and some clever work by Josh Morris saw James McManus score in the corner. The conversion by James Maloney was unsuccessful leaving the score at 8-4 and that's how it remained at half time, with Queensland producing some desperate defence to prevent NSW from scoring.\nBoth sides started the second half in a rather pensive mood before NSW seemed to gain the ascendancy in field position and general flow of the match. That changed at the 60 minute mark after repeated errors by the Blues lead to QLD receiving their first penalty in over 40 minutes. The Maroons capitalised on this opportunity with Justin Hodges scoring off a deft short ball from Cooper Cronk. Johnathan Thurston missed the sideline conversion keeping the scores at 12-4. With just over 10 minutes to go Trent Merrin steadied some disorganised play by straightening and barging through a terrible attempted tackle by Corey Parker, to score right under the sticks. James Maloney made no mistake with the conversion taking the score to 12-10. The Blues looked to go on the attack from the ensuing restart, gaining 60m in 4 plays before a badly misdirected pass from Mitchell Pearce ricocheted off Josh Dugan's shoulder and cost the Blues 15m. James Maloney ended up hoisting the ball into the heavens which Billy Slater climbed high to mark with Ryan Hoffman and Andrew Fifita giving away a penalty for tackling him in the air. The Maroons proceeded cautiously with only 5 minutes left on the clock. Realising the shortage of time, Robbie Farah attempted to kick for a 40/20 to give the Blues one last crack at QLD's line but came up short. Darius Boyd returned the kick in fantastic fashion making a 40m run leaving several NSW chasers in his wake. Cameron Smith then ducked down a short side making a break before passing to Corey Parker who in-turn offloaded the ball back to his captain who made a determined charge for the NSW line only to be brought down inches short. With the Blues shot defensively, QLD looked to shift the ball before a streaker who by then had run 80m to get in the way of play tripped over and fell right amongst the players. QLD ended up getting across the line through Matt Scott but was disallowed the try because of the interference to play. The resulting decision, a neutral infringement, afforded QLD a scrum with the loose head and feed given their superior field position. It ended with James Maloney taking a superb reflex catch of a Johnathan Thurston kick. The ball came out to the Blues captain Farah who then went for the all or nothing kick across field which James McManus was unable to take, knocking the ball into touch. QLD retained their shield and extended their dynasty to 8 straight Origin series victories. Cameron Smith was awarded the Wally Lewis medal for player of the series.\nTeams.\nThe 18th &amp; 19th man are reserves to cover for any forthcoming injuries and, unless chosen, do not actually play.\nNew South Wales Blues.\n1 - Blake Ferguson was originally selected to play in game two but was withdrawn after being suspended by the NRL.

        "title": "Mid-year rugby union internationals",
        "text": "\"For the most recent Mid-year window go to 2022 July rugby union tests\"\nThe July Tests, also known as the summer Tests or mid-year Tests, are international rugby union matches played around the month of July each year. They include traditional summer tours by European nations to countries in the southern hemisphere, North America or Japan, as well as shorter international trips and one-off test matches. They follow the end of the domestic rugby season for northern hemisphere countries. In 2008, the International Rugby Board (IRB) introduced a three-weekend window in June during which players are required to be released by their clubs for international matches. From 2020 due to changes to the World Rugby international calendar, the window will be moved to July.\nMid-year tests since 2004.\n2004.\nAustralia hosted a tour by Scotland and won 2-0, while New Zealand won their home series against England by the same score. Ireland made a tour of South Africa, losing their 2-0. The Pacific Islanders (made up of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa players) played Australia, New Zealand and South Africa once each, losing all 3 matches. Wales toured Argentina, drawing 1-1. France visited the US and Canada, playing one test against each, and winning both.\n2005.\n2005 saw the British &amp; Irish Lions undertake their first tour of New Zealand since 1993. New Zealand comprehensively won 3-0. Ireland and Wales toured with teams weakened by players representing the Lions; Wales won one test each against the USA and Canada, while Japan were defeated 2–0 by Ireland. Japan had previously visited Uruguay and Argentina, losing one test to each.\nAustralia won home tests against Samoa, Italy and France. Australia then played South Africa twice, home and away, with the home team winning each time. South Africa hosted a two-test series against France, winning 1-0 with one match drawn. Italy also toured Argentina, drawing a two-test series 1-1.\n2006.\nNotes:\n2011.\nThis was the first time since 1973, and only the second in the past 50 years, that none of the Home nations, or the British &amp; Irish Lions, toured the southern hemisphere in the summer. Instead, there were warm-up matches ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand.\n2012.\nIn 2012 the IRB formalised a global rugby calendar, which will run until 2019. The calendar includes a return of some traditional tours by European teams, in which a team plays multiple tests against a southern hemisphere side, often with mid-week matches against provincial or regional sides.\nEngland and Wales beat the Barbarians, with only Wales awarding caps, before touring South Africa and Australia respectively.\nSouth Africa hosted England for three tests, the first extended tour there since the Lions' 1997 tour, and won the series 2-0, with one draw.\nAustralia hosted Wales, playing their first three-test home series since the visit of the Lions in 2001, and winning 3-0. Australia had already lost a home test to Scotland, who also beat Fiji and Samoa in single tests. Scotland's visit to the Pacific islands was the first tour there by a tier 1 nation since 2006.\nIreland lost to the Barbarians, also a non-cap game, before touring New Zealand and being swept 3-0 in the series. This was Ireland and New Zealand's first ever three-test series, and the first longer tour hosted there since the Lions' visit in 2005.\nArgentina hosted France, drawing a two-test series 1-1, and Italy, who they defeated in a single test. Italy also played tests against the USA and Canada, winning both.\nThe new calendar also provided expanded opportunities for \"Tier 2\" nations. Georgia visited Canada and the USA, losing one-off test matches to both. After their Pacific Nations Cup games, Japan played two home matches against the French Barbarians, losing both.\nNotes:\n2013.\nNote:\n2015.\nBecause of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, no test series took place between the Home Unions (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) and the SANZAR nations (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia). However, England, Ireland, Uruguay, Argentina, and South Africa did opt to play uncapped matches to assist their World Cup preparations.\nSome Test matches were still played. Samoa hosted New Zealand in Apia, and Fiji hosted the Maori All Blacks in Suva. Kenya hosted test matches against Portugal and Spain. A two test-series was also played with Russia touring to Namibia.\n2019.\nBecause of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, no test series took place between the Home Unions (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) and the SANZAAR nations (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia and Argentina). However, Uruguay did opt to play a match to assist their World Cup preparation.\nSome Test matches were still played. Spain and Romania toured South America, both teams playing tests against Brazil and Chile with Spain playing an addition match against Uruguay."

        "text": "This is a recap of the 1991 season for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. It was the tour's 33rd season, and consisted of 36 events.\nThe 1991 season featured the infamous \"Del Ballard, Jr. gutter ball.\" Needing two strikes and seven pins in the tenth frame to defeat Pete Weber for the title at the Fair Lanes Open, Ballard got the necessary first two strikes. But he then inexplicably tossed his fill ball into the channel, handing Weber the title.\nBallard would rebound to win four titles in 1991, but it was another four-time winner, David Ozio, who claimed PBA Player of the Year honors. Among his four titles on the season, Ozio was victorious at the Firestone Tournament of Champions. The televised finals for this event were delayed 40 minutes due to a bomb threat, which turned out to be a prank call.\nMike Miller won his first-ever PBA title at the PBA National Championship, while Pete Weber captured the second BPAA U.S. Open title of his career, and fourth major title overall. Post-interview after winning the tournament, Pete held up the trophy above his head, and the cast resin eagle attachment unexpectedly fell from the base and shattered into pieces upon hitting the floor. Telecast commentator and longtime professional Nelson Burton, Jr. later suspected guilt for the mishap, recalling that before they went on the air, he unscrewed the nut that held the eagle in place and showed it to the audience before putting it back on the base, neglecting to secure the nut back on. He cannot remember fully if this is the case, but believes it is. Weber was mailed a replacement trophy a few days later.\nJohn Mazza made PBA TV history in a semi-final match at the Bud Light Classic, when he became just the second person ever to convert the 7–10 split on national television. (Mark Roth was the first.) Jess Stayrook would become the third player to accomplish the same feat, later in the season at the Tucson Open."

        "text": "The Gold Cup is the premier rugby union club competition in South Africa for non-university teams.\nThe competition was launched as the SARU Community Cup in 2013 to replace the existing SARU National Club Championships and renamed to the Gold Cup for 2016, when teams from Namibia and Zimbabwe were also included in the competition.\nHistory.\nOn 20 September 2012, the South African Rugby Union announced the launch of the SARU Community Cup to replace the National Club Championships. The inaugural edition started in February 2013. Several rugby union clubs in South Africa are affiliated to universities, which already competed in the annual Varsity Rugby tournaments. The Community Cup was created as a national competition for non-university clubs.\nAfter three seasons during which the matches were played over the Easter weekend, it was rebranded as the Gold Cup, moved to a timeslot later in the year and also included teams from Namibia and Zimbabwe.\nFormat.\nEach season, twenty teams qualify for the Gold Cup from the club leagues of the fourteen provincial unions in South Africa. In addition, the Blue Bulls Limpopo sub-union also entered a team every year and from 2016 onwards, the champions of the Namibian and Zimbabwean club competitions would also enter. The defending champions of the Gold Cup would automatically qualify to the next edition. Each of the provincial unions would nominate a team which would automatically qualify for the competition – it is dependent on the rules of the individual league whether this will be the team that finishes top of the log during the round-robin stage of the competition or the title play-off winner. All university teams are ineligible and would be excluded from participation.\nIn addition to the automatic qualifiers, the remainder of the participating teams would consist of wildcard entries. For 2013 and 2014, teams were nominated to enter a wildcard draw, but from 2015 onwards a play-off competition was introduced, where the second-best eligible teams from the provincial unions could play off for the remaining spots.\nThe format of the Gold Cup is the same as the Rugby World Cup. The teams are divided into four pools, each containing five teams. They then play four pool games, playing every other teams in their respective pools once. Each team plays two home games and two away games.\nThe winner and runner-up of each pool enter the play-off stage, held at a neutral venue over the Easter long weekend each year. The play-offs consist of quarter finals, semi-finals and the final. The winner of each pool meets the runner-up of a different pool in the quarter-final. The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals and the semi-final winners to the Cup final. The losing semi-finalists play each other in the 3rd-place play-off. The losing quarter finalists meet in the Plate semi-final, the winners of which will play in the Plate final, with the losers playing in the 7th-place play-off.\nSponsorship.\nIn February 2013, it was announced that mobile phone provider Cell C would sponsor the SARU Community Cup for three seasons, with the tournament being known as the Cell C Community Cup.\nTeams.\nThe teams that participated in the Gold Cup and their finishing positions are as follows:"

The team's head coach is Johnny Jones, who is in his first season at LSU. Jones previously served as the head coach at the University of North Texas. Jones played in the 1981 Final Four as a freshman at Louisiana State University, and later served 12 seasons as an assistant coach at LSU under Dale Brown where the pair returned the 1986 Final Four. They play their home games at Pete Maravich Assembly Center as members of the Southeastern Conference.\nPrevious season.\nThe Tigers completed the 2011–2012 season with an overall record of 18-15 and a 7–9 record in conference play. After falling to the eventual national champions, the Kentucky Wildcats, in the second round of the SEC tournament, LSU received a bid to the NIT tournament, where they were defeated by the Oregon Ducks in the first round. LSU lost several major contributors at the end of the season, including 2nd team All-SEC center Justin Hamilton, who was selected 45th overall in the 2012 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers.\nIn April 2012, it was announced that after four seasons as head coach, Trent Johnson would be leaving LSU to become the head basketball coach at TCU. Shortly after, LSU announced that it had hired Johnny Jones as its new head coach. Jones played at LSU for four seasons from 1980 to 1984, including an appearance in the 1981 NCAA Final Four. He followed his playing career by serving as an assistant coach under Dale Brown from 1984 to 1997.

It was held over an eleven-day period beginning on 16 August, and culminating with the medal finals on 26 August. All games were played at the hockey centre within the Hellinikon Olympic Complex in Athens, Greece.\nGermany won the gold medal for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final. Argentina won the bronze medal by defeating China 1–0.\nQualification.\nEach of the continental champions from five federations received an automatic berth. Along with the five teams qualifying through the Olympic Qualification Tournament, ten teams competed in this tournament.\nAlthough the host nation would have qualified automatically as well, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to give them an automatic berth due to the standard of hockey in Greece. Greece appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), however it was turned down. Greece's first option to gain a place at the Olympics was by qualifying for the EuroHockey Nations Championship held in 2003. As they did not qualify for this tournament their last option was to beat Russia, the last ranked team of the Olympic Qualification Tournament in a best of three play-off competition. Russia would have kept its place in the Qualifier regardless of whether it won or lost against Greece. There would, however, have been four places at stake at the tournament if Greece had qualified, rather than five. Eventually Greece withdrew from participating due to explicit financial reasons.\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nPool A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\nPool B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;"

        "text": "The Australian Junior Ice Hockey League (AJIHL) is an elite amateur national ice hockey league in Australia, open to players 20 years of age or younger.\nHistory.\nThe Australian Junior Ice Hockey League was first announced on 18 September 2012 by Ice Hockey Australia. The inaugural season consisted of four teams – Melbourne Blackhawks, Melbourne Red Wings, Sydney Lightning and the Sydney Maple Leafs, with teams being operated by their respective state governing body. The first season started on 20 October 2012 at the Medibank Icehouse in Melbourne and ran until March 2013 with the finals to be held on 9 and 10 March 2013.\nThe Sydney Maple Leafs won the inaugural AJIHL finals after beating the Melbourne Red Wings in a tie-breaking sudden overtime period after the teams leveled the two game series. The Maple Leafs had defeated the Sydney Lightning the week before in the Sydney semi-final, while the Red Wings won the Melbourne semi-final against the Blackhawks 7–3 to progress into the final.\nOn 22 August 2013 it was announced that Ice Hockey Victoria were renaming the two Melbourne teams for the 2013–14 season. The Melbourne Blackhawks were renamed as the Melbourne Whalers and the Melbourne Red Wings became the Melbourne Glaciers.\nThe following month the Sydney Maple Leafs were renamed the Sydney Wolf Pack and the Sydney Lightning changed their name to the Sydney Sabres. The changes were made in response to the National Hockey Leagues concern about the AJIHL using their team names and logos, as well as an opportunity to create new history for the teams.\nFirst Expansion.\nIn October 2013 the league expanded to six teams with two teams from Perth, the Sharks and the Pelicans, joining for the start of the 2013–14 season. It is expected that the AJIHL will further expand in 2015-16 to include 3 new teams from Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra.\nThe Sydney-based teams play their homes games at the Penrith Ice Palace in Penrith, New South Wales, the Melbourne-based teams play out of the O'Brien Group Arena in Docklands, Victoria. and the Perth-based teams play out of the Xtreme Ice Arena in Mirrabooka, Western Australia.\nSecond Expansion.\nAt the beginning of the 2015-16 AJIHL season, a proposal for the next expansion in the AJIHL was made by Ice Hockey Australia to include teams from the Australian states of Queensland and South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. A Wild Card entry was created in the AJIHL playoff structure, but no further public information would be made available for months despite plans to form junior teams in each of these states being underway.\nOn the 21 January 2016 a Tier 2 extension of the AJIHL was announced which would consist of a round robin style tournament and playoff to pick a wild card entry into the AJIHL finals. Currently 3 teams are in the AJIHL Tier 2 league, representing the Australian cities Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra.\nBy October 2016 no information about the 2016-17 AJIHL season had been released and it was not until the very end of the month that information began to surface over social media involving a weekend schedule involving only the Sydney-based teams and the new expansion teams from Canberra and Brisbane. It was later revealed that the league would adopt a new state based weekend mini tournament style format with 2 conferences in order to minimise the added expenditure involved in having 3 additional cities joining the League. In the first week of December Canberra Junior Brave withdrew from the scheduled weekend tournament, leaving the remaining 3 teams to only play 4 games instead of the scheduled 6 and the status of the Canberra Junior Brave unknown for the remainder of the season. On 17 December 2016, Brisbane Blitz goaltender Imogen Perry became the first female to play in the Australian Junior Ice Hockey League, facing 38 shots on goal against the Sydney Sabres and winning 7 - 1.\nOn 6 January 2017, the next schedule was released involving the remaining teams in Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. Due to a shrinking junior talent pool, the Melbourne Whalers suspended operations for the 2016-17 AJIHL season and only the Melbourne Glaciers would compete. No ice time was reserved to schedule AJIHL games in Melbourne. The Perth Pelicans also suspended operation for the 2016-17 AJIHL season, leaving only the Perth Sharks to compete.\nTeams.\nThere are currently 6 teams in the AJIHL, representing the Australian cities Perth, Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane.\nThere are currently 3 AJIHL teams that will be inactive since the 2016-17 AJIHL season."

        "text": "The 2012–13 Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball team represented the University of Mississippi in the 2012–13 college basketball season. The team's head coach was Andy Kennedy, in his seventh season at Ole Miss. The team played their home games at the Tad Smith Coliseum in Oxford, Mississippi as a member of the Southeastern Conference.\nAfter finishing the regular season with a record of 23–8 (12–6 SEC), the Rebels claimed the 2013 SEC tournament championship by defeating Florida in the title game. They earned an automatic berth into the 2013 NCAA tournament as a #12 seed in the west region, where they advanced to the third round before falling to La Salle.\nPreseason.\nThe Rebels posted a record of 20–14 (8-8 SEC) in the 2011–12 season and finished seventh in the SEC standings. The Rebels were invited to the 2012 NIT and lost in the first round to Illinois State.\nEntering his seventh year as the Rebels’ head coach, Kennedy's 108 wins are the most by any coach in program history in a five-year span, and the Rebels’ 38 victories over Southeastern Conference foes are the most by a Rebel coach in his first five seasons. The 2012–13 Rebel squad will look to build on three straight seasons with 20 or more wins and a postseason berth.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12| Exhibition\n!colspan=12| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12| SEC Regular Season\n!colspan=12| SEC tournament\n!colspan=12|NCAA tournament"

        "text": "ICF Canoe Marathon World Championships is an International Canoe Federation competition in canoe marathon in which athletes compete over long distances. The race usually starts and ends at the same place, and includes portages. Race categories vary by the number of athletes in the boat, the length of the course, and whether the boat is a canoe or kayak. In a kayak, the paddler is seated in the direction of travel, and uses a double-bladed paddle. In a canoe the paddler kneels on one knee with the other leg forward and foot flat on the floor inside the boat, and paddles a single-bladed paddle on one side only. The World Championships were held every two years from 1988, becoming annual in 1998.\nMedalists.\nThe following tables give the results."

        "title": "Royal Johannesburg &amp; Kensington Golf Club",
        "text": "The Royal Johannesburg &amp; Kensington Golf Club is a 36-hole golf complex located in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.\nThe resort opened in 1890 as the Royal Johannesburg Golf Club, and merged with the Kensington Golf Club in 1998. It is part of the PGA Tour network of golf courses. The East Course has hosted the South African PGA Championship since 2005 and both the East and West, the Joburg Open since 2007, the biggest annual professional golf event in Africa; the 2012 field was the largest of the PGA European Tour season, with 210 players. It also has hosted the International Final Qualifier (Africa) for the Open Championship since 2009, the Sanlam Women's Amateur Golf Championships of South Africa in 2008, and the 5 Nations Commonwealth Tournament in 2007.\nHistory.\nFounded on 6 November 1890, members of the Johannesburg Golf Club first began playing \"behind Hospital Hill\", in an area that later became known as Clarendon Circle and Empire Road. The club did not settle here, moving four times in the next 19 years, before settling in 1909 on the land it still occupies today.\nThe Club helped create the Transvaal Golf Union in 1908, and provided the first President of the South African Golf Union in 1910.\nIn 1930, the Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VIII), played the West Course. Six months later, he became the club's patron. In July 1931, King George V added the \"Royal\" prefix to the club's name.\nLittle is known about the original Kensington Golf Club that went out of business in 1918. The later version of Kensington hosted a number of significant South African tournaments and competitions, particularly in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Kensington merged with Royal Johannesburg in 1998.\nWest Course.\nThe West Course was designed in 1909 by Laurie Waters. In 1929, British architect Major Hotchkin made considerable changes to the course, with construction being carried out by club professional Robert Grimsdell.\nThe 4th hole is regarded as the signature hole. A tributary of the Jukskei River sits at the front the green and is in play along the left hand side of the fairway. The hole is set against the scenic backdrop of Linksfield Ridge.\nEast Course.\nIn 1933, the club owners decided to build a second course, which resulted in the purchase of a farm to the east of the club. Grimsdell began designing the new course. Within two years, Grimsdell had constructed 21 new holes, and both the East and West courses were in play. Grimsdell then began construction on a new clubhouse, placed centrally between the two courses. Construction was completed in March 1939. Golf course architect Mark Muller revamped the original construction in 1998.\nThe 10th and 11th holes are reputed to be the two longest back-to-back par fours in the world. The South African PGA Championship, Joburg Open, and International Final Qualifier (Africa) for the Open Championship all play on this course.\nHoles and Yardages.\n\"Out: 3,543 yards – par 37\"\n\"In: 3,397 yards- par 35\"\n\"Total: 6,940 yards- par 72\"\nAwards.\nThe Royal became the first Audubon-certified golf course in South Africa, as it became a \"Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary\" in 2005. The club also was the first member-owned club in South Africa to receive the Compleat Golfer 5 Star Golfing Experience Award, and has earned that same award three additional times since then.\nIn 2018 The East Championship Course received Africa's best course of the year and South Africa's best Course of the year by World Golf Awards."

It was held over a thirteen-day period beginning on 15 August, and culminating with the medal finals on 27 August. All games were played at the hockey centre within the Hellinikon Olympic Complex in Athens, Greece.\nAustralia won the gold medal for the first time after defeating defending champions the Netherlands 2–1 in the final. Germany won the bronze medal by defeating Spain 4–3.\nQualification.\nEach of the continental champions from five federations received an automatic berth. Alongside the seven teams qualifying through the 2004 Men's Field Hockey Olympic Qualification Tournament, twelve teams competed in this tournament.\nAlthough the host nation would have qualified automatically as well, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to give them an automatic berth due to the standard of hockey in Greece. Greece appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), however it was turned down. Greece's first option to gain a place at the Olympics was by qualifying for the EuroHockey Nations Championship held in 2003. As they did not qualify for this tournament their last option was to beat Canada, the last ranked team of the Olympic Qualification Tournament in a best of three play-off competition. Canada would have kept its place in the Qualifier regardless of whether it won or lost against Greece. There would, however, have been six places at stake at the tournament if Greece had qualified, rather than the seven eventually available. Greece lost the first two matches against Canada, losing their chance to qualify to the Olympics.\nPreliminary round.\nPool A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\nPool B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;"

In the last three years, he upgraded from an average of 27 points per game to 29 points per game in the 2007–08, with shooting averages of 50% in field goals, 54.5% in three-pointers, and 85.7% from free-throws. In his final year at West Virginia, he suffered an ACL knee injury with two games played, but still averaged 23.4 points per game, with shooting averages of 50.3% from field goals, 34.6% in three-pointers and 82.8% from the free throw line.\nScott never shot less than 81.5% from the free throw line over the five years, with 2005-06, being the best with 85.9%. He finished his college career in Virginia State, with a second place in both, points over the career (2368) and over a season (892 in 2006-07), plus sixth place in scoring average (19.7).\nProfessional career.\nAfter not being drafted, Scott moved to Europe and had brief experiences at Sportino Inowrocław in the Polish Basketball League, with an average of 20 points per game, on just 10 games, before moved again, joining BC Ferro-ZNTU on the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague. He returned to Poland in the following season, making an immediate impact, averaging 25.4 points per game and leading the league in the scoring charts.\nScott then made a move to the Portuguese Basketball League to join Benfica, being an important part in the league title campaign, averaging 16.97 points per game in the regular season, and increasing to 18.72 in the playoffs, being instrumental on the game 5 of the final against Porto, on 23 May 2012.\nFollowing the performances in Portugal, he moved to the more competitive BBL in the summer of 2013, to play for the Skyliners Frankfurt under coach Muli Katzurin. He averaged 13.5 points per game in 12 games, but as the Skyliners were nearing the bottom of the table, management opted to release Scott. He finished the season at LEB Oro team, Club Melilla Baloncesto, signing on 16 February 2013, and averaging 14.8 points per game in 8 games, as the team finished dead last in 2012–13 LEB Oro season."

        "text": "The Women's time trial of the 2012 UCI Road World Championships cycling event took place on 18 September 2012 in and around Valkenburg, Netherlands.\nJudith Arndt of Germany defended successfully her world time trial title. The 36-year-old, who retired at the end of the championships, completed the hilly course in a time of 32 minutes 26 seconds to beat former teammate Evelyn Stevens of the United States by 33 seconds. Stevens had been the seventh last to start, and her time of 33 minutes dead took the lead from teammate Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands. Second last to go, as the previous year's silver medallist, New Zealand's Linda Villumsen, Arndt's Orica–AIS teammate, came closest to unseating the American, but crossed the line in 33’07\", which was only good enough for provisional second place, ahead of 2010 champion Emma Pooley of Great Britain. As defending champion Arndt set off last and, after setting the fastest time at both intermediate checkpoints, powered up the final Cauberg climb and sprinted to the finish to push Stevens off the top step of the podium, and Pooley out of the medals altogether."

        "text": "Drummoyne Rowing Club, formed in 1919 in Sydney, Australia is one of four rowing clubs on Iron Cove in Sydney Harbour. It has occupied its current site at Sister's Bay, Drummoyne since its foundation. The DRC is a community based competitive and recreational rowing club with a long history in welcoming women members. It offers programs at club and master's level and leases its facilities for some schools' programs.\nHistory.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported on 7 March 1896 that a committee was appointed to form Drummoyne Rowing Club. Nothing progressed until 20 January 1919 when again a meeting was held on forming a club.\nThe minutes recorded: \"A meeting of a number of prominent rowing men of the district was held on Monday last for the purpose of forming a rowing club at Drummoyne. It was decided to petition the Mayor with a view to his calling a public meeting in the local Town Hall on 3 February, when a scheme drawn up by the meeting will be discussed. The sum of £50 has already been given\". The following officers were elected :- Hon. Secretary, Mr. F. Cronin; Assistant Hon. Secretary, Mr. N. Barrell; Honorary Treasurer Mr. J. Huston.\nMr. Fred Cronin, one of the hon. secretaries of the proposed new rowing club at Drummoyne, advised that the public meeting which was to have been held at the Drummoyne Town Hall on Monday 14 July had been postponed for about a\nmonth. It was not thought advisable to hold it on the original date owing to the influenza epidemic in Sydney.\nLater, A.C Ingham, a Drummoyne Alderman and Quarton Deloitte Sydney Rowing Club President and Mr W.A Hence of the NSW Rowing Association presided over a public meeting at the Drummoyne Town Hall on 28 August 1919 which was called for the purpose of forming a rowing club at Drummoyne. The Enterprise Rowing Club on the other side of the Iron Cove at Balmain had been destroyed by a fierce gale on 19 September 1917. A number of Enterprise Club members were Drummoyne residents and there was an interest in rebuilding across the river. Fred Cronin, Wally Kolts, Bill Witt Senior and Junior, George McKenzie, Lance Wearne &amp; Norm Barrell were the Enterprise members instrumental in the DRC's foundation. The first committee was elected on 1 September 1919 with Ingham as President and Cronin as Secretary. The club chose to welcome women members from its inception.\nBy 29 November 1919, three concrete piers, forming part of the foundation of the boat house, were placed in position in Sister's Bay on the Iron Cove. The building took two years to complete, work being done on Saturday afternoons and holidays only. The new boathouse was officially opened by Sir Walter Davidson on 24 September 1921. Mr A.C. Ingham owned a timber yard and supplied materials at cost as well as standing as guarantor for the club to its bank lender. The club's first boat purchase around that same time was a four-oared boat from George Towns &amp; Sons. Much of the building work was done by volunteers and the clubhouse was finally completed in September 1921 and opened by the Governor Sir Walter Davidson.\nThe club won the Junior Pennant in its first two years of existence and was runner-up in both pennants in its third year, all this notwithstanding the fact that the fleet consisted only of one racing eight and one regulation four. In March 1923, the NSW State Eight crew prepared for the Interstate Rowing Championships at the new boatshed.\nIn 1966 a liquor license was obtained by which stage membership numbers had grown to 205 and a new licensed clubhouse was opened in 1968 with dining room extensions completed by 1975. A new boathouse was rebuilt in the mid 1980s. The licensed club ran into financial difficulties in the new millennium and ceased operation from 2010, although rowing continued.\nThe rowing club and its members continue to compete in club, state and national regattas.\nRegattas.\nThe Drummoyne Regatta course on Iron Cove is a 1000m sprint course that starts off Leichhardt Park near the Leichhardt Rowing Club and finishes in Sister's Bay off the DRC boatshed. As of 2018 Drummoyne host a Rowers Regatta (consisting of around 40 events) in March of the Rowing NSW season and a Masters Regatta a month later consisting of around 50 masters events. Along with the Glebe Rowing Club and the three other Iron Cove rowing clubs Drummoyne host one of the four week JB Sharp winter regattas over a short form 900m course.\nMembers.\nNotable past members include:"

The sailing classes had two changes from the 2012 Summer Olympics events. There were 10 events.\nOverview.\nCompetition incidents.\nFollowing the announcement of the games, water pollution became a hot topic, and a commitment to cleaning up the water was given by the hosts. This target was not fully achieved and water quality issues were frequently in the media. World Sailing examined various options including holding the racing fully outside the bay or even moving the event to Buzios. However, in the end only the Belgian sailor Evi Van Acker reported that her Olympics were affected. The German sailor Erik Heil was also infected by multi-resistant germs during an Olympic test event in Rio. The location for sailing events was a source of concern for athletes since scientists had found drug-resistant super bacteria in Guanabara Bay due to the daily dumping of hospital waste and household raw sewage into the rivers and ocean. The Brazilian federal government's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation lab also found the genes of super bacteria in a river that empties into Guanabara Bay.\nJust before the games the launch ramp collapsed but no one was injured.\nCompetition format.\nQualification.\nA total of 380 athletes competed in the sailing competitions of the Games. The qualification period began at the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships in September 2014. As hosts, Brazil was guaranteed one quota place in each of the ten events.\nScoring.\nRacing at the 2016 Olympics was fleet racing where all competitors started and sailed the course together. They were scored according to the low-point system, where first place is scored 1, second place is scored 2, etc. There was a series of preliminary races followed by the final Medal Race. The RS:X, 49er, 49erFX, and Nacra 17 classes had 12 preliminary races, other classes have 10.\nAt the end of the preliminary races, the top ten boats in each class (i.e. those with the lowest total scores) advanced to the Medal Race. Each boat might exclude one race from their total. The Medal Race could not be excluded from the series score and counts double. The boat with the lowest overall total after all races was the winner. Any ties in the final rankings were broken in favour of the competitor/crew finishing higher in the Medal Race.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe competition started on 8 August and finished on 18 August. \nMedal summary.\nMedal table.\n Host nation (Brazil)"

        "text": "Golf at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was held in August at the new Olympic Golf Course (), built within the Reserva de Marapendi in the Barra da Tijuca zone.\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics was the first time golf had been played at the Olympics since the 1904 Summer Olympics and featured two events: the men's and women's individual events.\nChanges.\nThough golf had not featured in the Olympics since the 1904 Summer Olympics, the session of the 121st IOC Session held in 2009 chose to re-introduce the sport for the games. With the rapid expansion and globalisation of the sport, the 121st International Olympic Committee recommended adding golf back into the Summer Olympics.\nTy Votaw, who was the Executive Vice President of Communications and International Affairs and Vice President of the International Golf Federation, along with Peter Dawson, who was the president of the IGF and chief executive of The R&amp;A, were at the forefront of making golf an Olympic sport once again.\nBefore the vote to reinstate golf into the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games, a presentation by a group of golf ambassadors helped sway the 121st session of the International Olympic Committee. These ambassadors included Dawson and Votaw, along with four pro golfers: three-time major champion Pádraig Harrington of Ireland, Michelle Wie of the United States, Women's PGA Champion Suzann Pettersen of Norway and 16-year-old 2009 British Amateur champion Matteo Manassero of Italy. On 9 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee had their final vote and the vote passed, which officially made golf an Olympic sport for the 2016 and 2020 Summer games.\nFormat.\nThe 120 (60 men and women) competitors played two separate (one for men, one for women) 72-hole (i.e. 4 rounds of 18 holes) individual stroke play tournaments under the official rules of golf. In the event of a tie for any of the first three positions, a three-hole playoff would have determined the medal winners.\nLocation.\nThe new Olympic golf course was built at the Reserva de Marapendi in the Barra da Tijuca zone. Hanse Golf Course Design was chosen from eight contenders to build the course. Founder and President Gil Hanse reacted to the news in saying: \"I'm excited that the selection panel felt that our efforts were the ones that best matched the criteria set by organisers.\" They have signed up with World Golf Hall of Famer Amy Alcott to work on the project.\nThe president of the Rio 2016 Organising Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Carlos Arthur Nuzman, said: \"As [the 2016 Games] marks the return of golf to the Olympic Games after over a century of absence, this course represents the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the sport. It will enable Rio to host important events in the international calendar, and it would be an example of sustainability and preservation of an environmentally protected area. This course will be an excellent facility for the practice and development of golf and will inspire millions of youth across Brazil and the globe. We look forward to welcoming the athletes and spectators to the course in 2016.\"\nAfter the games, the course would become a public facility and would be used to enhance golf's profile within Brazil; according to the organising committee, this would represent \"one of the most important Olympic Games legacies for sport development in the country.\"\nThe Olympic Committee said that one of their goals for the Olympics was to create an environmentally sustainable Games. In building the golf course, the grass selection was critical for sustainability and water use. The quality of the water as an irrigation source for the course was in question, so the grasses selected had to be salt-tolerant. The grass sprigged on the greens of the course was SeaDwarf Seashore Paspalum, a highly salt-tolerant grass variety. The grass planted on the tees and fairways is Zeon Zoysia, developed by Bladerunner Farms in Poteet, Texas. Zeon Zoysia is a warm-season turfgrass that requires little fertilizer and minimal maintenance. Both kinds of grass were grown on a sod farm in Brazil at Green Grass Brasil. The sod farm was a licensed producer of both grass varieties.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe men's competition was scheduled for 11–14 August and the women's for 17–20 August.\nQualification.\nQualification was based on world ranking as of 11 July 2016, with a total of 60 players qualifying in each of the men's and women's events. The top 15 players of each gender will qualify, with a limit of four golfers per country that can qualify this way. The remaining spots will go the highest-ranked players from countries that do not already have two golfers qualified. The IGF has guaranteed that at least one golfer from the host nation and each geographical region (Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) will qualify. The IGF posts weekly lists of qualifiers based on current rankings for men and women.\nA number of golfers withdrew, for reasons including the Zika virus epidemic and their schedules, while others were not selected by their national Olympic committee. Top male golfers withdrew in larger numbers than top female golfers. Missing eligible golfers, with their rankings at the qualification date, were:\nBoth male and female golfers cited the Zika virus as cause to withdraw from the Games. The virus can live longer in semen than in blood and might thus infect a male golfer's partner for up to six months later or even more, and therefore also cause birth defects this way. Other reasons for the withdrawals have been suggested.\nParticipating nations.\nEach country qualified from one to seven athletes based on World Rankings."

The 2016 Olympics was the debut for rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics, though rugby union was last played at the 1924 games.\nThe usual laws of rugby sevens applied.\nChanges.\nThough rugby has not been featured in the Olympics since the 1924 Summer Olympics in any form, the IOC chose to re-introduce the seven-a-side version of the sport for the games. The sport featured for the 2016 and the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nVenue.\nThe rugby competition took place in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium. The original plan was to stage the rugby matches at the São Januário Stadium. However this was scrapped because the club in charge of the venue missed the deadline to present its project. The Organising Committee considered Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which would have had to have been shared with the athletics competitions. It was later announced that the rugby competition will take place in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium, shared with the modern pentathlon. In April 2016 concerns were raised by the World Rugby head of competitions and performance, Mark Egan, about progress of construction at the temporary 15,000-seater stadium.\nQualification.\nBrazil men’s and women’s teams automatically qualified for the events. Qualification began with the 2014–15 Sevens World Series (men's) and 2014–15 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, where the 4 teams at the top of the standings qualified for the 2016 Olympic Games. In June–September 2015, each of the six regional rugby unions held an Olympic qualification event, where one team from each region qualified. The final spot will be determined by a repechage tournament. It will comprise 16 teams from the regional qualifiers: 4 from Europe, 3 from Africa, 3 from Asia, 2 from Oceania, 2 from North America and 2 from South America.\nAs a result of Great Britain competing as one union in the Olympics and as several in international rugby (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Irish players that choose to play for the Irish Rugby Union), should one of either the England, Wales or Scotland teams qualify then Great Britain will be awarded a spot in the Olympic Games. These three British unions agreed in advance of the 2013–14 men's and women's Sevens World Series that their highest-finishing teams in that season would represent all three unions in the first stage of qualification in both 2014–15 series. The England men's and women's teams earned the right to represent the British unions in that stage of their respective competitions. The unions will then decide the composition of the Great Britain team. Players based in Northern Ireland are part of the Irish Rugby Football Union and the IRFU demanded that Northern Irish players, that have committed to play for the Irish rugby union, only play for Ireland despite being eligible under IOC rules to compete for Great Britain.\nThe world governing body for the sport renamed itself from the International Rugby Board to World Rugby (WR) effective 19 November 2014.\nWomen's tournament.\n1. South Africa won the continental qualifier, but did not participate in the 2016 Olympics. The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee's qualification criteria do not permit qualification via the continental route. Kenya, as the second-placed team in the African qualifiers, advanced to the Olympics.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe competition will run August 6–11.\nIn the Men's tournament, pool A consists of Fiji, Argentina, USA and Brazil. Pool B includes South Africa, Australia, France and Spain while pool C consists of New Zealand, Great Britain, Kenya and Japan.\nIn the Women's tournament pool A consists of Australia, USA, Fiji and Colombia. Pool B includes New Zealand, France, Spain and Kenya while pool C consists of Canada, Great Britain, Brazil and Japan.\nTeam issues.\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThe international structure of rugby union with respect to Great Britain and Northern Ireland is similar to that of association football, but with its own unique features. In football, the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) all field separate national teams, which led to a controversy over how to field a combined Great Britain football team at the 2012 Olympics. The Republic of Ireland fields its own national team in football. In rugby union, the three Home Nations that share the island of Great Britain also have their own national teams. Ireland, by contrast, is not divided for rugby purposes—the sport is organised on an All-Ireland basis, with a single governing body for the entire island. Great Britain will get a chance to field a combined team.\nThis structure led to some minor issues regarding participation of a Great Britain team in the qualifying stages of the 2016 Games. Due to a tradition of cooperation between the governing bodies of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland—especially during the quadrennial tours of the Southern Hemisphere by the unified British and Irish Lions 15-a-side team—these were far less contentious than in football; as early as 2011, World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Board) endorsed the concept of a united Great Britain team for the 2016 Games.\nIn August 2012, a provisional plan was announced by which England, Scotland and Wales would all be able to qualify as a Great Britain sevens team for the 2016 Games. The first qualifying stage is planned to be the 2014–2015 men's Sevens World Series and World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, with the top four teams of each sex at the end of that season advancing to the Games. All three nations are \"core teams\" that participate in every event of the men's Sevens Series; the Women's Sevens Series began in 2012–2013 with England as one of the six core teams. Qualifying will continue with regional tournaments and a final worldwide Olympic qualifier. Should any of the three teams finish in a qualifying spot at any stage, Great Britain will send a team to the Games. The final composition of a Great Britain team would then be determined by the three nations and the British Olympic Association.\nAs is the case with olympic boxing, rugby in Ireland is organised on an all-island basis. This means that Northern Irish players who have chosen to represent Ireland in rugby, despite the fact that they are residents of the UK, must play for the IRFU and thus must compete for Ireland. Northern Irish players who have qualified to play international rugby for the other home nations could still play for Great Britain.\nBrazil.\nAnother issue was to make Brazil's automatically qualifying team competitive. In an attempt to address this for the women's tournament, the IRB announced in August 2013 that Brazil would be an invited core team in the Women's Sevens World Series for at least the 2013–14 season."

He played at representative level for New Zealand (Heritage № 48), and Nelson, as a forward (prior to the specialist positions of ), during the era of contested scrums.\nPlaying career.\nRugby union career.\nHannigan played rugby union, for the Nelson-Marlborough combined side against the 1908 Anglo-Wesh touring side. Following his rugby league career Hannigan moved back to rugby. He was a member of the Pikomanu club in the 1920s before transferring back to his old Rival club in 1926. He was still playing in 1930 for Rival and in a match against the Nelson club a spectator remarked \"What! is that Pat Hannigan? I played with him 22 years ago\". He was still playing in September 1932 when the Nelson Evening Mail reported that \"Pat Hannigan, who, though approaching the half century mark, still keeps up with the game in a remarkable manner\" after their match with Pirates.\nRugby league career.\nIn 1910 Hannigan joined the Alhambra club in Nelson. He played 10 matches for them during the season all against the Kaitoa club. In July he was nominated for selection in the New Zealand team along with fellow Nelson player Charles James. He played as a forward, i.e. number 9, in the 20-52 defeat by Great Britain at Domain Cricket Ground, Auckland on Saturday 30 July 1910. Following the test he played in 2 Nelson trial team sides before being selected for the Nelson team to play against Auckland on October 10. The match was played at Trafalgar Park in Nelson and was won by Auckland 24-13.\nIn 1911 he joined the newly formed St Mary's Catholic Club. He played 8 matches for them against Albion (previously known as Kaitoa). Hannigan played in a Nelson trial match in May and in August he was selected for the 'Northern Tour'. Nelson played 3 matches against Auckland at Victoria Park where they lost 36-12, Taranaki in Eltham, where he scored a try in a 16–8 loss, and Wanganui at Cooks Gardens where they were trounced 40-0.\nIn 1912 he continued to play for St Mary's. He also played for Nelson against Wanganui and then against Wellington at St Patricks College in Wellington. His only other representative match was for Nelson against Golden Bay on July 27. In 1913 he was named as an emergency player for Nelson in their July 26 match against Golden Bay. There is no further mention of him playing rugby league in the Nelson area after this as the game largely ceased in the area due to the outbreak of World War I.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1908 he married Mary Ellen Finnigan. They had one daughter, Joan Hannigan on January 20, 1917. Mary died in 1958 while daughter Joan died in 2000.\nPat died on April 14, 1964, and was buried at Karori, Wellington."

Six Dutch teams and one Belgian team took part in the season.\nWhen the Leuven Chiefs withdrew from the North Sea Cup at the end of the 2011–2012 season, only one Belgian team, HYC Herentals, remained in the mixed Dutch/Belgian tournament. It was decided to dispense with the North Sea Cup, reinstate the Dutch Eredivisie regular season, and admit HYC Herentals to the Eredivisie. Thus in 2012–2013, Herentals was the sole Belgian team to compete for the Dutch national championship (although Herentals still competed for the Belgian Cup).\nAlso new for the 2012–2013 season was the change of name of the Amsterdam team from \"Amsterdam Capitals\" the \"Amsterdam G's\" after finding a title sponsor.\nThe traditional first game (known as the \"Ron Berteling Bowl\"), was played on September 30 between the winner of the Dutch Cup and the winner of the Dutch championship from the previous year. The 7-team, 36-game regular season was followed by a playoff of the top 4 teams (a best-of five semi-final and a best-of-five final). HYS The Hague was both the top team in the regular season and the Dutch national champions after sweeping both rounds of the playoffs."

He played at representative level for New Zealand (Heritage No. 58), and Southland, and at club level for Ponsonby, as a forward (prior to the specialist positions of; ), during the era of contested scrums.\nRugby football career.\nMilne originally played rugby union, playing for the Britannia club in Southland in 1906. He played 8 matches for them in that season and made 5 appearances for Southland against Otago (twice), Wellington, Auckland, and Canterbury. In 1907 he moved to Otago and played for Taieri Rovers. It was rumoured that he could have gained selection for the Otago side but he moved to the North Island before the end of the season. He moved in the Wanganui country area and played for Hunterville and made 10 appearances for Wanganui in 1908 and 1909 including against the touring Anglo-Welsh side. He gained selection for the North Island team and played against the South Island on August 25, 1909.\nHe switched codes to rugby league in 1911 and represented New Zealand on the 1911 tour of Australia.\nIn 1936 in an article in the Manawatu Standard it was said that Milne moved to Sydney and played rugby league there \"for some years\" however this may have been 1912 and possibly later in the decade as he played rugby league for Opunake and the Taranaki representative side in 1913. He then played for Ponsonby United in their 1919 championship winning side. He then moved back down to the Taranaki region and played rugby for Rahotu-Okato in 1921, and Ōpunake in 1922. He was farming in the King Country area at the time of the 1936 article."

        "text": "The Legends Classic is an annual, early-season, college basketball tournament which started in 2007 and takes place at the beginning of the college basketball season in November. Four teams (from four conferences) compete in the Legends Classic. The tournament has been held at various venues in the New York metropolitan area, primarily the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\nHistory.\nThe Legends Classic began in 2007 with the first two events being played at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ. In that first year, only the four regional-round hosts were guaranteed to play four games, as Texas, Tennessee, West Virginia, and New Mexico State each hosted a pair of games, before advancing to the semifinals in Newark. Since the 2008–09 season, each team has been guaranteed to play four games.\nIn 2013, the field for the event decreased from 12 teams to 8 teams from eight separate conferences. Two games were held at four different regional sites selected before the tournament. Four teams advanced to the semifinals and finals at Barclays Center in New York City, while the remaining four teams played in a tournament format at a predetermined on-campus site. After a showcase format was used in 2020, following the withdrawal of teams due to COVID-19-related issues, the size of the field was reduced to four, starting in 2021, with all games played at the same venue.\nBrackets.\n2023.\nThe 2023 tournament took place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Texas and UCLA were originally set to play, but were replaced by Georgia and Providence.\n2020.\nThe field for the tournament for the year 2020 initially included four teams instead of the usual eight due to COVID-19 concerns. BYU replaced Notre Dame after they pulled out of the field. Then later Vanderbilt withdrew from the tournament as well and the format for the competition was changed to a showcase format. The location of the tournament was also relocated to the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut. The participants in the 2020 group included: \nAll games in the 2020 Tournament are televised on either ESPN or ESPN2. Due to Notre Dame and Vanderbilt not participating in the tournament, the format was changed to a showcase format with the following results.\nMVP: Evan Mobley (USC)\nAll-Tournament Team: Julian Champagnie (St. John's), Alex Barcello (BYU), James Bouknight (UConn) and Keyontae Johnson (Florida)."

        "title": "Brian Banks (American football)",
        "text": "Brian Keith Banks (born July 24, 1985) is a former American football player. He signed with the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL) on April 3, 2013. Banks signed as an undrafted free agent with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League (UFL) in 2012.\nBanks was a standout high school football star at Polytechnic High School (Poly) in Long Beach, California. In 2002, his Junior year, Banks verbally committed to USC. After being falsely accused of rape by classmate Wanetta Gibson, he spent close to six years imprisoned and five years on parole. In 2012, his conviction was overturned when his accuser confessed that she had fabricated the entire story. Following his exoneration, Banks sought to resume his football career, playing for the now-defunct United Football League (UFL), attending mini-camps for several NFL teams, and later signing with the Atlanta Falcons.\nHigh school career.\nA native of Long Beach, California, Banks attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where he was teammates with DeSean Jackson, Darnell Bing, Winston Justice, and Marcedes Lewis. He was named one of Rivals.com's \"Juniors to Watch\" of the class of 2003. He was expelled from school due to a rape accusation that was later proven to be false.\nProfessional career.\nIn the summer of 2012, Banks received tryouts with several NFL teams, including the Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers, and San Francisco 49ers. He attended minicamp with the Seattle Seahawks, whose head coach, Pete Carroll, had offered Banks a scholarship in 2002 when he was head coach at USC.\nLas Vegas Locomotives.\nBanks signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the UFL on September 20, 2012, appearing in two games–his first meaningful game action since playing in his last high school game more than 11 years earlier. He made one tackle before the UFL suspended its season in October.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nBanks signed with the Atlanta Falcons on April 3, 2013, participating in offseason workouts, OTAs, and training camp. Banks made his NFL debut in a preseason game against the Cincinnati Bengals, where he picked up two tackles. He played four preseason games with the Falcons before being released on August 30, 2013.\nNational Football League (NFL).\nIn 2014, Banks was asked by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to speak at the 2014 NFL draft Rookie Symposium. Banks accepted and his speech was well received. A few weeks later, he was hired to join the NFL Department of Operations.\nPersonal life.\nIn May 2015, Banks married Emmy Marino. They had no children and filed for divorce in February 2017.\nFalse accusation of sexual assault.\nIn the summer of 2002, aged 16, Banks was arrested and charged after classmate Wanetta Gibson falsely accused him of dragging her into a stairway and raping her. He was expelled from Long Beach Polytechnic High School shortly after being taken into custody and placed at Juvenile Hall. Shawn Ashley, who was a co-principal of Long Beach Poly High, had claimed that Banks would not be allowed back on campus regardless of any jurisdictional outcome. Faced with a possible 41 years to life sentence, he accepted a plea bargain that included five years in prison, five years of probation, and registering as a sex offender. Banks stated that his lawyer had said that by pleading no contest he would receive probation, but no jail time. \nGibson and her mother Wanda Rhodes sued the Long Beach Unified School District, claiming the Poly campus was not a safe environment, and won a $1.5 million settlement. \nConfession of false accusation.\nIn March 2011, Gibson contacted Banks on Facebook, met with him, and admitted in the presence of a private investigator Banks had hired that she had fabricated the story. Banks secretly recorded Gibson's confession, but she later (according to Banks and his private investigator) refused to tell prosecutors that she had lied so that she wouldn't have to return the money she and her family had won in court. It was unclear as to why she made the initial false accusation.\nCalifornia Innocence Project.\nPrior to the taped confession, Banks had asked for help from the California Innocence Project (CIP), a nonprofit law school clinic run by the San Diego-based California Western School of Law that investigates and litigates cases of actual innocence. At that time, however, there had not been sufficient evidence of Banks's innocence for them to take on the case. However, after the confession, CIP decided to make it the organization's first case involving a wrongfully convicted person who had already been released from prison.\nThe video evidence was not admissible in court because the video had been made without Gibson's knowledge or consent and was not accompanied by a signed confession from her. However, CIP was instrumental in putting together additional evidence supporting Banks' story, which led the district attorney to ask the judge to reverse the conviction on May 24, 2012. Banks was also relieved of his record as a sex offender, allowing him to resume his sports career.\nBanks supports CIP in its efforts on behalf of the wrongly convicted, participating in CIP's 2013 Innocence March.\nSchool lawsuit.\nIn 2013, the Long Beach Unified School District won a $2.6 million judgment against Gibson, recouping $750,000 in payments paid to her along with attorney's fees, interest, and $1 million in punitive damages; Gibson failed to appear in court.\nFilm adaptation.\nA feature film project based on Banks' story, co-executive produced by Banks and Justin Brooks of CIP, premiered in 2018 and was released in August 2019. It is directed by Tom Shadyac and features Aldis Hodge as Banks, Greg Kinnear as Brooks and Tiffany Dupont as CIP attorney Alissa Bjerkhoel."

However, because the team was organised by the Queensland Rugby League, it is not considered an official Australian match.\nThe players were scheduled to sail immediately after their final game as the New Zealand Rugby League had organised a match in Wellington.

        "text": "The men's eight competition at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich took place from 27 August to 2 September at the Olympic Reggatta Course in Oberschleißheim. There were 15 boats (135 competitors) from 15 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by New Zealand, the nation's first medal in the men's eight. Silver went to the United States. East Germany also earned its first medal in the event, with bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nAn event that for decades had been almost entirely predictable had a competitive field in 1972. The United States had won this event at eight of the last ten Olympics, but only one of the last three (1964). West Germany was the defending Olympic champion (and, as part of the United Team of Germany, had won in 1960 as well). Argentina had won the 1971 Pan American Games. East Germany were the 1969 European Rowing Championships winners, 1970 World Rowing Championships winners, and 1971 European Rowing Championships runners-up. The Soviet Union had reached the podium at the 1969 European, 1970 World, and 1971 European events. New Zealand's eight had, in identical composition, won the 1971 European Rowing Championships.\nAustria made its debut in the event. The United States made its 14th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). This rowing competition consisted of three main rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals; up from two main rounds in prior Games), as well as a repechage round after the quarterfinals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top three of each heat qualified to the semifinal round, while the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe top three finishers advanced to the semifinal round and the other teams were eliminated.\nSemifinals.\nThe top three finishers qualified for Final A, with the remainder going to Final B."

        "text": "Arthur Butler (1884–1947) was a pioneer Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s and 1910s. An Australian international and New South Wales interstate representative half, he played club football for the South Sydney, Glebe and Annandale clubs in the NSWRFL Premiership.\nPlaying career.\nButler played for Souths in the first season of rugby league in Australia, the 1908 NSWRFL season. He was also selected to play for New South Wales at halfback in their first ever rugby league game against Queensland, scoring a try in the 43–0 victory, which was the first in a clean sweep of all three of the 1908 interstate series' games.\nButler missed his club Souths' grand final victory as he was selected to go on the first Kangaroo tour, the 1908–09 tour of Great Britain.\nIn London, Australia faced the English in rugby league football for the first time, and Butler played at halfback, scoring a try in the 22–22 draw.\nHe is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 24. Butler also played in the second Test loss, altogether appearing in 23 matches on the tour. The following year Butler again represented Australia when they hosted the New Zealand team. At the end of the 1909 NSWRFL season, he was one of the South Sydney players who showed up on Grand Final day to controversially claim the premiership while Balmain forfeited.\nThe following year South Sydney again reached the grand final, and Butler played at halfback in the 4–4 draw with Newtown, who had finished the season higher on the ladder so were awarded the 1910 NSWRFL Premiership. He played 14 games in the 1914 season as Souths finished first and claimed the premiership. 1915 was his last season with South Sydney.\nButler then played two seasons with Glebe, then two seasons with Annandale before retiring.\nIn 1947, Butler died in his Sydney home 9 days short of his 63rd birthday."

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup or the Soccer World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals.\nThe UAE have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on one occasion in 1990 where they lost all three games.\nThe impact of qualifying for the World Cup.\nNumerous nations view their involvement in the World Cup as a strategic move to increase their likelihood of hosting the event in the future. Countries that compete in the tournament have a 17% greater chance of securing the bid for hosting the World Cup. Hosting this prestigious event yields substantial economic advantages and promotes tourism. With its sights set on the National Sports Strategy 2031 objective of enhancing its involvement in multiple international competitions, the United Arab Emirates is eager to capitalize on this occasion.\nUAE national team in the World Cup qualifiers.\n1986 World Cup qualifiers.\nIn 1986, the UAE national football team embarked on its first-ever journey in the World Cup qualifiers. The team competed against several other nations in their qualifying group, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Despite their best efforts, the UAE team could not secure enough wins to progress to the next stage of the qualifiers. Nevertheless, this experience marked an important milestone in the country's football history, paving the way for future generations of players to represent the UAE on the international stage.\n1990 World Cup qualifiers.\nThe UAE national team made history in the 1990 World Cup by earning a place in the finals for the first time. The UAE national team started in the preliminary qualifiers and advanced to the final qualifiers topping their group with 6 points in February 1989.\nIn the last leg of the World Cup qualifiers, the UAE national team competed in a group that included: North Korea, South Korea, China, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Despite winning just one match against the Chinese national team with a one-goal lead, the UAE national team again managed to secure 6 points, securing a commendable second position. The top spot was taken by the South Korean national team, with 8 points. \nThe difficulties faced by the UAE national team.\nThe qualification earned by the UAE national team is a historical accomplishment, not only for being their first, but also for the adversities they had to overcome during the qualifying period. A player for the UAE national team, was suspended before the last match in the qualifiers against South Korea. Along with this setback, the team persevered through adversity as several injured players required medical injections to withstand their injuries and play the match.\nDespite the remarkable achievement of the UAE national team, the UAE Football Association has decided to part ways with coach Mario Zagallo. Mr. Zagallo led the team during the qualifiers, yet he was relieved of his duties only a few days after the team's successful qualification. Coach Carlos Alberto was selected to lead the UAE national football team in the 1990 World Cup finals.\n1990 FIFA World Cup.\nWest Germany vs UAE.\nIsmaïl Mubarak got the only goal for the UAE in the first minute of the second half when he latched onto a ball in the box after a mistake by a German defender and hit a low left footed shot into the net.\nYugoslavia vs UAE.\nThani Jumaa got the only goal for the UAE in the 22nd minute when he headed home from six yards after a cross from the left.\nRecord players.\nNine players have been fielded on all three occasions, making them record World Cup players for their country. Among them are twin brothers Eissa and Ibrahim Meer.\nTop goalscorers.\nTwo UAE players scored one goal each at the 1990 World Cup."

        "title": "California Golden Bears rugby",
        "text": "The California Golden Bears rugby team is the college rugby team of the University of California, Berkeley. The Golden Bears have won 33 championships since the national collegiate championships for rugby began in 1980. Current head coach and Cal alumnus Jack Clark took over the team in 1984, and has achieved prolonged success, leading the Bears to 28 national titles, including twelve consecutive championships from 1991 to 2002, five more consecutive titles from 2004 to 2008, and back-to-back titles in 2010 to 2011 and 2016 to 2017.\nCal also has competed in the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC), the highest profile college rugby sevens tournament in the U.S., winning the title each year from 2013 to 2017. The CRC was held every June from 2011 through 2019 at Subaru Park in the Philadelphia area. Cal also reached the finals of the 2010 CRC, losing to Utah in sudden death extra time, and finished third in the 2012 CRC.\nCal also competes for the \"World Cup,\" which is awarded to the winner of the annual series between Cal and the University of British Columbia.\nCal Rugby's home is at 6,900-seat Witter Rugby Field, located near California Memorial Stadium in Strawberry Canyon.\nHistory.\nRugby began play at Cal in 1882 and continued until 1886, when it was replaced by American football. During the next decade, American football was becoming an increasingly violent sport - the ball carrier would often be pushed and pulled up the field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries. In 1905, 18 deaths and 159 injuries were reported in various football competitions. That year President Theodore Roosevelt lobbied Ivy League representatives to alter the game in order to eliminate or at least reduce its prevalent injuries. This resulted in numerous rule changes agreed upon by the majority of American schools.\nLed by Cal and Stanford, universities of the West Coast took a different path, eliminating America football and changing their game to Rugby union. Other schools that made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). Because the switch to rugby occurred only on the West Coast, the number of teams to play against remained small. This led to schools scheduling games against local clubs and reaching out to rugby powers in Australia, New Zealand, as well as Canada.\nCal and Stanford's traditional rivalry game–the Big Game–became a rugby union match, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays to play for the Cooper Keith Trophy. While Cal won the Cooper cup in 1910, in total it only won three Big Games during this 9 year period. Due to various causes, including students' frustration with the results, the Associated Students of the University of California voted to leave the agreement, and along with other west coast universities, return to American football. From 1906 to 1914, Cal's rugby record was 78 wings, 21 losses and 10 ties. Following the switch back to football, Cal continued to play rugby, but it was officially considered to be a \"minor\" sport.\nPrimarily Cal, Stanford, and Santa Clara players composed the two US Olympic rugby teams (1920 &amp; 1924) and claimed fame by winning both Gold medals. Prior to the introduction of Rugby 7s at the 2016 Summer Olympics, 1924 was the last time the Olympic Games staged a rugby competition.\nIn 1931, rugby returned under alumnus Ed Graff. 1938 began the era of Miles \"Doc\" Hudson, who guided the Bears for 37 years and an incredible record of 339-84-23. His successor was Ned Anderson, an alumnus and former rugger for the Bears.\nIn September 2010, the university announced that rugby would be one of five varsity sports cut as a cost-cutting measure, though the team would have continued to represent the university as a \"varsity club sport.\" A large group of rugby supporters organized and disputed the relegation. On February 11, 2011, the administration reversed its decision on rugby and two other sports, and rugby was continued as a varsity sport.\nMark Bingham who played for the Golden Bears in the early 1990s was a passenger on board United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001.\nCal reached the final of the Varsity Cup every year of the five year competition, winning in 2017 and 2018.\nTeam performances.\nNational championships.\nThe following table is a list of each of the national championships since 1980 in which Cal has reached at least the semifinals.\n†Indicates year in which Cal won the now defunct Varsity Cup.\nVarsity Cup.\nThe following table is a list of each of the Varsity Cups in which Cal has reached at least the semifinals.\nNational team players.\nUnited States.\nMajor international competitions..\nFollowing players have played for the Eagles, the United States national rugby team in major international competitions.\nOf the 30-man squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, 7 were Cal alums."

        "text": "The 2012–13 Rugby-Bundesliga was the 42nd edition of this competition and the 93rd edition of the German rugby union championship. In the Rugby-Bundesliga, twenty-two teams played in, initially, four regional divisions, the first stage of the competition. The season started on 25 August 2012 and finished with the championship final on 15 June 2013, interrupted by a winter break from 25 November to 3 March. The regular season finished on Wednesday 1 May and the play-offs started on the following weekend, 4 May, and the German championship final was held on 15 June 2013.\nThe defending champions were Heidelberger RK who defeated TV Pforzheim in the 2012 final to take out its eights championship and third in a row. Heidelberger RK took out the national championship once more, remaining unbeaten all season and defeating local rival SC Neuenheim 41–10 in the final.\nOverview.\nThe league has been radically modified from the 2011–12 season. In 2011–12 the league operated with ten teams playing in a single division in a home-and-away format with semi-finals and a final at the end. In 2012–13 the league has been expanded, initially to twenty-four teams, which were to play in four regional divisions of six teams each. In those each team would play the others in its division just once. However, two teams resigned from the league before the start of the season, reducing the number of clubs to twenty-two. The Berlin Grizzlies of the eastern division opted to form a team with the reserve side of USV Potsdam Rugby and play in the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga instead. DRC Hannover withdrew from the northern division just before the first game of the season, suffering from a lack of first team players and entered the tier three Rugby-Regionalliga instead for 2012–13.\nThe first stage of the competition, the \"Vorrunde\", will finish on 3 October 2012 after which the second stage will start, the \"Qualifikationsphase\", in which the top four teams each from the southern and the western group play each other in one group while the top teams from the north and east play each other in another. The finals series will be expanded from four to eight teams. The six teams not qualified for the \"Qualifikationsphase\" will enter the \"DRV-Pokal\", the German rugby union cup, together with the top eight teams of the 2nd Bundesliga. The 2nd Bundesliga teams not qualified for the \"DRV-Pokal\" will play for the \"Liga Pokal\".\nIn the second stage the teams within a group will play each other in a home-and-away format, with the teams that already played each other in the first stage carrying over those results. All sixteen clubs will qualify for the knock-out stage.\nOne of the main aims of the reform was to reduce the number of kilometres traveled by individual teams and therefore reduce the travel expenses. Additionally, the 2nd Bundesliga was also expanded to 24 teams.\nBecause of the enlargement of the league from ten to twenty-two (initially twenty-four) teams no club was relegated after the 2011–12 season but twelve clubs promoted:\nTwo clubs finished the regular season unbeaten, DSV 78 Hannover and Heidelberger RK. Of the sixteen clubs qualified for the play-offs three decided to cancel their first round match, the three bottom placed clubs in the north east, Berliner SV 92, Victoria Linden and USV Potsdam, with all three games awarded 50-0 to the opposition. The quarter finals saw the south western clubs dominate with all four advancing teams being from that division and all north eastern clubs being knocked out. The semi finals were heavily affected by bad weather, with both games, to be held in Heidelberg, being canceled and rescheduled. The final saw Heidelberger RK defeat SC Neuenheim 41–10 to take out its ninth national championship and fourth consecutive one.\nBundesliga tables &amp; results.\nFirst stage.\nIn the first stage twenty-two clubs played in four groups. Within each group each team played the other just once.

Within each group each team played the others home and away except for the match-ups that already had been played in the first round. The results of those were carried over. All teams in this stage qualified for the play-offs and were seeded according to the final standings.\nNorth-East.\nThe table and results of the division:\nSouth-West.\nThe table and results of the division:\nPlay-off stage.\nIn the play-offs the sixteen qualified clubs play a knock-out competition in single game format with the winner moving on to the next round. In the first round of the play-off the north-east division clubs play against the south-west division clubs. The play-offs began on 4 May with the round of sixteen, followed by the quarter-finals on 25 May, semi finals on 1 June and the German championship final on 15 June 2013. However, both semi final games, to be held in Heidelberg, had to be postponed because of bad weather, and rescheduled for 12 June."

        "title": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)",
        "text": "Kyle Forman Anderson (born September 20, 1993), also known as Li Kaier (), is an American-Chinese professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born in the United States, he played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. After earning All-American honors as a sophomore in 2013–14, he declared for the 2014 NBA draft and was selected in the first round with the 30th overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs.\nNicknamed \"Slow Mo\", Anderson developed the ball-handling skills of a point guard at an early age, but his height provided him the versatility to play as a forward. As a high school player in New Jersey, Anderson led his teams to two consecutive state titles, and was named state player of the year during his senior year. One of the top recruits out of high school, Anderson was named second-team all-conference in the Pac-12 as a freshman at UCLA while playing mostly at forward. The following season, he moved to point guard, and was voted the Most Outstanding Player of the Pac-12 tournament as the Bruins won their first conference tournament title in six years. He played four seasons with San Antonio before signing with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2018. After four seasons with the Grizzlies, he signed with the Timberwolves. In 2023, Anderson became a naturalized Chinese citizen ahead of the FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nEarly life.\nAnderson was born on September 20, 1993, in New York City, and grew up in New Jersey in North Bergen before moving to Fairview while in high school. He attended his first basketball camp at the age of three. Anderson's father, who played basketball at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) and became a longtime high school coach in New Jersey, groomed him to be a point guard. Although Anderson was tall, his father did not want him to be \"pigeonholed\" as a post player. He had his son play with older players on Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teams; usually the smallest player on the court, Anderson developed point guard skills early while passing to his larger teammates.\nHe began his high school career at Paterson Catholic High School. Although he possessed the skills of a point guard, his height led coaches to play him on the wing or in the post. After two years at Paterson Catholic, the school closed, and Anderson moved to St. Anthony High School. Overall, he compiled 119–6 record as a four-year starter, including 65–0 in his two years at St. Anthony. When St. Anthony captured its second straight New Jersey Tournament of champions title and concluded its second straight undefeated season with a 66–62 victory over Plainfield, Anderson was the team's third-leading scorer with 14 points. Still, St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley said Anderson was the team's \"heart and soul and he was the reason we won the game.’’ For the season, Anderson led the team in scoring (14.7 points per game), rebounding (6.5 per game), assists (3.9 per game), blocked shots (2.0 per game) and deflections. \"The Star-Ledger\" named him their state boys basketball Player of the Year. He received national recognition as a \"Parade\" All-American, McDonald's All-American, and he was invited to play in the Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit. In spite of all the praise he had received in his career, Anderson was described by Hurley as \"unassuming\", which the coach credited to Anderson's family doing a \"great job keeping him balanced.\"\nThe Anderson was often listed as a small forward, but still considered himself a point guard. Among 2012 recruits, he was ranked the No. 1 small forward by Rivals.com, and No. 2 by ESPN.com and Scout.com behind Shabazz Muhammad. Hurley called Anderson's passing \"his best asset.\"\nCollege career.\nAnderson committed on September 19, 2011, to attending University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to play Division I basketball for the Bruins. He had also considered Seton Hall, Georgetown, Florida and St. John's. A major factor in his decision was UCLA coach Ben Howland's record of grooming successful point guards in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Anderson and Muhammad were the top players in the Bruins' recruiting class, which was considered the best in the nation. Howland had Anderson mostly playing off the ball, while Larry Drew II was the Bruins' primary ball handler. Playing primarily as a power forward, Anderson finished the season with averages of 9.7 points, 8.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists. Though he struggled at times under Howland's strict offense, he led the team in rebounding and was the only player ranked in the top 10 in the Pac-12 in both rebounds and assists. He was the first Pac-12 player since UCLA's Bill Walton as a senior in 1973–74 to have at least 300 rebounds and 100 assists in the same season. Anderson was named to the All-Pac-12 second team and the Pac-12 All-Freshman team. Projected by NBA executives to be chosen in the first half of the second round of the 2013 NBA draft if he declared himself eligible, Anderson gave major consideration to leaving college.\nAnderson decided to return to UCLA in 2013–14, which he and his family figured would be his final season in college. With a field goal percentage of just 41.6% during the previous season, he worked on improving his shooting from midrange and beyond during the offseason. New Bruins coach Steve Alford, who replaced the fired Howland, moved Anderson back to his natural position at point guard. Under Alford's new wide-open offense, he played more confidently and displayed an improved jump shot. On November 22, 2013, he had 13 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists in an 81–70 win over Morehead State; it was the school's first triple-double since Toby Bailey in 1995. On November 29, UCLA was co-champion of the Continental Tire Las Vegas Invitational with Missouri, and Anderson was named the tournament's MVP, as the Bruins started the season with a 7–0 record. On February 27, Anderson and Jordan Adams missed one game after being suspended for a violation of team rules. Anderson was honored as the Most Outstanding Player of the 2014 Pac-12 tournament, which UCLA won for their first conference tournament title in six years. In the championship game, Anderson contributed 21 points, 15 rebounds and five assists in a 75–71 upset of No. 4 nationally ranked Arizona. \"I don’t know that I’ve ever seen [those numbers] and just one turnover for a point guard,” said Arizona coach Sean Miller of Anderson's performance.\nAveraging 14.9 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game, Anderson was called \"the nation's top triple-double threat\" by the \"Orange County Register\". He led the team in both rebounds and assists and was voted the team's most valuable player (MVP). Nationally, he ranked sixth in assists and first among power conference players. Anderson was also third in the Pac-12 in rebounds and steals (1.8) per game. He was the first player in Pac-12 history to register 200 rebounds and 200 assists in a season, as well as the first Division I player with at least 500 points, 300 rebounds and 200 assists in a season. Anderson's field goal percentage improved by seven percentage points from his freshman year, while his three-point field goal percentage jump from 21 to 48 percent. The Associated Press and \"Sporting News\" named Anderson a third-team All-American, and he was voted to the All-Pac-12 first team as well as first team all-district by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). He was a finalist for the Oscar Robertson Trophy, given by USBWA to the most outstanding college player; along with Shabazz Napier, they were the only players to also be on the midseason watchlists for the Naismith College Player of the Year, John R. Wooden Award, and Bob Cousy Award.\nProfessional career.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2014–2018).\nOn April 16, 2014, Anderson announced that he would forgo his remaining collegiate eligibility and enter the 2014 NBA draft. While he disproved detractors who thought his style would not translate to success at the major college level, critics also said his lack of quickness would be an impediment in the NBA. Many teams projected him as a power forward, with some comparing him to Boris Diaw, a longtime NBA player with point forward skills who also plays at a leisurely pace.\nGenerally projected as a late first-round pick, Anderson was selected in the first round with the 30th overall pick of the draft by the San Antonio Spurs, who had recently won the 2014 NBA Finals. On July 12, 2014, he signed with the Spurs and joined them for the Las Vegas Summer League. In six summer league games, he spent most of the time on the wing with some minutes at power forward, but rarely as a point guard. Anderson began the 2014–15 season as the team's lone new player, with the rest of its championship roster intact. The Spurs often rested its starters, resulting in playing time for Anderson. He made his NBA debut four games into the season, playing a team-high 31 minutes in a 98–81 loss to the Houston Rockets, while coach Gregg Popovich rested veteran stars Tim Duncan and Manu Ginóbili in the second game of a back-to-back set for the Spurs. Anderson shot just 1-of-8, but displayed his skill set with eight rebounds, four assists and two steals; he also acted as San Antonio's primary ball handler during the fourth quarter. On December 10 with five Spurs out due to a combination of injuries or rest, Anderson made his first NBA start and scored nine points in a 109–95 win over the New York Knicks. He continued to receive playing time while starting small forward Kawhi Leonard remained out for an extended period with a hand injury.\nDuring his rookie season, he has also had multiple assignments with the Austin Spurs of the NBA Development League. On February 9, he was named the D-League Performer of the Week. Austin went 2–0 that week, while Anderson logged back-to-back double-doubles and averaged 19.0 points, 11.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.5 blocks. He was named the NBA Development League Player of the Month for February, when he averaged 22.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 4.7 assists, leading Austin to an 8–1 record.\nDuring the offseason, Anderson played with the Spurs in the 2015 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. In seven games, he averaged 21.0 points and 6.0 rebounds in 27.3 minutes, and was named the league's MVP. He became a regular part of San Antonio's rotation in 2015–16, appearing in 78 games while averaging 16 minutes. On March 28, 2016, he played 36 minutes and recorded 13 points, seven assists, and four steals in a 101–87 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He established career highs in minutes and assists. Anderson had a career-high 11 rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench in an April 7 loss to the Golden State Warriors. In the regular season finale, he had his first double-double in the NBA with 15 points and 10 rebounds, leading the short-handed Spurs to a 96–91 win over the Dallas Mavericks. He matched his career-high in points, while adding a career-best five steals.\nAnderson participated in the Summer League again in 2016, and Spurs summer league coach Becky Hammon declared him the top player in the league. He averaged a league-high 23.7 points in three games in the Utah league, and followed up with averages of 18.5 points and six rebounds in two games in Las Vegas, when the Spurs sent him home after they were content he had nothing left to prove in the league. He played 72 games including 14 starts in 2016–17, but his overall performance regressed. The Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs in the Western Conference Finals, when Anderson scored a season-high 20 points and added seven rebounds and four steals in the season-ending Game 4 loss to the Golden State. Without any Summer League commitments for the first time as a pro, Anderson wanted to build off of his Game 4 performance. Over the summer, he worked on finishing shots around the rim and getting in shape to be light enough to play at guard or small forward while also being strong enough to also play at power forward.\nWith Leonard out an extended period with a quadriceps injury, Anderson began 2017–18 as a starter. On November 20, 2017, he had 13 points and a career-high 10 assists in a 96–85 win over the Atlanta Hawks. At Oklahoma City on December 3, Anderson started at power forward in place of a resting LaMarcus Aldridge when he suffered a grade 1 strain to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of his left knee in the third quarter. He was subsequently ruled out for an estimated two weeks. Through 23 games, Anderson had been averaging career highs of 8.9 points, six rebounds and three assists. Popovich expected him to remain in the regular rotation even after Leonard returned. Anderson returned to action after missing eight games. In March 2018, he was moved to power forward as the Spurs went to a smaller lineup with Aldridge at center and Pau Gasol moving to the bench. On March 19, he was the first NBA player in the season to be scoreless and yet still post a +30 plus–minus rating in an 89–75 win over the Warriors. With Leonard missing most of the season, Anderson made 67 starts and ended the season averaging career highs in minutes (26.7 per game), points (7.9), rebounds (5.4), assists (2.7), steals (1.6), blocks (0.8) and field goal percentage (52.7).\nMemphis Grizzlies (2018–2022).\nAfter the 2017–18 season, Anderson became a restricted free agent. He signed a four-year deal with the Grizzlies worth $37.2 million after the Spurs declined to match the offer sheet. Popovich said the figure was \"beyond the pale for us\", but he was happy for Anderson. The Grizzlies' interest was strengthened by Memphis assistant coach Chad Forcier, a former Spurs assistant who Popovich credited along with Chip Engelland for developing Anderson. Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace called Anderson their \"main target\" in free agency, and vice president of basketball operations John Hollinger cited the value in his ballhandling and playmaking ability. Anderson's role as a point forward increased in his last year with San Antonio, who were 14–2 during his four years when he had five or more assists. On November 10, 2018, Anderson had eight points and a career-high 13 rebounds in a 112–106 overtime win over the Philadelphia 76ers. He followed up with a second straight game with 13 rebounds in a loss to the Utah Jazz. In his first return to San Antonio on November 21, Anderson had nine points and nine rebounds in a team-high 38 minutes in a 104–103 win over the Spurs. In January 2019, he missed two weeks with an ankle injury. He returned for two games before being sidelined beginning in February with a nagging shoulder injury. In April, he underwent thoracic outlet decompression surgery to address his right shoulder soreness and other affiliated symptoms. Anderson said doctors removed his top rib to free the nerve flow from his neck to his right hand. The operation required him to retrain himself to shoot again.\nAnderson was still experiencing discomfort from the shoulder surgery as preseason began in 2019–20, and there were doubts on his health for the upcoming season. However, his recovery went well during the regular season. Under new Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins's fast-paced system, Anderson played as both a starter and reserve while being used as a small forward, power forward and center.\nIn 2020–21, Anderson opened the season with double figures in rebounds in each of the first two games, including a career-high 14 rebounds while tying his personal best with 20 points against Atlanta on December 26, 2020. He logged consecutive 10+ rebound games for the second time in his career, and it was his first game with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds. In the following game against the Brooklyn Nets, Anderson had career highs of 28 points and four 3-pointers in a 116–111 overtime win after teammate Ja Morant was lost for the game with an ankle injury in the second quarter. It was the first time Anderson scored at least 20 points in consecutive games. On May 10, 2021, he logged a career-high four blocks as the team tied a franchise record with 19 blocks in 115–110 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, which clinched a spot for Memphis in the play-in tournament. During the season, Anderson made a team-high 69 starts, playing mostly at power forward for the first time in his career. He increased his 3-point shooting after having never made more than 24 in a season and only once shooting above 33.3% in any of his six previous years in the league. In the Grizzlies' first play-in game, he tied his career high of four blocks in a 100–96 win that eliminated the Spurs. In their playoff opener at Utah, he set a Memphis franchise single-game playoff record with six steals and added 14 points in 112–109 win over the top-seeded Jazz.\nAnderson moved to the bench the following season after Memphis decided to emphasize Jaren Jackson Jr., coupled with their acquisition of Steven Adams. On March 3, 2022, Anderson had a career-high six steals against the Boston Celtics. In the first round of the 2022 playoffs against the Minnesota Timberwolves, he started the second half of Game 2, and entered the starting lineup in Game 3 in place of Adams. Anderson was the primary defender against Karl-Anthony Towns. Xavier Tillman became the starter in Game 4.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2022–present).\nOn July 8, 2022, Anderson signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. On December 9, Anderson scored 15 points and recorded a season-high 12 assists during a 118–108 win against the Utah Jazz.\nOn April 9, 2023, during a win against the New Orleans Pelicans, Anderson was involved in an altercation with his teammate, Rudy Gobert. Gobert struck Anderson after a verbal exchange, resulting in Gobert being escorted off the court. Gobert did not return to the game, and was later sent home from the locker room. In his first season with the Timberwolves, Anderson avergaged 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game.\nNational team career.\nAnderson participated in U16 and U17 training camps for USA Basketball prior to being named to the 2009–10 USA Basketball Men's Developmental National Team. In 2012, he started at power forward for the USA Basketball Junior National Select Team that competed at the Nike Hoop Summit, which featured the top American high school seniors against a team of international players aged 19 or younger.\nIn 2023, Anderson said that he would consider playing for the Chinese national team. On July 24, 2023, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that he had obtained Chinese citizenship in advance of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nPlayer profile.\nOut of high school, Anderson was considered capable of playing any of four positions on the court, from point guard to power forward, drawing comparisons to basketball legend Magic Johnson. Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, \"I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him do a lot of what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player.\" During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was \"starting to look more and more like the Magic Johnson of the 2013–14 season in college basketball.\" ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that \"he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.” \"USA Today\" commented that he was \"kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson\".\n\"The Seattle Times\" called Anderson the \"[m]ost versatile player in years in the Pac-12.\" In 2014, SI.com said he \"[m]ight be the most versatile player in the country.\" Rarely has a player of Anderson's stature—standing with a wingspan of —been entrusted to run the offense of a college team. He was a unique talent with a size advantage to post up smaller defenders down low, and the ball-handling skills to run the offense from the top of the key. He was comfortable playing both in the post and on the perimeter, and could direct the offense as either a point guard or point forward. One of the top rebounding guards in college, Anderson was the rare point guard that could rebound the ball and single-handedly initiate a fast break. He was often described as a \"nightmare\" matchup for opponents.\nAnderson plays at a deliberate pace, and he is not as fast as more athletically gifted players. Popovich stated that he is \"not what you’d call a typical NBA athlete\". However, Anderson is praised for his basketball IQ. He is able to change speeds and fake out his opponents to keep them off balance. His methodical style earned him the nickname \"Slow Mo\" in eighth grade in AAU, and the name has stuck with him. \"[He] really understands how to use his speed—he's not super fast, but he's super bright and really knows how to use angles,\" said Kevin Boyle, who coached Anderson on the national team in 2012. \"USA Today\" described him as \"languid but quick enough to lead the fast break\". Anderson's defense was considered a weakness. In college, his teams usually played zone as he struggled containing smaller, quicker guards while playing man-to-man. His defense improved with the Spurs in 2017–18, when he guarded both forward positions while leveraging his wingspan and instincts. Against quicker small forwards, he uses his physicality to keep players off balance.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson is the son of Kyle Sr. and Suzanne Anderson. His grandfather, Clifton Anderson, played college football at Indiana and had a two-year professional career in the National Football League (NFL) with the Chicago Cardinals in 1952 and the New York Giants in 1953. Anderson's maternal grandmother grew up in Jamaica; her father was Chinese and married a Jamaican woman, and they lived in Jamaica among the Chinese Jamaicans. After researching his ancestry, Anderson visited China in 2018 to meet distant family in Shenzhen."

He ran back a punt 90 yards for a touchdown in a 53–0 victory over Butler University that year. Dewar joined the U.S. Army in 1943 during World War II and played service football at Camp Grant in Rockford, Illinois. He was selected in 1944 to play in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League champion and a squad composed of the country's best college players. After the war, Dewar returned for a final season at Indiana.\nProfessional career.\nDewar was selected with the 173rd pick in the 1947 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He instead joined the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference, who had selected him in the 1947 AAFC Draft along with former Indiana teammate Bob Cowan. The Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and won the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. After a year with the team, Dewar was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Established as the Gillette Cup in 1963, the knock-out trophy expanded from 32 teams to 60 teams in 1999, featuring all of the minor counties, and the Cricket Board teams from the first-class counties. The Cricket Board teams were considered to be roughly equivalent talent to the minor counties, and they all entered in the first or second round, prior to the first-class counties who entered in the third round. The SCB did not win any of their List A matches, being eliminated in the round they entered in each of the five tournaments they took part in.\nOnly two players took part in all five of the SCB's List A matches; Kevin Parsons and Mathew Dimond. Parsons captained the SCB in all five matches, and was also the team's highest aggregate run-scorer, accumulating 125 runs for the team, while Dimond took more wickets for the SCB than any other player, claiming six during his matches for the team. Arul Suppiah, who only played for the team once, scored 70 runs in an innings against Cornwall in 2002, the team's highest score. Another player who only appeared once for the side, Matthew Bulbeck, has the best bowling figures for the team, after taking five wickets against Norfolk in 2001. That performance also gives him the best bowling average amongst SCB players, with 3.60. In all, 31 players have appeared for the SCB, of which ten have also made first-class cricket appearances.\nPlayers are initially listed in order of appearance, where players made their debut in the same match, they are ordered by batting order."

The head coach, Jim Boeheim, served for his 37th year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York and was a member of the Big East Conference. This team reached the Final Four for the fifth time in program history.\nPreseason outlook.\nSyracuse began the season ranked #9 in the Coaches' Poll and the AP poll, the second-highest ranking among Big East teams behind Louisville. In a poll of Big East coaches, Syracuse was predicted to finish second in the conference. In this same poll, the coaches named Brandon Triche to their all-Big East second team. C. J. Fair received an honorable mention.\nA poll of writers in Big East cities predicted Syracuse would finish second in the conference. Triche, Fair and Michael Carter-Williams were named to the writers' all-Big East second team.\nRoster changes.\nSyracuse returned five players that had significant playing time last season (three players that earned starts and two that came off the bench), while losing four significant contributors.\nSyracuse graduated two players that started every game during the previous season: senior point guard Scoop Jardine and senior forward Kris Joseph. Sophomore guard Dion Waiters, who averaged 24 minutes per game in the 2011–12 season, left school early to enter the NBA draft, as did sophomore center Fab Melo, who was a starter before the university ruled him academically ineligible toward the end of the season.\nThe starting line-up for the first half of the current season featured three players who started games in the previous season: senior guard Brandon Triche, junior forward C.J. Fair and sophomore forward Rakeem Christmas.\nSophomore guard Michael Carter-Williams, who did not start in the previous season, but played an average of 10 minutes per game, entered the starting line-up in the 2012–13 season, along with true freshman forward DaJuan Coleman.\nNine players have earned more than 10 minutes per game in the first half of the season. Senior James Southerland was averaging 26 minutes per game through 16 games before Syracuse University ruled him ineligible in January 2013. The three other players who have been playing off the bench for the team this season are redshirt freshman guard Trevor Cooney, freshman forward Jerami Grant and junior center Baye Moussa Keita. Keita also played off the bench last season.\nBy January of the 2012–13 season, more than halfway through, Syracuse was playing with just seven scholarship players due to Dajuan Coleman's knee injury and James Southerland's suspension. Coleman was Syracuse's starting center at the beginning of the season and Southerland led the team in three point scoring coming off the bench before his suspension. Head coach Boeheim said he thinks a rotation of seven or eight players is enough to compete.\nCurrent depth chart.\nThe three players on this year's team that consistently have earned the most playing time have been Triche, Fair and Carter-Williams. Cooney has been coming off the bench to spell the guards this season, while four back-line players (Coleman, Christmas, Keita and Grant) have been rounding out the line up. Total combined production from these four players has varied significantly.\nJim Boeheim milestones.\nJim Boeheim became only the third coach to win 900 men's NCAA Division I games on December 17, 2012 when Syracuse defeated Detroit, 72–68. On December 31, 2012, Jim Boeheim won his 902nd game tying Bob Knight for second-most men's NCAA Division I victories with a 96–62 win over Central Connecticut. Boeheim passed Knight to gain sole possession of second place behind Mike Krzyzewski when Syracuse defeated Rutgers 78–53 on January 2, 2013.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF6F00; color:#212B6D;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF6F00; color:#212B6D;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF6F00; color:#212B6D;\" | Big East Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF6F00; color:#212B6D;\" | Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF6F00; color:#212B6D;\" | NCAA tournament"

        "text": "Craig Robertson (born February 11, 1988) is a former American football linebacker. He was signed by the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent in 2011. Robertson played college football at North Texas.\nHigh school career.\nCraig Robertson attended Stafford High School in Stafford, Texas.\nRobertson played many positions in high school, including option quarterback, running back, cornerback, wide receiver, kicker and punter. Robertson was also an all-star performer in basketball and baseball. He was also an honor roll student and member of student council while prepping at Stafford High School. Following a stellar career on and off the field at Stafford, Robertson chose to play football at the University of North Texas. Robertson is one of only three former football players from Stafford High School to play in the NFL.\nCollege career.\nThe athletic Robertson was initially recruited to play safety at North Texas. However, Robertson displayed a physicality that coaches felt would be better served at linebacker. After redshirting his freshman year, Robertson became the starter at linebacker midway through his redshirt freshman season, a position he held the remainder of his collegiate career. During his tenure at North Texas, Robertson earned All-America honors as a freshman, and Sun Belt All-Conference honors as a sophomore and senior. As a senior, Robertson led the conference in solo tackles and total tackles.\nWhile attending North Texas, Robertson became a member of Phi Gamma chapter of Omega Psi Phi fraternity.\nProfessional career.\n2011.\nRobertson went undrafted in the 2011 NFL Draft and did not receive any offers to sign as an undrafted free agent or invitations to tryout during rookie minicamp.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn December 19, 2011, the Cleveland Browns signed Robertson to their practice squad after he attended a tryout. He remained on the practice squad for the last two games of the regular season.\n2012.\nOn January 3, 2012, the Cleveland Browns signed Robertson to a two-year, $870,000 reserve/futures contract.\nThroughout OTA's and training camp, he competed for a roster spot, as a backup linebacker, against James-Michael Johnson, Quinton Spears, Kaluka Maiava, Emmanuel Acho, Ben Jacobs, L. J. Fort, and JoJo Dickson. Head coach Pat Shurmur named Robertson the backup outside linebacker, behind Scott Fujita, Kakula Maiava, and James-Michael Johnson, to begin the regular season.\nHe had an opportunity to play immediately on defense after rookie Emmanuel Acho was placed on injured reserve due to an undisclosed injury, starting outside linebacker Chris Gocong was placed on IR after tearing his Achilles tendon during camp in August, and the Browns' other starting outside linebacker, Scott Fujita, was suspended for the first three games due to his participation in the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Cleveland Browns' season-opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and recorded nine combined tackles, two pass deflections, and made his first career interception off a pass by quarterback Michael Vick in their 17–16 loss.

        "text": "The men's coxed four competition at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich took place from 27 August to 2 September at the Olympic Reggatta Course in Oberschleißheim. There were 14 boats (70 competitors) from 14 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by West Germany; it was the nation's first medal as a separate team, but the third time in four Games that a West German crew had won gold (with crews from West Germany winning in 1960 and 1964 under the flag of the United Team of Germany). East Germany repeated as silver medallists, though with a new crew. Bronze went to Czechoslovakia, the nation's first medal in the men's coxed four since 1952.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nNew Zealand's victory at the 1968 Olympics had been a surprise; teams from both East and West Germany had been dominant before then (winning the 1960 and 1964 Olympics, 1962 and 1966 World Championships, and most of the European championships). The Germans continued their form between Mexico City and Munich, with West Germany winning and East Germany the runner-up at the 1970 World Championship, along with both the 1969 and 1971 European championships. The two German crews were heavily favoured again at the 1972 Games.\nFor the third time in five Games, no nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its 12th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used in 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960 as well as the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top three of each heat advanced to the semifinal round; the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe top three finishers advanced to the semifinal round.\nSemifinals.\nFirst three qualify to the Final A, remainder to Final B."

After overcoming slow starts in his first two matches, Murray made it to the final, defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov in straight sets to claim his 22nd career title. Murray then made it to the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships defeating Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, only to lose to Roger Federer in the final. After a loss in his opening match in Indian Wells, Murray made it to the final of the Miami Masters for the second time, where he was ultimately defeated by Djokovic in the final. Murray's clay court season was hampered by a back injury, meaning he didn't make it beyond the quarterfinals of any event, ultimately losing to David Ferrer in the last eight at Roland Garros. During the summer, Murray made it to his first ever final at Wimbledon, in which he was ultimately defeated by Federer in four sets. Murray however made his most impressive of comebacks from a Grand Slam final defeat, at the London Olympics four weeks later, staged once again at the All-England Club. Murray made it through to the final with ease, including a straight sets defeat of Novak Djokovic, to set up a rematch with Federer, once again on Wimbledon Centre Court. In a complete reversal of fortunes, Murray defeated Federer over five sets for the first time, handing the Swiss his worst defeat ever on grass to take the gold medal in straight sets, for the loss of just 7 games. \nIt was during the American hardcourt season that Murray recorded his most significant victory. After retiring early in Toronto, and suffering a third round defeat by Milos Raonic in Cincinnati, Murray made his way to New York for the 2012 US Open at Flushing Meadows. The scot made it to his second consecutive Grand Slam final, where once again he faced Novak Djokovic, the fifth time the two had met in 2012. After losing a two sets to love lead, Murray regained his prior momentum to take the deciding set, and clinch his first ever Grand Slam victory. In winning the US Open, Murray became the first British man to win a Grand Slam title in 76 years, the last winner being Fred Perry in 1936. His victory at Flushing Meadows also set several records for Murray, the final featured the longest ever tiebreak in a US Open final (12-10 was the score in the first set tiebreak), and the match itself was the joint longest in history (tied with the 1988 final, in which Murray's coach Ivan Lendl competed). In addition, Murray also became the first man ever to win Olympic Gold and the US Open in the same calendar year.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Murray in 2012, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins.

Both teams had 75 wins, however the Hawks had one less loss than the Orions because of a game against the Daiei Stars that ended in a tie earlier in the season. Because of the impact the tie had on the pennant race, the Hawks and the Stars played an extra 121st game. The Hawks won the game, giving them sole claim to Pacific League title. After the season, this faux playoff system was scrapped because of criticism that it was unfair to the three non-qualifying teams that had their seasons truncated."

        "title": "New Zealand cricket team in England in 2013",
        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team was in England from 4 May to 27 June 2013 for a tour consisting of two Test matches, three One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 International matches. The New Zealand team also competed in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy between the ODI series and T20I series. The tour followed England's tour of New Zealand two months earlier.\nBefore the tour, there were fears that a number of New Zealand players might have been unavailable for the start of the tour due to a schedule overlap with the 2013 Indian Premier League. The contract between New Zealand Cricket and the players' association entitles the players to five weeks of IPL competition as New Zealand cricketers earn more money from IPL play than from international play for New Zealand Cricket.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nThe 1st Test started slowly, with England scoring just 160 runs in the 80 overs that were managed before rain curtailed the day's play. None of the four wickets taken during the day were for more than 40 runs, leaving Joe Root (25) and Jonny Bairstow (3) at the crease overnight. The pair added another 32 runs at the start of day 2 before the loss of Root's wicket in the 16th over of the day brought about a batting collapse; England went from 192/5 to 232 all out in the space of just under 18 overs, and none of the last five batsmen reached double figures.\nJames Anderson gave England a chance at a perfect response by taking the wickets of both New Zealand openers to join Ian Botham, Bob Willis and Fred Trueman as one of four English bowlers to have taken 300 Test wickets. New Zealand fought back through top-scorer Ross Taylor, who hit a fast-paced 66 off 72 balls before being trapped LBW to Anderson, and Kane Williamson, who ended the day unbeaten on 44. Dean Brownlie's was the last wicket of the day to fall, bringing captain Brendon McCullum to the crease with New Zealand on 153/4 at the close of play. However, McCullum lasted just five balls the following morning, caught behind for 2 runs off the bowling of Stuart Broad. It was the wicket of Williamson that spelled New Zealand's downfall, though, the last four wickets falling for 30 runs in fewer than 10 overs. Anderson's wicket of Bruce Martin gave him his fourth Test five-wicket haul at Lord's.\nWith a 25-run lead, England knew they would need to open up a decent margin over New Zealand in their second innings to take the match away from the tourists. Despite the loss of both captain Alastair Cook and Nick Compton in the first 10 overs, England started well, as Jonathan Trott and Joe Root built a third-wicket partnership of 123, the only century partnership in the match. However, the loss of Root for 71 with the last ball of the 50th over was the beginning of the end. Trott achieved his half-century in the following over, but Bairstow's wicket fell soon after, followed by Matt Prior, who picked up a pair off Tim Southee. Trott was out himself two overs before the close of play, and England finished on 180/6. On the fourth morning, Southee went on to tear through the English lower order, which included an out-of-sorts Ian Bell, who had spent most of the previous day recovering from flu-like symptoms. England were eventually all out for 213 in just 68.3 overs, despite having been 159/2 in the 50th. Only Stuart Broad showed any resistance, scoring an unbeaten 26, and it was a sign of things to come.\nNew Zealand were set a target of 239 for victory, and although that would have made it the highest-scoring innings in the match, they had five sessions in which to do it. However, what followed was a master-class in bowling from Broad, who took seven wickets for 44 runs in just 11 overs – his best Test figures – as New Zealand were bowled out for 68, their sixth-lowest score in Tests against England. Only BJ Watling and Neil Wagner managed to make it into double figures, theirs being two of the three wickets that Broad did not manage to take. Watling was not helped by a knee injury he had picked up on day 3 that meant McCullum had to keep wicket for the rest of the innings, but he nevertheless came out to bat, only to be caught in the slips off Anderson for 13. Wagner's wicket was the last to fall; it looked as though he would be caught after hitting the ball straight up in the air to long leg, but the fielder missed the catch. In the confusion that followed, the ball was thrown back to Anderson at the bowler's end with Wagner stranded mid-pitch in the middle of his second run. With that, the day's play concluded with 14 wickets in less than two sessions and England went 1–0 up in the two-match series.\n2nd Test.\nNew Zealand made a couple of forced changes for the second Test, with Brendon McCullum keeping wicket in place of the injured BJ Watling, Martin Guptill filling Watling's role with the bat, while Doug Bracewell came in for spinner Bruce Martin to form a four-man seam attack. The first day was completely washed out by rain, which, although there were some breaks in the cloud, was never away long enough to allow the toss to be made. With play abandoned before 4 p.m., the match was effectively turned into a four-day game. After losing Compton (1) early on day 2, England recovered well, with Cook and Trott putting on another 50 runs before both were dismissed in consecutive balls in the last two overs before lunch; however, this only brought Joe Root to the crease, and he proceeded to add 104 more runs for his maiden Test century, becoming the first Yorkshireman to do so at Headingley. Root was out to the first delivery with the new ball, but not before he and fellow Yorkshireman Jonny Bairstow had added 124 for the fifth wicket. Bairstow (64) went next, followed by Broad for a second-ball duck, but Prior and Swann combined to get England to 337/7 by the end of the day. England's tail only lasted another nine overs on day 3, enough to round the innings off for 354 runs. Trent Boult took the last two wickets of Steven Finn (6) and Anderson (0) to complete a five-wicket haul.\nNew Zealand started their response well, Fulton and Rutherford putting on 55 runs for the opening wicket; however, the introduction of Finn into the bowling attack ended the openers' resistance shortly before the lunch break. New Zealand then quickly went from 62/2 to 122/9, as Swann was able to exploit the rough patches left by the New Zealand bowlers' foot marks to take four wickets. Wagner and Boult were able to restore some respectability to the scorecard with a partnership of 52, including Boult hitting Swann for three consecutive sixes in one over. By the time New Zealand were all out, they had reached a total of 174 – still 180 runs behind, not enough to reach the follow-on target (the margin reduced to 150 runs due to the shortened match). However, despite his bowlers' dominance with ball in hand, England captain Alastair Cook elected not to enforce the follow-on and England came out to bat again, much to the surprise of some commentators.\nThe England openers were in stark contrast to one another as the innings began; as Cook reached his 30th Test half-century off just 63 balls, Compton was stranded on 7 runs for 22 balls before getting out off a bat-pad to part-time spinner Kane Williamson. After two centuries in a row in New Zealand, it was Compton's sixth consecutive Test innings in which he had failed to reach 20 runs. Cook (88*) and Trott (11*) then batted out the rest of the day to get England to 116/1 at the close. The pair continued on the morning of the fourth day, reaching a total of 134 for the second wicket (the biggest partnership of the series) before Cook was out caught to Williamson for 130 – his 25th Test hundred. Trott himself reached 76 before edging a wide ball from Wagner to a diving McCullum, and Root and Bairstow each added quarter-centuries en route to a declaration at 287/5.\nWith that, England's lead was set at 467, necessitating a record-breaking innings from New Zealand if they were to win the game. Realistically, with heavy weather expected on the final day, their only hope was to hold out for a draw. However, they still had the best part of five sessions to negotiate to do so, and the loss of Fulton (5) to Broad in the eighth over was not the best of starts. Swann then claimed the wickets of Williamson (3) and Rutherford (42) before the tea break. New Zealand lost three more before the end of the day; Brownlie (25) went first to Finn after a 79-run stand with Taylor, who made a valuable 70 before he and Guptill were dismissed by Swann as the day drew to a close with New Zealand still 309 behind on 158, with just four wickets in hand. The weather on the final day was as expected, with rain delaying the start by 45 minutes. It was only delaying the inevitable, however, as Broad caught McCullum off his own bowling in the third full over of the day, and Swann broke up a 56-run partnership between Southee and Bracewell, tempting Southee into an edge to slip for his 15th Test five-for before another bout of rain forced an early lunch. Swann got his 10th wicket of the match shortly after the resumption of play, dismissing Bracewell for 19, before Anderson wrapped up the victory and the series with the wicket of Boult for a 24-ball duck.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nEngland went into the 1st ODI missing two of their four-man bowling attack, with Stuart Broad (knee) and Finn (shin) ruled out through injury. Tim Bresnan and Jade Dernbach took their places in the side, Dernbach only having been called up to the squad the previous day as cover for Bresnan. New Zealand were also affected by injury, as Trent Boult was put out of action by a torn side muscle.\nNew Zealand won the toss and elected to field first, conditions tending to favour the bowlers early on. England started consistently, as openers Alastair Cook and Ian Bell put on 45 runs in the first 10 overs. However, the end of the first powerplay worked in New Zealand's favour, as two balls later, Bell was caught behind off the bowling of Tim Southee. Cook did not last much longer, falling to a similar ball for 30 runs. Jonathan Trott and Joe Root attempted to right the situation by adding another 67 runs for the third wicket as the innings passed its halfway point, only for Root to be bowled by Nathan McCullum attempting a reverse sweep on 30. McCullum then got Trott for 37 in his next over, before Eoin Morgan was caught out off a top-edged hook from Mitchell McClenaghan. After the loss of Jos Buttler for 14, Chris Woakes and Tim Bresnan provided valuable contributions of 36 and 25 respectively, before Graeme Swann added a quick-fire 15 off 14 balls, falling to the last ball of the innings with England on a modest 227/9.\nDespite the low target for New Zealand to chase, England got off to a perfect start with two wickets for James Anderson in the first over, both Luke Ronchi and Kane Williamson getting out for ducks. However, Martin Guptill was able to hold his end, and half-centuries from him and Ross Taylor meant a 120-run stand for the third wicket. Taylor managed to add just four more runs beyond his fifty before Anderson took his third wicket of the innings in the 26th over. Grant Elliott managed to survive an LBW appeal on 14 to go on to make a useful 27 before falling to Swann. The loss of captain Brendon McCullum for 5 shortly afterwards did nothing to stop New Zealand's march to victory, as a four from Guptill with the scores level brought up his century and gave the Black Caps the win with just over three overs to play.\n2nd ODI.\nEngland were again without Broad and Finn for the 2nd ODI, and so – despite adding former Ireland international Boyd Rankin to the squad – fielded the same 11 as in the 1st ODI. Meanwhile, New Zealand took the opportunity to rest Southee, bringing in Doug Bracewell in his place.\nNew Zealand won the toss and elected to bat, immediately demonstrating a reshuffling of their batting order, with Guptill facing the first ball from Anderson, presumably to protect Ronchi, who fell so quickly in the previous match. However, Ronchi was soon on strike and just as soon on his way back to the pavilion, Anderson clean-bowling him with the last ball of the third over. Guptill was almost out himself on 13 in the 10th over, but his low pull shot was dropped by Trott at midwicket. It was a mistake that would prove costly for England, as Guptill went on to put on successive 100-run stands for the second and third wickets with Williamson (55) and Taylor (60) on his way to a New Zealand record 189 not out off 155 balls. Captain Brendon McCullum put on 40 runs himself to close out New Zealand's 50 overs with the team on 359/3.\nEngland's response was reasonable, though they never looked like threatening New Zealand's massive total. Cook and Bell put on 50 runs together before Cook was bowled by Kyle Mills for 34 at the end of the eighth over, and Bell followed soon after for 25, caught by James Franklin off Bracewell. Root and Morgan both went for scores in the 20s, but the tail was found wanting as only Woakes (13) and Anderson (28) from the last six batsmen managed to reach double-figures. Trott made a valiant attempt to make up for his dropped catch off Guptill earlier in the day with an unbeaten 109 off 104 balls, but with wickets falling all around him, it was too big a task for him to manage by himself. England were eventually bowled out for 273 with just under six overs left, giving New Zealand an 86-run victory and an unassailable lead in the series.\n3rd ODI.\nWith the series decided and their first ICC Champions Trophy matches only a few days later, both England and New Zealand chose to reshuffle their sides for the final ODI. England dropped Dernbach and Woakes in favour of Ravi Bopara and James Tredwell, while Anderson and Swann were rested to make way for the returning Broad and Finn. New Zealand's changes were less pronounced, with Southee and Colin Munro coming in for Bracewell and Elliott, who had a tight calf muscle.\nNew Zealand won their third toss of the series and chose to put England in to bat. England started very slowly and the loss of Cook for a nine-ball duck in the third over did not help matters. However, his opening partner Bell was able to anchor the innings with a solid 82 off 96 balls, including half-century partnerships with Trott (37) and Root (33). Bell guided England from 3/1 to 153/3 before being tempted into a drive to mid-off by McClenaghan. The departure of Root and Bell in quick succession meant that both Bopara and Morgan were yet to score as the mandatory powerplay overs began; however, they both survived that five-over spell and went on to contribute vital runs to the total. With just over four overs to play, Bopara was caught out by Taylor for 28 while attempting to slog-sweep Williamson over deep midwicket. This brought Buttler to the crease for one of the most emphatic innings of recent history, scoring 47 runs off just 16 balls, including six fours and three sixes. Although Morgan was run out one short of his half-century, his quick-fire 62-run stand with Buttler meant that England closed out their 50 overs on 287/6.\nNew Zealand started their response quickly, but the reintroduction of Broad paid dividends for England when he got the wicket of Ronchi in the sixth over. It was Guptill who England had to watch out for, however, following his performances earlier in the series, but it was another newcomer to the England side, Tredwell, who put paid to the New Zealand opener's plans of going the entire series without getting out, bowling him with his fifth ball of the match for 38. Williamson (19) was next to go, trapped plumb LBW by Root for his first ODI wicket. Bresnan then got Munro for a golden duck, before Tredwell had McCullum caught behind for 6, and Franklin edged Broad to gully for 7. Taylor and Nathan McCullum managed to put on a 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket before Broad caught McCullum off the bowling of Bresnan. Three overs later, Finn had Southee for 15 and the contest was all but over; Taylor was still in, two runs away from his half-century, but with 92 runs still to get in 12 overs and only two wickets in hand, the task was too much for New Zealand. Taylor gave it his best shot, though, making it to 71 before holing out to Bresnan off the bowling of Tredwell, and Mills added 28 runs of his own, but McClenaghan was unable to hold his own end up for long and New Zealand were bowled out for 253, 35 runs from victory.\nICC Champions Trophy.\nFollowing the third ODI, proceedings were delayed by the Champions Trophy, in which New Zealand and England were both drawn in Group A alongside Australia and Sri Lanka. Following victory over Sri Lanka and a wash-out against Australia, New Zealand met England at Cardiff in their final match of the group stage. England won the match and qualified for the semi-finals, while New Zealand were eliminated after Sri Lanka beat Australia the following day. England then went on to reach the final, which they lost narrowly to India in a match reduced to 20 overs per side.\nT20I series.\n1st T20I.\nOnly five players from England's Champions Trophy squad were selected for the T20Is. Among the new names in the squad were Kevin Pietersen, returning to international cricket for the first time since March, Zimbabwe-born Gary Ballance, and Boyd Rankin, who had previously played for Ireland in both the ODI and T20I forms of the game. Only Rankin made the matchday XI, and he made an immediate impact. England won the toss and opted to field, and captain Eoin Morgan – standing in for Stuart Broad – handed Rankin the opening over. With only his fourth ball, Rankin bowled to James Franklin and found the inside edge through to wicket-keeper Jos Buttler. With New Zealand at 1/1 after just four balls, the pressure was on, but Hamish Rutherford (62) and captain Brendon McCullum (68) managed to salvage the innings with a 114-run stand for the second wicket. A mid-innings bowling spell from Luke Wright broke the partnership, Wright taking the wickets of both men in the space of four overs. However, Ross Taylor and Tom Latham put on another 39 runs in the last four overs to get New Zealand to a total of 201/4 at the end of their 20 overs.\nNo team had ever managed to chase down a T20I score of more than 200 in England, and it had only been done three times anywhere in the world. Michael Lumb and Alex Hales got them off to a good start, reaching 50 runs in just 3.3 overs; however, Lumb was out to the very next ball, bowled by Nathan McCullum. Hales was joined at the wicket by Luke Wright, and the pair put on another 55 runs for the second wicket, before Hales holed out to Franklin at mid-wicket for 39. Morgan was next to go, his 7 runs off 10 balls making him the only England batsman to score at a rate of less than a run a ball, and he was followed in the very next over by Wright. However, Wright's 52 off 34 balls left England needing 63 off the last five overs. An unbeaten 30 from Ravi Bopara, Buttler's quick-fire 17 and a six off the first ball of the final over from Ben Stokes got England to within five runs of the New Zealand total, but in the end it was too little, too late and the tourists took a 1–0 lead in the series."

When the centre opened in 1944, Guttmann was appointed its director and held the position until 1966. Sport was introduced as part of the total rehabilitation programme for patients at the centre, starting with darts, snooker, punchball, and skittles, followed by archery.\nGuttmann organised the first Stoke Mandeville Games for paraplegic persons in the form of an archery demonstration with two teams, which took place on 29 July 1948, the same day as the start of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Netball was then added as an event in 1949, and javelin throw in 1950. Snooker was first introduced into the Stoke Mandeville Games in 1951 and was included in every annual event up to 1959.\nGuttmann originally used the term \"Paraplegic Games\", a name that eventually developed into the \"Paralympic Games\" (or \"Paralympics\"), which were first held in Rome alongside the Summer Olympics in 1960.\nSnooker was included at the inaugural Summer Paralympics of 1960, held in Rome. The event took place outdoors in a covered area of a running track, on a table that was sent over from Stoke Mandeville Hospital. With the exception of 1980, snooker was then contested at each subsequent Summer Paralympics until 1988, a total of seven Paralympic Games.\nSnooker was only open to male competitors at the Paralympics. Over its Paralympic history, the event was dominated by Great Britain, who won eight gold medals in the sport, three of which were awarded to Nottinghamshire player Michael Shelton."

        "title": "National Rugby League salary cap",
        "text": "In 1990, the NSWRL introduced a salary cap system in an attempt to even the playing field of teams in the Winfield Cup. The National Rugby League has adopted the salary cap system from its predecessor. A special team headed by former Australian representative Ian Schubert deals with salary cap issues and monitors teams on a yearly basis.\nAs of 2019 the salary cap is $9.6 million for the top thirty players at each club. The minimum wage for each of those players for 2019 is $105,000. Total funding in 2018 by the NRL to the 16 clubs was $222.8 million, equivalent to $13.9 million per club. In 2010, following the Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal, the NRL introduced requirements for players and their agents to sign statutory declarations pledging their contracts comply with salary cap regulations, where previously only club chairmen and chief executives did so for biannual salary cap audits.\nSalary cap by season.\nNational Rugby League.\nSource:\nNRL Women's Premiership.\nSource:\nThe announcement also confirmed a rise in the salary cap from $350,000 in 2022 to $900,000 in 2023.\nDiscussion over the salary cap limit.\nThe NRL is one of the few major leagues to implement a salary cap in a sport that has competing leagues in other countries where there is either no salary cap or a much higher cap per club. As a result, there has developed a tradition of players from Australia moving to Europe where salaries for the elite, and even for average players, were considerably higher. The NRL chooses to continue with the cap, believing that any reduction in quality of the sporting product due to the loss of these players is less than allowing richer clubs to dominate. In practice, the goal of parity has been quite successful, with eleven different clubs winning the premiership in the 15 seasons between 1998 and 2015.\nIn 2008, the departure of Mark Gasnier and Sonny Bill Williams, two elite stars, to play French rugby union prompted calls for the cap to be raised. Australian rugby league players had suffered a 27% decline in their wages since 1999, whereas other Australian sportsmen had experienced steady, and in some cases explosive growth. Some of the blame has been apportioned to the fact that the media company News Limited was a 50% owner of the NRL, and would normally be expected to be a bidder for rugby league rights in Australia. Being an owner of the game meant News Limited could apportion rights to itself at a discount, reducing the overall income the league could make for itself through the sale of media rights. This had a flow-on effect reducing available income for players. Following the 2009–10 northern rugby union season, global exchange rate changes meant that payments in European currencies were not as attractive, and Gasnier returned to the NRL. Williams returned to his homeland of New Zealand in what proved a successful attempt to play rugby union with the All Blacks, and in 2013 returned to the NRL to play for the Sydney Roosters.\nThe new Australian Rugby League Commission secured a billion dollar television rights deal in August 2012, and both clubs and players expected a significant increase in the salary cap. Announcements that the cap for 2013 would increase from $4.4 million to only $5 million resulted in the Rugby League Players Association agitating for an increase to $6.5 million. The RLPA also expected increased retirement funds, income protection and a boost for representative payments.\nIn July 2013, NRL CEO Dave Smith floated the proposal of a marquee player allowance which could be paid outside the traditional salary cap to help retain the game's biggest stars such as Sydney Roosters Sonny Bill Williams - and help lure back the likes of ex-league player and Wallabies star Israel Folau.\nBreaches.\nThe breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the NRL are exceeding the salary cap, falling below the salary floor, not informing the NRL of payments, late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents relating to player financial and contract details or engaging in contract tampering. Trading cash for players is also prohibited to prevent wealthier clubs from evading the salary cap and salary floor regulations.\nPenalties for players, club officials and agents include fines of one and a half times the amount involved (until 2010, lesser of 10% of the amount involved or $100,000) and/or suspension. Penalties for clubs include fines of up to triple the amount involved (until 2010, the lesser of half the amount involved or $500,000), fines of $10,000 (until 2010, $2,500) for each document that is late or incorrectly lodged or lost, and/or deduction of premiership points. These penalties were increased after the Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal in 2010.\nThe following breaches of the salary cap and salary floor have occurred:\nNotable breaches.\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 2002.\nIn 2002, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs were fined the maximum of $500,000 and deducted all 37 premiership points received during the season after it was found that they had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap totaling $2.13 million over the past three years, including $750,000 in 2001 and $920,000 in 2002; these were described by NRL Chief Executive David Gallop as \"exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature\". \nThe points penalty meant that the club won the 2002 wooden spoon (South Sydney would have finished last if not for the breaches), and as the club had been leading the competition table prior to the imposition of the penalties, this was a shattering outcome for the club and its fans.\nNew Zealand Warriors 2005.\nIn 2005, the New Zealand Warriors were fined $430,000 and were ordered to start the 2006 season with a four premiership point deficit and cut their payroll by $450,000 after club officials revealed that their former management had exceeded the salary cap by $1.1 million over the last two years. The points penalty meant that the Warriors missed a finals berth in 2006.\nMelbourne Storm 2010.\nThe Melbourne Storm salary cap breach was a gross breach of salary cap over a period of five years. The NRL's discovery of these breaches in 2010 resulted in the Storm being fined a record $1.689 million, stripped of the 2007 and 2009 premierships, the 2006, 2007 and 2009 minor premierships and the 2010 World Club Challenge, and ordering them to play for zero points, effectively sentencing them to finish the 2010 NRL season (of which 75% was still to be played) with the wooden spoon.\nParramatta Eels 2016.\nThe Parramatta Eels were fined $1 million and stripped of their 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title after they were found to be over the salary cap by over $500,000. On 3 May they were stripped of the 12 NRL competition points they had earned up until then, and were not allowed to earn any further points until they fell back under the cap.\nManly-Warringah Sea Eagles 2018.\nIn 2018, Manly were fined $750,000 and two of the club's officials received 12 month bans after the NRL found that they had breached the salary cap over the previous five seasons. The breaches involve 15 players over five years, totalling $1.5 million. Unlike Parramatta and other teams who have breached the salary cap, Manly did not receive any competition points deduction.\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks 2019.\nIn February 2019, Cronulla were fined $750,000 for salary cap breaches dating back to 2013, although $500,000 of that was suspended due to the club self-reporting a discrepancy in 2017. It was reported that Cronulla were in breach of 3rd party payment rules between 2013 and 2017 but following an investigation by the NRLs Auditor the club's 2016 premiership victory was declared by the NRL as compliant.\nThe NRL first launched an investigation into alleged salary cap breaches back in 2017 when former Cronulla CEO Barry Russell self reported a $50,000 payment to forward Chris Heighington that was unearthed by former NRL salary cap auditor Jamie L’Oste-Brown shortly after he joined the club. The investigation found the then board members of the Sharks had set up a company in 2017 with the intention of attracting 3rd party sponsorships for players which breached the NRL's 3rd Party sponsorship rules due to its direct connection to the Sharks board.\nThe investigation also discovered that premiership winning coach Shane Flanagan had contravened the rules of his suspension by communicating with staff dating back to 2014. As a result, Flanagan was de-registered by the NRL."

        "text": "Glebe Rowing Club is the third-oldest rowing club in continuous operation on Sydney Harbour and was established in July 1879 in Blackwattle Bay Sydney, Australia. It has occupied its current location at the foot of Ferry St, Glebe since the club's inception. GRC is a community based club with a focus on novice, women's and social rowing and with a learn-to-row program.\nHistory.\nThe Glebe Club was founded with an open attitude in welcoming labourers as members unlike the other Sydney rowing clubs formed at that time – the Sydney Rowing Club and Mercantile. Glebe's first president was Sir George Wigram Allen, Speaker of the NSW Legislative Assembly and Glebe's first Mayor. Its first captain was Robert Clark, brother of Jim Clark, the Sydney's captain at that time. During the first ten years of the club's history it was the third most successful in Sydney winning 24 of the 260 races rowed between 1880 and 1890. In 1897 the shed at Blackwattle Bay and all the club's boats were destroyed by fire. A£570 insurance claim was made, a new shed opened only months later and a new fleet ordered. The club finished the last decade of the 19th century with 92 members and 11 boats.\nAt the end of the 1901/02 season, the club had 77 members and a fleet of 16 boats and had enjoyed some competitive success under club captain John McGregor. However, the club's decision to pay part of the capitation fees for its members of the New South Wales 1902 interstate crew caused considerable internal dissension, with a special meeting censuring the committee and several committee members then resigning.\nGlebe competed against the Iron Cove clubs for the Leichhardt Challenge Shield during the 1910s, claiming victory from the Leichhardt Rowing Club in 1918. That decade also saw the commencement of combined rowing and social outings. Glebe and the Mosman Rowing Club started the trend in 1915, with Enterprise and Balmain quickly following the example. Glebe held another event in 1916 the same year that Leichhardt, Balmain and the Enterprise club held a combined Rodd Island rendezvous.\nIn May 1953 for the second time in its history the club house was completely destroyed by fire and all boats were again lost. The club entered a hiatus until rebuilding commenced in 1957.\nDue to financial difficulties in the mid-1990s the GRC lost rights to its original shed. The upper floor was taken over by a restaurant and the shed by the Sydney University Women's Rowing Club. Olympian Kim Mackney was club's sole member from 1994 to 2004 and struggled to keep the club alive in that time. Eventually a new shed facility was secured immediately next to the Ferry Road boathouse.\nMembers.\nNotable members include:\nOlympic representative members include:\nWorld champions include:"

        "text": "The Volkswagen Golf (Mk7) is a C-segment car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Volkswagen. It is the seventh generation in the Golf series and the successor to the Golf Mk6. It was introduced in Berlin on 4 September 2012, before a public launch at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. Sales in Europe began with the model in November 2012.\nMarketed in three-door and five-door hatchback, van, and estate forms, the Golf Mk7 shares the MQB platform with the third generation Audi A3, SEAT León and Škoda Octavia.\nIn November 2016, Volkswagen presented a facelift of the Golf Mk7. It was replaced in December 2019 by the Golf Mk8, which is built on the MQB Evo platform. Production of the e-Golf and the Golf Variant ended in mid-2020.\nOverview.\nCompared with the previous generation, the Golf Mk7 has a more spacious cabin with greater shoulder room for the front and rear passengers, more rear legroom, and a larger boot space. It is wider than the Mk6, with a longer wheelbase.\nEngine options at launch include 1.2 and 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engines, with and respectively, and 1.6 and 2.0-litre diesel engines, with and respectively. The 1.6 TDI BlueMotion Concept has a theoretical combined fuel consumption of and anticipated 85 g/km emissions.\nAvailable body styles are three and five-door hatchbacks (including high-performance Golf GTI and Golf R models), and a five-door estate (known as the SportWagen in the United States, first advertised in May 2015). Sales of the three-door hatchback were not as strong as previous generations, and it was dropped with the launch of the eighth generation model in late 2019.\nA van version based on the three-door Golf was sold only in Ireland to commercial customers and was cancelled as corporations opted for the bigger Volkswagen Caddy.\nAt launch in the US market, Volkswagen also offered the Golf Sport model. Around 650 of these SE four-door models were built, equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission. Offered in either Pure White or Platinum Gray, the Sport model is visually enhanced with a body kit that includes a front lip spoiler, side skirts, a rear valence, a larger rear spoiler, and chrome exhaust tips.\nThe Golf went on sale in the UK in early January and was released in Australia in April 2013.\nIn Brazil, the Golf Mk7 went on sale in September 2013, only in the High-line and GTI trims, along with the Comfortline trim, which was made available from March 2014. All models were imported from Germany until 2015, when local assembly commenced.\nAt its introduction in 2013, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award, the first time it was awarded to a European product.\nSafety.\nEuro NCAP.\nThe Golf, in its standard European market configuration, received 5 stars from Euro NCAP in 2012.\nLatin NCAP.\nThe Golf, in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 7 airbags, received 5 stars for adult occupants and 5 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2014, and 5 stars for adult occupants and 5 stars for toddlers as well as the \"Advanced Award\" in 2017.\nIIHS.\nThe 2021 Golf was tested by the IIHS:\nEstate (Golf Variant, Golf SportWagen, and Golf Alltrack).\nThe estate/station wagon of the Golf was revealed at Geneva Motor Show in March 2013. It was marketed as the Golf Variant in Germany and Golf SportWagen in the United States and Canada, replacing the Jetta SportWagen nameplate previously used in the US.\nThe Golf Estate's load space volume was expanded from the 505 liters of its predecessor to 605 liters (loaded up to the back seat backrest), versus the 380 liters of the Golf hatchback. Loaded up to the front seat backrests and under the roof, the Golf Estate offered a cargo volume of 1,620 liters (versus the 1,495 liters of the Golf Estate Mk6). The rear seat backrests can be folded remotely via a release in the boot. Four petrol engines and three diesel engines were available, ranging from to for the standard petrol engines and to for the diesel engines. For the first time, the Golf Estate was also available as a \"full\" BlueMotion model, including revised aerodynamics. This model uses a 1.6-litre diesel engine producing 110 PS and a six-speed manual gearbox, and was expected to achieve a combined fuel consumption of 85.6 mpg (equivalent to 87 g/km of ).\nThe Golf R Estate used the same EA888 2.0L engine and all-wheel drive system found in the Golf R hatchback, along with the other features unique to the R.\nThe Golf Alltrack was introduced as a ruggedized version of the Golf Estate with slightly raised suspension, body cladding, a front skidplate, and all-wheel drive, among other minor mechanical changes.\nThe Golf SportWagen was available in S, SE, and GT/SEL (Trendline, Comfortline, and Highline in Canada) trim levels and used the same drivetrains as the standard Golf. The Golf Sportwagen was also available with all-wheel drive in the US and Canada beginning with the 2017 model year, using the 1.8L engine with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG transmission until its discontinuation in 2020. The AWD Sportwagen shared its drivetrain with the Alltrack, though it did not incorporate the other changes made for that submodel.\ne-Golf.\nThe production version of the 2014 Volkswagen e-Golf was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. On 14 February 2014, Volkswagen launched sales of the e-Golf in Germany. In Norway, the e-Golf became available for pre-order on 25 February 2014 for delivery in June 2014. On 11 March 2014, Volkswagen opened ordering for the e-Golf in the UK with deliveries began at the end of June. Production of vehicles destined for retail customers began in March 2014. U.S. sales started in selected states in November 2014 with a single SEL Premium model for the 2015 model year. Volkswagen stopped sales of the e-Golf in the UK in 2021.\nDrivetrain and specifications.\nAccording to VW, the e-Golf has a practical all-electric range of , with an official NEDC cycle of , reduced to in the winter. Under the EPA driving cycle used in the United States, the 2015 e-Golf has a range of , and combined city/highway efficiency of (miles per gallon gasoline equivalent). Real-world experience showed range varied between , depending on the weather and use of climate control, with an average efficiency of 3.7 mi/kWh over of driving, mostly within the city. A heat pump was available as an option to reduce the power consumed by the heater in cold weather.\nThe high-voltage traction battery has a storage capacity of 24.2 kWh, composed of 264 individual cells arranged in 27 modules of 6 or 12 cells each. It has a nominal voltage of 323 V. Overall weight of the entire vehicle, including driver, was , of which was the battery. Initially, the e-Golf was announced with a liquid-cooled battery in November 2013. However, the \"liquid-cooled\" description was removed from subsequent press releases in early 2014. Active thermal management for the battery pack was dropped because internal testing using Mk6 e-Golf prototypes showed high ambient temperatures did not affect battery performance. The smaller battery in the hybrid gasoline-electric GTE does use active thermal management, but that model is positioned as a hybrid version of the sporty GTI, rather than the e-Golf's equivalence as an electric version of the regular Golf Mk7.\nThe 2014–2016 model year e-Golf has a traction motor (designed EEM 85) and single-speed gearbox (EQ 270) with an output of / in \"Normal\" mode; using \"Eco\" and \"Eco+\" mode reduces power / torque output to / and / , respectively; both Eco and Eco+ disable the air conditioning system. In addition, four different levels of regenerative braking can be selected. The standard on-board AC charger has a maximum input power rating of 3.6 kW; as an option, DC fast charging using a Combined Charging System (CCS) connector is available, accepting DC power at a maximum rate of 40 kW. The DC fast charging option also upgrades the on-board AC charger to 7.2 kW.\nTop speed was electronically limited to . Externally, the e-Golf can be distinguished from its fossil fueled Mk7 counterparts with full LED headlamps and deletion of the exhaust outlet.\nUpgrades in 2017.\nThe 2017 version (Mk7.5) has an improved battery pack with a greater storage capacity of 35.8 kWh, giving a range of on the NEDC scale and an EPA rating of . In addition, the onboard charger was upgraded and accepts AC power at up to 7.2 kW as standard; DC fast charging (with CCS connector) was optional on the SE trim, and made standard for the SEL Premium and Limited Edition trims. Traction motor output also increased, to and , reducing acceleration time from 0 to to 9.6 seconds. Real-world testing indicated a full charge would provide a range of . For the 2020 model year, due to a change in the EPA testing procedure, the e-Golf was re-rated to a range and the combined efficiency rating dropped from .\nThe e-Golf was the last hatchback version of the Golf Mk7 produced in Europe, with production continuing until late December 2020 due to high demand, well after other powertrain variants which were discontinued in 2019. The successor ID.3 had been launched in 2019 and took over the e-Golf's Transparent Factory production line in Dresden, starting at the end of January 2021. In the United States, the production allotment of 2020 model year e-Golfs was diverted to Canada.\nIn China, domestic e-Golf production by the FAW-Volkswagen joint venture supplanted vehicles imported from Wolfsburg, starting in 2019. This helped VW meet the electric vehicle quota imposed by China: starting in 2019, manufacturers that sell more than 30,000 vehicles per year must ensure that ten percent of those are electric. Chinese production of the e-Golf by FAW-VW at the Foshan plant continued into 2021 with two models, the Golf·Pure Electric Motor and Golf·Pure Electric Motor Pro; the Foshan plant, which produced MQB platform vehicles from its opening in 2014, was retooled to add a MEB vehicle production line and the first ID.4 CROZZ vehicles began production at Foshan in late November 2020.\nSpektrum Program.\nFrom the 2017 to 2020 model years, Canadian-market e-Golfs could be optioned with one of 40 custom-order paint colors offered as part of Volkswagen's Spektrum program at a cost of roughly $3,000 CAD. A total of 104 e-Golfs were ordered with a Spektrum-program color.\nGolf GTE.\nThe Golf GTE plug-in hybrid is driven by two power sources: a 1.4-litre TSI direct-injection petrol engine and a 75 kW (102 hp) electric motor. Together, they combine to produce power of and of torque, with a theoretical range of . Using the electric motor alone, the GTE is capable of speeds of . With the TSI engine as well, the Golf GTE can accelerate from 0- in 7.6 seconds and on to a top speed of . The Golf GTE shares the basic powertrain hardware with the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron but the software controls are different. The Golf GTE also shares the same plug-in hybrid powertrain with the Volkswagen Passat GTE, but the Passat has a larger 9.9 kWh Li-ion battery pack.\nIn EV mode, the Golf GTE has an official all-electric range of but in real world testing will often get around to miles of range. Under the New European Driving Cycle, combined fuel economy is equivalent. The electric power can also be saved—for example when driving to a zero-emissions zone. The 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery can be charged in around three and a half hours from a domestic mains outlet, or two and a half hours from a domestic wallbox. The battery weighs , giving the GTE a total kerb weight of .\nThe car has 4 (or on some older models 5) driving modes. The car will always starts in all-electric mode (unless the battery has very low charge), a button beside the gear stick allows the driver to select between: Hybrid drive, Which allows the car to switch between electric drive and the petrol motor when driving. Charge Mode; which uses energy from the petrol engine to recharge the car's battery. Battery Hold Mode, which solely uses the petrol engine to save battery power (only available on older models) and back to Electric mode. The final option called 'GTE Mode' has a separate button beside the gear stick which allows the car to use both the petrol engine and the electric motor for a punchy performance.\nThe Golf GTE uses a six-speed DSG gearbox with a triple-clutch system specially developed for hybrid vehicles. The electric motor is integrated into the gearbox housing, while further hybrid components include power electronics and a charger. An electro-mechanical brake servo and an electric air conditioning compressor make for energy-efficient braking and air conditioning.\nInside as on the outside, the Golf GTE features blue highlights where the GTI has red. This includes stitching on the steering wheel, gear lever gaiter and seats, and a blue stripe in the tartan pattern on the sports seats. It includes bespoke functions for electric vehicles, including the ability to identify potential destinations on electric range, and electric charging points. The GTE will also feature an e-manager which allows the driver to preset vehicle charging as well as interior cooling or heating. These functions can also be operated remotely using the Volkswagen Car-Net app on a smartphone: a three-year subscription will be included in the UK.\nThe first GTE units were registered in Germany in August 2014, and it was the second-best selling plug-in hybrid in Europe in 2015 with 17,282 sales.\nGolf GTD.\nThe Golf Mk7 GTD is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged common rail diesel engine with . Maximum torque has risen from to from 1,750 rpm. The Golf R, in comparison, has from 1,800 rpm. Acceleration from 0- takes 7.5 seconds, while the top speed is . The GTD has a combined fuel consumption of , making for emissions of only 109 g/km. With the optional six-speed DSG, fuel consumption is and emissions of 119 g/km. For comparison, when the first generation Golf BlueMotion went on sale at the end of 2007, it had the same fuel economy and emissions.\nGolf GTI.\nThe Golf Mk7 GTI is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged direct-injection petrol engine (TSI) with . In the GTI Performance version, the engine's maximum power is boosted to . Both GTI models develop of torque. The standard GTI accelerates from 0 to 100  km/h in 6.5 seconds and can reach a top speed of 250  km/h. The GTI Performance has a top speed of 250  km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.4 seconds.\nBoth versions of the GTI are equipped with a start-stop system and fulfil 2014 Euro 6 emissions standards. With a six-speed manual gearbox, they attain the same low fuel consumption value of ( emissions of 139 g/km. This means that the latest Golf GTI offers an 18 percent improvement in fuel economy compared to the previous model. With the optional six-speed DSG gearbox, the two GTI models achieve fuel consumption figures of (equivalent to 148 g/km for the standard GTI and 149 g/km for the GTI Performance).\nBuyers who purchase the £980 Performance Pack not only gain 7 kW but also upgraded brakes and a limited-slip differential. The front differential is a new development, dubbed VAQ. This provides more neutral and agile driving behaviour and allows higher speeds to be carried through curves. The system consists of a multi-plate coupler between the differential cage and right driveshaft, which controls locking torque electro-hydraulically. Visually, vehicles with the Performance Pack are distinguished by 'GTI' lettering on the front brake caliper, larger vented brake discs front and rear (the same as fitted to the 'R' version), and red GTI badges on the front and rear although some cars still retained their silver badging despite being fitted with the Performance Pack.\nAs well as high performance, a high level of safety equipment comes standard in the Golf GTI. On top of high passive safety levels—thanks in part to a passenger cell made from high- and ultra-high strength steels—active safety features include the Automatic Post-Collision Braking system, which automatically applies the vehicle brakes after an accident to reduce the chances of a second impact; the pre-crash system, which tensions seatbelts and closes windows and the sunroof if an accident is likely to improve the effectiveness of the airbags; and seven airbags as standard, including one for the driver's knees.\nIn many markets including Mexico and South Africa, the GTI version is only available with the five-door body style, with no plans to introduce the three-door body.\nVolkswagen introduced a \"Rabbit Edition\" GTI for the 2019 model year. The Rabbit Edition featured a LED lighting package, a \"Vmax\" spoiler, 18-inch \"Pretoria\" alloy wheels painted in gloss black, and red tags embroidered with the VW Rabbit logo on the seat.\nVolkswagen's Mexican division introduced an \"Oettinger\" version for the GTI for the 2021 model year. The Oettinger version features an aerodynamic kit for the front fascia with lip and splitters, side skirts, a new rear bumper with integrated diffuser and a new spoiler with flaps, which stand out next to the version-specific 18-inch wheel set and black side mirrors. It is available in three colour options; Pure White, Tornado Red and Cornflower Blue. It will go on sale on 7 December 2020 and 700 units will only be built.\nGTI Clubsport (2016).\nVolkswagen introduced the special-edition GTI Clubsport for 2016, coinciding with the GTI's 40th anniversary. The Clubsport was not available in the United States. On the exterior, the Clubsport features a revised front fascia, more aggressive rear hatch spoiler, new rear diffuser with larger exhaust tips, and a black stripe along the lower sides of the body. Inside the car, the Clubsport is equipped with bucket seats and an Alcantara steering wheel and shift lever.\nThe Clubsport uses the same 2.0-litre \"EA888\" turbocharged inline-4 as the standard GTI which has been revised to produce 261 horsepower, with up to 286 horsepower for 10 seconds at a time via an included overboost feature which raises the engine's boost pressure by 0.2 bar, up to 2.1 bar. Transmission choices remain the same as the standard GTI, with both the 6-speed manual and 6-speed DSG available, both equipped with the standard GTI's optional limited-slip differential. Weight is listed as 1,375 kg. The Clubsport was available from the factory with optional Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The official 0-to-60 time is quoted as 5.9 seconds, 0.6 seconds quicker than the standard GTI with Performance Package.\nGTI Clubsport S.\nThe 3-door GTI Clubsport S was a limited-edition version of the GTI Clubsport sold as a higher-strung version optimized for faster track times. Only 400 were produced for the 2016 model year. Upgrades from the Clubsport to the Clubsport S include new front suspension and subframe components, updated suspension alignment, upgraded brakes, a more highly-strung version of the GTI's 2.0L EA888 turbocharged inline-4, using the larger IHI IS38 turbocharger instead of the IS20, that produces and of torque, standard Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 track-oriented tires, removal of the rear seats and some sound deadening, and a quoted weight of 2,998 pounds (1,360 kg).\nThe result of these modifications is a lap time of 7 minutes, 49.21 seconds around the Nürburgring Nordschleife track, 1.4 seconds faster than the Honda Civic Type R, which held the previous record for a front-wheel drive production car. The Clubsport S was released with an estimated base price of £35,000.\nGTI TCR (2019).\nIn January 2019, Volkswagen introduced new high-performance variation, the Golf GTI TCR with 290 PS 2-litre engine and special trim.\nGolf R.\nLike the GTI, the Golf R is also built as a three- or five-door hatchback. It is powered by a newly developed version of the turbocharged EA888 petrol FSI inline-four engine used in the latest Golf GTI, Audi S3, Volkswagen Tiguan and Jetta, and dozens of other Volkswagen AG vehicles, but in this application, it produces (or for \"hot climate\" markets such as Australia, South Africa, Japan, and the US) from 5,500 to 6,200 rpm and from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm of torque. Compared to the GTI's powerplant, the Golf R's engine has a modified cylinder head, exhaust valves, valve seats and springs, pistons, injection valves and larger intercooler and turbocharger. DSG-equipped models also come with an auxiliary oil cooler on the passenger side on right hand drive models.\n0-62 mph (100  km/h) takes 5.1 seconds (versus 5.7 seconds for the previous Golf R) or 4.9 seconds with the optional DSG gearbox. The top speed is electronically limited to. Despite this increased performance, a combined fuel consumption of , and emissions of 165 g/km and emissions of 159 g/km DSG) make the Golf R up to 18 percent more efficient than its predecessor.\nThe R uses an updated, fifth-generation Haldex 4MOTION four-wheel drive system. Under low loads or when coasting, the rear axle is decoupled, helping to reduce fuel consumption. Drive to the rear axle can be engaged in fractions of a second via the Haldex coupling, which is actuated by an electro-hydraulic pump. Up to 50 percent of power can be transferred to the rear axle. A brake-actuated XDS+ system mimics a limited-slip differential by applying the brakes to the wheel with the least traction, this is on both the front and rear axles.\nThe ride height is 20 mm lower than the standard Golf. Golf R models equipped with the optional 'DCC' (Dynamic Chassis Control) offer three suspension modes: 'Comfort', 'Normal', and 'Race'. Each mode adjusts the stiffness of the suspension damping, thereby offering drivers a way to change the way the vehicle responds with the push of a button. Comfort mode places the dampers in the softest setting, increasing the absorption of road imperfections and allowing for a smoother and more comfortable ride. Race mode stiffens the dampers to their most aggressive setting, reducing body movements and increasing adhesion to the road for more precise high-speed driving. Race mode also increases throttle response, firms up the steering for a heftier feel, and alters the shift pattern of the DSG gearbox (where fitted), and increases the speed of the Adaptive headlamps (AFS) response time.\nOn top of ESC Sport mode, as found on the GTI and GTD, which delays intervention of the electronic stability control system, the R offers the option fully to disengage the ESC, for track driving.\nFor the Canadian market, the optional Discover Pro 8\" infotainment system is available as part of the single option \"Technology Package,\" while only the 6.5\" Discover is available to US consumers. In North America, the Golf R comes standard with halogen tail lights and HID bi-xenon headlights with LED front and side view mirror turn signals, while ROW markets received the options for a sunroof, a three-door version, and LED tail lights. All these features are not available in the North American version. The Golf R and e-Golf are the only Golf models available in North America that was produced in Germany. Other Golf models for the North American market are produced by Volkswagen de México in Puebla, Mexico.\nA limited edition Golf R400 was rumored in August 2015 by Heinz-Jakob Neusser, then-head of brand development, but in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal (and Neusser's suspension) it was cancelled in favor of focusing on the Golf R.\nFor the South African market, the Golf R received another upgrade in power in March 2019. The upgrade resulted in and of torque (up from and in the facelift seen in July 2017). Additionally, the Golf R was also optionally available with an Akrapovič performance exhaust from the factory.\nThe Mk7 Golf R was discontinued in the United States in August 2019.\nSpektrum Program.\nFor the 2018 model year in Canada and 2019 model year in both Canada and the United States, Volkswagen offered 40 custom-order paint colors for the Golf R as part of their Spektrum Program. The program was initially introduced only for Canadian-market e-Golfs. Many of the colors offered were previously available on past Volkswagen Group models. The option carried a lead time of two to four months, as each car ordered as part of the Spektrum program was hand-painted in a separate facility from the main production line. Each custom-order color carried an MSRP in the United States of $2,500.\nA total of 473 Spektrum Golf Rs were produced, with 199 going to the United States, before the Mk7 Golf R's discontinuation in North America.\nFacelift.\nIn November 2016, Volkswagen revealed a facelifted version of the Golf Mk7. This model is referred to as the \"New Golf\" by Volkswagen, while it is often informally referred to as the Golf 7.5. A new engine was introduced along with the facelift: a 1.5-litre TSI which produces or . Initially, the existing 1.4-litre TSI was available alongside the new 1.5-litre engine. The updated Golf GTI was increased from to in the standard car and from to with the Performance Pack. The Golf R similarly had its output increased from to . In addition, the facelift increased infotainment screen size across the range, as well as adding the option for a fully digital dashboard. The rear lights now utilise LED technology as standard (including a \"sweeping\" indicator effect on performance models) while this technology is optional on most models for the headlights.\nThe facelifted Golf Mk7 was released in North America for the 2018 model year. The previous 1.8L EA888 engine was replaced by the 147 hp 1.4L EA211 engine as the only available powerplant, while the 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmissions were replaced by 6- and 8-speed units, respectively. The all-wheel drive Golf Sportwagen and Golf Alltrack models retained the 1.8L EA888 engine along with the 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG transmissions.\nPowertrain.\nThe Golf line is available in all the relevant drive systems: the Golf TSI, including GTI, is petrol-powered; Golf TDI, including GTD, is diesel-powered; the Golf TGI is powered by compressed natural gas (CNG); the e-Golf is powered by electricity; and Golf GTE is a plug-in hybrid. The use of a modular transverse matrix assembly kit enables the manufacturing of Golf models with gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid drives from bumper to bumper at Volkswagen factories. Retail deliveries of the e-Golf in Germany began in the second quarter of 2014. U.S. sales started in selected markets during the fourth quarter of 2014. The Golf GTE was launched also in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nAll internal combustion engines are three- or four-cylinder units:\nGolf Sportsvan/SV.\nThe Golf Sportsvan or Golf SV, is a five-door compact MPV which was designed and produced by the German automaker Volkswagen between 2014 and 2020. Previewed as the Volkswagen Sportsvan concept at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show and positioned below the seven-seater Touran in the company's product catalogue, it is derived from the Golf Mk7 and based on the MQB platform, and was also assembled at the Wolfsburg plant alongside the standard Golf hatchback. At 4,338 mm long, the new SV is 134 mm longer than the Golf Plus that it replaces, 83 mm longer than the Golf hatchback, and 224 mm shorter than the Golf Estate."

        "text": "Clubul Sportiv Municipal București, also known as CSM București, CSM or CSM Bucharest, is a professional women's handball team based in Bucharest, Romania, that competes in the Liga Naţională and the EHF Champions League. Founded in 2007, the club has traditionally worn a blue kit since inception. The team has played its home matches in the 5,300-capacity Polyvalent Hall in the Tineretului Park in southern Bucharest. CSM București established itself as a major force in both Romanian and European handball in the late 2010s, winning EHF Champions League in its debut season and reaching the Final Four three consecutive times. This success was replicated in the league, where the club won four consecutive times. The official CSM mascot is a \"tiger\". CSM Bucharest is one of the most widely supported handball clubs in Romania.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCSM București was formed in 2007 by the General Council of Bucharest, as part of the program to promote handball among capital's youth. The team played in the second division of Romania for two seasons without notable results. At the end of the 2008–2009 season, Rapid București experienced financial problems and eleven of their players along with coach Vasile Mărgulescu, moved to CSM. Benefiting from the experience of several new players, the club won all its Divizia A matches and promoted to the Liga Națională. Since 2010, CSM Bucharest were a constant presence of the Liga Națională, and finished third in their debut season, after Oltchim Vâlcea and Universitatea Cluj-Napoca. The team made European debut playing in the 2011–2012 season of the EHF Cup, where they reached the Round of 16 but unfortunately being eventually beaten by Romanian HC Zalău. In the following two seasons they played in the Liga Națională without significant results.\nFirst national title (2015).\nMărgulescu was fired after a poor start in 2014 and replaced with Mette Klit. The ambitious board aimed to win the Liga Națională next season, wanting to become even a threat to win the Champions League. In the spring of 2014, four Brazilian World Championship winners (Mayssa Pessoa, Ana Paula Rodrigues, Deonise Cavaleiro and Fernanda da Silva), plus 2014 European Championship's stars Carmen Martín and Linnea Torstenson, signed contracts at CSM. A strong squad was filled with local talent including Oana Manea, Iulia Curea or Talida Tolnai. The club hosted first edition of Bucharest Trophy in preseason. The hosts took the home advantage to win the final against Champions League Runners-Up ŽRK Budućnost. The Tigresses won their first eight matches of the season before losing to title rivals HCM Baia Mare. But at the second part of the season, CSM took revenge on Baia Mare with 29–23 win in Bucharest. They secured a spot in the playoffs and second place in the regular season. Eventually, they won 6 consecutive games, earning gold medal. CSM București beat HCM Baia Mare in both legs of the Championship Play Off Final. Previously they defeated HC Dunărea Brăila and Corona Braşov.\nEHF Champions League triumph and domination in Romania (2016–).\nBy winning the national title, CSM qualified automatically for the groups of the 2015–16 EHF Champions League edition. Once again, the club makes another number of top transfers including Isabelle Gulldén, Romanian legend Aurelia Brădeanu and Danish duo Line Jørgensen and Maria Fisker. Between 20 and 23 August, Bucharest hosted in preseason the second Bucharest Trophy event and grabbed a second consecutive title by defeating Corona Braşov, ŽRK Vardar and ŽRK Budućnost in the final. In September 2015, Mette Klit was replaced in CSM, her Danish fellow Kim Rasmussen taking over. Under Rasmussen, The Tigresses attained a milestone of 25 consecutive league victories. A second championship was won in April 2016. In 2016, CSM won the treble winning all the country titles, including the Cup and the Supercup (both against HCM Roman). CSM București made Champions League debut playing against ŽRK Budućnost, IK Sävehof and SPR Lublin SSA in the group stage. Four wins over the opponents from Sweden and Poland, as well the Montenegro draw, secured second place. Into the main round, CSM bothered by injury. Győri Audi ETO KC and ŽRK Vardar defeated CSM but the team reached the knockout phase where the Romanian side beat undefeated Rostov-Don twice in the quarterfinals. At the continent finals, in May 2016, București qualified for Final 4 finals for the first time after a semifinal victory over ŽRK Vardar, winning 27–21. On 8 May, CSM București won their title beating Győri Audi ETO KC in the final after a nail-biting penalty shootout. Playmaker Isabelle Gulldén scored 15 goals for CSM and finished as Europe's top scorer, whilst Aurelia Brădeanu scored the final spot-kick. Goalkeeper Jelena Grubišić was named Finals MVP. CSM regained the trophy for Romania after a 52-year break.\nPersonnel.\nCurrent technical staff.\n \n "

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich took place from 27 August to 2 September at the Olympic Reggatta Course in Oberschleißheim. There were 18 competitors from 18 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Yury Malyshev of the Soviet Union, the nation's fifth victory in the event; the Soviets returned to the top of the podium after having their four-Games (1952–1964) winning streak broken in 1968. Alberto Demiddi of Argentina took silver, the seventh man to win multiple medals in the single sculls (adding to his 1968 bronze). Wolfgang Güldenpfennig earned bronze, the first medal for East Germany as a separate team (East German rower Achim Hill had won two gold medals for the United Team of Germany in 1960 and 1964).\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nTwo of the 17 single scullers from the 1968 Games returned: bronze medalist (and 1964 fourth-place finisher) Alberto Demiddi of Argentina and sixth-place finisher Kenny Dwan of Great Britain. Demiddi was favored in Munich; along with his prior Olympic experience, he was the reigning (1970) World Champion, a two-time (1967 and 1971) Pan American champion, and the 1971 Diamond Challenge Sculls winner. \nBermuda, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Portugal each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its 14th appearance, most among nations, after missing only its second edition of the event in 1964.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used in 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960 as well as the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe winner of each of the three heats qualified for the semifinal round, while the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe top three finishers in each heat qualified for the semifinal round.\nSemifinals.\nThe first three in each semifinal heat qualified for Final A, with the remainder going to Final B."

Czechoslovakia (silver) and Romania (bronze) also won their first medals in the men's coxed pair.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nTwo of the 18 competitors from the 1968 coxed pair Final A returned: rower Wolfgang Gunkel and coxswain Klaus-Dieter Neubert from the fourth-place East German boat. They, along with new second rower Jörg Lucke (a 1968 coxless pairs Olympic champion), had won the 1971 European championship and were among the favorites. Another top team was the Czechoslovakian boat, brothers Oldřich Svojanovský and Pavel Svojanovský and cox Vladimír Petříček; they had won the 1969 European title. The Romanian crew, Ștefan Tudor, Petre Ceapura, and cox Ladislau Lovrenschi, were the reigning (1970) World Champions.\nCanada and Norway each made their debut in the event. France and the United States each made their 11th appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. This rowing competition consisted of three main rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals), as well as a repechage round that allowed teams that did not win their quarterfinal heats to advance to the semifinals.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top crew in each heat advanced to the semifinals, with all others sent to the repechages.\nRepechages.\nTop two finishers in each heat advanced to semi-finals.\nSemifinals.\nThe top three finishers in each heat advanced to Final A; others went to Final B."

        "text": "The South African cricket team toured Australia from 2 November to 3 December 2012. The tour consisted of three Test matches. The test series was preceded by one first class match between the South Africans and the Australian A squad. Michael Clarke became the first man to score four double-centuries in a calendar year, when he passed the 200-run mark in the first innings of the second Test in Adelaide. It was the last series played by former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who retired after the third Test.\nSouth Africa completed a 1-0 win over Australia after the first two tests were drawn, retaining their number one position in the ICC Test Match rankings.\nSquads.\nSouth Africa announced their squad on 10 October 2012 and dropped quick Lonwabo Tsotsobe for all-rounder Rory Kleinveldt. Australia announced a squad for the first test match at the Gabba on 28 October 2012. Brad Haddin was overlooked in favour of the younger Matthew Wade. In a Sheffield Shield match, Shane Watson injured his calf and was ruled out of the first test, and was replaced by Rob Quiney who made his test debut. Dean Elgar replaced JP Duminy after he was injured in the first test.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nMatch Report:\nTaking different approaches to the match, South Africa opted to leave spinner Imran Tahir out of the starting eleven, playing debutant fast bowler Rory Kleinveldt and going into the match without a frontline spinner; Australia omitted fourth pace bowler Mitchell Starc in favour of spinner Nathan Lyon. Australian batsman Rob Quiney made his Test debut, replacing Shane Watson who suffered a calf injury in the lead-up to the game.\nSouth Africa won the toss and elected to bat. After losing Graeme Smith early, South Africa batted strongly on Day 1, taking its score to 2/255 before bad light ended play. Alviro Petersen scored 64, and Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis were not out on 90 and 84 respectively at stumps.\nDuring a warm down activity after stumps, JP Duminy ruptured his left Achilles tendon, leaving him unable to participate in the rest of the match.\nDay 2 of the Test match was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. It was the first time since the that a whole day of test cricket had been abandoned in Australia, and the first time since 1983 that it had occurred in a Brisbane Test.\nResuming at 2/255, the partnership between Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis was reached 165 runs before Amla was dismissed for 104. Kallis (147) added a further 90 runs with Jacques Rudolph (40), before Kallis was dismissed with the score at 4/374. South Africa lost the rest of its wickets for 76 runs, and was all out for 450 shortly after tea. The wickets were shared amongst the Australian bowlers, James Pattinson taking the best figures of 3/93.\nMorne Morkel and Dale Steyn took early wickets to reduce Australia to 3/40 inside the first ten overs. Opener Ed Cowan and captain Michael Clarke then recovered to take Australia to 3/111 at stumps.\nAustralia dominated with the bat on Day 4. Ed Cowan and Michael Clarke batted together until shortly before the tea break, for a fourth wicket partnership of 259, and Cowan made his maiden Test century, before Cowan was dismissed for 136. Clarke and Mike Hussey then batted together through the evening session to take the total to 4/487 at stumps, with Clarke finishing 218*, to score his third double-century of the year. Altogether, Australia scored 376 runs on Day 4, and the only wicket to fall was to a run out.\nAustralia declared at 5/565 before lunch, with Michael Clarke on 259* and Mike Hussey out for 100, for a lead of 115 runs. South Africa reached 5/166, with Jacques Kallis (49) top scoring, and the match was drawn.\nThe man of the match award went to Michael Clarke for his unbeaten double century.\n2nd Test.\nMatch Report:\nAustralia won the toss and elected to bat. South Africa made a surprise change with Vernon Philander out with a sore back and Rory Kleinveldt replacing him. Shane Watson was unable to prove his fitness, which left Australia unchanged.\nSouth Africa took early wickets to reduce Australia to 3/55, before David Warner and Michael Clarke compiled a 155 run partnership. Warner scored his third test century before being dismissed for 119. Clarke and Mike Hussey then added 272 for the fifth wicket; Clarke finished the day on 224 not out, to become the first cricketer to score four double-centuries in a calendar year, and Hussey was dismissed for 103 on the final ball of the day. At stumps Australia was 5/482, the second highest score on the first day of a Test match. Jacques Kallis suffered an upper hamstring injury and could not bowl for the rest of the match.\nAustralia added 68 runs for its final five wickets on the morning of Day 2 to finish all out for 550, with Clarke dismissed for 230, and James Pattinson scoring a valuable 42. Morne Morkel took 5 wickets for 146 runs.\nIn reply, South Africa started well with a 138 run opening stand, before Alviro Petersen (54) was run out; Graeme Smith finished the day 111 not out, and South Africa were 2/217 at stumps.\nSouth Africa lost early wickets, including Graeme Smith (122), and collapsed to 7/250. Debutant Faf du Plessis (78) and Jacques Kallis (58) who was batting at No. 9 due to his injury, scored 93 runs for the eighth wicket, and South Africa finished all out for 388, a deficit of 162 runs.\nThe Australian openers scored 77 runs, before the South African pace attack took 5/26 late in the day. At stumps, Australia was 5/111, a lead of 273 runs.\nAustralia batted solidly through the morning of Day 4, taking the score to 8/267 before declaring midway through the afternoon session, setting a huge target of 430. Mike Hussey (54) top-scored for Australia. South Africa's was reduced to 4/45 shortly after tea, before AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis batted very defensively until the end of play. At stumps South Africa was 4/77, scoring at a rate of just 1.5 runs per over, and still needing 353 runs for victory.\nSouth Africa batted with an entirely defensive mindset on Day 5 to save the match, while Australia sought six wickets for victory. An injury to James Pattinson earlier in the match left Australia with only three front-line bowlers for the second innings. By the drinks break in the evening session, Australia had managed only two wickets – de Villiers (33) and Kallis (46) – to leave South Africa 6/233, and to leave du Plessis to bat out the final hour of play with the tail-enders. A fatigued Peter Siddle took two wickets in the final hour, for an innings total of 4/65, but South Africa held on to secure a draw. Du Plessis occupied the crease for a total of 376 deliveries, and scored his maiden Test century (110*) on debut. South Africa's final total was 8/248, scored in 148 overs at a very defensive run rate of 1.67.\nDu Plessis was named Man of the Match in his debut test, for his match-saving second innings 110* off 376 deliveries, as well as his first innings score of 78.\n3rd Test.\nMatch Report:\nIn the lead-up to the third Test, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting announced that he would retire at the end of series. Both countries made several changes to the teams which had finished the second Test three days earlier. For South Africa, debutant batsman Dean Elgar replaced Jacques Rudolph, fast bowler Vernon Philander replaced Rory Kleinveldt, and spinner Robin Peterson replaced Imran Tahir. For Australia, vice captain Shane Watson was back from injury and replaced Rob Quiney; fast bowlers Ben Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle were rested after heavy workloads in the second Test, and James Pattinson was injured; they were replaced by Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc and debutant John Hastings. This was the first time since 1885 that the Australian team changed its entire seam attack between Tests.\nSouth Africa won the toss and chose to bat. They reached 1/61 before losing two wickets just before lunch, and collapsed to 6/75 after lunch. There was resistance from Francois du Plessis (78 not out) and the tail, and South Africa was dismissed for 225 during the evening session. Australia faced 14 overs before stumps, and lost two early wickets. At stumps Australia was 2/33, trailing by 192 runs.\nSouth Africa made a strong start on Day 2, taking four Australian wickets inside the first hour to reduce Australia to 6/45. Matthew Wade (68) and John Hastings (32) provided resistance, and Australia was dismissed for 163 shortly before tea, a deficit of 62 runs. Dale Steyn (4/40) was South Africa's best bowler, taking three of his four wickets during Australia's first hour collapse. In reply, South Africa dominated the evening session, and at stumps had taken its score to 2/230 in only 38 overs, at a run rate of 6.05, and for an overall lead of 292. Graeme Smith (84) and Hashim Amla (99 not out at stumps) added 178 runs for the second wicket.\nHashim Amla scored his 18th century shortly after the start of play, and South Africa only lost one wicket in the morning session, that of Jacques Kallis (37). After lunch, South Africa completely dominated Australia with Amla (196) and AB de Villiers (169) both scoring big centuries. South Africa batted aggressively after tea, and was bowled out for 569, setting Australia a target of 632 runs to win. Mitchell Starc (6/154) took the first five-wicket haul of his Test career, and Mitchell Johnson took four wickets. The Australian openers survived fourteen overs before stumps and required 592 runs for victory at the end of the day.\nSouth Africa made another good start to the day by taking three wickets before lunch including the one of Ricky Ponting, who was dismissed for just 8 in his final test innings. Wickets continued to fall regularly through the day, and Australia was eventually dismissed for 322 during the evening session. Number ten batsman Mitchell Starc top-scored with 68*; Dale Steyn and Robin Peterson each took three wickets.\nThe Man of the Match award went to Hashim Amla for his second innings total of 196. The Man of the Series award went to Michael Clarke for his 576 runs in the series which included two double centuries."

He topped his own records by winning a fifth PBA National Championship title along with his fifth PBA Player of the Year award. When Anthony won the ARC Alameda Open early in the season, it gave him at least one PBA title for a 13th straight season, topping the old mark of 12 straight seasons with a title set by Don Johnson. At this same tournament, Anthony also became the first player in PBA history to top the $1 million mark in career PBA Tour earnings.\nDave Husted joined a growing list of bowlers who captured their first career PBA title at the BPAA U.S. Open. Mike Durbin was victorious for a second time in the Firestone Tournament of Champions, ten years after he had first won this event. \nNineteen-year-old Pete Weber, son of 26-time PBA titlist Dick Weber, won two titles in 1982.

        "text": "Dennis Lillee is a former Australian cricketer who took 24 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. A five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and fewer than 40 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A fast bowler who represented the Australian cricket team between 1971 and 1984, Lillee was described by one writer as \"the heart of Australia['s] bowling attack for more than a decade\" and was rated \"the outstanding fast bowler of his generation\" by the BBC. He was the first bowler to capture 350 Test wickets and held the record for almost two years before Ian Botham surpassed the feat. Lillee was named one of the \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 1973 and the \"South African Cricket\" (Annual) Cricketer of the Year three years later. The International Cricket Council (ICC) inducted him into its Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009.\nLillee made his Test debut during the sixth Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series where he claimed a five-wicket haul on debut. He was subsequently selected for the 1972 tour of England and took a pair of five-wicket hauls for the first time in a single match during the final Test of the same series. He ended the series with 31 wickets at an average of 17.67. He went on to claim five-wicket hauls in both innings of a Test match on three more occasions. Lillee's career-best figures for an innings were 7 wickets for 83 runs against the West Indies in 1981. He was most successful against England with eleven five-wicket hauls against them, and was most effective at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where he took seven of his twenty three five-wicket hauls. When Lillee retired from Test cricket in 1984, he had taken ten or more wickets in a match on seven occasions.\nLillee's One Day International (ODI) debut came against England in 1972. His sole five-wicket haul in ODIs came against Pakistan during the Prudential World Cup (1975) at Headingley. As of 2012, Lillee's combined tally of 24 five-wicket hauls is eleventh in the all-time list, a record jointly held with Sydney Barnes, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Dale Steyn.\nThis list includes only matches that are deemed official by the ICC. Lillee's performances in World Series Cricket and the World XI tour of Australia in 1971–72 are not included."

Former All Black David Evans helped persuade three Hawke's Bay clubs; Clive, Ahuriri and Kia Toa, to switch en masse to rugby league and form the basis of the first club competition. Mayor Vigor Brown ensured that rugby league had access to McLean Park. They were admitted to the New Zealand Rugby League that same year.\nIn 1989, after many years without regular access to local grounds, the Premier and Reserve club finals were both played at McLean Park. \nAmong those present were NZRL president George Rainey and chief executive Mike Knowles who with HBRL chairman Kel Lenord met with the Mayor of Napier and other city council personnel that day. It was as a result of the progress rugby league was starting to make again in Hawke's Bay, including access to the park, that the opening game of the 1990 Great Britain tour of New Zealand was played there, against a NZ President's X111.\nIn the mid-2000s the Hawkes Bay and Gisborne Tairawhiti Rugby League ran a combined club competition called the Eastern Alliance.\nRugby League Hawkes Bay celebrated its centenary in August 2011.

        "title": "Later cricket career of Jack Hobbs",
        "text": "Sir John Berry \"Jack\" Hobbs (16 December 1882 – 21 December 1963) was an English professional cricketer who played for Surrey from 1905 to 1934 and for England in 61 Test matches between 1908 and 1930. Having established himself as the best batsman in the world before the First World War, Hobbs resumed cricket in 1919 and was immediately successful in County Cricket. He successfully toured Australia with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1920–21 but sustained an injury which affected his batting on that tour and in the subsequent English season. Also in that 1921 season, he fell seriously ill with appendicitis; the effects of the illness and subsequent operation affected his batting for several seasons and his stamina never fully recovered. When he returned from the illness, Hobbs was a far less attacking batsman than he had been in his earlier career, but was much more secure and assured. As a result, his performances were statistically better than before 1914 and his reputation among the public grew. Adulation for Hobbs reached its peak in 1925 when he broke W. G. Grace's record for most first-class centuries, and the following season he made a century in extremely difficult batting conditions which was instrumental in England winning the Ashes. At this time, he also established extremely effective opening partnerships—with Herbert Sutcliffe for England and Andy Sandham for Surrey.\nHobbs continued to play Test matches until 1930; another assured performance on a rain-affected pitch in 1928–29 was followed by his final Test century. However, the last years of his career were affected by injury, and he missed a lot of cricket. He announced his retirement from Tests in 1930 but continued for Surrey until 1934 and took his total of centuries to 199—although two of these were not recognised as first-class during his career.\nCareer after the war.\nResumption of County Cricket.\nWhen first-class cricket resumed in 1919, county matches were reduced to two days in a short-lived experiment that many players, including Hobbs, disliked. Hobbs, awarded a five-year contract worth £400 per year, made runs in pre-season trial games and made a good start in first-class games. However, he initially tried to be too aggressive and, according to \"Wisden\", \"he had a brief spell of comparative failure, due to a little overeagerness and overconfidence\". After this, he batted consistently throughout the season, scoring a double century for Surrey against a touring Australian Imperial Forces cricket team, centuries in each of the three Gentlemen v Players matches—the only player ever to do so in one season—and 101 for the \"Rest of England\" against Yorkshire, the County Champions, at the end of the season. Hobbs' rescheduled benefit match, played against Kent, raised £1,670. The match ended when Hobbs and Jack Crawford scored the 95 runs required for victory in the final innings in 30 minutes; 45 minutes had been available and in most circumstances such a required rate of scoring made a draw almost inevitable. Hobbs scored 47 not out. All of the benefit money, supplemented by a £100 grant from Surrey, was given directly to Hobbs. Usually, the committee invested part of the sum on the player's behalf but they waived this practice for Hobbs. He used it to open a sports shop in London which he ran for the rest of his life. Also during the season, Hobbs first opened the batting with Andy Sandham, who succeeded to Hayward's position as Hobbs' partner. Sandham was initially unsuccessful, and Hobbs' partner later in the season was Donald Knight, but the pair later established an extremely effective opening partnership. In total that year, Hobbs scored 2,594 runs in first-class matches, more than anyone else, at an average of 60.32.\nAfter a winter working in his shop, Hobbs' good form continued into 1920, when county matches reverted to three days' duration. He scored a century in the opening game and 215 against Middlesex, the County Champions, at the end of the season. In June, he scored four centuries in consecutive innings, followed by 70 in the next. In total, he scored 2,827 runs at 58.89. Hobbs also took five wickets for 21 runs against Warwickshire, and his 17 wickets at an average of 11.82 meant that, according to his biographer John Arlott, \"to his amusement ... he was top, not only of Surrey's, but also of the national, bowling averages\". After some initial hesitation owing to his concerns for his business, Hobbs accepted an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC that winter.\nWhitewash in Australia.\nAustralia dominated the five-Test series, beating England 5–0. The England players, led by Johnny Douglas, faced a strong bowling attack, featuring pace bowlers Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald, and the spinner Arthur Mailey. In addition, the bowlers proved ineffective on hard pitches and struggled to dismiss a strong Australian batting line-up. After defeat in the second Test, Frederick Toone the MCC manager, suggested Douglas should be replaced as captain by Percy Fender. Hobbs supported such a move, but other professionals in the team were less certain. Although Fender was included in the team for the remainder of the series, Douglas retained the captaincy.\nHobbs began with two centuries in the opening three first-class games, and in the first Test, had the highest score in both England innings with 49 and 59. But Australia established their dominance in this match, winning by 377 runs after totalling 581 in their second innings. In this game, Hobbs had opened with C. A. G. Russell in place of Rhodes, who was out of form. For the remainder of the series, Rhodes was restored to partner Hobbs, but they could not replicate their former successes. In the third Test, their partnership was ended by a run out for the only time in Tests, and they had only one stand worth more than 50. Nevertheless, in the second Test Hobbs scored 122 on a very difficult pitch which had been affected by rain. \"Wisden\" commented that this was \"from the English point of view, the finest innings of the tour\". Even so, England followed on in reply to Australia's total of 499 and lost by an innings. Hobbs also scored a century in defeat in the third Test, hitting 123 in the final innings as England failed to score 489 to win the game. Hobbs did not pass 50 again in the series; in the fourth Test, he scored 27 and 13. Then in a match against New South Wales before the final Test, he tore a muscle in his thigh. Persuaded by Douglas to play despite suffering from restricted mobility, Hobbs scored 40 and 34 in the final Test. But after one incident in the field when he struggled to chase the ball, Hobbs was jeered by some of the crowd. Both Fender and another member of the team, Rockley Wilson, wrote scathingly about the incident in their dual role as journalists covering the Tests. Later in the match, the crowd, who gave Wilson a hostile reception following his writing, loudly cheered Hobbs; in Hobbs' view, this was to make amends for the earlier mockery of his hampered fielding. Hobbs scored a total of 924 first-class runs on the tour, at an average of 51.33; In Test matches, he scored 505 runs at 50.50. \"Wisden\" noted in its review of the tour that many English batsmen failed in the Test series, and that \"our batting on the big occasions fell far short of what might reasonably have been expected. Hobbs and Douglas alone were up to their form at home.\"\nIllness and recovery.\nHobbs played just five first-class matches in 1921. In his opening first-class game, Hobbs played for a team selected by businessman Lionel Robinson against the Australian touring team, which had travelled to England on the same boat as the returning MCC team. After scoring 85, he tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia and missed the remainder of the match. The injury forced Hobbs to miss the opening two Tests against Australia, but once recovered, he immediately scored 172 against Yorkshire; with England already trailing 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose him for the third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, Hobbs suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. However, the pain forced him to leave the field on the first day and after a day of rest, it worsened. A prominent surgeon, Sir Berkley Moynihan, was based in Leeds and Hobbs consulted him over the pain. Moynihan diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day; in the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. Hobbs missed the rest of the season, and upon recovering from surgery took a family holiday.\nHobbs returned to cricket in 1922 and batted very effectively throughout the first months of the season and scored 10 first-class centuries in total. One of the centuries came in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, in which Hobbs captained the Players team for the first time. But his innings of 140 was slow by his previous standards and he received some criticism in the press for his more laboured approach. Towards the end of the season, his form faded owing to the lingering effects of his illness and operation the previous year. \"Wisden\" observed that Hobbs frequently tired during longer innings in 1922 and that he often tried to get out soon after reaching three figures; this habit of giving up his innings continued throughout the remainder of his career. Hobbs himself believed that the operation reduced his stamina and that he was never as physically strong afterwards. The season also marked a turning point in his batting approach where he preferred to score more slowly and take fewer risks, in contrast to his adventurous pre-war tactics. Even so, Hobbs finished second in the national batting averages, and scored 2,552 runs at an average of 62.24, but declined an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. Hobbs was less successful in 1923 during a wet season; he failed with the bat on many occasions and was unsuccessful in both Gentlemen v Players games. He was still struggling with the after-effects of his operation and \"Wisden\" noticed he once more tried to score too quickly early in an innings. However, against Somerset, Hobbs scored the 100th century of his first-class career, the third man to reach the landmark after Grace and Hayward. Overall, he scored 2,087 runs at 37.95.\nPartnership with Sutcliffe.\nHobbs' form recovered in 1924 to the extent that Arlott described it as the beginning of \"his quite phenomenal second lease of cricketing life\". Batting conditions were good throughout the summer and Hobbs' opening partnership with Sandham for Surrey began to approach its peak of effectiveness. Having signed a new contract worth £440 per season, Hobbs began the season well and scored the seventh double-hundred of his career in a match against Nottinghamshire. More significantly for the future, Hobbs established an opening partnership with Herbert Sutcliffe. The pair had opened together in a festival match in 1922, in two Gentlemen v Players matches during 1923 and in a \"Test trial match\" played to assess potential members of the Test match team, also in 1923. The pair were chosen to open in another Test trial early in 1924, and the success of their partnership persuaded the selectors to include them in the team for the first Test against South Africa. When England batted first, Hobbs and Sutcliffe added 136 for the first wicket; Hobbs, playing a Test innings in England for the first time since 1912, scored 76. England won the match by a large margin. In the second Test, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 268 runs for the first wicket. Hobbs scored quickly throughout, increasing until he was dismissed for 211, his highest Test score. At the time, the innings was the highest played at Lord's in a Test and equalled the highest in a Test match in England. England scored 531 for the loss of two wickets and won the match by an innings. Amid a growing reputation, Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared 70 in the next Test, and Hobbs then scored 118 for the Players against the Gentlemen, although he faced more criticism for slow scoring.\nHobbs was left out of the team for the fourth Test; he had declined an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC in the coming winter, and the selectors wished to try players who might tour. Hobbs' official reason for refusing a place was his uncertain health. Part of the reason, though, was the MCC's position that the wives of professionals could not accompany a touring team; when Hobbs later accepted a place on a privately organised tour of South Africa, on which his wife would accompany him, the MCC and its treasurer, Lord Harris, agreed to change their rules and approached Hobbs again to offer him and his wife a place. He agreed to tour, but only as an extra player so that no other professional was deprived of his place. With the matter concluded, Hobbs returned to the England team for the fifth Test and scored 30. In the series, he scored 355 runs at an average of 71.00, while in all first-class matches he totalled 2,094 runs at 58.16. He finished second in the national averages, and the cricket press noted that, although Hobbs scored more slowly and in less spectacular fashion than previously, he batted in a safer, more secure style which was more successful in terms of run-scoring. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow also noted that Hobbs had transformed his technique to suit the modern style of batting with the batsman's weight on the back foot.\nFourth tour of Australia.\nThe MCC team which toured Australia in 1924–25 was captained by Arthur Gilligan. Australia won the Test series 4–1, but critics thought the winning margin flattered the host country and the English team were very popular. Much of the prestige of the team came from the batting partnership of Hobbs and Sutcliffe. Between them in the Test matches, they scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs. Hobbs was boosted by the presence of his wife and felt more relaxed than usual; she was also instrumental in his decision not to drink alcohol any more, taken on the outward journey.\nIn the opening first-class match of the tour, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the innings with a partnership of 89 in difficult batting conditions; Hobbs scored 50, and scored consistently in the other warm-up games. Amid great public interest, the Test series began at Sydney; in reply to Australia's first innings of 450, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 157 runs. Hobbs played the Australian bowling easily and he went on to his seventh century against Australia, beating the previous record in England-Australia Tests held by Victor Trumper. Hobbs subsequently lost concentration and looked uncomfortable until he was out for 115 and the remaining England batting failed. Australia eventually set England a target of 605 runs. Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared their second century opening partnership of the game, and Hobbs scored 57, but England lost by 193 runs. During the match, Hobbs became the leading run-scorer in Test cricket, passing the previous record of 3,412 runs set by Clem Hill in 1912. In the second Test, Australia scored 600 during the opening two days. In reply, Hobbs and Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day without being separated, scoring 283. They concentrated on defence and scoring quick singles, and both men reached centuries. The press praised their achievements, and there was speculation they might beat the opening partnership record set by Hobbs and Rhodes in 1912; meanwhile, the Australian team despaired of dismissing either man. In the event, Hobbs was dismissed by an accidental full toss from Arthur Mailey, having scored 154. Once more, the remaining batsmen failed and Australia won the game by 81 runs. In the aftermath of the defeat, Cecil Parkin, a former Test bowler and vocal critic of Gilligan's captaincy, wrote a newspaper article suggesting that Hobbs should assume the leadership of the side, albeit under the nominal captaincy of Percy Chapman. This suggestion provoked a reaction from Lord Hawke: \"Pray God, no professional will ever captain England\". This caused a press outcry, with some writers supporting the idea of Hobbs as captain; the professionals in the MCC team protested that Hawke had been \"disparaging\", a reaction the Australian press described as \"moderate and dignified\". In reality, Hobbs had no desire to captain England and did not like leading teams.\nAustralia once more batted first in the third Test, scoring 489; Hobbs bowled three overs owing to injuries to other bowlers. For tactical reasons, Hobbs did not open the batting and came in at number five. He shared a partnership of 90 with Sutcliffe, who batted at number six, and Hobbs went on to score 119 through cautious batting. Wet weather altered the course of the match and left England needing 375 to win. Hobbs and Sutcliffe, opening once more, began with 63 before Hobbs was dismissed for 27. The other batsmen played well but Australia won a narrow victory by 11 runs. The opening batsmen shared their fourth century partnership of the series in the fourth Test; Hobbs scored 66 out of a total of 548 and England won by an innings. But Australia won the final match to win the series 4–1 and in a heavy defeat, Hobbs failed in both innings. In the series, Hobbs scored 573 runs at an average of 63.66. Critics in Australia and England recognised him as the best batsman in the world.\nHobbs and Sutcliffe far outscored the remaining MCC batsmen and \"Wisden\" judged that with better support from other batsmen they may have won the series. The report in the almanack said: \"Finer and more consistent batting than that of Hobbs and Sutcliffe in the first four Test matches could not well be conceived ... Figures do not necessarily mean a great deal, but those of Hobbs and Sutcliffe are so remarkable, especially in view of the circumstances in which they were compiled, that they demand special mention.\" Hobbs did not play in any other matches once the Test series began but still scored 865 first-class runs at 54.06.\nPeak of popularity.\nRecord breaking season.\nBy the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the players famous. Hobbs was the biggest attraction and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around £780 each year), the income from his business, product endorsement and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached £1,500 a year by 1925, more than a family doctor at the time.\nIn contrast to previous seasons following an Australian tour, Hobbs was extremely successful in 1925. Early in the season, Hobbs scored three consecutive centuries at the Oval and the press began to speculate that he may soon pass the record of 126 first-class centuries held by Grace. He continued to score a string of hundreds in away matches and by mid-June had become the first man in the season to reach 1,000 first-class runs. Against Cambridge University, Hobbs hit centuries in both innings, and followed with centuries in his next two innings to give him four in succession. Hobbs played with great freedom during this spell, and after a brief lull in his run-scoring, hit 140 in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, playing a range of shots. His 12th century of the season, against Kent on 20 July, took him to 125 first-class centuries and one short of Grace's record. By now, the press and public were eagerly following Hobbs' progress in the expectation he would break the record, and great publicity surrounded his every move. Amid the pressure, and as fatigue set in, Hobbs lost form. Although he continued to make substantial scores, he could not reach a century; after one innings of 54, a newspaper headline proclaimed that \"Hobbs Fails Again\".\nFeeling considerable anxiety, Hobbs later wrote that he was tired of the publicity which surrounded the wait for him to score his 126th century. Finally, against Somerset on 15 August, Hobbs reached the landmark, scoring 101. Having made an unsteady start, he was 91 not out after the first day's play, and betrayed great nervousness in scoring the required nine runs the next day. The achievement was widely celebrated and Hobbs received many congratulatory telegrams. Then on the final day of the match, Hobbs scored another century to become the outright record holder. Over the following weeks, Hobbs was praised and feted throughout the country. He ended his season with 266 in a Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival, his highest to date and the best score made in the Gentlemen v Players series, and 104 for the Rest of England against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In total, he scored 16 centuries and totalled 3,024 runs at an average of 70.32, placing him on top of the national averages for the first time in his career. \"Wisden\" commented that \"Hobbs will go down to posterity as one of the greatest figures in cricket history\". Following the season, Hobbs gave speeches at several formal occasions, an obligation which terrified him, and several presentations in his honour. He also rejected offers to appear on stage, in film and to stand as a Liberal MP.\nAshes regained in 1926.\nHobbs was given a third benefit by the Surrey committee in 1926, with unusually generous financial guarantees given which reflected the county authorities' high opinion of him. The benefit eventually raised £2,670. Further recognition came when he, along with Wilfred Rhodes, joined the England selection committee for the season; for professional cricketers to serve as England selectors was unprecedented. The Australians toured that year and Arthur Carr was chosen to captain the England team, although Hobbs had some reservations over his leadership. Hobbs began the season well, scoring a century and several fifties in the lead-up to the Test series, although he received press criticism for the slowness of his batting in a Test trial. The first Test was badly affected by rain and there was little play. Hobbs remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University, sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham; this remains a Surrey first wicket record in 2012. Then in the second Test, Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182. Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for batting more slowly as his innings progressed, and some commentators accused him of selfishness—showing more concern for reaching a century than batting for the benefit of England. Although the bowling was very accurate, most critics believed Hobbs was too slow, and some suggested his approach deprived England of the opportunity to win the match; Australia batted throughout the third and final day to draw the game. The third Test was also drawn but presented difficulties for Carr and England. The composition of the team was criticised and Carr was not entirely happy with the team chosen; Hobbs accepted some responsibility for the decisions taken. Australia posted a large total and England, despite an opening partnership of 59 by Hobbs and Sutcliffe, followed on. This time the pair began with 156, Hobbs personally scored 88 and the game was saved.\nDuring the fourth Test, Hobbs assumed the captaincy when Carr withdrew from the match owing to illness after the first day. The selectors initially asked Herbert Strudwick to take over on the grounds of seniority but he declined so they turned to Hobbs. Although Hobbs expected Greville Stevens, the only amateur remaining in the team, to take over, he became the first professional to captain England at home. The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically as captain, although Carr did not approve. Hobbs scored 74 in England's innings, but heavy rain on the first day had ensured a fourth successive draw in the series.\nAs everything depended on the final game, the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed to a request that the match be played to a finish with time no object. The England selectors, conscious that the team had not beaten Australia in a series for 14 years, and had won just once in 19 Tests since 1920, made several changes. Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman, a decision which proved enormously controversial in the press but of which Hobbs approved; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest and excitement, the deciding match began; Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 53 on the first day, but after both sides had batted once, the match was evenly balanced at the end of the second day. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning; batting became extremely difficult, and few critics—including members of the England team—expected England to score many runs. Instead, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot sun drying a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on careful defence, but scoring where possible, the pair added 172 in total. Arthur Richardson, a spin bowler, was expected to be the main threat, but while it often looked like Hobbs would be dismissed, he faced most of Richardson's bowling and survived. Some critics believed that, through his batting, Hobbs had deliberately exaggerated the difficulties of facing Richardson to prevent the Australian captain putting on a more difficult bowler. Commentators praised the skilful defence of both batsmen, Hobbs in particular. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd. Many critics believed that, given the conditions, match situation and pressure, this was the greatest innings of Hobbs' career. England continued batting to build up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes.\nLate in the season, Hobbs made the highest score of his career, 316 not out for Surrey against Middlesex at Lord's, establishing a record individual innings for Lord's which survived until 1990. In total, Hobbs scored 2,949 runs at 77.60, including 12 centuries. This placed him at the head of the national batting averages.\nContinued dominance.\nHobbs missed a large part of the 1927 season; after beginning in good form, he missed five weeks of cricket with a skin infection. When he returned, he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players game, to his irritation as he believed he had been dropped owing to his age. He responded with a series of large scores, in which he played very aggressively, but then tore a thigh muscle. He resumed cricket at the end of the season and scored his sixth and seventh centuries of the year. He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, but his absences led to speculation that age was catching up with Hobbs. Hobbs began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks. When he recovered, he played in the last two of three Tests played against West Indies, playing in their first Test series. In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared another century partnership before Hobbs was out, playing casually, for 53. In the third Test, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe. England won both matches in which Hobbs played, and won the series 3–0; Learie Constantine, the West Indian bowler, was very impressed with Hobbs' batting, but Hobbs did not consider West Indies up to international standard and did not take the series very seriously. Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season. Even though many batsmen were successful that year, given very favourable batting pitches throughout the season, Hobbs finished second in the batting averages, scoring 2,542 runs at an average of 82.00 and hitting 12 centuries. Critics believed that he remained the best batsman in England.\nFinal tour to Australia.\nHobbs was eager to tour Australia in 1928–29; his wife again accompanied him and he wished to renew acquaintance with the many good friends he had previously made there. In addition, improvements in the design of ocean liners reduced his sea-sickness. Hobbs was part of the selection committee for the tour and critics recognised the MCC team as a strong one, particularly in batting. He began the tour with some substantial scores, although some critics noted that he did not bat well, but did not make a major contribution to England's large victory in the first Test. In the second Test, Hobbs scored 40 runs and was given a presentation to mark his 46th birthday which fell during the game. He was involved in controversy over the dismissal of Australian batsman Alan Kippax; the batsman had been initially given not out, but Hobbs let a prolonged appeal to the umpire and accused Kippax of cheating. Kippax was then ruled to be out, but there was some ill-feeling between the teams for a time, particularly towards Hobbs, who later apologised to Kippax for his language.\nEngland won the match, but some critics noticed a decline in Hobbs' batting, a judgement reinforced when he was out to a poorly-chosen shot in the first innings of the third Test for 20. Australia were able to build up a substantial lead, and overnight rain before the sixth day of the match made them likely winners according to most commentators. England were left needing 332 to win, but local observers believed that, on a pitch that was growing more and more difficult to bat on, a team would be unlikely to reach a total of 100. The ball bounced at varying heights and many of the England team regarded it as the most difficult pitch they had seen. Hobbs offered a catch when he had scored 3, but the ball was dropped. However, Hobbs and Sutcliffe survived to add 105 for the first wicket. Observers praised their technique against the turning ball; they exclusively batted using back-foot shots and only tried to score through the pull shot as other strokes presented too much risk. Even so, the Australian bowlers were criticised for their tactics. Hobbs was out for 49, an innings which Sutcliffe rated better than many centuries, and which Mason described as \"altogether disproportionate in importance to its unambitious dimensions\". At Hobbs' suggestion, Douglas Jardine came in to bat next, and England reached the end of the day having lost just one wicket for a score of 199. Next day, the team won the game to ensure they retained the Ashes, having a 3–0 lead in the series with two to play. Around this time, Hobbs began to openly talk about his retirement from Test matches, but after a century in a tour match, he scored 74 and shared a partnership of 143 with Sutcliffe as England won the fourth Test by 12 runs. In the final game, Hobbs, opening with Jardine as Sutcliffe was injured, scored 142 on the first day, his 12th and final Test century against Australia. Australia won the game, but lost the series 4–1. Hobbs and the press expected this to be his final Test match. In first-class games on the tour, he scored 962 runs at 56.58. and 451 runs at 50.11 in the Tests.\nEnd of Test career.\nHobbs suffered a succession of injuries and illnesses in 1929; over the previous few seasons, he missed more than a third of Surrey's matches. When he did play, he scored heavily and in total scored 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. He was unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa then chose to miss the next two, leading to speculation he had retired from Test cricket. However, he felt fit enough to play in the fifth and final Test, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years, when he tried to hit the ball further.\nPrior to the 1930 season, Hobbs made himself available for the forthcoming Ashes series. He began in good form, scoring centuries in each innings of his first game, and maintained his run-scoring in the weeks leading up to the first Test. Before the series began, Hobbs and Rhodes were added to the selection panel again. In the first Test, Hobbs scored 78 in the first innings, one of the few English successes. After England established a lead on first innings, he scored a rapid 74; he top-scored in both innings and was praised by the press for his continued success. England won the match and Hobbs seemed to have established his ascendancy over the Australian bowling attack, which critics regarded as weak. He failed in the next Test and suggested to the selectors that he should be omitted from the team. But he played in the third Test and was controversially dismissed for 29; his sportsmanship was called into question when he refused to accept the word of the fielder who held the catch. He lingered on the pitch and only left once the umpire ruled him out; he made his displeasure clear and the crowd became unsettled. When England followed on, in reply to an Australian total of 566, Hobbs appealed against the light and was jeered by the crowd. He was later run out for 13. Feeling tired, possibly feeling under pressure by his role as a selector and concerned by his form, he once more offered to stand down but the other selectors retained him in the team. When he batted in the fourth Test, he scored slowly, determined not to be dismissed, and shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe, their 11th century stand against Australia. After two hours batting, he was out for 31. With the series level at 1–1, the final match was to be played until there was a result, but before it began, Hobbs announced that it would be his last Test match. Shortly after making the decision, he returned to form, scoring a century and passing, in his next game, W. G. Grace's record aggregate of runs in a first-class career.\nBefore the deciding game, the selectors sacked Percy Chapman as captain. There was some press speculation that Hobbs would replace him, but Bob Wyatt was chosen. Hobbs supported the removal of Chapman, and there is a possibility that he was offered the captaincy at the meeting of selectors, but turned it down. In the match, Hobbs scored 47 in the first innings. When he came out to bat in the second, in the face of a large Australian first-innings lead, Hobbs was given an ovation by the crowd and the Australian fielders gave him three cheers. Hobbs was moved by his reception but scored only nine runs before he was dismissed. In 61 Tests, he scored 5,410 runs at an average of 56.94. He retired as the leading run-scorer in Test matches, a record he held until passed by Wally Hammond in 1937. In his final series, he scored 301 runs at 33.44. Hobbs maintained his form in other cricket until the end of the season, when he had scored 2,103 runs at 51.29, and \"Wisden\" noted that it was an achievement to score so well given his age. In September, he took a team of famous cricketers to Cambridge to play a charity match which included the official opening on Parker's Piece of the Jack Hobbs pavilion. However, an attempt by the \"Daily Herald\" to open a testimonial fund to mark his international retirement met with very little public interest, and the end of his Test career passed with little press comment.\nEnd of career.\nDuring the winter of 1930–31, Hobbs was invited to join a private team run by the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram which toured India and Ceylon. Sutcliffe joined him, and he was accompanied by his wife. Both Hobbs and Sutcliffe were extremely popular. In games which were not particularly competitive, he scored 593 runs, but these runs, and in particular the two centuries he scored were later to prove controversial. Hobbs never believed that the matches were, or should have been, first-class but statisticians later decided to recognise them as first-class. \"Wisden\" never recognised the centuries and so record his total of centuries as 197. Other authorities give 199 centuries.\nHobbs scored heavily in the 1931 season, although his batting technique had become more limited in scope and variety. He played several representative matches and took part in the 150th century opening partnership of his career. He was the first batsman in the season to reach 1,000 runs and such was his success that the press speculated he would return to the Test team. In festival matches at the end of the season, Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared two double-century opening partnerships. In total, Hobbs scored 2,418 first-class runs at 56.23. He continued to score well in 1932, although he missed several matches owing to injuries and fatigue. In total, he scored 1,764 runs at 56.90, including centuries in each innings against Essex. According to Mason, his performance against Essex caused Douglas Jardine to give him the nickname \"The Master\". Hobbs scored 161 not out for the Players against the Gentlemen. This was his 16th century in the fixture and beat the record number of centuries by Grace.\nHobbs was partially involved in the Bodyline controversy in Australia in 1932–33. Late in the 1932 season, Bill Bowes bowled consistently short against Hobbs in a match between Surrey and Yorkshire. Bowes was criticised in the press and particularly by Pelham Warner who was to manage the MCC team in Australia. Hobbs accompanied the team to Australia as a journalist, writing for the \"News Chronicle\" and the \"Star\", accompanied by his ghost writer Jack Ingham. During the tour, Hobbs neither condemned Bodyline nor fully described the English tactics. Other journalists admired Hobbs but dismissed his writing as \"bland\". Hobbs would not criticise Jardine, at the time his county captain and felt hampered by his lack of journalistic experience. However, his criticism of Sutcliffe's slow scoring in one innings provoked a reaction from Lord Hawke back in England, who attacked Hobbs in a public speech. Late in the tour, Hobbs played in one match for the touring team, scoring 44 in a minor matches when several players were rested or injured. When he returned to England, Hobbs openly criticised Bodyline bowling, in newspaper columns and in a book.\nIn 1933, Hobbs scored 1,105 runs at 61.38, aged 50. After missing the first games with illness, he scored 221 against the touring West Indian team, which earned many tributes in the press. He did not play every game, and the Surrey committee allowed him to choose which matches to play, and more centuries later in the season led to press anticipation of his 200th century—although the matches for Vizianagram's team were not counted as first-class at the time. By the end of the season, he had scored 196 first-class centuries. That winter he accompanied the MCC team in India as a journalist, and before the next season, Surrey had constructed a new entrance to the Oval which was named after Hobbs. After a solid start to the 1934 season, Hobbs scored his final first-class century against Lancashire. Afterwards, his form collapsed. Playing irregularly, his batting began to appear uncomfortable. His remaining innings were a struggle and both Hobbs and his team-mates realised that his career was over. In February 1935, he announced his retirement. In his final season, he scored 624 runs at 36.70. There were many tributes and a public dinner was held in his honour in 1935 which was attended by many leading figures in cricket. In all first-class cricket, Hobbs scored 61,760 runs at an average of 50.70 according to ESPNCricinfo."

The Barbarians won 9–6, and the match began a tradition for teams from the Southern Hemisphere to end tours of the British Isles with a match against the Barbarians.\nSummary.\nThe summary below is for all matches where test caps were awarded by both national unions, which leaves out all 24 meetings from 1920 to 1928, in which the governing New Zealand Rugby Union fielded the second level New Zealand XV team rather than the highest All Blacks team.

        "title": "Surfing in Australia",
        "text": "Australia is renowned as one of the world's premier surfing destinations. Surfing underpins an important part of the Australian coastal fabric. It forms part of a lifestyle in which millions participate and which millions more have an interest. Australian surfboard-makers have driven innovation in surfboard design and production since the mid-1960s. The country has launched corporate giants such as Billabong, Rip Curl and Quiksilver.\nNo surfing is possible in many parts of northern Australia due to coral reefs subduing waves. Modern surfboard design has been shaped by both Australian and Californian developments. For many years the sport was closely associated with the surf life saving movement in Australia.\nGoverning body.\nSurfing Australia is the national sporting body which guides and promotes the development of surfing.\nTournaments.\nMajor Australian tournaments include the Men's Samsung Galaxy Championship Tour, Quiksilver Pro Gold Coast (Gold Coast, Queensland), Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach (Bells Beach, Victoria) and the Drug Aware Margaret River Pro (Margaret River, Western Australia). Other tournaments include the Australian Boardriders Battle, Australian Open of Surfing, Beachley Classic, Breaka Burleigh Pro and the Noosa Festival of Surfing.\nHistory.\nSurfing was brought to Australia in 1915 by Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku. He demonstrated this ancient Hawaiian board riding technique at Freshwater (or Harbord) in Sydney, New South Wales. Kahanamoku's board is now on display in the northeast end of the Freshwater Surf lifesaving club, Sydney, Australia.\nIn the 1950s, surfing was so popular that the Australian government put laws in place in an attempt to curb surfing during working hours. The laws were removed after they resulted in more people surfing than usual.\nIn 1956, a team of lifeguards from the US introduced Malibu boards to Australia.\nIn the 1960s, Australian surfboard designer Bob McTavish invented the V-bottom surfboard, which is considered instrumental to the development of shortboard surfing.\nAustralia has produced multiple ASP world champions, such as Wayne Bartholomew, Tom Carroll, Barton Lynch, Damien Hardman, Mark Occhilupo, Mick Fanning, Joel Parkinson, Stephanie Gilmore, Layne Beachley, Wendy Botha, Pauline Menczer, Chelsea Georgeson, Sally Fitzgibbons and Mark Richards.\nThe World Surf League incorporates three major championship titles held in Australia: the Quiksilver Pro Gold Coast, Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach, and the Drug Aware Margaret River Pro.\nOne of the most successful Australian surfers, Mick Fanning, has won four titles at Bells Beach, earning him the number one spot in the surfing ranks.\nCulture.\nThe culture of surfing has grown dramatically from just being a relaxed way of living to a mainstream sport. The progression has led to research on the health benefits of surfing. The sport promotes cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength and balance. These physical benefits come from the constant paddling through the water, increasing arm and back strength whilst also increasing the heart rate. Surfing also gives one a chance to think and relax in an environment that decreases stress and relaxes the muscles.\nDemographics.\nThere are approximately 2.5 million recreational surfers in Australia, 420,000 annual surf participants, 107 surf schools and 2,292 accredited surfing coaches. Over 1 in 10 Australians surf as a recreational activity.\nAustralian World Title holders.\nMen\nWomen\nAustralian surfboard shapers.\nAustralia is a leading country in surfing and surf board design. Shaping is an important part of the innovation and progression of surfing. Australian shapers include Darren Handley who is shaper to world champions Mick Fanning and Stephanie Gilmore. Mark Richards (four times World Champion) is an Australian surfing and surfboard shaping legend who shaped his own boards during his time on the world tour."

The season started on 24 November 2012 in Gällivare, Sweden, and ended on 24 March 2013 in Falun, Sweden.\nThis season's biggest event was the Tour de Ski and the 2013 World Championships.\nPoints distribution.\nThe table shows the number of points won in the 2012–13 Cross-Country Skiing World Cup for men and women.\nEvery skier's results in all distance races and sprint races counts towards the overall World Cup totals.\nAll distance races, included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\nIn mass start races bonus points are awarded to the first 10 at each bonus station.\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\nAchievements.\n "

It is situated close to the Whitlawburn residential neighbourhood, and is adjacent to the A749 road between the southern edge of the Greater Glasgow urban area, and the town of East Kilbride located on higher ground further south; much of the course has panoramic views over the city.\nThe Club house was built as a dwelling house, just in case the new venture did not work out. The founders certainly had some vision, energy and only four years after the founding of the club they arranged an exhibition golf match which was held in June 1914. The legendary golfer Harry Vardon, 6 times Open champion played with George Duncan who also won the Open in 1920."

In that case, Igokea did not meet the required criteria, so Euroleague Basketball applied the 2012–13 Euroleague Bylaws, by which the 2013 ABA Final Four champion and the runner-up, would take the first two Adriatic positions in that order, whilst the next highest regular season team would take the final Adriatic position.\nC licenses and wild cards.\nVacant C license of Lokomotiv Kuban (2012–13 Eurocup champion), qualified with a B license, Asseco Prokom's lost A license, and the B license rejected by Acea Roma converted to a wild card:\nCompetition format changes.\nAs new, for this Euroleague season, the eliminated teams in the Regular Season, were dropped to the Eurocup.\nTeams.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round (TH: Euroleague title holders):\nQualifying rounds.\nThe eight teams participated in a single-venue tournament format, from October 1 until October 4, 2013.

Don McCune amassed six victories during the year, winning PBA Player of the Year honors along the way. McCune became known on tour this season for chemically softening his bowling balls to give them extra hooking power. The practice, which was completely legal at the time, was soon followed by several other bowlers in what would later be dubbed \"The Year of the Soaker\". This eventually led to new ABC and PBA rules related to altering bowling ball surfaces, while prompting bowling ball manufacturers to develop new, softer cover stocks.\nMike McGrath continued to come up big in big tournaments. His win in the BPAA U.S. Open gave him three majors among his first eight titles. McGrath would pick up his ninth and tenth titles later in the season.\nJim Godman became the first two-time winner in the Firestone Tournament of Champions, as he had also won the event in 1969. Earl Anthony captured his seventh PBA title and first major at the PBA National Championship."

The boxer with the most points at the end of the bouts wins. If a boxer is knocked to the ground and cannot get up before the referee counts to 10 then the bout is over and the opponent wins."

The competition began with a preliminary round on 9 August, where the number of competitors was reduced to 16, and concluded with a final on 13 August. As there were less than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers received a bye for the preliminary round. All bouts consisted of three periods where the boxers received points for every successful punch they land on their opponent's head or upper body. The boxer with the most points at the end of the bouts wins. If a boxer is knocked to the ground and cannot get up before the referee counts to 10 then the bout is over and the opponent wins.\nResults.\nJúlius Torma fractured his left hand during his second round bout against Cliff Blackburn, but was able to hide the injury in his remaining bouts, through careful defending and judicious use of his right hand."

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and fewer than 50 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Richard Hadlee, a retired New Zealand cricketer, took 41 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. A fast bowler who represented his country between 1973 and 1990, Hadlee was described by the BBC as \"one of the greatest bowlers the world has seen\". Hadlee was named by \"Wisden\" as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1982. In 2009, the International Cricket Council (ICC) inducted him into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Hadlee was the first bowler to take 400 wickets in Test cricket.\nHadlee made his Test debut in 1973 against Pakistan at the Basin Reserve, Wellington. His first Test five-wicket haul came in 1976, against India in a match at the same venue which New Zealand won. In February 1980, he took his first pair of five-wicket hauls in a single match against the West Indies at the Carisbrook, Dunedin. By the end of his career, he had claimed five-wicket hauls in both innings of a match on five occasions. He went on to take ten or more wickets in a match on nine occasions. In Tests, Hadlee was most successful against Australia, with fourteen five-wicket hauls. His best bowling figures in an innings were 9 wickets for 52 runs against the same team at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, in November 1985. He followed up in the second innings of that match with 6 for 71 and achieved his best match figures of 15 for 123 to give New Zealand an innings win.\nHaving made his One Day International (ODI) debut in February 1973 against Pakistan at the Lancaster Park, Christchurch, Hadlee's first ODI five-wicket haul came in 1980 against India, in a match at the WACA Ground, Perth, which New Zealand lost. His career-best bowling figures in ODI cricket were 5 wickets for 25 runs against Sri Lanka at the County Cricket Ground, Bristol, in June 1983. By the time he retired from international cricket in 1990 after nearly 17 years, Hadlee had taken 36 five-wicket hauls in Test cricket and five in ODIs. As of October 2012, he is second overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers, behind Muttiah Muralitharan."

The women's open-water marathon was held on August 15, and the men's open water race on August 16 in Fort Copacabana.\nOpen water quality.\nThe location for open-water events was a source of concern for athletes since scientists have found microbes in the waters off of Fort Copacabana and drug-resistant super bacteria off the beaches of Rio de Janeiro in 2014 and 2016 studies due to the daily dumping of hospital waste and household raw sewage into the rivers and ocean. Ten percent of the Copacabana water test samples contained drug-resistant super bacteria. However, during the races the water quality was good.\nEvents.\nSimilar to the program's format in 2012, swimming features a total of 34 events (17 each for men and women), including two 10 km open-water marathons. The following events were contested (all pool events are long course, and distances are in metres unless stated):\nSchedule.\nSimilar to previous Olympics since 2000, with the exception of 2008, the swimming program schedule occurred in two segments. For the pool events, prelims are held in the afternoon, followed by the semifinals and final in the evening and the night session (due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on May 7, 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games and is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC). The dates in the table are for August.\nQualification.\nFINA By-Law BL 9.3.6.4 (swimming) and BL 9.3.7.5.3 (open water) laid out the qualification procedures for the \"Swimming\" competition at the Olympics. Each country is allowed to enter up to two swimmers per individual event (provided they qualify), and one entry per relay; and a country may not have more than 26 males and 26 females (52 total) on its team.\nSwimming – individual events.\nOn January 15, 2015, FINA posted the qualifying times for individual events for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The time standards consisted of two types: an \"Olympic \"Qualifying\" Time\" (OQT) and an \"Olympic \"Selection\" time\" (OST). Each country was able to enter up to two swimmers per event, provided both swimmers met the (faster) \"qualifying\" time. A country was able to enter one swimmer per event that met the \"invitation\" standard. Any swimmer who met the \"qualifying\" time was entered in the event for the Games; a swimmer meeting the \"invitation\" standard was eligible for entry, and their entry was allotted/filled in by ranking.\nIf a country had had no swimmers who meet either qualifying standard, it may have entered one male and one female. A country that did not receive an allocation spot but had at least one swimmer who met a qualifying standard might have enter the swimmer with the highest ranking.\nSwimming – relay events.\nEach relay event features 16 teams, composed of:\nOpen-water swimming.\nThe men's and women's 10 km races at the 2016 Summer Olympics featured 25 swimmers:\nParticipation.\nParticipating nations.\nBrazil, as the host country, receives guaranteed quota place in case it would not qualify any qualification places.\nMedal summary.\nMen's events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals.\nWomen's events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals.\nOlympic and world records broken.\nWomen.\nLegend: r – First leg of relay"

The draw was seeded according to the result of the ranking round so the first seed shot against the 64th seed in the first round.\nEach match was scored using the Archery Olympic Round, consisting of the best-of-five sets, with three arrows per set. The winner of each set received two points, and if the scores in the set had tied then each archer would have received one point.

The competition had instituted several changes in the format and structure from the 2012 Summer Olympics. Twenty-four teams (twelve each for men and women) competed in the tournament.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe match schedule of the men's tournament was unveiled on 27 April 2016.\nFormat changes.\nOn 20 March 2014, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) instituted the changes to the match format, reducing from two 35-minute halves to four 15-minute quarters, with 2 minutes' rest after each period, and 15 at halftime. The purpose of the changes aims to improve the flow and intensity of the competition, and reinforce fan experience and opportunity for game presentation and analysis. Other changes include the implementation of 40-second time outs following both penalty corner awards and the scoring of a goal. Both interruptions and time outs must assure that the 60-minute game time is escalated for actual tournament and not depleted with a penalty corner set up, especially when the ball is not in play. Games ending in ties in knockout rounds are decided by penalty shootouts, as overtime was abolished in 2013.\nAccording to Leandro Negre, president of FIH, “The decision today demonstrates our commitment to fan engagement. With the additional breaks, fans will have the opportunity to enjoy more replays and be more engaged with the event, whether in the stadium or watching from afar, while hockey commentators will be allowed more time to provide sport analysis between plays. In addition, coaches and players will see improvement in their performance with the additional opportunities to re-hydrate and re-strategize.”\nQualification.\nMen's qualification.\nEach of the Continental Champions from five confederations received an automatic berth. Brazil, as the host nation, qualified automatically but with a rider: due to the relatively low standard of field hockey in Brazil, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) required Brazil to place higher than thirtieth in the FIH World Rankings by the end of 2014 or finish no worse than sixth at the 2015 Pan American Games in order to qualify as host nation. They achieved this by beating the United States on a penalty shoot-out in their quarterfinal, thus ensuring a top four finish.\nIn addition, the six highest placed teams at the Semifinals of the 2014–15 FIH Hockey World League not already qualified received the remaining berths in this tournament.\nWomen's qualification.\nEach of the continental champions from five confederations received an automatic berth. The host nation did not qualify as they failed to place higher than fortieth in the FIH World Rankings by the end of 2014 nor finished or seventh at the 2015 Pan American Games, failing to even qualify for that tournament: this restriction was decided between the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) due to the relatively low standard of field hockey in Brazil. In addition, the seven highest placed teams at the Semifinals of the 2014–15 FIH Hockey World League not already qualified received the remaining berths in this tournament.\nMen's competition.\nThe competition consisted of two stages; a group stage followed by a knockout stage.\nGroup stage.\nTeams were divided into two groups of six nations, playing every team in their group once.

Medals were awarded in three disciplines for both individual and team competitions.\nEvents.\nMedals were awarded in the following competitions:\nQualification.\nEach event had its own qualification rules, but generally rely on FEI rankings.\nDressage.\nFor the team competition, ten quota spots were available. Three team spots were awarded at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games. In addition, six more were awarded at regional competitions (Europe: 3, America: 1, Africa/Asia: 2). In addition, should a country had qualified 3 or 4 athletes in the individual competition, they also qualified as a team and were allowed to compete in the team competition.\nFor the individual competition, 60 spots were allocated as follows: 40 to the athletes who qualified from the teams above. In addition, the two highest ranked riders from each of seven geographic regions were qualified. The top six riders based on FEI ranking who did not qualify otherwise were given spots as well.\nJumping.\nA country might have sent up to four riders if it had qualified for the team competition. Similar to dressage, teams of four riders were qualified at either the World Equestrian Games (WEG) or through a regional competition. The WEG awarded five spots, the regions nine (Americas: two, Europe: four, Asia: two, Africa and the Middle East: one), and the hosts (Brazil). For the individual competition, a total of 75 spots was allocated as follows: 60 from the above teams the rest regional or through rankings.\nEventing.\nA country might have sent up to four riders if it had qualified for the team competition. Similar to dressage, teams of four riders were qualified at either the WEG, a regional competition, or through a composite spot. The WEG awarded six spots, the regions seven (America: one, Europe: two, Asia, Africa and Oceania: one), the hosts (Brazil). For the individual competition, a total of 65 spots was allocated as follows: 44 from the above teams, 7 through regional competitions and 14 through the world rankings.\nParticipating.\nParticipating nations.\n43 nations qualified. Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Palestine, Qatar and Zimbabwe made their Olympic debuts in equestrian events.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:\nCompetition format.\nShow jumping.\nFive rounds are ridden to determine individual medals. Riders placing first through 60th (including ties for 60th place) advance to the second round. The top 45 riders of round 2, including ties for 45th, advance to the third round. The top 35 riders of the third round progress to the 4th round, but only up to three riders per team (so if a country has four riders in the top 35, one of those is not allowed to compete for individual medals).\nIn the fourth round (individual final round A), the slate is wiped clean and all riders begin with zero faults. The top 20 riders in round 4 advance to round 5 (individual final round B), and ride another course. The faults for individual final round A and B and added together to determine individual medals.\nThe team competition completes three rounds to determine medals. It runs concurrently with the individual competition (riders running over the same course) so team riders are also competing for individual medals. The first round for team competition is the round 2 course for individual medals. The top eight teams from the first team round advance to the second team round (which is the same course as the individual round 3). The scores for these eight countries over team rounds 1 and 2 are combined, and medals are awarded based on those scores.\nDressage.\nTeams are made of up to four riders, all of whom are also competing concurrently for individual medals. Additionally, countries who can not make a full team may send riders to compete for individual medals.\nAll riders compete in the Grand Prix, which serves as the first round of both the individual and team medals. The top six teams (included those tied for 6th) advance to the Grand Prix Special, which is a slightly more rigorous test. The combined scores of the top three riders of those teams in both the Grand Prix and the Special determine the team medals, with the team with the highest score winning gold.\nRiders completing the Grand Prix test (first qualifying round of the individual competition) may move on to the Grand Prix Special (second qualifying round for the individual competition) if their team is in the top six (24 riders total). Additionally, the top 8 riders who do not qualify with a team may also advance to the Special to ride for individual medals. The top 18 riders from the Special move on to the third individual round, the freestyle. However, no more than three members on a team may advance. Each rider designs their own test for the freestyle, which must be set to music and has several compulsory movements. Riders can tailor a test to their horses' strengths, as well as incorporate movements that are more difficult than those required in the Grand Prix or the Special (such as a pirouette in piaffe) in order to increase their scores. As the slate is wiped clean after the first two rounds, individual medals are assigned based on scores in the freestyle.\nEventing.\nCompetitions for team and individual medals ran concurrently. Riders performed a dressage test, a cross-country round, and a jumping round. Team medals were then awarded by adding together the best three scores from a country's team, out of a maximum of five team members, from all three phases, the team with the lowest number of penalty points winning the gold. The top 25 individual scores after the first show jumping round performed a second, final, show jumping round to determine individual medals, with up to 3 riders in the individual running per team. Therefore, those competing for individual spots completed one dressage test and cross-country round, and two jumping rounds.\nMedal summary.\nThe 2016 event was marked by returning champions in the individual events, and new nations winning the team events. 2012 Individual eventing champion Michael Jung retained his title, as did 2012 Individual dressage gold medallist, Great Britain's Charlotte Dujardin on Valegro. In jumping, veteran Nick Skelton, part of the gold medal winning Great Britain jumping team from 2012, returned to take the individual title on Big Star, his 2012 gold winning horse.\nIn the team events, Germany displaced Great Britain from the top step of the Team Dressage podium, with the 2012 winners in silver, and the United States taking an unexpected bronze ahead of traditional powerhouse, the Netherlands. In Eventing and Jumping, France won the team gold medals.\nAs a result, Germany, Great Britain and France dominated the medal table with two golds each, Germany leading by dint of four minor medals to the one silver each for France and Great Britain."

However, in August 2013, the IOC stated that the cycling programme would be the same as in 2012.

        "text": "The boxing tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro took place from 6 to 21 August 2016 at the Pavilion 6 of Riocentro. However, boxing at the games was overshadowed with controversy after there were doubts raised that results in certain bouts had been manipulated. These concerns were upheld in a report published in 2021.\nCompetition format.\nOn March 23, 2013, the Amateur International Boxing Association instituted significant changes to the format. The World Series of Boxing, AIBA's pro team league which started in 2010, already enabled team members to retain 2012 Olympic eligibility. The newer AIBA Pro Boxing Tournament, consisting of pros who sign 5 year contracts with AIBA and compete on pro cards leading up to the tournament, also provides a pathway for new pros to retain their Olympic eligibility and retain ties with national committees. The elimination of headgear for male boxers and the adoption of the \"10-point must\" scoring system further clears the delineation between amateur and pro format.\nSimilar to 2012 format, men competed in the following ten events: \nAs for the women, they were eligible to compete in the following three events:\nQualifying criteria.\nEach National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to one athlete in each event. Six places (five men and one woman) were reserved for the host nation Brazil, while the remaining places were allocated to the Tripartite Invitation Commission. Because non-AIBA professional boxers were eligible to compete for the first time at the Olympics, a total of thirty-seven places had been reserved and thereby distributed to pros; twenty were qualified through the AIBA Pro Boxing Series with two for each event, while seventeen through the World Series of Boxing. Each continent had a quota of places to be filled through the two amateur and semi-pro league tournaments.\nQualification events were:\nCompetition schedule.\nThere were two sessions of competition on most days of the 2016 Olympics Boxing program, an afternoon session (A), starting at 11:00 , and an evening session (E), starting at 17:00 . Starting on August 17, days contained only one session, beginning at 14:00 .\nManipulated scorecards.\nA report published in 2021 into the judging at the Rio Olympics found that there were systemic attempts to change the outcome of certain bouts. It also found that the methods that were employed to exploit results had begun in the Olympic qualifying rounds. The boxing at Rio Olympics had been mired in controversy since they took place in 2016, in particular two results attracted attention (both involving Russian athletes being awarded dubious victories)\nThe AIBA would remove an unspecified number of judges and referees following the controversy, stating that they \"determined that less than a handful of the decisions were not at the level expected\" and \"that the concerned referees and judges will no longer officiate at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games\"; however, the original decision would still remain. Results were manipulated using a new judging system employed at Rio. Traditionally, judges would use a computer scoring system to count each punch landed but in 2016 the winner of each round was awarded 10 points and the loser a lower number, based on criteria which includes the quality of punches landed, effective aggression and tactical superiority. The new computer system took the scores of the five judges who judged the bout and supposedly a computer would randomly select three scores from those counted.\nIn 2019 the IOC stripped the AIBA of the right to organise the tournament at the 2020 Olympics, due to \"issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics and refereeing and judging\"."

Around 172 table tennis players (equally distributed between men and women) competed in both the singles and team events. Table tennis had appeared at the Summer Olympics on seven previous occasions beginning with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. In addition to men's and women's singles, the team events were staged for the third time since replacing doubles events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nQualification.\nAs the host nation, Brazil had automatically qualified six athletes; a team of three men and women with one each competing in the singles.\nThe top 22 male and top 22 female players on the International Table Tennis Federation's Olympic ranking list as of January 1, 2016 were qualified for the singles event at the Games. No nation could have more than two players per gender in the singles at these Games, so some players below the twenty-eighth position were given a qualifying place based on ranking.\nForty places were awarded to the table tennis players with a maximum of two per NOC and gender through the following continental qualification tournaments between July 1, 2015 and April 24, 2016: six each from Africa and Latin America, eleven each from Asia and Europe, and three each from North America and Oceania. One invitational place per gender was allocated by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).\nFor the team events, the highest-ranked NOC from each continent that already contained two qualified players for the singles added a quota place to form a team of three players and thereby secured a direct qualifying place for the Games based on the ITTF Olympic Team Ranking list. The remaining ten teams were allotted to the nine highest-ranked NOCs in any continent and to the host nation Brazil (if not qualified by any means) that have two players qualified for the singles.

Fourteen medal events were being contested by 547 athletes, 334 men and 213 women.\nFor the third Olympics in a row, Great Britain was the most successful nation, topping the medal table with three golds and two silvers. Germany and New Zealand finished equal in second place with two golds and one silver each.\nCompetition format.\nThere were eight events for men and six for women. Events included categories for open weight and restricted weight (lightweight) athletes, and two styles of rowing: sweep, where competitors each use a single oar, and sculling, where they used two.\nSculling events included men's and women's singles, doubles, lightweight doubles, and quads. Sweep events were men's and women's pairs and eights, and men's fours and lightweight fours.\nAlthough the size and composition of the 14 Olympic classes remained unchanged from the 2012 format, the number of boats for men had been reduced in the single sculls, quadruple sculls, and eight, spurring a change towards an increased proportion of boats for women in the single sculls, pair, double sculls, and lightweight double sculls.\nQualification.\nEach competing nation might qualify one boat for each of the fourteen events. The majority of the qualifying places were awarded based on the results at the 2015 World Rowing Championships, held at Lac d'Aiguebelette, France from August 30 to September 4, 2015. Places are awarded to National Olympic Committees, not to specific athletes, finishing in the top 9 in the single sculls (both men and women), top 5 in the eights, and top 11 in the pairs, doubles, and lightweight doubles, and (only for men) in the coxless four and lightweight four. In the quadruple sculls, the first eight nations will be qualified in the men's event, and the first five in the women's. Further berths were distributed to the nations (and in this case to specific competitors) at four continental qualifying regattas in Asia and Oceania (except for Australia and New Zealand), Africa, Latin America, and Europe (with the additional participation of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), and at a final Olympic qualification regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland.\nSchedule.\nAfter the first day of the competition, many rowers voiced their frustration about the rough conditions on the water. New Zealand rowers Emma Twigg and Mahé Drysdale talked about the regatta being about \"survival rather than skill\", and Rowing New Zealand lodged an official complaint with the organisers for not postponing the first day when conditions became \"unrowable\". With the water even more choppy at the start of the second day, that day's rowing was postponed."

The tournaments were won by Denmark in the men's competition and Russia for the women's tournament. The French teams for both competitions finished with the silver medal, and the bronze went to Germany and Norway, respectively.\nFormat.\nThe handball event at the 2016 Summer Olympics was played between 6 and 21 August 2016 at the Future Arena in the Barra Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Games consisted of two tournaments, one each for men and women's teams. The events featured twelve teams, who qualified for the tournament from a series of preceding tournaments, as well as the host country Brazil. The draw for the championships took place on 29 April 2016, and split the teams into round robin groups of six. Four teams from each group qualified for the knockout rounds, and the winner and runner-up receiving gold and silver medals respectively. A third-placed play-off was contested for the bronze medal.\nMatches were played over 60 minutes, with two points being awarded to winners and a single point to draws in the group stage. Teams tied for points in the group stage featured a series of tiebreaker criteria including head-to-head points, goal difference and goals scored.\nQualification.\nQualification for the Olympics were awarded based on a series of tournaments before the event between January 2015 and April 2016. Each National Olympic Committee were allowed to enter one team each for men and women. The host country was guaranteed an entry in each event, as was the winner of the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship. Four more spots were awarded to the winners of continental qualification tournaments for Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Finally, six places were awarded through three Olympic qualification tournaments. These tournaments were open to the top six teams from the World Championship that had not already qualified as well as six entrants determined through a complex continental qualification algorithm. The twelve teams were divided into three round-robin tournaments featuring four teams, with the top two teams in each tournament qualifying.\nSummary.\nMen's competition.\nThe semi-finals saw France defeat Germany by a single point, after having a three point lead at half time. The other semi-final between Poland and Denmark went to extra-time, with the scores tied at 25-25 where Denmark won the match 29-28. The bronze medal match was held between Poland and Germany. The Polish side started hotly and had a 8-5 lead, before the Germans came back and held a 17-13 lead at half-time. Germany pushed the lead to seven points after the third quarter, and eventually won the match 31-25 to win the bronze medal.\nThe Danish side met the French team in the final. Leading at 16-14 after the first half, Denmark retained their lead to win the match 28-26. This was Denmark's first medal in the handball event at the Olympics, having reached their best, a fourth place in 1984. Danish player Jannick Green \"dreamt about one day making\" the final, and the team \"worked really hard and played well\". The result put an end to the French period of dominance at the Olympics, having won the two prior events in 2008 and 2012. French player Luka Karabatic commented \"When you’ve got a medal around your neck it’s a little bit different and you can see what you achieved as a team...

The competition was played on a fast hardcourt surface used in numerous North American tournaments that aims to minimize disruption for players.\nInitially a total of 172 players were expected to compete in five events: singles and doubles for both men and women and the return of the mixed doubles for the second consecutive time. However, eventually 105 male and 94 female players were granted places in the draws. The Olympic tennis events were run and organized by the Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and were part of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tours.\nThe 2016 Olympic tournament was the fifteenth edition of tennis at the Olympics (excluding the two Olympics, 1968 and 1984, when tennis was a demonstration event), and the eighth since 1988, when the sport was officially brought back into the Games. Unlike previous editions of the Olympic event, it was decided that the Olympic tournaments would not offer ATP and WTA ranking points for the players.\nSummary.\nSerena Williams was the defending champion in the women's singles, but she lost to Elina Svitolina in the third round. Unseeded Puerto Rican Monica Puig won the gold medal, defeating Germany's world number two Angelique Kerber in the final, 6–4, 4–6, This marked Puerto Rico's first ever Olympic gold medal and made Puig her country's first ever female medalist.\nIn the men's singles, British flagbearer Andy Murray was the defending champion from the London tournament at Wimbledon, while Novak Djokovic was the number one seed and aiming to complete the Career Golden Slam. However, he was defeated in the first round by Argentina's Juan Martín del Potro. Murray defended his title, defeating del Potro in the final, 7–5, 4–6, 6–2, 7–5. With the victory, Murray became the first player, male or female, to win singles gold at two consecutive Olympics and the first player to defend an Olympic title since Serena and Venus Willams won the women's doubles title in Beijing and London. This, combined with a second Wimbledon title, becoming the first-ever three-time BBC Sports Personality of the Year and ending the year as the #1-ranked player by the ATP after having led Great Britain to their first Davis Cup since 1936 in 2015, contributed to his being knighted in the New Year's Honours List.\nSerena and Venus Williams were the two-time defending champions and number one seeds in the women's doubles, but they lost in the first round to Czech pairing Lucie Šafářová and Barbora Strýcová. The defeat ended the sisters' 15 match winning streak in women's doubles at the Olympics, and also marked their first loss together in Olympic competition. Russian duo Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina won the gold medal, defeating Timea Bacsinszky and Martina Hingis in the final, 6–4, 6–4. Martina Hingis had been attempting to become just the fifth woman to complete the Career Golden Slam in doubles.\nIn the men's doubles, Bob and Mike Bryan were the defending champions, but they withdrew before the competition as a result of health concerns. French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut were the number one seeds, but lost in the first round to Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah from Colombia. Spaniards Marc López and Rafael Nadal won the gold medal, defeating Romanian duo Florin Mergea and Horia Tecău in the final, 6–2, 3–6, 6–4.\nVictoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi were the defending champions in the mixed doubles tournament, but they were not able to defend their title as a result of Azarenka's withdrawal due to pregnancy. American pair Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock won the gold medal, defeating their compatriots Venus Williams and Rajeev Ram in the final, 6–7(3–7), 6–1, [10–7].\nQualification.\nFor the singles competitions, the top 56 players in the world rankings on 6 June 2016 of the WTA and ATP tours are qualified for the Olympics. However, entry has been limited to four players from a country. This means that players who are ranked in the top 56 but represent the NOCs with four higher-ranked players already participating do not qualify, allowing players who are ranked outside of the top 56 but from countries with fewer than four players already qualified to compete. Of the remaining eight slots, six of them will be determined by the ITF's Olympic Committee, taking into account ranking and spread of nations represented, while the final two slots are awarded by the IOC to players from small nations.\nIn the doubles competitions, 24 teams are automatically qualified for the Games based on the rankings to be published on 6 June 2016, subject to a maximum of two teams per NOC. Players in the top ten of the doubles rankings could reserve a place, provided they had a partner to compete with. Meanwhile, the remaining eight teams were decided by the ITF Olympic Committee.\nA player could only participate if he or she was available to be drafted to represent the player's country in Davis Cup or Fed Cup for two of the following years: 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, with one of the years being either 2015 or 2016.\nCompetition format.\nThe tennis competition at the Olympic Games consisted of a single elimination tournament. The size of the singles draw, 64, meant that there were six rounds of competition in total, with five in the doubles owing to its smaller draw size of 32, and 4 for mixed with its draw size only being 16. Players reaching the semifinal were assured of an opportunity to compete for a medal, with the two losing semifinalists contesting a bronze medal match.\nAll matches were the best of three sets, except for the men's singles final which was the best of five sets. The tie break operated in every set, including the final one (a first for the Olympics). In the mixed doubles the third set was played as a match tie-break (10 points).\nSingles seeds.\nMen's singles.\nThe following players received an ITF invitation:\nThe following players received a Tripartite Commission invitation:\nThe following players were originally in the entry list and supposed to be seeded but withdrew prior to the event:\nWomen's singles.\nThe following players received an ITF invitation:\nThe following players received a Tripartite Commission invitation:\nThe following players were originally in the entry list and supposed to be seeded but withdrew prior to the event:\nDoubles seeds.\nMen's doubles.\nThe following players received an ITF invitation:\nWomen's doubles.\nThe following players received an ITF invitation:"

It was his first major title, following four previous runner-up finishes. He became the first British man to win a singles major since Fred Perry in 1936, having been runner-up on four previous occasions. The final lasted 4 hours and 54 minutes, an Open Era record-equaling US Open final duration.\nThis tournament marked the last professional appearance of 2003 champion and former world No. 1 Andy Roddick. He lost to Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth round.\nThis tournament marked the first time since the 2004 French Open that neither Roger Federer nor Rafael Nadal (who withdrew from the tournament due to a knee injury) reached the semifinals of a major.\nReferences.\nMain Draw"
