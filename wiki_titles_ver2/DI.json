        "text": "Rugby league in New South Wales is the most popular spectator sport in the state, with the attendance and television audiences exceeding that of the various other codes of football. There are over 400,000 active rugby league participants, with a further 1 million playing the sport in schools, placing the sport second only to Soccer for the most played sport in the state. There is more than 500 active clubs, ten of which are professional teams competing in the National Rugby League (NRL).\nThe code in Australia began in Sydney in 1907 when the New South Wales Rugby League was formed as a professional competition, following the rules of the Northern Rugby Football Union in England. New South Wales remains the headquarters in Australia, with the Australian Rugby League based in Sydney. Sydney hosts the annual NRL Grand Final and has hosted the Rugby League World Cup twice.\nRugby league, along with touch football variant is played in most secondary schools throughout the state as well as at junior and club levels.\nThe premier state-level league is the New South Wales Cup, involving reserve teams for New South Wales sides in the NRL.\nThe New South Wales rugby league team plays against the Queensland rugby league team annually in the State of Origin series. Origin legends include: James Tedesco, Jarryd Hayne, Andrew Ettinghausen, Eric Grothe, Laurie Daley, Brad Fittler, Andrew Johns, Phil Gould, Bradley Clyde, Paul Sironen, Ben Kennedy, Glenn Lazarus, Paul Harrogan, Danny Buderus, Steve Roach, Boyd Cordner, Michael O'Connor and Brett Kenny. Clive Churchill, Bob Fulton, John Raper, Reg Gasnier, Graeme Langlands, Dally Messenger, Frank Burge and Dave Brown have been bestowed the title rugby league \"Immortals\".\nHistory.\nConducting its inaugural meeting in 1865, the now-defunct Sydney Football Club holds the honour of being Australia's first rugby club. The inaugural Sydney club competition was in 1874, competed by the Balmain Rugby Union Football Club, Newington College, Uni, and The King's School.\nArguments over the differences in the playing rules followed by each club or school led to the formation of the \"Southern Rugby Football Union\" (later renamed the New South Wales Rugby Union).\nBy the 1890s Rugby football had taken hold in New South Wales, thwarting attempts by Victorian rules and soccer to gain the ascendancy. The game continued to grow becoming the most popular code of football in NSW, until the issue of professionalism led to a schism in 1908 and the formation of the New South Wales Rugby Football League. The NSWRU lost many players including the great Dally Messenger to the new sport of rugby league, which became the most popular sport in the state by attendance and public interest by World War I.\nGoverning body.\nThe New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) is the governing body for rugby league in New South Wales and is a member of the Australian Rugby League.\nThe New South Wales Country Rugby League (NSWCRL) is the governing body for rugby league in areas of New South Wales outside the Sydney metropolitan area and for the Australian Capital Territory.\nNational Rugby League.\nThe National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia's top-level competition for the sport of rugby league.\nThe headquarters of the National Rugby League (NRL) is in Sydney. Greater Sydney is home to 9 of the 16 National Rugby League teams: the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, Parramatta Eels, Penrith Panthers, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Sydney Roosters, and Wests Tigers, as well as being the northern home of the St. George Illawarra Dragons, which is half-based in Wollongong. A tenth New South Welsh team, the Newcastle Knights, is based in Newcastle.\nEach team has 12 home games, with all of the fully Sydney-based clubs playing one game regionally. These games move venues every few seasons and are thus not included in the table below as they are non-permanent venues.\nMajor Competitions.\nFor information about the New South Rugby League Premierships run from the inception of rugby league in Australia until the ARL Premierships, see New South Wales Rugby League premiership\".\nThe NSWRL currently administers the following major competitions throughout NSW.\nNew South Wales Cup.\nThe Knock-on Effect NSW Cup is the state's premier men's open-age competition, directly feeding into the NRL.\nSydney Metropolitan Women's Rugby League.\nThe Sydney Metropolitan Women's Rugby League is a Women's rugby league football competition played in Sydney held by New South Wales Women's Rugby League\nRon Massey Cup.\nThe Ron Massey Cup is a semi-professional Rugby League competition – the second-tier competition for NSWRL Seniors – with clubs and players feeding into the Intrust Super Premiership NSW.\nSydney Shield.\nThe Sydney Shield is the NSWRL's fourth-tier men's competition, feeding into the Ron Massey Cup for both emerging and senior players.\nTertiary Student Rugby League.\nThe NSW Tertiary Student Rugby League is an affiliated body of the New South Wales Rugby League, established to promote the development of Rugby League within Universities, TAFE and other Tertiary Institutes within the state of NSW.\nJersey Flegg Cup.\nThe Jersey Flegg Cup is a senior rugby league competition played in New South Wales, played between teams made up of players aged under 20.\nS.G.

It was presented to each year's premiership winning rugby league team; the first to win three successive titles would take permanent ownership of the shield. The Eastern Suburbs club achieved this feat winning premierships in 1911, 1912 and 1913.\nThe hand crafted silver and oak designed shield was donated to the NSWRL by the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales in its first year of competition.\nLeading journalist Claude Corbett wrote in Sydney, Sun, newspaper on, 1 May 1914, \"The Royal Agricultural Society Shield, which was presented at the inception of the League's first grade competition has been won outright by Eastern Suburbs, who upset all calculations by winning the premiership three years in succession. The club has presented the shield to their captain, Dally Messenger, 'as a token of appreciation of his captaincy.\"\nIn 1929 Jersey Flegg was appointed to the position of president of the NSWRFL.\nJ.J. Giltinan Shield.\nIn 1951, the NSWRFL originated the J.J. Giltinan Shield, following his death in 1950. This trophy was awarded to the premiers of the NSWRFL competition, being named after one of the founding fathers of the NSWRFL and rugby league in Australia. The trophy remains today, being awarded to the minor premiers of the National Rugby League competition.\nFollowing Jersey Flegg's death in 1960, Bill Buckley was made the NSWRFL's new president.\nThe NSWRFL had also commenced a very popular and successful mid-week competition in 1974, originally known as the Amco Cup, but later as the Tooth Cup and the National Panasonic Cup. The success of this competition, which included teams from both Brisbane and New Zealand, ultimately created pressure for further expansion in the NSWRFL competition.\nIn 1980, the NSWRFL President Kevin Humphries, was instrumental in the establishment of the State of Origin series between teams representing the NSWRFL and Queensland Rugby League (QRL). The immediate success of this series, which remains the premier representative competition in Australia, and the overriding success of the Queensland team further pressured the NSWRFL to expand the club competition outside the boundaries of the state.\nSydney suburban teams came and went throughout the NSWRFL's history but it was not until 1982 that the competition included expansion outside of the Sydney area. This corresponded with the adoption of commercial sponsorship of the competition for the first time, the Winfield Cup. The two new inclusions were from the Australian Capital Territory – the Canberra Raiders – as well as a team from the southern New South Wales region – the Illawarra Steelers.\nWinfield Cup.\nThe magnificent Winfield Cup trophy remains a permanent symbol of one of the game's most successful eras. Cast in bronze by Alan Ingham, it was the game's ultimate prize for the duration of the Winfield sponsorship from 1982 to 1995.\nBased on John O’Gready's world famous photograph of Norm Provan (St George) and Arthur Summons (Wests) after the 1963 Grand Final, the trophy represented the premiership pinnacle for players in the Winfield Era. Its image of the big man and the little man encompasses many of the finer things about Rugby League – the mateship after battle, the satisfaction of the shared experience on the playing field – no matter how hard and tough the struggle has been, the message that Rugby League, for all its professionalism, is still a game.\nThe Winfield Cup captured these and many other enduring things about league in its primary image, \"The Gladiators\" and the famous trophy, like the JJ Giltinan Shield, remains an important part of the game's heritage.\nThe League's name was changed in 1984 to the New South Wales Rugby League and Ken Arthurson became the new chairman. In 1988, two Queensland teams joined the competition, with the inclusions of the Brisbane Broncos and the Gold Coast-Tweed Giants seeing the game move beyond the outer borders of New South Wales. At the same time a team from the Hunter region of New South Wales was included, with the return of a Newcastle franchise. Their return was the end of a 79-year wait in the wilderness and this time around the franchise was badged the Newcastle Knights.\nThe Winfield Cup competition was handed over to the control of the Australian Rugby League for the 1995 season, with the inclusion of teams from North Queensland, Western Australia and New Zealand. This period of expansion created tremendous success for the competition and rugby league in general. Over 3 million fans attended competition matches in the 1995 season and this figure remains the record for a single season attendance until this day.\nRepresentative.\nNSWRL manages the New South Wales State of Origin team as well the NSW Residents, Jim Beam Cup, under-19s, under-17s and under-16s and Indigenous rugby league teams. These teams traditionally play against teams from the Queensland Rugby League.\nCity vs Country is an annual match that takes place between a City side selected by the NSWRL and a Country side selected by New South Wales Country Rugby League. It is played before the Rugby League State of Origin series and is often referred to as a selection trial for the New South Wales Blues team.\nThe annual State of Origin series between the New South Wales Blues and the Queensland Maroons is the most popular sporting event in NSW. Sydney has hosted many State of Origin matches since the series began in 1980. The three-game series are held in Sydney and Brisbane with the first and third games in one city and the second in the other. These rotate every year, so if two games are played in Sydney one year, then those games are played in Brisbane the next."

        "text": "Jeffrey Charles Pierce (born June 7, 1969) is an American former middle relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played briefly for the Boston Red Sox during the season. Listed at , , he batted and threw right-handed.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nPierce was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, where his father, Don, was an engineer for IBM. Pierce grew up a fan of the New York Yankees and attended games at Yankee Stadium.\nHe played high school baseball for Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Hyde Park, New York, where he was teammates with Frank Cimorelli. In 1987, he had a batting average of .438.\nPierce did not receive any college baseball scholarship offers and was not drafted out of high school. Unable to afford college without a scholarship, he joined the United States Army Reserve. After completing Basic Training and spending the summer with the Army, he enrolled at Dutchess Community College in his native Dutchess County.\nAt Dutchess, he was talked into joining the baseball team where he was again teammates with Frank Cimorelli. In 1989, he was the National Junior College Athletic Association Region XV Player of the Year.\nHe continued his college baseball career for the NC State Wolfpack from 1990–1991. In 1990, he was named to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Second Team; he had a batting average of .359 with 13 home runs and had a 6–1 record as a pitcher.\nGiven Pierce's dual role as an outfielder and pitcher, coach Ray Tanner would sometimes toss a ball to Pierce in the outfield during mound visits so that he and teammate Brian Bark could use the time to warm each other up. During a game in May of his senior year in 1991, Pierce tied an ACC record by hitting four home runs and driving in ten runs. He was again named to the All-ACC Second Team as an outfielder in 1991. He was named to the ACC baseball tournament's All-Tournament Team as an outfielder in 1990 and 1991. In 67 games as a senior, he hit 19 home runs, drove in 77 runs and maintained a batting average of .370.\nProfessional career.\nChicago White Sox.\nAfter not being selected in the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, Pierce signed as a free agent with the Chicago White Sox on June 10, 1991. Though he primarily played the outfield at NC State, he was signed as a pitcher; Alex Cosmidis, the scout who signed Pierce, had seen him pitch a game in the 1991 ACC Baseball Tournament. However, he talked the White Sox into letting him take batting practice after signing and performed well enough that he was assigned to the Utica Blue Sox as an outfielder to start his professional baseball career.\nPierce spent the entire 1991 season as an outfielder in Utica where he finished fourth on the team in slugging percentage. Nonetheless, Pierce spent the 1991–92 offseason training as a pitcher in anticipation of being transferred to the pitching mound.\nPierce made his professional pitching debut in 1992 with the South Bend White Sox. At midseason, he was named a Midwest League All-Star. He finished the season with the second-most saves in the league.\nPierce began the 1993 season in Double-A with the Birmingham Barons. Despite missing two weeks in the summer due to a rib cage injury, he was third in the Southern League in saves by the end of July.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn July 31, 1993, he was traded along with Johnny Ruffin to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Tim Belcher. The Reds kept him in the Southern League with the Chattanooga Lookouts where he served primarily as a setup man for closer Chris Bushing, a transition he told the \"Birmingham Post-Herald\" he found \"pretty frustrating.\"\nPrior to the 1994 season, in the words of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\", Pierce was among a group of \"young, no-name pitchers\" invited to Major League spring training by the Reds. The Reds also thought highly enough of him to add him to their 40-man roster. However, in March, the team placed Pierce on waivers at least in part to create room on the roster for Tony Fernández. The Boston Red Sox signed him on March 18 to fill a spot on the 40-man roster created by their release of Scott Taylor. The next day, Pierce said he was \"glad to be out of the Reds organization\" because he \"wasn't too happy\" there. Peter Gammons later reported in \"The Boston Globe\" that Pierce had \"had some problems with teammates\" in the organization.\nBoston Red Sox.\nAt the conclusion of spring training, Pierce was assigned to the Double-A New Britain Red Sox to start the 1994 season. Despite pitching only a portion of the season in New Britain, Pierce led the team with ten saves, more than triple the second place finisher. On June 18, Pierce was called up to Triple-A for the first time in his career with the Pawtucket Red Sox; he became the 37th player rostered by Pawtucket in the 1994 season. Despite joining the PawSox mid-season, he finished the year with the fourth-most pitching appearances on the team. He had been expecting to receive a September call-up to the majors before the Major League Baseball Players' Association went on strike.\nThe Red Sox had high hopes for Pierce heading into the 1995 season. General Manager Dan Duquette told the press that he expected Pierce to have a middle relief role in the majors in 1995. He spent part of the offseason honing his craft in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico.\nPierce was named to Boston's Opening Day roster to start the 1995 season. He made his Major League debut on Opening Day, April 26, 1995; Pierce contributed to a two-hit shutout of the Minnesota Twins, pitching a scoreless eighth inning in the game at Fenway Park. Through his first ten appearances between April 26 and May 20, Pierce managed an ERA of 2.57, more than two runs better than the league average. However, in his next two games, he allowed ten of thirteen batters to reach base and surrendered seven earned runs in only one inning pitched. Around this time, Dan Shaughnessy wrote in \"The Boston Globe\" of the struggling Red Sox bullpen, \"On your scorecard they are known as Ken Ryan, Tim VanEgmond , Jeff Pierce, Stan Belinda, Alejandro Pena and Derek Lilliquist, but their real names are famine, pestilence, death, destruction, Steve Crawford and Wes Gardner.\" Nick Cafardo reported that Red Sox manager Kevin Kennedy was \"particularly peeved\" about Pierce's outing on May 24 against the Seattle Mariners in which Pierce allowed a three-run double to Mike Blowers. After the game, Kennedy publicly criticized Pierce's performance, telling reporters that his \"grandmother could have hit that\" pitch. Although Pierce responded by saying that he \"just went out and gave it 100 percent,\" he would not get another chance to pitch in the majors. The May 24 game would be the final appearance of his Major League career. A few days later, he and Ron Mahay were demoted to the minors to make room on the roster for Tim Wakefield, Tuffy Rhodes and Steve Rodriguez.\nFollowing the 1995 season, Pierce was designated for assignment and removed from Boston's 40-man roster in order to make room for Brent Cookson. During the offseason, he underwent surgery on bone spurs in his elbow which caused him to miss a large part of the beginning of the 1996 season. After the delayed start, he began his season at the bottom of the minor league ladder in the Gulf Coast League and worked his way back up to Triple-A Pawtucket by the end of July. Because of his surgery, his 51.1 innings pitched were a career-low since he began pitching in 1992.\nMercuries Tigers.\nOn April 4, 1997, the Red Sox released Pierce. After his release, Pierce chose to continue his career outside North America. He joined the Mercuries Tigers of the Chinese Professional Baseball League for two months at the start of the 1997 season. In only fifteen innings in Taiwan, Pierce allowed eleven earned runs, leaving him with the worst ERA on the team at the end of the season.\nChicago Cubs and retirement.\nOn June 20, 1997, the Chicago Cubs signed Pierce and assigned him to the Double-A Orlando Rays to replace pitcher Lee Hancock. Pierce made his debut with the team on June 21 and allowed one run over four innings. He said afterward \"I was very happy with the results... I just know I'm going to do better.\" However, the Cubs released Pierce less than a month later after having traded Frank Castillo to the Colorado Rockies for pitcher Matt Pool. Orlando Rays manager Dave Trembley said the organization decided to give his roster spot to Pool because he was the younger player. Pierce retired following his release.\nPierce told the \"Poughkeepsie Journal\" that he had no regrets about his career and would not be reconsidering retiring. He planned to finish his bachelor's degree, pursue a Master of Education, become a college baseball coach and live a \"normal life.\""

        "text": "William Eric Evans (27 February 1894 – 21 June 1955) was a Welsh rugby player and the secretary of the Welsh Rugby Union from 1948–1955.\nBorn in Neath in 1894, Evans left Wales to study at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He returned to Neath during his vacations where he played for the Neath Rugby Club. The outbreak of the First World War prevented Evans completing his university education and he was posted at Gallipoli. After the end of hostilities he returned to Cambridge and graduated in 1922. He returned to Wales and became English master and rugby coach of Cardiff High School. In 1923 he was one of the founding members of the Welsh Secondary Schools Rugby Union (WSSRU), to which the turn in fortune in Welsh rugby in the 1930s is attributed. He was a director of the Cardiff Arms Park Company and was a freeman of Haverfordwest.\nIn 1948 Evans would replace fellow Neath stalwart, Walter E. Rees, as secretary of the Welsh Rugby Union, after acting as honorary assistant secretary for the previous two years. Evans was a popular choice having been a member of the union for the last twenty one years and proving through his connections with the WSSRU his commitment to the advancement of the Welsh game. In his first season as secretary he brought clear administration and a sense of professionalism. During his first Christmas in charge he returned nearly a hundred gifts from various donors who were hoping for some consideration in the distribution of international tickets.\nIn 1955 Evans died while still in office; during his time as secretary he saw Wales win two Triple Crowns and the formation of the Welsh Youth Union in 1949."

Listed at 6' 5\", 215 lb., he batted and threw right-handed.\nPeña was a promising young pitcher in the Red Sox organization who had his baseball career shortened after suffering a serious injury. He posted a 2-0 record with a 0.69 ERA in two starts, giving up one run on nine hits and three walks while striking out 15 in 13 innings of work.\nIn spring training before the 2000 season, Peña was projected for the fifth starting rotation spot. He was 2-2 with a 1.64 ERA in 16⅔ innings, but was hit in the elbow by a line drive and then experienced pain in the elbow during a warmup. An exam confirmed a torn medial collateral ligament in his elbow that required surgery, causing him to miss the season. By 2002, Peña had worked his way back to Triple-A, but he went just 4-11 with a 5.33 ERA, after which the Red Sox let him go. He spent the 2003 season in the Toronto Blue Jays organization, then spent two seasons pitching in the independent leagues and the Mexican League before retiring in 2005 at the age of 28.

It was the 16th final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nThe match was Ross County's second appearance in the Scottish Challenge Cup Final since losing in 2004, whilst it was Clyde's first national final in 48 years since winning the Scottish Cup in 1958. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League, with both finalists coming from the First Division.\nRoddy Hunter scored first for Clyde in the 43rd minute with Andy Dowie equalising the score at 1–1 in the 80th minute for Ross County to force extra time. Clyde were reduced to 10 men during extra time after Eddie Malone was sent-off after receiving a second yellow card. The score remained 1–1 and the winner was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Both teams scored four of their first five penalties and Jason Crooks scored the winner for Ross County after Neil McGregor missed the decider for Clyde.\nTeam news.\nRoss County started with a 4-4-2 formation. Alex Williams, who was Clyde's top scorer the previous season, missed the match through injury along with Sean Higgins and Fergus Tiernan. Craig Samson started in goals for County, with on loan Celtic duo Gary Irvine and Michael Gardyne also getting starts. Gardyne was partnered by Frenchman Amick Ciani, the only non-Scot in both squads, in attack. Experienced duo Don Cowie and Derek Adams were partnered in the centre of midfield. The midfield was completed by youngsters Craig Gunn and Martin Scott. Midfielder Kevin McKinlay found himself in the unfamiliar position of left back, playing alongside Andy Dowie and Alex Keddie. Jason Crooks, who would go on to score the winning penalty, was making his first senior appearance from the bench.\nClyde used their preferred 3-5-2 formation. Star striker Dougie Imrie missed the game through injury, which he picked up in the previous game, as did Steven Masterton, who was suffering from a knee injury. Michael McGowan and Gary Arbuckle were both suspended, after picking up their second yellow cards of the competition at the semi-final stage. Goalkeeper David Hutton made only his fourth appearance for the club, with the consistent trio of Craig McKeown, Neil McGregor and Chris Higgins in front of him. The suspension to McGowan meant a rare start for Ryan McCann at right wing back, with Eddie Malone took up position on the opposite flank. Captain Paul McHale played in the middle of the park, alongside Craig Bryson and Stephen O'Donnell, with Andy Ferguson and Roddy Hunter forming the attack. The squad was so stretched that manager Joe Miller named himself amongst the substitutes."

        "title": "Table tennis racket",
        "text": "A table tennis racket is used by table tennis players. It is usually made from laminated wood covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the player's grip. Unlike a conventional \"racket\", it does not include strings strung across an open frame. Though the official ITTF term is \"racket\", the US generally uses the term \"paddle\", while Europe and Asia use the term \"bat\".\nRubber variations.\nTable tennis regulations approved by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) allow different surfaces on each side of the paddle for varying amount\nof spin (including nullifying it) or speed. For example, a player may have a spin-heavy rubber on one side of their paddle, and no spin on the other side. The player can flip the racket during play for different types of returns. To help a player distinguish between different types of rubber used by their opponent, regulations specify that one side of a paddle must be red, blue, violet, pink, or green while the other must be black, allowing a player to see what side of a paddle hits the ball mid-play. The player has the right to inspect their opponent's racket before a match to see the type and color. Current rules state that, unless damaged in play, the paddle cannot be exchanged for another at any time during a match.\nThe rubber coating may be of pimpled rubber, with the pimples outward, or it may be composed of a sponge layer, covered by rubber that may have the pimples pointed inwards or outwards. Some paddles are not covered with rubber (\"naked\") to make them spin-resistant. However, these are not approved for competition play by the ITTF. Some types of rubbers are also not approved. Approved rubbers have the ITTF emblem on the base of the rubber.\nAssembly.\nPlayers have many options and variations in rubber sheets on their racket. Although a racket may be purchased assembled with rubber by the manufacturer, most serious tournament players will use a custom racket. A player selects a blank blade (i.e., a racket without rubber) based on their playing style. The type of wood or synthetic layers used to make up the blade will determine the blade's speed. The different types of rubber sheets affect the level of spin, speed, and other specific playing characteristics. Racket construction and new rubber technology contribute significantly to the amount of deviation from the expected ball flight path.\nGlues and gluing.\nNormally, a sheet of rubber is glued to a blade using table tennis brand glues such as STIGA, Butterfly, Donic, or DHS. Some glues may work even if they are not designed specifically for table tennis rackets, such as rubber cement and tear mender. The rubber is not removed until it wears out or becomes damaged. In the 1980s, some players developed a new technique with a special glue called speed glue to apply the rubber every time they played. The glue would help provide more spin and speed by providing a \"catapult\" effect. Speed glue and all other compounds containing high VOC content were allowed for the last time in the 2008 Summer Olympics and are currently disallowed by ITTF regulations.\nMaintenance and protection.\nThe surface of a racket will develop a smooth glossy patina with use. The rubber surface needs regular cleaning to retain a high friction surface for ball spin. Commercial cleaners or water and soap can be cleaning agents.\n2021 bat colour rule change.\nPrior to 2021, the laws of table tennis specified that one side of the bat must be red and the other black. However, in 2021 the rules were officially amended so that blue, green, purple, or pink rubber could be used in place of the red one. Nevertheless, the other side must still be black."

        "text": "The 2007 Scottish Challenge Cup final was an association football match between Dunfermline Athletic and St Johnstone, held on 25 November 2007 at Dens Park in Dundee. It was the 17th final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nSt Johnstone progressed through four knock-out rounds to reach the final whilst Dunfermline Athletic contested only three after receiving a random bye into the second round. The 2007 final was Dunfermline's second appearance in a cup final in six months, having lost the 2007 Scottish Cup final, although it was the club's first Challenge Cup final. The match was St Johnstone's second appearance in the final of the tournament having lost in 1996. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League, with both clubs in the final coming from the First Division.\nSt Johnstone took a 3–0 lead within the first 30 minutes with a penalty kick from Paul Sheerin and goals from Peter MacDonald and Kenny Deuchar. Scott Wilson scored for Dunfermline after 37 minutes to make it 3–1 at half time. In the 70th minute, Stephen Glass scored from a penalty to make it 3–2. St Johnstone held on to win, and it was the first time the club had won a national cup trophy in its 123-year history.\nRoute to the final.\nThe competition was a knock-out tournament and in 2007 was contested by the 30 teams that played in the First, Second and Third Divisions of the Scottish Football League. The first round draw was split into two geographical regions with 15 teams in each: north/west and south/east. In each regional draw, teams were paired at random and the winner of each match progressed to the next round and the loser was eliminated. Dunfermline Athletic and Partick Thistle received random byes into the second round, at which stage the regional format ended and all remaining teams entered the same draw.\nDunfermline Athletic.\nDunfermline Athletic entered the second round after receiving a bye in the first round draw and faced the First Division club and previous season's runners-up, Clyde, at Broadwood Stadium. Mark Burchill scored first for Dunfermline in the 26th minute with Ruari MacLennan equalising for Clyde one minute into the second half. Owen Morrison scored Dunfermline's second goal after 57 minutes before he and Burchill both scored again to make it 4–1 and win the match.\nIn the quarter-finals Dunfermline faced Airdrie United, a competitor in the Second Division, away from home at the Excelsior Stadium. The score was goalless at half time but Burchill's two goals in the second half after 54 and 81 minutes respectively sealed a 2–0 win to progress to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament Dunfermline were drawn to play Ayr United, also of the Second Division, at home at East End Park. Similar to the previous round, the scoreline was 0–0 for most of the game before Glass scored a late winner for Dunfermline in the 83rd minute to win 1–0 and send Dunfermline into their first Challenge Cup final.\nSt Johnstone.\nSt Johnstone entered the north/east section of the first round draw and were paired with Second Division club Raith Rovers away from home at Stark's Park. Paul Sheerin scored the first goal of the game for St Johnstone in the 13th minute from a penalty kick. The scoreline remained that way until the 89th minute when Andy Tod scored a late equaliser for Raith Rovers to force extra time to be played. The score stayed 1–1 for the 30 minutes of extra time so the winner was decided by a penalty shoot-out, which St Johnstone won 5–4 to progress to the second round. In the second round St Johnstone faced the defending champions Ross County, also away from home, at Victoria Park. Kenny Deuchar scored the first goal for St Johnstone in the 14th minute before Andy Jackson scored the game's only other goal in the 49th minute to secure a 2–0 win and advance to the next round.\nSt Johnstone played another Second Division club, Brechin City, at home at McDiarmid Park in the quarter-finals, taking a four-goal lead in the first half: Kenny Deuchar scored twice and Andy Jackson and David Weatherston made it 4–0 shortly before half time. In the second half, Calum Smith pulled a goal back for Brechin City in the 57th minute to make it 4–1 which was how the score remained and St Johnstone progressed to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament, St Johnstone travelled to Cappielow to face fellow First Division club Greenock Morton. Both teams scored early in the match; Andy Jackson for St Johnstone in the 10th minute and Brian Graham for Greenock Morton two minutes later to make it 1–1. In the second half, St Johnstone scored two more goals from Peter MacDonald and Rocco Quinn to win 3–1 and advance to the final for the first time since losing in 1996 to Stranraer.\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nThe 2007 final was hosted at Dens Park in Dundee which had been Dundee F.C.'s home since it was opened in 1889. The match was the first time Dens Park hosted a national cup final since the Scottish League Cup in 1980. St Johnstone were allocated approximately 4,200 tickets and supporters occupied the Bob Shankly Stand and part of the Main Stand. Dunfermline fans were initially allocated the Bobby Cox Stand, the South Enclosure and the remainder of the Main Stand, but it was decided by the Scottish Football League to leave the South Enclosure unused after Dunfermline returned all tickets for the enclosure due to lack of ticket sales. Dunfermline Athletic travelled around to the venue whereas Perth-based St Johnstone travelled approximately .\nAnalysis.\nIn order to reach the final, Dunfermline played three matches; one at home at East End Park and two away from home. Dunfermline scored seven goals and conceded only one in the rounds before the final, keeping two clean sheets in the process.&lt;ref name=\"Soccerbase_2007/08\"&gt;Scottish League Challenge Cup 2007/08, \"soccerbase.com\", Retrieved 2 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; St Johnstone contested four matches before the final; one at home at McDiarmid Park and the other three away, scoring ten goals, conceding three and keeping only one clean sheet.\nBoth teams were competing in the Scottish First Division at the time of the final and despite being ranked at opposite ends of the league table, St Johnstone in third and Dunfermline in ninth, both teams were in relatively bad form. St Johnstone had drawn seven games from thirteen and were nine points behind second placed Dundee; whilst Dunfermline had won only three games in thirteen and were two points off the bottom of the table. The match was the first time the clubs had met in the Challenge Cup, however, they had already played each other twice in the season in the First Division; both matches ended in 0–0 draws.\nThree days before the final, St Johnstone's manager Owen Coyle was announced as the new manager of English Championship club Burnley, and so assistant manager Sandy Stewart was appointed as caretaker manager for the final; he accepted an offer to join Coyle at Burnley after the match.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nThe beginning of the match was dominated by St Johnstone and after 13 minutes they were awarded a penalty kick by referee Eddie Smith when Dunfermline midfielder Stephen Simmons collided with St Johnstone's Steven Anderson in the penalty area. Paul Sheerin took the penalty kick and scored beyond Dunfermline's goalkeeper, Paul Gallacher, by hitting the ball into the bottom-left corner of the goal to score his seventh penalty of the season. Just several minutes after the first goal St Johnstone had an opportunity to score again when Kenny Deuchar had an attempt on goal after a pass from Rocco Quinn; the header beat goalkeeper Gallacher but went just wide of the goalpost. In the 19th minute, however, St Johnstone did score their second goal when Peter MacDonald struck a left-footed volley from 12 yards out which Dunfermline's goalkeeper Gallacher failed to stop.\nSt Johnstone's early dominance coupled with Dunfermline's poor defending resulted in St Johnstone scoring a third goal after only 30 minutes; forward Andy Jackson passed the ball to Derek McInnes who then played the ball to Deuchar who moved past defender Sol Bamba in the penalty area and scored past the opposing goalkeeper from eight yards out to make it 3–0. Four minutes after the third goal, Dunfermline manager Stephen Kenny made the first substitution of the match, replacing defender Calum Woods with Darren Young. In the 37th minute, shortly after the substitution, Dunfermline scored when Scott Wilson's header beat St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Main.\nSecond half.\nOnly 40 seconds into the second half, Quinn almost restored St Johnstone's 3-goal advantage but his attempt on goal rebounded off the goalpost despite beating the goalkeeper. In the 59th minute, Dunfermline defender Danny Murphy was the first player to be cautioned by the referee, receiving a yellow card for bringing Quinn to the ground whilst tackling for the ball. In the 64th minute, Dunfermline made their second substitution; Michael McGlinchey was replaced by Jim Hamilton and he had an almost immediate impact on the match, earning a penalty kick after being pushed by Anderson. Referee Smith initially awarded a free kick on the edge of the penalty area but changed his mind amid complaints from Dunfermline players and awarded a penalty kick instead. Stephen Glass took the penalty kick, hitting the ball past goalkeeper Main into the top corner of the goal to make the score 3–2. Dunfermline continued to pressure for an equalising goal and almost did so when St Johnstone defender Goran Stanić nearly scored an own goal after mis-hitting the ball but it rebounded off the crossbar. Despite Dunfermline's late improvement in form, St Johnstone held on to win the match and claim the first national cup trophy in their 123-year existence.\nPost-match.\nAfter the match, St Johnstone caretaker manager Sandy Stewart declared his interest in becoming the permanent manager but admitted he had already been offered the job as assistant manager to Owen Coyle at Burnley, which he later confirmed. Reflecting on his decision to go to Burnley, Stewart mentioned: \"It was a tricky decision... but, football-wise, I just felt it was too good an opportunity to turn down.\" Dunfermline manager Stephen Kenny praised his team's efforts after the game but admitted that poor defending had resulted in the defeat. Kenny was sacked as manager a week later due to continuing poor league results and was replaced by player Jim McIntyre."

Following the departure of five members in 2021, all remaining conference members participated in the tournament (unless banned due to NCAA sanctions) in 2022. In 2023, the seven highest teams participated in the tournament. The winner receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament. Other teams have to hope for an at-large bid.\nHistory.\nThe Southland Conference tournament began in 1964. The number of annual tournament participants has changed several times over the life of the tournament. From 1964 through 1966 the tournament consisted of three teams. In 1967 and 1968 the tournament expanded to a four-team double-elimination tournament. This was all that constituted conference play for those seasons.\nFrom 1969 until 1992, the Southland Conference did not have a baseball tournament. In some seasons, a championship series was held between division champions.\nIn 1993, the conference began holding a baseball tournament again. From 1993 through 1995, the tournament was a four team double-elimination tournament.,\nIn 1996, it expanded to become a six team double-elimination tournament and remained that way until 2007.\nIn 2008, the tournament once again expanded and became an eight team double-elimination tournament.\nIn 2012, two brackets of four teams were added in a double-elimination format. The winner of each bracket plays in a championship game. This facilitates a television broadcast of the final.\nAfter five schools left the conference following the 2021 season, the tournament format was changed for 2022. The top two seeds hosted double-elimination tournaments that each involved four teams. The winner from each site will advanced to a best-of-3 final hosted by the top surviving seed.\nStarting in 2023, the event moved to Joe Miller Ballpark on the campus of McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana, reportedly as part of a deal that kept McNeese in the Southland after it had been courted by Conference USA and nearly joined the Western Athletic Conference. The agreement with McNeese initially runs for four years, with McNeese having the right of first refusal to continue as host after 2026. The tournament format in 2023 included seven teams beginning with a single-elimination game followed by a 6 team double elimination. Two teams did not qualify for the tournament with the new format.\nThe baseball tournament venue returned to an annual bidding process for 2024 following the men's and women's basketball tournaments venue extension in Lake Charles.

The Head coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 11th year. The team played home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 31-7 (12-4) record while making it to the Championship game of the NCAA tournament.\nThe team was led by junior Rony Seikaly and sophomore Sherman Douglas. Seniors Greg Monroe and Howard Triche, and freshman Derrick Coleman also played key roles.\nSeason recap.\nAfter the graduation of Rafael Addison and Wendell Alexis and the early departure of Dwayne Washington, expectations for the season were low.\nBut behind the surprising Sherman Douglas and Derrick Coleman, and despite an early injury to Rony Seikaly, Syracuse won its first 15 games en route to winning the Big East regular season title. The season included thrilling victories over St. Johns (64-63) and Seton Hall (84-80).\nSyracuse would defeat Villanova and Pittsburgh to advance to the Big East Championship game before falling to Georgetown, 69-59.\nNCAA tournament.\nAfter finishing the regular season at 28-6, the Orangemen earned a 2 seed in the East region of the NCAA tournament.\nSyracuse played its first two tournament games at home in the Carrier Dome. The Orangemen defeated 15 seed Georgia Southern 79-73 and 10 seed Western Kentucky 104-86 to advance to the Sweet 16.\nAfter winning its first two tournament games at the Carrier Dome, the Orangemen moved on to the Sweet 16 held at The Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Orangemen defeated 6 seed Florida 87-81.\nSyracuse faced 1 seed North Carolina in the regional finals. The Orangemen had to fight off the Tar Heels down the stretch as they fought to overcome a 15 point Syracuse lead. However, Syracuse was able to hold off the Tar Heels, winning 79-75 to advance to the Final Four.\nIn the semi-final game, the Orangemen defeated fellow Big East team and 6 seed Providence 77-63. The Orangemen had an easy time with the Friars, out rebounding them 53-35 with Coleman, Douglas, and Triche each having at least 10 rebounds. The Orangemen held the Friars to 36.4% shooting leading Coach Boeheim to credit the team's defense for the win. The Orangemen also held Providence's leading scorer and future Florida Gators head coach Billy Donovan to 8 points, 18 under his season average.\nIn the championship game at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Orangemen matched up against the Indiana Hoosiers coached by Bobby Knight. The game was a back and forth battle down until the final whistle. The Orangemen had a one point lead with 28 seconds left in the second half when Coleman missed the front end of a one and one. Indiana grabbed the rebound and tournament MOP Keith Smart made a jumper from the corner with just seconds left on the clock to give the Hoosiers a one point lead and the National Championship.\nNCAA Tournament school records.\nThe team's 104 point outburst against Western Kentucky in the second round is tied for the most points in a tournament game.\nRony Seikaly's 138 points is a school record and was tied with Indiana's Steve Alford for most in that year's tournament. He also set records for field goals and free throws made with 53 and 51, respectively.\nDerrick Coleman's 19 rebounds against Indiana is a school record that still stands as of 2008.

They were playing at Three Rivers Stadium, with 23,934 people attending the game. In the top of the seventh inning, Ryan was asked to pinch hit for pitcher Greg Swindell, batting ninth. With runners on first and third base, Pirates pitcher Marc Wilkins balked in Ryan's first at-bat, which made all the players on base advance to the next base as a result, with the runner on third, Steve Finley, scoring a run for the Diamondbacks. Ryan ultimately grounded out, second to first, on his at-bat. In the bottom of the seventh, pitcher Dan Plesac was called to replace Ryan, pitching and batting ninth. The Diamondbacks lost the game by the score of 5–4.\nCareer after debut.\nOn June 19, , Ryan was traded by the Diamondbacks to the Oakland Athletics for Ryan Christenson.

        "text": "Beach volleyball was introduced at the Summer Olympic Games in the 1992 Games as a demonstration event, and has been an official Olympic sport since 1996. The United States is the only country to win medals in every edition.\nWinning the Olympics is considered to be the highest honor in international beach volleyball, followed by the World Championships, and the World Tour of the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) for men and women.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nBeach volleyball was a demonstration sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, at which Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos won the men's tournament, and Karolyn Kirby and Nancy Reno won the women's.\nBeach volleyball was introduced as an official Olympic sport in 1996. A total of 24 teams take part in each beach volleyball Olympic tournament. Teams qualify on the basis of their performance in FIVB (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball) events over the course of about 18 months before the Olympic Games. There is a limit of two teams per country, and one spot apiece is reserved for the host country and a randomly chosen wild-card country. In the event that any Olympic region is not represented, the highest ranked team from that continent qualifies for the tournament.\nMen's beach volleyball.\nThe men's tournament has had a constant number of teams, with 24 couples in each edition.\nIn the first tournament, played in the 1996 Olympics, the matches were played at \"Atlanta Beach\" in Jonesboro, Georgia. The winners of the semifinals played for the gold and silver medals. The losers of the semifinal played for third and fourth places. The final was contested between the Americans Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes versus Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh. Kiraly is so far the only person with Olympic medals in both indoor and beach volleyball since he had won the gold medal indoors in the tournament of 1984 as well as 1988 in Seoul, South Korea.\nThe beach volleyball tournament of 2000 was played in Bondi Beach, a suburb of Sydney. The winners were again an American team, Blanton/Fonoimoana, defeating Brazilians Zé Marco/Ricardo (the former had competed in Atlanta) in the finals.\nIn the 2004 Summer Olympics the tournament was held in the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex, in Athens, Greece. The Brazilians Emanuel/Ricardo (the former being a veteran of two Olympics, and the latter a silver medalist in 2000) won the gold medal, defeating Bosma and Herrera of Spain.\nThe beach volleyball tournament of 2008 was carried out at the Beach Volleyball Ground, located in the Chaoyang Park in Beijing. In an upset, reigning champions Emanuel and Ricardo were defeated by their compatriots Márcio Araújo (who competed in Athens) and Fábio Luiz in the semifinal, having to settle for the bronze (where they beat two Brazilians competing for Georgia). The Brazilian victors were then defeated by Americans Rogers and Dalhausser in the final.\nThe 2012 tournament was played at the Horse Guards Parade in London. Emanuel Rego, now paired with Alison Cerutti, got his third straight medal, completing the three podium colors, by reaching the finals, where he lost to Germans Brink and Reckermann. Mārtiņš Pļaviņš and Jānis Šmēdiņš from Latvia got the bronze.\nAfter 16 years, the 2016 tournament again was held in an actual beach, Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. Alison Cerutti, now partnered with Bruno Schmidt, returned to the finals, and won the gold beating Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai of Italy in the finals. The Dutch Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen completed the podium.\nThe 2020 Olympics, held in 2021 after a delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, had beach volleyball at Shiokaze Park. Norwegians Anders Mol and Christian Sørum won gold, beating in the final Russians Viacheslav Krasilnikov, who had finished 2016 in fourth place, and Oleg Stoyanovskiy. Brazil missed not only the finals but the podium as a whole for the first time since the inaugural tournament, both pairs eliminated by eventual fourth place team Mārtiņš Pļaviņš and Edgars Točs.\nWomen's beach volleyball.\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996, there were eighteen teams entered, and the championship match was played between two Brazilian teams: Jackie Silva and Sandra Pires versus Mônica Rodrigues and Adriana Samuel. The Australians Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst edged out the Americans for the bronze medal.\nAt the Sydney Olympics of 2000, the number of teams was increased to 24. One of the two Australian teams, Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst, won the gold medal over the Brazilians Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede, four years after winning the bronze medal in Atlanta. Another Brazilian team, featuring 1996 champion Sandra Pires and runner-up Adriana Samuel, edged out the Japanese for the bronze medal.\nBehar and Bede of Brazil avenged the 2000 defeat by beating Natalie Cook (now partnered with Nicole Sanderson) in the 2004 semifinal to return to the final match, but they were defeated by Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh of the United States. Both May-Treanor and Walsh were veterans of the Sydney Olympics, but Walsh had been part of the American indoor team. Another American team, Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs (the former in her third tournament, having been fourth in Atlanta), defeated the Australian team for the bronze medal.\nIn 2008 in China, May-Treanor and Walsh (now going by her married name of Walsh Jennings) were victorious again by defeating the Chinese team of Tian Jia and Wang Jie in the finals. Another Chinese team won the bronze medal, edging out Brazil in fourth place, and thus sending the Brazilian women home without a medal for the first time in the tournament history.\nIn 2012 in England May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings won for the third consecutive Olympiad by defeating the other American team of April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the championship game. Thus the United States finished with the gold and silver medals, with Brazil winning the bronze medal, edging out China in fourth place.\nThe 2016 tournament in Brazil had the country return to the beach volleyball final after 12 years, with Ágatha Bednarczuk and Bárbara Seixas winning the semifinal over defending champion Walsh Jennings and London silver medalist April Ross. However, they lost the gold medal to the Germans Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst, who had also defeated the Brazilians Talita Antunes (4th in 2008) and Larissa França (bronze in 2012) in the semifinals. Talita and Larissa also lost the bronze medal to the United States, making Walsh Jennings the only player to win four beach volleyball Olympic medals. The defeat also broke a streak where every tournament had one country winning medals with both their teams: Brazil in 1996 (gold and silver) and 2000 (silver and bronze), United States in 2004 (gold and bronze) and 2012 (gold and silver), and China in 2008 (silver and bronze). There were also four teams tied for fifth place: Australia, Canada, Russia, and Switzerland, and hence seven countries were represented in the top eight teams.\nThe 2020 tournament in Japan had April Ross, now partnered with Alix Klineman, winning the gold in her third try, beating in the finals Australians Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar. Joana Heidrich and Anouk Vergé-Dépré of Switzerland, who had played in separate doubles in Rio, got the bronze. Brazil for the first time missed the semifinals, with at most a pair eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Swiss.\nWhile twelve countries won medals in the male tournament, only six have done so with women. The dominating nations are Brazil and the US. Americans have the most gold medals with four. The only countries outside the six medalists (Brazil, USA, Australia, China and Germany) to reach the semifinals were Japan in 2000 and Latvia in 2020.\nCompetition formula.\n1996.\nA double-elimination tournament was played for both men and women until a total of four teams qualified for the semifinals: the two finalist teams of the winners bracket and the two finalist teams of the elimination bracket. The men's field had 24 teams, and the women's field had 16.\nCompetitors were selected through a detailed Olympic qualification process which saw the participation of a total of 587 men's and women's athletes from 46 countries. Each country could qualify up to two teams - host country United States had two spots already guaranteed, with the doubles selected through Olympic Beach Trials held in Baltimore, Maryland.\n2000.\nFollowing an expansion on the women's tournament, both competitions had 24 teams. The format became single elimination, preceded by a preliminary round to define the round of 16 teams - the twelve winners of the preliminary games automatically qualified, while the twelve defeated teams played two elimination rounds to get the remaining four spots.\nThe teams qualify by accumulating points in FIVB Olympic Qualification Tournaments, with one of the host nation having a guaranteed berth and another having the possibility of qualifying through the ranking.\n2004.\nFollowing a FIVB change of rules in 2001, the scoring was changed from sets of 15 points in a superseded sideout system to sets of 21 points in a rally point system.\nThe format had the 24 competing teams were split equally into six pools of four. The top two teams from each pool and the four best third placed teams progressed through to a single-elimination tournament of sixteen teams.\nThe qualifying added a continental quota - in the event of an unrepresented continent, the top team from that continent earned a spot.\n2008–2024.\nThe six pools of four format was retained, but the qualifying for third-placed teams was changed. Of the six 3rd place teams, two were directly qualified to the playoffs. Of the four remaining third placed teams, another two teams get to the playoffs through winning a lucky loser (repechage) match.\nMedal table.\nSources:"

The games were played in Western New York, at HSBC Arena in Buffalo and Niagara University's Dwyer Arena in Lewiston. Russia won the gold medal with a 5–3 victory over Canada in the championship game, after completing the biggest comeback in the WJHC history; being down 3–0 after two periods, the Russians scored five goals in the third period to capture their first WJHC gold medal since 2003. The host team, the United States, won the bronze medal with a 4–2 win over Sweden.\nBid process.\nCo-host of the 2005 tournament, Grand Forks, North Dakota, also submitted a bid to host the 2011 tournament. In addition, Detroit was mentioned as a possible host city.\nSummary.\nExhibition games.\nA series of five exhibition games were held between several of the teams at Sports Centre at MCC in Brighton, New York and the Jamestown Savings Bank Ice Arena in Jamestown, New York in conjunction with, and immediately prior to, the tournament.\nPreliminary round.\nThe Preliminary Round robin consisted of two pools of five teams each, played in a round robin format. The United States (Pool A) and Sweden (Pool B) went undefeated to finish first in their respective pools and earn an automatic berth in the semifinals. To qualify for the quarterfinals, Canada and Russia finished second and third in Pool B while Finland and Switzerland did likewise in Pool A. The remaining teams, Slovakia, Germany, Czech Republic and Norway, were sent to the relegation round.\nRelegation round.\nIn the relegation round, Slovakia and Norway played in the first game, with Slovakia winning 5–0. The Czech Republic defeated Germany 3–2 in the second game. After the first day of action, the final results were decided and the remaining games were meaningless. Germany lost to Norway 3–1 and the Czech Republic defeated Slovakia 5–2 in the final relegation games. Norway and Germany were relegated to Division I for the 2012 tournament.\nMedal round.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first quarterfinal game saw Russia take on Finland. Russia trailed by two goals late in the game, but scored twice to tie and send it to overtime. Evgeny Kuznetsov scored the game-winning goal in overtime. In the other quarterfinal, Canada easily defeated Switzerland 4–1.\nSemifinals.\nThe first semi-final featured Russia and Sweden. Controversy erupted in the second period as an apparent icing call on Russia was waved off by the on-ice officials, allowing the Russians to score and take a 2–0 lead. The Swedish team protested the non-call, but the goal stood. The Swedes did forge a comeback and took a 3–2 lead in the third period, but the Russians scored late to force overtime for the second consecutive game. The game went to a shootout with Russia winning, 4–3. The second semifinal was a highly anticipated rematch of the previous year's gold medal game between Canada and the United States, the defending champions. In front of a mainly Canadian crowd that made the trip to Buffalo, Canada earned a berth in the final with a 4–1 victory over their American rivals.\nFifth place game.\nThe fifth place game featured the losing teams of the quarter-final games. Switzerland defeated Finland 3–2 in a shootout to take fifth place.\nBronze medal game.\nThe United States defeated Sweden 4–2 to win the bronze medal, its first ever WJHC medal on home ice.\nGold medal game.\nThe gold medal game was between Canada and Russia. The game marked Canada's tenth consecutive appearance in the final. The Russians had lost their three previous gold medal games to Canada. Canada led 3-0 after two periods. However, the Russians scored five unanswered goals in the third period, including two in a span of 13 seconds, to win the game 5–3 and capture the gold medal. It was Russia's first gold medal since 2003 and Canada's second straight silver medal finish. Brayden Schenn of Canada was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.\nThe game delivered one of the largest television audiences in Canadian history, with an average of 6.88 million viewers watching on TSN and another 652,000 watching the French-language broadcast on RDS.

        "text": "The 2008 Men's U–19 World Lacrosse Championship (U–19) was held at Percy Perry Stadium in Coquitlam, British Columbia from July 3 to July 12. The event was sponsored by the International Lacrosse Federation. This international field lacrosse tournament is held every four years, and teams are composed of players that are under the age of nineteen.\nThis was the last major event to be sponsored by the ILF. In August 2008, the ILF merged with the former governing body for international women's lacrosse, the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations, to form the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). Future U–19 championships will be sponsored by FIL.\nThe United States won the gold medal, the silver medal winners were Canada and the bronze medal went to the Iroquois Nationals.\nTeams.\nThe 2008 tournament saw twelve nations competing in the championship. Teams were split into two divisions: the elite \"Blue Division\" and the \"Red Division\" consisting of nations where lacrosse is still developing. The tournament consisted of round robin play within a team's division, where each team played every team in its division once. Round robin play established seedings for the following series of single elimination play-in games to compete in the semi-final round.\nThe Blue Division was composed of the following six teams: the United States had won each of the ILF's Under-19 World Lacrosse Championship tournaments since its inception in 1988; Canada led by head coach Gary Gait; Iroquois Nationals, the Nationals are the only First Nations/Native American team to compete in international competition; the up-and-coming England team; Australia, who won the bronze medal in 2003; and Japan, who moved up to the Blue Division after going undefeated in the Red Division in 2003.\nThe Red Division included three nations making their first appearance in an Under-19 World Lacrosse Championship tournament: Bermuda, Finland, and Scotland. Wales and South Korea made their second appearances in the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championship. Germany also participated, but was granted a waiver by the ILF to field a team consisting of Under-21 year olds.\nRound Robin results.\nThe round robin portion of the tournament determined seeding for the semi-finals and the placing games. The top two teams in the Blue Division were awarded automatic semi-final berths, while the third and fourth place teams from the Blue Division met with the first and second place teams from the Red Division in two semi-final \"play-in games\".\nTwo teams went undefeated in their divisions. In the Blue Division, the United States defeated all five opponents in their division to gain the top seed in the semifinals. In the Red Division, Germany won its five round robin games. Prior to this tournament, Germany had never won an international U-19 contest.\nIn the Blue Division there were a number of highly contested games. Canada defeated the Iroquois Nationals in a close game 15–12. England defeated Australia in an overtime game 12–11.\nThe United States earned one of the automatic semi-final berths by winning the division, while Canada earned the second spot based on its 4–1 record. The remaining two semi-finals spots were earned by two play-in games.\nThe \"play-in games\" featured the top-ranked Red Division Germany team facing up against Team England. The English defeated Germany 16–2. The Iroquois Nationals met Team Scotland, and were victorious with a final score of 28–2. The Iroquois Nationals advanced to the semifinals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe July 10 semifinals saw the United States face England, and the Iroquois Nationals face Team Canada. The United States defeated England 25–5, extending their all-time Under-19 tournament record to 35-0. Team Canada defeated the Iroquois Nationals 23–12 on the play of attacker Mark Cockerton, son of Hall of Famer Stan Cockerton, who scored five goals in the contest.\nFinals.\nThe finals took place on July 12, 2008, the United States defeated Canada 19–12. It was the United States' sixth gold medal, and their third consecutive finals victory over Team Canada.

        "title": "Kent Crusaders (basketball)",
        "text": "The Kent Crusaders are an English basketball club based in the town of Canterbury, Kent.\nThe team's history dates back to the early 1990s, but in its current form it has been in existence since 2000. The club has sent three players to professional contracts in Europe, including Ryan Richards, the youngest player ever to play in the Nike Hoop Summit.\nThe club runs an elite 6th form academy based at Canterbury High School, launched in 2007, and stronger links being formed with the juniors in 2008 as the club expanded to include men's, under-18, under-16 and under-14 National League teams.\nClub history.\nOrigins.\nThe roots of the Kent Crusaders began in the early 1990s when Kevin and Christine Paice, Dave Hooper and Hilli Lingham began developing junior basketball at Canterbury College. Through their work, the Canterbury Jazz and CK Heat were born. As the club gathered momentum, the college became the place to be for basketball in East Kent. Trevor Acres and Kevin Maloney joined the coaching staff and numerous boys were given the opportunity to play National League and the club won numerous Kent cups. In 2000, ex-player and young coach Jay Gifford took over the club. He was joined a year later by Canadian Jesse Sazant. Coach Sazant took the team to new heights, including a National Under 16 quarterfinal in his first season. At this point the club was relaunched as the East Kent Crusaders.\nNational League.\nAfter losing older players to the London clubs for years, the club decided to launch a men's EBL Division 3 team in 2004. In their first season the club finished third in Division 3 South East. The initial season saw a number of the club's former junior players return to the Crusaders to be joined by a number of local players. In their second season the team quickly progressed, winning the 2005/06 EBL Division 3 South East and making the finals of the National Shield. The club also signed their first foreign player, 6'10 Canadian Walter Moyse and foreign coach assistant, Dane Mads Olesen. The 2005/06 team was led by Walter Moyse, Paul Jessop and Robbie Parker, and featured 14-year old Ryan Richards, a 2007 Nike Hoop Summit World Team Player and a 2008 Euroleague Final Four: Nike International Junior Tournament player with Real Madrid. The Crusaders got promoted to EBL Division 2 and were renamed the Kent Crusaders in summer 2006. While the club signed a number of new players it also lost Moyse, Parker and Richards to contracts in Europe. Initially the remaining players and new signings London Towers players Sam Betts and James Acres, Reading Rockets guard Damion Lyons, former Crusaders junior Angelo Irving and East London's Gary Davison and JP Dontoni, fared well, winning the first three league games, before fading down the stretch and only being assured another season in Division 2 in the last round of games. On 2 April 2007, Jesse Sazant stepped down as head coach to concentrate on a role as chairman and director of basketball, passing the coaching reins to Mads Olesen. The 2007 offseason season saw the Crusaders lose team leaders captain Paul Jessop, leading scorer and starting point guard Gary Davidson, big man Angelo Irving, guard James Parker, forward JP Dontoni, and forward James Acres, but in his new role as Director of Basketball Jesse Sazant managed to recruit young talented players to make up for the losses. Two young Barking Abbey Basketball Academy players, 6'0 18-year-old guard Rikki Broadmore (Under 18's Reading Rockets National League and Cup champion) and 6'6 forward, 18-year-old former England Under 16's player Dan Garrad. Additionally 20-year-old JP Dimandja, a 6’6 forward with untapped potential and athleticism joined from Eastside Eagles. The team struggled early in the season as the young players adjusted to the physicality of men's basketball while the returning players adjusted to their new roles as team leaders, crashing out of the Patrons Cup and losing twelve of the first sixteen league games. The team was able to secure another season in Division 3 with three games to go with a key away win at Team Northumbria. The 2007/08 season also saw the start of the Kent Crusaders and Canterbury High School Basketball Sixth Form Academy. The academy accepted 12 players in its first year and was coached by Damian Lyons and Sam Bets. The academy focuses on developing player fundamentals and academy player Adam Brown managed to play in two games for the Crusaders men's team.\nCurrent club.\nThe 2008 off season saw the Crusaders management focus stability on the men's team as they secured that the key players from the previous season stayed on. Also in the summer of 2008 the Kent Crusaders men's Club and the East Kent Crusaders Junior Basketball Club merged into one club and added Under 18's, 16's and 14's EBL National League teams to the club. The Kent Crusaders Basketball Academy are based at Canterbury High School.\nStudent athletes at the academies receive daily coaching in addition to dedicated time for strength and conditioning work. Alongside this the 6th form students study a BTEC in Sports Performance and Excellence (which is equivalent to two A-levels) as well as 2 other courses of their choice. The school competes in the Elite Academies Basketball League. Additionally, players are expected to play at the highest club level they can. Current academy members play for the Crusaders national league team, under 18 team and a number of local men's teams.\nPartnership with Barking Abbey.\nIn 2014, the Crusaders' men's team formed a partnership with the elite academy at Barking Abbey School. During this period, the best young players from the Barking Abbey team would form the nucleus of the Crusaders in National League competitions, first as the Kent Crusaders, and then as the Barking Abbey Crusaders. Their combined efforts were successful; winning the D1 Playoffs in 2015 and D2 Playoffs in 2017. Such was the high turnover of players brought by being based around age-group players, the Crusaders were relegated to Division 2 in 2016. The partnership ended in 2019, with Barking retaining the Crusaders place in Division 1 and competing solely as Barking Abbey, and the Crusaders focusing on a Division 3 National League team based around the elite Canterbury Academy program."

He won 25 caps for Wales between 1903 and 1911.\nTravers is seen as one of the rugby union's first specialist hookers. Specialism in a forward position was unusual during the early history of rugby mainly due to the scrummaging rule, but Travers's ability shone through and as part of a seven-man pack was important in the Welsh wins against England in 1903 and in the famous \"Match of the Century\" victory against the All Blacks in 1905. Travers originally played club rugby for the Newport Docks-based side Pill Harriers, though he would later spend two seasons with Newport in 1901/02 and 1910/11.\nInternational career.\nTravers was first capped, at centre, making his debut against England in January, 1903 while playing for Pill Harriers. Although it was unusual at the time for unfashionable \"second-class\" clubs to supply international players, it was not unprecedented, with valley teams such as Treorchy and Treherbert supplying several forwards. He would play for Wales a further 24 times including games against the original New Zealand team, South Africa and Australia. In 1908 Travers was awarded the Welsh captaincy against Scotland at Swansea a game Wales would win 6-5, though this was the only time he would hold this honour. His only international points were against the Australian Wallabies, a game Wales won 9-6, though it has been later recognised by both sides that Travers dropped the ball before going over the line and the try should not have counted.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Keith Miller with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948",
        "text": "Keith Miller was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948 and went undefeated in its 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned the Australians the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\". Miller was an all-rounder: a right-arm opening fast bowler and a right-handed middle-order batsman. With Ray Lindwall, he formed Australia's first-choice opening attack, a combination regarded as one of the best of all time. Miller was also a skillful slip fielder, regarded by his captain as the best in the world.\nMiller played a vital role in the side's success in the Test series, particularly with the ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He played a key role in subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with a barrage of short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all first-class matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.\nMiller's character, joie de vivre and love of cricket were expressed on the field during the tour, particularly in the tour games, when he played several carefree innings, hitting many sixes. He also showed his disdain for Bradman's obsession with annihilating the opposition. In one match against Essex, he deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball in protest against Australia's ruthless approach to batting; that day, his side set a world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket (721).\nMiller's charisma—coupled with the unprecedented popularity of the Australians—meant that he was in demand at social events on the tour. His friendship with Princess Margaret was also particularly scrutinised by the media.\nBackground.\nMiller had played for Australia in every Test match since the resumption of international cricket after World War II. A specialist batsman before the war, he emerged as a frontline fast bowler during the Victory Tests, a series of friendly games between England and Australia in 1945. He made his official Test debut against New Zealand in early 1946. Since the Test series against England during the 1946–47 Australian summer, he had opened the bowling with Ray Lindwall and played as a frontline batsman, usually at number five in the batting order. Miller played a leading role in Australia's 3–0 victory over the hosts in that series. He finished at the top of the Australian Test bowling averages with 16 wickets at 20.88, and was second in the batting averages, scoring 384 runs at 76.80. In particular, his pace and intimidating bouncers had troubled England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton. He dismissed Hutton thrice and took the wicket of his opening partner Cyril Washbrook twice. In addition to scoring his maiden Test century in the series, Miller also hit three scores over 150 for his state, Victoria; his runs were scored at a rapid pace and featured many powerful shots.\nMiller had a light workload in the 1947–48 home Test series against India, which Australia won 4–0; his teammates often finished off the opposition before he had an opportunity, particularly with the bat. He was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185 runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries. His 72 overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. Lindwall and Miller were selected by captain Donald Bradman and his fellow selectors for the 1948 tour of England as the intended new ball pairing.\nEarly tour.\nMiller and his teammates arrived in Southampton in April after a sea voyage from Australia aboard the \"SS Strathaird\". Following the custom for their tours of England, Australia fielded its first-choice team in the traditional opening game against Worcestershire. Miller was selected and started the \"Invincibles\" tour strongly. He scored a hard-hitting 50 not out, with five fours and a six, after coming in to bat at No. 9. He bowled 20 overs in the game for figures of 1/54, and Australia completed an innings victory.\nThe tour opener was followed by a game against Leicestershire; Miller was promoted to No. 3. At the fall of the first wicket, the crowd surged towards the players' gate, expecting Bradman to enter in his customary batting position. Miller emerged instead, and scored an unbeaten 202 in five and a half hours, although he was dropped three times. He featured in a 111-run second wicket partnership with Sid Barnes, before putting on 159 with Bradman for the third wicket. After a late-order collapse, in which no other batsman passed 12, it was left to last man Bill Johnston to partner Miller from 180 onwards. The pair put on 37 for the tenth wicket before Johnston was out for 12, allowing Miller to complete a double century. One of his sixes concussed a spectator. After his long innings, Miller did not bowl in the first innings, but was used late in the second innings and took 2/10. Australia completed another innings triumph.\nThe next match was against Yorkshire, for whom Hutton played; it gave both Miller and Hutton an opportunity to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. In cold and blustery conditions, Miller reduced his pace and bowled medium-paced off breaks, operating throughout most of the innings and taking 6/42 in 23.3 overs. He removed Hutton for five after the Yorkshireman had struggled for an hour in the middle. Yorkshire were all out for 71 on a wet wicket. In reply, Australia scored just 101; Miller scored a counter-attacking 34, the highest individual score in the match. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced. He then took 3/49 in the second innings as Yorkshire were all out for 89 to leave Australia a victory target of 60. He was dismissed for two, caught at long off after attempting to hit a six from the spin of Johnny Wardle to leave Australia 3/13. The remaining batsmen struggled and Australia lost six wickets before scoring the winning runs; this was the closest the team came to defeat on the whole tour, and Miller's performance in the match was instrumental in preserving the unbeaten record.\nAfter three consecutive three-day matches, which involved playing in nine days out of ten, Miller sat out the next match against Surrey at The Oval, which Australia won by an innings. He returned to take seven wickets in the next fixture against Cambridge University. In the first innings, he resumed his battle with John Dewes, whom he had troubled during the Victory Tests in 1945. This time, Dewes put a thick towel under his shirt for protection against an anticipated short-pitched barrage; instead, Miller followed a short ball with a yorker to dismiss him. He then took the last three wickets to end with 5/46 as the hosts were bowled out for 167 in the first innings. Miller was not required to bat as Australia amassed 4/414 declared then took 2/29 as his team completed an innings victory.\nThe next match was against Essex. Australia, having elected to bat, had reached 2/364 when Miller came out to bat midway through the first day, after Bradman and Bill Brown had scored 219 runs for the second wicket in 90 minutes. Miller took guard and deliberately let his first ball, from Trevor Bailey, hit the stumps, much to Bradman's displeasure. Miller later said that he was making a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest; Australia went on to score 721 runs on the first day, a record number of runs in a single day of first-class cricket. The former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, who covered the Australian tour as a journalist, said: \"Under the circumstances at Southend, I could well understand his [Miller's] feelings\". When he bowled, Miller took Essex's first three wickets to reduce the hosts to 3/13, and ended with 3/14 in their total of 83. He bowled just two overs, without taking any more wickets, when Bradman enforced the follow on; Australia won by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the season. Bradman rested Miller for the next game against Oxford University, which Australia won by an innings.\nIn the lead-up to the Tests, Australia took on the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. Bradman's men batted first, and Miller came to the crease at 3/200. Sharing partnerships of 80 runs for the fourth wicket with Lindsay Hassett, 63 for the fifth with Brown and 155 with Ian Johnson for the sixth, Miller scored 163 runs in 250 minutes, hitting 20 fours and three sixes. The Australians hit nine sixes off the off spin bowling of Jim Laker on the second morning of the match in an attempt to establish their mastery of him before the Test series. After Miller's dismissal, Australia were out for 552. With the ball, Miller and Lindwall attempted to maintain their ascendancy over Hutton, who was playing for MCC. On this occasion, he scored 52 and 64, but MCC were defeated by an innings and 158 runs. Miller had figures of 3/28 and 1/37. He dismissed England Test batsman Bill Edrich, who had been a prolific scorer in recent English seasons, and was expected to be one of the key batsmen in the forthcoming Ashes series. Miller twice took the wicket of Jack Robertson, who was thought to be in contention for England selection; after two low scores against Miller, he was overlooked. In addition to his performance on the field, Miller solved some off-field problems. The MCC—which administered cricket at the time—provided him with legal assistance in his contract dispute with Rawtenstall Cricket Club. The Australian all-rounder had signed a contract to play for the club in the Lancashire League, but failed to honour it. Rawtenstall dropped the dispute after being offered compensation.\nMiller was rested for the next match against Lancashire, which was drawn after the first day was lost to rain. He returned against Nottinghamshire and scored 51 of Australia's total of 400. Miller took a wicket in each innings, including that of Test batsman Reg Simpson, to end with 2/67 as Australia drew its second consecutive match. In the next match, against Hampshire, Miller bowled 19 overs without reward, taking 0/39 as the home team batted first and scored 195. In reply, Australia was in trouble after rain turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Miller came in at 2/38 and launched a counter-attack, scoring 39 of the 53 runs added before he fell with the score at 5/91. The Australians were all out for 117, conceding a first innings lead of 78, the first time during the tour that they had been behind on the first innings. Miller's top score of 39 included three consecutive sixes from the bowling of Charlie Knott, who took 5/57. In Hampshire's second innings, he took 5/25 and bowled three of his victims. The tourists dismissed Hampshire for 103, leaving a target of 182, which Australia achieved with eight wickets to spare without Miller having to bat. He was rested for the match against Sussex at Hove, after six consecutive days of cricket. In its last match before the Tests, Australia completed an innings victory in just two days.\nFirst Test.\nBefore the Tests, Fingleton expected the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen would be unable to adapt to the demands of facing world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at Trent Bridge. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it went to ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.\nMiller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after lunch, but was unable to extract an edge. Miller held a catch—described by \"Wisden\" as \"dazzling\"—when Joe Hardstaff junior edged Johnston into the slips and was out for a duck. Two runs later, he bowled Compton, who was attempting a leg sweep. As a result, half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board after 100 minutes of play. England fell to 8/74, but recovered with an 89-run ninth-wicket partnership between Alec Bedser and Laker. Miller ended the innings by removing Laker—caught behind for 63—leaving England all out for 165. The paceman ended with 3/38 from 19 overs.\nOn the second day, Miller came in at 2/121—O'Reilly believed that Bradman was trying to force the pace and had promoted Miller above Lindsay Hassett, the usual number four batsman—and was dismissed for a duck; he failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on instead of turning in, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich. After Australia finished at 509 on the third day to take a 344-run lead, Miller opened the bowling with Johnston—Lindwall was injured while bowling in the first innings and was unable to take to the field. Miller removed Washbrook for one, caught behind by Tallon from a top-edged hook shot. Washbrook was displeased with the decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating his opinion that the ball hit his clothing rather than the bat.\nMiller continued his battle with Hutton and Compton, although he resorted to bowling off spin from a shorter run to conserve energy late in the day. Hutton hit three fours in quick succession from Miller's bowling to reach his fifty. The paceman responded to the spate of boundaries by reverting to pace and bowling a series of bouncers, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left (front) arm. The batsmen survived, but the bowler received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his barrage of short-pitched bowling. Some of the spectators shouted \"Bodyline\". Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. Hutton responded by glancing Miller for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 2/121 at stumps on the third day, with Hutton and Compton still at the crease. Miller was jeered and heckled as he left the field at the end of play. The crowd surged towards him as he walked up the steps into the dressing room, but there was no altercation. O'Reilly later defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that his field settings were less intimidatory than those of Bodyline.\nAfter a rest day on the Sunday of the game, England resumed on Monday with England still 223 runs in arrears. The Nottinghamshire secretary H. A. Brown broadcast an appeal to the spectators via the public address system, urging them to refrain from barracking Miller. In response, they clapped when the Australians took to the field. The chairman of Nottinghamshire reportedly apologised to Bradman in private regarding the crowd reaction to Miller. Taking the new ball in the fifth over of the day, in the overcast conditions that morning, Miller bowled a relatively full length, rather than bouncers, and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. Shortly after a break for bad light, he bowled Hutton with an off cutter. This brought in Hardstaff, who was dropped from his third delivery by Arthur Morris at slip. In the remainder of the over, Hardstaff played and missed, then edged two further balls; the second edge went for four runs through the slips. During the morning session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row to pressurise the Englishmen.\nAnother catch went down off Miller late in the day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller completed a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.\nThe next day, Compton was out hit wicket for 184 when he tried unsuccessfully to avoid a bouncer from Miller. Fingleton described the dismissal as \"a most depressing end to an innings that will live always\". Australia quickly finished off the hosts' innings; Miller bowled Laker for four, before England reached 441, leaving Australia with a victory target of 98 in three hours. Miller ended with 4/125 for the innings and 7/163 for the match, having removed England's two leading batsmen in both innings and bowled 63 overs—more than his usual workload—because Lindwall was injured. As the players were walking back to the pavilion after England's innings, Miller received another hostile reception. One spectator threatened him with violence, prompting the Australian to grab him by his coat collar, challenging him to enter the Australian dressing room. The spectator declined. Miller was not required to bat as Australia went on to win by eight wickets.\nAfter the heavy bowling workload at Trent Bridge, Bradman rested Miller for the innings win against Northamptonshire, which started the day after the Test. Miller returned for another match against Yorkshire, albeit with a lighter bowling load. He scored 20 in the first innings and made a duck in the second. Nevertheless, he opened the bowling in the first innings with the intention of keeping the pressure on Hutton, although he did not dismiss him in this game. The paceman was barracked by the spectators, who shouted \"What about Larwood\" in response to the repeated short-pitched bowling during his six wicketless overs. Bradman spared Miller from bowling in the second innings because of a back complaint, attempting to preserve him for the Second Test.\nSecond Test.\nThe Second Test match was held at Lord's, but Miller was still unable to bowl when it began. He came in to bat in the first innings with Australia at 3/166 on the first afternoon after electing to bat. Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers; the fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller was hit on the pads not offering a shot, believing that the ball would have curved away past the stumps. The umpire upheld England's appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) and Miller was out for four. O'Reilly blamed Miller's poor form with the bat on an excessive bowling workload imposed on him by Bradman. Australia made 350, but suffered a blow when Lindwall's injury flared up in the first over; Lindwall played on through the pain. Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that the all rounder would reverse his decision not to bowl and take inspiration from Lindwall. The injured bowler returned the ball, citing his back. His gesture generated news headlines among journalists who believed that he had disobeyed Bradman.\nAlthough Bradman claimed that the exchange had been amicable, others disputed this. Teammate Barnes later claimed that Miller had responded to Bradman that he—a very occasional slower bowler—bowl himself. Barnes said that the captain \"was as wild as a battery-stung brumby\" and warned his unwilling bowler that there would be consequences for his defiance. In unpublished writings in his personal collection, Fingleton recorded that Bradman chastised his players in the dressing room at the end of the play, saying \"I'm 40 and I can do my full day's work in the field.\" According to Fingleton, Miller snapped in reply: \"So would I—if I had fibrositis\".\nEngland fell to 4/46 after Lindwall and Johnston's new ball burst, but Compton and Yardley fought back to take the score to 133 without further loss. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, dismissing the batsman for 53. Soon after, Johnston removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller after lashing out at a wide ball outside off stump to leave the hosts at 7/145.\nAustralia bowled England out for 215 at the beginning of the third day to take a 135-run first innings lead. This had increased to 431 when Miller came to the crease with the score at 3/296 during the afternoon. English captain Yardley was on a hat-trick, having removed Hassett first ball after the fall of Barnes. Miller survived a loud lbw appeal on the hat-trick ball before hitting a six into the grandstand and reaching stumps on 22, with Australia at 4/329. He resumed on the fourth morning and reached lunch on 63 with the tourists at 4/409. Miller was reprieved when Tom Dollery dropped a catch from a ball he skied into the air. When the new ball was taken, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, to lift the run rate. Miller repeatedly hooked Coxon and drove Bedser for many runs. After lunch, he hit out at every opportunity before the declaration. He was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from the bowling of Laker. Australia declared at 7/460 to set England a target of 596.\nEngland reached 3/106 by stumps on the fourth day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling on his back and completing the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton's dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.\nAfter the end of the Lord's Test, Miller attended a concert and party, before returning to the team hotel after dawn the next morning, just before breakfast. Bradman noticed this and addressed him as \"Keith\", rather than his nickname \"Nugget\". Australia was due to play Surrey at The Oval on the same day. Bradman won the toss and elected to field. Instead of deploying him to his usual slips position, the Australian skipper sent Miller to field on the fine leg boundary as a punishment for his late night out. Between overs, the banished player had to walk to the opposite end of the ground to be in position for the bowler from the other end. One of the spectators felt sorry for him and lent his bicycle, which the Australian used to cycle around the edge of the ground between overs. Soon after, Bradman brought his all rounder into a fielding position closer to the centre. Miller eventually scored nine in his only innings and was asked to bowl just one over in the second innings, as Australia completed victory by ten wickets. He had a quiet period on the field during July; his cricket generated fewer media stories than his celebrity appearances at social functions and classical music concerts during this time. The match against Surrey was immediately followed by a match against Gloucestershire in Bristol, where Miller scored 51, featuring in a partnership of 136 with Morris (290). Australia piled on 7/774 declared, its largest score of the season, before proceeding to victory by an innings and 363 runs. Acting captain Hassett allowed Miller to rest and he did not bowl during the match.\nThird Test.\nThe England selectors dropped Hutton for the third Test, held at Old Trafford, largely because of his struggles against Miller and Lindwall. The Australians considered this a blunder, as they rated Hutton to be England's best batsman.\nMiller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in the first innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest he came to a catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the half-volley. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The run rate picked up in the last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia struggled against the new ball in the first hour. Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before Dick Pollard trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.\nMiller returned to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not for the first time during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.\nBetween Tests, Australia had one tour match against Middlesex at Lord's. Bradman rested Miller as Australia won by ten wickets, giving him an eight-day break between the Tests.\nFourth Test.\nThe teams moved to Headingley for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Hutton was recalled and the home team won the toss and batted first. England tallied 496, its highest score of the series. Miller took the last wicket of Yardley to finish with 1/43. Generally unthreatening throughout the innings, he bowled only 17.1 overs; the other frontline bowlers sent down at least 33 each. The innings started badly for Miller. He bowled below his full pace and his opening over yielded three full tosses. In Miller's first over, Hutton scored the first boundary of the day, driving past mid-off. He felt his legs for muscle strains, and after two overs that O'Reilly described as \"very innocuous\", Miller was taken off. Nursing fitness concerns, Miller was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks on the second day as England proceeded to 2/423 and appeared to be in complete control, before losing 8/73. In reply, Australia was struggling at 3/68 on the third morning. Neil Harvey—playing his first Ashes Test—joined Miller at the crease. Both had walked out in the same over, as Pollard removed Bradman and Hassett in the space of three balls. Australia was more than 400 behind, and if England were to remove the pair quickly, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a hefty first innings lead. Harvey asked his senior partner \"What’s going on here, eh? Let's get stuck into 'em\". The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted Laker's first ball over square leg for six. Miller shielded the left-handed Harvey from Laker, as his partner was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him, especially one that spun, bounced, and beat his outside edge. The all rounder drilled one off-drive from Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next to the amusement of the crowd, struck the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined in during the next over. The left-hander hit consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He followed this with another boundary to reach 44. Miller then lifted Laker for a six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head, and another over long on from Yardley's bowling to move from 42 to 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. Yardley responded by stacking his leg side with outfielders and bowling outside leg stump, challenging Miller to another hit for six. The batsman attempted to oblige, but insteadedged the ball onto wicket-keeper Evans' head; Edrich dived forward and caught the ball on the rebound at short fine leg. The crowd was in raptures at both the batting and Edrich's catch.\nThe partnership had yielded 121 runs in only 90 minutes, and \"Wisden\" likened it to a \"hurricane\". Cricket commentator John Arlott described the innings as the most memorable that he had witnessed. He said \"Miller played like an emperor...Every stroke would have been memorable but each one had bettered its predecessor\", saying that his batting had raised cricket \"to a point of aesthetic beauty\". Fingleton said that he had never \"known a more enjoyable hour\" of \"delectable cricket\". He acclaimed Miller's innings as \"one of the rarest gems in the Test collection of all time\" and \"a moment to live in the cricket memory\". O'Reilly said that Miller and Harvey had counter-attacked with \"such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation\".\nThe momentum swung in Australia's favour. Harvey scored 112, while Loxton made 93, hitting a further five sixes from Laker. Lindwall added 77 late in the afternoon as Australia finished at 9/457 on the fourth day, having added 394 in one day's play. At the start of the second innings, Miller bowled a tight opening spell and the English openers scored only five from his six overs as they tried to establish a solid start. Miller took 1/53 in the second innings, removing Bedser and catching Compton yet again as Australia was set a world record chase of 404 on the final day in just 345 minutes. A 301-run second wicket partnership between Morris and Bradman set up the run-chase and Miller came in with the score at 2/358. He made only 12 but Australia won by seven wickets to set a new world record and take a 3–0 series lead.\nThe day after the Test, the Australians moved onto their next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored 57 and took 3/31 in the first innings but bowled only two overs as Australia won by an innings. In a rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, Miller took 2/41 in the hosts' first innings of 197 before compiling a hard-hitting 84. Coming in to join Hassett with the score at 2/67, he struck five sixes and seven fours. He hit one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. Miller also attacked the Glamorgan captain Wilf Wooller, hitting him over the sightscreen with straight drives from consecutive balls and lofting a third six over long off. He was finally dismissed while attempting another six; Australia's first innings was washed out at 3/215.\nMiller was rested for the nine-wicket win against Warwickshire. He returned against Lancashire. On the final day, Lancashire batsman Jack Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers. Bradman took the new ball and gave it to Miller, who refused to bowl, saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century. The Australian skipper gave the ball to Lindwall, who promptly removed Ikin for 99. Miller had a light workload for the match, scoring 24 and 11, and taking a total of 1/32 from 16 overs. In the next game, he came in with Australia in difficulty at 5/133, and scored 55 in faster than even time against Durham in the last match before the Fifth Test. The match was a two-day fixture that was not given first-class status. Miller took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply to Australia's 282 when rain ended the match at the end of the opening day.\nFifth Test.\nThe teams proceeded to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced the start of the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp in the head with a bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.\nLater tour matches.\nSeven matches remained after the Test series was concluded. Miller was rested for the innings victory over Kent, but played against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's against an amateur team with many Test players. He scored 69, putting on 157 with Hassett, before being dismissed after attempting a third consecutive hooked boundary. Australia declared at 5/610 and Miller took a match total of 3/76 in another innings victory, including the wickets of Yardley and Martin Donnelly. In the following match against Somerset, Miller had a light workload, scoring an unbeaten 37 at No. 8 as Australia made 5/560 declared, and then bowling only eight overs and taking one wicket as Australia claimed victory by an innings and 374 runs after bowling out the hosts for 115 and 71. He was rested from the match against South of England, which ended in a rain-affected draw.\nAustralia's biggest challenge after the Test series came against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England eleven; for this tour, Bradman insisted that no more than six current Test players be allowed to represent for the hosts. The Australian skipper then fielded a full-strength team. Miller returned for this match, held at Scarborough, but did little, scoring one in his only innings and bowling eight overs without success in a match that ended in a rain-affected draw.\nThis left only two non-first-class matches against Scotland to complete the tour. Miller played in the first game and scored six in his only innings and did not take a wicket, before being rested for the second match. Australia won both matches by an innings. As a result, Australia finished the tour with 25 wins and nine draws. They had gone through the summer without defeat.\nWhen asked about the three most beautiful things in England, Miller said \"The hills of Derbyshire, the leg sweep of Denis Compton and Princess Margaret\". Having already gained a high profile in England during the Victory Tests of 1945 and possessing good looks, he was a popular celebrity throughout the country. In 1948, he was sought out for many social functions, such as at music or theatrical performances, and at dinner receptions with members of the Royal Family, peerage and political leaders. His friendship with Princess Margaret—the second daughter of King George VI—was the subject of widespread media speculation as to whether a romantic liaison was involved.\nRole.\nDuring the tour, Miller generally played in the Tests as an opening bowler alongside Lindwall and as a middle-order batsman, coming in at No. 4 or No. 5. His batting ability was such that he played as a specialist batsman even when he was unable to bowl due to injury, such as during the Second Test. Miller wanted to play purely as a batsman, feeling that the workload of bowling would hinder his run-scoring. However, Bradman was intent on going through the tour undefeated, and utilised his bowling options to the full, to maximise the Australians’ chances of winning. Lindwall and Miller were the first-choice pace duo, regarded as one of the greatest speed pairings in the history of cricket, whereas the latter was just one of many accomplished batsmen in the team. As a result, the Australian skipper valued Miller more as an opening bowler. He ended the Tests with 184 runs at 26.28 and 13 wickets at 23.15 from 138.1 overs and took eight catches.\nDuring the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, except in the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which resulted in a reshuffle in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although his average of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he batted in a variety of positions, as did all of the squad, because Bradman used a rotation system to rest his team because many matches were played consecutively.\nWhen fit, Miller opened the Test bowling with Lindwall, and the pair bowled in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. The English cricket authorities had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs. The pre-existing rule stipulated that a replacement ball would be available every 200 runs, which usually took much more time to accumulate. This played directly into the hands of the Australians with their vastly stronger pace attack, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice bowlers for a fresh attack every 55 overs. With 13 wickets in the Tests, Miller was third among the Australians behind Lindwall and Johnston, who took 27 apiece. Owing to his fragility, Miller was used sparingly compared to the other four Australian frontline bowlers: Toshack and Johnson each delivered more than 170 overs despite playing in one less Test, while Lindwall bowled 224 and Johnston 306 in five matches. In all first-class matches, Miller took 56 wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no intervening rest day, so Bradman ensured that his leading pace duo remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a smaller proportion of the bowling during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4 and Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Doug Ring—who was only selected in one Test—bowled 542.4 overs, while all rounders Colin McCool and Loxton bowled 399.4 and 361.2 overs respectively. McCool did not play in any Tests, while Loxton was only entrusted with 63 overs against England. As such, in some tour matches, Miller was not asked to bowl at all, in order to keep him fresh for the Tests.\nAfter the tour, Bradman was full of praise for Miller, although somewhat critical of his aggressive batting, which the Australian captain thought to be reckless: Bradman criticised Miller's hitting of sixes (26), feeling that his mercurial all rounder lacked restraint and concentration. In contrast, Fingleton praised Miller's attitude to cricket, saying \"He is never one to accept runs when they are there for the taking ... I acknowledge myself the supreme believer in Miller as a cricketer. He had given me joy in the game approached by others.\" With respect to his persistent bouncing of Hutton and Compton, Fingleton said that it was up to England to develop bowlers of express pace—which they lacked at the time—to retaliate against or deter the Australians from pursuing such tactics. Miller's persistent disagreements with Bradman soon caught up with him, despite the latter's retirement after the tour. During Bradman's testimonial match, Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at his retired captain, dismissing him with the last of these and drawing an angry look. Bradman was one of three members of the national selection panel, and Miller was dropped for the next series against South Africa in 1949–50. Although Bradman denied voting for the omission, most of the players in the team did not believe this."

        "text": "Christopher Raymond Lambert (born March 8, 1983) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers and Baltimore Orioles.\nHigh school and college.\nAlthough born in California, Lambert moved to Manchester, New Hampshire, where he attended Manchester Memorial High School. Lambert initially planned to attend Holderness School, but while playing American Legion baseball the summer out of high school his 90–95 mph fastball attracted attention from college recruiters. With offers from Florida State University, Clemson, LSU and Boston College, Lambert opted for Boston College, praising its \"great academic reputation\", \"very good baseball program\" and its closeness to Manchester. Lambert started at BC in early 2002, and immediately made a strong impression, going 9–3 with a 2.76 ERA. The Big East conference named him \"Rookie of the Year\" and \"Pitcher of the Year\", while Baseball America granted him \"Freshman All-America honors.\" In the summer of 2002, Lambert pitched for the Concord Quarry Dogs of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, going 3–2 with a 1.55 ERA in nine appearances. Lambert remained strong for the 2002-2003 academic year, posting an 8–2 record with a 2.71 ERA and continuing to receive accolades. After the 2003 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Lambert returned to Boston College for a third year, going 6–4 with a 3.02 ERA. Impressed, the St. Louis Cardinals selected Lambert as their No. 1 draft pick, 19th pick overall.\nProfessional career.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cardinals assigned Lambert to the Single-A Peoria Chiefs in the Midwest League and began playing immediately, posting a 1–1 record with an ERA of 2.38 in nine starts. Promoted to the Single-A Palm Beach Cardinals for the 2005 season he continued to dominate, going 7–1 with a 2.63 ERA in ten starts and earning a quick promotion to the Double-A Springfield Cardinals in the Texas League. The transition to Double-A baseball proved difficult; Lambert went 3–8 with a 6.35 ERA. In an interview, Lambert admitted that he \"hadn't pitched that well, yet.\" A bright spot came at the end of the year when he was named to the United States national baseball team.\nLambert returned to Double-A for the 2006 season and showed improvement, posting a winning record (10–9) and a lowered ERA of 5.30. Lambert made a single appearance at the end of the season with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds, but was tagged for a loss, giving up three runs in four innings. After stints in spring training and minor league camp to open the 2007 season, Lambert was back in Springfield again. After a strong start, however, the Cardinals promoted him to Memphis, this time for good. However, for the first time, Lambert would be working out of the bullpen: after years in the minors, he was no longer the power pitcher he had been in college. Lambert was philosophical about the change: \"I guess that's just the way they thought I'd get to the big leagues. I've had my good innings and bad innings.\" Lambert would not, however, reach the majors with the Cardinals; on August 30, 2007, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers as the player to be named later to complete the deal which sent pitcher Mike Maroth to the Cardinals. The Tigers assigned Lambert to the Toledo Mud Hens, their Triple-A club.\nDetroit Tigers.\nLambert's time as a relief pitcher for Memphis had not been a success: in 28 appearances he was 1–4 with an ERA of 7.49. The Tigers, accordingly, returned Lambert to a starting role. He made one start at the tail end of the 2007 season; a six-inning performance in which he allowed just one hit while striking out ten. The Tigers invited Lambert to 2008 spring training, but he did not make the major league cut and returned to Toledo, where he went 5–3 with an ERA of 3.37 in his first 12 starts. On August 23, the Tigers announced their intention to recall Lambert to start on the 26th in place of the struggling Nate Robertson. Lambert made his first major league debut for the Tigers on August 26, against the Cleveland Indians. He struck out the first batter he faced, Indians outfielder Grady Sizemore, but would end up going 2-1, with an ERA of 5.66 to finish out the year.\nLambert was designated for assignment August 18, 2009.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nLambert was claimed off waivers by Baltimore August 20, 2009. He would appear in four major-league games with Baltimore at the end of that season, pitching a total of innings, all in relief. His contract was not renewed for the following season, and he did not return to the minor leagues, so that his professional baseball career ended after 2009."

Due to the low population of the islands (under 4,000), the islands do not have a proper league system, and games are played on an informal basis. Many teams are from the British military, and occasionally games would be played against visiting ships in past times.\nIn 1939, a group called the \"Tabaris Highlanders\" arrived on the islands for a brief two months. They were from the Anglo-Argentine community, and were supposed to defend the islands from a German attack during World War II, and were enrolled into the FIDF. Many of this group were rugby players, including Cpl Thomas Dawson Sanderson, who was president of a rugby club.\nFalkland Islands rugby is relatively isolated geographically and is not integrated into South America, or the Confederación Sudamericana de Rugby, which is the continental rugby body.

        "text": "The 2010–11 UEFA Champions League was the 56th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 19th under the UEFA Champions League format. The final was held at Wembley Stadium in London on 28 May 2011, where Barcelona defeated Manchester United 3–1.\nInternazionale were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Schalke 04 in the quarter-finals. As winners, Barcelona earned berths in the 2011 UEFA Super Cup and the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 76 teams participated in the 2010–11 Champions League, from 52 UEFA associations (Liechtenstein organised no domestic league competition). Associations were allocated places according to their 2009 UEFA country coefficient, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2004–05 to 2008–09.\nBelow is the qualification scheme for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League:\nDistribution.\nSince the winners of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, Internazionale, obtained a place in the group stage through their domestic league placing, the reserved title holder spot in the group stage was effectively vacated. To compensate:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season shown in parentheses.\nTH Title Holder\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless stated otherwise.\nSeeding.\nThe draws for the qualifying rounds, the play-off round and the group stage were all seeded based on the 2010 UEFA club coefficients. The coefficients were calculated on the basis of a combination of 20% of the value of the respective national association's coefficient for the period from 2005–06 to 2009–10 inclusive and the clubs' individual performances in the UEFA club competitions during the same period. Clubs were ordered by their coefficients and then divided into pots as required.\nIn the draws for the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, the teams were divided evenly into one seeded and one unseeded pot, based on their club coefficients. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie also being decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. The seeding in each draw was carried out under the assumption that all of the highest-ranked clubs of the previous round were victorious. If a lower-ranked club was victorious, it simply took the place of its defeated opponent in the next round. Moreover, in the third qualifying round and play-off round, champion clubs and non-champion clubs were kept separated. Prior to these draws, UEFA could form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition, while ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other.\nIn the draw for the group stage, the 32 teams were split into four pots of eight teams, based on their club coefficients, with the title holder automatically placed into Pot 1. Each group contained one team from each pot, but teams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group. The draw was controlled in order to split teams of the same national association evenly between Groups A-D and Groups E-H, where the two sets of groups alternated between playing on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for each matchday.\nIn the draw for the first knockout round, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight group runners-up were unseeded. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the seeded team hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn with each other.\nQualifying rounds.\nIn the qualifying and play-off rounds, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis.\nThe draws for the first two qualifying rounds were held on 21 June 2010 by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and Michael Heselschwerdt, Head of Club Competitions, while the draw for the third qualifying round was held on 16 July 2010 by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and Giorgio Marchetti, Competitions Director.\nFirst qualifying round.\nThe first legs were planned to be played on 29 and 30 June, and the second legs were played on 6 and 7 July 2010. However, the first match of the entire competition (FC Santa Coloma v Birkirkara on 29 June) was cancelled due to the pitch being declared unfit.\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe first legs were played on 13 and 14 July, and the second legs were played on 20 and 21 July 2010.\nThird qualifying round.\nThe third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: one for champions and one for non-champions. The losing teams in both sections entered the play-off round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. The first legs were played on 27 and 28 July, and the second legs were played on 3 and 4 August 2010.\nPlay-off round.\nThe draw for the play-off round was held on 6 August 2010 by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and UEFA Competitions Director Giorgio Marchetti. The play-off round was split into two separate sections: one for champions and one for non-champions. The losing teams in both sections entered the group stage of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. The first legs were played on 17 and 18 August, and the second legs were played on 24 and 25 August 2010.\nFollowing a trial at the previous year's UEFA Europa League, UEFA announced that in both the 2010–11 and 2011–12 competitions, two extra officials would be used – with one on each goal line.\nGroup stage.\nThe 32 clubs were drawn into eight groups of four on 26 August 2010 in Monaco. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 14–15 September, 28–29 September, 19–20 October, 2–3 November, 23–24 November, and 7–8 December 2010. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the round of 32 of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria were applied to determine the rankings (in descending order):\nBursaspor, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Braga, Tottenham Hotspur, Twente and Žilina all made their debuts in the group stage. \nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 17 December 2010. The draws for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final (to determine the \"home\" team) were held on 18 March 2011.\nRound of 16.\nThe first legs of the round of 16 were played on 15, 16, 22 and 23 February, and the second legs were played on 8, 9, 15 and 16 March 2011.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first legs were played on 5 and 6 April, and the second legs were played on 12 and 13 April 2011.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first legs were played on 26 and 27 April, and the second legs were played on 3 and 4 May 2011.\nFinal.\nThe 2011 UEFA Champions League final was played on 28 May 2011 at Wembley Stadium in London, England.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.\nPrize money.\nJust for being in the group stage, each club received €3.9 million (compared with €3.8 million last season 2009–2010), followed by €550,000 for each group match they played, or €3.3 million for the whole group stage, giving them each a total of €7.2 million in participation bonuses. In addition, each club had the possibility of netting up to €4.8m in group stage performance bonuses (€800,000 for a win; €400,000 for a draw). Real Madrid CF took the most from this pot, with a near-maximum €4.4 million. A place in the round of 16 was worth €3 million, in the quarter-finals €3.3 million and in the semi-finals €4.2 million. The overall winners, FC Barcelona, received an additional €9 million, bringing their total bonuses to €30.7 million (out of a maximum €31.5 million). Manchester United FC, the runners-up, received a final match bonus of €5.6 million. The second payments category, the market pool, depends primarily on the value of the clubs' domestic markets. If an association is represented by more than one club, however, the clubs' shares are calculated, first, on the basis of their position in the previous season's domestic championship and, second, on the basis of the number of matches they play in the competition (group stage onwards). With €27.023m, Chelsea FC received the largest market pool share of all the clubs in the 2010/11 UEFA Champions League. In addition, the clubs all keep their own gate receipts."

        "title": "Tommy Hughes (baseball)",
        "text": "Thomas Owen Hughes (October 7, 1919 – November 28, 1990) was an American professional baseball player. Born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, he was a right-handed pitcher who appeared in 144 games pitched in the Major Leagues from 1941–42 and 1946–48 for the Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds. Hughes stood tall and weighed .\nDuring his rookie season, on June 3, 1941, Hughes threw a one-hit, 7–0 shutout against the Chicago Cubs, with Lou Novikoff getting the only safety. But his best season came in 1942, when he appeared in 40 games, 31 as a starting pitcher, and set a career high in wins (12) and innings pitched (253), and notched a low 3.06 earned run average. However, with a last-place Phillies team behind him, he lost 18 games, also a career high. Hughes then spent three full seasons (1943–1945) in the United States Army during World War II.\nPitching for second-division National League teams that never won more than 65 games in any of his five seasons, Hughes never recorded a .500 winning percentage in the Majors. In 144 games, 87 as a starter, and 688 innings pitched, he gave up 698 hits and 308 bases on balls, with 221 strikeouts, 31 complete games, and five shutouts.\nPro career.\nHughes made his pro debut for the old Baltimore Orioles of the International League. Playing under the legendary Rogers Hornsby, Hughes did not earn a win and finished 0-2 after appearing in seven games at the age of nineteen. That season he also played for Dover of the Eastern Shore League. Playing on the D-League level, Hughes went 9-0 with a 1.80 ERA. The next season, he played the entire year with Baltimore, finishing with a 14-11 record. The next season he made the Orioles parent club, the Philadelphia Phillies. In his rookie season, Hughes went 9-14 with a 4.45 ERA. He earned his first major league victory on April 22, 1941. Coming in relief for starter Si Johnson, who'd pitched 11 innings, Hughes walked two batters and gave up one hit, and struck out one in just one inning of work. Hughes struggle a bit in his rookie season. He finished with nine wins, fourteen losses and an E.R.A. of 4.45. He bounced back with a strong outing in 1942. Hughes went 12-18, despite not recording his first win until May 10, a 4-3 win over the Boston Braves in which Hughes went the distance, giving up three runs on six hits in nine innings. It would be a month, June 16 to be exact, before Hughes earned his next win, a 3-2 win over the Cincinnati Reds, as Hughes out dueled Reds ace Johnny Vander Meer.\nHughes missed the next three seasons serving in the military during World War II, as did many major leaguers. In 1946, Hughes appeared in 29 games for the Phillies. Once again, Hughes lost his first several decisions before picking up his first win in June to put him at 1-6. When the season was over, Hughes was 6-9. In 1947, the pattern repeated for Hughes, losing his first several decisions, though he did earn a save in Philadelphia's 8-4 win over Cincinnati. On July 14, Hughes earned his final win as a member of the Philles, a 5-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. Hughes went the distance, pitching all nine innings, giving up only six hits, and holding Cardinals stars like Enos Slaughter and Marty Marion hitless. Hughes struck out three and gave up a home run to Cardinals third baseman Whitey Kurowski\nAt the end of the 1947 season, the Phillies traded Hughes to the Cincinnari reds for journeyman utility player Bert Haas. Hughes' time in Cincinnati saw him not only go 0-4, but the Reds were 0-12 in games in which Hughes appeared. Hughes made his last major league appearance on July 14, 1948. He worked one inning and gave up five hits and allowed four runs. Starter Ken Peterson, who only last two innings, gave up five runs, as did Walker Cress, who relieved Hughes after Hughes' one inning of work. The Giants crushed the Reds 14-2.\nIn 1948, Hughes also pitched for the Syracuse Chiefs, the triple A affiliate of the Reds. He spent all of 1949 pitching for the Tulsa Oilers of the Texas League. Hughes was not re-signed by the Reds at the end of the year, ending his career as a baseball player.\nMilitary service and post-baseball life.\nHughes enlisted in the military on December 19, 1942. During his military career, Hughes served as a Private, First Class (PFC for short). Based at the New Cumberland Reception Center, Hughes played for the camp's baseball team. he was the teams ace, earning wins over the stronger military teams. By the end of the season, Hughes was 14-3. He was assigned to Camp Siebert, located in Alabama. While stationed there, Hughes pitched for the military baseball team. In 1945, he was assigned to Camp Patrick Henry, located in Virginia. While keeping up with his military duties, Hughes found time to play for that camp's baseball squad as well.\nAfter his military service and baseball career were both over, Hughes returned home. He served as the director of baseball fields for the city of Wilkes-Barre. In 1953, he was a coach for the Eastern league's Wilkes-Barre Barons. He was active for a few games, but did not appear in any of them."

        "text": "The men's marathon 10 kilometre event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 21 August at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park in Beijing, China.\nDutch swimmer and cancer survivor Maarten van der Weijden enjoyed the race of his life as he sprinted in a three-way battle against Great Britain's David Davies and Germany's Thomas Lurz to a spectacular finish under a scorching rain, and most importantly, to claim the Olympic title in the inaugural men's open water marathon. With only a few hundred metres left, he pulled ahead from the rest of the field before slapping the yellow pads first in 1:51:51.6. Van der Weijden was diagnosed with leukemia in 2001; however, with the aid of a stem cell treatment, he came back stronger from a two-year ordeal to resume his swimming career.\nLeading almost the entire race by over six body lengths, Davies drifted offline at the final stages, and eventually missed out the title by 1.5 seconds with the silver-medal time in 1:51:53.1. Meanwhile, Lurz held off the final pack to claim the bronze in 1:51:53.6, finishing exactly two seconds behind Van der Weijden.\nFarther from the trio, Italy's Valerio Cleri finished off the podium with a fourth-place time in 1:52:07.5, and was followed in fifth by Russia's Evgeny Drattsev at 1:52:08.9. Bulgaria's Petar Stoychev, the English Channel record holder, trailed behind his Russian rival in a sprint challenge by two-tenths of a second (0.20), earning a sixth spot in 1:52:09.1. Belgium's Brian Ryckeman (1:52:10.7) and U.S. swimmer Mark Warkentin (1:52:13.0) managed to pull off from the rest of the field with a top-eight finish.\nRussia's pre-Olympic favorite and world champion Vladimir Dyatchin was disqualified from the race after he received a pair of yellow cards for obstructing his fellow swimmers and a red card for misconduct.\nQualification.\nThe men's 10 km races at the 2008 Olympics featured a field of twenty-five swimmers:\nCompetition format.\nUnlike all of the other swimming events in the pool, the men's and women's marathon 10 kilometre races were held in open water. No preliminary heats were held, with only the single mass-start race being contested. This race is held using freestyle swimming, with a lack of stroke regulations. For most of the event swimmers use the front crawl, but modifications are used situationally, especially when swimmers reach feeding stations.\nOpen water swimming events require different tactics and showcase several different racing strategies that are more common to competitive cycling, marathon running and water polo than traditional pool swimming. It is one of the few Olympic sports where the athlete's coaches play a critical role during the actual event. The coaches have four opportunities to provide drinks to their athletes as the athletes swim by floating pontoons in the course. If the coach falls in the water, his or her athlete is immediately disqualified."

        "text": "Joseph Henry Thomas (March 18, 1921 – February 10, 1983) was a National Football League (NFL) general manager and also served as the head coach of the Baltimore Colts for part of the 1974 season.\nMinnesota Vikings and Miami Dolphins.\nThomas was director of player personnel for the Minnesota Vikings (1960–65) and the Miami Dolphins from 1965 until his contract dispute with team owner Joe Robbie culminated with his resignation on February 22, 1972. He was succeeded by Bobby Beathard three days later. The Dolphins won the subsequent two Super Bowls.\nBaltimore Colts.\nThomas arranged for Robert Irsay to purchase the Los Angeles Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves for $19 million before exchanging them for Carroll Rosenbloom's Baltimore Colts in an unprecedented transaction which was completed on July 13, 1972. He became general manager of the Colts, succeeding Don Klosterman who transitioned to the Rams in a similar capacity. \nWhen the ballclub opened 1972 at 1–4, he fired head coach Don McCafferty on October 16 and replaced him with defensive line coach John Sandusky who was ordered by Thomas to start younger players over the veterans. The result was Johnny Unitas being benched for the remainder of the season in favor of Marty Domres. After the 5–9 Colts finished its first losing campaign in sixteen years, he dismissed Sandusky and his entire coaching staff on December 20.\nHe was reunited with Dolphins offensive coordinator Howard Schnellenberger who was named as Sandusky's successor eight weeks later on February 14, 1973. When the Colts went 4–13 over parts of two seasons with Schnellenberger at the helm, Thomas was named to replace him by Irsay following a 30–10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at Veterans Stadium on September 29, 1974. Irsay had first gone to the press box to inform Thomas that he was the new head coach and then to the locker room to announce his actions to the Colts players before breaking the news to Schnellenberger in a heated discussion in the coaches office.\nWeeks prior to hiring Schnellenberger, Thomas purged the team of its veteran players, beginning with trading Unitas to the San Diego Chargers on January 22, 1973. Within the next ten days, Tom Matte would follow Unitas to San Diego, Bill Curry was sent to the Houston Oilers, Billy Newsome to the New Orleans Saints, Norm Bulaich to the Philadelphia Eagles and Jerry Logan to the Rams. The Newsome deal brought to the Colts the second overall selection in the 1973 NFL Draft which was used to pick Bert Jones. In that draft and the one the following year, Thomas would also select a pair of blind-side offensive linemen in David Taylor and Robert Pratt and an entire defensive line of Joe Ehrmann, Mike Barnes, John Dutton and Fred Cook.\nAfter the Colts qualified for the NFL playoffs by winning the AFC East title in each of two consecutive seasons in 1975 and 1976, Thomas lost a power struggle over player personnel decisions to head coach Ted Marchibroda and was fired by Irsay on January 21, 1977. The Colts had five different head coaches during Thomas' five-year tenure, one of whom was himself.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nThomas then was hired as GM of the San Francisco 49ers in 1977 by new owner Eddie DeBartolo at the recommendation of Al Davis and immediately fired head coach Monte Clark. The 49ers went 7–23 in his two seasons with the franchise, and his biggest trade, a series of five high draft picks for O. J. Simpson. He also fired two more head coaches, Ken Meyer and Pete McCulley (and made 14 total roster changes). Thomas and his third 49ers head coach Fred O'Connor were dismissed on January 8, 1979, one day prior to Bill Walsh succeeding the latter.\nPersonal life.\nThomas married the former Judi Demian in 1969. They had a daughter, Paige, in June 1970.\nThomas died on February 10, 1983, at the age of 61. He was living in Miami and was VP of the Miami Dolphins at the time of his death."

The World Tour was introduced 1989 for men and in 1992 for women being held yearly since then until 2021 when it was replaced by the new Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour.\nSeveral tournaments were staged throughout the year. All athletes who competed in the qualifying and main draws of the tournaments earned points in the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Rankings, and after the last stage the pair that accumulated the most points during the year was declared the champion of the World Tour (only points from 75% of the tournaments in the season were considered for the ranking).

        "text": "The 2008–09 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, in the 2008–09 season. It ran alongside the 2008–09 Top 14 competition; both competitions were operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nPrevious season.\nAt the end of the previous season, Toulon were champions and thus automatically promoted to Top 14. They were eventually followed by Mont-de-Marsan, who beat Racing Métro in extra time in the final providing the second promotion place. Blagnac, which had been newly promoted to Pro D2 for the 2007–08 season, finished bottom of the table and were initially relegated to Fédérale 1, but were further relegated by French sporting authorities to Fédérale 2 due to financial problems. Limoges finished second-from-bottom for the second consecutive year; unlike 2006–07, when Limoges were reprieved when Gaillac were denied a professional license due to financial issues, they received no such break in 2007–08. The other promoted team in 2007–08, Aurillac, stayed up, finishing in 11th.\nColomiers and Bourg-en-Bresse earned promotion from Fédérale 1 for the 2008–09 season, while Albi and Auch were relegated from the 2007–08 Top 14.\n2008–09 synopsis.\nRacing Métro, which had barely missed out on promotion the previous season, easily won the title, clinching with three rounds to spare. The three promotion playoff games were decided by a total of 5 points, with the semifinal between Albi and La Rochelle being tied after extra time and decided on the third step of the tiebreaker, penalties scored during the match. Albi ultimately defeated Oyonnax in the final to secure an immediate return to the Top 14.\nThe two newly promoted teams, Colomiers and Bourg-en-Bresse, were in relegation trouble throughout the season, but Colomiers escaped, finishing in 14th, the last safe spot. Bourg-en-Bresse were provisionally joined in relegation by Béziers.\nHowever, this did not end the relegation saga. In order to keep a professional license and stay in Pro D2, all clubs must pass a postseason audit conducted by DNACG (\"Direction nationale d'aide et de contrôle de gestion\"), the LNR's financial arm. On June 12, DNACG announced that Tarbes and Bourg-en-Bresse had failed their audits and would be relegated. Tarbes would be relegated to Fédérale 1, while Bourg-en-Bresse, already consigned to Fédérale 1, would face a further drop to Fédérale 2. Béziers would have been spared the drop if Tarbes had not successfully appealed its relegation. However, Tarbes were able to come up with sufficient financial guarantees to satisfy DNACG, and its relegation to Fédérale 1 was officially rescinded on June 26.\nThe competition.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also makes it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for 2008–09.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nSchedule and results.\nMatches are listed in the following order:\nAll times CET.\nRounds 1 to 5.\nRound 1\nRound 2\nRound 3\nRound 4\nRound 5\nRounds 6 to 10.\nRound 6\nRound 7\nRound 8\nRound 9\nRound 10\nRounds 11 to 15.\nRound 11\nRound 12\nRound 13\nRound 14\nRound 15\nRounds 16 to 20.\nRound 16\nRound 17\nRound 18\nRound 19\nRound 20\nRounds 21 to 25.\nRound 21\nRound 22\nRound 23\nRound 24\nRound 25\nRounds 26 to 30.\nRound 26\nRound 27\nRound 28\nRound 29\nRound 30\nPromotion playoffs.\nAll times CEST."

        "title": "Baylor Bears men's basketball",
        "text": "The Baylor Bears men's basketball team represents Baylor University in Waco, Texas, in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. The Bears compete in the Big 12 Conference. The team played its home games in Ferrell Center from 1988 until 2023. Baylor now plays its home games in the Foster Pavilion and is currently coached by Scott Drew.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nLuther Burleson coached the first basketball team at Baylor in 1907 also doubling as the football coach. In Baylor's second season of basketball then cross-town rival TCU began their program which the Bears defeated twice during the 1908–09 season. Ralph Glaze's (1911–1914) .788 winning percentage ranks at the best all time in school history. Ralph Wolf (1927–1941) led Baylor to its first SWC Championship in 1932 after surviving and overcoming one of the first great tragedies in college athletics in his first season as coach.\nImmortal Ten.\nOn January 22, 1927, Coach Ralph Wolf's Baylor basketball team was traveling by bus to play the University of Texas. As the bus passed through Round Rock, Texas, it approached railroad tracks on the south side of the business district on a drizzly, cloudy day. As the bus crossed the tracks, the occupants failed to hear the sound of the train whistle and ringing bell. The driver caught sight of the train at the last moment and tried to steer away, but the Sunshine Special crashed into the bus at nearly 60 mph tearing off the roof and right side.\nTen Baylor students and basketball players were killed by the impact. One player, James Clyde \"Abe\" Kelly, pushed his friend, Weir Washam, out the window of the bus just moments before the impact, saving Washam's life but costing Kelly his own. The bodies of Kelly and Robert Hailey were found horrifically stretched across the cow-catcher on the front of the train, with arms locked around each other and Kelly missing a leg. Ivy Foster Sr. of Taylor, Texas, had heard of the accident and rushed to the train station in Taylor to meet the train and assist where needed only to find his son among the dead.\nThe deceased were Jack Castellaw, Sam Dillow, Merle Dudley, L. R. \"Ivey\" Foster Jr., Robert \"Bob\" Hailey, James Clyde \"Abe\" Kelly, Willis Murrary, James \"Jim\" Walker, and William Winchester.\nThe remainder of the 1927 season was canceled. The tragedy had reverberations over the entire state and nation and led to the construction of the first railway overpass in Texas where the event occurred at Round Rock. Buses were later required to come to a full stop and open the door at all rail crossings to listen for trains. The Immortal Ten story has been commemorated each year since 1927 at first in Chapel services then later at the Freshman Mass meeting during Homecoming Week. In 2007, the event was also memorialized in bronze on the Baylor campus in Traditions Plaza.\nOn the 90th anniversary of the tragedy, January 22, 2017, the City of Round Rock held a memorial event to remember those who were killed in the train-bus collision. At the event, the city dedicated the \"Immortal Bridge,\" which arcs over the railroad tracks where the accident occurred. Green lampposts, green-and-gold striping and other markings were added to honor the 10 students who were killed there. The event was open to the public, and attendees included Baylor administrators and student leaders, the spirit squads, and Baylor's Golden Wave Band.\nPost-World War II success.\nBaylor men's teams won five conference championships in the former Southwest Conference (1932, 1946, 1948, 1949*, 1950*; * denotes shared title). The Bears reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 1946, and reached the Final Four in 1948 and 1950. Bill Henderson's 1948 team advanced to play the Kentucky Wildcats for the NCAA championship, but fell 58–42 to Adolph Rupp's first national championship team. The team again advanced to the NCAA Final Four in 1950 under Henderson losing to the Bradley Braves 68–66. Bill Menefee (1962–1973) would lead the Bears to a national ranking in 1969 but failed to make the postseason that year. Menefee was the only coach over the next 50 years to have a career record of over .500, and would later serve as Baylor's athletic director in the 1980s. Gene Iba's 1988 NCAA Tournament team would be the first NCAA Tournament appearance for the program in 38 years.\n2003 scandal.\nThe men's basketball program was plagued by a scandal in 2003. Patrick Dennehy, a player for the team, was murdered by former teammate Carlton Dotson; then-coach Dave Bliss was forced to resign amidst allegations that he had violated NCAA rules by making financial payments to four players and that he made improper statements to the media characterizing Dennehy as a drug dealer. The school placed itself on probation, limited itself to 7 scholarships for two years and imposed a post-season ban for one year. Additionally, the NCAA further punished the team by initiating a non-conference ban for the 2005–06 season and extending the probationary period during which the school would have limited recruiting privileges.\nRecent resurgence.\nThanks to the scandal, the 2005 Bears were hindered by only having 7 scholarship players and recorded only one win in conference play. From 2003 to 2007, the Bears would only win a total of 36 games. In spite of these challenges, head coach Scott Drew was able to put together a 2005 signing class ranked No. 7 nationally by HoopScoop.\nHowever, Drew engineered a very quick return to respectability. In 2008, the Bears reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 20 years with a 9–7 conference record and the team's first national ranking in 39 years. The January 23, 2008 116–110 5OT win over Texas A&amp;M at College Station officially became the longest game in Big 12 history. The 2008–09 team again was ranked early in the season but stumbled to a 5–11 conference finish before heating up in the Big 12 Tournament defeating both Kansas and Texas en route to the championship game versus Missouri, and lost by a score of 73–60. The 2008–09 team recorded the program's first postseason victory since 1950 in its first round NIT victory over the Georgetown Hoyas in Waco.\nThe 2008–09 team went on to advance to the NIT Final where they fell to Penn State. The 2009–10 squad was again ranked in both polls and pulled off the biggest road win in school history over the then #6 Texas Longhorns in Austin 80–77 on Jan. 30th. The Bears closed out the season with a Big 12 era best 11–5 record and #3 seed in the Big 12 Tournament.\nThe 2009–10 team was picked to finish 10th in the Big 12 in the Big 12 Coaches poll due to the graduation of several key players from the previous year. However, the team finished the regular season 23–6 and tied for 2nd in the Big 12 standings. Following a 2–1 record at the Big 12 tournament, the Bears were rewarded with a #3 seed in the South Region of the NCAA Tournament. The Bears defeated #14 seed Sam Houston State 68–59 in First round action and then defeated #11 seed Old Dominion 76–68 in Second round play to advance to the Sweet 16 hosted at Reliant Stadium in Houston. The Bears' Sweet 16 match-up was #10 seed Saint Mary's, which had defeated #2 seed Villanova the previous week to advance to the Sweet 16. The Bears won handily over the Gaels, 72–49, after leading 47–19 at the half. The Elite Eight was also held at Reliant Stadium and the Bears' opponent was the #1 seed Duke Blue Devils, the last #1 seed standing in the NCAA Tournament after the other three #1 seeds (Kansas, Syracuse, and Kentucky) were all defeated by lower seeded teams. In front of a very pro-Baylor crowd of over 47,000, the Bears were defeated by the Duke Blue Devils, 78–71, to end the magical run to the Elite Eight. It was the best season in the Scott Drew era as defined by conference standing, overall ranking, wins, and NCAA Tournament wins. The Bears finished the season ranked #10 in the final ESPN/Coaches poll—the highest ranking in program history at that time.\nThe 2010–11 team started the season ranked 14th (according to the AP Preseason poll). The Bears began 7–0, and rose to 9th in the polls before falling to Gonzaga at a neutral court in Dallas. The team finished 18–13 overall and 7–9 in league play. The highlight of the season was LaceDarius Dunn becoming the Big 12's all-time leading scorer, and a sweep of the series versus ranked Texas A&amp;M. After freshman star Perry Jones III was suspended by the NCAA for six games, the Bears proceeded to lose their first-round game of the Big 12 Tournament against Oklahoma.\nThe 2012 season saw another historic campaign for the Bears as they followed up the 2011 season with another successful conference run which saw the Bears win 30 games and make it to the Big 12 tournament title game, but eventually losing to the Missouri Tigers. The Bears were selected for the NCAA Tournament and made it all the way to the Elite Eight, which ended in a loss to eventual national champion Kentucky.\nThe 2013 season witnesses another winning campaign for the Bears as they followed up the 2012 Elite Eight season with another successful conference run which saw the Bears sweep both TCU and Texas Tech while only dropping one game to UT. The Bears started out with a pre-season ranking of #19 in the country. The Bears finish conference play at .500 and were selected for the NIT tournament. The Bears made it all the way to the final, which ended in a win over Iowa, winning the tournament before a large crowd in Madison Square Garden and claiming the 2013 NIT Title.\nThe 2016–17 season saw one of the best starts in Baylor history, going 15–0 with wins over #4 Oregon, #24 Michigan State, #10 Louisville, and #7 Xavier. On January 9, Baylor would reach AP #1 for the first time in program history, although they would fall to #10 West Virginia that same day. Baylor remained within the top 12 for the remainder of the season and would finish 25–6, 12–6 in conference. They would fall to Iowa State in the first round of the Big 12 Tournament and receive a #3 seed in the 2017 NCAA tournament. Baylor would get to the Sweet Sixteen before being eliminated by South Carolina.\nThe 2019–20 season is considered one of the greatest in program history. They came into the season ranked #16 in the nation, but would fall to #24 after losing to Washington in the Armed Forces Classic. The Bears followed this loss with a 23-game win streak, including 6 ranked victories and a rise to #1 in the country. On January 11, Baylor defeated #3 Kansas on the road, winning in Lawrence for the first time in school history. Baylor's impressive start to the season ended on a sour note, losing 3 of their last 5 games before the Big 12 tournament. Baylor would finish the regular season 26–4 with a 15–3 conference mark, the most wins they had recorded in conference play, and remained ranked within the top 5 for the back half of the season. The NCAA Tournament would be canceled amid the COVID-19 pandemic, however numerous bracketologist considered the Bears as a 1-seed and had the potential to reach the Final Four. \nIn 2021, with the Bears’ help of soon-to-be consensus All-American Jared Butler, Baylor defeated Hartford, Wisconsin, Villanova, and Arkansas to reach their first Final Four since 1950, where they defeated the in-state Houston Cougars, to reach the NCAA championship, where they defeated Gonzaga, winning their first title in school history, and spoiling the Bulldogs’ then-perfect season in the process.\nFacilities.\nIn its early days, Marrs McLean Gym was Baylor’s basketball home, and doubled as the site of many physical education classes. Marrs McLean Gymnasium was built in 1938 and still stands on campus today.\nThe Heart O' Texas Fair Complex, now known as the Extraco Events Center, is located in Waco, Texas. It was once the prime basketball facility for Baylor University and was used from 1953 to 1988. The H.O.T Coliseum was constructed after McLennan County voters authorized a bond issue of $1.2 million in the early 1950s.\nStarting in 1988, the Bears played their home games at the Ferrell Center, adjacent to the Brazos River. It is named for Charles R. Ferrell, a Baylor student and legacy who died in 1967, and whose family's estate was a major benefactor of the arena. The main arena, Paul J. Meyer Arena, seats 10,284 people.\nBaylor began construction on the Foster Pavilion, where both the men's and women's team would play their home games. \nThe first game is January 2, 2024 versus Cornell.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Bears have appeared in the NCAA tournament 16 times. Their combined record is 22–15. They were National Champions in 2021.\nNIT results.\nThe Bears have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) six times. Their combined record is 10–5.

The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 29–9 (12–6) record, while making it to the Championship Game of the NCAA tournament.\nThe team was led by seniors John Wallace and Lazarus Sims. Fellow senior J.B. Reafsnyder, juniors Jason Cipolla and Otis Hill, sophomore Todd Burgan and Marius Janulis played key roles. Walk-on and future NFL star Donovan McNabb also appeared in five games.\nSeason recap.\nSyracuse was aided by the return of John Wallace, who had declared for the NBA draft, but chose to withdraw his early entry. Wallace would lead Syracuse in scoring for 30-of-38 games, leading Syracuse to an early 11–0 record.\nWith the Orangemen hitting a bump in mid-season losing five of eight Big East games, Boeheim chose to insert Jason Cipolla into the starting lineup in favor of Marius Janulis. The move worked as Syracuse would go 8–1 to finish the regular season with a record of 22–7. Syracuse would advance to the Big East tournament semifinals, where it was knocked off by Connecticut, 85–67.\nSyracuse was named a No. 4 seed for the tournament, and played one of its most memorable games in the Sweet 16 against Georgia. Cipolla hit a jumper as time expired in regulation to send the game to overtime, and John Wallace sealed the victory with a 3-pointer with 2 seconds remaining to propel Syracuse to an 83–81 win. Wallace finished with 30 points and 15 rebounds in that game.\nSyracuse would knock off the Paul Pierce, Raef LaFrentz and Jacque Vaughn-led Kansas in the Elite 8, and Erick Dampier and the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the national semifinal game. This set up a matchup between Jim Boeheim and former assistant Rick Pitino, who was now head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats in the National Championship game.\nSyracuse, a heavy underdog, nearly overcame a 13-point second-half deficit, closing to within 2, but Kentucky held on for a 76–67 victory. Kentucky featured a deep team, including future NBA players Derek Anderson, Antoine Walker, Tony Delk and Ron Mercer.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

The company employs the digital signal processing software tool, Max.\nHistory.\nCycling '74 (C74) was founded in 1997 by David Zicarelli to serve as the distributor for his various collections of software. The company's name comes relates to its original web design; Zicarelli used images from a 1974 bicycling catalog (see an early archive of the website).\nC74 began producing the MSP extension to Opcode Systems's 1990 program \"Max\" in the mid 1990s, and in 1998 started distributing the products together. there is no longer a version of Max without audio processing.\nIn June 2017, Ableton announced they had acquired Cycling '74.\nProducts.\nMax.\nC74 is the distributor and developer of the Max/MSP digital signal processing environment. The company has published the program since 1999, and in 2008 released Max 5, a major overhaul. A Sound on Sound article (August 2008) covered its new software GUI. The new interface was designed using Juce. Aside from re-designed graphics, the development of the new system concentrated on the original code base, and provided integrated documentation and debugging. With the release of Max 5, MSP and Jitter were included in the package.\nMSP.\nMSP is a DSP plug-in for Max, allowing realtime audio synthesis.\nJitter.\nJitter is a plug-in for Max released in 2003 that allows realtime manipulation of 3D graphics and video.\nRNBO.\nRNBO is an add-on patching environment in Max that allows users to export patches as portable code that can run in several software and hardware target contexts such as VST3 or Audio Unit plug-ins, as well as Raspberry Pi. RNBO source code can also be integrated into C++ or web audio projects, allowing users to run RNBO patches in the web browser. RNBO was released in 2022.\ngen~.\ngen~ is the low-level signal processing core of Max. gen~ encourages users to continue thinking and patching visually, but with the basic building blocks of algorithms. It is an extension of the Max patching environment, specialized for specific domains such as audio (MSP) and matrix and texture processing with Jitter. gen~ also gives users the flexibility to use concise text based expression language (known as \"codebox\" in Max) rather than the default visual programming language.\nPluggo.\nPluggo was a Max extension that provided capabilities for VST design. Pluggo was required to export Max \"patches\" for use in digital audio workstation (DAW) host environments, but was discontinued after the release of Max for Live.\nMax for Live.\nMax was integrated into Ableton Live, developed by Ableton and Cycling ’74, to build unique synths and effects, create algorithmic composition tools, or fuse Live and controller hardware into new music machines. Unlike Pluggo, the device created with Max for Live can be edited directly from Live by pressing the edit button.\nBooks.\nStep-by-Step: Adventures in Sequencing with Max/MSP.\n\"Step-by-Step: Adventures in Sequencing with Max/MSP\" is a book written by Gregory Taylor and released by Cycling '74 in 2018. It is about step-based sequencing tools and how to build them using Max. The book aims to demystify and humanize the process of building and iterating upon step-sequencers and patching processes within Max. Cycling '74 also published a Japanese translation of the book.\nGenerating Sound and Organizing Time: Thinking with gen~ Book 1.\n\"Generating Sound &amp; Organizing Time – Thinking with gen~ Book 1\" is a book about gen~ written by Graham Wakefield and Gregory Taylor and released by Cycling '74 in 2022. The book aims to encourage working with audio at the sample-by-sample level and demystify digital audio signal processing, as well as provide greater frameworks for thinking about audio in terms of design patterns, techniques, and subcircuits. The book comes with downloadable gen~ patches that go with each example so that readers can hear the results in real time. \nRecord Label.\nFounded in 2000, c74 Music was created to release music produced using Cycling '74 technology. The same year, the label released its first record - a live compilation album by the Freight Elevator Quartet. The artist roster is:"

Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score.

        "text": "Roger Farrell Erickson (born August 30, 1956) is a retired American professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball from – for the Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees. Born in Springfield, Illinois, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nCareer.\nErickson was selected by the Twins in the third round of the 1977 amateur draft after pitching for the University of New Orleans. In his first pro season, Erickson put up an 8–4 record and a 1.98 earned run average in Double-A. The following year, he made his major league debut on April 6, 1978, starting and going 6 innings to earn a 5–4 win over the Seattle Mariners. He finished his rookie season with 14 wins and a .519 winning percentage, second highest on the pitching staff.\nHowever, from 1979 through 1981, pitching for a succession of poor Minnesota teams, he went a cumulative 13–31 in 70 games, with an ERA of 4.10. In , he began the year by posting a 4–3 (4.87) record in seven starts. Then he was traded along with Butch Wynegar to the Yankees for Larry Milbourne, John Pacella and Pete Filson on May 12. The defending American League champion Bombers were experiencing a bumpy defense of their title, employing five pitching coaches and winning only 79 games all season. Erickson worked in only 16 games for New York, then went on the injured list with a sore shoulder. He returned to the active roster in , but pitched in only five games, all in relief, for the Yanks in early and late-season trials, spending the bulk of the year at Triple-A. On September 26, 1983, Erickson hurled 2 innings in middle relief against the Cleveland Indians, and allowed four earned runs on three hits and three bases on balls. It was his last MLB appearance. He was traded to the Kansas City Royals during the off-season but was released without making the varsity; he would pitch in the Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals systems, as well as with unaffiliated minor-league teams in the California and Mexican Leagues, before leaving pro ball in 1987.\nErickson posted a 35–53 career record and a 4.13 earned run average, with 24 complete games in 117 starts and one save coming out of the bullpen. In 135 career games and 799 innings pitched, he allowed 868 hits and 251 walks, with 365 strikeouts."

        "text": "The Pittsburgh Keystones were a semi-professional ice hockey club, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was a member of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, the first league to openly hire hockey players, from 1900–1904. The team played all of its games at the Duquesne Garden, and was involved in allowing Harry Peel become the first admitted professional hockey player in 1902.\nHistory.\nThe Keystones' history can be traced to the Keystone Bicycle Club, which was organized in 1879. The bicycle club attempted to branch into hockey in 1899 when it applied to be the new member of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, which was expanding from three to four teams. Although the Pittsburgh Bankers were admitted instead, the Keystone club had only to wait another year before the Western University of Pennsylvania withdrew from the league, allowing the Keystones to fill the vacancy. In forming its team the Keystones heavily recruited from Canada, a practice that was soon copied by the other teams in the WPHL.\nThe Keystone club made an auspicious debut by beating the two-time defending champion Pittsburgh Athletic Club in the opening game of the WPHL's 1900–01 season. Keystone continually strengthened its team during the season but finished second to the PAC, which did not lose another league game on its way to a third consecutive title. Aside from league play, the WPHL teams also played exhibition games against some of the best amateur teams from North America.\nDuring the 1901–02 season, goaltender Riley Hern, a future member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, began his professional career with the Keystones. In his first season, Hern led the league in victories, with nine in 14 games and was named to the WPHL All-Star Team. Joining Hern on the team in 1901 was Arthur Sixsmith who moved to Pittsburgh and turned professional with the Keystones. The Keystones went on to win the 1901–02 WPHL championship title, finally ending the reign of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. However, the Keystones reversed their fortunes in the following season, with a last-place finish and with Hern this time leading the league in losses.\nFirst admitted professional player.\nIn the summer of 1902 Harry Peel, a Keystones player in 1901–02, admitted that he was paid $35 a week to play in the so-called amateur league and so no amateur teams would play against these teams again without being suspended by either Canadian or U.S. officials. According to Peel \"[The Keystones] make no bones whatever about paying men. If they do not pay them, they give them fake positions.\" Peel was later suspended by the Ontario Hockey Association and his appeal was rejected on December 10, 1903 and again on November 30, 1904. However, by the 1902–03 season the WPHL was known as a fully professional league.\nDecline.\nThe next season, the Portage Lakes Hockey Club of Houghton, Michigan began a professional league which continued to play professional exhibition game against the WPHL's Pittsburgh Bankers. However the exposure given by playing Portage Lakes raised the profiles of some of the Pittsburgh players, who were lured away after the season for the promise of better pay in Michigan. The team soon raided Pittsburgh’s teams for top players like Riley Hern and Bruce Stuart. This led the Keystones to withdraw from the league on January 17, 1904. Their players were then redistributed among the three other WPHL teams.\nProminent Players.\nKeystones players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame:"

Qualification was based on UCI ranking by nations, 2008 UCI BMX World Championships results and wild-cards reserved to a \"Tripartite Commission\" (IOC, ANOC, UCI).\nCompetition format.\nEach of the 32 men competing performed two runs of the course in individual time trials to determine seeding for the knockout rounds. Then, they were grouped into 4 quarterfinal groups based on that seeding. Each quarterfinal consisted of three runs of the course, using a point-for-place system. The top four cyclists in each quarterfinal (for a total of 16) moved on to the semifinals. The semifinals also used a three-race point-for-place system to determine which cyclists advanced, with the top four in each of the two semifinals moving on to the final.

Italy confirmed their place in the quarter-finals, beating El Salvador 4–1 and taking themselves up to 6 points. In Italy's final game they went down 3–0 to Portugal. Italy battled back and took it into extra time at 4–4. It looked to be heading for penalties but a last minute goal by Madjer meant Portugal won the game and the group.\nAs Italy were the runners-up of group B, they met the winners of group A, France in the quarter-finals. As France were the hosts they were the favorites to reach the semi-finals. Surprisingly, Italy went up 5–0. France did all they could to get back into the game but Italy held out. With the final score at 5–2 they moved into the semi-finals against Spain.\nThe semi-final was a different battle. Italy were 1–0 down after just 2 minutes. However 2 goals in 2 minutes meant Italy went ahead for the first time. Again Spain looked threatening bringing it back to 2–2 and 10 minutes later, 3–2. The scoreline continued to change and by the end of normal time the score was 4–4. Extra time was uneventful which meant penalties. Amarelle stepped up and hit the post which meant it was all down to Massimiliano Esposito to finish the job. His first attempt was saved but it had to be re-taken. Esposito hit the ball down the center and sent Italy into the final to face Brazil.\nBrazil.\nBrazil started their world cup campaign as defending champions, in group D, coming from behind to win by 3 goals to 2 against Spain.

It was an epic semi-final, although Brazil were always finding themselves having to come from behind. In the 34th minute, Bruno hit a long range shot finding the back of the net sending Brazil into the final. Portugal failed to come back in the final 2 minutes leaving Brazil to win 5–4."

        "title": "US Open of Surfing",
        "text": "The U.S. Open of Surfing is a week-long surfing competition held annually during the summer in Huntington Beach, California. Generally held on the south side of the Huntington Beach Pier, the U.S. Open is part of the qualification process for the World Surf League and is a WSL QS 10,000 event. It is the largest surfing competition in the world. It has been owned by IMG since 2000.\nAs part of the event, notable people in the world of surfing are added to the Surfing Walk of Fame and to the Surfers' Hall of Fame, both directly across from the pier.\nHistory.\nThe U.S. Open, then called the West Coast Surfing Championship, was first held in 1959. In 1964 it became known as the United States Surfing Championships. In 1982 it became known as the OP Pro for its sponsor, Ocean Pacific. The event was renamed the U.S. Open of Surfing in 1994.\nThe contest was traditionally held during Labor Day weekend. The event was changed to an earlier date following the 1986 event when riots occurred at the OP Pro.\nRioting again marred the 2013 U.S. Open. On the final day of the event, as the crowds left the contest area and filled Main Street, a civil disturbance erupted, resulting in property damage and several arrests and some injuries. As a result, the event owner IMG stated that in 2014 it will discontinue events such as free concerts and focus more on the sport.\nSpending at the nine-day event adds $21.5 million to the Orange County economy and $16.4 million in Huntington Beach. It is attended by nearly 500,000 people.\nChampions.\nWest Coast Surfing Champions.\n1959: Jack Haley, Linda Benson\n1960: Mike Haley, Linda Benson\n1961: Ron Sizemore, Linda Benson\n1962: Ilima Kalama, Gudie Wilkie\n1963: LJ Richards, Candy Calhoun\nUnited States Surfing Champions.\n1964: Jim Craig, Linda Benson\n1965: Mark Martinson, Joyce Hoffman\n1966: Corky Carroll, Joyce Hoffman\n1967: Corky Carroll, Joyce Hoffman\n1968: David Nuuhiwa, Linda Benson\n1969: Corky Carroll, Sharron Weber\n1970: David Nuuhiwa, Joyce Hoffman\n1971: Brad McCaul, Jericho Poppler\n1972: Dale Dobson, Mary Setterholm\nOp Pro Champions.\n1982: Cheyne Horan, Becky Benson\n1983: Tom Curren, Kim Mearig\n1984: Tom Curren, Frieda Zamba\n1985: Mark Occhilupo, Jodie Cooper\n1986: Mark Occhilupo, Frieda Zamba\n1987: Barton Lynch, Wendy Botha\n1988: Tom Curren, Jorja Smith\n1989: Richie Collins, Frieda Zamba\n1990: Todd Holland, Frieda Zamba\n1991: Barton Lynch, Frieda Zamba\n1992: Team USA (Kelly Slater, Richie Collins, Todd Holland, Mike Parsons, Alisa Schwarzstein)\n1993: Sunny Garcia, Kim Mearig\nU.S. Open Champions.\n1994: Shane Beschen, Lisa Andersen\n1995: Rob Machado, Neridah Falconer\n1996: Kelly Slater, Layne Beachley\n1997: Beau Emerton, Rochelle Ballard\n1998: Andy Irons, Layne Beachley\n1999: Shea Lopez, Keala Kennelly\n2000: Sunny Garcia, Tita Tavares\n2001: Rob Machado, Pauline Menczer\n2002: Kalani Robb, Pauline Menczer\n2003: Cory Lopez, Chelsea Georgeson\n2004: Taj Burrow, Chelsea Georgeson\n2005: Andy Irons, Julia Christian\n2006: Rob Machado, Sofia Mulanovich\n2007: C.J.

The league included teams from countries as Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Cyprus and Israel. The most recent league champion is Sigal Prishtina from Kosovo.\nThe purpose of the Balkan International Basketball League is to provide competitive international play for clubs in the Balkans that would otherwise be unable to participate in international basketball. The league achieves this by providing financial support to all participating clubs in order to ease the costs that make international play difficult. Among other milestones, the league is also the first international league of its kind to include teams from Kosovo.\nFormat.\nAfter the 2017–2018 season, the Balkan International Basketball League introduced a new, simplified competition format. Under this format, the competition now typically features a total of between 6 – 8 teams and the tournament is divided into two phases: the regular season, whereby all participating teams will play each other in a double round robin both home and away and following the regular season's conclusion, the first and second placed teams will automatically qualify to the Final Four, whereas the third placed team will have to play the sixth placed team and the fourth will play the fifth at home and away to determine which team will advance to the Final Four. After this, the winning teams will advance to the final four to determined that season's BIBL Balkan League champions.\nAdditionally, at the start of the 2020–2021 season, 12 teams from Israel participated in the league in order to have access to competitive games during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He played in Sydney's New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership as a for the Manly-Warringah and South Sydney clubs. Mooney won the 1976 and 1978 premierships with Manly.\nCareer.\nBorn in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Mooney was a junior winger for Wauchope. He joined South Sydney in 1972. He played three seasons with the Rabbitohs before joining Manly-Warringah in 1975. At the end of the 1976 NSWRFL season Mooney played in Manly's Grand Final-winning side which defeated Parramatta 13–10. He was also the 1976 season's top try-scorer, equal with teammate and Manly's captain Bob Fulton with both scoring 18 tries in the regular season, though Fulton would score another 3 tries in the finals series.\nMooney scored a try in the 1978 NSWRFL season's Grand Final against Cronulla-Sutherland, which was drawn 11-all and had to be re-played just three days later. Manly would go on to win the replay 16-0 though Mooney did not cross for a try. After playing in Manly's premiership team, Mooney was considered unlucky not to gain a place on the 1978 Kangaroo Tour. Seven of his teammates did tour, as did Manly coach Frank Stanton who was the head coach of the Kangaroos.\nTom Mooney would also go on to be the 1979 NSWRFL season's top try scorer.\nIn 1990 Mooney was named on the wing in a Manly team made up of the best players in the club's history. He was one of the few exceptional players that failed to represent either his state or country.\nFormer Manly teammate Paul \"Fatty\" Vautin told in his biography \"\"The Strife and Times of Paul Vautin\" that during the 1981 NSWRFL season, Mooney was considered to be in a form slump after not having scored a try in the first six games of the season (of which Manly had only won two). Before Manly's Round 7 match against South Sydney at Manly's home ground Brookvale Oval, a fired up Mooney all but ordered teammates to get him the ball during the game. Mooney went on to score two tries as the Sea Eagles won 21–13. Ironically it would be another 10 games before he crossed for another try. He scored a total of 9 tries for the season and retired from playing at the end of the year."

        "title": "Malaysian All-Star League Baseball",
        "text": "Malaysian All-Star League Baseball (MALB) is a baseball league open to all baseball clubs and associations in Malaysia. The league's operations and management are modeled on the US major leagues (MLB). It is the only sports league in the world that has men and women playing side by side, and against each other.\nBaseball development in Malaysia and in the South East Asian region.\nBaseball was introduced to Malaysia in the mid-1970s when several US based corporations, including Texas Instruments and Smith Kline Beecham, began manufacturing operations in the Keramat Industrial Park in Kuala Lumpur. Most of the plants in operation at the time had a substantial number of American expatriates attached to them, who formally introduced baseball to the Malaysian locals through slow-pitch, fast-pitch and rounder games.\nSoftball was introduced to Malaysia in the early 1980s, but the game spread more rapidly than baseball, becoming popular in the northern regions of Pulau Pinang, Kedah and Perak, the southern regions of Johor, Melaka and Negeri Sembilan, the eastern regions of Sabah &amp; Sarawak and the East Coast regions of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang. It was only in 2001 that baseball formed the Persatuan Besbol Amatur Malaysia, or the Amateur Baseball Association of Malaysia, was formed under founding President Dato' Noh Abdullah.\nMALB History.\nThe idea of creating a formal baseball league in Malaysia was first conceptualized in 2005 by two clubs based in Kuala Lumpur, the All-Stars Baseball Club and the Selayang Stars Baseball Club. A formal league was envisioned as a way to provide serious baseball players in Malaysia the opportunity to compete at a more professional level.\nThe inaugural MALB game was held on February 23, 2006 between Selayang Stars and the Aces of Kepong at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia’s field in Bangi. An inaugural five-month season ensued using a double round-robin format, followed by playoffs. The Patriots Baseball Club, based in Bangsar, a neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur, won the championship in both 2006 and 2007. Each club that joins the MALB must pay participation fees RM600 to RM800 ($180–$240) per team for each season.\nFor the 2008 season, the MALB restructured the playoffs to include the MALB Asean Series. Under the revised format, the top two teams from the MALB face four other international teams in a tournament culminating in the MALB Asean Series Grand Final. The MALB Asean Series represented a commitment by the MALB organization to develop and promote baseball throughout South East Asia. The MALB has sought to strengthen ties with baseball associations from Asean countries: in 2008, the MALB established a working relationship with the Singapore Baseball &amp; Softball Association, through its Secretary General, Abdu Aziz Talib, and the Garuda Baseball Club of Jakarta, Indonesia. In order to reinforce the MALB’s new regional direction after the creation of the Asean Series, league management in 2008 decided to change the league’s name from Malaysian All-Star League Baseball to Major Asean League Baseball.\nThe inaugural MALB Asean Series 2008 was a 4-day, six-team event involving two teams each from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The teams involved were the Patriots and the Selayang Stars from Malaysia, the Singapore Youth and the Typhoon Baseball Clubs from Singapore, and the Garuda and Eagles Baseball Clubs from Indonesia.\nBaseball federations and associations in Malaysia.\nThe national body for baseball in Malaysia is the Baseball Federation of Malaysia, registered with the Olympic Council of Malaysia and the National Sports Council of Malaysia. Under it, comes the state associations, of which, includes the Selangor Baseball Association, Kuala Lumpur Baseball Association, Kedah Baseball Association, Perlis Baseball Association and the Putrajaya Baseball Association."

        "text": "Actua Golf 2 (Fox Sports Golf '99 in North America) is a sports video game developed and published by Gremlin Interactive for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. Development of the game was underway as of August 1997, and it was released in September 1997 in Europe, and in June 1998 in North America. A Sega Saturn version was planned, but eventually cancelled.\nGameplay.\nThe Windows version of the game has eight golf courses, and the PlayStation version has six courses. Both versions include three real courses: The Oxfordshire, Carnoustie Links, and Kiawah Island Ocean Course. Both versions of the game use a traditional click-based method to perform golf moves. The Windows version also includes a method in which the movement of the computer mouse is used to simulate the golf club. The Windows version has several multiplayer options, including modem and LAN.\nGame modes include match play, skins, stroke play, four-ball, and foursome. The player can customize the golfer's appearance with selectable clothing, and can also choose a name for the golfer. The game features Peter Alliss and John Walls as golf commentators.\nReception.\nThe PC version received above-average reviews, while the PlayStation version received unfavourable reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Many critics felt that the game was inferior to golf game series such as \"Links\", \"Jack Nicklaus\", and \"PGA Tour\". Gordon Goble of \"CNET Gamecenter\" reviewed the Windows version and wrote that the game, \"for all its charms and potential, feels unfinished. And this sense of incompleteness does not confine itself to the periphery--it will often impact the quality of your play.\"\nJason Zimring of \"GameRevolution\" considered the PlayStation version to be a poor game, writing, \"The graphics are weak, the gameplay moves slowly, and the putting is sure to give you high blood pressure.\" Scott Alan Marriott of \"AllGame\" gave the same console version two-and-a-half stars out of five, writing, \"In the end, it's just too hard to ignore the game's flaws despite some of the more promising features.\" Michael E. Ryan of \"PC Magazine\" called the game \"a bit rough around the edges\" and stated that it \"lacks the realism provided by most of the competition, but it's a real bargain and can be lots of fun.\"\nSome critics considered the Windows version superior to the PlayStation version. The graphics of the Windows version were well received. Calvin Hubble of \"GameRevolution\" praised the Windows version for its \"damn fine\" water-reflection effect, and Craig Harris of \"IGN\" praised the moving water. Tasos Kaiafas of \"Computer Gaming World\" praised graphical effects such as swaying trees and the reflective, moving water, but stated that the graphics overall were lacking in comparison to rival golf games. Ryan considered the background graphics \"rather plain\" but stated that the overall look of the game \"is surprisingly smooth and convincing.\"\nThe putting was criticized for its difficulty. Stephen Poole of \"GameSpot\" wrote that the putting interface was \"one of the most frustrating ever seen,\" writing, \"There's very little difference in the distance on the swing meter for, say, a 50-footer and a 10-footer; in other words, the difficulty of a putt increases as the distance to the hole decreases - the exact opposite of real golf.\" Kaiafas wrote, \"The problem is the swing meter doesn't adjust for the shorter length, so you have to do some fast clicking to get it right.\" Goble felt that putting was too easy when using the mouse swing method. He also criticized the design of the swing meter, describing it as a \"horridly rough-looking gauge\". James Mielke of \"GameSpot\" also criticized the swing meter design in his review of the PlayStation version. Ryan criticized the putting interface, which he considered poor.\nThe commentary received some criticism, as reviewers considered it repetitive, although Goble did not view it as such. Poole complained of an error that prevented online multiplayer matches, but he stated that the game \"gives you the highest degree of control over your shot type that I've seen in a golf sim.\" Hubble also praised the variety of golf swings.\nThe game sold 120,000 units."

The championship, which involved thirty teams, started in August, 1953 and culminated in a finals play-off series in April, 1954 which resulted in a championship final between Warrington and Halifax. The season was also punctuated by the 1954 Rugby League World Cup, the first ever, and is also notable for its Challenge Cup final, which was drawn and had to be re-played, attracting a world record crowd for a rugby football match of either code.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1953–54 season saw Brian Bevan become the highest try scorer in rugby league history when he passed the 446 tries mark set by Alf Ellaby.\nWarrington won the Lancashire League, and Halifax won the Yorkshire League. St. Helens beat Wigan 16–8 to win the Lancashire County Cup, and Bradford Northern beat Hull F.C. 7–2 to win the Yorkshire County Cup.\nOne oddity of the season was that Double winners Warrington, who only lost 5 league games, were beaten by both the bottom Lancashire club, Liverpool City and the bottom Yorkshire club, Hull Kingston Rovers.\nChampionship.\nPlay-offs.\nFinal.\nThe Championship Final was played between Warrington and Halifax on 8 May (three days after the epic Challenge Cup re-play) at Maine Road before a crowd of 36,519. The match was televised by the BBC and it was a tremendous defensive effort that helped Warrington to a narrow 8–7 win, with Bath kicking 4 goals.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe 1954 Challenge Cup was the 53rd staging of rugby league's oldest knockout competition, the Challenge Cup. It featured clubs from the 1953–54 Northern Rugby Football League season and is notable for its Final which had to be replayed before possibly the largest crowd in rugby league history."

It may be performed in some form on all apparatuses, but is most commonly performed on the women's uneven bars and on the men's rings, parallel bars, and horizontal bar.\nThe kip is an important technique that is used as both a mount and an element or connecting technique in a bar routine. The kip allows the gymnast to swing below the bar to arrive in a front support on the bar. From the front support, the gymnast may then perform any number of skills. The glide kip is the most commonly used mount on the women's uneven bars.\nThe kip has been used since the early days of modern gymnastics. Currently, in the USA, the kip first appears in the women's USAG Level 4.\nVariations.\nVariations of the kip include the long hang kip, glide kip, drop kip, kip with stoop through and kip with jump turn."

The top two teams in each pool advanced to the Round of 16. The six third-place teams were ranked against each other, with ties being broken by the ratio of points won to lost. The best two advanced to the Round of 16, while the other four played two matches (#3 vs. #6 and #4 vs. #5) with the winners of those two matches advancing as well. The losers of those matches, along with the fourth-place teams in each group, were eliminated.\nThe 16 teams that advanced to the elimination rounds played a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match between the semifinal losers.\nQualification.\nThe top eight finishes that a team has from January 1, 2007, to July 20, 2008, on the Swatch FIVB World Tour (2007 and 2008), SWATCH FIVB World Championships (2007) and on FIVB recognised Continental Championship Finals, counts towards Olympic qualification for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.\nThere are 24 teams competing at the Olympic Games, with a maximum of two teams per country.\nThe United States had four teams in the top 8 of the FIVB Beach Volleyball Olympic Ranking, Brazil had seven teams in the top 24, but only two teams from each country can participate in the Olympic Games.

In addition, this championship is conducted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (R&amp;A). The championship was not held in 1871 due to a disagreement over a new trophy, from 1915 to 1919 and from 1940 to 1945 due to the First and Second World Wars respectively, and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe reigning champion of the competition is automatically invited to play in the other three majors (Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship) for the next five years. The prize of the tournament is the Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, and the champion personally keeps the trophy until the next competition the following year. The champion also receives a gold medal, which they are allowed to keep permanently. Until 1870 the champion received the Challenge Belt, however when Tom Morris Jr. (more commonly known as Young Tom Morris) won the Open Championship three times in a row he won the belt outright, necessitating the need for a new trophy.\nHarry Vardon holds the record for the most Open Championship victories, winning six times during his career. The oldest winner of the Open Championship is Tom Morris Sr. (or Old Tom Morris) who was old when he won in 1867. His son, Tom Morris Jr., is the youngest winner of the championship, he was old when he won the 1868 Open Championship. He also won the most consecutive times with four victories (1868–1872). Henrik Stenson and Cameron Smith hold the distinction of being both the most strokes under par for 72 holes (−20), which they achieved in 2016 and 2022 respectively. Stenson also recorded the lowest total score (264) when he won in 2016. Brian Harman is the current champion, winning the 2023 Open."

It was originally designed to engage young people vulnerable to exclusion from education to gain qualifications through engagement with a sport in which they demonstrated talent and potential.\nHistory.\nThe programme was launched in September 2001 following the opening of the College's SPACe Sports Centre in Shoreditch in February that year. Construction of SPACe was funded by Sport England as a Centre of Excellence in basketball and cricket. Following the success of the Football Academy set up by Malcolm Williams in 1996, the College's Sport, Leisure and Tourism team designed the basketball programme. A Cricket Academy Programme was launched along similar lines by the same HCC team in 2002.\nAn athletics academy was established in 2007. The basketball academy has grown and experienced unprecedented success on court and in developing players aged between 16 and 20 (men and women) from all over London, as well as enhancing their life chances through qualifications gained whilst studying at Hackney College.\nOperating in an area recognised historically as a hot-bed of basketball development and talent thanks to the work carried out by Joe White at Homerton House School and Hackney White Heat along with the success of East London Royals Basketball Club and Haringey Angels Women, HCCA coaches Tony Garbelotto (co-founder with Joe White of the London Towers Junior Programme in the 1990s), Solomon Ayinla, Andrea Norton and Sam Stiller have helped develop over 250 players since 2001. Players such as Darius Defoe, Perry Lawson, Serhat Urkut Jeff Danchie and Jean Wakanena have graduated to play professionally for Newcastle Eagles and Plymouth Raiders in the British Basketball League. Eddie Morrison (MK Lions) and Darrell Bethune (Everton Tigers) also went on to play in the BBL in the 2008/09 season. Samuel Toluwase entered the BBL with Essex Pirates (2009/10 season). In 2011/12, Courtney Van Beest joined Worcester Wolves and Albert Margai Guildford Heat. Many others have represented England and Great Britain at junior level and have moved on to US high school/college programmes and British universities.\nProgramme overview.\nAcademy players train for 2 hours every week-day and play matches on Wednesday afternoons and Friday evenings in a variety of competitions. From an initial fixture list of 25 matches in 2001/02, all Academy teams now play a combined total close to 100 matches per season. In 2008/09, Academy teams played 77 competitive matches in 13 different competitions, winning 6 titles and finishing runners-up in 2. Academy Teams had a 66/11 winning record in 08/09. The programme is fully inclusive. Students who want to learn/improve their basketball skills train alongside the \"elite\" players. These players form the HCCA B Team and have won the South East Student Sports Association (SESSA) Cups and Premier League for 4 of the last 7 years. In July 2009, HCCA became the only inner-London academy (and one of only 12 nationally, expanding to 20 in 2010) accredited by England Basketball to deliver the AASE programme to talented players from September 2009 onwards.\nAchievements.\nOn-court success has been constant over the last ten seasons and unrivalled by any other College Academy Programme in the UK (of which there are now many). HCCA U19 Men went unbeaten in any National competition from 2002 to 2008 and won the British Colleges Sport (BCS) National Championship from 2004 to 2008 (5 years in succession), finishing 3rd in 2009, regaining the title in 2010 and winning both BCS and English Schools (ESBBA) National Academies Cups for the last six years. HCCA Under 19 Women have also won all their equivalent BCS and ESBBA Cups and Championships over the last six years. The HCCA Women also won the World Corporate Games title in Leeds (August 2008). The Senior Men (all under 20) have won the London Metropolitan Basketball League Premier Division Championship for seven out of the last nine years regaining the title in 08/09, retaining it in 2009/10 and defending the title in 2010/11 and 2011/12. HCCA won the LMBL Men's Cup for the first time in 07/08 and became the first team in the history of the LMBL to complete the Premier Division/Cup double in 2011/12. Four HCCA players were selected to represent Great Britain U 20 Men in the European Youth Championships in Romania (August 2008). Not only was this more than from any other single Academy programme, these players were also the only ones to be selected from a British development programme. These players were Darrell Bethune, Ali Fullah, Michael Ochareobia and Orlan Jackman (HCCA 2005/06)\nThe aggregate total of matches played by HCCA teams between September 2001 and June 2009 is 567 of which 504 were won, a win percentage of 88.9%. A combined total of 92 competitions and tournaments have been entered by HCCA teams over the last 8 full seasons. 66 of these have been won and HCCA have been runner's up in a further 13, an overall success rate of 72%.\nHCCA Coach Tony Garbelotto is now Head Coach of Everton Tigers (now Mersey Tigers) and former Lead Assistant Head Coach of the Great Britain national basketball team(men) and led Tigers to the BBL Cup victory beating Plymouth Raiders, BBL Championship and BBL Play-Off runner's up in his first season (2008/09)and winning the BBL Play-Off title in May 2010. He left HCCA to take up the Everton Tigers (now Mersey Tigers) post in April 2008. HCCA Coach Solomon Ayinla is a former pro player (Europe and the UK), Assistant Coach with the Nigerian National team and Head Coach of the London Metropolitan University Basketball Programme (runners-up in the BUCS Championship in 2006 and 2007). Ayinla guided London Met Men from England Basketball Div 4 to Div 1 (2009/10) in consecutive seasons. London Mets won the England Basketball Senior Men's National Trophy in March 2010. This was achieved with teams made up predominately of present players and graduates of the HCCA programme. Well publicised financial difficulties experienced by London Met University in 2010 saw the National League programme disbanded later the same year. Chris Morris was Programme Administrator for HCCA since it was established in 2001 until December 2010. Since December 2017 he has been Manager and Head of Delegation for the Great Britain Men's Basketball Team.\nThe name \"SPACe\", home of the HCC Basketball Academy, derives from Sport and Performing Arts Centre. See Hackney Space Centre. Joe White died in December 2002 (aged 39). Malcolm Williams died in May 2006 (aged 68). In October 2006 SPACe sports hall was named in honour of Malcolm Williams, recognition of the work he carried out at Hackney Community College. A plaque commemorating the dedication was unveiled by Lord Sebastian Coe who had been a close friend of Malcolm for many years."

        "text": "The men's Olympic beach volleyball tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing took place at the Beach Volleyball Ground at Chaoyang Park from August 9 to August 22.\nEach of the 24 pairs in the tournament was placed in one of six groups of four teams apiece, and played a round-robin within that pool. The top two teams in each pool advanced to the Round of 16. The six third-place teams were ranked against each other, with ties being broken by the ratio of points won to lost. The best two advanced to the Round of 16, while the other four played two matches (#3 vs. #6 and #4 vs. #5) with the winners of those two matches advancing as well. The losers of those matches, along with the fourth-place teams in each group, were eliminated.\nThe 16 teams that advanced to the elimination rounds played a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match between the semifinal losers.\nQualification.\nThe top eight finishes that a team had from January 1, 2007, to July 20, 2008, on the Swatch FIVB World Tour (2007 and 2008), SWATCH FIVB World Championships (2007) and on FIVB recognised Continental Championship Finals, counted towards Olympic qualification for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.\nThere were 24 teams competing at the Olympic Games, with a maximum of two teams per country.\nBrazil had four teams in the top 10 of the FIVB Beach Volleyball Olympic Ranking, but only two teams from each country could participate in the Olympic Games. Also Germany, the USA, and the Netherlands had three teams each in the top 24.\nQualifiers.\nThe official cut off date for Olympic qualification for beach volleyball was July 20, 2008. The final Olympic Qualification Ranking for the 24 teams, was announced confirmed by the FIVB on July 24, 2008.\nIf the host nation had a team in the top 6 teams on the FIVB Olympic ranking when the Olympic Games began, it was automatically seeded as #1; therefore China's team Xu - Wu (ranked as #5 on the Olympic ranking,) was seeded as #1. Accordingly, the #1 ranked Rogers - Dalhausser, was seeded as #2, Ricardo - Emanuel as #3, M. Araújo - Fabio Luiz as #4 and Nummerdor - Schuil as #5.\nThe Brazilian team Harley - Pedro, was placed as #5 on the Olympic ranking, but did not qualify because of the two teams per country rule. Harley - Pedro was ranked as #2 on the World ranking per July 21, 2008, and #1 per August 4, 2008.\nPreliminary round.\nThe two best teams from each group advanced to the quarterfinal round.\nThe composition of the preliminary rounds was announced confirmed on April 16, 2008.\nThe #1 seeded team was placed in pool A, #2 in pool B, #3 in C, #4 in D, #5 in E, and #6 in F. But if the host nation had a team in the top 6 teams, it was automatically seeded as #1. Therefore, China's team Xu-Wu (ranked as #5,) is placed in pool A.\nThere was held a draw of lots between seed #7 - #9, between #10 - #12, between #13 - #18, and between #19 - #24. The Drawing of lots was hosted by the 1 to 1 Energy Grand Slam, in Gstaad on July 26, as part of the 2008 SWATCH FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour.\nA team received 2 points for each match won, and 1 point for each match lost.\nAfter the preliminary rounds, from August 9–14, 2008, the teams placed 1st and 2nd in each pool had qualified for the playoffs. The two best 3rd placed teams had also qualified. Two Lucky Loser matches qualified two more of the 3rd placed teams. The two 3rd placed teams that lost their Lucky Losers match, were out of the competition. Also out of the competition were teams placed 4th in their pool.\nAll times are China Standard Time (UTC+8)\nLucky loser.\nOf the 6 teams that are placed third in their pools, two are directly qualified to the playoffs. Of the four remaining third placed teams, another two teams get to the playoffs through winning a Lucky Loser match.\n3rd placed teams\nThis table shows the results of the third placed teams after the pool play, and before the Lucky Loser matches.\nLucky Loser\nResults of the Lucky Loser matches only.\nFinal ranking.\nIf the host nation has a team in the top 6 teams on the FIVB Olympic ranking when the Olympic Games begin, it is automatically seeded as #1. Therefore, China's team Xu - Wu (ranked as #5 on the FIVB Olympic ranking,) was seeded as #1 before the Games."

        "text": "Badminton Australia (BA) is the top governing body for badminton in Australia. It is committed to promoting the awareness and development of badminton within Australia and is responsible for the management of international badminton relations and events. Badminton Australia also organises and runs junior events such as the June Bevan Teams Event or CP Maddern Trophy with their respective Australasian Championships, along with the Australian Closed Championships.\nHistory.\nBadminton has been played in Australia since the early 1900s, especially within Victoria. The Australian Badminton Association was formed in 1932, and shortly after Australia became the 11th member of the International Badminton Federation. In 1936, alongside New Zealand, it formed the Oceania Badminton Confederation (now known as Badminton Oceania).\nThe current national office for BA is located in Melbourne, Victoria.\nAchievements.\nAustralia is not yet a competitive nation in the field of badminton due to the current Asian and European/Scandinavian dominance. \nWhen commenting on Australian players at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, BA's Chief Executive Paul Brettell has said that \"A bad draw will see [the Australian players] out after their first game\" and that \"Australia's greatest achievement is just qualifying for the event\". These statements reflect the historical performance of badminton within Australia. For instance, badminton was one of just two Australian sports (the other being Rugby Sevens) not to win a medal at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, and at the 2008 Olympics all Australians were knocked out of their respective first matches.\nA notable exception to this trend was Anna Lao at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where she reached the quarterfinals in the women's singles, doubles and mixed and was overall ranked 5th in the world for each of those events. Another noticeable achievement is from Sze Yu, who was runner-up at the 1985 World Badminton Grand Prix, silver medallist in men's singles at the 1986 Commonwealth Games and also the winner of the 1988 U.S. Open Badminton Championships.\nMore recently, there appears to be a resurgence in Australian badminton with a strong performance at the 2012 London Olympics where Leanne Choo and Renuga Veeran reached the quarterfinals of the women's doubles event."

Hosted by Australia for the first time, as part of the Bicentenary celebrations, it was the fourth edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup, and came six years after the preceding 1982 World Cup in New Zealand.\nThe tournament was organised by the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC), with matches played over 60 overs. Australia won the tournament for a third consecutive time, defeating England in the final by eight wickets. New Zealand defeated Ireland in the third-place playoff, while the Netherlands, the only other team at the tournament, placed fifth and last after failing to win a single match. Both Ireland and the Netherlands were making their tournament debuts. India had been invited to compete, as they had at the previous two tournaments, but were forced to withdraw after failing to secure enough money from sponsors. Two Australians, Lindsay Reeler and Lyn Fullston, led the tournament in runs and wickets, respectively. The player of the series was English all-rounder Carole Hodges, who placed third for runs scored and second for wickets taken. She received a Waterford Crystal trophy valued at A$4,000, donated by an Irish firm, R&amp;A Bailey.\nWarm-up matches.\nAt least five warm-up matches were played against Australian state and invitational teams, which were interspersed throughout the tournament.\nFinals.\nFinal.\nThe final, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, was broadcast live on radio and on ABC Television. It was attended by around 3,000 people, although the ground had a capacity at the time of over 90,000. Janette Brittin, who played for England in the match, later described the venue as having \"wall-to-wall seating with no one sitting in them\", making it \"a very large and a very lonely place\".

        "text": "Mark Kerry Graham (born 29 September 1955) is a New Zealand former professional rugby league footballer and coach. A back-rower and former captain of the New Zealand national rugby league team, he has been named as the greatest player the country has produced in the century from 1907 to 2006.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Auckland, An Otahahu junior, Graham played in 29 tests, captaining the Kiwis side in 18 of them and scoring 7 tries from 1977 to 1988. In 1980 when playing in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for the Norths club, he helped his side to victory in the grand final. That year in the BRL Preliminary Final against Valleys at Lang Park, Brisbane, Graham put a hit on Wally Lewis that crushed his oesophagus. At the end of the season he captained the 1980 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France.\nIn a trans-Tasman test at Lang Park on 18 June 1985, while serving as Kiwi captain Graham was deliberately taken out of the game by a high shot from Noel \"Crusher\" Cleal while playing brilliantly and inspirationally. After winning premierships with his club in New Zealand he played two seasons in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership with the Norths club under coach Graham Lowe, winning the BRL premiership in his second year there, as well as the New South Wales Rugby League premiership for the North Sydney Bears between 1981 and 1988. He also captained the Bears.\nIn what was the last match of the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour, Graham played at second-row forward for the Kiwis in their victory, which saw them qualify for the final of the final of the 1985–1988 World Cup against Australia. In that match Graham also played at second-row forward, but New Zealand were unable to defeat the Kangaroos.\nAt the end of the 1988 Winfield Cup season, Graham travelled to England to captain the newly promoted Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 1002) club in the 1988–89 Rugby Football League season. In 1989 his biography \"Mark my words: The Mark Graham Story\" was published.\nIn 2019, Graham spoke of how he ended up at North Sydney saying \"I was due to meet with [Norths secretary] Ken McCaffery one Sunday afternoon in Brisbane. That morning, I went to church and he was there … so that was a good start.\nThen he called me when I was touring England with the Kiwis in 1980 and offered me $15,000. I said if you double it, I’ll agree this minute. He did … and I realised then I could have made a lot more!, But the joke was on him - what he didn’t realise is that I would have played for nothing. My first contract at Brisbane Norths, I signed the back of a coaster in the pub and they gave me $500 ... Money never meant much to me\".\nPost playing.\nIn 1995 Graham was one of the initial inductees of the NZRL Legends of League. The following year he was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. He went on to coach the Auckland Warriors in the National Rugby League for two seasons in 1999 and 2000. He later became defensive coach for the Japanese rugby union club, Kintetsu.\nIn August 2006 Graham was named at in the North Sydney Bears' \"Team of the Century\". In 2007, he was named at second row in the New Zealand Kiwis \"Team of the Century\" and also further honoured as New Zealand's rugby league \"Player of the Century\". He is an Auckland Rugby League Immortal. In 2008, Graham was also named at second-row in a Norths Devils all-time greatest team. In July 2018, it was announced that Graham would be inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nMark Graham now lives in Gladstone where he is an Australian Workers' Union delegate at the Gladstone Ports Corporation."

One skateboarding dog named Tyson appeared in this show and has since been featured on many websites as the pioneer of skateboarding dogs. Another bulldog, Tillman, has appeared in \"Greatest American Dog\". Tillman holds the Guinness World Record for \"Fastest 100 m on a skateboard by a dog.\"\nDogs can be trained to ride skateboards by familiarising them with a skateboard in stages and rewarding the dog as it becomes more comfortable and accomplished. A children's book was published on this subject in 2006: \"Little Yellow Dog Says Look At Me\". In this fictional story, the dog skateboards for attention."

        "text": "Rugby union in Ivory Coast is essentially amateur, with some degree of semi-professionalization in its top-flight league and the national rugby union team.\nThe sport is popular among school children, but the rugby union playing population in Ivory Coast is still relatively small with only 14 clubs. There are around 5,383 registered players, and the game takes in people from all walks of life. As of 22 June 2014, the men's national side are ranked 47th in the world.\nGoverning body.\nRugby union in the Ivory Coast is administered by the Fédération Ivoirienne de Rugby. It was founded in 1961 and became affiliated to the International Rugby Board in 1988.\nHistory.\nThe sport is mainly played in and around the former capital Abidjan.\nThe first recorded game in the Ivory Coast was just after the Second World War, in 1946, when Mme Andre Benois organised a match between two teams of expatriates. They used an improvised ball made from the inner tube of a tyre.\nThe game was further developed by French schoolmasters working in the country.\nAs a former French colony, the country has tended to come under the French sphere of influence, and many top players, including Max Brito played in France. Although the origins of Ivorian rugby go back to the 1960s and earlier, real growth came about when the paid French official Jean-François Turon managed to get the game adopted by Abidjan University at the turn of the 1980s, but it is François Dali who is seen as the father of Ivorian rugby, and his son, Athanase Dali, was the national captain during the 1990s.\nIvorian delegates were amongst those who went to the centenary congress of the International Rugby Football Board in 1986.\nIvory Coast is a founding member of the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR), which was launched officially in January 1986, in Tunis, Tunisia. Rugby officials from Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal, Tanzania, Kenya, the Seychelles and Madagascar also attended.\nNational team.\nThe Ivory Coast national rugby union team, nicknamed ‘The Elephants’ (), is a third-tier rugby union side representing the Ivory Coast. The national team is a relatively recent creation. It was not even in existence when the first (invitation only) Rugby World Cup was played in 1987. They played their first international in 1990 against Zimbabwe. Their presence at the 1995 Rugby World Cup wasn't particularly memorable, with an 89–0 loss to Scotland in the opening match, a worthy performance to France in their 54–18 loss, in a game where the Ivorians managed to score two tries, and a 29–11 final defeat by Tonga. The Ivory Coast came close to qualifying for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, but were eliminated by Namibia.\n1995 World Cup.\nThe Ivory Coast's first—and thus far only—appearance at the Rugby World Cup was in 1995. Namibia, a former South African territory, had narrowly missed out on qualifying for the World Cup because they had rested a number of key players in the qualifying rounds. Ivory Coast slipped past them, as well as past Zimbabwe and the third African favourite Morocco.\nIvory Coast went into the World Cup optimistic, with coach Claude Ezoua quoted as saying: \"We want to prove to the world that there is more to African rugby than just South Africa.\" Although Namibia and Zimbabwe had qualified for the RWC at different times, both of these countries were firmly within the South African orbit, and had mostly white players who spoke English and/or Afrikaans. The Ivory Coast, on the other hand, was in West Africa and was French- rather than English-speaking. Moreover, as none of its players was white, their success has been seen by many as a positive sign that black Africa was emerging as a force in world rugby.\nThe composition of the World Cup squad also revealed interesting things about Ivorian rugby. 25 out of 26 were Ivorian-born (the exception being Max Brito, who was born in Senegal); half the squad was based and played in France; and many of the players were originally from Abidjan's harbour district. At this point, eight of the country's ten senior clubs were based in the capital. As an incentive, many of them had been paid the equivalent of £1.25 to turn up to training.\nOnce in the World Cup, the Ivory Coast's fortunes waned. Captain Athanase Dali was injured playing against Scotland who won 89–0, and fearless tackler Max Brito suffered a spinal injury when he went for a Tongan.\nSince 1995.\nIvory Coast compete for the Africa Cup, but have never ranked high in the competition for it. As the result of its 2013 Africa Cup performance, in which \"Les Éléphants\" defeated Zambia, Mauritius and Morocco, Ivory Coast were promoted from Division 1C to Division 1B of the competition."

The East Germans played against mostly Eastern Bloc countries, but they did play Netherlands (once), Sweden (three times), Denmark (twice) and Luxembourg (once). Their one-game against Luxembourg also happened to be their last, taking place shortly before the reunification of Germany in 1990. Despite requests from its West German counterpart, the East German rugby body, \"DTSB\", refused to permit an international against West Germany to take place and the two teams never played each other over their 40-year history.\nThe team did not compete in the FIRA championship but did take part in a number of four-nation tournaments: 1961 in Brno, 1964 in Malmö, 1978, 1979 and 1983 in Bulgaria (Varna and Nesebar).\nGDR Coaches.\nThe coaches of the GDR national team were the following:"

        "text": "Actua Golf (VR Golf '97 in North America) is a sports video game developed and published by Gremlin Interactive for PlayStation and Sega Saturn.\nGameplay.\n\"Actua Golf\" features two fictional golf courses. The game includes various modes, such as four-ball, match, skins, and stroke. Options such as mulligans and gimmes are also available. The player can select the golfer's outfit and skin color. Selectable weather conditions include dry, damp, and wet. Various camera angles are also featured. The game has several golf commentators, including Peter Alliss and Pat O'Brien.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Actua Golf\" was developed and published by Gremlin Interactive. In Europe, it was released for the PlayStation on October 18, 1996, followed by a Sega Saturn release sometime in that same month. In North America, the game was released for the same consoles under the title \"VR Golf '97\". The U.S. version was published by VR Sports, a division of Interplay. A Nintendo 64 version of \"VR Golf '97\" was scheduled for release in late 1997, but it was cancelled.\nThe game was released on Microsoft Windows on Steam by Pixel Games UK in December 2022. This version of the game is an emulated port of the PlayStation version.\nReception.\n\"GamePro\" reviewer \"Air Hendrix\" considered the PlayStation version a close competitor to \"PGA Tour 97\". Reviewing the Sega Saturn version, Air Hendrix wrote that the game \"has what \"PGA '97\" doesn't have: fast, clean action and spectacular course graphics.\" The latter review concluded that while the game \"has plenty of room to improve, it ranks at the top of this year's Saturn leaderboards.\" IGN stated that golf games \"have never been a success for console systems\" but that \"VR Golf '97\" \"beats the odds and successfully combines PC features and console gameplay.\" Two reviewers for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (\"EGM\") called the game addictive. A couple of reviewers for \"GameFan\" considered it among the best games available at that time, and two reviewers for \"Mean Machines Sega\" considered it the best golf game for the Saturn. Jeff Kitts of GameSpot, reviewing the PlayStation version, wrote that \"there's nothing remotely 'VR,' as in virtual reality, about VR Golf '97.\" Kitts wrote, however, that the game \"delivers just about everything, in terms of gameplay, one could ask for in a video game simulation.\"\nThe graphics received some praise. However, Kitts stated that the game did not take advantage of the PlayStation's capabilities and that it \"fails miserably in the graphics department.\" Kitts stated that the environments were generic and \"frightfully dull,\" and that the golfer \"is downright droopy\" and \"a jagged-edged graphic disaster.\" Air Hendrix stated that the Saturn version was \"a bit choppier\" than its PlayStation counterpart, and wrote that the \"smoothly moving players look far too elongated, which detracts from the realism.\" \"Edge\" considered the players to be \"gangly\".\nThe game's abundance of options was praised. The variety of camera angles received some praise as well. Air Hendrix considered the putting too easy, while \"Edge\" complained of inaccuracies regarding the putting system.\n\"EGM\"s reviewers praised the commentary. Stephen Fulljames of \"Computer and Video Games\" wrote that Alliss \"provides an accurate, and somewhat acerbic commentary throughout.\" \"Edge\" praised the inclusion of Alliss as commentator but stated that his remarks become repetitive. Kitts considered the commentary \"boring and repetitive.\" Air Hendrix wrote that O'Brien \"calls the play-by-play with accurate and often amusing commentary, though he does repeat himself a bit.\" In 1998, Saturn Power ranked the game 93rd in its Top 100 Sega Saturn Games."

        "text": "The Texas A&amp;M Aggie baseball team represents Texas A&amp;M University in NCAA Division I college baseball. The Aggies have competed in the Southeastern Conference since 2013. The Aggies play home games at Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park. The team is led by head coach Jim Schlossnagle.\nHistory.\nTexas A&amp;M baseball has compiled an all-time record of 2550-1427-42 (.634 winning percentage) through the 2014 season. The Aggies have won 20 conference championships (15 in the Southwest Conference, four in the Big 12, and one in the SEC). Texas A&amp;M has made 33 NCAA tournament appearances, advancing to the College World Series seven times, in 1951, 1964, 1993, 1999, 2011, 2017, and 2022. The Aggies have never won a national championship in baseball. Texas A&amp;M's long, rich history and tradition in baseball began in 1894. After a decade break, the program returned in 1904 and has competed every year since. With over 2,700 all-time victories, the Aggies have more wins than any other SEC program.\nThe early years (1879–1958).\nBaseball is among the first organized sports played at Texas A&amp;M, and what was then A&amp;M College of Texas fielded its first club in 1879. The first games were played between members of Company A and Company B of the Corps of Cadets. It's not surprising baseball started so early, considering that Texas A&amp;M and Major League Baseball were both founded in 1876, and it was one of America's most popular sports of the period. The team played many of its earliest games against Galveston, Bryan, Baylor, Navasota, and Calvert. Games were limited by what town could be reached by train or horse. Most of the teams didn't have uniforms or even a real field. The same train tracks that run by Olsen Field today used to carry the team to its games. By 1907, the Cincinnati Reds had stopped off in College Station and beat A&amp;M 9-0, scoring all 9 runs in the third inning, when, \"our boys went to pieces.\" Seventeen head coaches led A&amp;M baseball from 1904 to 1958, including football coaches Charley Moran, Dana X. Bible, and Homer Norton. During this period, A&amp;M finished with a 626–469–27 record (.572 winning percentage), claimed seven Southwest Conference titles, and made their first trip to the College World Series in 1951. In 1951, led by Beau Bell, the Aggies won a three-game series in the District VI playoffs over Arizona and advanced to the College World Series. In the 1951 College World Series, Texas A&amp;M defeated Ohio State 3–2 in a first-round elimination game to give the Aggies their first College World Series win.\nTom Chandler era (1959–1984).\nTom Chandler came to Texas A&amp;M as an assistant to head coach Beau Bell in 1958. He took over as head coach in 1959 and immediately won the Southwest Conference championship in his first year. Over the next 25 years at the helm, Chandler led the Aggies to four more conference championships, eight NCAA postseasons, and an appearance in the 1964 College World Series. His teams finished 660–329–10 (.667 winning percentage). Chandler was honored for his accomplishments by being inducted into the American Association of Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame. His jersey is now displayed on the left-field wall at Olsen Field in recognition of his contributions. Tom Chandler was born on March 19, 1925, in Greenville, Texas. He attended Dallas public schools and graduated from Adamson High School in 1943. He then attended Arkansas A&amp;M for two years in the Marine V-12 program. In 1946, he graduated from the Marine Corps Officers School. He served as a member of the Marine Corps Honor Guard that presented the colors at the funeral of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in April 1945.\nMark Johnson era (1985–2005).\nMark Johnson, an assistant under Chandler, assumed head-coaching duties in 1985 and guided the program for just over two decades. During that time, his teams put together a win–loss record of 876–431–3 (.670 winning percentage) and made College World Series appearances in 1993 and 1999. Johnson's highly ranked teams and powerful offenses in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s brought excitement and increased attendance to Olsen Field. His #7 jersey hangs on the right-field wall at Olsen Field in honor of his service to A&amp;M. Johnson's 876 wins are the most in Texas A&amp;M history. Johnson led the Aggies to a 37–29 (.561) postseason record in 13 appearances.\nIn 1989, the Aggies put together a 58–7 record (17–4 in SWC play) and were SWC co-champions. The Aggies won the SWC tournament and hosted a regional at Olsen Field, which included Jackson State, BYU, South Alabama, and number-12 LSU. The Aggies exploded in the first three games, outscoring their opponents 65–13 before they were upset by LSU twice, ending one of the most remarkable seasons in A&amp;M history. Despite not advancing to the College World Series, the Aggies finished the year number two overall in the final Baseball America poll (behind Wichita State, winner of the CWS). The Aggies defeated number-three Texas four out of five times (with two wins coming on walk-off home runs), including twice in the SWC tournament.\nJohnson led the Aggies to the College World Series in 1993. The Aggies won the Southwest Conference championship and swept through the Central I Regional in College Station (defeating Yale, Lamar, UCLA, and North Carolina) at Olsen Field to advance to Omaha for the third time. A&amp;M defeated Kansas, 5–1, for the second CWS win in A&amp;M history. Notable stars on the team included Jeff Granger (who holds the single-game strikeout record at A&amp;M with 21), Brian Thomas, Chris Clemons, Trey Moore, and Kelly Wunsch.\nThe Aggies again advanced to the College World Series in 1999, led by Daylan Holt, Steven Truitt, John Scheschuk, Dell Lindsey, and Casey Fossum. In the College Station regional, the Aggies lost to Long Beach State in game 2 before defeating Ole Miss and Long Beach State twice to advance to the super regionals, where they faced number-17 Clemson. The Aggies defeated Clemson in a best of three series, 2–1, earning the team's fourth trip to the College World Series.\nRob Childress era (2006–2021).\nIn 2006, Texas A&amp;M hired Nebraska associate head coach and pitching coach Rob Childress to take over the program. After struggling to a losing record his first year, Childress guided the Aggies to a 597–306–2 (.660) record, two Big 12 championships (2010 and 2011), one Southeastern Conference championship (2016), and College World Series appearances in 2011 and 2017. Childress led the Aggies to the postseason 13 years in a row (2007–2019, the longest streak in Aggie history).\nThe Aggies advanced to the 2011 College World Series, led by Michael Wacha, Ross Stripling, John Stilson, Tyler Naquin, Jacob House, and Matt Juengel. A&amp;M faced Missouri in the final game of the 2011 Big 12 Conference baseball tournament. Missouri took an early 6–0 lead. The Aggies fought their way back, and while down 9–8 in the bottom of the 9th, Gregg Alcazar tied the game on a 3-2, 2-out, RBI single to send the game to extra innings. The Aggies capped off the rally by winning it in the bottom of the 10th with a walk-off home run by Andrew Collazo, earning him the award of Most Outstanding Player. Jacob House, Kevin Gonzalez, Tyler Naquin, and Michael Wacha were named to the All-Tournament team. Texas A&amp;M won the College Station regional with wins over Wright State, Seton Hall, and Arizona to advance to the super regional at Tallahassee to face the fifth national seed, Florida State. A&amp;M won the first game 6–2, but was blasted in game 2, losing 23–9. The Aggies won the rubber match 11–2 to advance to the College World Series. The Aggies lost to eventual champion South Carolina in a very close game, 5–4.\nFollowing a 2021 season that saw the Aggies finish in last place in the SEC, Athletic Director Ross Bjork announced that the school would not renew Childress' contract for 2022. Childress's 622 victories ranked third in school history at the time of his dismissal.\nJim Schlossnagle era (2022 - present).\nOn June 9, 2021, Jim Schlossnagle was named the head baseball coach of the Aggies. The Schlossnagle-led Aggies had a regular-season record of 35–17 and finished first in the SEC West in his first season at the helm, earning Texas A&amp;M the number-five national seed. In the College Station regional, A&amp;M hosted Oral Roberts, Louisiana-Lafayette, and TCU. The Aggies and Horned Frogs met in the regional final with the Aggies beating Schlossnagle's former team 15–9 to advance to the super regionals and host the 12th-seeded Louisville Cardinals. Texas A&amp;M won both games against Louisville to advance to their seventh College World Series. In the College World Series, Texas A&amp;M lost their opener to Oklahoma, 13-8, but won their next two games against Texas and Notre Dame to advance to the bracket-1 final against Oklahoma.\nStadium.\nThe Aggies play at Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park, named in honor of C. E. \"Pat\" Olsen, a 1923 graduate of Texas A&amp;M University and a former baseball player in the New York Yankees farm system. The field opened in 1978 and underwent major renovation after the 2011 season. Average attendance in 2011 was just under 4000 per game. The stadium hold up to 6100 people.\nPlayers selected in the MLB draft.\nNote: the first Major League Baseball draft was held in 1965."

The team played its home games in Littlejohn Coliseum in Clemson, South Carolina. All games were produced and broadcast locally by the Clemson Tigers Sports Network.\nPre-season.\nOn Tuesday, October 21, 2008, the NCAA suspended Freshman Catalin Baciu for the first five games of the season for his participation with a Romanian professional basketball team. The term of the suspension equals the number of games Baciu played as a 15-year-old for U Mobitelco Cluj, a club team that plays in Romania's top pro division, Divizia A. Although Baciu was not paid for his participation, NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from playing on a professional team, regardless of whether they are employed. He played for a total of four minutes in his five games with U Mobitelco Cluj.\nOn Sunday, October 26, 2008, members of the ACC media were polled and picked Clemson to finish fifth in the conference behind North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest and Miami respectively.\nRegular season.\nOn Sunday, November 16, 2008, The Tigers won the inaugural Charleston Classic 8-team tournament in Charleston, SC. This marks the 25th time in school history Clemson has won a regular season tournament.\nOn Saturday, November 22, 2008, Clemson beat Charlotte 71–70 at Halton Arena, marking the first time ever a current member of the Atlantic Coast Conference has played at Charlotte. (Miami played during there during their time as a member of the Big East).\nOn Wednesday, January 21, 2009, Clemson lost to North Carolina 94–70. This extended the NCAA record for the longest road losing streak against one opponent to 54 games. This also ended Clemson's streak of not losing back-to-back ACC games that dated back to the 2006–07 season.\nOn Sunday, January 25, 2009, with a 73–59 victory over Georgia Tech, Senior guard K. C. Rivers broke the team record for most career wins as a player with 85. The previous record of 84 was co-held Cliff Hammonds and Elden Campbell.\nOn Monday, February 2, 2009, EA Sports announced that Littlejohn Coliseum was one of the Top-15 toughest places to play in College Basketball. Through an online poll, Fans determined 15 finalists, whose home courts were judged to be the most difficult for opposing teams to play in. These results will form an integral part of a new game mode in the EA SPORTS NCAA Basketball videogame franchise for 2009–10.\nOn Wednesday, February 4, 2009, Clemson defeated No. 3 Duke in Littlejohn Coliseum by a score of 74–47. With the win, Clemson snapped a 22-game regular season losing streak to the Blue Devils dating back to January 7, 1997. The win was also Clemson's first win over a top-5 team since a victory over No. 5 Virginia in 2002.\nThe 27-point victory was Clemson's largest margin of victory against a top 25 team in history. The previous best was a 22-point victory margin on two occasions. Clemson defeated a fourth-ranked NC State team led by David Thompson at Clemson 92–70 on Feb 22, 1975 at Clemson, and defeated a 13th ranked Maryland team by 22 points, 93–71 on January 19, 1977, at Clemson.\nThe defeat was also the worst suffered by Duke since the NCAA Championship game of 1990, a 103–73 victory by UNLV on April 2, 1990. The 27-point margin was the largest for Duke in an ACC regular season game since January 18, 1984, when Wake Forest defeated Duke at Winston-Salem, 97–66.\nClemson's 10-point win over Boston College in Boston on Feb 10 was just the third ACC road win over an ACC team that finished the year with a winning record in the last 22 years. Boston College finished the ACC regular season with a 9–7 record and went to the NCAA tournament.\nOn Tuesday, February 17, the EA Sports Tour visited Littlejohn Coliseum as Clemson hosted Maryland. Along with judging the game day atmosphere, the tour handed out video games, T-shirts and hosted an NCAA Basketball 09 tournament leading up to the game. After their visit, Novell Thomas, the producer of the NCAA Basketball game, wrote that \"Hands down, Clemson just set the bar for all hosts of the EA SPORTS Toughest Places to Play, tour.\" The 29-point victory was the largest margin of victory in Clemson history over Maryland, and tied for the largest margin of victory for a Clemson team against an ACC team that advanced to the NCAA Tournament. Clemson defeated Florida State in 1997–98 by 29 points.\nThe Tigers finished the season at 9–7, which gave them back-to-back winning seasons in the conference for the first time since the 1965–66 and 1966–67 teams did it. It is also Clemson's eleventh winning season in the conference since 1953.\nClemson defeated five NCAA tournament teams during the regular season in Duke, Maryland, Boston College, Temple and Illinois. It is the most wins over NCAA Tournament teams in the regular season for the Clemson program since 1997–98.\nClemson finished the regular season with a 14–0 record against non-conference teams, one of just eight Division I teams with a perfect non-conference record. The others were Pittsburgh, UConn, North Carolina, Wake Forest, Minnesota, Illinois State and Stanford.\nThe Tigers won seven regular season ACC games by double digits, the most regular season league wins by 10 points or more in Clemson history. Statistically, Clemson finished the year with a +10.3 average margin of victory, third best in school history. Clemson's .688 free throw percentage was the third best for the program in the last 22 years. Clemson's .374 three-point percentage was the fourth best in school history.\nPostseason.\nACC tournament.\nClemson entered the ACC tournament as the No. 5 seed with a 9–7 record in the ACC Regular Season. The Tigers lost their opening game to No. 12 seed Georgia Tech 86–81 dropping their record to 3–8 all-time in the opening round of the tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nClemson was selected for the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive year, joining Duke and North Carolina as the only ACC schools to make the tournament each of the last two years. It was just the third time in Clemson history that Clemson has gone to the NCAAs in consecutive years. The Tigers opened the tournament in Kansas City, Missouri, as the No. 7 seed in the South Region. Down by double digits against #10-seed Michigan in the first round, the Tigers went on a 14–0 run to make it 58–57 with just over a minute left. Clemson had a chance to tie the game with 13 seconds left, but K. C. Rivers' contested 3-pointer at the buzzer fell short. The 59–62 loss dropped Oliver Purnell to 0–5 all-time in NCAA Tournament games as a head coach.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|ACC Tournament \n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA Tournament \nPlayer statistics.\nFinals Stats\nAwards and honors.\nTrevor Booker\nK.C.

This marks the fifth consecutive year that Clemson has improved its winning percentage from the previous year. Head Coach Oliver Purnell joins former Georgia Tech coach Bobby Cremins as the only coaches in ACC history to take a program to a better winning percentage in five consecutive years. Cremins did it from 1980 to 1981 through the 1986–87 season. The team finished the year with 23 wins, tied for the fifth highest total in school history. The .719 winning percentage ranks in a tie for fourth best in school history and the best since the 1989–90 team was 24–8 for a .750 winning percentage. The 23 victories gave Clemson at least 20 wins for the third straight year, a first in Clemson history. Clemson has 72 wins over the last three years, third among ACC teams behind North Carolina and Duke.\nClemson finished the year ranked 24th in the final Associated Press poll. It marks the second consecutive year Clemson has been ranked in the final AP poll, the first time in history Clemson has finished in the top 25 in any poll in consecutive years. Clemson was ranked in the AP poll for 14 consecutive weeks and in the USA Today poll for 13 consecutive weeks, the second longest streak of weeks in the top 25 in the same season in Clemson history and most since 1996–97 team was ranked in all 19 polls. Clemson reached a high ranking of No. 9 in the USA Today poll on Feb 9, the highest ranking for the program since the 1997–98 season.\nClemson won 10 games away from home, including seven on the opponent's home court. The 10 wins away from home were the most since the 1996–97 team won a record 11. The seven road wins were the most since the 1986–87 team won eight on the opponent's home court. The Tigers posted a 4–4 ACC road record this year, the most ACC road wins in a season for the Clemson program since 1996–97.\nIndividual notes.\nClemson's senior class of K.C. Rivers, Raymond Sykes and Jesse Yanutola finished their careers with 91 victories, a Clemson record for a four-year class. The previous record was 84. The class also had a record 33 ACC regular season wins and 12 ACC road wins. The .679 winning percentage is second best in Clemson history behind the seniors of 1979–80."

        "text": "The 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup was the ninth edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup, held in Australia from 7 to 22 March 2009.\nEngland won the tournament, beating New Zealand in the final to claim their third World Cup title. England batter Claire Taylor was the leading run-scorer and Player of the Tournament, whilst teammate Laura Marsh was the leading wicket-taker. Australia, West Indies, India and Pakistan were eliminated at the Super Six stage, whilst South Africa and Sri Lanka were eliminated in the first round.\nHost selection and venues.\nThe ICC, along with Cricket Australia, announced in July 2008 that six venues in New South Wales would host the tournament. The venues chosen were North Sydney Oval, Bankstown Oval and Drummoyne Oval (all in Sydney), Manuka Oval in Canberra, No. 1 Sports Ground in Newcastle and Bradman Oval in Bowral. In addition, four grounds in Sydney (Manly Oval, Old King's Oval, Raby Oval No. 1 and Village Green) hosted the nine warm-up matches for the tournament.\nQualification.\nSix of the eight teams involved in the tournament qualified through finishing in the top six in the previous tournament; Australia, India, England, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and West Indies therefore qualified automatically for the tournament. The final two places were awarded to Pakistan and South Africa; the two finalists of the 2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\nRules and regulations.\nMatches.\nAll matches started at 10am local time (UTC+11) and were played to standard One Day International playing conditions. All matches were to be 50 overs a side unless stated otherwise by the umpires or match referee, with each bowler entitled to bowl a maximum of 10 overs per match.\nIn the event of bad weather, the side batting second must have batted a minimum of 20 overs for a result to be declared (if the match was not otherwise won, for example if the team batting second was dismissed before the completion of 20 overs). In the event of interrupted matches (due to rain or some other factor), the Duckworth–Lewis method was applied to determine the result or revised target.\nTournament points and format.\nThroughout the group and Super Six stages, two points were awarded to teams for a win, one point for a tie or matches that ended with no result, and no points were awarded for a defeat.\nAt the conclusion of the group stage, the three teams in each group with the most points advanced to the Super Six stage of the tournament (the first time such a stage had been held), while the two teams eliminated played in a 7th/8th place playoff. Points from matches between teams both qualifying for the Super Six stage were carried forward, therefore all six teams to advance began the Super Sixes with two games played. Following the conclusion of the Super Sixes, the top two teams contested the final, third and fourth contested a third-place play-off, while fifth and sixth played each other for fifth place.\nResults.\nGroup stage.\nThe eight qualifying teams were split into two groups for the group stage, with traditional rivals Australia and New Zealand drawn together in Group A alongside South Africa and the West Indies, while India and Pakistan were drawn together in Group B along with England and Sri Lanka. The group stage took place between 7 and 12 March 2009.\nSuper Sixes.\nThe top three teams in each group moved on to the Super Six stage which is scored as a complete round-robin. But each of the six teams played only three new matches, rather than five—each group's three representatives carried forward their result against each other rather than play again. Thus the table, showing five matches for each team, covers all matches between the Super Six qualifiers, including those from the group stage.\nThe top two teams in the final table qualified for the final.\nThe Super Six stage of the tournament took place between 14 and 19 March 2009.\nAwards.\nTeam of the tournament.\nThe day after the final, the ICC announced its World Cup XI, as selected by a panel led by Belinda Clark. The eleven included five members of England's tournament-winning squad, with three coming from India, two coming from runners-up New Zealand and one from Australia.\nNew Zealand's Sophie Devine was named as the side's twelfth man.\nPlayer of the tournament.\nThe award for player of the tournament was selected by the same panel that chose the team of the tournament, and was awarded to the leading run-scorer Claire Taylor."

Brett Jodie, the former Yankee pitcher, now the Patriots pitching coach noticed that Knight's release point was too high. After Knight modified his release point, his command and velocity improved. The Mets decided to purchase his contract and signed him to their Triple-A team (New Orleans Zephyrs) in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nWhile pitching for the New Orleans Zephyrs, Knight was selected to play for the U.S. Olympic team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Knight pitched in two baseball games at the Olympics, earning one win. He earned a bronze medal as part of the U.S. team.\nKnight made his first career major league start in Shea Stadium for the New York Mets on July 26, , against the St. Louis Cardinals. He allowed four runs in the first inning, but settled down, and held the Cardinals scoreless through the next four innings. Though he left the game with the Mets leading 5-4, the bullpen was unable to hold the lead and Knight was denied his first major league win. He was designated for assignment the following day, so that he could remain on the Olympic Roster. He was recalled to the Mets when rosters expanded in September, and he earned his first MLB win later in the year. \nKBO League.\nOn July 24, 2009, the New York Mets released Knight so that he could sign with the Samsung Lions in South Korea.

He is the franchise's current pitching coach.\nPersonal life.\nKnight was born in Oxnard, California. He was raised in Ventura, California, and continues to reside there with his wife Brooke and children."

        "title": "1949 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1949 Rose Bowl was the 35th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Saturday, January 1. The seventh-ranked Northwestern Wildcats of the Big Nine Conference defeated the #4 California Golden Bears, champions of the Pacific Coast Conference, 20–14.\nNorthwestern halfback Frank Aschenbrenner was named the Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nIt was the third Rose Bowl since the Big Nine and PCC made an exclusive agreement to match their conference champions; the Big Nine team won for the third straight year.\nNorthwestern has played in just one Rose Bowl since, 47 years later in January 1996. Until the 2013 Gator Bowl, this was the program's only bowl game win.\nTeams.\nNorthwestern Wildcats.\nNorthwestern had finished 8–2 in the Big 9 Conference, losing only to perennial powerhouses Michigan (0–28) and Notre Dame (7–12). Northwestern blanked UCLA 19–0, Purdue 21–0, and Syracuse 48–0. Northwestern rallied from three turnovers and a 16-point deficit to defeat Minnesota 19–16 as well as defeating Ohio State 21–7, Wisconsin 16–7, and Illinois 20–7. The Big Nine's \"no repeat\" rule prevented two-time champion Michigan from making a consecutive trip to the Rose Bowl, so second-place Northwestern received the invitation to the game.\nCalifornia Golden Bears.\nCalifornia had a perfect record going into the game and had averaged 28 points per game over the course of the season. Although neither team had faced each other before, Coach Waldorf had previously been the Wildcats coach from 1935 to 1946 before leaving for the Golden Bears. Northwestern head coach Bob Voigts was only 33-years-old and had been named an All-American in 1938 playing for Waldorf.\nCalifornia and Oregon both had perfect records in the Pacific Coast Conference. California was undefeated overall, and Oregon's only loss was at undefeated Michigan, that year's national champions, and the Ducks had seven victories in the PCC to Cal's six. Oregon, led by quarterback Norm Van Brocklin and halfback John McKay, opted for a playoff game, but California declined. The tiebreaker format the PCC elected to use was that the championship team be elected by the schools. The PCC had ten members in 1948, six in the Northwest and four in California, so it was assumed that Oregon would be the team playing in the Rose Bowl, as even a 5–5 tie vote would be in their favor. Instead California was voted champion of the PCC, because the University of Washington had persuaded the University of Montana, then a member of the PCC, to vote for California, something that has not been forgotten by Oregon fans. (The PCC allowed a second bowl team that season and Oregon went to the Cotton Bowl, but lost 21–13 to hometown SMU in Dallas.)\nGame summary.\nFrank Aschenbrenner ran 73 yards, the longest touchdown return in Rose Bowl history. In the second quarter, the Wildcats were awarded a touchdown in a controversial call when Art Murakowski fumbled the ball entering the endzone, but missed the point-after. Although Jensen is injured early in the third quarter, Cal mounted a 56-yard drive for a touchdown and point-after giving them a one-point lead.\nIn the fourth quarter, with less than three minutes and 88 yards to go, the Wildcats launched a historic drive: Aschenbrenner made the only complete pass of the game to Stonesifer for 18 yards, followed by a 14-yard run by Perricone, a 5-yard penalty against Cal, and then a Statue of Liberty play and 45-yard run by Ed Tunnicliff for a touchdown. The Bears attempted a passing drive in the last minute, but PeeWee Day intercepted a pass to end Cal's hopes of a title.\nBoth Aschenbrenner's and Jensen's runs were from scrimmage. The final touchdown was a direct snap from center to a running back (Tunnicliff) from a T-formation set."

The series, targeted at an audience of teenagers and young adults, focused on the lives of students from an international school, with a heavy theme of fencing.\nDescription.\nThe four-leaf clover is a symbol of hope, faith, love, and luck. One four-leaf clover brings three young adults together.\nA group of students, bonded by dreams, interests, and friendship, go through a series of events - bringing them closer together and finding themselves in each other.\nThere was once a legend of the Four Fencers. They won every fencing challenge and would bring fame to the small school. However, the day before the fencing finals, the Four Fencers disappeared.\nThe new school year begins and the Fencing Club becomes the talk of the town again with the new members: Ah Lok, Don, Ah Lung, and Ah Yat. The long-forgotten school magazine is also given a whole new look by 5 new members: Lam Lam, Ah Ching, Man Man, Ah Miu, and 13 Mui. With the collision of the two groups, love interests and relationships burst forth.\nAh Lok and Don's constant fighting and vying for Lam Lam's attention becomes a side plot in the series. However, Lam Lam secretly doesn't care for either of them. In fact, she starts to like Ah Yat.\nCharacters.\n-Cheng Ga Lam (Race Wong)\nLam Lam is the main female protagonist, with 3 love interests: Ah Yat, Ah Lok, and Don. She drinks soda as a stress-reliever and hiccups at hearing the word \"water\". Since she was 5, a four-leaf clover has been her good-luck charm.\n-Go Ching (Natalie Tong)\nAh Ching dreams of being a professional artist and loves bringing her camera everywhere, taking pictures of people and celebrities. She has a crush on Don, which makes her Lam Lam's love rival.\n-Lam Suet Man (Elaine Yiu)\nMan Man is a hopeless romantic, constantly with her head in romance novels. She normally wears glasses, but changes her look for Ah Lung.\n-Wong Miu Yee (Renne Dai)\nAh Miu is a foodie. She loves to eat and bake cakes, which brings her closer to Fei Cheung.\n-Tsui Kam Mui (Kelly Fu)\n13 Mui is the school's campus belle with a train of boys desperate for a chance to date her. Her interests include fashion and boys.\n-Au Yeung Yat (Lai Lok-yi)\nAh Yat is Ah Lok's older brother. He puts on a lazy act and scrapes by as an underachiever, but he grows to be very responsible and caring.\n-Au Yeung Lok (Don Li)\nAh Lok is Ah Yat's younger brother and deemed the cutest guy of the school year. He is an overachiever and an excellent fencer, giving him the position of Fencing Club president. He was one of the many love interests of Lam Lam.\n-Gwan Yu Lung (Sam Chan)\nAh Lung is Don's loyal \"servant\" and childhood friend. He comes from a poor background but willingly follows behind Don.\n-Don Chu (Eddie Lee)\nDon is Ah Lung's \"master\". He comes from a rich family, being brought up to be self-centered and materialistic, thinking money can solve everything. He is obviously interested in Lam Lam.\n-Leung Guang Cheung\nFei Cheung is a classmate, who takes an interest in Ah Miu because of her eating habits.\nReception.\nThis series has been heavily criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of fencing techniques and scoring methods. For example, one does not slash repeatedly with a foil, and hits should register immediately without delay."

        "text": "The men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 10–11 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China.\nPrior to the race, the French team was reported to be very confident of its ultimate victory, with world record holder Alain Bernard saying: \"The Americans? We're going to smash them. That’s what we came here for.\"\nTrailing the French team by nearly 6/10th of a second entering the final leg, the U.S. team came from behind to set a new world record and most importantly, to capture the elusive freestyle relay title after 12 years. Diving into the pool at the final exchange, Jason Lezak chased down world record-holder Frenchman Alain Bernard on the 50-metre final length and touched the wall first with a scintillating anchor time of 46.06, the fastest ever split in the event's history, to deliver the foursome of Michael Phelps (47.51, an American record), Garrett Weber-Gale (47.02), and Cullen Jones (47.65) the gold-medal in a world-record time of 3:08.24. Lezak's comeback is often considered to be the greatest the sport has ever seen.\nAfter the 1st three legs, France's Amaury Leveaux (47.91), Fabien Gilot (47.05), and Frédérick Bousquet (46.63) had delivered Bernard a lead of more than a half-second (.59). However, despite producing the 3rd-fastest split of the event, Bernard's time of 46.73 was still 0.67 seconds slower than Lezak's split, leaving the French team with the silver medal in a European record of 3:08.32. Meanwhile, Eamon Sullivan smashed the world record split of 47.24 to hand the Aussies an early lead, but his teammates Andrew Lauterstein (47.87), Ashley Callus (47.55), and Matt Targett (47.25) could not maintain the pace in the succeeding laps to end the race with a bronze-medal time of 3:09.91.\nItaly's Alessandro Calvi (48.49), Christian Galenda (47.49), Marco Belotti (48.23), and Filippo Magnini (47.27) finished fourth in 3:11.65, while the Swedish foursome of Petter Stymne (49.17), five-time Olympian Lars Frölander (48.02), Stefan Nystrand (47.25), and Jonas Persson (47.48) cracked a 3:12-barrier to earn a fifth spot in 3:11.92. Outside the club, Canada's Brent Hayden (47.56, a national record), Joel Greenshields (47.77), Colin Russell (48.49), and three-time Olympian Rick Say (48.44) posted a sixth-place time of 3:12.26, while defending Olympic champions and South African quartet of Lyndon Ferns (48.15), Darian Townsend (48.11), Roland Mark Schoeman (48.32), and Ryk Neethling (48.08) produced a seventh-place effort and an African record of 3:12.66 to lower their standard by more than half a second. Great Britain's Simon Burnett (48.34), Adam Brown (47.75), Benjamin Hockin (48.50), and Ross Davenport (48.28) rounded out the field in eighth place at 3:12.87. Due to the presence of technology suits in the pool, all eight teams completed a historic relay finish under a 3:13-barrier.\nEarlier in the prelims, the U.S. men's team of Nathan Adrian (48.82), Cullen Jones (47.61), Ben Wildman-Tobriner (48.03), and Matt Grevers (47.77) took down the world record of 3:12.23 to cut off their own standard by 23-hundredths of a second.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition.\nNew records and feats.\nIn the heats, the United States team set a world record with a team missing some of America's major stars such as Michael Phelps. France and Australia also went faster than the old record even though they rested Alain Bernard and Eamon Sullivan respectively. During the heats, all five of the continental records were broken.\nIn the final, the United States, France, Australia, Italy, and Sweden teams all finished within the world-record time set by the American team in the heats, the Canada team finished within what was the World record prior to the 2008 Olympics, and all of the teams finished within what was the Olympic record prior to the 2008 Olympics. The world record time was reduced by over 2% during the course of the heats and the final. Italy and Sweden failed to medal despite besting the previous world record.\nThe faster times can also be seen in contrast to the 2004 Olympics in Athens, in which the South African squad took home the gold medal in world-record fashion. South Africa returned all four members of that 2004 relay team to these Olympics, and they even bettered their previous world-record time by 0.51 s, yet they finished a distant 7th place in Beijing. In fact, all 8 teams swimming in the 2008 finals swam faster than South Africa's gold medal swim of 2004.\nIt is also possible for the swimmers in the first leg to break records for the 100 m freestyle. In the heats, Amaury Leveaux of France broke the Olympic record, while the world record fell to Australian Eamon Sullivan in the final. Split times for swimmers not swimming the first leg are ineligible because the incoming swimmer can lean over in front of the blocks and be diving as the preceding swimmer is coming in, whereas the leadoff swimmer is timed from a stationary start. Thus, the world record was Sullivan's, even though five swimmers in the finals alone had faster times, including Jason Lezak, whose 46.06 seconds is the fastest individual leg in a 100 m freestyle or medley relay in history. Two days later, Alain Bernard reclaimed the record for France, recording a 47.20 time in the first semifinal of the 100m freestyle, only to have Sullivan break the record again, winning the second semifinal in 47.05 seconds.\nThe final included a dramatic finish with American Jason Lezak swimming the final 50 meters 0.9 seconds faster than Frenchman Alain Bernard to win the race. He also swam the fastest relay split in history. Dan Hicks and Rowdy Gaines had the call on NBC:"

The American foursome of Phelps (1:43.31, the second fastest split in history), Ryan Lochte (1:44.28), Ricky Berens (1:46.29), and Peter Vanderkaay (1:44.68) blistered the field, and prevailed in a sterling time of 6:58.56 to shave off their standard by almost five seconds from the 2007 World Championships in Melbourne. Earlier in the prelims, Berens (1:45.47) and his teammates David Walters (1:46.57), Erik Vendt (1:47.11), and Klete Keller (1:45.51) registered a top-seeded time of 7:04.66 from heat two to demolish Australia's 2000 Olympic record by 2.39 seconds.\nRussia's Nikita Lobintsev (1:46.64), Yevgeny Lagunov (1:46.56), Danila Izotov (1:45.86), and Alexander Sukhorukov (1:44.65) trailed behind the Americans by over five body lengths to take home the silver in a European record of 7:03.70.

        "title": "Tokyo Stadium (baseball)",
        "text": " was a baseball stadium in Arakawa, Tokyo, Japan. It was the home of the Lotte Orions until they moved to Miyagi Baseball Stadium in Sendai in 1972. The stadium was opened in 1962 and had a capacity of 35,000 people.\nHistory.\nIn 1960, despite the Daimai Orions having won the Pacific League pennant in 1950 and 1960, and having won the Japan Series in the former year. they were getting tired of low attendance figures at Korakuen Stadium. They, at the time, were sharing the stadium with the Yomiuri Giants and Kokutetsu Swallows, who drew much larger crowds. For instance, Giants games regularly sold out, with the smallest attendance figure that year still being a solid 15,000, a weekday game against the Chunichi Dragons. Swallows games would draw a healthy 20,000 people, and would often sell out if the starting pitcher that day was Masaichi Kaneda. The Orions, despite winning the 1960 Pacific League pennant, only drew around 10,000 fans on good conditioned days. In fact, scheduling also favored the Giants and Swallows, relegating the Orions to play on weekdays, if they weren't moved to Kawasaki Stadium to also play second fiddle to the Taiyo Whales. With this, Daiei Film president Masaichi Nagata set out to build a stadium that would surpass Korakuen Stadium.\nThe land the stadium was set to be built was a site of a former silk factory in Arakawa. Nagata would buy the land for ¥1 billion (or $2.8 million in 1960), then poured another ¥2 billion into construction. Construction began in 1961, and was completed in May the following year, opening on June 2, 1962, with every Pacific League team attending. Nagata closed the ceremony by saying to \"please love the Pacific League.\" The Orions would win their first game there the same night, a 9-5 victory over the Nankai Hawks. Both would play a doubleheader the next day, which had a solid attendance figure, 18,000 in the first game, 20,000 for the second, both Orions wins. In fact, things were looking so good, that the Orions refused to entertain the idea of renting the stadium out, something that would be a grave mistake later on, with Nagata being adamant that this stadium was his, and for his company's team, so much so, he changed the name of his team to the Tokyo Orions in 1964. In fact, teams like the Toei Flyers and the Swallows would only use the stadium if their home, Meiji Jingu Stadium, was being used by others, such as the university league Tokyo Big6 Baseball League, or if at that point in the season, the teams were just playing a dead rubber game. \nThe downfall of the stadium began by 1964, when Opening Day only drew 5,000 people. In fact, the Pacific League, thanks to the rise of television, and the fact 2 media giants owned teams in Central League, was facing a downturn in popularity, combined with the rise of the Giants V9 dynasty. This was worsened by the fact that the declining movie and film industry in Japan caused Daiei Film to lose money, heavily combined with the fact Nagata spent ¥3 billion in the stadium as this decline was looming. The stadium's massive lights were also expensive, combined with the fact Japan's electricity at the time was mostly from fossil fuels, and that the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant had just began construction and wouldn't be complete for another 7 years. The aforementioned hubris of Nagata that the stadium was only meant for the Orions meant they were losing out on revenue. The final blow came with the infamous Black Mist Scandal of 1969 and 1970, where ace Fumio Narita was suspended for a month, but by then the team was sold to Lotte, and attendance wasn't getting better, only drawing an average of 8,500 fans despite winning the PL pennant that year, not even selling out a single game that year, only getting close when they clinched the pennant against the Nishitetsu Lions, when attendance recorded was 26,000. The 4 games after that got attendances as low as 800. In fact, aside from games played during the Japan Series, the only even that sold out that year was a wrestling event featuring former Giants pitcher Shohei Baba. The Orions would lose that Japan Series to the Giants, but the majority in attendance were Giants fans, which infuriated Lotte. So after that, they entered a deal to play a 2/3rd of their games in Sendai at Miyagi Baseball Stadium, with the rest being split between Korakuen and Kawasaki. After that, no one wanted to move in there, as the Swallows and Toei Flyers were fine with their venues, and so it sat for 5 years before being demolished in 1977 to build a multi-purpose facility for Arakawa citizens.\nFeatures.\nTaking overall design inspiration from Candlestick Park in San Francisco and Comiskey Park in South Side Chicago, the stadium was given a more open air feel, with the concourses being out in the open, rather than fully enclosed. It wasn't as big as Korakuen, with a maximum capacity of theoretically 35,000, but lowered to 30,700 to abide by fire safety ordinances. Despite the lower capacity, it was far more luxurious, with seats being wider and made of fibre-reinforced plastic, so they wouldn't easily get hot. They also had larger fan concourses, and Japan's first luxury boxes in stadiums. 4 were meant for larger parties, and 1 for VIPs, intent on trying to get the Imperial House of Japan to watch an NPB game, like had happened in Korakuen in 1959. The luxuries extended to even players, as clubhouses were much larger than Korakuen. Catcher Takeo Daigo, in particular, stated that in any other stadium, he couldn't change without bumping into other players. In Tokyo Stadium, he could spin in his chair with his legs out and he wouldn't bump into someone. In fact, when George Altman joined in 1968, they bought a mini fridge and put it in between their lockers. it also featured a feature in most NPB stadiums today, indoor bullpens, and also featured the first infield grass in NPB. It was also the first stadium to be built with light towers as part of the design, rather than them being added later, giving it the nickname \"The Stadium of Light\" by the media.\nThe stadium had some downsides, such as it being narrow due to dimensions in the property. Center field was the standard 120 meters (393 feet), but left and right field was 90 meters (295 feet), not helped by the fact the walls weren't high. Said walls were made of concrete with no padding, instead of wood. It took 4 years for this to cause injury, with pads being added after that. The scoreboard was also smaller compared to other stadiums, so any names with complex Kanji characters would have to be transcribed in Katakana to be easily deciphered from distances. The overall location was also a major downside, as it was located in a working-class neighborhood, so it had great train access, but navigation in the streets when crowds were sold out weren't ideal."

The Championship was held on June 26 and June 27 in Antwerp, Belgium. A messy affair, there was an average of over 10 errors per game due to the low quality of baseball in Europe at that time. Italy took gold, beating Belgium 6-1 and Spain 7-4. Spain won silver despite 8 errors in its loss to Italy. Spain beat Germany by a score of 10-4 in its other contest.

        "text": "Henry Montague Norman Nuuanu Gooding Field (August 18, 1911 – May 23, 1964) was an American football tackle who played professionally for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) from 1934 to 1936. In later life, he was elected and served in the Hawaii State Senate from 1963 to 1964. He was inducted into the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame in 2023.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Wailuku on the Hawaiian island of Maui, his parents were William Herbert Field and Margaret Rebecca Nape Field (died 1943). His father was a British immigrant to the Hawaiian Kingdom in the 1880s who operated the Maui Hotel until 1927 while his mother was of Native Hawaiian descent with links to ruling families of the aliʻi nui (paramount chiefs) of Maui. His uncle was the Hawaiian composer David Nape.\nFrom 1927 to 1930, Field attended Punahou School in Honolulu where he excelled in football, track and swimming. He was captain of the Punahou football team in 1929. He also surfed and paddled with Duke Kahanamoku and won the Outrigger Canoe Club regatta race three years in a row from 1927 to 1931.\nFootball career.\nAfter playing a year of college football at the University of Hawaii, he transferred to and played at Oregon State University from 1932 until 1934.\nProfessionally, he played in 34 games over three seasons for the Chicago Cardinals from 1934 to 1936 and the Los Angeles Bulldogs (AFL) in 1937. Field was chosen as a second-team All-NFL member in his rookie season in 1934 by the \"Chicago Daily News\" and the United Press International.\nPersonal life.\nField returned to Hawaii in the 1940s after a short stint in the film industry where he played minor roles. He coached the Punahou football team from 1941 to 1950. During the attack on Pearl Harbor, his team was on Maui and performed ROTC duties, patrolling the coast of Maui for three weeks before returning to Honolulu.\nIn 1944, Field married Princess Abigail Kapiolani Kawānanakoa, a descendant of Hawaiian royalty and daughter of Prince David Kawānanakoa and Princess Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa. After her death in 1961 there were plans to bury her at a new burial plot at the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna ʻAla where her brother (the last member of the family to be interred here) and parents were buried alongside the last ruling members of the House of Kalākaua. However, Field felt uncomfortable about the prospect of being buried at the Royal Mausoleum alongside her after his own death. Instead he had her buried in the Oahu Cemetery on the Kawānanakoa family plot. After his death, Field was buried next to his wife at the Oahu Cemetery.\nPolitical career.\nField served as a state senator from Maui in the Hawaii State Legislature from 1963 to his death in 1964. He was a Democrat.\nGeorge Ariyoshi, later elected as Governor of Hawaii from 1973 to 1986, served in the senate with Field. Ariyoshi noted: \"He was courageous, intelligent, and caring. If he had lived he would have been one of the leaders of modern Hawaii.\"\nLegacy.\nIn 1980, Field was recognized as an inductee of Athletic Hall of Fame for football, track and swimming at Punahou School, representing the class of 1930. He was also a 2021 finalist for induction into the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame.\nHe was inducted in 2023."

        "text": "The 2009 Royal Rumble was the 22nd annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on January 25, 2009, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2009 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either Raw's World Heavyweight Championship, SmackDown's WWE Championship, or the ECW Championship at WrestleMania 25.\nFive professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main event was the 2009 Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from all three brands. Raw's Randy Orton, the eighth entrant, won the match by last eliminating SmackDown's Triple H, the seventh entrant. The primary match on the Raw brand was John Cena versus John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Cena won to retain the title. The primary match on the SmackDown brand was a No Disqualification match between Jeff Hardy and Edge for the WWE Championship, which Edge won to win his fourth and last WWE Championship. The predominant match on the ECW brand was between Jack Swagger and Matt Hardy for the ECW Championship, which Swagger won to retain. This event also marked the first appearance of Rob Van Dam in WWE since One Night Stand in June 2007.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2009 event was the 22nd event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 25, 2009, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2009, the winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's World Heavyweight Championship, SmackDown's WWE Championship, or the ECW Championship at WrestleMania 25.\nStorylines.\nThe event included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"ECW on Sci Fi\".\nThe main rivalry from the Raw brand played out between John Cena and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) over the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL earned his championship match against Cena after winning a fatal four-way elimination match—a standard match in which the last remaining competitor who has not been eliminated is declared the winner—on the December 29, 2008, episode of \"Raw\" by defeating Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels.\nAnother rivalry from the Raw brand came with Melina challenging Beth Phoenix for her WWE Women's Championship in a singles match. Melina won the opportunity to face Phoenix on the December 29, 2008. episode of \"Raw\" by winning a battle royal, a match similar to the Royal Rumble, though with fewer competitors.\nThe main rivalry from the SmackDown brand incorporated into the Royal Rumble featured Jeff Hardy and Edge, with the two feuding over the WWE Championship. At WWE's previous pay-per-view event, Armageddon, Hardy had defeated both defending champion Edge and Triple H in a Triple Threat match, a standard match involving three wrestlers, to win the WWE Championship. On the January 2, 2009, episode of \"SmackDown\", on-air authority figure Vickie Guerrero announced that Edge would face Hardy for the WWE title at the Royal Rumble.\nThe ECW brand's main rivalry, that between Jack Swagger and Matt Hardy, had the two feuding over the ECW Championship. On the January 13, 2009, episode of \"ECW on Syfy\", Swagger defeated Hardy to capture the ECW Championship. On the January 16 episode of \"Friday Night SmackDown\", WWE announced that Swagger would defend the ECW title against Hardy in a rematch at the Royal Rumble.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match of the evening saw Jack Swagger defend the ECW Championship against Matt Hardy. The match started with both wrestlers countering each other's moves until Swagger injured Hardy's left shoulder and then targeted it for the rest of the match. Swagger ultimately defeated Hardy by pinning him after slamming him to the mat with a gutwrench powerbomb. Swagger thus retained the ECW title.\nThe second match involved the WWE Women's Championship, where Beth Phoenix defended her title against Melina. The match ended when Phoenix attempted the Glam Slam on Melina, but Melina countered into a roll-up pin, to win the Women's Championship.\nMain event matches.\nThe third match on the card pitted John Cena against John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL's employee Shawn Michaels accompanied him to the ring and first got involved in the match when the referee became incapacitated; he came into the ring and performed his Sweet Chin Music finisher both on JBL and Cena. He then left ringside, leaving JBL's arm on top of Cena. Cena however managed to get a shoulder up and performed an Attitude Adjustment to retain his World Championship.\nIn the fourth match, Jeff Hardy defended the WWE Championship against Edge. Before the match began, Vickie Guerrero came out and announced the match to be No Disqualifications. Edge then revealed that Chavo Guerrero would be in his corner. During the match Hardy brought a ladder out and set it up near the Spanish announce table. When Chavo tried to interfere, Hardy put him on the table and jumped off the ladder, connecting with Chavo and breaking the table. Hardy then had the match won when he performed the Swanton on Edge after kicking Vickie off the apron when she tried to interfere. When Hardy went for the pin, Vickie stopped referee Scott Armstrong from making a three count. Jeff's brother Matt then made his way to the ring, placing a chair under Edge's face. Grabbing another chair, Matt at first appeared to be setting Edge up for his own version of Edge's con-chair-to maneuver. He instead hit Jeff in the head with the chair, allowing Edge to then pin Jeff and become the new WWE Champion.\nJim Ross and Jerry Lawler came out to call the main event. The main event consisted of the Royal Rumble match. Rey Mysterio and John Morrison started the Rumble. As Finlay entered at No. 14, Rey Mysterio stepped on the just eliminated John Morrison and The Miz to avoid elimination. Santino Marella entered at No. 28 and was eliminated by Kane in one second. Breaking the Warlord's record for shortest elimination in the Royal Rumble. The final six participants left in the match were The Big Show, The Undertaker, Triple H and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase and Randy Orton). While the Undertaker and Big Show brawled on the outside apron (both went over the top rope, but had not hit the floor), Orton eliminated Big Show with an RKO, causing him to fall off the apron. Big Show eliminated The Undertaker shortly thereafter when he pulled his opponent off the apron by his leg. Despite being at a disadvantage against the Legacy, Triple H eliminated both DiBiase and Rhodes. With Triple H by the ropes, Orton quickly clotheslined him from behind to send him over the top rope and become the winner of the Royal Rumble match.\nAftermath.\nOn the January 26 episode of \"Raw\", The Legacy came out with two lawyers and a therapist. Randy Orton then revealed that he suffers from IED, which causes him to experience violent outbursts when provoked, losing all control of his emotions and actions. According to Orton and his lawyers, Orton had told Stephanie McMahon that if fired, he would not only take DiBiase and Rhodes with him but the whole locker room, as he would bring in a lawsuit against the company.\nThe Raw brand started the qualifying matches for the brand's upcoming Elimination Chamber match at WWE's next pay-per-view event, No Way Out. Three of the qualifying matches saw Kofi Kingston defeat Kane, Rey Mysterio defeat William Regal and Chris Jericho defeat CM Punk to qualify. In a fourth qualification match, Shawn Michaels failed to win a match against John Cena that would have made JBL eligible to participate in the Elimination Chamber.\nThe ECW Championship feud between Jack Swagger and Matt Hardy had officially finished when ECW's on-air authority figure Theodore Long announced on the January 27 episode of \"ECW\" that Hardy had requested a move to the SmackDown brand. Swagger had other problems as his ECW title belt was stolen by Hornswoggle. When Hornswoggle's storyline father, Finlay, urged Hornswoggle to give the title back to Swagger, Swagger shoved Hornswoggle to the ground, which caused Finlay to knock down Swagger with his own championship belt.\nOn the January 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", Matt Hardy proclaimed that he had no remorse about smashing his brother Jeff in the head at the Royal Rumble and costing him the WWE Championship. He then told the universe that he no longer considered Jeff a partner or a sibling. There were three Elimination Chamber qualifiers for No Way Out. The first match being The Undertaker versus Mark Henry, which Undertaker won via submission with the Hell's Gate. The second qualifier match was The Big Show defeating Festus with a K.O. Punch. The last qualifier was a triple threat match featuring Triple H, The Great Khali and Vladimir Kozlov. Triple H won the match after he delivered a Pedigree to Khali to pick up the victory.\nDuring the 2009 WWE Draft, the World Heavyweight Championship and WWE Championship switched brands.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\n Big Show's elimination of Undertaker came after Big Show was eliminated by Randy Orton."

        "title": "Swimming with dolphins",
        "text": "The popularity of swimming with dolphins increased in the 1980s and 1990s, occurring in over 65 countries, both as a form of therapy as well as a tourist activity. Proponents of dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) say that interacting with dolphins can help to treat mental and physical disorders in humans, but there is limited clinical evidence proving its benefits. Marine parks and other tourist destinations offering \"swim-with-dolphin\" experiences have also promoted the purported healing attributes of dolphins. Opponents argue that interactions between humans and dolphins have had a negative impact on dolphin populations both in the wild and in captivity, and that the practice can be dangerous for humans. Concerns over animal welfare have led to bans on swimming with dolphins in Costa Rica, as well as certain locations in New Zealand and Hawaii.\nDolphin-assisted therapy.\nClaims.\nDolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) is a form of animal-assisted therapy (AAT), in which captive dolphins interact with humans with a range of psychological and neurological disorders. DAT is often claimed to help children and adults with autism, as well as other conditions including depression, cerebral palsy, encephalopathy, Down's syndrome, atopic dermatitis, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries, and attention deficit disorder.\nWhile some forms of DAT involve patients swimming with, or being pulled around by, dolphins, others entail simply observing, touching, or feeding them. In general, it is a very expensive form of therapy, costing thousands of dollars in addition to the expense of travel and accommodations to the facilities, located in the United States and Mexico, as well as the Caribbean, South America, Middle East, and Europe. Critics have expressed concern that families are forgoing more effective, scientifically proven therapy and treatments order to be able to pay for DAT.\nOrigins.\nEducational anthropologist Dr. Betsy Smith of Florida International University is usually credited with starting the first line of research into dolphin-assisted therapy in 1971, building on earlier research by American neuroscientist Dr. John Lilly on interspecies communication between dolphins and humans in the 1950s. Smith observed that two wild dolphins, adolescents who were normally aggressive, were surprisingly gentle around her mentally disabled brother, and that his mood and abilities had improved after playing with them. She offered DAT sessions for free, bringing groups of autistic children to Dolphins Plus in Key Largo to swim in the 1980s, and called for more rigorous scientific research into the possible long-term benefits of swimming with dolphins.\nIn 1978, Dr. David Nathanson, an American clinical psychologist born in Glasgow, started language experiments using swimming with dolphins as a motivator in teaching children with Down's Syndrome at Ocean World in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Nathanson found that when children were rewarded with dolphin swims for giving correct responses, they learned four times faster and retained information for longer. From 1988 to 1994, he ran a Dolphin Research Center in Grassy Key, Florida, which proved popular with families who were willing to pay a considerable expense for the therapy; it was even said to have helped some severely disabled children regain speech. In 1995, he moved his Dolphin Human Therapy centre to Key Largo, offering services for disabilities including learning difficulties, brain and spinal cord injuries, blindness, deafness, and other sensory handicaps.\nIn 2003, Betsy Smith publicly renounced DAT, criticizing the fact that it had become driven by monetary gain rather than empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness, and argued that there is nothing unique about using dolphins specifically for the type of behavioral therapy carried out by Nathanson. Smith has stated that DAT programs are undermining valid treatments, and are “taking vulnerable children and vulnerable animals and profiting from them\".\nTheories.\nPossible explanations for why dolphin-assisted therapy works are usually vague, often using scientific terms incorrectly or out of context, and are generally unproven. One of the most popular theories is that when dolphins produce \"clicks\" as part of echolocation, they emit an ultrasound that stimulates the human endocrine and neural systems, helping to heal body tissue and cell structure. There is no scientific evidence supporting this. Dolphins used in DAT do not always echolocate on the patient, and the ultrasound emitted by dolphins is different from therapeutic ultrasound currently used by medical practitioners, which is applied repeatedly at a specific intensity and duration.\nAnother theory is that contact with dolphins has a calming effect and increases relaxation in humans. Analysis of patients' brain wave patterns using electroencephalography (EEG) scans have suggested that DAT produces a temporary \"nonspecific relaxation effect\", but it is unclear how this connects to therapeutic benefits for specific conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\nThe theory promoted by Nathanson and his co-authors is that swimming with dolphins improves attention and responsiveness to external stimuli. In a major review of the literature through 2020, Lori Marino and Scott O. Lilienfeld point out that many of the patients in Nathanson's studies had neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy that are not linked to attention deficits. Even for patients with autism, they argue, \"the minimal nature of the intervention of swimming with dolphins strains credulity as an adequate treatment for such a profound, complex, and lifelong disorder as ASD.\"\nStill other theories have focused on the positive effects of biophilia, or human attraction to nature; a special emotional bond between dolphins and humans; or a \"secret language\" in which dolphins \"communicate acoustically with body movements\" and are sensitive to the movements of children with disabilities. Marino and Lilienfeld argue that these theories are nonspecific, and provide no scientifically plausible mechanism for the effectiveness of DAT in treating specific neurodevelopmental disorders.\nEffectiveness.\nThere are very few scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals examining the efficacy of DAT in treating autism or other conditions. Past studies have been found to have fundamental methodological flaws, such as the lack of control groups, small sample size, lack of randomization, selection bias, and the absence of reliability and validity measurements. Investigator bias has been a problem in studies conducted by Nathanson and others, because most individuals were involved aware of the anticipated or \"desired\" outcomes. Respondent bias has also been a problem in studies where children were selected to participate because their families expressed interested in DAT.\nLikely interference of other treatments and the lack of experimental controls for other factors, such as the warmness of the water, or the novelty of having traveled by plane to a new location, are common problems across many studies. The novelty of dolphins, which most humans don't regularly interact with, is a likely influence on participant behavior as well. Lori Marino of Emory University has stated, \"Dolphin-assisted therapy is not a valid treatment for any disorder\", with no scientific evidence for long-term benefits, and that at best, it affords \"fleeting improvements in mood.\"\nThere is limited clinical evidence that dolphin therapy is effective in treating depression. In 2005, psychiatrists from the University of Leicester published a report in the \"British Medical Journal\" on a study which found that patients with depression experienced significant improvements in mood after swimming and snorkelling with dolphins. During the two-week controlled trial in Honduras, 30 patients discontinued their medical and psychotherapy treatments and participated in water activities instead. Half the group swam and snorkelled alongside dolphins, while the control group swam and snorkelled only with each other. The researchers found that patients who swam with dolphins experienced \"greater elevations of mood and longer-lasting effects\" than those swimming without dolphins.\nIn recent years, interest has grown in virtual reality therapy which simulates swimming with dolphins underwater to reduce the impact of stress for patients with depression, anxiety and psychotic disorders, and other disabilities, and to ease pain for patients in hospital.\nTourist activity.\nSwimming with both captive and wild dolphins has become a popular tourist activity around the world. Fascination with dolphins is deep-rooted in many cultures; wild dolphins appear in stories as mythical or god-like creatures with a symbiotic relationship to humans, for example in the legends of pre-historic Africans, ancient Greeks and Romans, and the Maori in New Zealand. Historical accounts of dolphin-human interaction, particularly around cooperative fishing, have been reported in geographically diverse locations for centuries. During the 20th century, there were many cases of solitary wild dolphins who developed friendships with humans and eventually became tourist attractions themselves.\nModern representations of dolphins in the popular media, such as the 1960s television series \"Flipper\"; depictions of happy people swimming with dolphins in advertisements for holiday destinations; the belief that dolphins love humans and performing for them; the rise of wildlife-adventure tourism; documentaries about dolphin-assisted therapy and the \"healing attributes\" of dolphins; and the proliferation of \"wildlife selfies\" in social media have all contributed to the desirability of the swim-with-dolphins experience.\nCaptive dolphins.\nLarge marine parks in the United States such as Sea World in Florida first started offering a small number of tourists the opportunity to enter their dolphin pools to touch and swim with dolphins in the 20th century. As of 2006, there were approximately 18 facilities for swimming with dolphins in the United States alone.\nIn a typical tourist encounter with captive dolphins, a small group of up to twelve people are briefed about how to behave; upon entering the water, dolphins swim past them. The tourists are then given an opportunity to touch or stroke the dolphins, which perform tricks in exchange for \"rewards\" from their trainers. The highlight for most tourists is \"the feeling of being dragged along while holding on to the dolphin's fins\"; having photos or videos taken during the experience also adds to their enjoyment long afterwards. Tourism industry studies have concluded that while most tourists taking part in swim-with-dolphin activities are impressed with the \"grace, size, and power of dolphins\", they tend to feed back that the experience is too short and too staged, and come away with concerns over the dolphins' welfare in captivity.\nIn Hawaii, captive dolphin attractions have become controversial. While resorts such as The Kahala Hotel &amp; Resort and the Hilton Waikoloa Village offer tourists with the opportunity to swim with dolphins, newer establishments such as the Ko Olina Resort have stated that they will not keep captive dolphins. Dolphin Quest, a company which operates \"swim-with dolphin\" facilities in Hawaii, has argued that income from tourism has helped to fund the scientific study and conservation of marine mammals. Furthermore, they insist that the welfare of dolphins is often better in their care than in the wild, where dolphins are exposed to pollution, disease, injuries from boats, and insufficient food sources.\nWild dolphins.\n, in the Caribbean, there were more than 30 marine attractions offering tourists and cruise ship passengers the chance to swim with dolphins, with similar tourist activities in European tourist destinations including Spain, the Algarve, and the Canary Islands, and across the Middle East and Asia. In many locations, small- and medium-sized tour operators take tourists by boat to look for dolphin pods and swim with wild dolphins, snorkeling freely, or holding onto ropes.\nA study by eco/wildlife tourism researcher Susanna Curtin found that while tourists who swim with wild dolphins consistently feed back that the experience was \"disappointingly brief\", they tend to express feelings of satisfaction from seeing the dolphins in their \"natural setting\".\nImpact on dolphins.\nHealth.\nSwimming with dolphins has resulted in stress, injury, and death for dolphins. Dolphins are often susceptible to similar respiratory ailments as humans, and swimming in confined spaces can add to mental distress and weaken their immune systems. Behavioral and wildlife biologist Toni Frohoff has stated that even if dolphins appear to be enjoying their interaction with humans, they may be \"performing\" out of fear of isolation and punishment.\nPopulation.\nIn the Bay of Islands north of Auckland, New Zealand, the population of wild bottlenose dolphins shrank by 90 percent – from approximately 270 to only 30 – during a period of 20 years. According to the Department of Conservation in New Zealand, boat tours offering passengers the chance to swim with dolphin pods had upset their normal resting and feeding behaviour, and led to a 75 percent mortality rate among calves.\nRisks to humans.\nHumans have been injured while swimming with dolphins, which are not domesticated animals. According to \"National Geographic\" magazine, \"Reports in peer-reviewed papers indicate that dolphins have bitten people, rammed into them, or slapped them with their flukes. Even professional dolphin trainers have been charged, butted, bitten, or held down at the bottom of a tank.\" Dolphins are able to distinguish between men and women, which is a bad thing as they can be sexually aggressive towards women\nAlthough the shape of the dolphins' jaw is interpreted by many humans as \"smiling\", dolphins in captivity may in fact be suffering from distress. Wild dolphins may become aggressive when they swim close to boats anticipating snacks, and don't receive any.\nLegislation.\nIn 2005, Costa Rica banned swimming with dolphins or whales, and made it illegal to keep them in captivity.\nIn 2019, the New Zealand Department of Conservation banned tourists from swimming with bottlenose dolphins in the Bay of Islands region. In 2021, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association (NOAA) in the United States banned tourists and residents from swimming with wild spinner dolphins in Hawaii."

        "title": "Bob Carey (American football)",
        "text": "Robert Winfield Carey (February 8, 1930 – October 25, 1988) was an American football end who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). He was a first-round pick (13th overall) by the Los Angeles Rams in the 1952 NFL Draft from Michigan State University. He played three season with the Rams between 1952 and 1956 and one season with the Chicago Bears in 1958.\nMichigan State University Two Sport All-American.\nCarey earned a total of nine varsity athletic letters at Michigan State: three each in football, basketball and track. In his era, freshmen were not eligible for varsity competition. As captain of the undefeated Spartan 1951 football team, he earned consensus first-team All-America honors at end and was a member of the 1951 College Football All-America Team. Carey had also received All-American recognition in football by the Associated Press in 1950. He was Michigan State's receptions leader for three seasons, 1949–1951. His single season record of eight touchdown catches in 1949 stood for 68 years until Felton Davis III caught 9 TDs in 2017. In 2001, he was chosen as a member of Michigan State's All Time Football Team by Althon Sports. Carey was also the 1951 Big Ten Conference Shot Put Champion. His third-place finish in the shot put at the 1951 NCAA Track &amp; Field Championships placed him on National Collegiate Track Coaches All-American team. He was selected as a charter member of Michigan State's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1992. \n\"The greatest all-around athlete I've ever seen or hope to see.\" -MSU Coach Biggie Munn.\nCarey was competitive in three sports becoming an All American in two, track &amp; field and football.\nCarey was also a three-year starter for the Michigan State basketball team playing for Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Pete Newell.\nSpartan football coach and College Football Hall of Fame member Biggie Munn called Carey \"the greatest all-around athlete I've ever seen or hope to see.\" As a senior at State, he won the Chester L. Brewer Award, given annually to a graduating senior for \"distinguished performance in athletics and scholarship, and for possessing a high degree of character, personality, competitive spirit and other leadership qualities which forecast a successful future.\"\n1952 College All Star Team Selection.\nCarey was selected as a member of the Chicago Tribune's 1952 College All Star Team. Teammates on the All-Star roster included future NFL Hall of Famers Ollie Matson, Frank Gifford, Hugh McElhenny and Les Richter. Played at Soldier Field in front of 88,316 fans, the college stars lost 10–7 forcing the defending NFL champion Los Angeles Rams to come from behind to win. Carey caught a key pass in the All Star's 69-yard first half touchdown drive which temporarily put them in the lead.\n1952 NFL season.\nCarey joined the Rams following the Chicago All Star game. In his first pro campaign he earned five regular season starts. This was despite a Ram roster which included future NFL Hall of Famers Elroy “Crazylegs” Hirsch and Tom Fears. Carey finished the season as the #2 receiver with 36 catches for 539 yards and one TD, a 61-yard catch vs. the Bears at Wrigley Field. He missed his one field goal attempt. The 1952 National Football League season resulted in a tie for the National Conference championship between Detroit and the Rams, requiring a one-game playoff. The Lions prevailed 31–21 in Detroit. Carey caught 3 passes for 30 yards, the longest went for 19. He fumbled once. The next week Detroit went on to defeat the Cleveland Browns in the NFL title game, while Carey married his college sweetheart Lynn Laue. Carey was named Rookie of the Year following the season. \n1953 US Army Service.\nCarey and twin brother Bill were ROTC graduates of Michigan State. In ’53 both were called to service. Bob sat out the fall pro campaign and was stationed at Ft. Benning, Georgia. Following completion of his military obligation he returned to the Rams for the 1954 season.\n1954 NFL season.\nThe Rams squared off against Baltimore away in Memorial Stadium in the season opener. Los Angeles crushed the Colts 48–0 with Carey kicking a 21-yard field goal in the 1st Qtr. He finished the contest with 5 catches for 49 yards. In week two the Rams faced the 49ers in the LA Coliseum. The crowd of 93,621 saw the game end in a 24–24 tie. Early in the contest Carey suffered a serious knee injury. Reconstructive surgery followed, ending Carey’s second NFL season.\nArizona State University assistant football coach.\nFollowing Carey's severe knee injury, he spent 1955 in rehabilitation and was hired as end coach on the staff of eventual College Football Hall of Fame coach Dan Devine at Arizona State. The Sun Devils finished 8–2–1 for the season. Devine went on to serve in head coaching positions at the University of Missouri, the Green Bay Packers and at the University of Notre Dame, where he won a national championship in 1977. Following the '55 Arizona State campaign, Carey rejoined the Rams in LA for the 1956 season.\n1956 NFL season and first retirement.\nCarey rejoined the Rams in August 1956. The receiving corps included “Crazylegs” Hirsch, Tom Fears, Bob Boyd, Leon Clarke and Carey. In another injury plagued season, Carey was limited to seven games, starting four. He finished the campaign with 5 catches for 60 yards and one touchdown, that on a 15 yard pass from Ram QB Bill Wade in the final contest played vs. the Bears in Wrigley Field. Following the season Carey announced his retirement. \nReturn to the NFL and 1958 season.\nIn early 1958 the Chicago Bears acquired rights to Carey who had begun a second career outside of football. Following negotiations with his employer, Bears owner George Halas persuaded him to return to football. Carey, who was living in Chicago, joined the Bears at training camp in Rensselaer Indiana at St. Joseph's College. In ’58 Carey played in 11 games and had one reception made in the Bears 35–41 loss in front of 100,470 fans in the LA Coliseum. That catch proved to be the final of his career. The Bears finished the season 8–4, one game behind eventual World Champions the Baltimore Colts. He finally retired from football at season end electing not to return in 1959. \nCharlevoix MI High School Athletics.\nBob and his fraternal twin brother Bill grew up in an athletic family in northern Michigan. The six Carey brothers were well known in the region. Twins Bob and Bill were members of the legendary 1945 Charlevoix, Michigan football team that went undefeated and unscored upon. Bob stood 6 feet, 5 inches and weighed 215 pounds, while Bill measured in at 6 feet, 1 inch and 190 pounds. Bill himself earned five varsity letters at MSU and was eventually drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in 1952. \nThe 1945 team was coached by Ray Kipke, for whom Charlevoix's football stadium is now named, and the inspiration behind the change in spelling of the school's nickname from Raiders to Rayders. The 1958 Charlevoix squad repeated with an undefeated/unscored upon season coached by Bob's older brother Don Carey, a member of the Michigan High School Coaches Hall of Fame who, along with his brothers, had an outstanding athletic career at Charlevoix. No other high school team in Michigan playing full seasons has ever matched the twin accomplishments of Charlevoix's 1945 and 1958 teams.\nThe 1945 Rayders finished 6–0, with shutouts of Grayling, 25–0; Mancelona, 25–0; Boyne City, 33–0; East Jordan, 24–0; Harbor Springs, 64–0; and Pellston, 58–0. That team also went 8–0, won the conference championship, and finished the season ranked No. 1 in the UPI Class C poll. That team was dominant in its own right, outscoring its opponents 260–19.\nThe 1945 unbeaten/unscored upon team came during a truly golden era of football at Charlevoix that included the 1958 team. In the 15 years from 1945 to 1959, Charlevoix won 11 Northern Michigan Class C Conference championships, six of which were consecutive, and the teams combined for a sensational 92–11–4 record.\nThe 1945 team was composed of Dick Joliffe, Jerry Ypma, Frank Martin, Bill Carey, Bud Fox, Jim Roberts, Bill Joliffe, Don Zietler, Bernie Zietler, Bill Poole, Irving Manville, Nelson Sweitzer, Bob Crain, Dick Hardy, Jack Mol, Bernie Ward Jr., Don Brown, Em Howe, Lyle King, Bob Carey, Vince Olach, Jack Roberts, Cliff Lagerman, Bob Shanahan, Warren Shadko, Dick Donaldson, Arnie Loper, Des Milligan, Jack Kline and Pat Martin. The manager was Chuck Fairbanks, who went on to play football at Michigan State. Fairbanks later served as Head Coach at the University of Oklahoma, the University of Colorado (Boulder) and in the NFL as Head Coach of the New England Patriots.\nMichigan Sports Hall of Fame.\nCarey was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. The organization's mission and vision are \"to honor the outstanding men and women athletes, amateur and professional, whose skills and deeds bring great honor to the State of Michigan.\"\nLater life.\nCarey raised a family of four children with his wife Lynn, eventually settling in the Cincinnati, Ohio suburb of Glendale. His interest in football continued, and he served as an occasional scout for NFL teams. He died after a brief illness in 1988 at age 58."

Only one game is taken into account in determining the award, as each individual game on the schedule is counted as one round.\nThe award began with the EuroLeague 2000–01 season.\nCriteria.\nThe award is not voted on by anyone. It is determined by a statistical formula, called either the Performance Index Rating, or the Performance Index Ranking (PIR) by the EuroLeague, and also known as either Evaluation or Valuation, in some European national domestic basketball leagues.\nThe Performance Index Rating also includes the Blocked Shots Against stat (the number of field goal attempts that a player has blocked). The stat's formula is (Points + Rebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks + Fouls Drawn) - (Missed Field Goals + Missed Free Throws + Turnovers + Shots Rejected + Fouls Committed). The Performance Index Rating stat is not commonly used by the NBA or FIBA. The Performance Index Rating (PIR), is not the same stat as the NBA Player Efficiency (EFF), or the John Hollinger Player Efficiency Rating (PER) or Game Score stats, although it is often mistaken to be.\nPrior to the EuroLeague 2011–12 season, the award was given to the player that had the round's highest PIR score. However, starting with the EuroLeague 2011–12 season, the award's criteria were changed; with the award to go to the player from a winning team, who had the round's highest PIR score. So, a player could have the league's highest PIR score for that round, but not win the round's MVP award, if his team lost their game that.\n2000–01.\nRegular Season\nPlayoffs\n2001–02.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\n2002–03.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\n2003–04.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\n2004–05.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2005–06.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2006–07.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2007–08.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2008–09.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2009–10.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2010–11.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2011–12.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2012–13.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2013–14.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2014–15.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2015–16.\nRegular Season\nTop 16\nPlayoffs\n2016–17.\nRegular Season\nPlayoffs\n2017–18.\nPlayoffs\n2018–19.\nPlayoffs"

        "text": "This page details the EuroLeague's individual season statistical basketball leaders since the 1991–92 season. Under previous EuroLeague competition formats, the \"Regular Season\" stats leaders were not counted as the official league stats leaders in the EuroLeague. Only the \"Full Season\" stats leaders were counted as the official league leaders of the EuroLeague. Therefore, playing solely in the \"Regular Season\" phase of previous EuroLeague season formats, did not qualify a player to be among the league's leaders. To qualify to be among the EuroLeague season stats leaders, a player must play in at least 51% of the possible games that can be played in a given season. \nSeason by season league leaders.\nPoints Per Game.\nSince the beginning of the 1991–92 season:\nRebounds Per Game.\nSince the beginning of the 1991–92 season:\nAssists Per Game.\nSince the beginning of the 1991–92 season:\nSteals Per Game.\nSince the beginning of the 1991–92 season:\nBlocks Per Game.\nSince the beginning of the 2000–01 season:\nAverage Index Rating (PIR).\nSince the beginning of the 2000–01 season:\nSeason statistical leaders by category.\n1991–92.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1992–93.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1993–94.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1994–95.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1995–96.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1996–97.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1997–98.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1998–99.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n1999–00.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\n2000–01 FIBA SuproLeague.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\n2000–01 EuroLeague Basketball.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2001–02.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2002–03.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2003–04.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2004–05.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2005–06.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2006–07.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2007–08.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2008–09.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2009–10.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2010–11.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2011–12.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:\n2012–13.\nPoints per game:\nRebounds per game:\nAssists per game:\nSteals per game:\nBlocks per game:\nAverage Index Rating:"

        "text": "John David Baker (born January 20, 1981) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played for the Florida Marlins, San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). In December 2015, Baker was hired as a Baseball Operations Assistant by the Chicago Cubs \nAmateur career.\nBorn in Alameda, California and raised in Walnut Creek, Baker graduated from De La Salle High School (Concord, California) in 1999 before attending the University of California, Berkeley. In 2000 and 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox, where he received the league's 10th Player award in 2000 and was named a league all-star in 2001. As a junior in 2002, he led the Pac-10 Conference with a .383 batting average and was selected to the All-Pac-10 team.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nBaker was drafted in 2002 by the Oakland Athletics in the 4th round of the amateur draft. He was mentioned several times in Michael Lewis' 2003 book \"\". In March 2007, Baker was traded to the Florida Marlins for minor league first-baseman Jason Stokes.\nFlorida Marlins.\nBaker was called up to the majors on July 9, 2008, after Matt Treanor went on the disabled list. His first major league hit was a solo home run off Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 10. In 2009 to 2010 Baker platooned with teammate Ronny Paulino; Baker played against right-handed pitchers while Paulino played against left-handed pitchers.\nBaker went on the disabled list in May 2010 with a strained flexor tendon in his right arm. At the end of the 2010 season, he had Tommy John surgery when the elbow did not improve. He spent most of 2011 rehabbing and rejoined the Marlins that September, serving primarily as a pinch hitter.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn November 22, 2011, Baker was traded to the San Diego Padres for Wade LeBlanc. Baker served as backup to Nick Hundley and Yasmani Grandal in 2012, starting 52 games and batting .238 while throwing out 16% of base runners. In 2013, he began the year as the backup to Hundley. He started 12 games for the Padres in April and May, and then was optioned to the Triple-A Tucson Padres when Grandal returned from his 50-game suspension. He was designated for assignment on June 10, 2013.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nBaker was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 15, 2013 and optioned to AAA Albuquerque. He was outrighted off the 40 man roster on August 5. In 40 games with the Isotopes, he hit .203. He became a free agent on October 1.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn December 13, 2013, Baker signed a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training with the Chicago Cubs. Baker won the backup catcher job out of spring training when George Kottaras was released. On July 29, 2014, Baker pitched a scoreless top of the 16th inning with a popout and double play, as the Cubs had exhausted their bullpen in a game against the Colorado Rockies. In the bottom half of the inning, he walked from a full count, then reached third with the bases loaded and one out. He scored the winning run on a lineout by Starlin Castro, earning him the win in the longest game, by time, in Cubs history. Baker became the fourth position player to earn a win since 1968, and first since Chris Davis did so in 2012. John is the only Cubs position player to ever be credited with a pitching win in the history of the franchise.\nSeattle Mariners.\nBaker signed a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners on January 29, 2015. He was released on May 20, 2015.\nCoaching career.\nBaker joined the Chicago Cubs in 2015 as a special assistant with the baseball operations department. In his time with the Cubs, he spent time as the mental skills coordinator and head applied mental skills coach. On November 10, 2020, it was announced that the Pittsburgh Pirates had hired Baker as the director of coaching and player development.\nPersonal life.\nDuring the offseason, Baker has taught Physical Education at St. Isidore School in Danville, California, where his wife, Meghan, used to teach.\nBaker enjoys broadcasting. He had a stint as a co-host with Rick Tittle on the Sports Byline USA radio network.\nBaker is a philanthropist who was nominated for the Roberto Clemente Award.

        "title": "Daniel Murphy (baseball)",
        "text": "Daniel Thomas Murphy (born April 1, 1985) is an American former professional baseball second baseman and first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Washington Nationals, Chicago Cubs, and Colorado Rockies. While primarily a second baseman, he also played first base, third base, and left field. Murphy was an MLB All-Star in 2014, 2016, and 2017.\nEn route to leading the New York Mets to their fifth World Series appearance in franchise history, he won the National League Championship Series MVP Award in 2015, setting a record for consecutive postseason games with a home run with six.\nEarly life.\nDaniel Murphy was born in Jacksonville, Florida, to Tom and Sharon Murphy. Murphy has a younger brother, Jonathan, and a sister, Tricia. Murphy began playing baseball at the age of five years and played his high school ball at Englewood High School in Jacksonville. Jacksonville University was the only four-year school to offer Murphy a scholarship.\nCollege baseball.\nMurphy attended Jacksonville University, where he played college baseball for the Dolphins under head coach Terry Alexander. In college, he was regarded as a strong hitter, but a below-average fielder. As a freshman, when asked to introduce himself and name what position he played (implying his defensive position), Murphy instead gave his preferred position in the batting order: \"I'm Daniel Murphy from Jacksonville and I hit third.\" He mostly played third base but was also slotted into right field to minimize the defensive liability. As a junior in 2006, Murphy posted a .398 batting average en route to being named the A-Sun Baseball Player of the Year.\nProfessional baseball career.\nNew York Mets.\nThe New York Mets selected Murphy in the 13th round, with the 394th overall pick, of the 2006 MLB draft. The first two months of Murphy's professional career were spent rehabilitating a knee injury he suffered late in his college career. He spent the entire 2007 season with the High-A St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League.\n2008–11.\nMurphy began the 2008 season with the Double-A Binghamton Mets. On August 2, a day after being promoted to the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs, the Mets left-handed reserve outfielder Marlon Anderson was placed on the disabled list, and Murphy was called up to the majors. In his first major league at bat, against three-time All-Star Roy Oswalt, Murphy hit a single. Later in the same game, he made a difficult catch against the left field wall, throwing out Hunter Pence at second base for a double play to end the inning. As of August 9, 2008, Murphy was only the fifth Mets rookie to record 10 hits in his first 20 at bats. Murphy hit his first home run in the bottom of the sixth inning against the Florida Marlins at Shea Stadium on August 9. He finished the season batting .313, with two home runs and 17 runs batted in (RBIs).\nAlthough he is a natural third baseman, Murphy began to play left field in 2008, and continued in 2009, due to the presence of David Wright on the Mets. Murphy had a hard time transitioning to left field. In May, Carlos Delgado underwent hip surgery and Murphy moved to first base. Murphy led the Mets in home runs, with 12. This tied 1977 as the season with the fewest home runs to lead a Mets team in franchise history.\nOn March 30, 2010, Murphy hurt his knee in a spring training game against the St. Louis Cardinals in a rundown between third base and home plate. On June 2, while playing second base for the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, he suffered a \"high-grade\" MCL tear while trying to turn a double play. Although surgery was not needed, he was expected to miss 4–6 months. \nThe following year, Murphy suffered a season-ending injury to his MCL on August 7, 2011 after a collision with the Atlanta Braves' José Constanza.\nAt the time of his season-ending injury, Murphy had the 3rd highest batting average in the National League. However, Murphy did not have enough at-bats to qualify as a league leader at the conclusion of the 2011 season.\n2012–2014.\nMurphy began the 2012 season as the Mets' starting second baseman after recovering from his MCL injury from 2011. On April 9, he hit a walk-off single against the Nationals to give the Mets a 4–3 victory, and their first 4–0 start since 2007. After going 352 at-bats since his last home run on July 16, 2011, Murphy hit two against the Cubs on June 27. Murphy was named as the Mets nominee for the 2012 MLBPAA Heart &amp; Hustle Award, which was ultimately won by Mike Trout of the Angels.\nMurphy had a strained muscle on his right side during spring training. He returned to training on February 20, said he didn't have a timetable for his return to regular workouts. For the period ending September 1, Murphy was named the National League Player of the Week after accumulating five doubles, seven runs and thirteen hits. Murphy had a strong 2013, establishing himself as one of the best offensive 2nd basemen in the league. Murphy played in 161 games and batted .286. Murphy finished 2nd in the National League with 188 hits. Murphy also contributed 13 home runs and 78 RBIs. Murphy led the National League in stolen base success rate, swiping 23/26 bases, an 88.4 percent success rate. Following the season, he was again nominated for the MLBPAA Heart &amp; Hustle Award, this time losing out to Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia. Murphy was named to his first Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2014 as the backup to starter Chase Utley. His roster position was announced on July 6, at which time he had 105 hits (second in the National League) and a .295 batting average.\n2015.\nIn 2015, after an injury to David Wright, Murphy was moved to third base on June 4. He spent the regular season splitting his time between first base, second base, and third base. Murphy hit the 225th and 226th doubles of his career in a game against the Atlanta Braves on September 22, giving him the second-most doubles in Mets franchise history, ahead of Ed Kranepool and behind David Wright. In the deciding fifth game of the 2015 National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Murphy had three hits, including the game-winning home run in the sixth inning, to lead the Mets to a 3–2 win. He had also scored the Mets' second run of the game, after singling, going first-to-third on a walk, and scoring on a sacrifice foul-out. For the entire NLDS, Murphy had five RBI and seven hits in 21 at-bats, three of them being home runs and one of them being a double, giving him a 1.143 OPS.\nOver the course of the NLDS and 2015 National League Championship Series (NLCS), Murphy became the first person in major league history to hit a home run in six consecutive postseason games, beating a record set by Carlos Beltrán, and became the second person, after Lou Gehrig, to have a hit, a run, and an RBI in seven consecutive postseason games. He also broke a Mets franchise record for most home runs in the postseason, previously held by Mike Piazza. He hit .529 with four home runs, a double and six RBI and was named the 2015 NLCS MVP.\nDuring the eighth inning of game 4 of the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Murphy made a key fielding error which increased Kansas City's chances of winning the game by 32 percentage points. The Royals went on to win 5–3. Murphy tallied two errors and only three hits in his 20 at-bats as the Mets lost the Series in five games.\nDuring the off-season, the Mets offered Murphy a one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer. On November 13, 2015, Murphy rejected the offer, thus becoming a free agent. This ensured the Mets a compensation draft pick if he signed with another team.\nWashington Nationals (2016–2018).\nOn December 24, 2015, Murphy agreed to a three-year, $37.5 million contract with the Washington Nationals. The New York Mets gained a draft pick from the Nationals since Murphy turned down New York's one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer. The Mets got a compensation pick between the first and second rounds.\nOn May 2, 2016, Murphy recorded his 1,000th career hit in a game against the Kansas City Royals.\nOn June 5, 2016, Murphy was selected to his second all-star game. He was nearly voted a starter by fans, losing to the Cubs' Ben Zobrist by just 88 votes. In 142 games, Murphy finished the year with a .347 batting average, 25 home runs, and 104 RBI. He also led the NL in doubles (47), slugging percentage (.595), and on-base-plus-slugging (OPS) percentage (.985). He won his first Silver Slugger Award, being named the best offensive National League second baseman of 2016. He finished second in the NL MVP voting behind Kris Bryant. On September 20, 2016, Murphy was the last batter that Marlins pitcher José Fernández faced in the major leagues; Fernández died in a boating accident five days later.\nThe following year, Murphy was voted in as a starter in his third all-star game. In 144 games, Murphy finished the year with a .322 batting average, 23 home runs, and 93 RBI, despite battling a knee injury for at least part of the season. His batting average was best among National League second basemen and second-best in the National League overall, and his .928 on-base-plus-slugging (OPS) percentage was the best by a National League second basemen and more than 130 points higher than the next-best OPS among them. He won his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award, being named the best offensive National League second baseman of 2017.\nMurphy underwent microfracture surgery on his knee in the off-season, and began the 2018 season on the 60-day disabled list. On June 12, 2018, he was activated off of the disabled list.\nChicago Cubs (2018).\nOn August 21, 2018, Murphy was traded to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for minor league infielder Andruw Monasterio and either a player to be named later or cash.\nColorado Rockies (2019–2020).\nOn December 21, 2018, Murphy signed a two-year, $24 million contract with the Colorado Rockies with a $12 million option for the 2021 season. In 2019 he batted .279/.328/.452.\nOn October 28, 2020, Murphy was one of 147 players who were declared a free agent at the conclusion of the 2020 Major League Baseball season. There was no official word which side declined to exercise his option for the following season. He instead received a $6 million buyout, and ended his Rockies career with a batting line of .269/.316/.426.\nOn January 29, 2021, Murphy announced his retirement at the age of 35.\nLong Island Ducks (2023).\nOn March 29, 2023, Murphy came out of retirement and signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 37 games for the Ducks, Murphy batted .331/.410/.451 with 2 home runs and 19 RBI.\nLos Angeles Angels (2023).\nOn June 12, 2023, Murphy signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels organization. He played for the Salt Lake Bees, appearing in 38 games and batting .295/.379/.362 with 1 home run and 25 RBI. On August 15, Murphy again retired from professional baseball.\nBroadcasting.\nMurphy signed on to announce some Mets' games, backing up regular announcers, for 2024 Spring Training.\nPersonal life.\nDaniel's younger brother, Jonathan, also played college baseball at Jacksonville University as an outfielder and was selected in the 19th round (580th overall) of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft by the Minnesota Twins. In August 2014, the Twins organization released Jonathan from the Cedar Rapids Kernels.\nIn 2011, Murphy appeared with fellow Major Leaguers Shane Victorino and Clay Buchholz on a special Veterans Day episode of the ABC series \"\".\nMurphy married his longtime girlfriend, Victoria \"Tori\" Ahern, on December 1, 2012, in Florida. The couple have three children; two sons and a daughter. \nWhen Daniel Murphy took a three-day leave of absence from the team to attend the birth of his child, something guaranteed by the MLB collective bargaining agreement, he received heavy criticism from New York City radio commentators Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton on their show for doing so. While they were roundly criticized for their comments—including a statement by Mets manager Terry Collins where he told them to \"look in the mirror\"—Murphy himself said only that he was aware of the comments.\nOn June 9, 2014, Murphy was invited to speak at the Working Families Summit at the White House.\nIn March 2015, Major League Ambassador for Inclusion, Billy Bean, visited the Mets spring training clubhouse. Murphy, a devout Christian, made controversial comments when he remarked on Bean, who is gay: \"I do disagree with the fact that Billy is a homosexual. That doesn't mean I can't still invest in him and get to know him\" and \"You can still accept them but I do disagree with the lifestyle, 100%.\" The next day Bean responded in an article on MLB.com, \"I appreciate that Daniel spoke his truth. I really do. I was visiting his team, and a reporter asked his opinion about me. He was brave to share his feelings, and it made me want to work harder and be a better example that someday might allow him to view things from my perspective, if only for just a moment.\" Murphy announced the same day he would no longer talk to the media about his religious beliefs, and said he would \"stick to baseball.\""

In his debut with the Philadelphia Phillies he collected his first hit against the Atlanta Braves.\nAfter playing 38 games he collected 19 hits with 2 home runs and 6 runs batted in.\nCareer.\nGlenn Murray was drafted in the second round of the 1989 free-agent draft by the Montreal Expos. After spending several seasons in the Expos minor league system, Murray was traded by Montreal to the Red Sox on March 23, 1994 for Derek Vineyard. Murray's stay in the Red Sox organization lasted until January 1996 when the Boston Red Sox sent him, with Ken Ryan and Lee Tinsley, to the Philadelphia Phillies for Rick Holyfield, Heathcliff Slocumb and Larry Wimberly.\nGlenn Murray's last major league game came on July 24, 1996. In October of that season, Murray was claimed on waivers by the Cincinnati Reds.\nOn May 20, 1998, Glenn Murray was part of an unusual feat in baseball while playing for AAA Indianapolis Indians in a game against Pawtucket. In the 5th inning of the game, Pete Rose Jr. hit a solo home run, Jason Willims hit a 3-run home run, Murray added a grand slam, and Guillermo Garcia completed the \"homer cycle\" with a 2-run shot.

        "text": "John Davison Holland Jr. (February 18, 1910 – July 15, 1979) was an American baseball executive who served as general manager of the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball from 1956 to 1975.\nEarly career.\nThe Wichita, Kansas, native was a former minor league catcher who had toiled as an executive in the Cub farm system for the Visalia Cubs of the California League, Des Moines Bruins of the Western League, and Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League — then the Cubs' top farm team.\nGM during 'College of Coaches' era.\nHolland was promoted from the PCL Angels to succeed Wid Matthews as general manager of the Cubs after the end of the 1956 season. He brought with him Bob Scheffing as the Cubs' new manager. Scheffing, a former Cub catcher and coach, had won the PCL pennant with the Angels in 1956. But the Cubs were in the midst of a two-decade-long tenancy in the second division of the National League.\nAfter Scheffing and his successors, Charlie Grimm and Lou Boudreau, could not rouse the club from its doldrums, owner Philip K. Wrigley decided on a radical departure after the 1960 season: the Cubs became the only team in the history of Major League Baseball to dispense with the position of field manager. Wrigley's College of Coaches employed a series of rotating (and then more permanent) \"head coaches\" from 1961 to 1965. In 1963, the experiment seemed to hold promise, as head coach Bob Kennedy led the team to an 82–80 finish, the Cubs' first winning record since 1946. But they reverted to losing seasons in 1964–65, and the College of Coaches experiment was abandoned at the end of the 1965 season, when Leo Durocher was hired to manage the Cubs.\nHolland made perhaps the most notorious trade in Cubs' history during the same period. He traded talented young outfielder Lou Brock to the St. Louis Cardinals for righthanded pitcher Ernie Broglio in June 1964. Brock came into his own that season, helping the Cardinals to a World Series triumph, going on to be part of two more pennant winners and one more World Series winner before his Hall of Fame career ended. Broglio, an 18-game-winner in , turned out to have elbow problems that would require off-season surgery in 1964 and ended his major league career within two years.\nBuilt contending late-1960s team.\nThe team of Durocher and Holland floundered in 1966, when the Cubbies finished dead last in the National League. But beginning in 1967, the Cubs jumped into contention in the NL with a series of first division ballclubs and six straight above .500 campaigns, led by four Baseball Hall of Famers — Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins, Ernie Banks and Ron Santo — and featuring other stars like Glenn Beckert, Don Kessinger and Randy Hundley. Banks was already a mainstay with the Cubs by 1956, but Holland's scouts (including the legendary Buck O'Neil) had signed and developed Williams, Santo and Kessinger, and Holland acquired Jenkins, Hundley and Beckert through trades and the Rule 5 draft.\nThe 1969 Cubs broke from the gate quickly and appeared headed for the National League East Division championship but were overtaken by the \"Miracle\" New York Mets. That team, which finished at 92–70 and eight games out of the division lead, proved to be the most successful outfit of the Holland era, as the Cubs gradually sank back in the NL East standings, reverting to their losing ways in 1973. Holland retired two seasons later and was replaced by E. R. \"Salty\" Saltwell, the Cubs' longtime treasurer.\nJohn Holland died in Chicago at the age of 69."

        "title": "Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race",
        "text": "The men's road race, a part of the cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics, took place on August 9 at the Urban Road Cycling Course in Beijing. It started at 11:00 China Standard Time (UTC+8), and was scheduled to last until 17:30 later that day. The course ran north across the heart of the Beijing metropolitan area, passing such landmarks as the Temple of Heaven, the Great Hall of the People, Tiananmen Square and the Beijing National Stadium. After rolling over relatively flat terrain for north of the Beijing city center, the route entered a decisive circuit encompassing seven loops on a section up and down the Badaling Pass, including ramps as steep as a 10 percent gradient.\nThe race was won by the Spanish rider Samuel Sánchez in 6 hours, 23 minutes, 49 seconds, after a six-man breakaway group contested a sprint finish. It was the first medal in the men's individual road race for Spain. Davide Rebellin of Italy and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, finishing second and third place with the same time as Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The hot and humid conditions were in sharp contrast to the heavy rain weathered in the women's road race the following day.\nThe event was one of the earliest to be concluded at the 2008 Summer Olympics, taking place on the first day of competition. Concerns were raised before the Olympics about the threat of pollution in endurance sports, but no major problems were apparent in the race.\nIn April 2009, it was announced that Rebellin had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA, a third-generation form of erythropoietin) during the Olympics. After his B-sample subsequently confirmed initial results, he returned his medal and repaid the prize money he had won from the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) while still maintaining his innocence. Cancellara and original fourth-place finisher Alexandr Kolobnev were later awarded new medals corresponding to their updated finishing positions. Kolobnev's bronze was Russia's first medal in the event.\nQualification.\nQualification for the race was restricted to five athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), providing that these athletes qualified through the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) rankings, with the UCI ProTour considered to be superior to the UCI Continental Circuits. The number of qualification places allocated varied among the different UCI tours, which all maintain their own ranking system. Any NOC unable to fill its quota of athletes from the ProTour was permitted to enter athletes from one of the continental tours, and if that was not feasible, from the \"B\" World Championship. The number of places allocated to each tour were thus (in descending order): 70 riders from the ProTour, 38 from the Europe tour, 15 from the America tour, nine from the Asia tour, five from the Africa tour, and three from the Oceania tour. Five entrants qualified through the \"B\" World Championships.\nThe final number of competitors was set to be 145, but only 143 athletes started the race. Four cyclists were scratched from the race shortly before it took place. Damiano Cunego of Italy had not yet recovered from the injuries he sustained in the 2008 Tour de France, so he was replaced by Vincenzo Nibali. Portugal's Sérgio Paulinho, the silver medalist at the 2004 event, was said to be in insufficient shape to race. After Russian Vladimir Gusev was fired by his professional team for failing an internal doping check, he was replaced in this event by Denis Menchov, who later competed in the time trial. While training earlier in the week before the race, Switzerland's Michael Albasini crashed and broke his collarbone; there was not sufficient time to find a replacement for him.\nPreview.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; the time trial had been re-introduced in 1996 alongside the road race.\nPollution issues.\nPrior to the opening of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the organizing body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.\nIndependent sources showed that pollution levels were above the limit deemed safe by the World Health Organization on August 9. However, the cycling event went ahead as scheduled with no objections from the athletes. Fifty-three of the 143 cyclists pulled out during the race; however, this is not unusual (over half withdrew mid-race at the 2004 Summer Olympics). Post-race, a number of riders highlighted the punishing conditions, in particular the heat () and humidity (90%), which were much higher than in Europe, where the majority of UCI ProTour races are held. Pollution, however, was not widely cited as a problem, though Stefan Schumacher of Germany, who had been considered an outside favorite for victory in the event, said the elements and the pollution played a role in his withdrawal.\nPre-race favorites.\nAmong the pre-race favorites was the entire Spanish contingent of riders. It included two winners of Grand Tours in Alberto Contador and Carlos Sastre, along with highly regarded countrymen Alejandro Valverde, winner of the 2008 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the reigning Spanish national road race champion, and Samuel Sánchez, who had won three stages in the 2007 Vuelta a España. They also had 2008 Tour de France points classification winner and three-time world champion Óscar Freire available to work on their behalf. Valverde was seen as the strongest threat among the Spaniards. Other medal hopefuls included the defending Olympic champion Paolo Bettini of Italy, Germany's Stefan Schumacher, and Australian Cadel Evans, twice a runner-up in the Tour de France (2007 and 2008). It was thought that members of the overall strong squads from Germany and Luxembourg could also contend for victory. The German team contained Schumacher and many veterans of Grand Tours such as Jens Voigt to work in support, while Luxembourg had the Schleck brothers Andy and Fränk, along with Kim Kirchen, all of whom had worn leader's jerseys during the 2008 Tour de France.\nCourse.\nThe Urban Road Cycling Course (one of Beijing's nine temporary venues) was in its entirety, and the men's race was a distance of , the longest in Olympic history. The race's starting line was located at the Yongdingmen, a reconstructed gate of Beijing's old city wall, which is a part of the Dongcheng District south of Beijing city center. The course ended at the Juyong Pass in the Changping District.\n The route passed through a total of eight districts: Chongwen, Xuanwu, Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Changping, and Yanqing. The course's scenery, described by \"The Guardian\" newspaper (UK) as \"visually sumptuous\", included landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven, the Great Hall of the People, Tiananmen Square, the Yonghe Temple, and sections of the Great Wall of China, which were passed through as the course journeyed from urban Beijing into the countryside. It also passed the architecture of the 2008 Olympics, including the Beijing National Stadium and Beijing National Aquatics Center (known colloquially as the \"Bird's Nest\" and \"Water Cube\").\nThe men's race layout, which differed most significantly from the women's in that it was over double its length, saw the riders make seven loops back-and-forth between the Badaling and Juyong Passes. The early sections of the race took place within central Beijing; consequently, the gradient of this part of the race was relatively flat. At approximately the point in the race the riders reached the Badaling section of the Great Wall, and began their first of seven loops. The riders encountered an increase in the gradient at this point, with the Badaling Pass gaining in elevation over a distance of from the start of the circuit to the highest point. From there the cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards the Juyong Pass. The final of the race gave the riders a moderately steep climb to contend with, which was designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders have been grouped together at the end of the race, as there were.\nDue to security regulations put in place by the Olympic organizers, no spectators were permitted to stand roadside along the course. This decision proved to be controversial: several prominent figures in cycling, including UCI president Pat McQuaid and riders Stuart O'Grady and Cadel Evans (both Australia), spoke out against it. McQuaid and O'Grady both felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but they were not.\nRace.\nThe men's road race began at 11:00 local time (UTC+8) and within of the start, Horacio Gallardo (Bolivia) and Patricio Almonacid (Chile) formed a two-man breakaway. They held a maximum advantage of 15 minutes, but were never really seen as a threat, and in fact neither went on to finish the race. With no single team willing to force the pace, a 26-man breakaway formed at the mark, including Carlos Sastre (Spain), Kim Kirchen (Luxembourg), Jens Voigt (Germany), Roman Kreuziger (Czech Republic) and Simon Gerrans (Australia). Shortly after the race reached the finish line to begin the first of seven loops, Gallardo was dropped by Almonacid. The lone Chilean leader was then caught by the now 24-man chase group at the summit on the second loop, after riding solo ahead of the pack for over an hour and a half.\nUnder the impetus of Sastre and Kreuziger in particular, the 24-strong breakaway group built their lead to over six minutes at the half-way point of the race, after four of the seven circuits. At that point, the Italian-paced main field increased its speed in order to bring them back. Aleksandr Kuschynski (Belarus) and Ruslan Pidgornyy (Ukraine) went clear of the leading group afterward and gained an advantage of a minute and 40 seconds over the Sastre group and 2 minutes, 45 seconds over the main field by the start of the fifth lap over the hilly circuit. The Sastre group was absorbed by the main field at the to go mark, leaving just Kuschynski and Pidgornyy out front. Not long after, shortly before the end of the fifth circuit, Marcus Ljungqvist (Sweden), Rigoberto Urán (Colombia) and Johan Van Summeren (Belgium) attacked from the peloton and reeled in Kuschynski and Pidgornyy.\nThe next attack, one that would later be described as \"audacious\" and \"brave\", came from Christian Pfannberger (Austria), who went free of the main field toward the end of the sixth lap. His maximum advantage never grew to more than a minute, but he did stay away until well into the seventh and final lap, being caught with to go. Within five minutes of fierce attacks, fewer than 20 riders were left in the front group, a group that included Cadel Evans (Australia), Levi Leipheimer (United States), Santiago Botero (Colombia), and Jérôme Pineau (France), with Valverde and Bettini left behind them. Five riders, Samuel Sánchez (Spain), Michael Rogers (Australia), Davide Rebellin (Italy), Andy Schleck (Luxembourg), and Alexandr Kolobnev (Russia), came further clear from the group of now 13 due to repeated attacks from Schleck. Sánchez, Rebellin, and Schleck reached the summit of the Badaling climb, with to race, 10 seconds ahead of Rogers and Kolobnev, and 26 seconds ahead of the Evans group. Bettini, Valverde and Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) attacked from the main peloton and joined the Evans group at the top of the climb. The leading group's advantage over the two-man chase was 15 seconds with to go.\nWith left, Cancellara attacked from the Evans group and caught up with the chasers that the group of three had left behind, Kolobnev and Rogers. The three of them successfully bridged the gap to the leaders with about to go, and there were six riders contesting the final sprint. Sánchez won the gold medal, Rebellin the silver, and Cancellara the bronze.\nDoping incident.\nIn April 2009, the IOC announced that six athletes had tested positive during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, one of them a medal winner. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that Davide Rebellin was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request for the analysis of the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with Stefan Schumacher, were confirmed as having tested positive. Schumacher was already serving a ban after testing positive in the 2008 Tour de France, but faced further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned his silver medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.\nRebellin had appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the decision to remove his silver medal, but in July 2010, this was rejected.\nThere had been controversy in the months before the men's road race when, in the aftermath of doping revelations at the Tour de France, International Olympic Committee vice-president Thomas Bach had suggested that the men's road race's place in the Olympics should be reconsidered, and said that the credibility of the sport had been damaged; although he clarified that there was no immediate threat. Pat McQuaid had reacted angrily to these comments, saying, \"Why should they [the majority of cyclists] be threatened because of a few bad apples?\"\nFinal classification.\nA total of 142 riders have been qualified in the event at these Games. Most of them are not expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.\nSource: Official results"

        "text": "The women's road race was one of the cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. It took place on 10 August 2008, featuring 66 women from 33 countries. It was the seventh appearance of an Olympic women's road race event and featured a longer course than any of the previous six races. The race was run on the Urban Road Cycling Course (one of Beijing's nine temporary venues), which is total. Including a second lap around the final circuit, the total distance of the women's race was , less than half the length of the men's race.\nHeavy rain during most of the race made conditions difficult for the competitors. A group of five broke away during the final lap and worked together until the final sprint, where Nicole Cooke won the race. Cooke earned Great Britain's first medal at these Games and 200th Olympic gold medal overall. Emma Johansson of Sweden and Tatiana Guderzo of Italy, finishing second and third place with the same time as Cooke, received silver and bronze medals respectively.\nThe race marked the first positive drug test of the 2008 Olympic Games, by María Isabel Moreno of Spain. She was scheduled to compete in this event and the time trial to follow, but left Beijing on 31 July, before the race. The International Olympic Committee said on 11 August that she had tested positive for EPO. This left 66 cyclists to compete, one fewer than in 2004.\nQualification.\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics marked the seventh appearance of an Olympic women's road race event. Qualification for the race was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC) for the 16 top-ranked countries in overall Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) standings at 1 June 2008, and a maximum of two athletes each for the countries ranking 17–24. An NOC with an athlete in the top 100 at 31 May 2008 received a place, which was taken from the countries ranked 17–24 in reversed order, provided that these athletes qualified through the UCI World Tour rankings. Additionally, three places were available at the B World Championship for NOCs that did not qualify through the UCI standing; Gu Sun-Geun, Hae Ok-Jeong and Thatsani Wichana secured Olympic qualification for their NOCs in this way, but only the first was chosen by her national committee to compete. The maximum quota of the event was set at 67 cyclists, and as of 5 June, 66 cyclists were qualified in this way. Although the Chinese and Austrian NOCs were allowed to enter three cyclists, they only entered two. This left three open positions: two were allotted to South Africa and New Zealand, based on their World Tour rankings, and the third was given to Mauritius by direct invitation. Only 66 of the 67 entrants began the race, as María Isabel Moreno of Spain left the country days earlier after failing a drug test.\nPreview.\nJudith Arndt, the German rider who finished second at the 2004 Summer Olympics, was a strong favourite. Arndt had recently finished first at the 2008 Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal, and her form in the months that preceded the race was excellent. Among other contenders were UCI Women's Road standings leader, Marianne Vos of the Netherlands; Briton Nicole Cooke, who said she had greater confidence in her team on this occasion than in 2004, when she finished fifth; and Noemi Cantele of Italy. The Australian team was considered strong: it included Sara Carrigan (the defending champion), Oenone Wood (winner of the 2008 Australian Road Race), and Katherine Bates, all of whom could work on each other's behalf. Because the final leg of the course involved steep ramps, riders considered to be climbing experts (including Cooke, Vos, and Susanne Ljungskog) were favoured.\nAlthough not seen as a strong medal contender, one former champion participating in the race was 49-year-old Jeannie Longo from France, who won the road race in 1996 and had competed in the inaugural event in 1984, making this her seventh appearance.\nMany cyclists expected tropical conditions during the race and adjusted their training to compensate. For example, Marianne Vos prepared in El Salvador. Cyclists had also anticipated a problem with high levels of pollution in Beijing, but these did not appear to affect the results of the men's road race. Although the pollution levels in Beijing on 10 August far exceeded the World Health Organization's safety level, the rain during the women's race decreased the smog level.\nIn the men's race, conducted the previous day, humidity and heat had taken the greatest toll on the athletes. To compensate for the expected warm weather, some female cyclists chose not to wear undershirts. This proved to be a misjudgment, as conditions were cooler in the Great Wall section than on the previous day— compared to . Thunderstorms, bringing persistently heavy rain and strong winds, resulted in actual race conditions far different from expected. Other riders, such as Katherine Bates (who did not finish), prepared by wearing cooling vests before the race and stocked up on ice packs during it.\nCourse.\nThe race was run on the Urban Road Cycling Course (one of Beijing's nine temporary venues), which was in its entirety. Unlike the previous Olympic races, the start and finish were not at the same location. The early section of the race took place within central Beijing; the gradient of this part of the race was relatively flat. After approximately , the riders reached the Badaling section of the Great Wall and began two loops of between the Badaling and Juyong Passes. The gradient increased at this point, as the Badaling Pass gained in elevation from the start of the circuit to the highest point, including ramps as steep as a 10 percent gradient. From there the cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards the Juyong Pass. The final were a moderately steep climb, designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders be grouped together at the end of the race. In total, the distance of the women's race was , less than half the length of the men's race.\nThe race's starting line was at the Yongdingmen Gate, a remnant of Beijing's old city wall, which is a part of the Chongwen District of northern Beijing. The route passed through eight districts: Chongwen, Xuanwu, Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Changping, and Yanqing. Landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven, the Great Hall of the People, Tiananmen Square, the Yonghe Temple, and sections of the Great Wall of China were passed as the course journeyed from urban Beijing into the countryside. It passed the architectural features of the 2008 Olympics, including the Beijing National Stadium and Beijing National Aquatics Center (known colloquially as the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube). The course ended at the Juyong Pass in the Changping District. The course's scenery was described by \"The Guardian\" as \"visually sumptuous\".\nDue to security regulations put in place by the Olympic organisers, spectators were not permitted to stand roadside along the course. Several prominent figures in cycling protested against this decision, including UCI president Pat McQuaid and two Australian riders, Stuart O'Grady and Cadel Evans, who competed in the men's race. McQuaid and O'Grady felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but this plea was ignored.\nRace.\nThe race started at 14:00 China Standard Time (UTC+8), and was scheduled to last until 17:30. The weather was unseasonably cool. It was cloudy and the roads were dry at the start of the race. The clouds brought steady rainfall midway through the race, making conditions challenging.\nThe race saw some incidents which caused riders to lose valuable time. Gu Sun-Geun (South Korea) lost control of her bike, bringing others down with her. She eventually fell into a concrete ditch on the side of the highway. Natalia Boyarskaya (Russia), who had built a lead of 59 seconds over the top of Badaling, had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection.\nThe chase for Boyarskaya was led by Christine Thorburn (United States), who brought the lead down to 34 seconds prior to the final loop of . Emma Pooley (Great Britain) and Tatiana Guderzo (Italy) rode away from the bunch on the climb and caught Boyarskaya with to go, forming a three rider breakaway. The German team, with a steady pace, caught them soon after. Guderzo attacked with about to go over the final summit. She was soon joined by Christiane Soeder (Austria), Emma Johansson (Sweden), Nicole Cooke (Great Britain) and Linda Villumsen (Denmark). With remaining, the group had gained 16 seconds on the main peloton. Marianne Vos (Netherlands), one of the pre-race favourites who was not in the leading group, hesitated before leading the chase together with other pre-race favourite Judith Arndt. Cooke looked out of contention as the five came round the final bend, but she came around the other riders with to go, claiming the gold medal with a clear margin. Johansson came in second and Guderzo won the bronze. Vos eventually led the bunch over the finish line, 21 seconds after the winner.\nIt was later revealed that Cooke had held back intentionally, as she was using lightweight tyres not suited to rainy conditions. The British women's road team manager Julian Winn said \"We were afraid someone might come down in front of her, so we told her to keep to the left. We knew she would chew them up after that.\" Cooke's victory was the result of meticulous planning, as the team had ridden the course before the race and formulated the winning plan.\nDoping incident.\nThe day after the race, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson announced that Spanish rider María Isabel Moreno had become the first athlete of the 2008 Olympics to test positive for a banned substance.\nMoreno had provided a urine sample the day she arrived in Beijing (31 July), but flew back to Madrid on the same day, after suffering a panic attack, and did not return to take part in the race. The urine sample tested positive for erythropoietin (EPO). The IOC stripped Moreno of her Games accreditation, later referring the matter to the UCI which confirmed the positive result. A statement on Moreno's website read that \"she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the [Olympic] village\".\nFinal classification.\nA total of 66 cyclists have been qualified in the event at these Games. Most of them are not expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop, although this situation did not occur.\nThe notation \"s.t.\" indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the cyclist before her, and was therefore credited with the same finishing time."

It was won by Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland.\nPre-race favorites.\nIncluded among the favorites for victory were Cancellara, the reigning world time trial champion, and Germany's Stefan Schumacher, who won both time trials in the 2008 Tour de France, defeating Cancellara in each. Other cyclists considered to be possible medalists included American Dave Zabriskie, and Australians Michael Rogers and Cadel Evans. Evans had originally announced that he was withdrawing from the time trial with a knee injury, giving his place in the event to Rogers, but he recovered faster than expected. The UCI thus gave him a wildcard entry to let him compete. American Levi Leipheimer, Spaniard Alberto Contador, Italy's Marzio Bruseghin and Denis Menchov of Russia were also thought to be contenders for the podium.\nThe event.\nThe men's road time trial took place on a mountainous 47.6 km course consisting of two 23.8 km laps each containing an approximately 305 m climb followed by an equal descent. The 39 riders in the time trial were broken into three groups, who would race the clock one hour separate from one another. Most of the medal favorites were in the last group. Each rider started the course a minute and thirty seconds after the rider who went before them.\nThe leader at the end of the first group of 13 was Svein Tuft (Canada), completing the course in 1h 04' 39\". This was 23 seconds clear of the next closest competitor Robert Gesink (Netherlands). They were still the top two riders after the second group, with American David Zabriskie and Russian Denis Menchov, thought to be podium contenders, both turning in disappointing rides.\nThe medalists all came in the third group. Gustav Larsson of Sweden, starting seventh from the end, beat Tuft by nearly two minutes. The man after Larsson, American Levi Leipheimer, was 36 seconds slower than Larsson, but held on to win bronze. The event's prohibitive favorite, world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara, started last, and though he was six seconds behind Larson's pace at the final time check, he wound up winning the gold medal by a margin of 33 seconds. The other major gold medal favorite, Stefan Schumacher of Germany, finished over three minutes behind Cancellara."

        "text": "Jack Harold Little (December 31, 1931 – November 26, 2016) was an American football player and assistant football coach. After playing college football for Texas A&amp;M, he played two seasons for the Baltimore Colts from 1953–54. He later served as a college assistant coach before working in Texas' parole system and finally retiring.\nEarly years.\nLittle was born in Corpus Christi, Texas. At the age of 12, his father died. His mother remarried when Jack was a senior in high school and moved to Washington, D.C. Jack and his older brother, Gene, remained in Corpus Christi. His brother received a scholarship to play football at Rice University.\nIn high school, Little was a second-team All-District football player.\nPlaying career.\nAlthough Little enrolled at the University of Houston as a freshman, he did not attend any classes or played football there. Intimidated by the three-a-day practices that Houston held, Little and a high school friend escaped to Texas A&amp;M. Little tried out for the football team, only because head coach Harry Stiteler was impressed by his toughness, determination, and intelligence.\nLittle lettered in football at Texas A&amp;M from 1950–52. In 1950, he was part of an A&amp;M squad that led the Southwest Conference (SWC) in total offense, and played in the Presidential Cup. Little made two All-America first-teams during his college years, one as a junior in 1951 and another as a senior in 1952. He also named an All-SWC lineman the same years. He also made the distinguished students list during his senior year for his academic performance. He was ultimately inducted into the Texas A&amp;M Athletic Hall of Fame in 1982.\nIn the 1953 NFL Draft, Little was selected in the 5th round (50th overall) by the Baltimore Colts. He played two seasons for the Colts before a back injury ended his playing career.\nCareer after the NFL.\nAfter his brief stint in the NFL, Little became an assistant football coach for Texas A&amp;I (now Texas A&amp;M–Kingsville). He was subsequently offered another assistant job by Baylor University head coach John Bridgers. Little accepted the position in 1963, and helped lead the Bears to an 8–3–0 record and a No. 20 finish in the national Coaches Poll. Little served as a coaching assistant at Baylor until 1968, when Bridgers was fired. Little remained for a brief period at Baylor, working in the school's outdoor education program.\nLittle later became an assistant for Sam Houston State University. He quit the coaching profession after another back injury. He then worked for Texas' parole system for 17 years before retiring in 1996.\nPersonal life and death.\nLittle married his wife Nancy in 1950, which was at the end of his freshman year. They soon had the first of their two daughters by the time he left Texas A&amp;M. His oldest daughter eventually received a doctorate degree from the school. His nephew, Walker Little, was drafted in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars after playing college football at Stanford.\nJack Little died in Speegleville, Texas on November 26, 2016, at the age of 84."

        "text": "The men's points race at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on August 16 at the Laoshan Velodrome. There were 23 competitors from 23 nations. The event was won by Joan Llaneras of Spain, his second victory in the points race (after 2000) and third consecutive medal in the event (with a silver in 2004). Llaneras was the only person, of any gender, to win multiple medals in the points race, which is no longer on the Olympic programme. His two gold medals made Spain only the second nation to win multiple golds in the men's event; Italy had three (as well as one in the women's event). Silver went to Roger Kluge of Germany. Great Britain earned its first medal in the men's points race with Chris Newton's bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth and final appearance of the event, which would be replaced by the Omnium in 2012 (a multi-component event that concludes with a points race). It was first held in 1900 and not again until 1984; after that, it was held every Summer Games until 2008 when it was removed from the programme. The women's version was held from 1996 through 2008.\n12 of the 23 cyclists from the 2004 Games returned: gold medalist Mikhail Ignatiev of Russia, silver medalist (and 2000 gold medalist) Joan Llaneras of Spain, fourth-place finisher Greg Henderson of New Zealand, fifth-place finisher Milan Kadlec of the Czech Republic, seventh-place finisher Peter Schep of the Netherlands, eighth-place finisher Angelo Ciccone of Italy, ninth-place finisher (and 2000 silver medalist) Milton Wynants of Uruguay, eleventh-place finisher Marco Arriagada of Chile, thirteenth-place finisher (and 1996 and 2000 competitor) Juan Curuchet of Argentina, sixteenth-place finisher (and 2000 competitor) Makoto Iijima of Japan, twentieth-place finisher Wong Kam Po of Hong Kong, and non-finisher Chris Newton of Great Britain. In addition to Llaneras and Wynants, veterans of the 2000 competition were Curuchet, Iijima, and Wong; Curuchet had also competed in 1996.\nLlaneras won the World Championship in 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2007. Newton was the 2002 World Champion. Volodymyr Rybin of Ukraine had won in 2005, Peter Schep of the Netherlands in 2006, and Vasil Kiryienka of Belarus in 2008. Among the medal favorites were Llaneras, Kiryienka, and the defending Olympic champion Ignatiev.\nFor the only time in the eight-appearance history of the event, no nations made their debut in the event. France and Italy both competed for the eighth time, the only nations to have competed in all eight Olympic men's points races.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could qualify 1 cyclist; there were a maximum of 25 quota places, though only 23 were ultimately used in 2008. The reigning World Champion (Kiryienka of Belarus), World Cup leader (Newton of Great Britain), and \"B\" World Champion (Radoslav Konstantinov of Bulgaria) received quota places. Each of the 16 nations that had qualified in the men's Madison competition also received a place (reduced to 15 because Great Britain qualified in the Madison but Newton already qualified). There was also six spots available through UCI rankings to nations that had not yet qualified. \nSwitzerland had a Madison team but did not use its points race place. Konstantinov withdrew and was replaced through an additional UCI ranking place.\nCompetition format.\nThis track cycling event consisted of a single race in which the cyclist with the most points at the end of the race won. This race was a 40 kilometre, 160 lap race. During the race, cyclists could score points in two ways. The first way to score points is to lap the group. Each time a cyclist gained a full lap on the peloton, he scored 20 points. If a cyclist lost a full lap to the peloton, however, he lost 20 points. The other method of scoring points was to place in the intermediate sprints occurring every 10 laps. The first four cyclists in each of the sprints scored points with the first finisher receiving 5 points, the second 3, the third 2, and the fourth 1 point.\nResults.\nFour years earlier, Ignatiev had won by breaking away from the group and finishing a lap ahead of everyone else; this time, he was unable to get away from the peloton. \nLlaneras, the sprint points leader in 2004 who took silver due to the lap behind Ignatiev, was among a group of five that broke away after the sixth sprint to take a one-lap lead. Two sprints later, he, Kluge, and Newton gained a second lap; they would not be caught, essentially assuring the three men the medals. Llaneras won three sprints shortly thereafter, building a large lead over the other two leaders. That lead held to the end, with the Spaniard holding an insurmountable advantage going into the final sprint, which he did not contest. Kluge won the final sprint to move ahead of Newton for the silver medal."

The event was won by Chris Hoy of Great Britain, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint and first medal in the event since 1948. He faced his teammate Jason Kenny in the final, the first time since 1984 that one nation had taken the top two spots. Mickaël Bourgain of France earned bronze. Germany's four-Games (five if East Germany before unification is included) podium streak ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the 24th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Three of the quarterfinalists from 2004 returned: gold medalist Ryan Bayley of Australia, silver medalist Theo Bos of the Netherlands, and eighth-place finisher Mickaël Bourgain of France. Bos (the 2004, 2006, and 2007 world champion) and Chris Hoy of Great Britain (the 2008 world champion and gold medalist in keirin and team sprint earlier in the 2008 Games) were the favorites.\nThe People's Republic of China, Estonia, and Russia each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 24th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could qualify up to 2 cyclists; there were a total of 21 quota places. Each of the 13 nations qualified for the team sprint could enter one cyclist in the individual sprint. Individuals could also earn qualification through the World Championship, the World Cup, and the \"B\" World Championship. The top five cyclists on the UCI ranking also qualified.\nCompetition format.\nThis track cycling event consisted of numerous rounds. The competition began with a flying time trial over 200 metres (the cyclists went around the track 3.5 times, or 875 metres, but only the last 200 metres were timed). All races after the qualifying round consisted of 3 laps of the track (750 metres) but with time recorded only for the final 200 metres. The top 18 cyclists in that qualifying round were seeded into the 1/16 finals. There, they raced one-on-one. The nine winners advanced to the 1/8 finals, while the nine losers were sent to the first repechage. In the repechage, the cyclists were placed in heats of three cyclists apiece; winners moved back into the main competition by advancing into the 1/8 finals.\nThe twelve cyclists in the 1/8 finals again competed one-on-one. The six winners advanced to the quarterfinals, with the six losers getting another chance at the second repechage. This repechage also consisted of three-cyclist heats, with the two winners moving on to the quarterfinals and the rest of the cyclists competing in a 9th to 12th place classification race.\nBeginning with the quarterfinals, the head-to-head competitions switched to a best-of-three format. That format was also used for the semifinals and final. In addition, the bronze medal competition was a best-of-three match between the semifinal losers. The classification race for 5th to 8th places was a single race with all four cyclists competing.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nChris Hoy set a new Olympic record of 9.815 seconds in the qualifying round. The next four fastest men also came in under the old record.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\n200 metre time trial, with the top 18 riders advancing.\nRound 1.\nThe eighteen qualifying cyclists from the preliminary round were paired, 1 vs. 18, 2 vs. 17, and so on, in head-to-head matches, with the winners advancing to the second round and the losers to the first round repechage.\nFirst repechage.\nThe nine losers from the first round were put into three three-man matches, with the winner of each advancing to the next round.\n1/8 finals.\nThe twelve cyclists who qualified this far were paired off again in head-to-head sprint matches.\nSecond repechage.\nThe six cyclists who lost in the second round were matched into two three-man races, with the winner of each advancing to the next round.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe eight cyclists qualified this far were paired for a best two-out-of-three series of 200 metre races. None of the pairings required a third race.\nSemifinals.\nThe four cyclists qualified this far were paired again for a best two-out-of-three series of races.\nFinals.\nThe winners from the semifinals were paired to race for gold and silver, and the losers from that round raced for bronze. Each match was again the best two-out-of-three races.\n9th—12th place classification race.\nDuring the same session as the semifinals, the four cyclists who were eliminated in the second round repechage were put into a single four-man race to determine exact placings from ninth to twelfth.\n5th—8th place classification race.\nIn the same session as the finals, the four cyclists who lost in the quarterfinals were put into one four-man 200 metre race to determine exact placings from fifth to eighth."

They also won the late 2007 World Cup event in Sydney, affording another place based on UCI rankings. This extra place was given to Colombia. No B World Championship was held in this event.\nCompetition format.\nThe men's team pursuit race consists of a 4 km race between two teams of four cyclists, starting on opposite sides of the track. If one team catches the other, the race is over.\nThe tournament consisted of an initial qualifying round. The top four teams in the qualifying round remained in contention for the gold medal, the 5th to 8th place teams could compete for a possible bronze, and the remaining teams were eliminated.\nIn the first round of match competition, teams were seeded into matches based on their times from the qualifying round. The fastest team faced the eighth-fastest, the second-fastest faced the seventh, and so forth. Winners advanced to the finals while losers in each match received a final ranking based on their time in the round. Advancement to the bronze medal final was based solely on time, with the fastest two teams among the six qualifiers who had not advanced to the gold medal final reaching the bronze medal final.\nResults.\nMatch round.\nSemifinals.\nQualification rule: Two fastest teams advance to the gold medal match (Q), while the next two to the bronze medal match (q)."

The pre-event favorite to win the gold medal was the defending Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins of Great Britain, who managed to retain the title, setting a new Olympic record in the preliminary round.\nQualification.\nEighteen cyclists qualified for this event. Bradley Wiggins (Great Britain), the defending Olympic champion, qualified for winning the individual pursuit at the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. Volodymyr Dyudya (Ukraine) qualified at the late 2007 UCI World Cup event in Sydney, winning the individual pursuit there. The qualifier by way of the UCI B World Championship was Alexandr Pliuschin (Moldova). Jenning Huizenga (Netherlands), Taylor Phinney (United States), Phillip Thuaux (Australia), Sergi Escobar Roure (Spain), Alexander Serov (Russia), and David O'Loughlin (Ireland) qualified based on UCI rankings. The rest of the field was formed by berths given to the ten nations that qualified in the team pursuit. This resulted in Great Britain, Australia, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine, and Russia each having two competitors in this event.\nCompetition format.\nThe eighteen cyclists were matched into nine two-man heats. The riders start on opposite sides of the track from one another, held in place by a starting gate until the race begins. While the objective is ostensibly to catch the other rider on the track, victory is most commonly determined by the faster time to cover 4,000 meters. The winners of each individual heat did not matter in the preliminaries - it was instead the overall eight fastest times which would advance to the match round.\nIn the match round, the top eight riders from the preliminaries were matched together, 1 vs. 8, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6, and 4 vs. 5, for the semifinals. In the semifinals, the winner of each match advanced to race for a medal; the two fastest raced for gold and silver, while the two slower winners faced each other for the bronze.\nResults.\nMatch round.\nSemifinals.\nQualification rule: Two fastest cyclists advance to the gold medal match (Q), while the next two to the bronze medal match (q).

This race is a 25 kilometre, 100 lap race. During the race, cyclists can score points in two ways; the cyclist with the most points at the end of the race wins. The first way to score points is to lap the group. Each time a cyclist gained a full lap on the peloton, she scored 20 points. If a cyclist lost a full lap to the peloton, however, she would lose 20 points. The other method of scoring points was to place in the intermediate sprints, held every 10 laps. The first four cyclists in each of those sprints would score, with the first finisher getting 5 points, the second 3, the third 2, and the fourth 1 point."

        "text": "Spain's Rafael Nadal defeated Chile's Fernando González in the final, 6–3, 7–6(7–2), 6–3 to win the gold medal in men's singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics. The win gave him the third of five components of the career Golden Slam, having already won the French Open and Wimbledon. He would go on to win the Australian Open and the US Open to become the second man (after Andre Agassi) to complete the career Golden Slam in singles. Following the event, Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time, ending Roger Federer's record streak of 237 consecutive weeks with the top ranking. González became the first man to win a medal in men's singles across consecutive Olympiads since Charles Winslow in 1920. In the bronze medal match, Serbia's Novak Djokovic defeated the United States' James Blake, 6–3, 7–6(7–4). It was Serbia's first Olympic tennis medal.\nThe tournament was held from August 10 to August 17 at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre in Beijing, China. The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt competition. There were 64 players from 33 nations.\nChile's Nicolás Massú was the reigning gold medalist from 2004. He lost to Argentina's David Nalbandian in the second round.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th (medal) appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nThe number one seed was Roger Federer of Switzerland, making his third Olympic appearance. But number-two seed Rafael Nadal of Spain was favored, with recent wins at the French Open and Wimbledon and closing in on taking the #1 ranking from Federer. Nadal was making his Olympic debut along with Serbian player Novak Djokovic, who joined the rest of the Big Three in the top three seeds. Andy Murray of Great Britain also competed at the Olympics for the first time. Four of the eight quarterfinalists from 2004 returned: gold medalist Nicolás Massú and bronze medalist Fernando González of Chile and quarterfinalists Tomáš Berdych of the Czech Republic and Mikhail Youzhny of Russia.\nThe People's Republic of China, El Salvador, Latvia, Serbia, and Togo each made their debut in the event. France made its 12th appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's singles was primarily through the ATP ranking list of 9 June 2008. Nations had been limited to four players in the event since the 2000 Games. There were 64 quota places available for men's singles. The first 56 were assigned through the world ranking. There were two Tripartite Commission invitation places and 6 final qualification places allocated by the ITF based on continental and national representation along with world rankings.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were in best-of-3 sets, except for the final which was in best-of-5 sets. No tiebreak was played in the final set."

In the bronze medal match, the United States' Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan defeated France's Arnaud Clément and Michaël Llodra, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4. It was Sweden's and the United States' first medals in the event since 1988.\nThe tournament was held from August 10 to August 16 at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre, in Beijing, China. The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt tournament. There were 32 pairs from 24 nations.\nChile's Fernando González and Nicolas Massú were the reigning gold medalists from 2004, but they lost in the first round to Russia's Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of men's doubles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. A demonstration event was held in 1968.\nThe American pair of the Bryan brothers, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan, were the top seed in 2004 but had exited in the quarterfinals. They were again the number one seed in Beijing. The 2004 gold winning pair of Fernando González and Nicolás Massú returned, as did German silver medalists Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schüttler and Indian fourth-place finishers Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes. 2000 gold medalist Daniel Nestor of Canada competed once again with his 2004 partner, Frédéric Niemeyer. Each of the Big Four competed, but expectations of them in the doubles were not particularly high.\nSerbia made its debut in the event. France and Great Britain each made their 10th appearance in the event, tied for most of all nations.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's doubles was primarily through the ATP ranking list of 9 June 2008. Nations had been able to enter two pairs (four players) in the event since the 2004 Games. Each nation was limited to a total of 6 male players in the singles and doubles events combined, so nations with 4 singles players could add only 2 more in doubles. The men's doubles draw was 32 pairs (64 players), with most of the pairs coming from the singles event where nations had 2 or 4 players. There were 10 quota places for direct qualification to the doubles event, based on world ranking. The ITF allocated 12 places based on ranking and continental and national representation (bringing the total number of male tennis players to 86).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were best-of-3 sets, except for the final which was best-of-5 sets. Tiebreakers were not played in the final set."

In the bronze medal match, Russia's Vera Zvonareva defeated China's Li Na 6–0, 7–5. This was the first Olympic medal sweep in tennis since 1908, when three British women won medals in the outdoor women's singles tournament. It was the fifth podium sweep in tennis in Olympic history, all previous sweeps were by British athletes. It was Russia's first victory in the women's singles. Dementieva became the third woman to win multiple Olympic singles medals, following Steffi Graf (1988 and 1992) and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario (1992 and 1996), and the first to do so in non-consecutive Games.\nThe tournament was held from August 10 to August 17 at the National Tennis Center in Beijing, China. The DecoTurf surface made the event a hardcourt tournament. There were 64 competitors from 33 nations.\nJustine Henin was the reigning gold medalist from 2004, but she retired from the sport earlier that year.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nReturning from the 2004 Games were bronze medalist Alicia Molik of Australia and quarterfinalists Francesca Schiavone of Italy, Ai Sugiyama of Japan, and Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia. 2000 gold medalist Venus Williams (who had lost in the third round in 2004) and silver medalist Elena Dementieva (a shocking first-round loss to Molik in 2004) also returned. Venus's sister, Serena Williams, made her Olympic singles debut after withdrawing in 2004 due to injury. Reigning Olympic champion Justine Henin of Belgium had retired earlier in 2008. The #1 seed, Ana Ivanovic of Serbia, withdrew due to an injury. This left a relatively open field, with Ivanovic's countrywoman Jelena Janković, the Williams sisters, and the four Russian players (Kuznetsova, Dementieva, Dinara Safina, and Vera Zvonareva) among the top contenders.\nSerbia made its (post-separation from Montenegro) debut in the event. France made its 10th appearance, most among nations to that point, having missed only the 1908 Games in London (when only British players competed).\nQualification.\nQualification for the women's singles was primarily through the WTA ranking list of 9 June 2008. Nations had been limited to four players in the event since the 2000 Games. There were 64 quota places available for women's singles. The first 56 were assigned through the world ranking.

        "text": "The Australian Schoolboys rugby league team is the national rugby league football team for secondary school students in Australia.\nThe team competes against counterparts in New Zealand, known as the Junior Kiwis, England, Wales and France amongst others. Started in 1972, the Australian Schoolboys have produced over 50 Australian representatives, amongst a host of players who have represented other nations at the highest level.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nEstablished in 1972, the first Australian Schoolboys rugby league team featured players from New South Wales and one Western Australian player. The team did not include any Queensland players as they did not send players to the trials. The team was initially in the Under-16s division, unlike today. Coached by future Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the 20th Century coach, Roy Masters, and featuring future internationals Ian Schubert, Craig Young, Les Boyd, and Royce Ayliffe, the side toured Great Britain, going undefeated on the tour and scoring 108 tries in their 11 games to their opponents' 1. This would be the last Schoolboys team until 1978.\nIn 1978, the first official Australian Schoolboys Championships were held, but NSW Combined Catholic Colleges did not attend. For the first time, Queensland-based high school players trialed, and the first of four 'merit teams' was selected; merit teams do not tour or play games together.\nThe Schoolboys returned to touring with the 1979 team, featuring future Australian internationals Ben Elias and Andrew Farrar. The team toured France and England and went undefeated.\n1980s.\nThe first Schoolboys side of the 80's was selected in 1981, when the Schoolboys hosted the touring [Junior Kiwis] side from New Zealand. They played two games, with the Schoolboys winning both. It was the first time the Schoolboys hosted a tour and played a New Zealand side.\nIn 1982, the Schoolboys toured New Zealand for the first time, where they also received their first ever loss against an Auckland-based selection team, 16–10. The team was captained by future Australian international Paul Langmack and featured another future international in Andrew Ettingshausen. Another merit team was selected in 1983 and once again featured Ettingshausen. Future internationals Greg Alexander and Paul Sironen, and future first grade regulars, Tony Butterfield and Jeff Hardy, were also a part of the side.\nIn 1984, the Schoolboys hosted a tour by the British Upper Schools and Colleges (BUSCARLA), winning both matches. The 1984 Australian Schoolboys was also the first to feature a player who would go on to represent a country other than Australia at international level. Theo Anast from Armidale High School would later play six games for France between 1993 and 1994.\nThe team selected in 1985 went undefeated against a touring Junior Kiwis side and in 1986 went undefeated once again on their tour of England. The 1986 side featured future Australian internationals Bradley Clyde and Andrew Gee. In 1987, another merit side was selected, which featured Clyde for the second time.\nIn 1988, the side toured New Zealand and featured Tim Brasher, David Fairleigh and a 16-year-old Brad Fittler. The team went undefeated. Fittler was named again in 1989, as the Schoolboys hosted the British Amateur Rugby League under 19's (BARLA) for two games, winning both.\n1990s.\nThe 1990 Schoolboys side was originally a merit team, but played a one-off game against the Australian Youth Development Squad, which they won 38–6. The 1991 team, once again, went undefeated on their tour of England.\nIn 1992, with a side featuring future premiership winner and Australian international Steve Menzies, the side toured New Zealand. On the tour, the Schoolboys lost their first ever Test match to a New Zealand side featuring future Kiwis Gene Ngamu, Joe Vagana and Ruben Wiki.\nThe 1993 Australian Schoolboys hosted BARLA and played two tests, winning both. Future NSW State of Origin player and world champion boxer Anthony Mundine was in the team.\nIn 1994, the Schoolboys hosted, and defeated, the touring Junior Kiwis. This marked the first appearance of a then-15-year-old Owen Craigie, who would represent the Schoolboys a record three times in 1994, 1995, and 1996. Future Australian internationals Brett Kimmorley, Ben Ikin and Luke Priddis were also in the side.\nThe 1995 Schoolboys toured France and England and went undefeated. The side featured future Australian internationals Trent Barrett and Matthew Gidley and World Cup winning New Zealand captain Nathan Cayless. 1995 also saw the first ever Northern Territory schoolboy in Duncan MacGillivray. MacGillivary would later represent Scotland at the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.\nDue to the ARL and Super League war in 1996, the Schoolboys (who were supposed to tour New Zealand) toured Papua New Guinea for the first time. They went undefeated in their four matches. The team was coached by 1972 Australian Schoolboys representative Brian Hetherington. The team also featured Ben Rauter, whose father Herb also represented the Australian Schoolboys in 1972. Ben and Herb became the first father son pair to represent the Schoolboys.\nThe side went undefeated in their 1997 when they once again hosted BARLA, in a squad which featured future first graders and representative players Luke Bailey, Dane Carlaw and Luke Patten. In 1998, the Schoolboys toured New Zealand, playing 4 games and losing only one to an Auckland Invitational XIII. The team featured future Australian international Mark Gasnier, who would play for the Schoolboys again the following year. The 1999 side toured France, England and Ireland, going undefeated. The squad featured future Australian internationals Justin Hodges, Jamie Lyon, Corey Parker and Brent Tate.\n2000s.\nThe first Schoolboys team of the new millennium hosted a touring New Zealand schools side in 2000, comfortably winning both games. In 2001, the Schoolboys hosted the touring England Academy side and French Schools team. The Schoolboys went undefeated in three games and featured future internationals Greg Bird and Michael Weyman (who would represent again in 2002).\nIn 2002, on the Schoolboys tour of England and France, they lost two games for the first time on the same tour and lost a test series, when they were beaten by the England Academy side. The Schoolboys side featured a number of future Australian internationals including Weyman, Keith Galloway, Ben Hannant, Ryan Hoffman Tom Learoyd-Lahrs, future Fijian international Ashton Sims and future French international Dimitri Pelo.\nThe 2003 side, which featured current New Zealand captain Benji Marshall and future Australian international Karmichael Hunt, toured New Zealand winning two games and losing one. In 2004, the Schoolboys hosted the touring English and French teams. They defeated BARLA and a France Schools side but lost to the England Academy team. The 2004 side featured future international Greg Inglis.\nThe 2005 side played a two games test series against the Junior Kiwis in Australia, winning the first game and losing the second. The team featured future Australian international stars Michael Jennings, David Taylor, Darius Boyd and Akuila Uate. In 2006, the Schoolboys toured Wales, England and France and went undefeated for the first time since 2001. Future representative players Israel Folau, Mitchell Pearce and Chris Lawrence were on the tour.\nThe Schoolboys then went undefeated on their 2007 tour of New Zealand, in 2008 against the touring England Academy and French Schools sides and in 2009 against the touring Great Britain Community Lions. Over the three years the side featured future first grade players Martin Kennedy, Kieran Foran, Lachlan Coote, Andrew McCullough, William Hopoate, Jamal Idris, Aaron Woods, Jason Taumalolo, Cheyse Blair and Joseph Leilua, amongst a host of others.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, the side toured England, Wales and France, winning 4 games and losing two (both to the England Academy).

        "text": "Tom Kirk (1916–1994) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s and 1940s. A New South Wales state representative goal-kicking fullback, he played in Sydney's NSWRFL for the Canterbury-Bankstown and Newtown clubs (with whom he won premierships) as well as with North Sydney. He was the first player to become the season's top point scorer on 5 occasions: 1938, 1940, 1943, 1944, 1946. In 1947 he became the first player to score 1,000 career points in the NSWRFL.\nPlaying career.\nFormer fullback of Tumut's Maher Cup team, Kirk moved to Sydney and first tasted premiership success with Canterbury's 1938 Grand Final-winning team, landing four goals in the 19–6 win over Easts in the final. That year he also topped the competition's point-scorers list and the following year made his debut for NSW in the centres.\nJoining Newtown, Kirk became the first player to kick 100 goals in a season in 1943, including five in the 34–7 win over Norths in the premiership decider. He was the season's leading point scorer on five occasions, the last in 1946.\nHe twice kicked a club record 11 goals during the 1944 NSWRFL season and set Newtown's club record for most points in a match with 25 (1 try and 11 goals) against St George, on 26 August 1944.\nIn 1946 he overtook Arthur Oxford's record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL career (864); Kirks's eventual total of 1,042 stood as the new career record for thirteen seasons until it was bettered by Bernie Purcell in 1959.\nIn 1947, Kirk joined North Sydney for his last season in Sydney, and made a return to the New South Wales side in his final year in the Sydney competition.\nHe finished his playing career at Barmedman, New South Wales in 1953.\nKirk died in March 1994 aged 77."

        "title": "1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft",
        "text": "The 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft was conducted to stock up the rosters of four expansion teams in Major League Baseball created via the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion and which would begin play in the 1969 season.\nThe expansion draft for the Montreal Expos and the San Diego Padres was held on October 14, 1968. The expansion draft for the Kansas City Royals and the Seattle Pilots was held on October 15, 1968.\nBackground.\nMontreal Expos.\nOn December 2, 1967, Gerry Snyder presented a bid for a Montreal franchise to Major League Baseball's team owners at their winter meetings in Mexico City. One potential wild card in Montreal's favor was that the chair of the National League's expansion committee was influential Los Angeles Dodgers president Walter O'Malley, under whom the minor league Montreal Royals had become affiliated with the Dodgers. On May 27, 1968, O'Malley announced that franchises were being awarded to Montreal and San Diego, beginning play the following year (1969).\nBusiness executive Charles Bronfman of the Seagram's distilling empire owned the new team. With a long history of use in Montreal, the \"Royals\" was one of the candidate nicknames for the new franchise, but the American League's new Kansas City team adopted this name, so the new owners conducted a contest to name the team. Many names were suggested by Montrealers (including the \"Voyageurs\" and in a coincidental twist, the \"Nationals\" — now used by the team in its new home in Washington, D.C.) but there was a clear winner. At the time, the city was still basking in the glow of the recently completed Expo 67, the most popular World's Fair to date, and so the name \"Expos\" was used. The Expos name also had the advantage of being the same in both English and French, the city's two dominant languages.\nSan Diego Padres.\nThe Padres adopted their name from the Pacific Coast League team which arrived in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by then-18-year-old San Diego native Ted Williams. Their original owner was C. Arnholt Smith, a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the PCL Padres whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. The team was led by longtime baseball executive Buzzie Bavasi.\nKansas City Royals.\nThe \"Royals\" name originates from the American Royal Livestock Show, held in Kansas City since 1899. Entering Major League Baseball as an expansion franchise in 1969, the club was founded by Ewing Kauffman, a Kansas City businessman. The franchise was established following the actions of Stuart Symington, then-United States Senator from Missouri, who demanded a new franchise for the city after the Athletics—Kansas City's previous major league team—moved to Oakland, California.\nSeattle Pilots.\nSeattle initially had much going for it when it joined the American League in 1969. Seattle had long been a hotbed for minor league baseball and was home to the Seattle Rainiers, one of the pillars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Cleveland Indians had almost moved to Seattle in . Many of the same things that attracted the Indians made Seattle a plum choice for an expansion team. Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast (behind Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area).\nNotes.\nThe Expos acquired Bobby Wine as compensation after Larry Jackson decided to retire rather than report to Montreal.\nDave Giusti never played for the Padres. He was traded back to the Cardinals two months later for four players.\nHoyt Wilhelm never played for the Royals. He was traded to the California Angels on December 12, 1968, for two players.\nLou Piniella never played for the Pilots. He was traded to the Royals on April 1, 1969.\nJesus Alou, Jack Billingham and Skip Guinn never played for the Expos. Alou and Donn Clendenon were traded to Houston for Rusty Staub. When Clendenon threatened to retire rather than report, Billingham and Guinn were sent to Houston to complete the trade.\nKatawczik, Glass, Miklos, Richmond and Click never played in the Majors.\nIke Brookens never played for the Royals. He did not play in the Majors until making his debut with the Detroit Tigers in 1975.\nJimy Williams never played for the Expos or returned to the Majors.\nRick James never played for the Padres or returned to the Majors."

        "title": "Archery Olympic Round",
        "text": "The Olympic Round was introduced to target archery so that it could become more watchable as a competitive sport, the main focus of this being for the Olympics when shown on television. The round was developed by the World Archery Federation (WA; formerly FITA). It is used at the Olympic Games, the Archery World Cup and in many lower profile or local tournaments.\nIndividual event.\nA qualifying round is shot to order the competitors and give them a seeding. The qualifying round is usually a WA 70m round, consisting of 72 arrows shot at a distance of 70 meters. These seedings are then sorted into head-to-head matches. \nEach match consists of 4 ends of 3 arrows, giving a 12-arrow match shot at a distance of 70 meters on a 122 cm target face. In early stages of the elimination rounds this may be changed to 2 ends of 6 arrows in order to save time. In later stages and at the Olympics and World Cup the shooting order alternates with each archer shooting one arrow at a time, having 40 seconds to shoot each arrow. The highest placed athlete in the qualification round will decide the order of shooting of the first end. The athlete with the lowest cumulative score will shoot first at the next end. If the athletes are tied, the athlete that shot first in the first end shoots first in the next end. The archer with the highest score at the end of the 12 arrows is declared the winner.\nIn the event of a tie each archer shoots a single arrow; the archer with the highest scoring arrow wins. If there is still a tie a second single arrow is shot, and, if required, a third. On the third arrow if there is still a tie the archer with the arrow closest to the center is the winner. If an archer shoots after their time of 40 seconds or at the wrong time they will lose their highest scoring arrow.\nTeam event.\nTeams are made up of three archers from the same discipline (male or female, recurve or compound bows). The teams shoot a qualifying round and are seeded on the combined score of the team. \nA team match consists of 4 ends of each archer shooting 2 arrows, making 24 arrows in total. The team has 2 minutes to shoot all 6 arrows. All archers start in a box 1 meter from the shooting line. Once the time has started one archer may leave the box and shoot. Only one archer may be out of the box at a time.\nIn the event of a tie, each team member will shoot one arrow each. The team will have 1 minute to shoot the 3 arrows. The team with the highest total score is the winner. If still tied another 3 arrow are shot, and a third extra end if required. If still tied in the third extra end the team with an arrow closest to the center of the target wins; if these are the same distance from the center the team with the second arrow closest arrow is the winner, and the third if need be.\nIn addition to the fouls above there are additional fouls for the team round. If an archer leaves the box before the previous archer has entered the box a 'foot fault' is called and the archer must re-enter the box before leaving again. The archer must not remove an arrow from their quiver until they are on the shooting line, otherwise they must re-enter the box and return the arrow to their quiver before leaving again. For both of these fouls the judge will display a yellow card. If the archer does not obey the judge they will receive a red card and lose their highest scoring arrow.\nSets.\nSince April 2010 the sets system has been used instead of the 12-arrow match. Elimination rounds are up of up to 3 sets of 6 arrows, and the finals are made up of up to 5 sets of 3 arrows. If a competitor wins a set they receive two points; if the set is drawn the competitors receive one point each. If a competitor has not won a majority of the sets (2 in a 3 set match and 3 in a 5 set match) the outcome is decided by a single arrow shoot-off with the competitor closest to the middle being declared the winner."

        "title": "Vuelta a España records and statistics",
        "text": "The Vuelta a España is an important cycling race (one of the Grand Tours). The first Vuelta a España was in 1935. As the Vuelta a España is a stage race, a classification based on times is calculated after every stage. The cyclist with the lowest time after a stage is the leader of the general classification after that stage. A jersey is given to that cyclist, which the cyclist wears during the next stage. From 1999 to 2009, this jersey had a golden color and was named the golden jersey. From 2010 onwards, the leader's jersey was red. It has also been black and white at different points in the Vuelta's history.\nAlthough the leader of the classification after a stage gets the leader's jersey, he is not considered the winner of that jersey, only the wearer. Only after the final stage, the wearer of the leader's jersey is considered the winner, and therefore the winner of the Vuelta a España.\nSince the first Vuelta a España in 1935, there have been 1,491 stages, up to and including the Stage 12 of the 2021 Vuelta a España The race leader following each stage has been awarded a leader's jersey.\nAlthough the number of stages is 1,491, there have been 1,492 leader's jerseys awarded, because after the first stage of the 1948 Vuelta a España, Bernardo Ruiz and Julián Berrendero shared the lead and both received the leader's jersey. As of 2021, 1,492 leader's jerseys have been awarded in the Vuelta a España to 226 different riders.\nJerseys per rider.\nKey:\nIn previous Vueltas a España, sometimes a stage was split in two. On such occasions, only the cyclist leading at the end of the day is counted. The \"Leader's jerseys\" column gives the number of days that the cyclist \"wore\" the leader's jersey, the \"Vuelta wins\" column gives the number of times that the cyclist \"won\" the Vuelta. The next three columns indicate the number of times the rider won the points classification, the mountains classification, and the years in which the rider lead the general classification, with bold years indicating an overall Vuelta win.\nFor example: Alex Zülle has spent 48 days in the leader's jersey, and won the overall classification two times. He wore the leader's jersey in the Vueltas of 1993, 1996, 1997 and 2000, of which he won the 1996 and 1997 Vueltas.\nJerseys per country.\nThe leader's jersey has been awarded to 23 different countries since 1935. In the table below, \"Jerseys\" indicates the number of leader's jerseys that were given to cyclists of each country. \"Vuelta wins\" stands for the number of Vuelta wins by cyclists of that country, \"Points\" for the number of times the points classification was won by a cyclist of that country and \"KoM\" for the number of times the mountains classification was won by a cyclist of that country. \"Combo'\" shows the winners of the combination classification, This classification is calculated by adding the numeral ranks of each cyclist in the general, points, and mountains classifications (a rider must have a score in all). \nThe \"Most recent\" column shows the cyclist of the country that wore the leader's jersey most recently. The \"Different holders\" column gives the number of different cyclists of the country that wore the leader's jersey.\nStage wins per country.\nRiders from 33 countries have won at least one stage in the Vuelta. Tables are correct as of \"26 August 2021\""

        "title": "Kevin Ward (baseball)",
        "text": "Kevin Michael Ward (September 28, 1961 – March 9, 2019) was an American professional baseball outfielder for the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB).\nWard was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the sixth round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft. He spent time the Oakland Athletics organization before making his major league debut with the San Diego Padres in 1991. Over two seasons with the team, Ward played in a total of 125 games, and hit for a .217 average, with five career home runs alongside twenty runs batted in.\nAmateur career.\nBorn in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, on September 28, 1961, Ward was the youngest of four children to parents Robert and Paula. He was raised in Chalfont and attended Central Bucks High School West in Doylestown, where he was an American football quarterback and baseball pitcher. Ward excelled as a starting quarterback for CB West. Running an option play, Ward ran for 98 yards against Coatsville during a game in the 1977 season. Ward finished his high school career with a 21-1 record as quarterback, going 11-0 during his senior year and was a third team all-state selection at quarterback. Future NFL star Dan Marino was the first team selection. His standout career led to his recruitment at Arizona where he was a two-sport star for the Wildcats.\nWard played football and baseball at the University of Arizona from 1979 to 1983. Ward's first year of college football was played under coach Tony Mason. In his sophomore season, Ward started three games at quarterback for coach Larry Smith before Smith moved Ward to receiver. Ward played collegiate baseball under coach Jerry Kindall between 1981 and 1983. In 1982, Ward hit for a .403 batting average, 46 runs batted in, and fourteen stolen bases. All three were team-leading totals, and Ward was named to the All-Pac-10 South team. After the 1981 and 1982 seasons, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nProfessional career.\nWard made his professional debut with the Bend Phillies of the Northwest League in 1981. Ward led the team with a .307 batting average, as well as lead the team in hit by pitch with four. The following season was spent in a higher class of A ball, as ward played for the Peninsula Pilots of the Carolina League. While Ward's batting average dipped against a higher level of competition, he did find his power, belting 13 home runs, second on the team to Randy Day. The following season, Ward again moved up the chain, playing double A ball for the Reading Phillies. Appearing in 43 games that season, ward belted 21 home runs and hit over three hundred again, finishing the season with a .303 batting average. He played the following season at Reading as well. His manager that season at Reading was George Culver,a journeyman ex major league pitcher who the previous season had been Ward's teammate. Playing time increased as war played in 119 games that season, but his home run and batting averages dipped. However, the Phillies thought highly enough of Ward that they promoted him to the Maine Guides, their Triple A club in 1988. Ward was part of an outfield that also included two other Phillies prospects, Ron Jones and Jim Orlander. While Ward was steady in the field, he hit 11 home runs and batted .230.\nAt the end of the 1988 season, Ward became a free agent and signed a contract with the Oakland A's, for whom he played two minor league seasons in their farm system, starting at double A- hunstville and finally Triple A Tacoma. He was granted free agency at the end of the 1990 and signed with the San Diego Padres before spring training in 1991. After a long struggle in the minor leagues, Ward finally made his major league debut on May 10, 1991. Ward batted sixth in the line up, right after power hitting Fred McGriff, who batted fifth. In the bottom of the second, facing Expos pitcher Brian Barnes, ward got a hit in his first at bat, a double that drove in McGriff. Ward faced Barry Jones in the seventh when Jones was called for a balk. The bases were loaded, so the balk forced Bip Roberts home and advanced the runners. However, Montreal held on for the 6-4 win. On August 26, 1991, the San Diego Padres were playing the Pittsburgh Pirates. San Diego led off the second inning, and Ward was facing Pirates pitcher Randy Tomlin. Facing a 3-2 count, Ward hit a deep fly to center field that turned into Ward's first home run in the major leagues. Ward's homer made it 2-1 Padres, and they went on to win 7-5. Ward would hit his second homer of the season the very next game, off Pirates pitcher Zane Smith in the seventh inning. The Pirates ended up winning the game 5-2. The home runs against the Pirates were Ward's only long balls of the season. Another highlight of the 1991 season was a series the Padres played in Philadelphia. Not only was it special because it was Philadelphia that he'd been drafted by to start his pro career, but it was also the first time that his parents got to see him play professional baseball.\nWard turned 30 in 1992, and spent the season as a reserve outfielder for San Diego. 1992 was Ward's second and final season in the majors. In 1993, he signed with the expansion Colorado Rockies and played for their Triple A team, the Colorado City Sky Sox. Ward retired from baseball after that season.\nDeath.\nWard was diagnosed with brain cancer in December 2018, and died of the disease on March 9, 2019, aged 57. He was married to Christy, with whom he had two children."

        "text": "A cricket tournament at the Pacific Games, previously the South Pacific Games, was introduced in 1979 and was played intermittently at games in the 1980s and 1990s, depending on the facilities of the host nation. It was played continuously from 2003 to 2019, but was not included for the 2023 Pacific Games in Solomon Islands. Detailed records of the tournaments prior to 2003 have not been kept and little is known with certainty of the first three tournaments, beyond knowing what teams won the gold and silver medals at each Games.\nResults.\n1979.\nVenue: Suva, Fiji\nSeven teams contested the first cricket tournament at the South Pacific Games.\nPNG beat Tuvalu by 195 runs in their opening game, scoring 220/9 from 60 overs before bowling Tuvalu out for just 25 runs. Vavine Pala took 5/10. The game between Fiji and New Hebrides was unable to proceed due to a wet outfield. PNG later suffered a shock loss to Tonga before defeating Fiji in the semi-final by 20 runs. In the other semi-final New Hebrides defeated Tonga. PNG ultimately won the final by nine wickets after bowling the New Hebrides out for 53 runs, with 20-year-old fast bowler Mike Steven taking 8/27.\n1987.\nVenue: Nouméa, New Caledonia\n1991.\nVenue: Port Moresby/Lae, Papua New Guinea\n2003.\nVenue: Suva, Fiji\n2007.\nVenue: Apia, Samoa\nRound robin tournament of limited overs cricket (maximum 50 overs per side).\n2011.\nVenue: Noumea, New Caledonia\nIn 2011 the format was switched to the shorter Twenty20 game instead of the previous 50 over cricket. A round-robin stage was played before the two top teams met in the final.\n2015.\nVenue: Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea\nIn 2015, a women's tournament was held for the first time alongside the men's tournament. The 20-over format was retained.\n2019.\nVenue: Apia, Samoa\nTonga included both men's and women's cricket in its successful bid for the 2019 Pacific Games, to be held in Nukuʻalofa. However, Tonga withdrew from hosting in May 2017 and was replaced by Samoa.\nPacific Mini Games.\nFor the first time, Vanuatu included a men's cricket tournament in its successful bid for the 2017 Pacific Mini Games, to be held in Port Vila. The cricket facilities near Korman Stadium are planned to be renovated before the tournament. However, the effects of Cyclone Pam in 2015 have, according to some sources, cast doubt upon the country's ability to host the games.\nRecords.\nAs detailed results have not been kept for the first three tournaments, it is not possible to present detailed records. What is known is that Papua New Guinea's total of 572/7 against New Caledonia is the highest team total in any international one-day match, along with the winning margin of 510 runs, and therefore also in the South Pacific Games.\nNotes.\n The number of teams at the tournaments has varied – there were seven teams in 1979, then four in 1987 and five in 1991. When the sport resumed at the 2003 games, six teams contested, but this number dropped to five in 2007 and four in 2011 and 2015 (for the men's tournament – the women's tournament had six teams).\n Samoa and Vanuatu competed as Western Samoa and the New Hebrides, respectively, at the 1979 games.\n 1979: Pacific Islands Monthly reported Papua New Guinea defeating New Hebrides in the final to win gold, passing the required total of 53 with the loss of only one wicket. Fiji defeated Tonga in a much closer third place play-off to win bronze by two wickets, passing the formidable total set by Tonga of 183 for the loss of six wickets.\n 1979: Roy Morgan's Encyclopedia of World Cricket indicates that Western Samoa finished fifth at the 1979 South Pacific Games. They played New Caledonia in the fifth place play-off so New Caledonia are assumed to have finished sixth. Tuvalu finished seventh.\n 1987: Roy Morgan's Encyclopedia of World Cricket indicates that Papua New Guinea defeated Fiji in the final to decide the gold and silver medals. The other three teams taking part were New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The same book indicates that New Caledonia have never won an international match, so they are assumed to have finished fifth with either the Solomon Islands or Vanuatu winning the bronze or finishing fourth. \n 1991: Results presented here are based on sparse records. The official results from the SPG website list PNG, Fiji and Tonga as the gold, silver and bronze medalists, respectively. Roy Morgan's Encyclopedia of World Cricket indicates that Papua New Guinea defeated Fiji in the final to decide the gold and silver medals. However it did not mention Tonga, and noted only two other teams in the tournament, New Caledonia and Vanuatu. The same book indicates that New Caledonia have never won an international match, which might lend weight to the assumption that Vanuatu won the bronze medal. For this article, however, the official results are preferred."

He played for a team known as the Erie Jarecki Manufacturing nine in 1884 and in 1885, he played with a team known as the Erie Olympics.\nMorrison was purchased from the New York Metropolitans for $500 in January, 1887, and he played in his first big league game on April 19, 1887. That season he went 12-25 with a 4.92 ERA in 316 innings. In 40 games started, he had 35 complete games, 205 walks and 158 strikeouts. He led the league in home runs allowed (13) and walks allowed, he finished second in strikeouts per nine innings (4.49), fourth in hit batsmen (22), sixth in strikeouts and losses, and eighth in earned runs allowed. His 22 hit batsmen are tied for ninth most all time among rookie pitchers.\nHe appeared in only four games in 1888, going 1-3 with a 5.40 ERA.\nIn 1890, Morrison split time with two teams, the Stars and Orioles. He went 7-11 with a 5.53 ERA that season, making 21 appearances (18 starts) and completing 16 games. His 21 wild pitches were seventh in the league and his three games finished were ninth. His 4.82 strikeouts per nine innings were also ninth in the league.\nHe played his final big league game on September 21, 1890.\nOverall, Morrison went 20-39 with a 5.14 ERA in 65 career games (62 starts). He had 55 complete games, 325 walks and 254 strikeouts in 504 innings. As a hitter, he hit .213 in 287 career at-bats.\nFollowing his death, Morrison was buried in Trinity Cemetery in Erie."

        "text": "The Azerbaijan men's national basketball team () is the national basketball team of Azerbaijan. The team is controlled by the Azerbaijan Basketball Federation.\nSince becoming members of FIBA in 1994, Azerbaijan has mostly taken part in smaller competitions such as the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries, winning it twice, in 2006 and 2008. The national team also won a title at the Islamic Solidarity Games in their lone appearance in 2005.\nHistory.\nAfter Azerbaijan obtained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Azerbaijan Basketball Federation was founded in 1993, and became members of FIBA in 1994. During Azerbaijan's early years, the national team did not appear in any international competition until they entered EuroBasket 2003 qualifiers.\nFollowing Azerbaijan's failed qualification process for EuroBasket 2003, the national team entered their first international tournament at the 2004 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries. Azerbaijan would complete the event at a (2–2) record, for a fourth place finish. A year later, the national team entered the 2005 Islamic Solidarity Games, where Azerbaijan finished the competition winning the gold medal.\nIn 2006, Azerbaijan participated in the 2006 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries, in which the team went (4–1), and reached the final to defeat Albania 66–57 to win the title. At the event in 2008, Azerbaijan repeated as champions, this time in an 78–80 victory over Moldova. After the tournament, Azerbaijan did not appear at an international event until EuroBasket 2013 qualifiers. However, Azerbaijan would eventually be eliminated from qualifying following a (4–4) record.\nTen years after Azerbaijan competed in their last international competition, the national team made its return at the 2022 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries. Azerbaijan went on to close out the tournament in fourth place.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2027 FIBA World Cup Pre-Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Switzerland and Kosovo.\nPast rosters.\n2022 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries: finished 4th among 6 teams"

        "text": "Jaime Omar García Rodríguez (born July 8, 1986) is a Mexican former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays and Chicago Cubs.\nThe Cardinals drafted García in the 22nd round of the 2005 MLB Draft from Sharyland High School in Mission, Texas, and he made his MLB debut with the Cardinals in 2008. In 2010, he was third in the National League Rookie of the Year balloting while posting the fourth-best earned run average in the league. A member of the 2011 World Series championship Cardinals, García struggled with injuries between 2013 and 2014.\nAfter eight seasons in St. Louis, García was traded three times within a year, first to the Braves following the 2016 season, then to the Twins in the 2017 season, and to the Yankees less than a week later.\nEarly life.\nJaime García was born on July 8, 1986, in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, as the second of three children to civil engineer Jaime García Sr. and Gloria Rodríguez Flores. He was raised between the border of Reynosa, and McAllen, Texas. He attended Sharyland High School in Mission, Texas.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Baltimore Orioles originally drafted García in the 30th round of the 2004 MLB Draft. Due to a poorly translated test, the Orioles chose not to sign García. By the time a new scouting director changed the team's position, García opted to re-enter the draft.\nAfterward, the St. Louis Cardinals drafted García in the 22nd round of the 2005 MLB Draft. Joe Almaraz, the Orioles scout who wanted to sign García the year before, had moved on to the Cardinals organization, and was influential in the Cardinals selection of García.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nEarly career (2008–2011).\nGarcía made his major league debut in relief on July 11, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He pitched two innings, giving up one hit, walking one, and striking out two.\nGarcía underwent Tommy John surgery after the 2008 season and began the 2009 season on the 60-day disabled list. Later in the 2009 season, García returned to the Cardinals organization and was optioned to the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. On September 9, 2009, García retired the first 13 batters he faced in the Redbirds' first playoff game against the Albuquerque Isotopes.\nThe 2010 MLB season was García's first full season in the majors. He was chosen as the number five starter over fellow lefty Rich Hill, who started the season with the Memphis Redbirds in AAA, and Kyle McClellan, who returned to the bullpen for the Cardinals. He finished the season in third place in the voting for NL Rookie of the Year with a record of 13–8, and an ERA of 2.70 (4th in the NL). García was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team and a pitcher on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.\nGarcía began the 2011 season as the number-three starter. In his first start of the season, April 3 against the San Diego Padres, he threw his first MLB complete game shutout while striking out nine and giving up four hits in 102 pitches. For this performance, he was named a co-winner of the National League Player of the Week Award. On May 6, he took a perfect game into the eighth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers, before issuing a one-out walk to Casey McGehee, followed by a hit to Yuniesky Betancourt. The near-perfect game ended as a two hit complete-game shutout. On July 13, the Cardinals announced they had signed García to a four-year contract extension that guaranteed him $27.5 million. The contract included club options for the following two seasons. With the club option, García had the opportunity to earn $50 million, which could keep him with the team for six years until 2017. To that point in the season, he was 9–3 with a 3.23 ERA.\nOn August 2, García hit his first career home run, a three-run homer off Brewers' starter Shaun Marcum. For the 2011 season, García went 13–7, was second in the NL in complete games (two), shutouts (two), and wild pitches (12), and his .650 win–loss percentage was ninth best in the National League.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals advanced to play the Texas Rangers in the World Series after defeating the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers in the playoffs. When García started Game 2, he became the second Mexican-born pitcher since Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 to ever start a World Series game. García pitched 10 innings, including seven scoreless innings, and posted a 1.80 ERA with 10 strikeouts in the series. On October 28, the Cardinals defeated the Rangers 4–3 in the best-of-seven series after being down 3–2 to claim the franchise's 11th World Series title.\n2012–2014.\nGarcía went 7–7 with a 3.92 ERA in 20 starts in the 2012 season before being shut down for the year due to shoulder discomfort. The Cardinals would go on to be one win away from going to the 2012 World Series before losing to the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS.\nIn 2013, García went 5–2 with a 3.58 ERA before being injured and ultimately undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery, with his last start on May 17.\nGarcía was initially thought to be able to play at the start of the 2014 season, but developed shoulder bursitis and was unable to pitch in the major leagues for 366 days until activated, with his first start on May 18, 2014. In his fifth start of the season on June 8, García held the Toronto Blue Jays to seven scoreless innings to earn the win in a 5–0 victory. In the first inning of the game, he issued his first walks of the season, which he had avoided in his first IP. However, he informed the Cardinals on July 5 that he would have surgery on his left shoulder to correct thoracic outlet syndrome, ending his second consecutive season with fewer than ten starts.\n2015–2016.\nIn May 2015, García returned to pitch for the Cardinals. He lost his first start to the New York Mets, 5–0, despite allowing just two runs in seven innings. He gained his first win in nearly a year on May 26 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, in which he completed six innings in a 6–4 victory. His next start, on June 1, was against the Brewers. In seven innings, he allowed one run and struck out four, with less than 90 pitches, but ended up with a 1–0 loss, bringing his record to 1–2 with a 2.70 ERA in his first three games.\nIn a June 12 start against the Kansas City Royals, Jaime García netted his 500th career strikeout by getting Omar Infante as the Cardinals won 4–0. It was García's 102nd career start; he had also not issued a walk in his first 30 IP of the season. The Cardinals placed García with a right groin strain on July 5. He had sustained the injury on June 24 while running the bases against the Miami Marlins. While carrying out his minor league rehabilitation assignment with the Peoria Chiefs on July 23, he pitched in a combined no-hitter and 2–0 win against the Clinton LumberKings, a Seattle Mariners affiliate. The starter for the game, García pitched the first five innings and struck out six.\nWhile completing innings against the Miami Marlins on August 14 in a 3–1 win, one of the hits García allowed was to Ichiro Suzuki, for his 4,191st hit in professional baseball, matching Ty Cobb. García achieved his 50th career win in a 4–1 decision over the Pirates on September 5, also reaching 100 IP in a season for the first time since 2012. Totaling 20 regular season starts, he finished the season with 10–6 won–loss record, 2.43 ERA, and 1.046 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP). The Cardinals won 10 of his 11 starts in August and September; and, at Busch Stadium, he turned in nine quality starts in 10 attempts, allowing a 1.70 ERA and 0.888 WHIP. The Cardinals won 100 games and the National League Central division title. He started Game 2 of the NLDS against the Cubs, but lasted just two innings as the Cardinals lost this game 6–3 before the Cubs eliminated the Cardinals. On October 31, 2015, the Cardinals announced they exercised García's team option for 2016 worth $11.5 million.\nIn his second appearance of 2016, García turned in a career start against Milwaukee at Busch Stadium on April 14. He pitched a complete game one-hit shutout while striking out a career-high 13 batters and inducing 13 ground outs as St. Louis won, 7–0. He became the first left-handed pitcher in franchise history to achieve a one-hit shutout while striking out at least 13. He also collected two hits while batting. The 13 strikeouts were the most by a Cardinal lefty since Steve Carlton struck out 16 in 1970, with García posting a game score of 97, a season-high for MLB through that date. He struck out 11 in eight innings on August 5, defeating the Atlanta Braves 1–0, and driving in the only run of the game.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn December 1, 2016, the St. Louis Cardinals traded García to the Atlanta Braves for Chris Ellis, John Gant, and Luke Dykstra. On July 21, 2017, in the Braves' 12–3 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, García helped his team's cause with his first grand slam, while also picking up the win on the mound in what would be his final start for Atlanta. In 18 starts with the Braves, García had a 4–7 record with an ERA of 4.30 in 113 innings.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn July 24, 2017, the Braves traded García and Anthony Recker to the Minnesota Twins for prospect Huascar Ynoa. A free agent at season's end, García was reportedly involved in trade discussions before even making a start for Minnesota, as they were quickly falling behind Cleveland and Kansas City in the AL Central standings. García debuted for the Twins against Oakland on July 28. He made only one start for the Twins, giving up three runs in innings while striking out seven for a win.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn July 30, 2017, the Twins traded García and cash considerations to the New York Yankees in exchange for minor league pitchers Dietrich Enns and Zack Littell. Minnesota opted to pick up the remainder of García's $12 million salary for 2017, leaving New York to pay the pro-rated minimum. He became the first pitcher to start three consecutive games for three separate teams since Gus Weyhing in 1895. He also became the first pitcher ever to start for three different teams in only 15 days: the previous record was 23 days, by Ed Daily and Ron Darling.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn February 15, 2018, García signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. The contract includes a team option for the 2019 season. García made his first start for the Blue Jays on April 2 against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched six innings, allowing one run on four hits while striking out seven, and earned a no-decision in Toronto's 4–2 victory. García earned his first win as a Blue Jay in his next start, throwing 5 innings and allowing 3 runs in Toronto's 7–4 win against the Texas Rangers. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list on May 18 and was activated on May 26. He was placed on the disabled list for a second time with left shoulder inflammation on June 23, and was activated on July 15. On August 25, García was designated for assignment. He was released on August 29.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn August 31, 2018, García signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. He had his contract selected on September 4.\nOn January 9, 2019, García announced his retirement.\nPitching style.\nFour pitches comprised García's arsenal: fastball that reached approximately , curveball, slider and changeup. Manager Mike Matheny has called the movement on his pitches \"baffling\" and \"wipeout\".\nPersonal life.\nGarcía is a Christian. García has two sisters, Karina and Aimee García. García has partnered with the charity Water Mission."

        "text": "Boyd Gail Harris Jr. (October 15, 1931 – November 14, 2012) was an American professional baseball first baseman who played for the New York Giants and Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB) during all or part of six seasons between and . In , Harris hit a career high 20 home runs with the Tigers. Harris batted and threw left-handed and was listed as tall and .\nBaseball career.\nEarly life.\nHarris was born in Abingdon, Virginia, and was an athletic standout at now-defunct William King High School in Abingdon.\nNew York Giants.\nHe signed with Giants at age 18 in 1950 and spent 5 seasons in their farm system before making his debut on June 3, 1955. With Whitey Lockman shifting to left field, Harris became the Giants' starting first baseman for the rest of the season. But he batted only .232 in 79 games played, and lost the starting job to future eight-time National League All-Star Bill White. Harris hit only .132 with the 1956 Giants and spent most of the season at Triple-A. In , the Giants' last season in New York City, White entered the military and opened up a spot for Harris as the team's backup first baseman. On September 21, Harris hit the last homer by a New York Giants player, off Red Witt of the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field, part of a four-hit, seven-RBI day. He appeared as a pinch hitter in Giants' penultimate game at the Polo Grounds on September 28, fouling out in the eighth inning of a 1–0 defeat. For the season, Harris hit .240 with nine home runs in 90 games played. On January 28, 1958, he was traded by the relocated San Francisco Giants to the Detroit Tigers with third baseman Ozzie Virgil for third baseman Jim Finigan and cash.\nDetroit Tigers.\nThe trade set up Harris' best MLB season. He began in a backup role to right-handed swinging Ray Boone. But in mid-June, with Harris hitting over .300, Detroit swapped Boone to the Chicago White Sox and Harris became the Tigers' starting first baseman. Appearing in a career-high 134 games, starting 112 at first base, he established career bests in runs (63), hits (123), extra-base hits (46, including his 20 homers), runs batted in (82), and batting average (.278).\nBut he could not sustain that production in . Mired in a horrible early-season slump (as were the Tigers, who lost 15 of their first 17 games), Harris was hitting as low as .149 on May 22. He didn't exceed the .200 mark until the last day of July before finishing the year at .221 with only nine home runs. The following year, Norm Cash became the Tigers' everyday first baseman.

        "title": "Motor Cycling (magazine)",
        "text": "Motor Cycling was the first British motorcycle magazine. It was launched in 1902 by Temple Press as an offshoot of Motor magazine. It was withdrawn after a few months but relaunched in 1909. The Motor Cycle—which was launched by Iliffe in April 1903—coined the slogan on its masthead: \"Established in 1903 and for over six years the only paper solely devoted to the pastime\".\n the front covers often had varying degree of green background, green or contrasting text and B&amp;W illustrations or photographic images. This common theme resulted in almost a 'trademark' appearance, being called \"The Green 'un\", distinguishing it from its rival publication \"The Motor Cycle\" which had variation on blue background colouring with contrasting text and images (\"The Blue 'un\").\nEarly years.\nGraham Walker edited the magazine from 1938 to 1954. He was a dispatch rider in the First World War and had a successful racing career with Rudge, Sunbeam, and Norton, winning the Ulster Grand Prix in 1928. He rode many times in the Isle of Man TT, winning the lightweight (250cc) class in 1931, and became president of the TT Riders Association. He was also the father of racing commentator Murray Walker.\nMany issues throughout the 1940s and 1950s had the strapline \"Read wherever motorcycles are ridden!\"\nLater years.\nIn 1959 it became \"Motor Cycling with Scooter Weekly\". The magazine continued until 1962 when it changed to newspaper format, later merging in 1967 with \"Motor Cycle\" which had hitherto remained as magazine format.\nTraditionally, Motor Cycling had a sporting-bias whilst Motor Cycle had more of a technical grounding. In his first-page article of the last magazine-format of Motor Cycle dated 3 August 1967, editor-in-chief of the new venture Harry Louis stated:\n\"\"Besides bringing two famous, long-established publications together, we are uniting the star writers on both into one team operating from Dorset House.\"\n\"These enthusiasts who, basically all-rounders but with specialized interests when they punch their typewriters, form the most experienced, knowledgeable and liveliest bunch of motor-cycling journalists ever in our field.\"\nThe two publications continued as one in the newspaper format, initially using the name \"Motor Cycle Incorporating Motor Cycling\" under Motor Cycle publishers Iliffe Specialist Publications Ltd.\n\"\"The printing will be by the latest process, web-offset, which gives much brighter reproduction of pictures than has been possible in the past. With about twice as much space as in this issue, the new \"Motor Cycle\" brings you all the features you expect plus much more extensive coverage of sport and news\".\"\n\"Motor Cycling\" was dropped from the title. Some staff had transferred over to the new venture, whilst others went freelance, such as former staff-writer and racing enthusiast Bruce Main-Smith who had a very successful career including as a publisher of his own motorcycling books which business he sold, including rights to use the name, in 1991 when retiring. This business operated using the name \"Bruce Main-Smith &amp; Company Ltd.\" up to 2013, with the business becoming associated with The National Motorcycle Museum during 2014.\nMick Woollet stayed, becoming sports editor, eventually progressing to editor of Motor Cycle which was later renamed \"Motor Cycle Weekly\" prior to closure in 1983. Woollett was already involved in The Classic Motor Cycle and went on to other projects under IPC magazines and IPC Press.\nA publication having a similar name – \"Motor Cycling Weekly,\" in the newspaper format – was established by some former staff after closure of Motor Cycle/Motor Cycle Weekly including Nick Harris, who later became a motor sport television commentator. Several issues only were sold in the UK during late 1983 and early 1984 before abandonment of the project."

He became the 10th Indian player to perform the feat, and the third player to score a century on debut at the ground. In the next match at Trent Bridge, he made 136 and became the third batsman to make a century in each of his first two innings. He is eighth in the list of leading Test century makers for India. His highest score of 239his only double centurywas made against Pakistan in 2007 at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore.

        "text": "Baseball Magazine was a baseball magazine, the first monthly baseball magazine published in the United States. The magazine was founded by Boston sportswriter Jake Morse prior to the 1908 season. It continued publishing until September 1957. The magazine was resurrected for a short reprieve from November 1964 through April 1965, before folding again. The magazine was based in Boston.\nMorse stated that his mission in starting \"Baseball Magazine\" was to \"fill the need of a monthly organ filled with the highest thought surrounding the game, well edited, well printed, and filled with first class illustrations.\"\n The magazine also strove to provide human interest stories about baseball stars, such as Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson. F.C. Lane became the magazine's editor in 1911 and remained in that post until 1937. One of Lane's first issues was devoted to Cobb, including stories about him and a Q&amp;A session with him. Morse had previously devoted issues to Cy Young in 1908, shortly after baseball commemorated Cy Young Day, and to Addie Joss in 1911, shortly after Joss' death. Despite the magazine's reverence for Young and Mathewson, in 1909 Morse wrote an article in \"Baseball Magazine\" proclaiming former Providence Grays pitcher Charles Radbourn to be \"the greatest pitcher who ever lived.\" Another famous article from the magazine's early days described how difficult it was to be a catcher in baseball's early days.\nDuring the 1920s the magazine complained about players being paid to act as baseball writers."

        "text": "The 2005–06 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team represented Syracuse University. The head coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 30th year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 23–12 (7–9) record, while being eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\nThe team was led by Gerry McNamara, the team's lone senior. Also seeing time in the starting lineup were juniors Darryl Watkins, Louie McCroskey, Demetris Nichols and Terrence Roberts, and freshman Eric Devendorf.\nDue to NCAA sanctions for use of ineligible players, all wins from this season have been vacated.\nSeason recap.\nSyracuse started off the season losing Josh Pace, Hakim Warrick and Craig Forth to graduation, leaving McNamara as the only consistent returning starter from the 2004–05 team. After starting the season 15–2, Syracuse struggled, losing four in a row to Connecticut, Villanova, Pittsburgh and Seton Hall. The Orange would go 4–5 the rest of the way, including an emotional 92–82 loss to Villanova at the Carrier Dome, despite 29 points from McNamara in his final home game.\nAfter McNamara's home send-off, Syracuse then captured the most unlikely of its Big East Tournament Championships, fueled by the heroics of Gerry McNamara. Prior to the conference tournament two separate publications, \"Sports Illustrated\" and the \"Syracuse Post-Standard\" conducted polls of Big East players and assistant coaches. In each poll, McNamara was voted the Big East's \"Most Overrated\" player.\nIn the first round he hit a running one-handed three-point shot with less than a second left in the game to spur Syracuse past the University of Cincinnati, 74–73. Following the game Jim Boeheim unleashed a passionate defense of his star player to the attending media.\nThe next day McNamara hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds of regulation to tie number-one ranked Connecticut and eventually led Syracuse to an overtime 86–84 upset. McNamara finished with 17 points and 13 assists, one assist shy of the Big East Tournament record.\nSyracuse fell behind Georgetown University in the tournament's semi-finals, Syracuse's third game in three days. McNamara hit five three-pointers in the second half—including one in the last minute of the game—to slash the Hoyas' lead to one. He dished out an assist to freshman guard Eric Devendorf to put Syracuse in the lead following a Georgetown turnover and forced another turnover in the closing seconds to clinch the game, 58–57.\nMcNamara had 14 points and 6 assists in Syracuse's 65–61 championship game win over the University of Pittsburgh. Syracuse became the first team to win four games in four days and capture the Big East Tournament Championship.\nHowever, the thrill of Syracuse's unlikely run to the Big East Championship was dampened by a first round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament. Severely hobbled by his leg injury and exhausted from the run in the Big East tournament, McNamara was only able to score two points in just 23 minutes of play as fifth-seeded Syracuse was upset by 12th-seeded Texas A&amp;M University, 66–58."

He played college football at Northern Arizona University.\nEarly years.\nLewis attended Horizon High School where he was an All-conference and All-city selection in football, baseball and basketball. He gained over 1,000 rushing yards in his last 2 seasons in football. As a senior in baseball, he batted for a .492 average and tallied a 3–1 record as a pitcher.\nHe accepted a scholarship from Northern Arizona University, where he became a four-year starter at quarterback (41 straight starts) and a three-time team captain. After being redshirted in 1991, he finished his college career with 785 completions of 1,315 passes for 9,655 yards and 67 touchdowns. At the time he was second on the school's all-time list in passing yards (9,655), completions (785), attempts (1,316), pass completion percentage (59.7) and touchdowns (67). He also set the NCAA Division I-AA career record for interception avoidance (1.82).\nIn 2003, he was inducted into the Northern Arizona Athletics Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nDenver Broncos.\nLewis was selected by the Denver Broncos in the fourth round (100th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was the third-string quarterback. The next year, he was named the backup behind John Elway and was seen as the heir apparent to the future hall of famer.\nIn 1998, he was lost for the season after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament while playing a pickup basketball game and made matters worse by hiding how he suffered the injury.\nHe fell out of favor with head coach Mike Shanahan and was traded to the Carolina Panthers, in exchange for a 1999 third round (#67-Chris Watson) and a 2000 fourth round draft choice (#112-Cooper Carlisle) on March 1, 1999.\nCarolina Panthers.\nThe Carolina Panthers acquired Lewis in 1999, because new head coach George Seifert saw potential in Lewis' athletic ability and wanted to eventually replace starter Steve Beuerlein.\nIn 2001, Lewis was named the starter after Beuerlein was released. He had a bad preseason, including a game where he threw three interceptions in four attempts, which eventually led to him be released on August 31. Rookie Chris Weinke was given the starter job and proceeded to go 1-15 during the regular season.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn February 19, 2002, he signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints. He was released on August 19.\nColorado Crush.\nOn January 30, 2003, he was signed by the Colorado Crush of the Arena Football League. He was promoted to the active roster on April 4.\nPersonal life.\nLewis died on January 5, 2013, at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. An autopsy revealed the cause of death was an accidental drug overdose caused by a mix of morphine and zolpidem (Ambien). At the time of his death, he was the wide receivers coach at Northern Arizona, after serving at Louisville as an offensive administrative assistant from 2007 to 2008 and wide receivers coach in 2009. He had one son, Elijah Jaymes."

Billy Williams and Manny Sanguillén hit back-to-back singles, with Sanguillen's sending Williams to third base. Lee May hit into a fielder's choice, forcing Sanguillen out at second, but permitting Williams to score. After Ron Santo grounded into a double play, the score was tied at 3, forcing extra innings.\nIn the bottom of the tenth inning, Dave McNally came on in relief for the AL. The first batter he faced, Nate Colbert (pinch hitting for Tug McGraw), walked. Colbert advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Chris Speier. Joe Morgan singled, scoring Colbert and ending the game.\nGame notes and records.\nTug McGraw was credited with the win. Dave McNally was charged with the loss.\nThis was the fifth All-Star Game to reach extra innings. After this one, the National League was 5–0 in those extra inning games.\nThe home run hit by Hank Aaron was the last one in an All-Star Game by a player from the host team for 25 years. This did not happen again until Sandy Alomar Jr. of the Cleveland Indians homered at Jacobs Field in the 1997 All-Star Game.\nThe homer by Cookie Rojas, a native of Cuba, was the first one ever hit in an All-Star Game for the American League by a player who was born outside the United States.\nNate Colbert, who scored the winning run, brought the wrong uniform with him to Atlanta. The San Diego Padres' slugger donned his road jersey with \"SAN DIEGO\" on it instead of his home one with \"PADRES\" on it. Both of San Diego's jerseys in 1972 and 1973 were gold. Seven days after the All-Star Game, Colbert racked up 13 RBI in a doubleheader vs. the Braves in the same stadium, setting a Major League record for a twinbill which was tied in 1993 by Mark Whiten for the St. Louis Cardinals.\nWith Toby Harrah injured, the Texas Rangers did not have an active player on the AL squad in their first season in Arlington, Texas. The Rangers were originally the second incarnation of the Washington Senators, leaving the nation's capital in November 1971 after 11 seasons.\nPlayers from the Red Sox and Giants debuted double-knit uniforms in this game. After the Pirates (1970), Cardinals and Orioles (each in 1971) were the first teams to switch, two-thirds of MLB (16 of 24) donned new double-knits to begin 1972. The three remaining teams wearing flannels full-time, the Expos, Royals and Yankees, switched to double-kits to start 1973."

        "title": "Giro d'Italia records and statistics",
        "text": "Since the first Giro d'Italia in 1909, there have been 2,074 stages. This number includes half-stages, prologues, and a small number of stages cancelled mid-race or immediately before the start. This number is up to date after the 2023 Giro. Since 1931, the race leader following each stage has been awarded the pink jersey ().\nAlthough the leader of the classification after each stage gets a pink jersey, he is not considered the winner of the pink jersey, only the wearer. Only after the final stage is complete, the wearer of the pink jersey is considered the winner of the pink jersey, and thereby the winner of the Giro d'Italia. In 2020, British rider Tao Geoghegan Hart became the first cyclist to win the overall pink jersey, having never worn it during the race itself.\nIn this article first-place-classifications before 1931 are also counted as if a pink jersey was awarded. Nonetheless, the number of pink jerseys awarded is not equal to the number of stages. In the 1912 Giro d'Italia, the race was contested by teams, so no individual cyclist is counted in this statistic. Sometimes more cyclists were leading the classification (1925 after stages 2 and 3, 1929 after stage 2, 1936 after stage 6, 1938 after stages 2 and 3, 1957 after stage 18 and 1973 after the prologue). On the other hand, jerseys were not awarded in between any of the 51 pairs of half-stages that took place during the history of the Giro. Thus, as of 2023, 2,025 pink jerseys have been awarded in the Giro d'Italia to 285 different riders.\nIndividual records.\nKey:\nIn previous Giri d'Italia, sometimes a stage was split in two. On such occasions, only the cyclist leading at the end of the day is counted. The \"Maglia Rosa\" column gives the number of days that the cyclist \"wore\" the pink jersey, the \"Giro wins\" column gives the number of days that the cyclist \"won\" the pink jersey. The next four columns indicate the number of times the rider won the points classification, the King of the Mountains classification, and the young rider competition, and the years in which the pink jersey was worn, with bold years indicating an overall Giro win. For example: Eddy Merckx has spent 78 stages as leader of the race, won the general classification five times; won the points classification two times, won the mountains classification one time, and never won the young rider classification. He wore the pink jersey in the 1968, 1970, 1972, 1973, and 1974 editions of the race (which he all won) as well as 1969 (which he did not win).\nAfter Alberto Contador was stripped from his victory in the 2011 Giro d'Italia, Michele Scarponi became the new winner.\nPer country.\nThe pink jersey has been awarded to 28 different countries since 1903. In the table below, \"Jerseys\" indicates the number of pink jerseys that were given to cyclists of each country. \"Giro wins\" stands for the number of Giro wins by cyclists of that country, \"Points\" for the number of times the points classification was won by a cyclist of that country, \"KoM\" for the number of times the mountains classification was won by a cyclist of that country, and \"White\" for the number of times the young rider classification was won by a cyclist of that country.\nThe \"Most recent\" column shows the cyclist of the country that lead the general classification most recently. The \"Different holders\" column gives the number of different cyclists of the country that lead the general classification.\n\"Updated until after Stage 20 of the 2023 Giro d'Italia\"\nStage wins.\nStage wins per rider.\nsome 34 riders have won more than 10 stages at the Giro.\nactive riders are in bold "

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics was held at the Beijing National Indoor Stadium on August 9 and 14. There were 98 competitors from 35 nations. The event was won by Yang Wei of China, the nation's first victory in the event since 1996 and second overall. Yang, who had earned silver in 2000, was the 13th man to receive multiple medals in the individual all-around (and the first to do so in non-consecutive Games). Japan's Kōhei Uchimura took silver; it was the first medal in the event for Japan since 1984, the last of a four-decade stretch where the nation reached the podium every time it competed (7 of 8 Games from 1956 to 1984, with Japan boycotting the 1980 Games). Benoît Caranobe of France took bronze, the first men's all-around medal for that nation since 1920.\nBackground.\nThis was the 25th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nSix of the top 10 gymnasts from the 2004 Games returned: silver medalist Kim Dae-Eun and bronze medalist Yang Tae Young of South Korea, fifth-place finisher Rafael Martínez of Spain, sixth-place finisher Hiroyuki Tomita of Japan, seventh-place finisher (and 2000 silver medalist) Yang Wei of China, and eighth-place finisher Marian Drăgulescu of Romania. Tomita had won the World Championship in 2005; Yang Wei had won the next two in 2006 and 2007 (the first repeat champion since the 1920s) and was the heavy favorite coming into the Games.\nUzbekistan, Venezuela, and Yemen each made their debut in the event. France made its 23rd appearance, most among nations.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's artistic gymnastics in 2008 was based entirely on the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The top 12 teams at the world championships could send a full team of 6 gymnasts to the Olympics. The next 3 teams (#13 through #15) could send 2 gymnasts. The 3 teams after that (#16 through #18) could send 1 gymnast. The next 7 individual gymnasts (only from nations without any qualified gymnasts yet) and apparatus gold medal winners also qualified. The FIG Executive Board made invitational selections to ensure host country and continental representation and the Tripartite Commission made an invitation. The quota of 98 gymnasts was then filled through additional individual gymnasts.\nCompetition format.\nIn the third straight Games with a significant format change, the Code of Points was implemented. Rather than exercise scores being scored on a 0 to 10 scale (the \"perfect 10\" system), scoring was now based on two separate scores that were then combined in order to come to the final score. The A score measured the difficulty of each element (and combinations of elements) within the routine, while the B score evaluated the performance, ie, the \"execution, composition and artistry\" of the routine. There was no longer a theoretical top score.\nThe rest of the format remained the same as before. There was a preliminary round and a final. All gymnasts were ranked based on the sum of their exercise scores for all six apparatus, which gave an all-around qualification score. (Gymnasts that did not compete on every apparatus, of course, having significantly lower scores than those who did.) The top 24 competitors moved on to the individual all-around final, though nations were limited to two competitors each even if more qualified.\nIn the individual all-around final, each gymnast competed on each apparatus again. Only scores from the final were used to determine final rankings.\nResults.\nThe twenty-four competitors with the highest scores in qualifying proceed to the men's artistic individual all-around finals."

The eight competitors (with a maximum of two per nation) with the highest scores in qualifying, among the gymnasts electing to make two vaults, proceeded to the men's vault finals. There, each gymnast performed two vaults; the scores from the final round (ignoring qualification) determined final ranking. There were 16 competitors from 13 nations that made a second vault attempt. The event was won by Leszek Blanik of Poland, the nation's first victory in the men's vault. Blanik was the seventh man to win multiple medals in the event, adding to his 2000 bronze. France earned its first medal in the event with Thomas Bouhail's silver. Anton Golotsutskov of Russia took bronze, putting the nation back on the podium after a one-Games absence.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Two of the eight finalists from 2004 returned: bronze medalist Marian Drăgulescu of Romania and fourth-place finisher Kyle Shewfelt of Canada. Three others (two-time gold medalist Gervasio Deferr of Spain, seventh-place finisher Li Xiaopeng of China, and sixth-place finisher Róbert Gál of Hungary) competed in Beijing but did not make the two vault attempts necessary to participate in the vault event. Leszek Blanik of Poland, the 2000 bronze medalist, was the reigning (2007) world champion and 2005 runner-up; Drăgulescu had won in 2001, 2005, and 2006. Drăgulescu was favored in the event.\nYemen made its debut in the men's vault. Italy made its 18th appearance, most of any nation competing in the vault in 2008 but one behind the United States (which had male gymnasts in Beijing but none who performed two vaults in the qualifying).\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's artistic gymnastics in 2008 was based entirely on the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The top 12 teams at the world championships could send a full team of 6 gymnasts to the Olympics. The next 3 teams (#13 through #15) could send 2 gymnasts.

The FIG Executive Board made invitational selections to ensure host country and continental representation and the Tripartite Commission made an invitation. The quota of 98 gymnasts was then filled through additional individual gymnasts.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 gymnastics competition had introduced the \"7–6–5\" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. In 2000, this was reduced across the board to a \"6–5–4\" format; the 2008 competition kept this format. Further, while in 1996 all 7 team members could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes, since 2000 only the 5 designated for that apparatus competed. The 2000 competition had also eliminated the compulsory exercises; only voluntary exercises were done on each apparatus. The qualifying round scores were used for qualification for the team all-around, individual all-around, and apparatus finals. An additional complication was added in 2008: most gymnasts needed to perform only one vault exercise for the team and individual all-around qualifying, while those who wanted to compete in the vault apparatus performed two vaults (with the average of the two scores counting).\nThe top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 16th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise. For the vault, the final consisted of two attempts per gymnast, with the average score of the two counting.\nScoring in artistic gymnastics is based on two separate scores that are then combined in order to come to the final score. The A score measures the difficulty of each element (and combinations of elements) within the routine, while the B score evaluates the performance, ie, the \"execution, composition and artistry\" of the routine. For further information, please see the Code of Points article.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nOnly gymnasts performing two vaults during the qualification round were considered for the vault final. The average score of the two vaults was the preliminary score. The top 8 gymnasts, with a limit of 2 per nation, qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe tie between Blanik and Bouhail was broken by the highest individual vault (Blanik's best was 16.600 in his first vault, Bouhail's best was 16.575 in his first vault).\nThe reserves for the vault event final were:"

Anton Fokin won Uzbekistan's first parallel bars medal in its debut as an independent nation.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the eight finalists from 2004 returned: gold medalist Valeriy Honcharov of Ukraine, silver medalist Hiroyuki Tomita of Japan, bronze medalist Li Xiaopeng of China, and sixth-place finisher Yann Cucherat of France. Mitja Petkovšek of Slovenia had won the 2005 and 2007 world championships, sharing the latter with Kim Dae-Eun of South Korea; Yang Wei of China was victorious in 2006.\nUzbekistan and Venezuela each made their debut in the men's parallel bars. The United States made its 20th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 event and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's artistic gymnastics in 2008 was based entirely on the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The top 12 teams at the world championships could send a full team of 6 gymnasts to the Olympics. The next 3 teams (#13 through #15) could send 2 gymnasts. The 3 teams after that (#16 through #18) could send 1 gymnast. The next 7 individual gymnasts (only from nations without any qualified gymnasts yet) and apparatus gold medal winners also qualified. The FIG Executive Board made invitational selections to ensure host country and continental representation and the Tripartite Commission made an invitation. The quota of 98 gymnasts was then filled through additional individual gymnasts.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 gymnastics competition had introduced the \"7–6–5\" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. In 2000, this was reduced across the board to a \"6–5–4\" format; the 2008 competition kept this format. Further, while in 1996 all 7 team members could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes, since 2000 only the 5 designated for that apparatus competed. The 2000 competition had also eliminated the compulsory exercises; only voluntary exercises were done on each apparatus. The qualifying round scores were used for qualification for the team all-around, individual all-around, and apparatus finals.\nThe top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 75th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise.\nScoring in artistic gymnastics under the Code of Points is based on two separate scores that are then combined in order to come to the final score. The D score measures the difficulty of each element (and combinations of elements) within the routine, while the E score evaluates the performance, ie, the \"execution, composition and artistry\" of the routine.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nThe top 8 gymnasts, with a limit of 2 per nation, qualified for the final."

In this procedure there are six judges who judge each competitor on a scale of 1-10. When all six scores are finalised, the highest and lowest are eliminated and the remaining four are averaged. The first tiebreaking procedure is determined by the E score, the execution score.

Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout."

        "text": "The men's épée fencing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing took place on August 10 at the Olympic Green Convention Centre. There were 41 competitors from 23 nations. The event was won by Matteo Tagliariol of Italy, the nation's first victory in the event since 1960 (the last of six consecutive wins) and first medal of any color since 1968. It was Italy's seventh overall victory, most among nations. The silver medal went to Fabrice Jeannet of France. José Luis Abajo earned Spain's first men's individual épée medal with his bronze. The Russian fencers' streak of five Games on the podium (including Russian fencers for the Soviet Union in 1988 and Unified Team in 1992) ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the 25th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nThree of the eight quarterfinalists from 2004 returned: silver medalist Wang Lei of China, fifth-place finisher Fabrice Jeannet of France, and sixth-place finisher Silvio Fernández of Venezuela. The reigning (2007) World Champion was Krisztián Kulcsár of Hungary. Wang had won in 2006.\nFor only the second time in Olympic history (after 1932), no nations made their debut in the event. France and the United States each appeared for the 23rd time, tied for most among nations.\nQualification.\nNations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of men's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. Men's foil was the first event to which this applied to, so the 2008 individual épée competition continued to allow three fencers per nation.\nThere were 39 dedicated quota spots for men's épée. The 24 fencers from the 8 teams qualified for the team event were all automatically qualified for the individual event. Next, the top 3 men in the FIE Individual Ranking received spots. After that, 7 more men were selected from the ranking based on continents: 2 from Europe, 2 from the Americas, 2 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa; each nation could only earn one spot from this continental ranking, but it could be added to any spots from the world ranking (up to three total). Finally, five spots were allocated by continental qualifying events: 2 from Europe, 1 from the Americas, 1 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa. Nations could only earn one spot from these events and only if they had no fencer qualified through rankings.\nAdditionally, there were 8 host/invitational spots that could be spread throughout the various fencing events. China used only 2 of those places to max out its representation in all events (both in the men's épée, for which only Wang Lei qualified directly), so 6 spots were assigned by Tripartite Commission invitation. None were used in the men's épée, so the total number of competitors was 41: the 39 dedicated places plus 2 host places.\nCompetition format.\nThe épée competition, following the format introduced in 1996, consisted of a six-round single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match between the two semifinal losers. Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout."

Sanzo had won the 2001 and 2005 World Championships; Joppich had won in 2003, 2006, and 2007. The runner-up in Joppich's latest two titles, Andrea Baldini of Italy, had tested positive for a banned diuretic and could not compete (though he was later cleared and competed in 2012). This made Joppich a heavy favorite.\nQatar and Thailand each made their debut in the men's foil. France and the United States each made their 23rd appearance, tied for most of any nation; France had missed only the 1904 (with fencers not traveling to St. Louis) and the 1912 (boycotted due to a dispute over rules) foil competitions, while the United States had missed the inaugural 1896 competition and boycotted the 1980 Games altogether.\nQualification.\nNations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928.

        "title": "Rugby league in Queensland",
        "text": "Rugby league in Queensland is the most watched winter sport in the state and the second most participated football code after soccer. Rugby league was introduced in 1908 and within just a few years it surpassed rugby union there to become the most popular football code as players switched to play professionally in the Queensland Rugby League. In the 1920s, Queenslanders began leaving to play professionally in the New South Wales Rugby League which became a more popular competition. However Queensland maintained a strong rugby league culture, with the state continuing to perform well in interstate rugby league. The later advent of the State of Origin series ensured that players would return to represent their state.\nQueensland is home to four professional clubs, the Brisbane Broncos (1987), North Queensland Cowboys (1992), Gold Coast Titans (2007) and The Dolphins (2023) all participating in the National Rugby League. Lang Park, the spiritual home of the code in Queensland, is home to the two Brisbane based clubs. The Broncos, the oldest and most popular in the state, records the highest annual revenue of all NRL clubs. Along with financial competitiveness, the Broncos have been voted one of Australia's most popular and most watched football teams, and has one of the highest average attendances of any rugby league club in the world; 33,337 in the 2012 NRL season.\nQueensland origin legends include: Wally Lewis, Darren Lockyer, Mal Meninga, Johnathan Thurston, Arthur Beetson, Shane Webcke, Gordon Tallis, Wendell Sailor, Greg Inglis, Bob Lindner, Trevor Gillmeister, Cameron Smith, Billy Slater, Paul Vautin, Lote Tuquiri, and Petero Civoniceva.\nHistory.\nRugby Football in Queensland.\nThe earliest record of rugby football being played in Queensland is in 1876, when the Brisbane Football Club, formed in 1866 to play 'Victorian Rules', commenced playing according to the recently codified Rugby (Union) rules, to fit in with two newly formed football clubs (Rangers and Bonnet Rouge), before reverting to Australian Rules (with occasional Rugby matches) in 1879. The Queensland Rugby Union was subsequently constituted as the Northern Rugby Union in 1883, and a year later the first organised club competition took place in Brisbane. By 1887, the switch of private schools to rugby and regular contests between Queensland and New South Wales saw rugby's popularity overtake the Australian code, resulting in its complete demise in the colony by 1892.\nIntroduction of Rugby League and impact of Professionalism.\nOn 16 May 1908 the first game of rugby league was played in the state when the touring New Zealand team played Queensland at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground.\nThe advent of professional rugby league in New South Wales saw many Queensland rugby players leaving for Sydney to play rugby league.\nFirst Competitions.\nIn 1908, the Queensland Rugby Union banned its players from going to Sydney to play rugby league, which resulted in disgruntled players forming the Queensland Amateur Rugby Football League (QARFL) (later renamed Queensland Rugby League). The new organisation was attacked by the local press and the QRU for introducing professionalism, which they claimed would destroy the sport. The first official club competition kicked off in Brisbane on May 8, 1909.\nThe league put down strong roots in the bush and in working class communities and these areas are still the heartland of the modern game of rugby league. Between 1914 and 1918 some major rugby union clubs switched to rugby league. By 1920, rugby union ceased to exist in Queensland. \nIn 1922 the Brisbane Rugby Football League (BRFL, later BRL) was formed out of dissatisfaction with the way the QRL ran the game. Those involved took particular exception to the salary being earned by Harry Sunderland as secretary of the QRL. It remained the premier competition in Queensland for 75 years and the premier level of rugby league in the state until 1988.\nBy the late-1970s, crowds began to desert the BRL competition. Clubs found themselves in financial hardship, and the public began to support the Sydney competition which by then was being broadcast in Queensland. However, a small resurgence in the popularity of the Brisbane competition occurred after Queensland dominated the Interstate Series under new State of Origin rules. A statewide top tier short-format competition similar to the NSWRL's Amco Cup - the Winfield State League would run in parallel to the BRL competition from 1982 to 1995.\nDemise of the BRL into a Second Tier Competition.\nFrom 1909 to 1987, the Queensland Rugby Football League Premiership and the Brisbane Rugby League were considered to be top tier competitions parallel to the NSWRL premiership. This changed when, in 1988, the newly formed Brisbane Broncos and the Gold Coast-Tweed Giants joined the New South Wales Rugby League premiership. This led to the Brisbane Rugby League premiership being considered by most senior rugby league historians to have become a second-tier league in this year, as almost all of the top players in the competition left to play for either of the two new Queensland franchises in the NSWRL, including Wally Lewis, Gene Miles, Colin Scott, Joe Kilroy, Bryan Niebling, Greg Conescu, and Greg Dowling who all joined the QRL's original bid, the Brisbane Broncos.\nLocal Competitions after the NSWRL Expansion.\nAfter the Broncos and Giants joined the NSWRL, the Brisbane Rugby League, along with its companion statewide competition the Winfield State League, remained, at least officially, first tier competitions. Both competitions eventually merged with each other into the statewide Queensland Cup in 1996, and after existing as a short post-season tournament to find a Brisbane champion in 1996 and 1997, the BRL was officially disbanded after 75 seasons in 1997.\nThe Brisbane Rugby League (2001) was re-established as a third-tier competition below the NRL and Queensland Cup. This completed a remarkable fall from grace for the local Brisbane competition in stature, from a top level competition alongside the NSWRL until 1987, to a second-tier league from 1988 to 1997 and then a third-tier league from 2001, although most BRL clubs joined the Queensland Cup exclusively in 1998 and their reserve grade teams compete in the current BRL competition along with community clubs.\nGoverning body.\nThe Queensland Rugby League (QRL) is the governing body for the sport of rugby league in Queensland. It is a member of the Australian Rugby League (ARL) and selects the members of Queensland State of Origin teams.\nNational Rugby League.\nThe National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia's top-level competition for the sport of rugby league.\nThe first Queensland teams joined the New South Wales Rugby League Premiership (the forerunner to the NRL) in 1988, which ultimately led to the downfall of the local Brisbane Premiership. These teams to begin play in the NSWRL were the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast-Tweed Giants. Following this, the NSWRL expanded again in 1995, changing its name to the Australian Rugby League (ARL) to reflect the growth of the competition from a state based league into creating two Queensland expansion teams, the North Queensland Cowboys (Townsville) and South Queensland Crushers (Brisbane). However, the Super League War led to the demise of the South Queensland Crushers and the Gold Coast Chargers (name change of the aforementioned Giants), who were culled by the league at the end of the 1997 and 1998 seasons respectively. In 2007, after nine years, top level rugby league returned to the Gold Coast with the admission of the Gold Coast Titans to the NRL. As of 2021, there is great speculation that a second Brisbane team to finally replace the Crushers franchise of the 1990s will be added in the next few seasons.\nThere are four Queensland based teams in the NRL: Brisbane Broncos, Dolphins, Gold Coast Titans, and North Queensland Cowboys.\nThe Gold Coast Chargers played in the 1988-1998 seasons and the South Queensland Crushers competed from 1995 to 1997.\nMajor competitions in Queensland.\nQueensland Cup.\nThe Queensland Cup has been contested since 1996. Since 1998 the team winning the Queensland Cup is considered to be the premier club team in Queensland. This is because in 1996 and 1997 it was contested parallel to the Brisbane Rugby League, which was considered the premier competition in the state.\nThe Queensland Cup grew out of the Winfield State League. Since its formation in 1995, the Queensland Cup has been known as the Queensland Cup, Bundy Gold Cup, Channel 9 Cup. For sponsorship reasons it is currently known as the Intrust Super Cup.\nFOGS Cup &amp; FOGS Colts Challenge.\nAlso known as the FOGS Cup &amp; FOGS Colts Challenge, they are run by the Queensland Rugby League's South East Division. It is made up of 12 clubs, 7 of which play in the Queensland Cup. Generally, it is regarded as the division below the Queensland Cup. The FOGS Cup and FOGS Colts Challenge used to be known as the Quest Cup and Mixwell Cup, respectively.\nFoley Shield.\nThe Foley Shield competition began in North Queensland in 1948. With the introduction of the Queensland Cup in 1996 the Foley Shield competition was scrapped, only to be reintroduced in 2000. Since the revamp in 2000 it has only contested by the three largest cities in North Queensland; Cairns, Mackay and Townsville.\n47th Battalion Shield.\nLike the Northern Division's \"Foley Shield\" or the South-East Division's \"Bulimba Cup\" the \"47th Battalion Shield\" is run as the Central Region's regional Carnival and none of the teams are club teams, with the only exception being some of the Women's teams. Its traditionally held over one weekend and normally at one venue with multiple grounds to play on.\nLocal Competitions.\nThere are over 250 clubs in Queensland, across over 20 competitions:\nRegions.\nThe game in the state is administered by five regions, these being:\nState of Origin.\nThe Queensland State of Origin side is by far Queensland's most loved football team. Purely a representative team, they play three games a year against New South Wales in the competition known as the State of Origin, thus named because players represent their state of birth or the state where they played their first senior game of football. They are currently captained by Daly Cherry-Evans and coached by Billy Slater.\nThe Queensland and New South Wales teams are heavily competitive. During the 1980s Queensland had the upper hand (8 out of 10 to Qld); during the 1990s, factoring in Super League which took out most of the Queensland team (through the Brisbane Broncos), the results were reasonably similar (6 out of 10 to NSW); and during the first decade of the 2000s, New South Wales has had the upper hand, but are by no means dominant (4 out of 7 to NSW, with the most recent to Qld)."

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was held between 9 and 16 August, at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park. There were 32 competitors from 32 nations. The event was won by Olaf Tufte of Norway, the fifth man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the event (and 12th to win multiple medals of any colour). The silver medal went to Ondřej Synek of the Czech Republic, the nation's first medal in the event (though Czech rower Václav Chalupa had earned silver in 1992 for Czechoslovakia). Mahé Drysdale of New Zealand earned bronze. Both Synek and Drysdale would go on to win medals in the event again in 2012 and 2016 (with Drysdale the gold medallist both times).\nBackground.\nThis was the 25th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nEight of the 18 A/B/C semifinalists from the 2004 Games returned: gold medallist Olaf Tufte of Norway, fourth-place finisher Santiago Fernández of Argentina, sixth-place finisher Tim Maeyens of Belgium, seventh-place finisher (and 2000 bronze medallist) Marcel Hacker of Germany, eighth-place finisher André Vonarburg of Switzerland, thirteenth-place finisher (who had taken the same place in 2000) Anderson Nocetti of Brazil, fourteenth-place finisher (and 1996 and 2000 competitor) Ali Ibrahim of Egypt, and eighteenth-place finisher Law Hiu Fung of Hong Kong. Tufte, despite being defending champion, was not the favorite; that was Mahé Drysdale of New Zealand, who had won all three World Championships since the 2008 Games (Tufte had a silver and a bronze in that time). Other contenders included Hacker, trying to come back from a disappointing Final B performance in 2004; Ondřej Synek of the Czech Republic, with a silver and two bronze medals in the last three Worlds; Fernández, the reigning Pan American champion, and Alan Campbell of Great Britain, the Diamond Challenge Sculls winner in 2007. \nCameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Iran, Lithuania, Monaco, and Venezuela each made their debut in the event. Great Britain and the United States each made their 20th appearance, tied for most among nations.\nQualification.\nNations had been limited to one boat (one rower) each since 1912. The 33 qualifiers were:\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. The format continued to use four rounds, as in previous Games, but instead of three main rounds and a repechage, all four rounds were main rounds: there was no repechage. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nDuring the first round six heats were held. The top four boats in each heat advanced to the quarterfinals, while all others were relegated to the E/F semifinals.\nThe quarterfinals were the second round for rowers still competing for medals. Placing in the quarterfinal heats determined which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.\nSix semifinals were held, two each of A/B semifinals, C/D semifinals, and E/F semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats moved on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final.\nThe fourth and final round was the finals. Each final determined a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in the top four of their heat, top three of their quarterfinal, and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe top four in each heat advanced to the quarterfinals, remaining in medal contention. Fifth and sixth placed boats went to the E/F semifinals, eligible for ranking between 25 and 32.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top three boats in each quarterfinal went to the A/B semifinals, still in contention for medals and guaranteed to be in the top 12. Fourth through sixth place boats went to the C/D semifinals, ultimately ranked 13th through 24th.\nSemifinals.\nThe top three boats in each semifinal went to the better final, while the fourth through sixth placed boats went to the lower final."

Allison chose to accept the scholarship and attend Memphis State.\nCollege career.\nAllison played college football for the Memphis State Tigers from 1990 to 1993. In 1992, his junior season at the school, Allison won the Lou Groza Award, awarded to the nation's top placekicker. During the season, Allison made 23 out of 25 field goals, and led the NCAA in both field goals made as well as field goal percentage, where he achieved 92 percent. He also connected on all 32 extra points that he attempted. For the 1992 season, Allison scored a total of 101 points. Allison was also named to the first-team All-American team, the first Memphis State University player in the school's history to be honored with that recognition.\nHe was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.\nProfessional career.\nAllison signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL), but he did not make the roster.\nAllison played a single regular season game for the Memphis Mad Dogs of the Canadian Football League, in which he completed six kick-offs, scored one field goal on three attempts, and made two singles.\nPersonal life.\nJoe Allison's first cousin was Davey Allison, who was a NASCAR race car driver for Robert Yates Racing. Davey was killed in a helicopter accident in 1993. Joe was the godfather to Davey's daughter Krista. Joe and Davey were very close, and after his death, Joe said \"Before I go in to kick, I put my hat down and say, 'Davey, give me the strength to do the best I can, to be as strong as you were.'\""

        "text": "Women's double sculls competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was held between August 9 and 16 at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park.\nThis rowing event is a double scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a pair of rowers. The \"scull\" portion means that each rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side. The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking.\nDuring the first round two heats were held. The top boat in each heat advanced directly to the A final, with all others going to the repechage. The two repechage heats filled out the rest of the finals, with the best two boats in each repechage heat advancing to the A final and the remaining two boats in each repechage going to the B final.\nEach final determined a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave the rest of the rankings, through 10th place.\nIn the A Final, Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell of New Zealand defended their double sculls gold medal from the 2004 Summer Olympics in a highly competitive race which saw them beat the German crew by just 1/100 of a second (7:07.32 versus 7:07.33), and the third-placing British crew by just 0.23 seconds. This was the first time in Olympic history that the Women's Double Sculls title had been successfully defended. "

She thundered home on the final stretch to a spectacular finish with a fastest time in 35.976. Chausson also enjoyed her teammate Laëtitia Le Corguillé taking home the silver in 38.042, as she finished the race behind the leader by nearly seven hundredths of a second (0.07) and also, handed the French squad a straight 1–2 finish on the medal podium. Meanwhile, United States' Jill Kintner came up with a powerful, stalwart ride to earn the bronze in 38.674, edging out New Zealand's Sarah Walker by a short sprint distance.\nQualification.\nSixteen riders representing twelve countries qualified for the event. Qualification was based on UCI ranking by nations, 2008 UCI BMX World Championships results and wild-cards reserved to a \"Tripartite Commission\" (IOC, ANOC, UCI).\nCompetition format.\nEach of the 16 women competing performed two runs of the course in individual time trials to determine seeding for the knockout rounds. Then, they were grouped into 2 semifinal groups based on that seeding. Each semifinal consisted of three runs of the course, using a point-for-place system. The top four cyclists in each semifinal (for a total of 8) moved on to the final. Unlike the semifinals, the final consisted of a single race with the first to the finish line claiming the gold medal."

        "title": "History of the Rugby League Conference",
        "text": "The Rugby League Conference (RLC), also known as the \"Co-operative Rugby League Conference\" as a result of sponsorship from The Co-operative Group, was a series of regionally based divisions of amateur rugby league teams spread throughout England, Scotland and Wales.\nIt was founded in 1997 as the \"Southern Conference League\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn 1895, several clubs in the North of England broke away from the Rugby Football Union (RFU), the governing body of rugby football in England, over the issue of player expenses.\nThis led to the great schism which resulted in rugby becoming two separate sports: rugby union administered by the RFU and rugby league administered by the Rugby Football League as the two games evolved different sets of rules.\nAlthough rugby league spread overseas, sanctions by the RFU made it more difficult for the sport to expand beyond its \"heartlands\" in the traditional counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumberland.\nEarlier non-heartland competitions.\nPrior to the Rugby League Conference, there were several non-heartland leagues throughout England run by the British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA); the most recent ones being the London Amateur Rugby League, the Midlands and South West Amateur Rugby League Association (MASWARLA), the East Midlands Amateur Rugby League Association (EMARLA), the Eastern Counties Amateur Rugby League and the North Eastern Amateur Rugby League Association (NEARLA).\nThe Eastern Counties and the MASWARLA competitions folded in 1995 (as did the Welsh Amateur League of the time) The few remaining teams were absorbed by the London ARL and the EMARLA. The London League initially regionalised its division 2 to cope with the increased travel pressures this caused, but they were unable to keep up numbers for this. While their leagues at the time survived (albeit at a low level) teams in the North East of England and the East Midlands were looking at playing in Yorkshire-based heartland leagues. However teams in the South of England had no such option, London Skolars were even rejected from BARLA's National Conference League for the 1996–97 season.\nA further major factor leading to the creation of the \"Southern Conference League\" was the fact that the professional clubs had switched to a summer season the previous year and thus interest in the sport in the winter was decreased. The abandonment of amateurism by the rival sport of rugby union in 1995 meant that it was now possible for rugby union players to play rugby league during their off-season without risking a ban from rugby union whilst adding an element of competition for players in the winter. This gave non-heartland clubs a larger player pool but only if they switched to summer.\n1997.\nThe \"Southern Conference League\" began as a 10-team pilot league in 1997. The teams selected were not necessarily those with the highest playing standard, as off-field factors were initially considered very important. Furthermore, teams were selected to represent medium to large-sized towns and thus some clubs were considered undesirable, either due to being pub teams or due to being in small towns based too near a large town with a club (the latter being one of the reasons St Ives Roosters were outside the league until 2003).\nThe initial line-up was as follows:\nBirmingham and Leicester Phoenix had been playing in the EMARLA (the former since the demise of the MASWARLA). \nAmong the newly formed clubs were Bedford Swifts, the first ever cross-code club (i.e. playing both rugby union and rugby league), West London (formed from a merger of two of the more successful London ARL teams Brent-Ealing and London Colonials), Oxford Cavaliers and Worcester Royals (though the latter 2 had played friendlies the preceding summer). The other clubs joined from the London ARL including North London Skolars who were based on the student old boys network.\nHowever, before the season started Reading Raiders announced that they would remain in the London ARL, the tenth place being offered to fellow London ARL club Cambridge Eagles, a club that missed out at the first stage of applications. As a result of Cambridge Eagles being more geographically suited to the Eastern Division, Bedford Swifts were switched to the Central Division.\nKingston were to resign from the league after only playing one game, but besides this and a forfeited semi-final this pilot season was generally successful, resulting in an increase of RFL funding to allow further expansion. North London Skolars were the winners of the first and only Southern Conference defeating Leicester Phoenix in the final.\nThe Scottish Conference was also founded in 1997 with five teams and had its first season. However, it would remain outside the Rugby League Conference structure until 2006.\n1998.\nThe newly renamed \"Rugby League Conference\" was founded in 1998 with 14 teams (initially planned to be 15, but the proposed Northampton club failed to materialise) with several new clubs resulting in a reorganisation of the divisional line-ups to three divisions (West, East and South). Of these new clubs St Albans Centurions had previously been playing in the London ARL and Cheltenham had had two clubs in the MASWARLA when that existed. Another new twist was the addition of the monikers of Super League clubs by many clubs, with Worcester becoming the Saints, Birmingham the Bulls and West London the Sharks; some Super League clubs also gave support to the new clubs.\nNorth London Skolars joined the National Conference League after the first season, while retaining a team in the Rugby League Conference.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nIn an all new team final Crawley Jets beat South Norfolk Saints at the Prince of Wales Stadium in Cheltenham.\n1999.\nThe 1999 season saw further expansion to 20 teams, resulting in another change in the divisional system. Initially only 15 clubs were to be funded by the RFL and Hemel Stags were admitted to the East division to fill the gap originally intended for Northampton the previous season after their Northern Ford Premiership application was rejected and the Alliance (reserve grade) was scrapped. However, a change of decision and the collapse of the EMARLA saw this changed. Derby City were welcomed as the final champions of the EMARLA and the other 4 new sides were formed from the ashes of defunct winter clubs. Worcester Saints became Worcestershire Saints after moving to Redditch in the first relocation. For the first time all starting teams finished the season.\nTeam line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nThe title was won by Chester Wolves who defeated Crawley Jets in the final.\n2000.\nThis season saw a relatively modest further expansion to 24 teams, including the return of founder members Kingston. Leicester Phoenix's Chairman Julian Harrison was appointed the new Conference Administrator. This also coincided with the demise of the London ARL as a winter British Amateur Rugby League Association league but saw it reform as a summer based merit league with a combination of reserve teams and new clubs (though South London Storm and Kingston Warriors joined the Rugby League Conference). In a second relocation Cheltenham Warriors moved to Gloucester and became Gloucestershire Warriors. Another rebranding was had by Birmingham Bulls, who became Birmingham Bulldogs to avoid a legal challenge by the Birmingham Bulls American football team.\nThis season also saw a test of summer rugby league in the North East of England, with a Northern Rugby League Summer Conference with teams from various BARLA leagues won by Teesside Steelers, also featuring Gateshead Panthers, Bridlington Bulls, West Craven Warriors and Wetherby Bulldogs.\nTeam line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nThe league was won by Crawley Jets who defeated Rotherham Giants in the final.\n2001.\nThe Conference expanded into Wales for the first time in 2001 when Cardiff Demons, who had formerly run a young team in the Academy competition, joined the league. Along with the new North East Division this left the Rugby League Conference with 30 teams in the 2001 season.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nHowever, Gateshead Panthers merged into Newcastle Knights before the season started leaving a gap in the North East Division which was filled by Durham Phoenix, who after this one season returned to their former name of Durham Tigers.\nTeesside beat Coventry Bears by a narrow margin in the grand final at Webb Ellis Road, Rugby.\n2002.\nThe competition for the first time remained at the same number of teams in the 2002 season, the only change being the addition of Luton Vipers from the London League to replace South Norfolk Saints who took a year out into that same competition. Plans to expand to Scotland with a Glasgow team in 2002 on the Cardiff model failed to materialise, and the Conference had to wait until 2007 to have Scottish full members for the first time. Another plan to expand to 32 teams with the addition of teams based in Bolton and Telford also fell through with Telford withdrawing their application.\nThis season saw a controversial format change, with two sets of three second round groups, both for the top three teams in each group but also for the bottom teams. These provided four extra fixtures, giving 14 guaranteed games, but the extra fixtures were poorly scheduled, seeing Manchester Knights eliminated despite winning all four extra games. This format was ditched after this season, though the idea of tiered competition was to return with the advent of premier divisions.\nTeam line-ups as follows (new club in italics):\nIn 2002 London Skolars were accepted into National League Two, from the following season the first club in over fifty years to make the transition from the amateur ranks to the professional leagues (the previous club to do so being Cardiff who unsuccessfully had stepped up from the Welsh League in 1951) and the first to step up successfully from a non-league competition since Castleford's elevation from the Yorkshire Senior League in 1926 (from which league Featherstone Rovers had also successfully stepped up a few years previously), though this league was theoretically semi-professional.\nIn September, last year's losing finalist Coventry Bears beat Hemel Stags in the grand final held at Cheltenham.\n2003.\nHemel Stags, St Albans Centurions, Coventry Bears, Manchester Knights, South London Storm (their position initially given to Crawley Jets, who later turned it down) and Teesside Steelers joined the newly formed National League Three in 2003, where they were joined by BARLA clubs Woolston Rovers (Warrington), Bradford Dudley Hill, Sheffield Hillsborough Hawks and Huddersfield Underbank Rangers. The inaugural winners were Woolston Rovers (Warrington) who defeated surprise finalists Teesside Steelers in the final.\nThe conference made the leap from 30 to 52 teams with the main growth areas being Wales and the North West of England, both of which gained their own division for the first time, but also in the South East with the addition of no fewer than 5 teams from the London League (North London Skolars 'A', South London Storm 'A', Greenwich Admirals, St Ives Roosters and the returning South Norfolk Saints). Also for the first time two teams further southwest than Gloucester participated: the Bristol Sonics and Somerset Vikings.\nThis rapid expansion was in part possible due to the lowering of the strict minimum criteria which were considered less necessary due to National League Three allowing a higher standard of play for the teams more suited to it. However, despite this, the only team to fail to complete the season was founder member Bedford Swifts. More controversial at the time was the inclusion in a development competition of Leeds Akademiks, a team based on the student old boys model very successfully used by the North London Skolars, in the largely rugby league free northern part of Leeds, but still nonetheless in a city known for rugby league. This was to pave the way for a huge influx of truly heartland teams the following season, drastically changing the face of the competition.\nTeam line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nBedford Swifts failed to complete the season.\nBridgend Blue Bulls won the 2003 title defeating Carlisle Centurions in the final.\n2004.\nThe 2004 season saw Birmingham Bulldogs, Carlisle Centurions, Gateshead Storm (late replacements after Teesside Steelers surprisingly announced they were folding after being runners-up the previous season) and Essex Eels leave the Conference to join National League Three, which also gained the reformed Bramley Buffaloes. National league three was won by expansion club Coventry Bears, whose team featured professional rugby union players from Coventry RFC and Australian semi-pros including National Rugby League (NRL) reserve graders. They defeated Woolston Rovers (Warrington) 48–24 at Widnes Vikings' Halton Stadium, the first time the NL3 final had been held on the same bill as the other National League finals.\nThis season saw major expansion in the heartlands resulting in new Yorkshire and Cumbria divisions. The decision to include them has been much criticised, especially since many (though by no means all) are uncommitted to summer rugby league, seeing British Amateur Rugby League Association as their priority. However, only through the inclusion of heartland teams was it possible to create some of the premier divisions the following season, and a few of the heartland clubs were needed by National League Three over the years to keep it going when teams resigned from it. Furthermore, allowing heartland teams in meant all National League Three teams could run a reserve team in the summer if they so chose\nUnlike the previous season only one team (St Albans Centurions 'A') was admitted from the London ARL.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nThe start of the season was marred by the withdrawal of twice former champions Crawley Jets, whose proposed replacements Reigate Crusaders never materialised. The only team to withdraw mid-season was Carlisle Centurions 'A', the last time this number was so few.\nNew team Widnes Saints defeated West London Sharks in the final.\n2005.\nIn 2005 National League Three changed from a period of expansion to one of consolidation, with both Manchester Knights (who had failed to complete their last few games the previous season) and South London Storm both deciding to enter the new Premier Divisions, though in fact Manchester Knights would only last two games before folding, with their position taken over by former BARLA club Dewsbury Celtic who saw summer as their future. In fact the National League Three season saw both Carlisle Centurions and Birmingham Bulldogs fail to complete the season (Birmingham took over their reserve teams' fixtures) showing that the expansionist bubble had seemingly burst with Bradford Dudley Hill defeating Bramley Buffaloes in an all-heartland final and both Coventry Bears and Essex Eels resigning at the end of the season.\nThe RLC Premier divisions were set up in 2005 to include the stronger teams in those areas who were able to travel further to play away games. The North and Central divisions were largely dominated by heartland teams that had been part of the influx the previous two seasons, the former of which incorporated all remaining Cumbrian division teams, while the Welsh Premier Division was the same teams as the regional division en masse promoted in status for pragmatic reasons. The South Premier offered the best hope for expanding rugby league into new areas.\nNew teams Redditch Ravens and Scarborough Pirates were formed from the ashes of the Worcestershire Saints and Yorkshire Coast Tigers clubs respectively. Leeds Akademiks had to change their moniker to the Akkies due to a legal challenge from an American clothing brand named Akademik. The ever fruitful London League provided three more teams this year: Bedford Tigers (formed the previous year from the ashes of Bedford Swifts), Haringey Hornets (effectively London Skolars' third team) and Luton Vipers 'A'.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nIt was felt that this season saw too many unstable teams admitted to make up the gaps left by teams joining the Premier Division. This was supported by the unprecedented number of midseason withdrawals, though a couple of these were more due to the increasing standards created by the influx of heartland teams. Aside from the aforementioned NL3 withdrawals and Manchester's replacement by Dewsbury Celtic in the Premier Division there were many Regional Division withdrawals. This started with the pre-season withdrawal of Lancaster (replaced by Rochdale Spotland Rangers), Chester Wolves (replaced by Wigan &amp; Leigh Cavaliers), Rugby Raiders and Thames Valley. This continued with mid-season withdrawals of Oxford Cavaliers (who were to return), Luton Vipers 'A', Middlesex Lions, Gosport &amp; Fareham Vikings and most surprisingly Rotherham Giants.\nThe Premier divisions saw Bridgend Blue Bulls defeat Leeds Akkies in the final, while Wetherby Bulldogs defeated Gloucestershire Warriors in the regional final.\n2006.\nThe 2006 season saw Coventry Bears and Essex Eels return to the RLC structure in the Midlands and Premier South Divisions respectively. Their NL3 places were taken by the promoted Dewsbury Celtic and Featherstone Lions, who had recently resigned from the BARLA National Conference League. Though Sheffield Hillsborough Hawks soon resigned from NL3 leaving their reserves as their first team.\nThe Premier divisions saw a change in boundaries leaving the North Premier division covering a larger area to give the English Midlands clubs their own premier division without having to face heartland teams, though this left the West Midlands division with too few teams to run, forcing it into a merger with the South West division. The Welsh premier division was split into two divisions, though this decision was reversed for the following season.\nThe London League provided three more clubs in Broadstairs Bulldogs, Kent Ravens and Colchester Romans. Two further relocations were Bolton Le Moors moving to Darwen to become East Lancashire Lions and Hull Phoenix moving to Cottingham. Furthermore, London Skolars 'A' had a one-season rebrand as Haringey Hornets, leaving the regional team of that name to become their reserves. The new Chester Wolves team were unconnected to the former team and in fact a summer team for Widnes-based BARLA club West Bank Bears.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nAs with the previous season there were many drop-outs with Winlaton Vulcans (replaced by Gateshead Storm 'A'), Pembrokeshire Panthers and Northampton failing to make the starting gate and West Cumbria Crusaders, Huddersfield Sharks, Luton Vipers, Essex Eels, Catterick Panthers and Mansfield Storm subsequently resigned. Also while they withdrew before the fixtures were finalised South Wakefield Sharks were expected to play in the North Midlands &amp; South Yorkshire division. Furthermore, Haringey Hornets 'A' were allowed to remain in the competition despite scratching 7 out of their 10 fixtures. However, unlike the previous season the withdrawals were less to do with unsuitable teams being let into the regionals and more to do with regional division standard teams being forced into the premier divisions to make up the numbers there.\nThe 2006 Premier division saw South London defeat East Lancashire in the final, while Liverpool beat Thorne Moor in the regionals final.\nIn 2006 a new league was founded as a feeder league to the RLC in the Midlands and South Yorkshire. The Midlands RL Merit League (now known as RL Merit League) was based on the principles of the successful London League and consisted of new clubs who are not ready for the full commitment of the Conference season together with RLC clubs' 'A' teams.\nThe Rugby League Conference provided administrative and promotional support to the Scottish Conference as a pilot scheme with a view to integrating the Scottish league as a full part of the Conference for the 2007 season. The six teams being Glasgow Bulls, Easterhouse Panthers, Paisley Hurricanes, Edinburgh Eagles, Fife Lions and Moray Eels.\nGloucestershire Warriors became the first Conference side to beat a 'traditional' amateur side when they beat Pennine League team Illingworth 25–24 away from home in the 2006 Challenge Cup. South London Storm were crowned RLC National Champions after beating East Lancashire Lions 30–0 in the final at Broadstreet RUFC.\n2007.\nThe 2007 season also saw a new sponsor for the league with Totalrlc being replaced by United Co-operatives in a six figure deal. Following United's merger with the larger The Co-operative Group, the league was named the Co-operative Rugby League Conference for sponsorship purposes.\nIn 2007, Bradford Dudley Hill withdrew from National League Three to return to the National Conference League and St Albans Centurions decided to join the RLC Premier South. Hemel Stags were left as the only southern team and National League Three was absorbed into the Rugby League Conference as the Rugby League Conference National Division with the addition of three teams from the Premier North Division: Leeds Akkies, Cottingham Phoenix and East Lancashire Lions. Cottingham Phoenix were subsequently expelled about halfway through the season for forfeiting three fixtures. The inaugural RLC National Division was won by Featherstone Lions who defeated Bramley Buffaloes in the final.\nThe promotion of three teams to the RLC National left the already depleted Premier North unviable and an artificial North Premier was created out of the North East and North regional divisions so that a league of this name could still exist.\nThe Midlands Premier Division gained Gloucestershire and Somerset in place of struggling Wolverhampton, who returned to the regionals. This season was a new South West division created for teams from the deep South West. While this was rather artificially created it was necessary due to the unique circumstances of the region to reduce travelling costs for what are ultimately amateur clubs. There was also already local interest for more teams, but intervention was needed to make sure this was a full division.\nFor the first time in several years no London League teams were promoted, but Farnborough Falcons and London Griffins had intended to enter before receiving call-ups (to form the short lived South Division intended to replace the failed South East division) and still played a small number of fixtures in it. The Midlands Merit League produced new club South Humber Rabbitohs and also helped provide Scunthorpe Barbarians partly based on former MML club Scunthorpe Braves. Aberavon Fighting Irish rebranded as Neath Port Talbot Steelers and South Norfolk Saints as Thetford Titans. Worksop Sharks relocated to Rossington, Doncaster controversially as Doncaster already had a team - Thorne Moor Marauders and this broke the one club, one town policy theoretically in place. Thorne Moor Marauders merged with BARLA club Moorends to become the Moorends &amp; Thorne Marauders.\nThe Scottish affiliated division of 2006 became a full member division with all six teams admitted, though Glasgow never completed the season.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nBroadstairs Bulldogs failed to start the season and were replaced by London Griffins. Cottingham Phoenix, Gateshead Storm 'A', Ormskirk Heelers, North Wales Coasters and Glasgow Bulls all failed to complete the season, which while less than in the previous two seasons was still far from ideal, especially in the North West and Cheshire divisions which were both left with just four teams.\nThe Premier division was won by St Albans Centurions who defeated Coventry Bears in the final. The Regional division was won by Widnes Saints who defeated Bedford Tigers in the final.\n2008.\nThe RLC National in 2008 saw Leeds Akkies drop to the Premier North but the addition of a Colts team to professional club Crusaders and the double promotion of Liverpool Buccaneers to the National Division. Also notably for the first time no RLC National clubs ran a reserve team in the RLC, in fact Hemel were the only club to run one at all, in the London League.\nThere were multiple rebrandings: Crewe Wolves became Lymm Wolves, Winnington Park became Northwich Stags, the returning North Wales Coasters became Rhyl Coasters, Kingston Warriors became Elmbridge and Gosport &amp; Fareham Vikings became Portsmouth Navy Seahawks.\nThe Midlands Merit League, renamed RL Merit League this season, produced East Riding and Sheffield Forgers for the Conference but South Humber Rabbitohs stepped back down. The London League provided Northampton Casuals and Hainault Bulldogs but regained London Griffins and Farnborough Falcons with the scrapping of the unviable South Division. 2008 also the saw the creation of the \nWomen's Rugby League Conference.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nGlasgow Bulls, Manchester Jets and Macclesfield Titans all failed to start the season, with Kent Ravens having their fixtures stopped after one game, joined the London League. Established club Durham Tigers failed to complete the season in the North East division. Also while they withdrew before the fixtures were finalised Copeland Athletic were expected to play in the North West division.\n2009.\nThe North Premier Division was scrapped replaced by two new Premiers; the North West Premier and the Yorkshire Premier though the bulk of its membership joined the newly reformed North East Division. The heartland winter league the National Conference League launched a series of Summer Divisions in 2009 similar to the Conference.\nThe National Division lost Celtic Crusaders Colts to the Super League Reserve Grade but regained Carlisle Centurions from the North Premier Division and gained Nottingham Outlaws from the Midlands Premier Division\nWest Wales Sharks relocated and became Dinefwr Sharks. Thetford Titans moved to Bury St Edmunds and became Bury Titans. The North East saw established club Durham Tigers fail to return, but saw the return of rugby league to Winlaton in the name of Winlanton Warriors (Winlaton had previously not only had its own team in 2005 but had also hosted Gateshead Storm and Whitley Bay Barbarians). Victoria Knights were formed from the ashes of Paisley Hurricanes though could barely raise a team.\nNottingham Outlaws A, Moorends-Thorne Marauders A and Wigan Riversiders joined the Rugby League Conference from the RL Merit League. The Midlands Rugby League was formed out of the RL Merit League giving the Conference a new feeder competition with the RL Merit League being split into North West and Yorkshire divisions. Norwich City Saxons, Hainault Bulldogs 'A', Kent Ravens, Farnborough Falcons and Southampton Spitfires all moved up from the London ARL, this influx of new teams allowing the re-separation of the two Regional divisions in the South East (East and London &amp; South).\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nBridlington Bulls failed to start the season in the Yorkshire Premier division. Guildford Giants replaced Farnborough Falcons in the London &amp; South division. Kent Ravens failed to complete the season in the London &amp; South division. Moorends &amp; Thorne Marauders 'A' failed to start the season in the North Midlands Division and were replaced by Parkside Hawks. Redditch Ravens failed to complete the season in the Midlands Premier Division and entered the Midlands Merit League. Telford Raiders also failed to complete the season in the Midlands Premier Division. However, their results stood. Cambridge Eagles and Hainault Bulldogs 'A' failed to complete the season in the Eastern Division. Plymouth Titans failed to complete the season in the South West division, but the results stood. Hartlepool failed to complete the season in the North East but the results stood.\n2010.\n2010 saw an expansion in the numbers of divisions with the Midlands, Wales and North West all forming new regional divisions. The North Midlands division formed the basis for the new Yorkshire regional division.\nThese new divisions saw many teams step up from the merit leagues: Coventry Bears A, Birmingham Bulldogs A, North East Worcestershire Ravens (formerly Redditch Ravens) and Leamington Royals either joined or rejoined from the Midlands Rugby League; Chester Gladiators, Crewe &amp; Nantwich Steamers, Wigan Riversiders Eels, Mancunians RL, Victoria Rangers and Barnsley Broncos (formerly called Barnsley) stepped up from the RL Merit League and Hammersmith Hills Hoists, St Albans Centurions A, South London Storm A and Sussex Merlins moved up from the London League. The National Conference League failed to repeat its summer experiment leading three clubs: East Leeds, Milford Marlins and Shaw Cross Sharks to join the Rugby League Conference.\n2010 also saw an expansion of the Merit Leagues as the rump RL Merit League split into the Yorkshire &amp; Humber Merit League and the North West Merit League. A plan to form a North Wales League failed, but a five team 9s tournament was played.\nGateshead Storm and Newcastle Knights merged to form Newcastle Storm, Ipswich Rhinos and Colchester Romans merged to form Eastern Rhinos. Leicester Phoenix became Leicester Storm. Northampton Casuals became Northampton Demons.\nThis season had a much higher rate of teams dropping out or forfeiting games than usual with for example the North West Premier division losing three out of five initial teams and the Welsh Regional Division having four out of the original seven teams fail to play a game.\nThe inaugural Rugby League Conference Regional Championships took place at Derby's Haslams Lane ground, with six representative teams representing different English regions. The event was won by the Midlands.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nCarlisle Centurions withdrew from the National Division mid-season and their results were expunged, Liverpool Buccaneers withdrew from the National Division and their results stood.\nJordanhill Phoenix and Kirkcaldy failed to start the season in the Scottish division, Forth &amp; Clyde Nomads were brought in as replacements.\nRuncorn and Widnes Saints withdrew from the North West Premier Division pre-season to be replaced by Widnes West Bank and Wirral Warriors. New Broughton Rangers folded midseason in the North West Premier Division.\nHaworth Park failed to complete the season in the Yorkshire Premier Division but their results stood. \nBradford Salem withdrew from the Yorkshire Regional Division to be replaced by Shaw Cross Sharks. Wetherby Bulldogs and Scunthorpe Barbarians failed to complete the season in the Yorkshire Regional division but their results stood.\nDerby City withdrew mid-season from the Midlands Premier but their results stood. North East Worcestershire Ravens failed to complete the season in the Midlands Regional division but the results stood.\nBlackwood Bulldogs failed to complete the season in the Welsh Premier division. Amman Valley Rhinos, Dinefwr Sharks, Wildboars (St Clears) and Swansea-Llanelli Dragons were all excluded from the Welsh Regional division after not fulfilling any fixtures and replaced by Dyffryn Devils.\nSt Albans Centurions A withdrew from the East Regional division but their fixtures stood.\n2011.\n2011 saw the National Division regain Coventry Bears from the Midlands Premier Division and Valley Cougars step up from the Welsh Premier Division. Gateshead Lightning were admitted as well as a reserve team for Gateshead Thunder but failed to start the season.\n2011 also saw more new divisions with Scotland and North East gaining a Premier Division and a new Regional Division being formed in the West of England with clubs from various divisions to reduce the travel burden. The Midlands Premier and Regional Divisions merged with a split season format. Yorkshire replaced its Premier and Regional Divisions with two geographically split divisions (west and east) that would have premier and regional division playoffs.\nThe only clubs moving up from feeder leagues were Northampton Demons A and Bristol Sonics A from the Midlands Rugby League and East Lancashire Vikings from the North West Merit League. A new feeder league was created the Eastern Merit League which split off from the London League. The Yorkshire &amp; Humber Merit League split into a North division and a Midlands division.\nThe plans for 2012 saw several winter sides switching to summer with Cadishead Rhinos, Chorley Panthers and Rochdale Cobras joining the North West Regional division; Walton Warriors, Knottingley Rockware Stolze and Cutsyke Raiders in the Yorkshire East division and Doncaster Toll Bar, Guiseley Rangers and Lindley Swifts in the Yorkshire West (which also gained new side Prospect Pirates). There were also numerous BARLA clubs entering teams in the North West Merit League.\nNorthallerton Stallions moved to Catterick and became North Yorkshire Stallions. Newcastle Storm became Gateshead Storm. Newport Titans became Titans with a relocation to Machen.\nInitial line-ups as follows (new clubs in italics):\nGateshead Lightning failed to start the season in the National Division. Guiseley Rangers and East Leeds failed to start the season in the Yorkshire Premier (West). Doncaster Toll Bar failed to complete the season in the Yorkshire Premier Division (West) and their results stood. Moray Eels failed to start the season in the Scottish Premier division Falkirk failed to start the season in the Scottish 1st Division. Ayr Knights failed to complete the season in the Scottish 1st Division and their results stood. South Somerset Warriors failed to complete the season in the South West Division. CPC Bears failed to complete the season in the Welsh Premier and their results stood. Blackwood Bulldogs failed to start the season in the South Wales Championship. Hainault Bulldogs failed to complete the season in the Premier South division and had London Skolars A take over their fixtures midseason. Birmingham Bulldogs A failed to complete the season in the Midlands Division (East). Mancunians, Widnes West Bank and East Lancashire Vikings failed to complete the season in the North West Premier division and their results stood. Crewe &amp; Nantwich Steamers failed to complete the season in the North West Regional division and their results stood. Norwich City Knights and Northampton Demons A failed to complete the season in the East division and their results stood\n2012 and the future.\nThe RFL have released plans for a new structure in the summer game. Initial plans were for the Rugby League Conference to be scrapped and replaced with a Northern and Southern Conference at tier 4 to replace the National division (and the National Conference League that switched from winter). These plans were later amended to have three National Conference League divisions staying as they were underpinned by a separate division 4 based on the Rugby League Conference National division.\nTier 5 will consist of a series of regional leagues where Rugby League Conference clubs will be joined by some BARLA clubs switching to summer. These regional leagues will include the Yorkshire Men's League, North West Men's League and Midlands Rugby League and cover the length and breadth of the country."

In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, before a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play, although, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched.\nTy Cobb was the first player to reach 3,000 games played. Cobb's record of 3,035 games played lasted for 46 seasons until Hank Aaron would break the record. Aaron's record was subsequently broken by Carl Yastrzemski in 1983 and finally broken the following season by Pete Rose, who currently holds the record for most games played at 3,562.

The fearsome bowling of the tall fast bowler Wilson created havoc in the local camp.\nAt Faridpur, in the first innings the MCC batting collapsed badly against the medium pace of Obaidul Haq Azam. His 7/18 was the best bowling by a Bangladeshi bowler at the time, breaking Syed Ashraful's record of 7/23 in the 1979 ICC Trophy against Fiji. Also, this match marked the international debut for Gazi Ashraf Lipu. He went to play a significant role in the development of Bangladesh cricket.\nThe Chittagong match was abandoned early on the 2nd day due to bad weather.\nThe infamous weather of Chittagong intervened to spoil the match. Raquibul Hasan was specially unlucky, as he looked set for his first hundred in Bangladeshi colours.\nThe drawn match at Rajshahi was dominated by the spinners of both the sides. The slow turning pitch made strokeplay extremely difficult. The Bangladeshi top order batting collapsed against the spin of Dermott Monteith on the 1st day. But the lower order, led by captain Hira and ever reliable Jahangir Shah fought back. Off spinner, Anwarul Amin Azhar showed class during the MCC innings. Only the veteran, Jameson, on his 2nd tour of Bangladesh could handle him properly. Azhar is widely regarded as the best Bangladeshi spinner of the decade. The Bangladesh batting collapsed again in the 2nd innings, but young Mujibul Haq stood firm to save the match.\nRaquibul Hasan scored half centuries in each innings at Dhaka. He got good support from the opener Yousuf Babu in the 2nd innings. But the match belonged to Mark Nicholas. Batting at number three, the Hampshire batsman amassed the first century by an MCC player against Bangladesh.\nThe only match to produce a result was the one-day match where the inexperience of the local players in the shorter version of the game was exposed.\nThese matches saw the emergence of a number of talented youngsters in Bangladesh cricket, like Gazi Ashraf Lipu, Rafiqul Alam, Mujibul Haq, Nehal Hasnain, Obiadul Haq Azam, Nadir Shah, and Manjur Ahmed Manju. While some of them failed to live up to the expectations, Lipu, Rafiq &amp; Nehal went on to play vital role in Bangladesh cricket throughout the 80s."

        "title": "2008 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "These are the profiles for the individual stages in the 2008 Tour de France, with Stage 1 on 5 July, and Stage 11 on 16 July.\nStages.\nStage 1.\nFor the first time since 1967, the tour started with a road stage rather than the traditional prologue. The stage was hilly with four fourth category climbs through the Monts d'Arrée in the department of Finistère. The finish at Plumelec is uphill on the \"Côte de Cadoual\", with a 1.7 km climb at 6.2%. As there were no time bonuses in the three intermediate sprints, the first rider home wore the yellow jersey at the start of stage 2.\nAn eight-man breakaway formed at the 3 km mark, and it got away for some time. At the first feeding station, Hervé Duclos-Lassalle crashed and sustained a broken left wrist, becoming the first rider to have to abandon the 2008 Tour. At about the 30 km to go mark, two in the break, Lilian Jégou and David de la Fuente got away from the other six after a short series of attacks and counter-attacks. The peloton, paced by Silence–Lotto, increased pace when the other six rejoined them, and Jegou and de la Fuente were caught at around the 7 km to go mark. At that point, the peloton split into several groups for the run in toward the finish, won by Alejandro Valverde. One of the pre-race favourites, Mauricio Soler, fell with 20 km remaining and lost more than three minutes.\nStage 1 result and general classification after stage 1\nStage 2.\nThe second stage was another hilly stage, with three fourth category climbs and the third category \"wall\" at Mûr-de-Bretagne.\nSylvain Chavanel and Thomas Voeckler established a breakaway at the first categorized climb, reaching a maximum advantage of 6'25\" before being joined by Agritubel teammates Christophe Moreau and David Lelay with 57 km remaining. The four Frenchmen were caught by the peloton in the final 2 km, and the sprint was won by Thor Hushovd.\nStage 3.\nStage 3 was flat, with no ranking climbs, which was expected to favour the sprinters at the finish alongside the River Loire in Nantes.\nA four-man breakaway formed at the 9 km mark, comprising William Frischkorn, Samuel Dumoulin, Paolo Longo Borghini, and Romain Feillu. They quickly took the three intermediate sprints available on the course and had a maximum advantage of 14 minutes before the peloton began to reel them in. Several teams helped with the workload to bring the breakaway back. With the day's early rain saturating the road, Fabian Wegmann crashed around 60 km in, needing to change his bike minutes later.\nFor many kilometers, the time gap didn't decrease beyond about 6'30\" to 6'45\", leading to speculation that the four in the breakaway could survive to the line. The teams of the prominent sprinters came forward to make a faster pace at around 35 km to go. With about 23 km to go, Ángel Gómez and Nicki Sørensen were involved in a crash that split the peloton into three fragments, the second of which contained the white jersey Riccardo Riccò and Denis Menchov, finished 38 seconds behind the first, which contained the yellow jersey Alejandro Valverde. The third group contained Christophe Moreau. Gómez eventually had to abandon the Tour.\nThe breakaway survived to the finish, giving the Tour a new maillot jaune for the next day's individual time trial. Dumoulin won the sprint to the line.\nStage 4.\nThe fourth stage was an individual time trial over a flat course to the west of Cholet in the department of Maine-et-Loire.\nDenis Menchov and Jens Voigt set nearly identical times about two-thirds of the way into the time trial, with Menchov one second better. It stood as best until reigning world time trial champion and stage favorite Fabian Cancellara gained a one-second advantage, despite having been behind Menchov's and Voigt's pace at both intermediate time checks. The surprise of the day came when Stefan Schumacher beat Cancellara by 33 seconds, having similar leads at each time check. Cadel Evans, David Millar, and Kim Kirchen also beat Cancellara, but could not match Schumacher.\nAs was expected, the top three men in the GC, having been in a breakaway almost the entire previous day, fell in the overall standings after the time trial, and the Tour had its third different rider in yellow at the day's end.\nStage 5.\nThis was the longest stage of the 2008 tour, over flat roads in the departments of Maine-et-Loire, Deux-Sèvres, Vienne, Indre-et-Loire and Indre.\nMauricio Soler fell in the neutral zone before the start; already suffering injuries from a fall on the opening day, the Colombian who won the polka-dot jersey last year finally succumbed and retired from the race at the 11 km mark of stage five.\nThe stage was led almost from start to finish by three breakaway riders. The French trio of Lilian Jégou, Florent Brard and national champion Nicolas Vogondy opened up a gap of more than eight minutes, which was slowly whittled away by the chasing peloton. Vogondy broke away from his compatriots in the final 1.5 km, only to be overhauled by the sprinters around 30 metres from the line.\nMark Cavendish, who was led out by his German team-mate Gerald Ciolek, held off late attacks from Thor Hushovd, Óscar Freire and Erik Zabel, and pulled away from his rivals in the final metres to claim glory after almost five-and-a-half hours in the saddle. This was his first of a record34 stage wins for Cavendish in the Tour de France.\nStage 6.\nThis was the first mountain stage of the tour through the Massif Central, with two Fourth Category climbs in the first half of the race before the riders crossed the Second Category Col de la Croix-Morand after 158 km. The finish is at the ski station of Super Besse on the slopes of Puy de Sancy with a climb of 11 km at an average gradient of 4.7%, including the final 1.5 km with a maximum gradient of 10%.\nA three-man breakaway, made up of Frenchmen Sylvain Chavanel, Benoît Vaugrenard and Freddy Bichot, claimed the sprints and the two small category 4 climbs early on in the stage. The group attained a maximum lead of 5'15\" after 95 km. The main field split on the climb of the Col de la Croix-Morand, with many of the sprinters and leadout men fell back into an \"autobus\", and many short-lived attempts to catch the two remaining riders from the breakaway, Vaugrenard having been dropped.\nChavanel and Bichot survived to the top of the Col de la Croix-Morand, giving Chavanel sufficient points on the day's climbs to gain the lead in the King of the Mountains classification, but he was caught with 20m remaining, and Bichot 7 km later. The autobus rejoined the second peloton on the descent from the Col de la Croix-Morand, before the field split into several small groups again. Riders who posed no threat to the GC attacked on the way up to Super-Besse, and the yellow jersey group, still being paced by Caisse d'Epargne, let them all go. Even when Christian Vande Velde, sixth overall and a member of the first place team Garmin–Chipotle, launched an attack, Caisse d'Epargne did not respond.\nFinally, at the 1 kilometer to go mark, the peloton came forward to bring back those who had broken away. Virtually all of the GC contenders were at the front of the main group. The last of Valverde's teammates peeled off to open the sprint to the line, won by Riccardo Riccò. In seeking a position for the final sprint, the yellow jersey wearer Stefan Schumacher caught the wheel of Kim Kirchen with 300m remaining, and fell. Since the finish was on an uphill climb, the rule giving anyone who crashes in the final 3 kilometers the same time as the group they were in upon crashing was not invoked, and he lost 32\" on the stage, and Kirchen took the overall lead.\nStage 7.\nThis is a short stage along the steep roads of the Massif Central, through the Monts du Cantal with the third category Côte de Fraisse coming after only 11 km. After a fourth category climb came a pair of Category Two climbs: the Col d'Entremont after 101 km, and the Pas de Peyrol, before descending to Aurillac via another fourth category climb.\nEarly crosswinds split the peloton. Damiano Cunego crashed after about 50 km and although he rejoined the leading group, he missed a later break, losing 33 seconds on the day. A breakaway made up of Josep Jufré, Luis León Sánchez, David de la Fuente and Vincenzo Nibali formed on the way up the Col d'Entremont and were caught by a group of nineteen, including most of the overall favourites, with about 9 km remaining, but Sánchez counterattacked on the descent and held on to win the stage.\nDe la Fuente's three leads over the tops of climbs earned him the lead in the King of the Mountains classification, while four riders, including Agritubel team leader Christophe Moreau failed to finish and Magnus Bäckstedt finished outside regulation time.\nLiquigas rider Manuel Beltrán was revealed after this stage to have failed a blood doping test earlier in the tour, and was withdrawn by his team.\nStage 8.\nThis was a connecting stage from the Massif Central to the Pyrenees and had four categorized climbs in the first half of the race before the finish in Toulouse.\nThe significant break of the day saw Laurent Lefèvre go clear on the second climb, and was followed by his Bouygues Télécom teammate Jérôme Pineau, Amets Txurruka, and Christophe Riblon. Eventually Lefevre allowed the other three to join him, and the group attained a maximum advantage of 5' 15\" at 110 km, but pressure from sprinters' teams reduced the gap rapidly over the following 20 km, to less than three minutes. Riccardo Riccò was one of four fallers at 116 km, and after being assisted to catch up with the peloton, needed medical attention. With 13 km to go, Pineau and Txurruka moved clear of their colleagues in the break, who were absorbed into the peloton 3 km later. The pursuit of the peloton, which had eased up to avoid regrouping too soon and allow other attacks, put on pressure again in the last 20 km, finally catching the two escapees with 3.5 km left. In a bunched sprint, Mark Cavendish gained his second stage victory.\nStage 9.\nThis stage took the riders into the Pyrenees with a series of fourth category climbs in the early stages before the third category Col des Ares at the 100 km mark. After passing through Bagnères-de-Luchon, the riders climbed the First Category Col de Peyresourde before the final climb over the Col d'Aspin, after which came a 26 km descent to the finish at Bagnères-de-Bigorre.\nAleksandr Kuschynski, Nicolas Jalabert, and Sebastian Lang formed a breakaway after 22 km that claimed the intermediate sprint and first few small climbs. They attained a maximum advantage of 14' 20\" at 55 km before the peloton, being paced by Euskaltel–Euskadi, started bringing them back. Cadel Evans crashed after about 105 km, injuring his left elbow and needing to ride with torn clothing the rest of the stage. He had to change bikes and was paced back into the peloton by the rest of his Silence–Lotto team. He, and subsequently Alejandro Valverde, needed to seek medical attention.\nThe leaders' advantage, after staying at around ten minutes for many kilometers, began to fall on the ascent of the Col de Peyresourde, and first Jalabert, then Kuschynski, dropped off Lang's pace. Maxime Monfort and King of the Mountains leader David de la Fuente moved ahead of the peloton before the first major mountain pass of the tour.\nAfter consolidating on the descent from the Peyresourde, the peloton thinned and split again on the way up the Col d'Aspin. The main GC contenders came to the front of the peloton as it neared the summit, and only Lang of the early escapees remained clear. After several other riders attempted unsuccessfully to do so, Luis León Sánchez bridged the gap to Monfort and de la Fuente, only for the latter to drop away. The decisive attack of the stage came from Riccardo Riccò, who rapidly passed the four riders ahead of the peloton and crossed the top of the Col d'Aspin 1' 15\" ahead of the yellow jersey group he had left 4 km earlier.\nRiccò preserved that margin on the descent to win the stage, with only Vladimir Efimkin moving clear of the peloton on the descent, to claim second position on the road. \nStage 10.\nThis stage was selected for the 2008 L'Étape du Tour run on Sunday 6 July when nearly 7,500 amateur and club cyclists raced over the route, with Laurent Four coming home in the fastest time of 5 hours 38 minutes.\nThe highlight of this short, intense stage is the Hors catégorie climb over the Col du Tourmalet at 2115 m, with the finish at the ski-station at Hautacam. The final climb is 14.4 km, with an average gradient of 7.2%, with the steepest section at 10%.\nTwenty-four riders representing seventeen teams broke away from the peloton almost immediately. Included in the group were three riders each for Gerolsteiner and Bouygues Télécom as well as the green and polka-dot jersey wearers Óscar Freire and David de la Fuente. Only Milram, Lampre, and Garmin–Chipotle were unrepresented. Freire took the first intermediate sprint and with it the outright lead in the points classification.\nSeven of the twenty-four came clear on the way up the Côte de Loucrup. Freire was among them and took the second sprint to cement his lead. The leaders' time gap grew to over nine minutes before the peloton thinned as chases came forward to bring them back. Rémy Di Gregorio attacked and got free of the group of seven, going it alone to be the first over the Tourmalet.\nJens Voigt and Team CSC Saxo Bank set a blistering pace up the Tourmalet in the peloton, with the intention of knocking off as many teammates of the overall contenders as they could while protecting Carlos Sastre. Several team leaders, including Alejandro Valverde, eventually dropped as well. Di Gregorio at last was caught by the yellow jersey's group of contenders at the 12 kilometers to go mark. The contenders traded attacks on the way up to Hautacam, and the yellow jersey himself Kim Kirchen was dropped along the way. Fränk Schleck, Juan José Cobo, and Leonardo Piepoli came forward and gained a maximum advantage of two minutes on the other contenders. The Saunier Duval riders went on to drop Schleck, and the time gap between Schleck and Cadel Evans was very close to see who would wear yellow at the day's end.\nStage 11.\nStage 11 was a relatively straightforward ride through the foothills of the Pyrenees, with one first category climb over the Col de Portel at the 110 km mark, and two third category climbs.\nBefore the stage began, Moisés Dueñas was revealed to have failed a test for evidence of blood-doping at the end of stage 4, and was withdrawn by his team. Two more Barloworld riders withdrew injured during the stage, Félix Cárdenas and Paolo Longo Borghini. After 35 km, a 13-man breakaway, initiated by Fabian Wegmann and Kurt Asle Arvesen, formed, and with no rider within 20 minutes of the lead, came under no pressure from the main peloton. Gert Steegmans was dropped from this group on the first climb, but the rest of the breakaway increased their margin over the peloton. On the ascent of the Col de Portel, Amaël Moinard moved clear of the other escapees, and reached the top of the climb almost 2 minutes ahead of the rest of the group, while Óscar Pereiro moved ahead of the peloton, prompting a response by the CSC Saxo Bank team, and a split in the main field, but not isolating any GC contenders. Pereiro was re-integrated into the peloton with about 20 km remaining, while at the front of the race, Martin Elmiger and Arvesen attacked with 4 km left, shortly before Moinard was caught by the chasing group. They were joined by Alessandro Ballan, and briefly by Koos Moerenhout, and in the final 200m Arvesen started the sprint, hanging on to win the stage in a photo-finish. The main peloton, including all the main contenders, finished over 14 minutes behind, but leading standings were unaffected by the day's events."

        "text": "These are the profiles for the individual stages in the 2008 Tour de France, with Stage 12 on 17 July, and Stage 21 on 27 July.\nStages.\nStage 12.\nThis stage featured one fourth category climb over the Col du Camperié east of Axat after 111 km, before a long rapid descent to Narbonne, which was expected to give the sprinters the chance to demonstrate their skills.\nThe day began with news of the withdrawal from the Tour of the Saunier Duval–Scott team after their leader Riccardo Riccò, who was top of both the King of the Mountains and Young Riders' categories, had failed a blood test taken at the end of Stage 4.\nAt the 40 kilometer mark, Samuel Dumoulin and Arnaud Gérard broke away, and attained a maximum advantage of 4 minutes. Juan José Oroz joined them at the 113 kilometer mark. The peloton didn't let them get very much of a lead, keeping the time gap at around a minute and a half for most of the race, until the catch occurred with about 9 kilometers to go. A bunched sprint saw Mark Cavendish win his third stage this tour.\nStage 13.\nA series of fourth category climbs took the riders through Languedoc, before the run into Nîmes on this transitional stage before the riders move into the Alps.\nThis stage was remarkably similar to the one from the day before. An early breakaway, by Niki Terpstra and Florent Brard led almost the entire day until being caught in the final 10 kilometers. Another bunched sprint saw Mark Cavendish win yet again, but beyond that, eight of the top ten placed riders were the same both days, with three (including Cavendish) in the same exact position. Cavendish became the first sprinter to win four stages at a single Tour de France since Alessandro Petacchi did so in 2003, although Lance Armstrong won five of the last eight stages in the 2004 Tour de France including two individual time trials and three mountain stages.\nStage 14.\nThe race approached the Alps through the Vaucluse department crossing two fourth category climbs before dropping down to Digne-les-Bains.\nA break of 21 riders, with representatives from all but three of the teams, moved away after 5 km. Only four riders remained clear by the 41st kilometer; Bram Tankink, Sandy Casar, William Bonnet and José Iván Gutiérrez. They were eventually caught on the last climb, and on the descent there were many splits in the field. Of many attempted breaks on the descent towards the finish, Sylvain Chavanel came closest to success, but the stage again finished in a sprint. Cavendish had been dropped from the peloton on the climb, and points classification leader Óscar Freire won the sprint.\nStage 15.\nThe 15th stage was due to start at Digne-les-Bains but due to the risk of rock falls in the climb up the Col de Larche, the organisers decided to modify the itinerary. The stage started instead from Embrun and headed to Prato Nevoso, crossing into Italy via the climb over the hors catégorie Col Agnel (2,744 m). The finish at Prato Nevoso is rated First Category with an 11.4 km climb at an average of 6.9%.\nThe road conditions at the start in Embrun were terrible, with consistent rain soaking the road. After several attempts earlier, Egoi Martínez, José Luis Arrieta, Danny Pate, and Simon Gerrans broke away from the peloton at the 12 kilometer mark, just before the first intermediate sprint. The peloton was content to let them go up the Col Agnel well ahead, as their maximum advantage was almost fourteen minutes before the summit. When the peloton's relatively lax pace finally quickened, the autobus formed in back of it on the way up the Col Agnel. Martinez was the first over the top.\nThe peloton consolidated on the descent, but for an unusual reason – Robert Hunter and Óscar Pereiro clipped wheels and crashed, with Pereiro dramatically tumbling through a barricade from one section of the road down to a lower section. This happened at the front of the main group, and afterwards for several kilometers the peloton slowed nearly to the pace they'd had in the rain-soaked neutral zone. The time gap to the four leaders rose from eleven and a half to over seventeen minutes in this time. Pereiro broke his arm in the crash, and had to abandon. The field similarly slowed, affording more time to the breakaway, after a crash (which involved Christian Vande Velde, Damiano Cunego, Vincenzo Nibali, Sebastian Lang, and others) on both sides of a roundabout at the 60 kilometers to go mark. At that point, it was calculated that the peloton had no chance to catch the break, so the peloton stayed together, with the contenders poising to attack on the climb up to Prato Nevoso.\nTeam CSC Saxo Bank set a blistering pace on the way up the Colle del Morte and again up to Prato Nevoso, splitting the field and trying to isolate Cadel Evans. The yellow jersey group thinned to ten riders, including the top six in the GC, as the CSC domestiques dropped off. On the way up to Prato Nevoso, Martinez attacked the other leaders and Arrieta was dropped. The favorites traded attacks and split as well on the way up.\nGerrans won the sprint to the line. Bernhard Kohl, Carlos Sastre, Denis Menchov and Alejandro Valverde came clear of Evans' group on the way to the finish. Fränk Schleck came clear of Evans in the last 100m to claim the yellow jersey, with Kohl narrowly failing to have taken enough time out of them both.\nStage 16.\nThe race returned to France on this short stage, via the hors catégorie Col de la Lombarde and Col de la Bonette (the highest pass in Europe at over 2,800 m altitude), before a descent of more than 20 km.\nFive riders, Samuel Dumoulin, Christophe Le Mével, Sébastien Rosseler, and former classification leaders Stefan Schumacher and Thomas Voeckler came clear of the peloton after 42 kilometers. Twenty-four riders also came clear as a chase shortly thereafter, splitting the field well before the climb up the Col de la Lombarde began. Riders were dropped and attacked from the various groups and the field split into numerous fragments, until Schumacher was the only leader left. He stayed well clear of the trailing groups and actually gained time to be the first over the Lombarde. The others from the breakaway, aside from Schumacher, were eventually absorbed by the chases.\nThe field split even more on the way up the Col de la Bonette, to the point where it was difficult to call any particular group the peloton. Christian Vande Velde was the first GC contender to be dropped from the yellow jersey group, cracked by the pacemaking being done by Andy Schleck. A chase group paced by Cyril Dessel and Yaroslav Popovych caught Schumacher some 3 kilometers before the summit of the Bonette. John-Lee Augustyn, attacked from this group shortly before the summit and was the first to reach the top. He later skidded off the road and tumbled down a steep decline on the dirt beside it, losing his bike. He had no choice but to wait for a service car with a spare machine, and thus lost the chance to rejoin the leading group.\nThe leading group was whittled to four on the descent – Popovych, Dessel, David Arroyo and Sandy Casar. Denis Menchov was dropped from the yellow jersey group early on in the descent, and lost time. This brought Cadel Evans forward to make the pace in the yellow jersey group, to put as much time as possible between them and Menchov, since Menchov was likely Evans' biggest threat in the individual time trial that was to come and thus in all likelihood, for the Tour title itself. Popovych tried to open the sprint at just over 1 kilometer to go, but the others got him back. Dessel eventually took down the run to the line.\nStage 17.\nThis was the last stage before the race left the Alps, with three hors catégorie climbs of the Col du Galibier (2,645 m.), the Col de la Croix de Fer (2,067 m.) and the final climb up the Alpe d'Huez (1,850 m.).\nAt the very beginning of the day's racing a breakaway started, with Rémy Di Gregorio, Rubén Pérez and Peter Velits, joined later by Stefan Schumacher. With three major cols, the field inevitably became very fractured, but this group stayed clear of the main contenders for much of the day, with Schumacher first over the Galibier, and Velits taking the Croix de Fer. By the base of the Alpe d'Huez, only Velits and Jérôme Pineau were in front of the elite riders, whose group then numbered about 12. At the bottom of this final ascent of the day Carlos Sastre attacked twice, tagged by Menchov on the 1st go before eventually breaking clear. His fellow Team CSC Saxo Bank members in the group, Andy and Fränk Schleck worked to interrupt any counterattacks on the way up to Alpe d'Huez, and Sastre finished two minutes clear to claim yellow from the older Schleck brother, and establish a lead that he might be able to sustain in the time trial to follow.\nStage 18.\nThe race left the Alps and headed towards central France, with three rated climbs, including the second category Croix de Montvieux (811 m.) at 33 km from the finish.\nAt 30 kilometers in, Alexander Bocharov and Damiano Cunego crashed, with Cunego falling face-first into a road obstruction. He lay on the road for seven minutes before remounting his bike, falling ten minutes behind the peloton, with four teammates remaining with him for the rest of the stage. After 68 km, Carlos Barredo made a break, prompting a reaction from Marcus Burghardt and Christophe Le Mével. After 81 km, Burghardt caught up with Barredo, meanwhile, Mikel Astarloza and Romain Feillu joined Le Mével, about four minutes behind the leaders. These time gaps held up to the start of the Croix de Montvieux, at which point the breakaway appeared uncatchable.\nThe four main groups on the road continued up the final climb with time gaps remaining relatively unchanged. Barredo and Burghardt traded several attacks to the top of this climb and after it but Burghardt won a late, tense dash to the line. Feillu lead the next group home for third place, while an attack by Roman Kreuziger, an attempt to gain time on young rider classification leader Andy Schleck, resulted in a group of five riders including both Schleck and Kreuziger finishing some 20 seconds in front of the peloton. Cunego and his team-mates finished last, with Cunego dropping six places to twentieth in the general classification.\nStage 19.\nAfter two rated climbs in the first 42 km, this was an undulating route through the Allier department.\nA four-man group, made up of Stefan Schumacher, Egoi Martínez, Alessandro Ballan and Pierrick Fédrigo, moved away from the peloton after 16 km and led over the climbs, but never got more than 1 min 5 s clear, and by 69 km the group had been caught. Nine kilometers later, Sylvain Chavanel made an attack, and Jérémy Roy bridged the gap to join him. This pair stayed clear for the rest of the stage, with Chavanel thereby becoming the rider to have spent the greatest distance in this tour as part of a breakaway. The group's maximum advantage of over five minutes was reduced to a little over one by the end of the stage, in which Chavanel held off Roy's sprint to win. The bunched sprint for the minor positions was won by the tour's youngest rider, Gerald Ciolek, but green jersey leader Óscar Freire gained enough points to all but ensure victory in that competition. All the main contenders for Tour victory remained in the peloton all day.\nStage 20.\nThe second and final individual time trial followed rolling roads in the Allier and Cher departments.\nDespite the work he had done for his team in the Alps, two-time world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara had the legs to set the first true time to beat, nearly two minutes clear of early leader Sebastian Lang at the intermediate time checks and the finish. Stefan Schumacher, winner of the first time trial in the Tour, exactly tied Cancellara at the first time check and caught Sylwester Szmyd, who started two minutes before him, after only 18 kilometers. He came 14 seconds clear of Cancellara at the third time check and finished 21 seconds better than the world champion at the line.\nRoman Kreuziger took back over a minute from Andy Schleck in the race for the white jersey over the first two time checks, but missed winning the jersey at the end. Fränk Schleck seemed to be in poor form, losing considerable time as well as four places. Cadel Evans was unable to gain the time he needed on Carlos Sastre to regain yellow. Bernhard Kohl rode an unexpectedly good time trial, gaining slightly on Sastre and riding almost identically to Evans at the first two time checks, despite having fallen off the starthouse ramp before his ride began. Sastre was consistent and strong, riding one of his best ever time trials, catching Fränk Schleck and riding well enough to keep his yellow jersey for the ride to Paris.\nStage 21.\nThis was a hilly course to Paris winding through the Chevreuse Valley before the traditional loop on the Champs-Élysées, Place de la Concorde and the Rue de Rivoli. Once again, the strong men among the remaining sprinters fought it out for this prestigious stage win.\nIn keeping with tradition, the peloton took it easy on the way to the Champs-Élysées, with many riders taking time to smile for the cameras and enjoy some champagne courtesy of the team car of the victorious Team CSC Saxo Bank. Atop bicycles with new yellow handlebars, Team CSC led the field onto Champs-Élysées for the eight circuits over the famous cobblestone way. Beginning at the end of the first circuit, numerous riders tried to break away from the field, but none succeeded, and a classic bunched sprint saw Gert Steegmans win the race to the line. The field split in this final sprint, resulting in shifts of a few seconds in the final general classification."

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 12–14 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. There were 64 competitors from 55 nations.\nSummary.\nAlain Bernard stormed home on the final lap to claim France's first ever gold medal in the event with a time of 47.21. Australia's world record holder Eamon Sullivan enjoyed a great start in the first 50 metres, but ended up with a silver in 47.32, just 0.11 of a second behind Bernard. U.S. swimmer Jason Lezak and Brazil's César Cielo tied for the bronze medal in a matching time of 47.67.\nTwo-time defending champion Pieter van den Hoogenband finished the race in fifth place at 47.75. Although he missed an opportunity to attain a third straight triumph in the same event, Van den Hoogenband became the first ever swimmer to reach the final at his fourth Olympics. Four months later, he announced his retirement from the sport, ending an Olympic career with a total of seven medals, including three golds.\nVan den Hoogenband was followed in sixth by South Africa's Lyndon Ferns (48.04), and in seventh by Sullivan's teammate Matt Targett (48.20). After missing out the semifinals in Athens four years earlier, Sweden's Stefan Nystrand rounded out the finale to eighth place in 48.33.\nEarlier in the semifinals, Bernard and Sullivan exchanged world-record performances to set up a battle race for the final. Swimming in the first heat, Bernard delivered a time of 47.20 to erase a 0.04-second standard set by Sullivan during his lead-off leg in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay. A few minutes later, Sullivan had taken back the record in the second semifinal at 47.05. In addition, 2007 World Champions Brent Hayden and Filippo Magnini failed to advance to the final, despite swimming times faster than their World Championship-winning time.\nBackground.\nThis was the 25th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nFour of the eight finalists from the 2004 Games returned: two-time gold medalist Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, fourth-place finisher Ryk Neethling of South Africa, fifth-place finisher Filippo Magnini of Italy, and sixth-place finisher Duje Draganja of Croatia.\nWhile van den Hoogenband was the returning champion, the clear favorites in the event were Frenchman Alain Bernard and Australian Eamon Sullivan. Bernard had broken the Dutch swimmer's world record, with Sullivan coming within 0.02 seconds of Bernard's new record.\nArmenia, Aruba, the Cayman Islands, Kenya, and Serbia each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 24th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to two swimmers if both met the A qualifying standard, or one swimmer if he met the B standard. For 2008, the A standard was 49.23 seconds while the B standard was 50.95 seconds. The qualifying window was 15 March 2007 to 15 July 2008; only approved meets (generally international competitions and national Olympic trials) during that period could be used to meet the standards. There were also universality places available; if no male swimmer from a nation qualified in any event, the NOC could enter one male swimmer in an event.\nThe two swimmers per NOC limit had been in place since the 1984 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition consisted of three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The swimmers with the best 16 times in the heats advanced to the semifinals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties for advancement to the next round.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows:\nThe following records were set during this competition:\nSchedule.\nThe competition moved to a three-day schedule, rather than two days as in the past.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nBernard held the world record only briefly, setting it in the first semifinal heat before Sullivan broke it in the second heat."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 10–12 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. There were 58 competitors from 50 nations.\nAfter winning a bronze in Athens four years earlier, Michael Phelps blasted a new world record of 1:42.96 to claim his third straight gold, ninth career, and eleventh overall medal at the Olympics. South Korea's Park Tae-Hwan added a silver to his collection, following an unprecedented triumph in the 400 m freestyle two days earlier. He established a new Asian record of 1:44.85 to clear a 1:45 barrier, and used a final-lap split of 26.17 to edge out Phelps' teammate Peter Vanderkaay, who took home a bronze medal in a personal best of 1:45.14.\nSouth Africa's Jean Basson finished fourth with a time of 1:45.97, and was followed in the fifth spot by Germany's Paul Biedermann in 1:46.00. Switzerland's Dominik Meichtry, who raced to a top seed in the prelims, earned a sixth spot in 1:46.95, while Japan's Yoshihiro Okumura (1:47.14) and Great Britain's Robbie Renwick (1:47.47) rounded out the finale. Renwick missed out the semifinals by 0.01 of a second from the prelims, but was offered a second shot, following a sudden withdrawal of two swimmers. Canada's Brent Hayden and France's Amaury Leveaux later scratched the event to focus on their duty in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay.\nPhelps's gold medal was the first American victory in this event since Mark Spitz and Bruce Furniss went back-to-back in 1972 and 1976. Phelps was the fourth man to win multiple medals in the 200 metre freestyle. He and Vanderkaay were the first teammates to make the podium in the event together since West Germany had two medalists in 1984. Park's medal was South Korea's first in the men's 200 metre freestyle. Australia's three-Games medal streak in the event ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 2004 Games returned: bronze medalist Michael Phelps of the United States and eighth-place finisher Emiliano Brembilla of Italy. The bronze medal in this event, his weakest, had ended Phelps's attempt to break Mark Spitz's record of 7 gold medals in a single Games; this time, Phelps was the clear favourite in the event with two consecutive World Championships in the event between the 2004 and 2008 Games and no Ian Thorpe (retired) or Pieter van den Hoogenband (competing in the 100 metre freestyle) to contend with. The 2007 Worlds bronze medalist, Park Tae-hwan of South Korea (who had just won the 400 metre freestyle gold in Beijing), was a podium contender, as was Phelps's teammate Peter Vanderkaay.\nBrembilla was joined on the Italian team by 2000 bronze medalist Massimiliano Rosolino, returning after not competing in this event in 2004.\nCosta Rica, Estonia, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, and South Africa each made their debut in the event. Australia made its 13th appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to two swimmers if both met the A qualifying standard, or one swimmer if he met the B standard. For 2008, the A standard was 1:48.72 while the B standard was 1:52.53. The qualifying window was 15 March 2007 to 15 July 2008; only approved meets (generally international competitions and national Olympic trials) during that period could be used to meet the standards. There were also universality places available; if no male swimmer from a nation qualified in any event, the NOC could enter one male swimmer in an event.\nThe two swimmers per NOC limit had been in place since the 1984 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition followed the format established in 2000, with three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. The top 16 swimmers from the heats advanced to the semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition.\nSchedule.\nThe competition moved to a three-day schedule, rather than two days as in the past."

He denied Australia's Grant Hackett a third straight title in the event, touching the wall first in an African record of 14:40.84. Hanging with the leaders through the first two-thirds of the race, Mellouli moved into the lead at the 1,100-metre mark, and held off Hackett's sprinted finish on the final lap. This was also a retribution for Mellouli, who served an 18-month doping ban from FINA for using the banned stimulant Adderall.\nTrying to become the first male swimmer to win three gold medals in the same event, Hackett collected a silver in 14:41.53. Meanwhile, Canada's Ryan Cochrane powered home with a bronze in 14:42.69, finishing ahead of Russia's Yuri Prilukov (14:43.21).

        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 13–15 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. There were 40 competitors from 31 nations.\nBilled as the \"Clash of the Titans\", Ryan Lochte stormed home on the final lap to defeat his teammate Aaron Peirsol and claim his first individual Olympic gold medal. He touched the wall first in 1:53.94, faster than the world record he shared with Peirsol at 1:54.32. It was the fourth consecutive gold medal in the men's 200 backstroke for the United States, all by different swimmers.\nPeirsol enjoyed a head-to-head battle against Lochte in the first 150 metres, but ended up only with a silver in 1:54.33. This made Peirsol the first man to earn three medals in the 200 metre backstroke, adding to his silver in 2000 and gold in 2004. Russia's Arkady Vyatchanin added a second bronze to his collection (he had earlier finished third in the 100 metres backstroke), finishing in a new European record of 1:54.93 to hold off Austria's Markus Rogan (1:55.49), the silver medalist in Athens four years earlier. Earlier in the semifinals, Vyatchanin edged out Germany's Helge Meeuw in a swimoff to secure a last spot for the top 8 final. The medal was the first for Russia in the 200 metre backstroke, though Russian swimmers had earned medals for the Soviet Union and Unified Team in the event.\nJapan's Ryosuke Irie finished fifth with a time of 1:55.72, and was followed in the sixth spot by Australia's Hayden Stoeckel, who shared bronze medals with Vyatchanin in the 100 m backstroke, in an Oceanian record of 1:56.39. Romania's Răzvan Florea (1:56.52) and Great Britain's Gregor Tait (1:57.00) rounded out the finale.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nFive of the 8 finalists from the 2004 Games returned: gold medalist (and 2000 silver medalist) Aaron Peirsol of the United States, silver medalist Markus Rogan of Austria, bronze medalist (and 2000 finalist) Răzvan Florea of Romania, sixth-place finisher Simon Dufour of France, and seventh-place finisher Gregor Tait of Great Britain. Peirsol had won the 2001, 2003, and 2005 World Championships and held the world record from 2002 to 2007. His countryman Ryan Lochte, however, had emerged from Peirsol's shadow as a true threat to Peirsol's dominance. After taking bronze in 2005, Lochte defeated Peirsol at the 2007 World Championships, taking the world record as well. Peirsol responded by matching Lochte's record at the U.S. Olympic trials.\nThe Cayman Islands, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Uzbekistan each made their debut in the event. Australia and Great Britain each made their 12th appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to two swimmers if both met the A qualifying standard, or one swimmer if he met the B standard. For 2008, the A standard was 1:59.72 while the B standard was 2:03.90. The qualifying window was 15 March 2007 to 15 July 2008; only approved meets (generally international competitions and national Olympic trials) during that period could be used to meet the standards. There were also universality places available; if no male swimmer from a nation qualified in any event, the NOC could enter one male swimmer in an event.\nThe two swimmers per NOC limit had been in place since the 1984 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition followed the format established in 2000, with three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. The top 16 swimmers from the heats advanced to the semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition.\nSchedule.\nThe competition moved to a three-day schedule, rather than two days as in the past."

Alexander Dale Oen powered home with a silver in 59.20, earning a first Olympic medal for Norway in swimming. Coming from seventh place in the final turn, France's Hugues Duboscq managed to repeat a bronze from Athens four years earlier, in a time of 59.37. U.S. swimmer and defending silver medalist Brendan Hansen pulled off a fourth-place effort in 59.57, two-tenths of a second (0.20) behind Duboscq.\nAustralia's Brenton Rickard finished fifth with a time of 59.74, and was followed in sixth spot by Russia's Roman Sloudnov, bronze medalist in Sydney (2000), in a national record of 59.87. Ukraine's Igor Borysik (1:00.20) and American Mark Gangloff (1:00.24) rounded out the finale.\nEarlier, Dale Oen set a new Olympic record of 59.41 in the prelims, and eventually lowered it to 59.16 in the semifinals by the next morning's session. He continued to claim the title at the 2011 FINA World Championships, but his life came to a tragic end on April 30, 2012. Shortly after training at altitude in Arizona, Dale Oen was found unconscious in his apartment shower, and died suddenly from a cardiac arrest at Flagstaff Medical Centre.\nControversy.\nIran's Mohammad Alirezaei was due to race against Israel's Tom Be'eri in the fourth heat of the 100 metre breaststroke, but pulled out, apparently under the orders from officials of the Iranian delegation. Efraim Zinger, Olympic Committee of Israel General Secretary, criticized the withdrawal saying \"Politics takes precedence over sport with the Iranians and the Olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west\". Giselle Davies, director of communications for the IOC, said that Alirezaei withdrew because of sickness and submitted his case in writing to his Federation. At the 2004 Games in Athens, Iran's Arash Miresmaeili, a two-time world judo champion, refused to compete against Israel's Ehud Vaks in the opening round of the 66 kg competition, later admitting that he made his decision to show solidarity for the Palestinian cause.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition."

He registered a straightforward triumph over Brenton Rickard, who earned a silver medal in an Australian record of 2:08.88.

Earlier in the prelims, he established an Olympic record by winning the final of seven heats in 2:08.68.\nU.S. swimmer Scott Spann turned in another sub-2:10 barrier to earn a sixth spot in 2:09.76.

        "text": "The men's 100 metre butterfly event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 14–16 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China.\nU.S. swimmer Michael Phelps set a new Olympic record of 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one hundredth of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by the slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had remarked that it would be better for the sport if Phelps was defeated. Phelps' margin of triumph was so close that the Serbian team filed a protest, but after officials reviewed the video, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced that Phelps did touch the wall first and his victory would be upheld.\nKenya's Jason Dunford finished fifth with a time of 51.47, and was followed in the sixth spot by Japan's Takuro Fujii, in an Asian record of 51.50. Ukraine's Andriy Serdinov (51.59), the bronze medalist in Athens four years earlier, and Papua New Guinea's Ryan Pini, gold medalist at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, (51.86) closed out the field. Dunford and Pini also made history as the first swimmer for their respective nation to reach an Olympic final.\nOut of five individual events from his Olympic program, Phelps did not break the current world record in a final, finishing 0.18 of a second behind Crocker's time of 50.40, set in 2005. In the entire event, other records were established, the Olympic record, five continental records, and several national records.\nPreview.\nDue to a combination of the venue, Beijing National Aquatics Center (better known as the Water Cube), which was claimed to be built to increase the speed of the swimmers, and the recently introduced LZR Racer swim suits, which had been proven to give the swimmer a lower time by 1.9 to 2.2%, some analysts were predicting that many fast times and world records would be set in all the swimming events.\nAs with almost every event that he entered in at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Michael Phelps was the favorite to win the men's 100 metre butterfly. Since winning the gold medal at the previous Games, in Athens, Phelps had demonstrated his superiority in this event, by also becoming world champion at the Melbourne 2007 World Championships, and achieving victory at the United States Olympic Trials. Therefore, the 100 metre butterfly was one of the eight Olympic events where Phelps was attempting to win a gold medal.\nGoing into the event, Phelps' compatriot Ian Crocker was seen as the swimmer with the best chance of beating Phelps. Crocker beat Phelps' 100 metre butterfly world record in 2003, and had since lowered it twice: once at the 2004 United States Olympic trials, and then at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal. Before the Olympics, Crocker and Phelps held the seventeen fastest times ever in the event. In 2004, Crocker was the favorite in the men's 100 metre butterfly, but lost to Phelps by four hundredths of a second. This victory gave Phelps the right to swim in the final of the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, however he gave up the spot to Crocker, and took his turn in the semifinals. Although holding the world record, Crocker had lost the last four times that he was up against Phelps in the 100 metre butterfly, including the 2008 United States Olympic Trials. Some thought that Crocker was not in the same shape that he was when we broke the world record, including Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) analyst Byron MacDonald who said that \"If he's (Crocker) going to beat Phelps in Beijing, Crocker has to get close to his world record time of 50.40. He just hasn't shown it [he] can do it this year\".\nAnother threat to Phelps' goal was Serbia's Milorad Čavić. In Athens 2004, Čavić was leading in a semifinal of the 100 metre butterfly, but right after his final turn, his suit opened at the neck and sucked in water, causing Čavić to finish last with a time of 53.12 seconds. At the 2008 European Championships, Čavić won the men's 50 metre butterfly and was the heavy favorite to win at twice that distance, but was suspended for wearing a \"Kosovo is Serbia\" T-shirt on the medal podium. American swimmer Gary Hall Jr. told \"The New York Times\" that although \"Mike (Phelps) has been saying he's going to win the 100 fly at the Olympics for the last year\", he thought that Čavić would be the winner.\nOther possible medal contenders included Andriy Serdinov of Ukraine, who had won the Olympic bronze medal in 2004, and Venezuelan Albert Subriats, a bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships and seen as a potential spoiler, if he could match or improve on his 51.82 time, in Beijing.\nCompetition.\nHeats.\nThe heats began on August 14, at 19:57 local time (CST or UTC+8). There were nine preliminary heats, but all sixteen qualifiers came from the last five heats. Only three swimmers participated in the first heat, which was won by Andrejs Dūda of Latvia with a time of 55.20 seconds. \nHeats 2, 3, and 4 were won by Shaune Fraser (Cayman Islands), Rimvydas Šalčius (Lithuania), and Jakob Schioett Andkjaer (Denmark), respectively. Salcius, Jeremy Knowles (Bahamas), and Alon Mandel (Israel) all broke their countries' previous records, while in heat 4, Andkjaer, Michal Rubáček of the Czech Republic, Sotirios Pastras of Greece, and Ioan Stefan Gherghel of Romania also set new national records. \nSouth African Lyndon Ferns was the first swimmer to qualify for the semifinals, winning heat 5 with a time of 52.04 seconds, while national records were broken by Mario Todorović (Croatia), Simão Morgado (Portugal), and Douglas Lennox-Silva (Puerto Rico). \nSergii Breus (Ukraine) and Shi Feng (China), finished first and second in heat 6, with times of 51.82 and 51.87 seconds, respectively, that allowed them to reach the semifinals. \nFive of the eight swimmers in heat 7 advanced as well, including Jason Dunford (Kenya), Andrew Lauterstein (Australia), Takuro Fujii (Japan), Frédérick Bousquet (France), and Ryan Pini (Papua New Guinea). Dunford, with a 51.14 time, set a new Olympic record, beating Phelps' previous record of 51.25 seconds, achieved in the final of the 100 metre butterfly in Athens; he also set new African and Kenyan records. Andrew Lauterstein's 51.37 time was a new Oceanic and Australian best. Takuro Fujii set a Japanese and an Asian record with his 51.50 time.\nThe swimmers qualifying from heat 8 were Albert Subirats Altes (Venezuela), Corney Swanepoel (New Zealand), and Ian Crocker (United States). Records broken in this heat included the South American and Venezuelan records (by Altes), and the New Zealand record (by Swanepoel). \nHeat 9 was the fastest one, with Milorad Čavić (Serbia), Michael Phelps (United States), Andrii Serdinov (Ukraine), Peter Mankoč (Slovenia), and Kaio de Almeida (Brazil) all earning spots in the next round. Čavić, the heat's winner with a 50.76 time, beat the Olympic record set by Dunford two heats earlier, thus also setting a new European and Serbian record. Serdinov and Mankoč also managed to break their national records.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on August 15 and started at 11:26 CST. The first semifinal was won by Michael Phelps with a time of 50.97 seconds. Other three swimmers qualified from this semifinal: Andrew Lauterstein (51.27 seconds), Jason Dunford (51.33 seconds), and Ryan Pini (51.62 seconds). Surprisingly, Albert Subirats Altes, the bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships, failed to qualify, after finishing in the sixth place. Also missing the cut was the host nation's representative Shi Feng, Segii Breus, and Kaio de Almeida. \nThe second semifinal was won in 50.92 seconds by Milorad Čavić, once again. The remaining three qualifiers were Ian Crocker (51.27 seconds), Andriy Serdinov (51.41 seconds), and Takuro Fujii (51.59 seconds). New time bests set in the semifinals included the Oceanic and Australian records (set by Lauterstein), and the Chinese record (set by Shi).\nFinal.\nThe final took place on August 16, at 10:10 CST. Before the race, Milorad Čavić made headlines by saying in an interview that it would be better for swimming if he beat Phelps. Phelps' coach Bob Bowman used the quote to provide motivation to his protégé. In an interview, Phelps said that doubters like Čavić \"fires me up more than anything, I always welcome comments. It definitely motivates me even more.\" Almost immediately after the race started, Čavić took the lead with Phelps getting off to a slow start. At the turn, Čavić was first, followed by Ian Crocker, while Phelps made the split in seventh place, just 0.62 seconds behind Čavić. As the two approached the finish, Čavić tried to coast to the wall on one last stroke, while Phelps, who had misjudged the end, took an extra half-stroke, causing both competitors to touch the wall at almost exactly the same time. It turned out that Phelps had actually finished one one-hundredth of a second ahead of Čavić, with a time of 50.58 seconds. Phelps even admitted that, at first, he thought the extra stroke he took had cost him the gold medal, until he looked at the scoreboard displaying the results. Andrew Lauterstein won the bronze medal, also beating Crocker by one one-hundredth of a second.\nSeveral records were broken at the final. For the first time at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps did not break the current world record in a final, finishing eighteen one-hundredths of a second behind team-mate Crocker's 50.40-second world record from 2005; he did though set a new Olympic record. Three continental records were broken in the final, with Fujii setting a new Asian record, Čavić a new European record, and Lauterstein a new Oceanic record. Although he finished last, swimmer Ryan Pini made history as the first swimmer from Papua New Guinea to swim in an Olympic final, and even received a call from the prime minister Michael Somare congratulating him. Most notably though, Phelps won his seventh gold medal at these Games, tying Mark Spitz's record for most gold medals won at a single Olympic Games. For being able to emulate Spitz's record, Speedo, a sponsor of Michael Phelps, awarded him a US$1 million bonus, which had already been offered to him at the 2004 Summer Olympics, under the same conditions. After the final, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) arranged a joint interview with Phelps and Spitz, where Spitz praised Phelps' effort, telling him that \"what you did tonight was epic\" and even though at one point, Phelps was more than half a second behind Čavić, Spitz \"never thought for one moment you (Phelps) were out of that race.\"\nProtest.\nAlmost immediately after the end of the race, the Serbian team filed a protest claiming that Čavić touched the wall first but did not use enough force to trigger the timing sensor. Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA referee announced that \"It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps.\" Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtić, Serbia's deputy \"chef de mission\" for all sports, was quoted as saying \"in my opinion, it's not right, but we must follow the rules. Everybody saw what happened.\" In one interview following the race, Čavić said \"I am completely happy with where I am\", while in another he revealed that he expects that \"people will be bringing this up for years and saying you (Čavić) won that race. If we got to do this again, I would win it\". While the result is still controversial, a high speed photograph shows Phelps touching the wall, while Čavić is still a short distance away. In April 2015, Spitz said that he had been sent an email posted by Omega which stated that Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:"

        "text": "James B. Donnelly (July 19, 1865 – March 5, 1915) was an American professional baseball player whose career spanned from 1884 to 1900. He played all or part of 11 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a third baseman, for nine different major league clubs. In his 11 major league seasons, Donnelly compiled a .230 career batting average and led the National League's third basemen with 73 errors in 1886 and 275 assists in 1887.\nDonnelly's longest stints were with the Washington Nationals (243 games from 1887 to 1889), the Kansas City Cowboys (113 games in 1886), and the Baltimore Orioles (106 games in 1896). In 1896, he raised his batting average to .328 and was the starting third baseman for the 1896 Baltimore Orioles team than won the National League pennant with a 90–39 record.\nEarly years.\nDonnelly was born in 1865 in New Haven, Connecticut. His parents, Michael and Sarah Donnelly, were immigrants from Ireland. His father worked in a lock shop.\nProfessional baseball players.\nIndianapolis Hoosiers.\nDonnelly began his professional baseball career in 1884 with the Terre Haute, Indiana baseball club in the Northwestern League. In August of that same year, he made his major league debut with the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the National League. In 40 games with the Hoosiers, Donnelly compiled a .254 batting average\nIn 1885, the Hoosiers left the National League, lost their major league status, and joined the newly formed Western League in 1885. Donnelly remained with the Hoosiers at the start of the 1885 season and compiled a .211 batting average in 32 games. The Hoosiers were the dominant team in the Western League, compiling an .880 winning percentage.\nDetroit Wolverines.\nIn mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush developed to sign the players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included Sam Thompson, Deacon McGuire, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey. Donnelly was sold in a deal that sent most of the Hoosiers' roster to the Detroit Wolverines.\nDonnelly appeared in 56 games, all at third base, for the Wolverines during the 1885 season. He compiled a .232 batting average with four doubles, three triples, one home run and 22 RBIs.\nKansas City Cowboys.\nPrior to the 1886 season, Donnelly was purchased by the Kansas City Cowboys from the Wolverines. He appeared in 113 games, all at third base, for the Cowboys in 1886 and compiled a .201 batting average. He ranked among the leading National League third basemen that year with 73 errors (1st), 153 putouts (2nd), 13 double plays turned (3rd), and a 3.52 range factor (3rd).\nWashington Nationals.\nIn March 1887, the Washington Nationals purchased rights to Donnelly for $2,500. He played three seasons with the Nationals from 1887 to 1889. He was the team's starting third baseman during the 1887 and 1888 seasons, appearing in 239 games during those two seasons. During the 1887 season, he ranked among the leading National League third basemen with 63 errors (2nd), 21 double plays turned (2nd), a 3.57 range factor (4th), and 136 putouts (5th). He also ranked second in the league with 51 errors at third base in 1888.\nIn 1889, Donnelly appeared in only four games for the Nationals and spent most of the season with the newly formed Detroit Wolverines\nof the International Association. He compiled a .285 batting average in 89 games for Detroit in 1889 and played another 16 games for Detroit in 1890.\nSt. Louis and Columbus.\nOn July 19, 1890, Donnelly was dealt by Detroit to the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. In his return to the major leagues, he compiled a career high .333 batting average in 11 games with the Browns.\nDonnelly began the 1891 season with Omaha in the Western Association. He compiled a .268 batting average in 58 games with Omaha. In July 1891, Donnelly jumped from Omaha to the Columbus Solons of the American Association. He appeared in only 17 games for the Solons and was released on August 25, 1891.\nReturn to the minors.\nAfter his brief stint with the Solons, Donnelly again returned to the minor leagues, playing in the Eastern League for four years from 1892 to 1895, including stints with the Buffalo Bisons, New Haven Nutmegs, Troy Trojans, and Springfield Ponies. He compiled a .334 batting average in 101 games with Troy in 1893 and hit .305 in 93 games for Springfield in 1895.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nDonnelly returned to the major leagues in 1896 with the Baltimore Orioles. Donnelly appeared in 106 games as the team's third baseman, replacing John McGraw at the position. He joined an Orioles team that was managed by Ned Hanlon, featured Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler, and won the National League pennant with a 90–39 record. In May 1896, \"The Sporting Life\" wrote that \"[a] prettier or a headier fielder than Jim Donnelly it would be difficult to find\", but found it to be a pity that he was not more capable with the bat. In the end, Donnelly's bat perked up considerably in his only season with the Orioles, as he compiled a .328 batting average with 14 doubles, 10 triples, 71 RBIs, and 38 stolen bases.\nFinal years.\nIn November 1896, the Orioles traded Donnelly with Steve Brodie to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Elmer Horton, Tom O'Brien, Jake Stenzel and Harry Truby. Donnelly appeared in 44 games for the Pirates and finished the 1887 season appearing in 23 games for the New York Giants. His batting average in 1897 dropped to .191 – a decline of .137 points from the previous year.\nIn November 1897, the Giants traded Donnelly and Ducky Holmes with $3,500 to the St. Louis Browns for Mike Grady and Fred Hartman. In early April 1898, \"The Sporting News\" questioned Donnelly's readiness for major league play: \"Jim Donnelly has not shown up well so far. He has dicky legs, his fielding has not been particularly brilliant, and his batting has been lamentably weak.\" On May 12, 1898, Donnelly appeared in his first and only game for the Browns – Donnelly's last in the major leagues. He had a double in his only at bat in the game.\nAlthough his major league career ended in May 1898, Donnelly continued to play in the minor leagues through the 1900 season, including stints with the Syracuse Stars, New Haven Blues, and Springfield Ponies.\nLater years.\nAt the time of the 1900 United States Census, Donnelly was living with his mother, Sarah, and sister, Minnie, in New Haven, Connecticut. His occupation was listed as a ball player. Donnelly was married in 1909 to Elizabeth Kissan. By 1910, Donnelly and his wife were living in Stamford, Connecticut, and he was employed as a railroad brakeman. Donnelly died in 1915 at age 49 in Meriden, Connecticut.\nDonnelly played during the same time period as James Henry Donnelly, who played third base for the Kansas City Cowboys in 1884. Their statistics are often conflated into a single player record, but the two were unrelated."

        "text": "The Texas Longhorns women's volleyball team represents The University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate women's volleyball competition. The Longhorns currently compete in the Big 12 Conference.\nTexas has won five volleyball national championships – one AIAW championship in 1981 and four NCAA championships in 1988, 2012, 2022, and 2023. Beginning with the 1981 season, they have qualified for the AIAW/NCAA tournament every year except for two (41 of 43 seasons) and the most recent 20 years (2004–2023).\nThe volleyball program was founded in 1974. It has had seven head coaches in its history – the first four lasted just 1–2 years each: Pam Lampley (1974), Cheryl Lyman (1975), Jody Conradt (1976–77) and Linda Lowery (1978–79). Mick Haley coached from 1980 to 1996 before leaving to coach the Olympic team followed by the head coaching job at USC. Jim Moore coached 1997–2000 and Jerritt Elliott has coached Texas since 2001.\nTexas reached the NCAA Final Four in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1995, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, 2022, and 2023, winning NCAA championships in 1988, 2012, 2022, and 2023.\nDuring the 41-year history (1982–2022) of the AVCA Coaches Poll, the Longhorns have been ranked in the Top 10 in the final poll in 30 seasons, including the last 17 years at #8 or better (2006–2022). Only Nebraska and Stanford have more Top 10 final appearances than Texas.\nTexas dominated Big XII play for many years. Over the last 17 seasons Texas was a member of the Big XII (2007–2023), Texas won 94% of their Big XII matches (271 wins in 288 matches), finishing in first place fifteen times and second place twice. Overall, Texas has captured the Big XII Volleyball championship sixteen times: in 1997, 2007–2009, 2011–2015 and 2017–2023.\nDuring Texas Volleyball's fourteen seasons in the predecessor Southwest Conference (1982–1995), Texas was conference champion thirteen times and runner-up once.\nThrough 2018, Texas Volleyball has had 33 AVCA Division I All Americans, the fourth most of any program (through 2017).\nYear by year results.\n1986–1988.\nWomen's volleyball joined the NCAA in 1982. Texas made its first NCAA final four in 1986, coming in third place overall and finishing the year with a 29–6 record. In 1987, the team made it back to the final four, once again coming into third place and finishing the season with a 25–10 record.\nIn 1988, Texas broke through and won the NCAA national championship by sweeping Hawai'i 3–0. Texas became the first team in NCAA history (and, as of 2017, remains one of two schools to do so) to sweep every NCAA tournament opponent 3-0 en route to winning the NCAA volleyball championship.\n1995–1996.\nIn 1995, Texas made it to the championship match, falling to Nebraska 3–1. Also in 1995, Demetria Sance became the program's first ever player to be named the National Freshman of the Year. University of Texas joined the Big XII starting in 1996. Coach Mick Haley left the University Texas to manage the U.S. Olympic Team following a successful 1996 season.\n1997–2006: two coach changes but modest results.\nHaley's replacement Jim Moore's started strong by winning the Big XII in 1997, but his record began to worsen by 1999. In the disastrous 2000 season, a first ever losing record, a worst ever seventh place conference finish and missing the NCAA tournament for the first time, lead to Moore's replacement by Jerritt Elliot before the 2001 season. In 2003, Texas finished at 15–14, again finished seventh in the conference and again missed the NCAA tournament under Elliott. However, the Longhorns began to rebound for good in 2004 (Elliott's fourth year). In 2006, although finishing third in the conference, the Longhorns reached their first NCAA regional final in eight years.\n2007–2012 (National Title).\nIn 2007, Texas captured its second ever Big 12 title (and first conference title in ten years), sharing it with Nebraska and finished with a 19–1 conference record. The 2007 squad finished off the season with a 27–4 record and made it to the NCAA regional finals as the tournament's overall 4th seed. 2007 Big 12 Freshman of the Year Juliann Faucette became the program's second ever AVCA National Freshman of the Year and earned AVCA First Team All-America honors – becoming only the fourth true freshman in eight years to be named on the first team.\nIn 2008, Texas shared the Big 12 title with Nebraska with an 18–2 record. The team finished 29–4 overall, making it to the NCAA Final Four, where they took a 2–0 lead on Stanford but lost the next three to lose in five sets. Junior outside hitter Destinee Hooker was named to the Final Four All-Tournament Team and was also a Honda Sports Award nominee for the top volleyball player in the country. Hooker, junior Ashley Engle and senior Lauren Paolini were also named AVCA First Team All-Americans.\nLed by senior Destinee Hooker, the 2009 Texas volleyball team lost just one regular season match to Iowa State and was ranked No. 2 in the country all season long. In the 2009 NCAA tournament, the Longhorns defeated Big-12 opponent Nebraska in the regional final, becoming the first team to ever beat Nebraska three times in a season. In the Final Four, the team soundly defeated Minnesota, and met No. 1 and undefeated Penn State in the final.\nTexas looked to be on the brink of a huge upset, as they went up 2 sets to 0 against the Lions. However, Penn State stormed back to push the match to a fifth set, which they eventually won, 15–13. Penn State won their third consecutive NCAA title and denied Texas its first NCAA title since 1988. Despite the loss, Destinee Hooker was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player, as she had 34 kills in the championship match, which is the most kills by a single player in the NCAA final's history. It was also Hooker's career high in a single match, her final match as a collegiate player. Because of the high level of play by both teams throughout the long match, many people believe that it was the best NCAA final in history.\nIn 2012, Texas once again advanced to the NCAA final game, in which they played Oregon for the national championship. Texas swept the Ducks, 3–0, and claimed its first national title in volleyball since 1988, giving the university its 50th overall national championship, 42 of which are NCAA championships.\n2013–2018.\nThe program continued to excel following their national championship. In 2013 and 2014, they won the Big 12 and advanced to the national semifinals. In 2015, they once again won the Big 12 and advanced to the national championship game, but lost to Nebraska. In 2016, they finished second in the Big 12, snapping a streak of five consecutive Big 12 titles. However, they once again advanced to the national championship game, this time losing to Stanford.\nTexas, with a perfect 16–0 record, won the Big 12 championship in 2017 for the tenth time. In the 2017 NCAA tournament Texas was again eliminated by Stanford, this time by a 3–0 score in the Regional Final.\nIn 2018, despite two losses to nemesis, and eventual National Champion, Stanford during the regular season, Texas continued its winning ways at the conference level by easily clinching the Big 12 with a 15–1 record.\nTexas was seeded #5 in the 2018 NCAA Tournament. Texas defeated Stephen F Austin in the first round and Texas State in the second round each by a 3–0 score. Texas next beat Michigan 3–1 in the third round. However, Texas then lost 0–3 to #4 seed and regional host BYU in the Regional Final.\nTexas reached the Regional Final (round of 8) thirteen years in a row (2006-2018), advanced to the Final Four in 8 of 12 years (2008–2010, 2012–2016), and had three runner-up finishes 2009, 2015–2016, but won the NCAA championship just once over this period (in 2012).\n20192023 (Two National Titles).\nEarly in 2019, Texas had yet another loss to eventual National Champion Stanford and their first ever loss to an improved (final ranking #24) Rice team but also had two significant early season wins over (#4) Minnesota and (#17) BYU. During conference play, Texas swept NCAA #1 and undefeated Baylor 3–0 at home in late October in Austin to become the new NCAA #1. However, Baylor returned the favor by defeating Texas 3–2 in Waco in mid-November to retake NCAA #1. Texas at 15-1 was 2019 co-champion of the Big 12 with Baylor.\nTexas was seeded #2 in the 2019 NCAA tournament. Texas beat U. Albany 3–0 in the first round. Texas survived 3–2 over UCSB in the second round. Texas then was surprisingly upset by unranked Louisville 3–2 in the regional semifinal—Texas's worst NCAA tournament showing since 2005. It snapped Texas' 36 match home winning streak, Texas' streak of 13 straight Regional Finals appearances and was Louisville's first ever appearance in the Regional Final. Louisville was promptly swept 3–0 in the Regional Final by #7 Minnesota who Texas had swept during the regular season.\nTexas was seeded #4 in the 2020–21 NCAA tournament, which was played in April 2021 due to COVID-19. Texas received a bye in the first round and beat Wright State 3–0 in the second round. Texas beat traditional volleyball power Penn State 3–1 in the regional semifinal and advanced to their first final 4 since 2016 by beating Nebraska 3–1 in Omaha. Texas then advanced to the Finals by sweeping previously undefeated #1 Wisconsin 3–0, but losing there 3–1 to first-time Final Four participant Kentucky.\nIn 2021, Texas spent much of the regular season undefeated and #1 ranked before losing one of two matches to Baylor. Despite the loss, Texas again won the Big XII with a 15–1 record. Texas was seeded #2 in the 2021 NCAA tournament. Texas beat Sacred Heart 3–0 in the first round. Texas beat Rice 3–0 in the second round. After being down 2–0, Texas battled back to beat #15 Washington 3–2 in the regional semifinal. In the regional final, Texas lost to former SWC foe (&amp; only present or past conference foe against which Texas has a losing record) #10 Nebraska 3–1.\nIn 2022, Texas again spent much of the regular season #1 ranked except for a brief period at #2 immediately following their only loss of the regular season—to Iowa State. Despite the loss, Texas again won the Big XII with a 15–1 record. Texas at 22-1 was seeded #1 overall in the 2022 NCAA tournament. Texas beat Farleigh Dickinson 3–0 in the first round (including a dominating 25–6 win in the first set). Texas has won all 39 first round matches that it has contested in the NCAA tournament. Texas beat Georgia 3–0 in the second round. Texas has won its last 17 consecutive NCAA second round matches (2006–22). Texas then proceeded to defeat both #4 seed Marquette and #2 seed Ohio State by 3-1 scores to clinch the Regional Final and a trip to Omaha for the final four. In Omaha, Texas won its fourth national title by defeating San Diego 3–1 in the semis and then sweeping #1 seed Louisville 3–0 in the finals. Outside hitter Logan Eggleston was AVCA player of the year during the regular 2022 season and also MVP of the 2022 NCAA volleyball tournament.\nIn 2023, Texas started the year as #1 in the AVCA poll, yet a 2-2 start to the season with losses to Long Beach State and #2Stanford would see the Longhorns fall to #7. Despite a third loss to #11 Washington State, the Longhorns would finish the year as Big 12 Champions again with a 15-1 record and go 22-4 in the regular season. Texas would grab a #2 seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament. Texas would win over in-state rivals in Texas A&amp;M and SMU in the first two rounds. In the regional semifinals, Texas would overcome a 2-1 deficit against #3 Tennessee to win 3-2 and advance to their 4th straight regional final. In the final, Texas would get revenge over #1 Stanford and win the match 3-1, giving the Longhorns their 9th national semifinals appearance since 2010. In the semifinals, Texas would defeat #1 Wisconsin 3-1, winning the final two sets by a combined score of 50-29, advancing to their second straight national championship game. Texas would go on to beat #1Nebraska in straight sets through a dominant defensive performance with a .019 defensive hitting percentage. Madisen Skinner would be named the tournament MOP and Texas would get three players on the All-Tournament Final Four team.\nBeach volleyball.\nIn April 2008, the American Volleyball Coaches Association and Association of Volleyball Professionals sponsored the third annual Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship, adhering to NCAA guidelines for college volleyball. The Longhorns won the championship with a roster consisting of Jennifer Doris, Ashley Engle, Elizabeth Graham, Kiley Hall, Alyson Jennings, Heather Kisner, Chelsey Klein, Alex Lewis and Michelle Moriarty. Each school fielded four teams of two players. The field included Nebraska, Clemson, San Diego, USC, Texas and Wisconsin, all of whom were ranked in the 2007 Coaches Top 25 final poll (indoor). The Longhorns had finished the 2007 season ranked sixth.\nOn August 30, 2022, UT announced the addition of Beach Volleyball as the 21st Intercollegiate Sport at the University of Texas."

The head coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 33rd year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. Key contributors included senior Kristof Ongenaet, juniors Eric Devendorf, Arinze Onuaku, Andy Rautins and Paul Harris, sophomores Rick Jackson and Jonny Flynn and freshman Kris Joseph.\nPreseason.\nRoster changes.\nSyracuse lost its leading scorer from the previous season, forward Donté Greene, who declared for the 2008 NBA draft and was taken with the 28th overall pick by the Memphis Grizzlies. Greene was then traded to the Houston Rockets and again to the Sacramento Kings.\nSyracuse used Greene's scholarship to add Iowa State transfer Wesley Johnson. Johnson averaged 12.4 points per game during his sophomore season with the Cyclones, but must sit out the 2008–09 season. Syracuse will also have lacrosse recruit Kevin Drew, a walk-on.\nOn the injury front, Syracuse returned juniors Eric Devendorf and Andy Rautins. Both had suffered season ending knee injuries in the 2007–08 season and were granted medical redshirts. However, the Orange also learned before the season started that sophomore Scoop Jardine would be out for entire season after suffering a stress fracture in his left leg.\nRecruiting.\nCoach Boeheim was able to sign three recruits for the 2008–09 season: Kris Joseph, Mookie Jones and James Southerland. However, Southerland did not qualify with his SAT score to attend Syracuse, and returned to Notre Dame Preparatory Academy for an additional season of play.\nPreseason outlook.\nWith returning co-Big East Rookie of The Year Jonny Flynn, the Orange was picked to finish eighth in the Big East conference by the Big East coach's poll. Flynn was also a first-team all-Big East selection. Syracuse began the season ranked No. 30 in the Associated Press poll and No. 31 in the ESPN/USA Today poll.\nAlthough Syracuse was coming off two-straight NIT-bound seasons, and despite not having won an NCAA tournament game in four seasons, many experts picked Syracuse as a solid choice for the NCAA Tournament.\nSeason.\nSeason Recap.\nSyracuse started the season strong, winning the CBE Classic. In the semifinals on November 24, 2008, the Orange topped No. 17/18 Florida, 89–83. Jonny Flynn and Paul Harris led five SU players in double figures with 18 points each. In the finals on November 25, 2008, Syracuse defeated the defending champions, the No. 22/23 Kansas Jayhawks, 89–81 in overtime, to capture the CBE Classic. Jonny Flynn had 25 points, including a 3-pointer with 6.4 seconds left in regulation to send the game to overtime. Flynn was named MVP of the tournament.\nBut the season would hit a low point on December 15, 2008 when then-No. 11 Syracuse lost to unranked Cleveland State University 72–69 as a result of a 60-foot, buzzer-beating shot by Cleveland State's Cedric Jackson.\nSyracuse would add another key non-conference win on December 20, 2008, when then-No. 11 Syracuse won a key away game against national runner-up Memphis as Syracuse's stifling zone held Memphis to just 7-for-33 shooting from 3-point land. Flynn paced the Orange with 24 points and six assists, as Syracuse was able to deal with the loss of Eric Devendorf to a suspension after he was accused of hitting a female student on Nov. 1.\nPerhaps the biggest game of the season happened on March 12–13, 2009, when then-No. 18 Syracuse and No. 4 Connecticut played the longest game in Big East history, and second longest in NCAA Division I history, as Syracuse won 127–117 in six overtimes. Flynn set a new Syracuse record by playing 67 minutes.\nSyracuse would be named a No. 3 seed for the NCAA Tournament and win games over Stephen F. Austin (59–44) and Arizona State (78–67) to advance to the Sweet 16. But the Orange would be halted by Blake Griffin and Oklahoma in an 84–71 loss. The loss would mark the final game for Devendorf, Flynn and Harris, who all left the team following the season for the professional ranks.\nBig East tournament.\nSyracuse was seeded sixth and received a bye in the first round. They reached the finals of the 2009 tournament, where they were defeated by the first-seeded Louisville Cardinals, 76–66. It was their fourteenth time making the Big East tournament finals, the most for any team in the conference.\nPrior to making the finals, Syracuse's performance featured a conference record six-overtime quarterfinals game (the second longest game in NCAA history) in which they defeated third-seeded Connecticut 127–117. A day later, in the semifinals, the Orange were forced into overtime again, where they defeated West Virginia 74–69 in a single extra session.\nJonny Flynn was named the tournament's most outstanding player, becoming just the fourth player in Big East tournament history to win the award as a member of the second-place team.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Orange were seeded third in the South Region, and played fourteenth-seeded Stephen F. Austin on Friday, March 20 at American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. The Orange won, 59–44. They faced sixth-seeded Arizona State in the second round, winning 78–67.

        "text": "William Denton \"Dolly\" Gray (December 4, 1878 – April 4, 1956) was a left-handed professional baseball pitcher who played from 1909 to 1911 for the Washington Senators. \nBefore the big leagues.\nGray began his professional career during or before the 1902 season. In 1902, he pitched for the Los Angeles Angels of the old California League. Following the 1902 season, the Angels joined to the Pacific Coast League, and in 1903 they had one of the greatest seasons in minor league baseball history, with 133 wins against 78 losses. Gray went 23–20 with a 3.55 ERA that season. In 1904, Gray went 24–26, in 1905, he went 30–16, in 1906, he went 7–2 (during the 1906 season, Gray and many other West Coast players left to play on the East Coast after the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake), in 1907 he went 32–14 and in 1908 he went 26–11. He played in one game in 1909, winning it. In 1905 and 1907, he led the league in winning percentage.\nMajor league baseball.\nA 30-year-old rookie, Gray made his major league debut on April 13, 1909. He made 36 appearances in his rookie season, starting 26 of those games. He we 5–19 with 19 complete games. That year, he led the league in earned runs allowed (87), was third in losses, seventh in walks allowed (77) and eighth in appearances. On August 28 of that year, he set the major league record for most walks allowed in an inning, when he walked eight batters in the second inning. He also set the record for most consecutive walks in an inning, when he walked seven batters in a row. In total, Gray allowed 11 walks that game, giving up six runs and earning the loss in the process. Had he had better control, he may very well have won the game – he threw a one-hitter.\nIn 1910, Gray went 8–19 with a 2.63 ERA. He was second in the league in losses that year, fifth in wild pitches (9), ninth in earned runs allowed (67) and ninth in hit batsmen (10).\nOn April 12, 1911, Gray threw the very first pitch in Griffith Stadium history. He also won the game that day, beating opposing pitcher Smoky Joe Wood. That would be one of only two wins for Gray in 1912 – overall that season, he went 2–13 with a 5.06 ERA. His ten wild pitches that season were fourth most in the league, and his ten games finished were eighth most in the league. Gray played in his final major league game on September 29, 1911.\nGray went 15–51 with a 3.52 ERA in his three-year career. His .227 winning percentage is one of the worst all-time among pitchers with at least 50 career decisions. As a batter, Gray hit .202 in 218 big league at bats.\nPost-big league career.\nFollowing his major league career, Gray pitched in the Pacific Coast league from 1912 to 1913, retiring after the 1913 season. He played for the Vernon Tigers and Oakland Oaks in that time.\nFollowing his death, he was buried in Sutter Cemetery in Sutter, California.\nIn 2008, Gray was inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame, along with Wheezer Dell, Casey Stengel and Lee Susman."

        "text": "The 2002–03 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team represented Syracuse University in NCAA men's basketball competition in the 2002–03 Division I season. The head coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 27th year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 30–5 (13–3) record, while capturing its first modern-era NCAA Championship.\nThe team had just one senior, guard Kueth Duany. He was joined in the starting lineup by forwards Hakim Warrick (sophomore), Carmelo Anthony (freshman), center Craig Forth (sophomore), and guard Gerry McNamara (freshman). Other key contributors included guards Josh Pace (sophomore) and Billy Edelin (freshman), and center Jeremy McNeil (junior).\nSeason recap.\nThings did not start well for Syracuse. Guards DeShaun Williams and James Thues both left the team. Williams transferred to Iona while Thues left for Detroit. Freshman point guard Billy Edelin was suspended for 12 games for participating in a non-sanctioned basketball league. Syracuse then started its season with a loss against Memphis, despite Carmelo Anthony's 27 points, a then-high for a Syracuse freshman debut.\nBut things turned around, as Syracuse went 13–3 in the Big East, with several memorable wins. McNamara would establish himself as a clutch player, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82–80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February. In an upset of then-No. 24 Syracuse over then-No. 2 Pittsburgh, McNeil, a career 49.1% free throw shooter, hit two key free throws, and added a game-winning tip in a 67–65 upset.\nThe Orangemen would play five Big 12 teams throughout the year, including games against Missouri in the regular season, and against Oklahoma (Elite Eight), Oklahoma State (second round), Texas (National Semifinal) and then Kansas (National Championship game).\nIn the championship game against Kansas, with Syracuse leading by three with under 15 seconds left, Warrick missed two free throws that would've sealed the game with Syracuse hanging on to a three-point lead, 81–78. With 1.5 seconds left and the score still the same, Kansas' Michael Lee was open on the baseline for a potential game-tying 3-pointer. But Warrick used his long arms to block Lee's attempt and Syracuse captured its first-ever national championship.\nCoincidentally, the game was played in the Superdome in New Orleans, where Syracuse had lost the National Championship to Indiana in 1987 on a last-second shot by Keith Smart.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "2006–07 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2006–07 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team represented Syracuse University. The head coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 31st year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 24–11 (10–6) record, while making it to the quarterfinal round of the NIT tournament. The team was led by its three seniors, Demetris Nichols, Darryl Watkins and Terrence Roberts. Also seeing time in the starting lineup was senior Matt Gorman, junior Josh Wright, sophomores Eric Devendorf and Andy Rautins and freshman Paul Harris.\nDue to NCAA sanctions for use of ineligible players, 22 wins from this season have been vacated.\nSeason recap.\nSyracuse began its 2006–07 season looking for leadership after the graduation of four-year starter Gerry McNamara. Even without McNamara, the Orange had experience across the front line including seniors Demetris Nichols, Darryl Watkins and Terrence Roberts, while junior Josh Wright and sophomore Eric Devendorf rounded out the lineup. Other key players off the bench included sharp-shooting Andy Rautins, highly touted freshman Paul Harris, Mike Jones, Arinze Onuaku and senior Matt Gorman, the only holdover from the 2003 National Championship team.\nBefore the season even started, the Orange was hit with the injury bug, as Onuaku had season ending knee surgery. The Orange started ranked No. 17 in the AP Top 25 Poll, and won their first seven games, although they struggled through the early part of their schedule.\nInjuries struck once again, as Watkins broke his nose against UTEP, and Roberts hurt his knee versus Drexel. Meanwhile, Devendorf missed time because of the death of a friend from his hometown in Michigan. This played into their early season struggles, as Syracuse lost three games to Oklahoma State, Wichita State and Drexel.\nDevendorf was replaced in the lineup by Rautins, and while Harris showed flashes of his talent on defense and rebounding, he struggled with his shot and saw his playing time decrease.\nSyracuse started its Big East schedule with a loss to Pittsburgh, but wins at Marquette and versus Villanova and a narrow escape against Cincinnati. The win against the Bearcats would prove to be the calm before the storm, as Syracuse then lost to St. Johns, blew a 14-point lead at Louisville, and gave up 103 points in a loss to Notre Dame in the Carrier Dome. Seemingly a lock for the NCAA Tournament at the beginning of the season, the Orange was now a bubble-team. After winning against DePaul and then losing at Connecticut, Nichols scored a career-high 37 points in a two-point win against St. Johns.\nWith the team's record at 16–8 overall and 5–5 in the Big East conference, Boeheim made several adjustments in the Syracuse lineup. He sent the struggling Wright to the bench and moved Devendorf to the starting point guard position and Rautins to shooting guard.\nThe move paid dividends, as Rautins went on a shooting tear and helped the Orange to win five of their remaining six regular season games. One of those wins was against No. 10 Georgetown at the Carrier Dome, which many assumed stamped Syracuse's ticket to the NCAA Tournament. At season's end, Syracuse posted a 21–8 record and 10–6 in Big East play.\nIn the Big East Tournament, Syracuse seemed to put the cherry on the top of their NCAA bid, beating Connecticut soundly in the first round before getting knocked out by Notre Dame in the second round. However, on Selection Sunday, Syracuse fans were stunned when the Orange was not selected to the NCAA Tournament.\nIt was the first time that a team with 10 wins in the Big East Conference was not invited to the NCAA tournament. Selection Committee Chairman Gary Walters said some of the factors in not inviting Syracuse included playing an uneven in-conference schedule, and having a weak non-conference schedule.\nSyracuse headed to the National Invitation Tournament for the first time since the 2001–02 season. It defeated South Alabama and San Diego State before losing to Clemson in the quarterfinals of the NIT.\nAt season's end, Nichols was selected as a First Team All Big East performer, while Devendorf received All Big East Honorable Mention. Harris was named to the Big East All Rookie team."

The synagogue was founded at an undetermined date as the B'nai Israel Congregation. In 1932, the congregations of Anshei Shalom and Bnai Jacob congregations merged to form Agudas Israel Congregation. In the same year, it moved to a former church in Avondale. In 1952, Rabbi David Indich became the synagogue's spiritual leader. In 1957, it was noted that Golf Manor Synagogue had dedicated the first pre-fabricated synagogue.\nIn 1967, a new sanctuary for the synagogue of 350 families was built in Golf Manor on Stover Avenue and dedicated a year later. In 1989, Rabbi Balk became the Rabbi of the synagogue, while Rabbi Indich became Rabbi Emeritus. By 1994, the congregation had shrunk to a \"listed 250 membership units\". Toward the end of 2012, Rabbi Balk became Rabbi Emeritus. Rabbi Pinchas Landis became the new rabbi on January 1, 2013; with Rabbi Stuart Lavenda becoming the senior rabbi in October 2014. Lavenda maintained that role until his retirement March 2019, being succeeded by Rabbi Yosef Alt who took leadership of Golf Manor Synagogue as head rabbi in January 2019."

        "title": "Tour de France during World War II",
        "text": "The Tour de France was not held because of World War II because the organisers refused German requests. Although a 1940 Tour de France had been announced earlier, the outbreak of the war made it impossible for it to be held. After that, some attempts were made by the Germans during the war to have a Tour de France to maintain the sense of normality, but \"l'Auto\", the organising newspaper, refused. Some other races were run as a replacement.\nAfter World War II, \"l'Auto\" was closed for collaborating with the Germans. The rights to organise the Tour went to the French government. As two newspapers were interested in these rights, they each organised a small Tour of five stages; the race run by \"L'Équipe\" was considered the more successful, so \"L'Équipe\" was allowed to organise the 1947 Tour de France.\nHistory.\nAlready before the war, the political situation in Europe had its influence on the Tour de France. Political reasons caused Italy, Germany and Spain to refuse to send teams to France for the 1939 Tour de France. The 1938 Tour de France winner, Gino Bartali, was among those affected. Henri Desgrange, the original race organizer, and Jacques Goddet, his deputy and replacement, announced plans for a Tour de France in August 1940.\nRaces planned or held during the Occupation.\n1940 Tour de France.\nHenri Desgrange planned a Tour for 1940, after war had started but before France had been invaded. The route, approved by military authorities, included a route along the Maginot Line. Teams would have been drawn from military units in France, including the British, who would have been organised by a journalist, Bill Mills. The plans were dropped after the German invasion. The records and paperwork of the Tour were taken south to keep them safe but were never seen again. Desgrange died in August 1940, and his successor, Jacques Goddet, initially wanted to organise the Tour during the war, arguing that sport should remain neutral.\n1941 Tour de France.\nIn 1941, the newspaper \"Paris-Soir\", run by Germans, tried to persuade \"l'Auto\" to coorganize the Tour, but Goddet did not accept.\n1942 Tour de France.\nThe German Propaganda Staffel wanted the Tour to be run and offered facilities otherwise denied, in the hope of maintaining a sense of normality. They offered to open the borders between German-occupied France in the north and the nominally independent Vichy France in the south, so that \"l'Auto\" could organize a Tour, together with \"La France Socialiste\", but Goddet refused. He was, in any case, in little position to run a race of that scale because many of the staff had left \"L'Auto\"'s office in Paris to go south.\n1942 Circuit de France.\n\"La France Socialiste\", run by Jean Leulliot, Goddet's former colleague at \"L'Auto\", did not have the same reluctance, and organized the race on its own. Leulliot, who had been manager of the French team that won the Tour in 1937, had become head of sport at \"La France Socialiste\" which, despite its name, was a right-wing paper that sympathized with the Germans. Leulliot assembled sixty-nine riders for the race, the Circuit de France, which ran from 28 September to 4 October 1942. Over six stages and , it went from Paris to Paris via Le Mans, Poitiers, Limoges, Clermont-Ferrand, St-Étienne, Lyon and Dijon.\nOne of the riders, Émile Idée, told the writer and cyclist Jean Bobet that he had been threatened with the Gestapo if he did not take part. Bobet said: \"I asked him to repeat it to see if I had understood. I was stunned [\"dans la tête ça fait tilt\"]!\"\nThe Circuit de France was organized between 28 September 1942 and 4 October 1942 by \"La France Socialiste\" in both the occupied zone and Vichy France, to give a feeling of nationality. The race had six multinational teams, and was won by François Neuville. The inexperience of the organizers, combined with bad weather and logistical problems, made the race a disaster. Although there were plans to hold the race again in 1943, it was never held.\nThe mountains classification was won by Pierre Brambilla.\n1943 Tour de France.\nThe 1943 Tour de France was not held, but instead, \"L'Auto\" organized a readers' poll in 1943 to name the perfect team for a Tour de France, were one to be run. More than 10,000 took part.\n1943 Grand Prix du Tour de France.\nIn 1943, \"l'Auto\" ran what it called the \"Grand Prix du Tour de France\", the paper's assessment of the greatest riders calculated using their placings in single-day races, all organised by \"l'Auto\". At the end of the season, a yellow jersey was given to the cyclist with the best overall classification. The winner was Jo Goutorbe. Even though The Grand Prix du Tour de France was organized by Jacques Goddet, he made it clear that it was not an official Tour de France.\nThe Grand Prix du Tour de France 1943 consisted of the following races:\n1944 Grand Prix du Tour de France.\nIn 1944, the Grand Prix du Tour de France was done again, but it was not completed because the liberation of France stopped the races from being run. Maurice De Simpelaere was the leader at the time the races were interrupted.\nCandidate Tours after liberation.\nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, \"L'Auto\" was closed and its belongings, including the Tour de France were sequestered by the state for having published articles too close to the Germans. All rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government. Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, \"L'Équipe\", but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of the magazines \"Sports\" and \"Miroir Sprint\". Each organised a candidate race. \"L'Équipe\" and \"Le Parisien Libéré\" had \"La Course du Tour de France\", (\"The Race of the Tour de France\" – as close as they dared come to calling the race by its original name), and \"Sports\" and \"Miroir Sprint\" had \"La Ronde de France\". Both were five-stage races, the longest the government would allow because of shortages.\nRonde de France.\nFrom 10 to 14 July 1946, the Ronde de France was organized. The cyclists were divided in commercial teams, but the commercial teams were each allowed to field two teams, one composed of French cyclists and one of foreign cyclists. It was won by Giulio Bresci, who also won two stages and the mountains classification.\nLa Course du Tour de France.\nThe Course du Tour de France (), also known as Monaco–Paris was organised in 1946 by \"Le Parisien Libéré\" together with \"l'Equipe\". The race had many things familiar to the old Tours de France: there were six national teams and five regional French teams, and the leader in the race was also given a yellow jersey.\nThe race was won by French cyclist Apo Lazaridès. The mountains classification was won by Jean Robic.\nAftermath.\nThe Course du Tour de France, \"L'Équipe\"'s race, was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams which had been so successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high. In late 1946, both organisers intended to organise their race again in 1947, this time at the same time. The UCI then decided in December 1946 to give \"L'Équipe\" the right to organize the 1947 Tour de France. After their main rival \"Sports\" objected to this, the rights were instead given to La Societé du Parc du Princes, because this was thought to be a neutral choice. In early 1947, it became clear that the organisation of the Tour de France was difficult financially without a newspaper and, in June 1947, one month before the 1947 Tour de France would start, the Societé du Parc du Princes transferred the rights to \"L'Équipe\".\nÉmile Besson, communist sports writer and a member of the Resistance from 1943 when he was 17, called \"L'Équipe\"'s victory political. Besson, who was a member of the national study into French sport under the Occupation, set up by Marie-George Buffet when she was sports minister between 1997 and 2002, said:\nIt was a bit much to have given them the right to run the Tour again after all that [referring to \"L'Auto\"'s pro-German attitude and closure]. Goddet had the keys to the Velodrome d'Hiver when [the Germans wanted it] in the round-up of Jews in July 1942. After the Liberation, the battle between Left and Right had the Tour as one of its prizes.\nGoddet had to defend his wartime behaviour at an inquiry in Algiers. He pointed to the way he had allowed Resistance workers to print anti-German tracts at his newspaper and called Émilien Amaury in his defence. Amaury had a blameless record in the Resistance. He was also a right-wing businessman; his ideals close to Goddet's. It was with Amaury and his paper, \"Le Parisien Libéré\", that Goddet ran La Course du Tour de France. It was Amaury's reputation that landed Goddet the Tour. That, says Besson, and because the rival candidate was two magazines with a communist background and President Charles de Gaulle was determined to limit communist influence. De Gaulle had spent much of his time during the war trying to prevent communist domination of the Resistance. Communists held many key positions in France just before and after Liberation but De Gaulle refused even to thank them for their work. Albert Bourlon, who won the 14th stage of the 1947 Tour de France, told Jean Bobet that he was convinced that his membership of the Communist Party denied him access to the race afterwards.\nAmaury eventually took control of both the paper and the Tour de France, which the family still controls to this day with the family-owned Amaury Sport Organisation, since 2006 controlled by grandson Jean-Étienne Amaury.\nJean Leulliot was tried for his role in organising races under German patronage but he was cleared after fellow journalists, including Goddet, spoke in his favour."

        "title": "Johnny Williams (rugby union, born 1882)",
        "text": "John Lewis Williams (3 January 1882 – 12 July 1916) was a Welsh international wing who played club rugby for Cardiff Rugby Football Club. A three times Triple Crown winner, out of seventeen appearances for Wales he was on the losing side only twice.\nWilliams began his first class rugby career with Newport RFC, playing for them from 1899 to 1903. He joined Cardiff RFC after moving to the town, and spent the rest of his career with the team. Shortly after joining Cardiff, he was invited to play for the Wales national rugby union team in 1906. He continued to represent Wales until 1911 becoming the country's top points scorer. Shortly after retiring, he enlisted in World War I, and was wounded in the Battle of the Somme, dying in France on 12 July 1916.\nEarly life.\nJohn Lewis Williams was born the son of Edward Lewis Williams in Llwyncelyn, Whitchurch, Glamorgan in 1882. He was educated at Cowbridge Grammar School, where he played association football, rather than rugby.\nRugby career.\nEarly years.\nHaving played association football at school, Williams switched to playing rugby with the Whitchurch Village rugby club. From the start of his career, he played on the left wing. In 1899, Williams was invited to play at Newport RFC under the newly appointed captain, Llewellyn Lloyd. Several players had departed, leaving gaps in the backline, and Williams was brought in, alongside Cliff Pritchard and W. Isaacs, while the effective pairing of Lloyd and Lou Phillips at halfback continued. In Williams' first season at Newport, the team scored a total of 416 points compared with the previous season's 192. The following season was Newport's third best on record. However, Williams was injured during the course of the year. Nevertheless, his contributions were noted: against Moseley, despite an early error, he scored a try in the first quarter \"after a grand run\", and at the beginning of the second half, managed to touch down a second try, just before Yates \"grassed him\".\nMoving to Cardiff on business, Williams joined Cardiff RFC, and began a memorable partnership with Rhys Gabe at left centre, each of them scoring ten tries in their first season, 1903–04. The following season, he was the team's top try scorer, with 16 tries to his name. In the 1905–06 season, Cardiff was undefeated except against the touring All Blacks in December 1905. In the run up to that encounter, Cardiff played Blackheath on 9 December. Williams did not play: the Welsh Rugby Union requested that Cardiff field Willie Llewellyn of Pennygraig and Teddy Morgan of London Welsh, who would be representing Wales against New Zealand the following week, alongside Cardiff's centres Nicholls and Gabe. Instead, the same day, Williams took the place of Morgan at London Welsh against Harlequins. Wales won 3–0 against New Zealand, and became the first team in 27 games to beat the tourists. Cardiff then faced the New Zealanders on Boxing Day 1905. Nicholls, Gabe, Winfield and Bush had represented Wales against the All Blacks, and it was Nicholls who opened the scoring for Cardiff that day, with Winfield converting. New Zealand levelled the scores 5–5 before the break, and took the lead after it with another converted try. Towards the end, Cardiff scored a try, but Bush was unable to convert, giving the visitors a 10–8 victory. Williams was again Cardiff's top try scorer for the season, contributing 35 tries, five of them against the Barbarians in April.\nFirst season for Wales (1906–07).\nBy the start of the 1906–07 season, Williams was considered one of the best wings in all of the Home Nations. He was noted for his turn of speed, clever dodging, and determined running for the line. So, when the touring team from travelled to Swansea, and Billy Trew was unavailable due to injury, Williams earned his first cap for on 1 December 1906. Wales lost the game, the first defeat at home in 11 years, outclassed in every part of the game. In the backline, the Springboks were quicker and combined well in attack. Williams \"justified his selection\" but was not reckoned to be in the same class as Morgan, who was shifted to the right wing from his usual position on the left, and under-utilised there.\nA month later, on 1 January 1907, Cardiff played hosts to the South Africans and beat the visitors 17–0 in front of 30,000 spectators. Heavy rain turned the ground into a \"quagmire\", and a strong wind blew from one end to the other. Cardiff won the toss and opted to play with the wind. Williams' first touch of the ball was erratic, failing to hold on to a catch in the initial stages, when he had a clear run to the tryline. After Cardiff had scored two tries in the first half with no response from the Springboks, Williams had another chance to score, but again fumbled the ball. At half time, Cardiff was leading by 11 points, already the largest score against the South Africans in any of the tour matches. Well into the second half, Williams received a pass from Rhys Gabe. Between him and the tryline was Marsberg, the opposition fullback, and \"one of the most magnificent tacklers\" to have played in Wales. Williams approached Marsberg and, with a swerving run, \"diddled\" him, and scored a try in the corner. Marsberg then ran up to him and shook him by the hand in recognition of the move. The contemporary rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell commented that the try he scored \"against the South Africans for Cardiff will never be forgotten by those that witnessed it.\"\nWilliams was then confirmed to play against England at Swansea on 12 January in a team much changed from that which was beaten by South Africa the previous month. The London \"Express\" commented that neither he nor Maddock on the other wing, had much merit, but were selected for a lack of choice, the whole team being unexceptional. Welsh spectators, expecting defeat at the hands of the English, stayed away from the game, and only 5,000 turned out, a record low for international rugby in Wales. But the headline in the 'Pink Edition' of the \"Evening Express\" read \"St George Routed\", as Wales beat England 22–0. Right from the start, the Welshmen seemed up to the task. An early try-scoring opportunity was lost when Gabe was tackled and unable to make the pass to Williams, who was in the clear. Wales came close to scoring a few more times, until Gabe receiving the ball from Trew, timed his pass perfectly to Williams, and he scored in the corner. Most of the play till this point had been in England's 25, but when the English broke out, Williams' defensive play was called into action. At half time, with further tries from Gibbs and Maddock, the Welsh were leading 13–0. England started the second half well but, after a long period in the Welsh half, Wales got an attacking opportunity, and Gabe, receiving the ball from Trew, beat his opposite number, and passed to Williams, who scored a second try in the corner. Maddock and Brown then scored two more tries, for a total of six to Wales.\nThe next game, away to Scotland on 2 February, resulted in defeat for Wales, with the seven forwards system receiving much of the blame. The Williams–Gabe combination performed well on the left wing, but the Welshmen were unable to cross their opponents' line. Against Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park on 9 March, Wales fielded a team including eight Cardiffians. Gabe was appointed captain for the match, while Billy Trew - the former captain - and Dicky Jones, were replaced at halfback by Percy Bush, Cardiff's captain, and Dicky David, also from Cardiff and earning his first - and only - cap for Wales. Wales beat Ireland 29–0, and 26 of the points came from Cardiff players. In the first four minutes of the game, the Welshmen reached the Irish 25. Following a scrum, the ball reached Gabe, and he, after making some ground, passed to Williams, who ran in a try unopposed. Early in the second half, with Wales leading by two tries to nil, a lineout to Wales on the Irish 25, resulted in Williams receiving the ball and, after breaking through the Irish defence, with only Hinton, the fullback, to beat, passed to Gabe to score the try. Williams scored a second try after David, receiving the ball from the forwards, passed to Bush, who got past the Irish halfbacks, and passed to Gabe, missing out Evans. Gabe then ran up to Hinton, and passed the ball to Williams to score. A third try came for Williams in similar style, and he came close to scoring a fourth. The David–Bush halfback pairing, and the Gabe–Williams partnership on the left wing, supported by the excellent play of Winfield at fullback, and that of the forwards, were the decisive factors in the Welsh triumph over Ireland.\nWilliams was again Cardiff's top try scorer in 1906–07, touching down 19 times in the season.\nUnbeaten seasons (1907–1909).\nWales was unbeaten in 1908 and 1909. At the end of the 1907–08 season, in which Williams was again top try scorer for Cardiff with 13 tries, Williams was part of Arthur Harding's Anglo-Welsh team that toured the Antipodes. Although an unsuccessful tour, he played well and ended as the team's top try scorer. He then missed the start of the 1908–09 season and did not return to Cardiff until November. The club faced Australia on 28 December 1908, and handed the tourists the biggest defeat of their tour, 24–8, Williams providing two tries. Cardiff finished the season as Welsh Champions, Williams having scored 15 tries in 26 appearances, to Spiller's 16 in 27.\nFinal years (1909–1911).\nWilliams was captain of Cardiff in 1909–10, winning 22 out of 36 games, with 7 drawn. Williams was not the top try scorer that season for Cardiff, managing 13, compared with 21 from Gibbs and 14 from Spiller.\nOn 1 January 1910, Williams played for Cardiff against Bristol, while Maddocks played on the wing for Wales against France. For the match against England on 15 January, Williams was called up as a reserve. However, in a game for Cardiff against Moseley, he picked up an injury to his thigh that would necessitate a few weeks out. After the England game, which Wales lost, it was rumoured that Williams would be recalled to the wing for the match against Scotland, but his injury persisted. The Welsh defeated Scotland, and it was expected that they would field unchanged team for the final game of the tournament, against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 12 March. Melville Baker, however, was injured playing on the left wing and opened up a place for Williams to be selected. Once again the Welsh backline was filled with Cardiff men: Bush, Spiller, Dyke, Gibbs, who took on the captain's duties, and Williams. Joe Pugsley, another Cardiff man, was in the Welsh pack. Ireland were leading by a try until just before half time, when Williams scored a try to bring Wales level. In the second half, he scored two more; Gibbs and Dyke each scored one, while Bush kicked a dropgoal, to win the game 3–19. \"Forward\" writing in the \"Evening Express\" said: \"Williams was right on top of his form, and his cleverness in beating three or four Irishmen, including the fullback, before he scored his three tries was really splendid.\"\nThe following season, however, with Gibbs as captain, Williams scored 27 tries, 8 of them split equally across two games against Moseley. \nWilliams, who could speak French, skippered Wales against France. Williams retired from playing at the end of the 1910–11 season.\nWilliams was part of three Welsh Triple Crown winning sides, lost only two matches and scored 17 tries in his 17 games.\nMilitary service.\nWilliams fought for his country in the First World War. He joined the Royal Fusiliers on 24 September 1914, and was then commissioned second lieutenant into the 16th Battalion Welsh Regiment in December. He was promoted to lieutenant in February 1915, and to captain the following month. His Regiment, part of the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, was deployed to the Western Front in December 1915, and took part in the Battle of the Somme, which began on 1 July 1916. The 38th Division was brought into action, when it relieved the 7th Division on 5 July to the south of Mametz Wood. On 7 July, the 38th attacked German positions in Mametz Wood. Williams was leading his men in the attack when he was wounded. He was evacuated but eventually died of his wounds on 12 July at No. 5 Casualty Clearing Station in Corbie.\nHe is buried in Corbie Communal Cemetery Extension, near Amiens, France. He was married to Mabel."

He played eight seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, and Los Angeles Kings from 1964 to 1972. He went on to play three seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the Minnesota Fighting Saints and Indianapolis Racers from 1972 to 1975.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on November 7, 1942. He played three seasons for the Winnipeg Rangers of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League from 1959 to 1961, before joining the Sudbury Wolves of the Eastern Professional Hockey League the following season.\nProfessional career.\nJohnson was signed by the New York Rangers during the 1963–64 season and played for the St. Paul Rangers, their minor league affiliate, until the latter part of 1964–65, when he made his NHL debut. That turned out to be the only NHL game he would play in that year. He played in only seven games over the next two seasons, scoring one goal. He was subsequently drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers with the 75th selection of the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft.\nJohnson scored the first goal in Flyers' franchise history during an exhibition game. During his first season with the team in 1967–68, he had two goals and one assist in 13 games. He played his first full NHL season the following year, amassing 44 points (including 17 goals) in 69 games. It was the first of three seasons in which Johnson scored 16 or more goals for the Flyers. He recorded career-highs in points (48) and assists (30) in 1969–70, and scored his first hat-trick on December 3, 1969, against the Los Angeles Kings.

        "text": "The Lincoln Stars (also known as the Lincoln Stars of New York or the New York Lincoln Stars) were a Negro league baseball team that played in New York City from 1914 to 1917. Their home stadium was the Lenox Oval, located at Lenox Avenue and 145th Street in Manhattan. Although they lasted less than four years, they were a good team that featured three players who would later be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame—Oscar Charleston, John Henry Lloyd, and Louis Santop.\nFounding and inaugural season.\nIn 1914, Jess and Ed McMahon, brothers who had previously founded the Lincoln Giants, formed the Lincoln Stars. In the team's first summer, its roster included second baseman William Parks, left fielder Jap Payne, power-hitting first baseman Bill Pettus, and catcher Bill Pierce.\nIn the fall of 1914, the Lincoln Stars toured Cuba. A number of players were recruited from the Lincoln Giants, including manager and center fielder Spottswood Poles, pitchers Dick Redding and Dizzy Dismukes, catcher Louis Santop, and left fielder Jules Thomas. In 14 games played against Habana and Almendares between October 9 and November 2, the Stars won 4, lost 9, and tied 1. Researcher Gary Ashwill has tabulated complete statistics for 13 of the 14 games. In a pitching-dominated series, the Stars' top hitters in these games were Poles, who hit .313, and Santop, who hit .289. Redding had 2 wins and 3 losses with a 2.59 total run average and 32 hits, 17 walks, and 27 strikeouts in innings pitched. Both of Redding's wins were shutouts—a 4-hit, 1–0 victory over Habana on October 15 and a 3-hit, 3–0 win over the same team on October 19.\n1915 season.\nThe 1915 team was regarded as perhaps the strongest black team in the East. The team comprised Redding and Doc Sykes as pitchers, Pierce as catcher, Pettus at first base, Bill Kindle at second base, Sam Mongin at third base, John Henry Lloyd at shortstop, Jude Gans in left field, Poles in center field, and Santop in right field and as backup catcher. They played a championship series against the Chicago American Giants, but the series ended in controversy. Each team won five games, and the deciding eleventh game was called in the fourth inning with the Stars ahead by a run, but the game was never completed or replayed. After the series, Lloyd and Gans jumped the Stars to rejoin the American Giants.\n1916 season.\nThe 1916 Lincoln Stars again were one of the strongest teams in the East. This season has the most complete statistics of any of their seasons, based on league statistics compiled by Ashwill. The Stars played 23 known games against major Negro league opponents. Their overall record was 10–13, with a 5–3 record against Eastern opponents and 5–10 against Western teams. The Stars' roster consisted of pitchers Sykes, Gunboat Thompson, and Ad Lankford, catcher Santop, first baseman Pettus, second baseman C. Johnston, third baseman Lee Miller, shortstop Parks, left fielder Ashby Dunbar, center fielders Bruce Hocker and Oscar Charleston, and right fielder Peter Green. Statistics for individual players were compiled from box scores for 18 of their games. Their top hitters were Pettus, who hit .408, Santop (.318), Parks (.311), Charleston (.308), and Dunbar (.294). The highlight of their season was another championship series against the Chicago American Giants, 7 games played from August 6 through August 18. Just before the series, Oscar Charleston jumped the team to rejoin the Indianapolis ABCs, with whom he had played the previous season. Despite the absence of Charleston, the Stars took a 3–2 lead in the series, but then lost the last two games.\nDemise during 1917 season.\nThe 1917 Stars team failed to finish the season. Many of the players moved on to play with the Pennsylvania Red Caps of New York."

He won 15 caps for Wales and played county rugby for Glamorgan.\nRugby career.\nJones, along with Dicky Owen, created one of the most devastating half-back pairings to play for Swansea. Known as the 'Dancing Dicks', Jones and Owen replaced the James brothers for Swansea, and would later bring their partnership to the Welsh team. The Welsh selectors tended to choose club pairings at half back, and when Newport's Lou Phillips was injured in a match against Scotland, he and his partner Llewellyn Lloyd were gradually replaced by Jones and Owen. The partnership would last for 15 games, a Welsh record for half-backs that was unbeaten until Barry John and Gareth Edwards in 1971.\nJones played for Swansea for 12 seasons and was a member of the 'All White' team that beat the touring Australians in 1908.\nJones made his debut against Ireland in 1901. Although dropped for a time between 1902 and 1904, he reestablished himself with some excellent kicking and running against Scotland. Unfortunately for Jones he broke his instep in a club game in 1905 and did not play rugby again until late 1907. His return in 1908 was against France in a Grand Slam decider, Jones scored the winning try to lift the trophy for Wales. Jones scored two other tries in his international career, against Scotland in 1904 and England in 1905. Jones should have also scored against Ireland, which would have given him a try against all the tournament teams, but had a try disallowed in the 1903/04 season in Belfast through poor refereeing.\nIn 1911 Owen and Jones were dropped after a terrible Welsh display against England, in which Jones was constantly harried throughout the game by England's wing-forward, 'Cherry' Pillman. Wales only lost the match 11–6, mainly due to a first minute error by Bridgend's Benjamin \"Ben\" Gronow that allowed England to score, but Wales could not get back into the game. The fact that this was the first time a Welsh team had lost to England since 1898 gave the selectors a big enough reason to change personnel for the next few matches. Although Owen would be selected again, Jones suffered a serious accident that ended his playing career.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nPersonal history.\nJones is the great-grandfather of New Zealand comedian Dai Henwood."

However, among the four majors, the US Open, Australian Open and Wimbledon (since 2019) use the tiebreak in the final set, while the French Open, through 2021, was the only major to use the advantage set rules in the final set, which allows for an indefinite number of games until one player is ahead by two. A 2022 rule change now requires every Grand Slam tournament, even the Olympics (since 2021), to use the tiebreak in the final set.\nAll competitions.\nOverall.\nLongest matches by duration.\nOnly two professional competitive matches have lasted longer than seven\nhours and 14 matches have lasted longer than six hours.\nMen's singles.\nThe Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships holds the record for the longest tennis match both in time and games played. It lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes.\nWomen's singles.\nThe longest women's match (by time) took place at a tournament in Richmond, Virginia, in 1984, when Vicki Nelson took 6 hours, 31 minutes to defeat Jean Hepner 6–4, 7–6(13–11). The match featured a 29-minute, 643-shot rally, the longest in professional tennis history, though no video exists of this point.\nUnlike men's singles matches, where Grand Slam events are still played over the best of five sets, all women's matches are now played as the best of three sets. All matches since January 1, 2019 have been checked, but there are likely to be many more from earlier years which have not yet been recognised, especially as qualifying matches in ITF tournaments before that date would normally have been played over the best of three tie-break sets.\nWhere different sources give durations for a particular match, the shortest elapsed time will be the one noted below.\nThe longest match consisting of two standard sets and a match tie-break was played in the second qualifying round of a $25,000 ITF tournament in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on January 9, 2023. Valentina Mutilba defeated Luciana Blatter 6–7(7–9), 7–6(12–10), [10–7]. The official ITF live scoring data recorded the duration as three hours and 44 minutes, but SofaScore and TNNS both recorded three minutes less.\nWimbledon.\nMen's singles.\nThe 2019 Wimbledon\nMen's final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic lasted 4 hours 57 minutes and is the third longest singles final by time played."

It also contains and clarifies cases where subsequent evidence and explanation has shown the parties to be innocent of illegal practice.\nIn 1963, the Council of Europe gave the following definition of doping:\n\"Doping is the administration to a normal subject in any possible way of a foreign agent or abnormal quantities of physiological substances with the sole purpose of increasing artificially and in an unfair manner the performance of the subject participating in a contest.\"\nThe International Olympic Committee slightly modified this, and adopted this definition:\n\"The administration of or use by a competing athlete of any substance foreign to the body or any physiologic substance taken in abnormal quantity or taken by an abnormal route of entry into the body with the sole intention of increasing in an artificial and unfair manner his/her performance in competition. When necessity demands medical treatment with any substance which, because of its nature, dosage, or application is able to boost the athlete's performance in competition in an artificial and unfair manner, this too is regarded as doping.\"\n1880s.\n1886.\nIn 1886, a Welsh cyclist is popularly reputed to have died after drinking a blend of cocaine, caffeine and strychnine, supposedly in the Bordeaux–Paris race. This was included in the 1997 International Olympic Committee study on the \"Historical Evolution of Doping Phenomenon\", and listed as the presumed first death due to doping during a competition. The report did allow that in this period it was common practice, and not illegal. This is alternatively reported as trimethyl poisoning. However, the main Bordeaux–Paris race did not start until 1891, and the cyclist who supposedly died in 1886, Arthur Linton, actually finished second in 1896 and died a few weeks later, reportedly from a combination of drug-induced exhaustion and typhoid fever. Linton was managed by the notorious Choppy Warburton - see 1896 below. The story may be apocryphal.\n1890s.\n1896.\nNitroglycerine was used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and was credited with improving riders' breathing. Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion Major Taylor refused to continue a New York race, saying: \"I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.\"\n1897.\nWarburton was banned from the sport after unproven claims of massive doping in the 1896 Bordeaux–Paris. His activities may have contributed to the early deaths of Arthur Linton, Tom Linton and Jimmy Michael.\n1930s.\n1930.\nThe acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930 that the rule book, distributed by Henri Desgrange, reminded riders that drugs would not be provided by the organisers.\n1960s.\n1962.\nThe Wiel's-Groene Leeuw affair – At the stage from Luchon to Carcassonne of the 1962 Tour de France, twelve riders fell ill and said 'bad fish' was the cause. Tour doctor Pierre Dumas realized they had all been given the same drug by the same soigneur. Hans Junkermann of Germany had been ill overnight so the start was delayed by 10 minutes, but at the first hill he got off his bike and sat by the roadside, telling onlookers \"I ate bad fish at the hotel last night.\" Eleven other riders abandoned the Tour that day, including the former leader, Willy Schroeders, the 1960 winner Gastone Nencini and a future leader, Karl-Heinz Kunde. Jacques Goddet wrote that he suspected doping but nothing was proven - other than that none of the hotels had served fish the previous night.\n1964.\nFrance passed its first anti-doping law in November 1964.\n1965.\nPerformance-enhancing drugs became illegal on 1 June 1965. The first riders to be caught were four amateurs, three Spanish (Luis Santamarina, Canet and Usamentiaga) and one Briton (Ken Hill), who were thrown out of the Milk Race when they tested positive for amphetamines after Professor Arnold Beckett first applied sensitive gas chromatographic techniques to monitor drug abuse.\n1966.\nOn 29 July testing began at the Tour de France. Raymond Poulidor was the first rider to be tested in the Tour at the end of a stage to Bordeaux. He said \"I was strolling down the corridor in ordinary clothes when I came across two guys who asked if I was a rider. They made me go into a room, I pissed into some bottles and they closed them without sealing them. Then they took my name, my date of birth, without asking for anything to check my identity. I could have been anyone, and they could have done anything they liked with the bottles.\" The next morning, on the way to the Pyrenees, the riders climbed off, began walking and shouting protests.\n1970s.\n1974.\nIn 1974, an advance in testing caught 13 prominent riders including Herman Van Springel.\n1979.\nDuring the 1979 Tour de France, the leader of the mountains classification Giovanni Battaglin tested positive for doping in stage 13. He was penalized by 10 minutes in the general classification, lost the points that he earned in stage 13 and received 10 penalty points in the mountains classification. Battaglin was still able to win the mountains classification.\nFrans Van Looy and Gilbert Chaumaz also tested positive for doping during the Tour. After the Tour de France had finished, Joop Zoetemelk was found to have used doping, which he confessed later. Zoetemelk was penalized by 10 minutes in the general classification, but kept his second place.\n1980s.\n1984.\nSystematic blood doping at the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The U.S. cycling team's successes were coloured by revelations that riders had blood transfusions before their events, a practice known as blood-doping. The transfusions were to increase red blood cells in riders' blood. That would take more oxygen to their muscles. They received the blood of others with similar blood types. The practice, instigated by national coach Eddie Borysewicz, was not against Olympic rules although Games medical guidelines discouraged it. Borysewicz and a colleague, Ed Burke, set up a clinic in a Los Angeles motel room and four of the seven athletes who had transfusions won medals. The U.S. federation banned blood-doping in January 1985. Borysewicz and Burke were fined a month's pay. Mike Fraysse, a former president of the federation, was demoted from first to third vice-president.\nRiders who received transfusions included Steve Hegg, who won a gold and a silver, and Rebecca Twigg, Pat McDonough and Leonard Nitz who all won silver medals. The others who received transfusions were John Beckman, Mark Whitehead and Brent Emery. The rest of the team had refused.\n1988.\nThe emergence of EPO - In the late 1980s a recombinant drug created for people suffering from kidney failure became a substance abused by athletes seeking enhanced stamina and performance. The drug is recombinant erythropoietin, known as EPO, which was developed by the Amgen company. Recombinant EPO is a bio-manufactured copy of a hormone normally produced in the kidney and was not detectable by any test at the time.\nEPO stimulates the bone marrow in order to increase red blood cell production and thus the body's ability to carry oxygen. A study of 15 Swedish athletes by the Stockholm Institute of Gymnastics and Sports found an improvement of nearly 10 percent in aerobic performance. \"Average\" red blood cell volume of the population at sea level is about 45% red blood cells. About 5% of the population has less than 40% red blood cell, which is defined as \"anemia\" and 5% of the population, including many world class athletes, have a natural red blood cells volume of 50%... 1% of the population has 54% red blood cell volume.\nThe increased thickness of the blood (above 70% red blood cells) increases the risk of blood clotting which can block blood vessels causing a heart attack or stroke, especially in the middle of the night when the heart's rate is lowest. Doctors and blood specialists concluded that the drug could have been implicated in the deaths of as many as 18 European professional bicycle racers between 1987 and 1991. One of them was Johannes Draaijer, a 27-year-old Dutch rider who finished 130th in the 1989 Tour de France, and died from a heart attack in February 1990. Although the autopsy did not specify the cause of death, Draaijer's wife later told the German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" that her husband became sick after using EPO.\n1990s.\n1990.\nThe PDM Affair, In November 1997, Cyclingnews.com reported about an inquiry that had just been made public in The Netherlands. This inquiry appeared to reveal doping in the PDM cycling team. The doctor of the team from between 1990 and 1991 was Wim Sanders who was the centre of the investigation which was reported to have been initiated when the General Manager of the team, Manfred Krikke, called the FIOD (Fiscal Information and Investigation Service) to investigate the medical business of the team. It was said that Wim Sanders supplied anabolic steroids and EPO to the team and was responsible for the \"intralipid affair\" of the 1991 Tour de France, when the entire team withdrew due to what was reported at the time as food poisoning. In a 2008 TV documentary; team members and team doctor Wim Sanders explain how the cause was in fact careless storage of Intralipid, a nutritional aid with which the team members had been injected.\nAccording to cyclingnews.com, 1990 was the height of the drug taking in the team and during this year, two riders had to stop with acute heart problems; whether this refers to stopping with professional cycling or performance-enhancing drugs is unclear. Team manager Gisbers denied any knowledge of doping in the team.\n1991.\nPDM. Some teams used sophisticated recovery techniques whereby riders were put on a drip during the night and fed nutrients such as Vitamin B12. This practice was blamed when the entire PDM team went down with a fever on the 10th Stage of the Tour de France. PDM management blamed a virus although only riders were infected. Ten days later a press release stated that the team had used recovery substances which were past their sell-by date.\n1996.\nThe Telekom Affair – In May 2007, several former riders admitted to using banned substances (including EPO) while riding for the team in the mid-1990s, including Erik Zabel, Rolf Aldag, Brian Holm, Bjarne Riis, Bert Dietz, Udo Bölts and Christian Henn including the seasons in which Riis and Jan Ullrich won the Tour de France. Team doctors Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich also confessed to participating and administering banned substances. The latter was Team Telekom's sporting director until 3 May 2007, when he was suspended following allegations published in former team member Jef d'Hont's book.\nOn 25 May 2007, Riis issued a statement confessing to taking EPO, growth hormone and cortisone for five years, from 1993 to 1998, including during his victory in the 1996 Tour de France. Earlier in the week, five of Riis' former teammates from Team Telekom confessed to having used banned substances during the 1990s when Riis won the Tour. Riis said that he bought and injected the EPO himself, and team coach Walter Godefroot turned a blind eye to the drug use on the team. Riis was removed from the official record books of Tour de France, but in July 2008 he was written back into the books along with additional notes about his use of doping.\n1998.\nThe Festina Affair is the events that surround several doping scandals, doping investigations and confessions of riders to doping that occurred during and shortly after the 1998 Tour de France. The affair began when a large haul of doping products was found in a car of the Festina cycling team just before the start of the race, which led to a large-scale police investigation against the Festina Team, this was followed by the re-opening of a separate police investigation case into the TVM team, and a subsequent searching of many teams during the race for possession of illicit doping substances. The affair highlighted systematic doping and suspicion of a widespread network of doping in many teams of the Tour de France, and was characterised by the constant negative publicity of the cases, police searches of hotels, a spate of confessions by retired and current riders to doping, the detainment and arrest of many team personnel, protests by riders in the race, as well as mass withdrawal of several teams from the race.\n1999.\n1999 Tour de France - In 2005 the French sports daily \"L'Équipe\" accused Lance Armstrong of using the performance-enhancing drug EPO during the race. For years, it had been impossible to detect the drug, called erythropoietin, until UCI began using a urine test for EPO in 2001. According to the newspaper, tests on 1999 urine samples were done to help scientists improve their detection methods. The newspaper said 12 samples had revealed EPO use, including six from Armstrong.\nIn 2006 a UCI appointed independent lawyer, Emile Vrijman, released a report in 2006 claiming that Lance Armstrong should be cleared of any suspicion surrounding the retrospective testing of the 1999 Tour de France. Vrijman denounced the manner in which the doping laboratory in Châtenay-Malabry carried out its research, claiming that there were too many procedural and chain of custody gaps. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rejected it, calling it \"defamatory\" to WADA and its officers and employees, as well as the accredited laboratory involved.\nIn that same year, a second French daily newspaper, \"Le Journal du Dimanche\", reported that Spanish rider Manuel Beltrán, Danish Bo Hamburger and Colombian Joaquim Castelblanco were suspected of being among those whose frozen urine samples reportedly tested positive.\n2000s.\n2001.\n2001 Giro d'Italia - The Giro was overshadowed by a series of scandals related to doping. Police raided the hotels of several teams during the race, uncovering a variety of banned substances. Italian Dario Frigo, who was fighting for the race lead at the time, was expelled from the race as a result. The week prior to the raid saw Pascal Hervé and Riccardo Forconi expelled from the race after testing positive for EPO. Italian police carried out anti-drugs raids on a number of hotels in the town of San Remo where the participants of the race were staying. About 200 officers were involved in the raid. Police officers search the rooms of riders from all 20 teams, confiscating medicines. The organizers decided to cancel the 18th stage after second-placed Dario Frigo was sacked by Fassa Bortolo team after illegal drugs were found in his room. Frigo later admitted carrying them as security in case he needed a boost during the final stages of the race. Italian Marco Pantani was banned for six months after an insulin syringe was found in his room. On appeal the ban was lifted.\n2003.\nOil for Drugs was an Italian doping case against doctor Carlo Santuccione and a number of accomplices, started in 2003. He was accused of administering prohibited doping products to professional and amateur athletes, to enhance their performance as well as being involved in doping network across Italy.\n2006.\n2006 Tour de France was marred by doping scandals. Prior to the tour, numerous riders - including the two favourites Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso - were expelled from the Tour due to their link with the Operación Puerto doping case. After the end of the race, the apparent winner Floyd Landis was found to have failed a drug test after stage 17; Landis contested the result and demanded arbitration. On 20 September 2007 Landis was found guilty and suspended retroactive to 30 January 2007 and stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title making Óscar Pereiro the title holder.\nOperación Puerto doping case (meaning \"Operation Mountain Pass\") is a Spanish doping case against doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and a number of accomplices, started in May 2006. He is accused of administering prohibited doping products to 200 professional athletes, to enhance their performance. Tour de France's favorites Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso were expelled from the Tour de France before the race started.\n2007.\nDoping cases.\n2007 Tour de France - The event was affected by a series of scandals and speculations related to doping. By the end of the Tour, two cyclists were dismissed for testing positive, the wearer of the yellow jersey, Michael Rasmussen was voluntarily retired by his team for lying about his whereabouts and missing doping tests. A fourth rider was confirmed to having used doping while in a training session prior to the 2007 Tour and a fifth rider tested positive late in the race, with his result being officially announced just after the end of the Tour. Along the way, two teams contesting the competition were asked to withdraw due to positive tests of at least one member."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England and Scotland in 2009",
        "text": "The Australia national cricket team toured Great Britain to play a series of cricket matches during the 2009 English cricket season. The team played five Test matches – one in Wales – seven One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals against England. The Australians also played four other first-class matches in England, against the England Lions and two county sides. Australia also took part in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 but they were eliminated in the first round after defeats to the West Indies and Sri Lanka.\nThe series of five Test matches between England and Australia was for The Ashes and, for the first time, a Test match was held in the capital of Wales, Cardiff. Australia was the holder of The Ashes trophy, having won the 2006–07 series 5–0. England won the last series to be held in England in 2005 and won the 2009 Ashes 2–1. The Twenty20 International series was drawn 0–0 as bad weather meant that neither match produced a result.\nMatches.\nFirst class matches.\nTour matches.\nAustralians v Sussex.\nThe match was notable for the success of Pepler Sandri, a South African-born fast bowler of Italian ancestry, who took three key wickets on the first day.\nNeeding 418 in their final innings to win, the Sussex batsmen came within 37 runs of this total before time was called with three wickets remaining. Carl Hopkinson was the highest scorer, achieving 115 runs from 172 deliveries.\nAustralians v England Lions.\nBrett Lee sustained a rib injury during the preparatory match against the England Lions which prevented him from playing any part in the Test series.\nThe Ashes.\nThe 2009 Ashes series was held from 8 July to 23 August 2009 at five grounds in England and Wales. The first Test, held at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff – itself hosting its first ever Test match – finished in a draw, while the second Test at London's Lord's Cricket Ground resulted in a 115-run victory for England after they had bowled Australia out for 215 in their first innings. Andrew Flintoff, who had announced his impending retirement from Test cricket prior to the Lord's Test, took five wickets in the second innings to secure the victory.\nThe rain-affected third Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham also finished in a draw, but a batting collapse brought about by immaculate bowling in the fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds meant that England were dismissed for 102 and ended up losing by an innings and 80 runs. That result took the series to a final, deciding Test at The Oval back in London.\nEngland reached 332 all out in their first innings, and then skittled the Australians for 160 on the second day, with Stuart Broad taking five wickets. A total of 373/9 declared, including a maiden Test century from Jonathan Trott, meant that Australia were set a target of 546 runs with two days left to play. All ten wickets came on the fourth day of the match, and despite a knock of 121 for Michael Hussey, Australia's response of 348 meant that they fell 197 runs short and England won the series 2–1.\nLimited overs matches.\nAfter the Test series, Australia played one One Day International against Scotland before embarking on a two-match Twenty20 International series and a seven-match One Day International series against England. They won the match against Scotland by 189 runs, but the Twenty20 series against England was drawn 0–0 as both matches were affected by rain and produced no results. The ODI series is scheduled to begin on 4 September 2009.\nScotland v Australia.\nAustralia began their series of One Day International and Twenty20 International matches with a warm-up match against Scotland. Scotland won the toss, but chose to field, a decision that Australia made them regret with a total of 345 all out off their 50 overs. Opener Shane Watson and middle-order batsman Adam Voges both made half-centuries, but the total was bolstered by David Hussey's 111 runs off 83 balls, an innings that included five sixes. Scotland's Gordon Goudie took five wickets, only the second Scottish player to manage such a feat in One Day Internationals. Scotland responded by posting 51 runs for their first wicket within 10 overs, but they lost another three wickets before reaching their ton. They were eventually bowled out for 156 in 39.3 overs, with Gavin Hamilton top-scoring with 38 off 50 balls, meaning that Australia won by 189 runs.\nTwenty20 series.\nThe Twenty20 International series began on 30 August 2009 at Old Trafford, Manchester. England won the toss and captain Paul Collingwood chose to field first. The Australian first wicket lasted until the sixth over, when Shane Watson was caught by Ravi Bopara off Stuart Broad. David Warner was then trapped LBW by Paul Collingwood for 33 runs in the ninth over, and David Hussey lasted just two balls before being stumped by Matt Prior for a duck, again off Collingwood's bowling. However, Australia added 78 runs for their fourth wicket, Cameron White totalling 55 runs – including three sixes – before being caught by Collingwood off Broad. This left them at 132/4, with 11 balls left, in which Adam Voges scored 11 to take the tourists to 145/4 at the end of their 20 overs. As the England openers came to the crease, Bopara got off strike with the second ball, leaving T20I debutant Joe Denly to face Brett Lee. The Australian bowler pitched the ball short, and Denly managed to get his bat to it, only to top-edge to Nathan Hauritz at short square leg for a debut golden duck. Bopara himself was out with his next ball, the first of the second over, but rain called a halt to proceedings at that point, and England were saved from a looming defeat.\nHeavy rain prevented the start of the second T20I, with the umpires inspecting the pitch twice before deciding to abandon the match. Although the majority of the field was suitable for play, a small patch of turf at the Brian Statham End where the bowlers would have made their run-ups remained soft under foot, and the umpires and the captains made the determination that it would have been unsafe for play to commence.\nNatWest series.\nThe England's captain, Andrew Strauss, won the toss and elected to field first. In the first innings Australia scored 260 for 5, Cameron White and Callum Ferguson scored half centuries, the highest score for both. In the second innings Strauss fell soon with only 12 runs, but Ravi Bopara scored 49 runs. In the 9th wicket Ryan Sidebottom and Adil Rashid scored 27 runs in 14 balls, but they need 32 for the victory.\nEngland won the toss, and Andrew Strauss chose to field. Callum Ferguson again scored a half century. Australia closed the innings with 249 for 8. In the second innings England opened with 74 runs in the first wicket (Ravi Bopara 27 and Andrew Strauss 44), but the next 9 wickets only scored 136 runs, and finally England lose the game but 39 runs. Paul Collingwood reached 4,000 runs in ODI (5th Englishman), and scored his 22nd Half century.\nAndrew Strauss won the toss for third time in the series, and elected to bat. Strauss scored 63 runs, his 17th half century, England scored 229 for 9. Cameron White scored his first century, and Michael Clarke his 36th half century. Both scored 143 runs in the 3rd wicket (Clarke 52 runs and White 86 runs), Clarke was bowled by Graeme Swann. Finally Australia reached the target with 6 wickets and 9 balls remaining.\nRicky Ponting returned as Australian captain. Strauss won for fourth time the toss, and chose bat. Andrew Strauss opened with 63 runs, his 18th half century. Brett Lee took 5 wickets by 9th time in his career. England scored 220 in 46.3 overs. In the second innings Tim Paine scored his first half century, and Michael Clarke his 37th. Australia reached the target with only 3 wickets, and won the series.\nEngland won the toss, and Strauss elected bat. England open with Strauss (35) and Denly (45), but Eoin Morgan scored 58 runs, making his 6th half century. England finally scored 299. In the Second innings the openers Watson (36) and Paine (16) fell soon in the match (9th and 15th over), but Ricky Ponting scored his highest score vs England 126 runs off 109 balls (27th century), and Michael Clarke scored 52 runs (38th half century). Mitchell Johnson scored a six for the victory with 10 balls remaining."

        "text": "John Frederick \"Jack\" Williams (18 November 188228 August 1911) was a Welsh international rugby union lock who played club rugby for London Welsh. He won four caps for Wales between 1905 and 1906 and most notably was a member of the winning Welsh team in the famous \"Match of the Century\" against the original All Blacks.\nInternational career.\nOf all the Welsh players who played in the 1905 \"Match of the Century\" \"Champions of the World\" team, Williams is the most enigmatic. Over his career he achieved by far the lowest number of international caps out of the 1905 team and played the majority of his career outside Wales. It was said that Williams was a good kicker of the ball and \"could pick up like a half, pass like a centre and run like a wing\". During his club career with London Welsh he captained the club during the 1907/08 season.\nWilliams began playing rugby while in school at Christ College, Brecon. After moving to London, he joined Welsh exile club London Welsh, also turning out for English side Richmond. Williams made his international debut against Ireland on 11 March 1905 while playing for London Welsh. He was chosen for the 1905 All Blacks game and he proved an excellent choice working well with Harding and Hodges to back up Dai Jones in the pack and line out. Williams short international career ended in the disastrous 1906 South African game, where dissent surrounding the pack resulted in a Welsh team without cohesion. The selectors decided a 'clean sweep' was required and very few of that team, including Williams, played for Wales again.\nIn 1908 Williams was chosen to join Harding's Anglo-Welsh team who toured Australia and New Zealand.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nLater career and death.\nIn 1910, Williams was sent to Northern Nigeria, by the Colonial Office to work in the capacity of a commissioner. It was recorded in \"The Sportsman\" that shortly after assuming his post, Williams was shot by a local. The paper went on to state that Williams had recovered from the bullet wound, and that the shooting had been an accident. Williams died the next year, at the age of 28, after contracting blackwater fever in Nigeria while on Colonial Service."

        "title": "1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe",
        "text": "The 1906–07 South Africa tour of Europe was a collection of friendly rugby union games undertaken by the South Africa national team against the four British Home Nation teams. The tour also took in several matches against British and Irish club, county and invitational teams before finally travelling to France to play the national team.\nThis was the inaugural South Africa tour and is recognised as the event that coined the phrase \"Springboks\" as a nickname for the South African team. The sports-themed South African novelty song \"The Springboks' Waltz\" was released in 1906 to commemorate the tour.\nThe 1906 Springboks were \"the first national team to utilize the 3–4–1 formation\".\nThe tour was extremely successful for the South Africans which helped garner respect from the Northern Hemisphere teams and established South Africa as a formidable rugby playing country. In the tests played the team would only lose to Scotland and drew against England. The South African defeat of Wales was a shock to many critics and ended the international careers of some of the greatest Welsh players of the time. Out of 29 matches played, South Africa won 26, lost two and drew one.\nMatch summary.\nComplete list of matches played by the \"Springboks\" in Europe:\n Test matches\nMatch details.\nWales.\nBefore the game hopes were high that the Welsh would be able to see off the South African threat. As one commentator wrote, \"There was nothing in the South African's play to forbid Welsh hopes of repeating their success of last season...\", harking back to Wales' famous victory over the All Blacks. When a Glamorgan XV team, which contained many Welsh caps that were to face South Africa, could only manage a drew against Gloucester, it caused some people to re-think the team's chances of winning. This caused an outcry for Welsh star, Gwyn Nicholls, to come out of international retirement to face South Africa. Even the South African players' voiced their disappointment at not facing Nicholls on the pitch. When Billy Trew withdrew from the Glamorgan XV against Monmouthshire on 22 November, Nicholls was the surprise replacement, and a few days later Nicholls told the \"Daily Mirror\" that he intended to \"have a shot at the Springboks\"\nOn the day of the match, South Africa were without some of their star players, including lead try scorer Stegmann, who had suffered a leg strain in the Belfast encounter. However, captain and talisman Paul Roos was back in the squad though sporting a heavy pad on his injured shoulder. The weather on the day was dry and the hard pitch suited the visitors. After an aggressive but blunt opening from the hosts, the South Africans found their pace and quickly took advantage. By half time the tourist were 6–0 ahead with tries from Joubert and Loubser. Gwyn Nicholls had a particularly poor game, wasting a panicked kick from Marsberg in the first half and throughout the game he and Gabe were so tightly marked that they were ineffective. In the second half it was a Nicholls error that handed the Springboks their third try when he caught a high ball safely, only to release it into open play. 'Klondyke' Raaff dribbled the ball away and scored a try that Joubert duly converted. The final result was 11–0 to the visitors; the majority of Welsh crowd were silenced by such a terrible result, though enough good-will was shown to carry captain Roos, and the constantly impressive Marsberg from the pitch.\nAfter the games there were many ramifications for the Welsh team. The papers stated that the weakness shown by the forwards, and too many old players in the pack, were the reasons for the poor Welsh display. The Welsh Rugby Union reacted to the press comments by dropping many of the players from international rugby. Those players that would never again represent their country included, Dai Jones, Will Joseph, Gwyn Nicholls and Jack Williams; just one year after the legendary game against the All Blacks.\nLlanelli.\nThe Springboks had a magnificent reception from a crowd of 15,000. The South Africans started on an attack, but the Llanelli forwards soon rallied, resulting in a try that placed the Welshmen ahead. For the remainder of the first half the Springboks persistently pressed, eventually succeeding in piercing the Welsh defence, resulting in a converted try.\nThe Springboks were leading 5 to 3 at the interval. After the start of the second half the Welsh made a determined effort, but the Springboks forwards gained supremacy which they maintained. Towards the end of the game the Springbok scored with a succession of backline movements, resulting in two tries for Loubser. One of these tries was converted and a penalty goal was added, for the 16 to 3 final score."

In his 4 years with the Titans, he scored 1,961 points, in 116 games (16.9 points per game), making him the school's all-time leader in total points scored, at the time.\nProfessional career.\nEarly years.\nBrown left Cal State Fullerton in 2007, but ultimately went undrafted in the 2007 NBA draft. He signed with the German team ALBA Berlin in August 2007, whom he helped win the German national domestic league. He was also a participant in a five-overtime European second-tier level EuroCup game, in which he top-scored with 44 points, the second-highest total ever in the competition.\nFirst NBA stint.\nIn 2008, Brown returned to the U.S., and played for the New Orleans Hornets in the NBA Summer League, with his highlight being a game-winning shot against the Charlotte Bobcats, in a 77–75 win. He was rewarded for his stellar summer league play, by his being offered a two-year contract with the Sacramento Kings, one of a handful of NBA teams that courted him. He was also pursued by multiple overseas teams that had offered him lucrative deals, among them the Israeli league's Maccabi Tel Aviv. He also came close to accepting a multi-year contract, \"in the millions\", from the Spanish league's FC Barcelona.\nOn February 19, 2009, Brown was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, along with Shelden Williams, in exchange for Rashad McCants and Calvin Booth. On September 9, he was traded to the New Orleans Hornets, along with Darius Songaila, in exchange for Antonio Daniels, and a 2014 second round pick. On January 26, 2010, Brown was again traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, for a conditional 2014 2nd round pick and cash considerations.\nIn July 2010, Brown joined the Toronto Raptors for the 2010 NBA Summer League.\nReturn to Europe.\nOn September 22, 2010, Brown signed with the Polish League team Asseco Prokom, but he was released in December, due to poor performances in the EuroLeague. In his first EuroLeague season, he averaged 10.7 points in 26 minutes per game, over six games, with Asseco Prokom, but shot only .333 percent from the field. On December 3, 2010, he signed a two-month contract with the Greek League club Aris, in order to replace Pierre Pierce, who was sidelined for two months with an injury. In 35 games, he averaged 12.2 points, 2.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 0.8 steals in 28.7 minutes.\nOn August 5, 2011, Brown signed with the German League team EWE Baskets Oldenburg.\nMontepaschi Siena.\nOn August 8, 2012, Brown signed a one-year contract with the Italian League team Montepaschi Siena.

On December 27, 2013, he scored 74 points in a 137–135 overtime victory over the Sichuan Blue Whales. Brown had scored the second-highest number of points in a single-game in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA)'s history, being just one point shy from breaking the record of 75 points scored, that was held by Quincy Douby, and which has since been eclipsed by Errick McCollum's 82 point effort, on January 30, 2015.\nOn May 22, 2014, Brown extended his contract with Dongguan, for three more years.\nBeşiktaş Sompo Japan.\nOn March 28, 2016, Brown signed with Beşiktaş Sompo Japan of Turkey, for the rest of the Turkish Super League's 2015–16 season.\nReturn to the NBA.\nOn September 23, 2016, Brown signed with the Houston Rockets.

He rocketed to an unexpected triumph in a new Olympic record of 21.30, then the second-fastest in history, powering past the field by 0.15 of a second, a sizable chunk in Olympic swimming's shortest race. The French tandem of Amaury Leveaux and Alain Bernard took home the silver and bronze with respective times of 21.45 and 21.49.\nAustralia's Ashley Callus finished fourth in 21.62, while his teammate and world record holder Eamon Sullivan was a fraction behind the leading pack in sixth at 21.65. For the first time in Olympic history, no American swimmer had reached the podium in the event, as the reigning world champion Ben Wildman-Tobriner, swimming on the outside in lane eight, pulled off a fifth-place effort in 21.64. Competing at their third Olympics, South Africa's Roland Mark Schoeman (21.67) and Sweden's Stefan Nystrand (21.72) rounded out the finale in seventh and eighth place, respectively.\nEarlier in the prelims, Cielo posted a time of 21.47 to erase Alexander Popov's 1992 Olympic record by 0.44 of a second. One heat later, Leveaux established the same record by winning the twelfth heat in 21.46. The following morning, in the semifinals, Cielo lowered again an Olympic record to 21.34 that had been set by Leveaux in the preliminaries under 0.12 seconds.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following Olympic records were set during this competition.\nQualification.\nThe A standard for the event was 22.35 seconds.

He played club rugby for Swansea and county rugby for Glamorgan.\nJoseph was seen as the outstanding forward of the early 20th century Swansea team, during an excellent period in the 'All Whites' history. He was recognised as a strong player in tight scrums and due to his height, excellent in line outs.\nInternational career.\nWales.\nJoseph made his debut for Wales against England at Blackheath in 1902 at the age of 23. Joseph played in three Triple Crown winning campaigns, but his greatest moment on the field was when he played against the touring 1905 All Blacks in the famous \"Match of the Century\". Joseph's international career fell apart in 1906 after a match against the touring Springboks. Although having played with great merit in an earlier match against South Africa with county side Glamorgan; in which he scored a try, Joseph was dropped after the international game. The Welsh pack in that game was dreadful and the selection committee decided to change the entire Welsh pack, regardless of individual play. Joseph's Wales career ended after 16 caps at the age of 28."

        "title": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships",
        "text": "The Artistic Gymnastics World Championships are the world championships for artistic gymnastics governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). The first edition of the championships was held in 1903, exclusively for male gymnasts. Since the tenth edition of the tournament, in 1934, women's events are held together with men's events.\nThe FIG was founded in 1881 and was originally entitled FEG (Fédération Européenne de Gymnastique), but changed its name in 1921, becoming the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG); this name change roughly correlates with the actual naming of the World Championships. Although the first such games were held in 1903, they were not initially entitled the 'World Championships'. The first competition ever actually referred to as a 'World Championships' was a competition held in 1931 that, while referred to in an official FIG publication as the \"First Artistic Men's World Championships\", often seems to go ignored by various authorities in the sport. The championships prior to the 1930s, beginning back in 1903, would eventually be recognized, retroactively, as the World Championships.\nAlthough the FIG had changed its name from the FEG back in 1921, the true transcontinental nature of the sport would not start to change at the World Championship level until a substantially later time. Perhaps the first non-European delegation to participate at a World Championships was Mexico, which sent a men's team who travelled all the way to compete at the 1934 Worlds in Budapest, a trans-Atlantic endeavor they repeated at the 1948 London Summer Olympics - a rare non-European delegation appearance even 14 years later. \nIt was at those same 1934 World Championships in Budapest that there was finally the first-ever women's competition at a world championships, despite women having participated in various world championships since the first such international competition in 1903. \nPerhaps the first African contingent was the Egyptian one which offered forth a full male team at the 1950 World Championships in Basel. By the time of these World Championships, a total of 60 male athletes from 6 countries and 53 female athletes from 7 countries comprised the competitive field. By the 2013 World Championships, the competition had grown to include 264 men from 71 countries and 134 women from 57 countries. As of 2023, over fifty editions of the championships have been staged, and over fifty countries have earned medals in artistic gymnastics events.\nThe most successful nation, both in gold medal results and total number of medals, is the former Soviet Union (not including medals from its successor states), and China is the second. The United States is the third most successful country in gold medal results while Japan is the third in total number of medals. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, the traditional powerhouses in men's and women's individual still had expressive results: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, China, United States, Japan, and Romania. The last two decades were marked by increasing results from two emerging powers: Great Britain and Brazil and at the same period a big decrease in results from Belarus, Romania and Ukraine. After a busy schedule and some tests which led to the holding of two separate world championships in 1994 (one for individual events and one for teams), it was decided that in each Olympic year the championship would not be held and that the edition held in the subsequent year of the Games, only the competition individual would be held. However, this cycle was broken in 2021,when the COVID-19 pandemic led to the 2020 Summer Olympics to be delayed by one year, the edition scheduled for that year was not cancelled. While the Games were held between July to August 2021, the World Championships was allocated to the end of the same year.\nAll-time medal table.\nLast updated after the 2023 World Championships.\nStatistics.\nMultiple gold medalists.\nBoldface denotes active artistic gymnasts and highest medal count among all artistic gymnasts (including those not included in these tables) per type.\nWomen.\nIndividual events.\nFew non-primary sources state that at the 1938 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, in Prague, Vlasta Děkanová of Czechoslovakia won 2 or 3 golds on multiple apparatuses. According to some sources, Děkanová and her compatriot Matylda Pálfyová shared gold medals in parallel bars (this event was replaced with uneven bars in the women's program at all subsequent world championships), while others state that Pálfyová shared this victory with Polish gymnast Marta Majowska, not Děkanová.

        "title": "1993 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race",
        "text": "The 1993 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, sponsored by Kodak, was the 49th annual running of the Australian \"blue water classic\" Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. It was hosted by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia based in Sydney.\nThe 1993 race, as in every year, began on Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), at noon on Boxing Day (26 December 1993) before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170 km) through the Tasman Sea, past Bass Strait into Storm Bay and up the Derwent River to cross the finish line in Hobart, Tasmania.\n\"While racing the distance of 630 nautical miles (the equivalent of over 1100 kilometres) under sail is in itself daunting, the unpredictable and often treacherous seas encountered, particularly in crossing Bass Strait make the Sydney-Hobart one of ocean racing's classic challenges. ----- it is the toughest middle distance ocean race in the world. ----- In yachting circles, a sailor who has 'done the Hobart race' commands considerable respect\"\n Those that survived and completed the 93 Hobart deserve mention.\nRace calamity.\nThe 1993 fleet comprised 104 starters. Of those 104 starters, only 38 of them completed the race due to severe weather conditions which struck the fleet near the south-eastern Australian coast as they entered Bass Strait at night. This race was arguably the toughest in recent history as the lowest number of completing yachts attests as does a staggering attrition rate. Fortunately there were no fatalities (in contrast to the 1998 yacht race, in which six died).\nAn unusually strong low pressure depression of 986 hpa developed, that a CSIRO Oceanography satellite photograph (unusual at the time) revealed as a spiral cloud stretching down the Queensland coast across the Tasman Sea to the south island of New Zealand back across to Tasmania and corkscrewing in to the storm center in Bass Strait, where the fleet were centred. The weather built into an exceptionally strong storm (which had similar strength winds to a lower-category hurricane reaching up to 70 knots and estimated 12-meter seas, resulting in two yachts abandoned and a man overboard incident. Additionally a record 66 yachts retired from the race or sank. The winning yacht \"Ninety Seven\" recorded of wind either side of the eye of the low off Gabo Island on the night of 27 December.\nThe April/May 1994 edition of \"Offshore\" (the official journal of CYCA) contained articles in a retrospective analysis of the 1993 Hobart race. David Lyons, the designer and crew aboard \"Cuckoos Nest\", the IMS handicap winner, made the following personal comment, when asked why so many yachts had failed to complete, he said; 1. Yacht structural designs being inadequate for the conditions. 2. A misunderstanding of ABS approval processes. 3. Refined rig designs that fail to meet the race loads. 4. Poor maintenance. 5. Yachts pushed beyond design limits. 6. Crews retiring due to own limitations when tired and seasick, which goes to adequacy of experience.\nIn an article on helmsmanship during the race, John Gray, an AYF Offshore Yachtmaster aboard \"Sea-U-Later\", a 12m admirals cup yacht, described how they discovered only 3 out of 8 crew were capable of helming in those conditions at night, without endangering the boat or crew, and then for only one hour at a time. Early recognition of this and altering watches to cater was central to their survival and completion of the race. Only one of the three had previous Hobart experience, but all three were seasoned offshore racers.\nThey were also critical of the races on water weather forecasting, which during the three days of storm, did not alter its forecast for a following SE wind change, which never eventuated. But probably lured yachts further south and away from Tasmania than necessary before tacking due west to close the coast. \"Sea-U-Later\" along with other yachts tracked down the 151-degree east longitude, becoming becalmed for 20 hours around 42 degrees south, in the centre of the weakened low, that all weather reports had said had moved well into the Tasman Sea. Whilst a respite the delay cost them dearly, Sea-U-Later was 37th to complete the race. The official explanation of the meteorology during the period was in the same edition, but somehow this was not communicated to yachts at sea at the time.\nAs a response to the record retirement rate the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia issued an extensive questionnaire to yacht owners seeking comment on suitability of storm sails, adequacy of radio communications and suitability of CYCA's standard safety equipment. They were also asked to comment \"\"As a result of your experience in this race is there anything you would do before starting, in say, the 1994 race to lessen the possibility of retiring should the same weather and sea conditions be anticipated'’\".\nIn the 1993 \"Offshore\" race issue the CYCA had been \"predicting a massive fleet of 200 yachts from around the world to mark this nautical milestone in yachting history\" (the 50th anniversary race). The commodores message expanded, \" I hope that all owners and skippers will back up again at the end of 1994 to make the 50th. Anniversary bash to Hobart one of the largest long ocean race fleets in the history of yachting, we believe a fleet in excess of 200 yachts is highly likely.\"\nAs the official Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race records now show, there were 371 starters and 309 finishers in 1994. It was not until 1998 that similar weather conditions returned with devastating results. Some of the lessons of 1993 had apparently not been learnt. has been the occasion for many sailboat capsizes, turtlings and fatalities.\nRace progress.\nThe race began with an enticing spinnaker run, once out of the Sydney Heads increasing to about for the first 8 hours until around Port Kembla. There was a south bound current running at about off the NSW coast so when the southerly change came through it raised peaky seas and as the effect of the low increased the waves had no backs in them. South westers that had been blowing in Bass strait for several days cancelling the start of the Melbourne to Tasmania yacht races, had lumped up big seas that awaited the Hobart yachts. Through 27 December, the day after the start 29 boats retired, two of them abandoned sinking and a man lost overboard after the webbing of his harness snapped. Many yachts broke off racing to answer flares and three Mayday distress calls, some of the drama of the race included;\nJohn Quinn 49 owner/skipper of the J/35 yacht MEM went overboard without lifejacket, about 11–30 pm when a wave flattened the yacht, and was miraculously rescued by an oil tanker the Ampol Sorrel who heard his crews radio call. In the dark of night in horrific conditions, they steamed to the search area then turned on a Searchlight and found him almost immediately. After being in the water 5 and ½ hrs He was picked up by the yacht Atari who had joined the search after losing her mast, and was nearby.\nThe crew of Adjuster abandoned her in sinking condition for the life raft which overturned and they spent the last hour clinging to it before rescue by Kingurra. The yacht Clwyd was swamped and eventually overturned when the keel fell off, the crew were rescued by Nynja Go then transferred to the radio relay vessel. The NZ yacht Swuzzlebubble VIII was rolled 360 degrees by a breaking wave, turtled, dismasted and swamped. On deck crew harnessed on were all recovered. The crew then cut the rig off, put out a No 3 headsil as a sea anchor and bailed her out while other yachts stood nearby. They managed to start the engine and motored into Eden. Meanwhile, Prime Factor of Adelaide came off a big wave at speed when the mast and the main bulkhead to which it was fastened pulled straight out of the deck of the boat and disappeared over the side. Two crew members of Advantaged were injured when the yacht capsized, snapping the mast off at the base, four crew were flung overboard but quickly recovered. The navigator was thrown through a bulkhead, head first. On Atara the mast slammed through the port side and it began taking water, but reached Eden where many sought shelter and carried out repairs. Brindabella a new Jutson 75 was retired with delamination at the bow, possibly after hitting a whale. By the end of 28 December 56 yachts had retired, a further 11 by the 30th see list below. At least one of the smallest yachts sheltered in NSW ports during the worst conditions and managed to complete the race within time.\nThis left Ninety Seven out in front with Cuckoos Nest a 40 footer crossing tacks during the race several times, Ninety seven eventually crossed 2 hours and 1 minute ahead of her rival. The IOR winner was Wild Oats.\nFleet.\nOnly 38 of the 104 yachts which started in the 1993 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race finished. These yachts are listed below:\nRetirements.\nThe following is known of the 66 other yachts (listed in order of retirement date) that started but did not finish:"

The modern game started in China in the mid 1970s. The team has since developed its talent with some overseas Chinese players became eligible to play for the team after 3 years of residence. This is evident in players such as Tim Tsung, who arrived from England 5 years ago and played for the English U16 National team for 3 years (he was signed by the national team and made his debut after a series of successful training sessions and friendly matches)."

        "text": "The NCAA Men's Basketball All-American teams are teams made up of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball players voted the best in the country by a variety of organizations.\nHistory.\nAll-America teams in college basketball were first named by both \"College Humor\" magazine and the Christy Walsh Syndicate in 1929. In 1932, the Converse shoe company began publishing All-America teams in their yearly \"Converse Basketball Yearbook,\" and continued doing so until they ceased publication of the yearbook in 1983. The Helms Athletic Foundation, created in 1936, retroactively named All-America teams for years 1905–35, and also continued naming teams until 1983. The Associated Press began naming its team selections in 1948.\nConsensus teams.\nWhile an increasing number of media outlets select All-America teams, the NCAA recognizes consensus All-America teams back to 1905. These teams have drawn from two to six major media sources over the years, and are intended to reflect the opinions of most college basketball experts. Today the four outlets used to select consensus teams are the Associated Press, the National Association of Basketball Coaches, the United States Basketball Writers Association and \"Sporting News\" magazine. Since 1984, the NCAA has applied a standardized point system to those teams designated as \"major\" All-American teams to determine consensus teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nTeams used to determine consensus selections.\nThrough the years, the following media outlets have been recognized and have been used to determine consensus teams. From 1905 to 1928, the Helms Athletic Foundation All-America teams are considered the \"official\" teams of those years by the NCAA.\nLeaders by school.\nThe top ten schools with the most consensus first-team All-Americans are listed below, ranked by total number of selections. For a complete list, please see the NCAA records.\nAcademic All-Americans.\nIn 1963, the first Academic All-American basketball team was named. The first team, selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA), consisted of: Rod Thorn of West Virginia, Ken Charlton of Colorado, Gerry Ward of Boston College, Art Becker of Arizona State and Ray Flynn of Providence. CoSIDA has named Academic All-America teams continuously each year since. For a complete list of first-team Academic All-Americans, please see the official NCAA records.\n\"Through 2020\"\nPreseason All-Americans.\nIn 1986, the Associated Press named the first preseason All-America team for the 1986–87 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Navy's David Robinson was the leading vote-getter that year. He was joined on the team by Steve Alford of Indiana, Danny Manning of Kansas, Kenny Smith of North Carolina and Pervis Ellison of Louisville. In 2011, Harrison Barnes of North Carolina became the first freshman voted a preseason All-American by the AP."

        "text": "The Florida Gators women's volleyball team represents the University of Florida in the sport of volleyball. The Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Gators play their home matches in the O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and are currently led by head coach Mary Wise.\nHistory.\nThe University of Florida's athletic department, the University Athletic Association, authorized the first intercollegiate varsity women's volleyball team to begin play in the fall of 1984. Marilyn McReavy was the Gators' first head coach, and she led the Gators volleyball team for seven seasons from 1984 to 1990. McReavy's Gators compiled an overall win–loss record of 156–100 (.609), and a Southeastern Conference (SEC) record of 26–20 (.565). Her best SEC finish was second place in 1988, and her 1987 team was the only one that qualified for the NCAA tournament. McReavy resigned after a 15–16 performance in 1990.\nCoach Mary Wise was hired to replace Marilyn McReavy in 1991. In their first year under Wise, the Gators won the SEC regular season championship, sharing it with the LSU Tigers volleyball team.\nIn 1992, Florida made its first ever NCAA Final Four appearance, where they lost in the semifinals to eventual national runner-up UCLA 15–12, 15–12, 15–10.\nIn 1993, Wise became the first Division I female head coach to guide her team to more than one final four. In 1996, the Gators made their trip to their third final four in five years, losing to Hawaii in the semifinals. Wise was named the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) Division I National Coach of the Year.\nIn 1997, the Gators appeared in the final four once again, being swept by Penn State in the semifinals. The roster consisted of a young squad, only have three seniors on the team.\nThe Gators made their third consecutive final four in 1998, where they again lost in the semifinals, to eventual national champion and undefeated Long Beach State, 15–2, 15–8, 15–10.\nIn 2002, Florida made their first final four appearance since 1998, defeating Temple in the Sweet 16 and Penn State in the Elite Eight, before falling to eventual national champion Southern California in the semifinals.\nAfter being 0-for-6 in previous NCAA Final Four semifinals, Florida broke through in 2003, by defeating Hawaii in the semis, 30–28, 30–28, 23–30, 30–28. Appearing in their first NCAA title match in school history, the Gators lost to undefeated Southern California in four sets, 25–30, 30–27, 30–19, 30–26. Wise became the first Division I female coach to coach in a championship match. In addition, Florida set a then-NCAA record of 105 straight games won during the 2003 season.\nThe Florida Gators opened the 2017 beating #1 Texas and #5 Nebraska in the opening weekend. They would eventually become the #1 ranked team...their first since 2010. The Gators finished the season 30-2 and reached their second final...falling to Nebraska 3–1. Rhamat Alhassan (1st Team), Carli Snyder (2nd Team), Shainah Joseph (2nd Team), and Rachael Kramer (3rd Team) would give Florida their highest total class of All-Americans in a single year in school history. Additionally, Mary Wise garnered the 2017 AVCA Coach of the Year for her third time...the second highest total in the award's history.\nIn 2023, the program's attendance record was set at 10,323 in attendance at the O'Connell Center when the 3rd ranked Gators played #1 Wisconsin. This also set the record for the highest attended volleyball match hosted by an SEC school and the highest on-campus volleyball match in the state of Florida.\nSoutheastern Conference.\nSoutheastern Conference Players of the Year.\nFlorida has 12 players selected SEC player of the year for a total of 18 awards.\nSoutheastern Conference Freshman of the Year.\nFlorida has 6 recipients of the Freshman of the Year award.\nSoutheastern Conference Libero of the Year.\nFlorida has 1 recipient of the Libero of the Year award.

        "text": "In digital image processing, morphological skeleton is a skeleton (or medial axis) representation of a shape or binary image, computed by means of morphological operators.\nMorphological skeletons are of two kinds: \nSkeleton by openings.\nLantuéjoul's formula.\nContinuous images.\nIn (Lantuéjoul 1977), Lantuéjoul derived the following morphological formula for the skeleton of a continuous binary image formula_1:\nwhere formula_3 and formula_4 are the morphological erosion and opening, respectively, formula_5 is an open ball of radius formula_6, and formula_7 is the closure of formula_8.\nDiscrete images.\nLet formula_9, formula_10, be a family of shapes, where \"B\" is a structuring element,\nThe variable \"n\" is called the \"size\" of the structuring element.\nLantuéjoul's formula has been discretized as follows. For a discrete binary image formula_13, the skeleton \"S(X)\" is the union of the skeleton subsets formula_14, formula_15, where:\nReconstruction from the skeleton.\nThe original shape \"X\" can be reconstructed from the set of skeleton subsets formula_14 as follows:\nPartial reconstructions can also be performed, leading to opened versions of the original shape:\nThe skeleton as the centers of the maximal disks.\nLet formula_20 be the translated version of formula_21 to the point \"z\", that is, formula_22.\nA shape formula_20 centered at \"z\" is called a maximal disk in a set \"A\" when:\nEach skeleton subset formula_27 consists of the centers of all maximal disks of size \"n\".\nPerforming Morphological Skeletonization on Images.\nMorphological Skeletonization can be considered as a controlled erosion process. This involves shrinking the image until the area of interest is 1 pixel wide. This can allow quick and accurate image processing on an otherwise large and memory intensive operation. A great example of using skeletonization on an image is processing fingerprints. This can be quickly accomplished using bwmorph; a built-in Matlab function which will implement the Skeletonization Morphology technique to the image. \nThe image to the right shows the extent of what skeleton morphology can accomplish. Given a partial image, it is possible to extract a much fuller picture. Properly pre-processing the image with a simple Auto Threshold grayscale to binary converter will give the skeletonization function an easier time thinning. The higher contrast ratio will allow the lines to joined in a more accurate manner.

He played for the Philadelphia White Stockings, Louisville Grays, Buffalo Bisons, Boston Red Caps/Beaneaters, Philadelphia Athletics, and Cleveland Blues.\nBorn in Philadelphia to Irish immigrant parents, Crowley worked for a print factory in Gloucester, New Jersey, before beginning his professional baseball career with the Philadelphia White Stockings in 1875. He was the youngest player in the National Association that year, having turned 18 just days before his debut. \nCrowley threw out four men from the outfield during a May 1880 game with the Buffalo Bisons, and he did it again in August of that year.\nIn 1881, Crowley was one of several players blacklisted from the National League by the league president, William Hulbert. The bans were thought to take aim at drunkenness, rowdy behavior and game fixing among the league's players, but all of the blacklisting was lumped under a broad category: \"general dissipation and insubordination.\" Crowley was reinstated in 1883. \nOn June 7, 1884, while Crowley was playing for the Boston Beaneaters, Providence Grays pitcher Charlie Sweeney struck out Crowley to end the game and to set a single-game major league strikeout record (19 strikeouts). That record was tied several times before Roger Clemens struck out 20 batters in a 1986 game. The rest of the 1884 season was better for Crowley, as he set career highs in games played, at bats, hits and runs batted in.\nCrowley's last season in the major leagues was an unpredictable one. He played 92 games for the 1885 Buffalo Bisons, a team that finished with a 38–74 win–loss record. In mid-September, the team was bought out by the Detroit Wolverines. Two days later, four of Crowley's teammates appeared in uniform for the Wolverines, but they did not play after the league threatened the Wolverines with a forfeit. The team's purchase was later reversed by the league. In the last three weeks of the season, the Bisons finished with no wins, sixteen losses and one tie.\nFrom 1886 to 1888, Crowley appeared with four minor league teams before leaving professional baseball. He died at the age of 34 of Bright's disease in Gloucester, New Jersey, and is interred at St. Mary's Cemetery in Bellmawr, New Jersey."

Through the years there have been new championships added and older championships dropped as social and sporting attitudes changed.\nTrack.\nUp to the late 1960s the distances for track championships were affected by economic factors. Combined athletic and cycling meetings were held in every part of the country and attracted large attendances, the outstanding cyclists of the day were household names. This led to the organisers of meetings demanding a championship (county, provincial or national) to attract bigger gates. The number of championships was increased to meet this demand and this has created difficulties in compiling these lists because one cannot be sure that the absence of a result for an event is due to lack of research or the fact that the event did not take place in a particular year. There were, of course, core distances that were regularly raced for many years. No matter what the motive for putting them on the calendar these championships were keenly contested and the winners are due as much respect as those who won the events that have persisted through the years.\nChampionships were raced on a mixture of hard surfaces and on grass depending on where they were held. Championships were not designated as grass track or hard track but rather as distances.\nAfter the late 1960s the \"local\" began to die in Ireland. Sports meetings faded out with showbands. People became less interested in going down the road to see local heroes when they could sit at home and look into the pores of the best competitors in the world on television. This brought a contraction in the number of track championships back to the core distances and disciplines.\nRoad.\nRoad racing was less affected by economics and fashion. Time trials have been a feature since the earliest days. It should be remembered that time trials became so popular in the United Kingdom because cycle racing on the open road was illegal. Riders wore sports jackets and tights as part of the strategy to avoid detection and prosecution. Once independence was achieved in part of Ireland time trialling escaped from these stifling rules and gradually massed start road racing became popular and championships were held.\nThe classic time trial distances were 25, 50 and 100 miles and 12 and 24 hours. From the early 1960s the longer events faded away. Although the 25 miles remained on the books there was sometimes a slight variation in the distance and out and home courses were not always used.\nMassed start championships for men were initially held at more than one distance each year but by the early 1960s settled into one event of at least 100 miles/160 km.\nCategories.\nRacing as recorded in Ireland was almost completely amateur and no professional stand-alone championships were ever held. When the Olympic Games abandoned the amateur ruling, cycling internationally adopted a system of over 23 Elite and under 23 with no distinction between amateurs and professionals.\nJunior racing.\nThe term \"Junior\" has had many meanings. At one time the gradings were Novice (who had not won 3 prizes), Junior (who had won 3 prizes) and Senior (who had gained a place in the first three in a Senior championship). Later \"Junior\" meant under 18 on a particular date. There were occasional \"Youths\" championships which at one time meant under 20 years on a specified date but this may not have been consistent.\nWomen's racing.\nWomen's racing goes back to at least the 1930s but only a small number of championships are recorded before the 1980s.\nOrganisations.\nAt various times there was more than one body organising cycling in Ireland and each promoted their own championship. These are all regarded as being of equal merit in this listing.\nThe overlaps are:\nOther external sources.\nInformation not referenced above was gleaned from:"

        "title": "Daniel Wells (snooker player)",
        "text": "Daniel Wells (born 31 July 1988) is a Welsh professional snooker player from Neath. He has twice come through Qualifying School to play on the professional snooker tour, and turned professional again at the beginning of the 2023–24 season after placing top of the 2022–23 One Year Ranking List for players outside the top 64, despite competing as an amateur for the entire season.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nHe was awarded the inaugural Paul Hunter Scholarship. This gave him the chance to practise in the World Snooker Academy in Sheffield, alongside professional players, such as Peter Ebdon and Ding Junhui.\nHe first qualified for the Main Tour for the 2008–09 season by finishing ranked fifth on the International Open Series rankings.\n2008/2009.\nHe had consistent results on his first spell on the main tour, winning his first qualifying match in most events, apart from defeat in the first qualifying round to Stefan Mazrocis in the Grand Prix. This was followed by a run to the penultimate qualifying round of the Bahrain Championship where he lost to veteran John Parrott 3–5.\nAn impressive run to the last 16 of the Masters Qualifying tournament included a 5–4 win over Crucible quarter-finalist Liang Wenbo. He followed this with a defeat to Li Hang in the first qualifying round of UK Championship 3–9.\nHowever, at the World Championship, Wells needed a good run of results to ensure his place on the tour for the following season. A sequence of 10–9 wins over Li Hang, Ian Preece and Marcus Campbell took him to the final qualifying round where he lost 9–10 to Barry Hawkins in the final qualifying match. In his 4 qualifying matches, he played the maximum 76 frames. His ranking rose to No. 70 as a result of his exploits that season.\n2009/2010.\nWells started the new season with a win over fellow Welshman Ian Preece 5–3 in the Shanghai Masters before losing to Joe Delaney in the next round by the same scoreline. In the UK Championship, he narrowly lost 8–9 to fellow Welshman Michael White. In his home championship, the Welsh Open, Wells narrowly lost in the first qualifying round to James Wattana 4–5. Another first qualifying round defeat in the China Open meant that Wells was again in danger of losing his place on the tour. Wells failed to repeat his exploits of the previous season in the World Championship as he lost 7–10 to former world No. 12 David Gray in the first qualifying round. This meant that he fell off the tour.\n2010/2011.\nDespite not being on the main tour during the 2010–11 season Wells entered many of the PTC and EPTC events, and recorded some impressive wins eventually finishing 29th on the Order of Merit. He regained a place on the main tour for 2011–12 by finishing top of the Welsh rankings.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12 Tour Players\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wells also won the European Snooker Championships and the European Team Championships (with team Wales).\n2011/2012.\nAs an unranked player on the tour Wells would need to win four qualifying matches to reach the main draw of the ranking events. However, he only won three matches during the season, including going without a single victory in the 11 of 12 Players Tour Championship events that he played.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season without a ranking and had to enter Q School in an attempt to earn a place on the tour for the 2012–13 season. In May, Wells won five matches at the second 2012 Q School event concluding with a 4–3 win over Michael Wasley to earn a place on the tour for the next two seasons.\n2012/2013.\nWells did not win two consecutive matches in qualifying for any of the ranking events in the 2012/2013 season, and therefore did not reach the main draw for any tournaments. He played in all ten Players Tour Championship events this season, with his best results being two last 64 defeats, to be placed 101st on the PTC Order of Merit. His season ended when he was beaten 7–10 by Aditya Mehta in the first round of World Championship Qualifying which saw him finish ranked world number 87.\n2013/2014.\nWells lost in the qualifying rounds of the first five ranking events in the 2013–14 season, but received automatic entry into the UK Championship as all 128 players began the tournament in the first round. It was here that Wells won the first match at a main venue for the first time in his career by defeating Alfie Burden 6–4, but he then lost 6–3 to Joe Perry.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The only event Wells qualified for this season was the German Masters, with an impressive 5–1 victory over Nigel Bond, before he was eliminated in the first round 5–1 by Gary Wilson. After Wells was beaten 10–7 by Kurt Maflin in the second round of World Championship qualifying he was ranked world number 100 meaning he could no longer reach the top 64 and was relegated from the tour. He played in the 2014 Q School in an attempt to regain his place and came closest to doing so in the second event when he lost in the last 16 to Ashley Carty.\n2014/2015.\nWells was back to being an amateur player for the 2014–15 season, but still considered himself as a professional as he was playing for his living. He faced Ronnie O'Sullivan in the first round of the UK Championship and, despite his opponent playing with a broken ankle, Wells was beaten 6–2. He lost 4–2 to Gerard Greene in the first round of the Welsh Open. Wells qualified for his first China Open by defeating Robbie Williams 5–3 and lost the last three frames in the first round against Graeme Dott to be eliminated 5–3. At the first event of the 2015 Q School he eliminated Alexander Ursenbacher 4–1 in the final round to earn a two-year tour card starting with the 2015–16 season.\n2015/2016.\nWells played in his first International Championship by beating Rory McLeod 6–1 and advanced through a wildcard round in China, before losing 6–4 to Lee Walker in the first round.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won three matches to reach the last 16 of the Bulgarian Open where he was eliminated 4–0 by Mike Dunn. He would finish 39th on the European Order of Merit. Wells saw off Rod Lawler 6–4 at the UK Championship, despite abandoning his car due to traffic and running to the venue before the match. He lost 6–3 to Ali Carter in the second round. Wells reached the same stage of the Welsh Open by beating Andrew Higginson 4–2, but was knocked out 4–1 by Marco Fu.\n2016/2017.\nWells began using a new cue at the beginning of the 2016–17 season and it proved to be his most successful year to date. He qualified for the World Open by thrashing Tian Pengfei 5–0 and then beat Xu Si 5–3, before recording another 5–0 whitewash this time over Kyren Wilson to reach the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time. After being 2–0 down to Ali Carter he moved 4–2 ahead, before missing chances to play in the quarter-finals and was defeated 5–4. Wells qualified for the International Championship by overcoming Mark Allen 6–5 and eliminated Stuart Carrington 6–2 in the first round, but then lost 6–5 to Michael Holt having been 5–3 up.\nA 6–5 win over Ian Burns at the UK Championship saw Wells face world number one Mark Selby in the second round. Wells was 3–1 ahead, but would be defeated 6–4. He advanced to the third round of both the Scottish Open and Gibraltar Open, losing 4–3 to Yu Delu and 4–0 to Nigel Bond respectively. Wells qualified for the China Open with a 5–3 victory over Marco Fu and reached the last 16 for the second time this season by beating Jamie Cope 5–3 and Matthew Stevens 5–2, but lost 5–1 to Stephen Maguire. Wells finished a season within the top 64 in the world rankings for the first time as he was number 62.\n2018/2019.\nHe advanced to the quarter-final of the Paul Hunter Classic losing 4–3 to Kyren Wilson. Wells reached the semifinal of a ranking tournament for the first time at the 2018 Scottish Open, and despite leading 4–0, and 5–2 over Mark Allen he lost 6–5. He advanced to the four round of both the English Open, Shoot-Out and Gibraltar Open, losing 4–3 to Ali Carter, 1–0 to Rod Lawler and 4–3 to David Gilbert respectively.\nOther.\nIn 2009 Wells recorded a series of snooker tutorial videos at the World Snooker Academy. These were launched as a subscription based online coaching program in February 2010 under the name of SnookerGuide.co.uk."

In the 1983/1984 season, he qualified for the semi-final group in the 1984 International Masters, recording a 2–1 victory over Alex Higgins in his qualifying group. In the 1984 World Championship, he defeated Tony Jones 10–9, Mike Watterson 10–8 and Dave Martin 10–8 to qualify for the televised stages at the Crucible Theatre; there, he was drawn against incumbent World Champion Steve Davis, but having held Davis to 2–2, he could not prevent a 3–10 loss.\nDuring the next season, King reached the final of the 1984 Australian Professional Championship, where he also lost 3–10, this time to Eddie Charlton, and followed this with a last-32 finish in the 1984 UK Championship, losing 5–9 to Dennis Taylor. In the 1985 Classic, he overcame Steve Duggan, Dean Reynolds, John Spencer and Jimmy White to reach the quarter-finals, losing there 1–5 to Joe Johnson.\nRanked 35th for the 1985/1986 season, King began it with another last-32 finish in the 1985 Matchroom Trophy, but had a quiet season thereafter; he came within one match of returning to the Crucible after beating Dessie Sheehan and Colin Roscoe in World Championship qualifying, but lost in the final round 7–10 to Reynolds.\nIn the 1986 Australian Professional Championship, King defeated Charlton in the semi-finals and John Campbell 10–3 in the final to record his first tournament win. After a solid season, he qualified for the 1987 World Championship, defeating David Roe, Ken Owers and Charlton all 10–4, but was again drawn to face Steve Davis. On this occasion, Davis raced into a 7–1 lead before King fought back to 8–7, but again Davis prevailed, 10–7.\nKing recorded his second tournament win in the 1987 Australian Professional Championship; Charlton was again his opponent in the final, and this time King won 10–7. He otherwise performed poorly in the ranking events, but qualified for a third time for the World Championship, notably overcoming Spencer in the final round. His opponent in the last 32 was rising star John Parrott, who beat him 10–4.\nA lean period ensued, but in the 1990 Classic, King produced his best form. Entering at the last-96 stage, he defeated Mario Morra 5–3, Terry Griffiths 5–1, Charlton 5–2, John Virgo 5–1, Steve Newbury 5–3 and Silvino Francisco 6–5 – having trailed 3–5 – to reach a ranking event final for the first time in his career. His opponent in the final was Steve James and the match closely run; having at various points led 4–1, 5–2 and 7–6, James pulled away to win 10–6. This performance earned King £36,000, and ensured he finished the season – having started it ranked 55th and in some danger – in a much more secure position, at 39th.\nThe 1990/1991 season finished on a positive note for King, as he qualified for the Crucible for the fourth time, straightforward wins over Jack Fitzmaurice, Rod Lawler and Barry West sealing his passage to the televised stage; however, he was drawn against a former or future World Champion for the fourth time – on this occasion, Stephen Hendry. King fared no better than in previous years, losing 4–10.\nIn 1991, the professional game was 'opened' to anybody who could pay a small fee; now in competition against several hundred more players on the main tour, King began to fade, his only last-32 result coming in the Dubai Classic, where Francisco's nephew Peter beat him 5–4. Losing his first match in qualifying for the World Championship 9–10 to Andrew Cairns, he finished the season ranked 67th.\nIn 1994, playing in the New South Wales Open Snooker Championship, King became the first Australian ever to make a maximum break in a tournament, which was also the first maximum break ever recorded in a tournament in Australia. King won a car for the break, and went on to win the tournament.\nBy the 1994/1995 season, King's ranking had fallen even further, to 114th. He played in only one tournament, the 1995 World Championship, but his career concluded with Tai Pichit whitewashing him 10–0. King did not play on the main tour again, deciding to focus more on a career in pool.\nAfter snooker.\nKing is Vice President of the Billiards and Snooker Association of South Australia."

        "text": "The Talking Cricket () is a fictional character that appears in the 1883 Italian book \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" (\"Le avventure di Pinocchio\") by Carlo Collodi.\nRole.\nThe Talking Cricket, who has lived in Geppetto's house for over a century, makes his first appearance in chapter IV. Pinocchio's mischief has landed his maker Geppetto in prison for the night, and the Talking Cricket insists that Pinocchio must either attend school or work to function properly in the world. When Pinocchio refuses to listen, the Cricket states, \"You are a puppet and what's worse is that you have a head of wood\", whereupon Pinocchio throws a mallet at the cricket, which kills him. \nIn chapter XIII, the Talking Cricket reappears as a ghost to Pinocchio, telling him to return home rather than keep an appointment with the Fox and the Cat (\"Il Gatto e la Volpe\"). Pinocchio refuses and in chapter XIV, he is subsequently injured.\nThe Talking Cricket's ghost reappears in chapter XVI, where he and his colleagues the Crow and the Owl tend to Pinocchio's injuries. While the Crow and the Owl argue over if Pinocchio is dead or alive, the Talking Cricket states that Pinocchio is fine and disobeyed his father.\nThe Talking Cricket makes his final appearance in chapter XXXVI, who has been resurrected and living in a house given to him by the Fairy with Turquoise Hair, where he allows Pinocchio and the ailing Geppetto to stay while Geppetto regains his health.\nFolklore.\nIn Florence, Italy, which was the birth place of Mr.Carlo Collodi, the author, there is a traditional festival every May. It is called , the festival of the cricket. Crickets are considered to be good luck in Florence, as well as many other parts of Europe and even throughout the world. Many traditional folk stories regarding the \"lucky\" crickets hold that crickets live for hundreds of years.\nCharles Dickens wrote a novella, inspired by this folklore, with The Cricket on the Hearth (1846). It is a novella which depicts the ideology behind the tradition of the lucky cricket, who is perpetually happy and emanates happiness wherever it goes."

        "text": "Since the establishment of the competition in 1903, eight Australians have led the general classification in the Tour de France at the end of a stage during one of the 102 Tours de France. \nOne of the three Grand Tours of professional stage road cycling, the Tour de France is the most famous road cycling event in the world, and is held annually in the month of July. Although all riders compete together, the winners of the Tour are divided into classifications, each best known by the coloured jersey that is worn by the leader of it; the general classification (GC), represented by the yellow jersey (French: \"maillot jaune\"), is for the overall leader in terms of the lowest time. The other individual classifications in the Tour de France are the points classification, also known as the sprinters' classification (green jersey), the mountains classification (polka dot jersey), and the young rider classification (white jersey).\nIn the 110 editions of the Tour de France to 2023, only eight Australian riders have worn the yellow jersey. The first was Phil Anderson, who in 1981 became the first ever non-European to lead the general classification at the Tour de France when he wore the yellow jersey on Stage 7 on 1 July. Of the eight Australians to wear it to date, four are considered to be \"general classification riders\" (that is, riders who are aiming to win the GC, as opposed to competing in another classification or riding as a \"domestique\"): Anderson in 1981 and 1982, Cadel Evans in 2008, 2010 and 2011, Simon Gerrans in 2013 and Jai Hindley in 2023. Stuart O'Grady and Robbie McEwen are sprint specialists, and were successful in the points classification competition in the years when they also wore the yellow jersey; as a result of winning stages early in the race, they received time bonuses which gave them the leadership of the GC for a small number of days early in the Tour. Brad McGee was the reigning world champion in the 4000 m individual pursuit when he won the opening prologue time trial, which was similar in length, in 2003. Simon Gerrans gained his Yellow Jersey after Orica–GreenEDGE's victory in the Stage 4 team time trial around Nice on 2 July 2013. Rohan Dennis, while a former hour record holder, was riding the Tour de France in support of Tejay van Garderen when he won the Stage 1 individual time trial in Utrecht on 4 July 2015, thus becoming the first leader of the general classification for the 2015 Tour de France.\nThe eight Australians have spent a total of 32 stages in the yellow jersey out of the 2,126 total in the 102 editions of the Tour de France, as at the end of Stage 1 of the 2015 Tour."

Ateneo finished first in the elimination round. They eliminated the Adamson Soaring Falcons, who are in their Final Four debut, in the semifinals. UST finished tied for third in the eliminations and had to beat the 2nd seed UE Red Warriors twice in order to qualify at the Finals.\n2005 losing finalists De La Salle Green Archers were suspended when it was revealed that two players used spurious documents to enter college. All of their wins from 2003 to 2005 were also forfeited. La Salle's suspension also caused the suspension of the 2005 juniors champions De La Salle Junior Archers. All La Salle teams would return in the 2007 season.\nPreseason events.\nIn a meeting held at Adamson University on April 21, 2006, the UAAP Board unanimously voted to suspend De La Salle from all UAAP events on both divisions for the 2006–2007 (69th) season due to negligence.\nNew coaches include the comebacking Joe Lipa for the UP Fighting Maroons, Leo Austria for the Adamson Falcons, and Pido Jarencio for the UST Growling Tigers.\nSince Joe Lipa was tapped as the new coach of UP, Elmer Yanga, former team manager of the RFM franchise in the Philippine Basketball Association, was chosen as the new basketball commissioner for the season.\nAll of the elimination's first-round games after Opening Day was held at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium in Malate, Manila.

The Final Four and the best-of-three Finals are set at the Big Dome as well.\nElimination round.\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nPostseason teams.\nAdamson make their first Final Four appearance since the format's first application in 1994. Ateneo and UE continue their streaks of playoff appearances, as UST returns after a three-year absence. The FEU Tamaraws were the first defending champions not to qualify for the semifinals.\nAteneo Blue Eagles.\nThe Eagles entered the season as one of the preseason favorites. After winning a nailbiter against lowly NU Bulldogs on Opening Day, the Eagles went on an 8-game winning streak, sweeping the first round, and surviving squeakers against Adamson and FEU, and blowing out UST by 36 points, 114–78 on the first round finale through a high scoring second quarter.\nThe second round was more of the same, when Ateneo again survived another 1-point game against the Falcons. However, they were dealt with their first setback in an overtime loss against the Growling Tigers, who were without three players due to injuries and ailments. Despite the loss, the Eagles were already assured of a twice-to-beat advantage at the semi-finals. They also dropped their last assignment, a no-bearing game against the Warriors at the last day of eliminations.\nUE Red Warriors.\nReturning with an intact lineup, the hosts also emerged as one of the preseason favorites. However, the first round was mixed, as they were beaten by UST and Ateneo, but they finished second.\nOn the second round, UE was unbeaten, winning four straight (including the last game of the first round). However, UE was beaten by Adamson in an overtime thriller. After UST's victory of Adamson in the first game, UE is now assured of a twice-to-beat advantage at the semifinals.\nUST Growling Tigers.\nThe Growling Tigers opened the season with a stunning loss against the UP Fighting Maroons on a buzzer-beater shot by Marvin Cruz. However, they beat the defending champions Far Eastern and top seeds East in two closely fought games. With setbacks against National, Adamson and a blowout loss against Ateneo, their Final Four aspirations were cast in doubt.\nSanto Tomas opened their second round with another loss against UE. But they broke the .500 barrier with successive wins against National, Far Eastern, and an overtime win against Ateneo. Flirting a possible twice-to-beat advantage at the semifinals, the Maroons dealt the Tigers another defeat. With their fates not in their hands, they've beaten the Soaring Falcons in a tightly contested game. With Ateneo's drubbing of Far Eastern, the Tigers entered the Final Four for the first time since 2002.\nAdamson Soaring Falcons.\nThe Falcons is the only team not to enter the men's Final Four since the league instituted it in 1994. Seeking to end the streak, the Falcons had their first win against the Bulldogs, after being demolished by the hosts in their opening game. But Adamson still faced a rocky ride, losing to top contenders, Ateneo and FEU but beating UP and UST to end the first round with an even 3–3 record.\nOpening the second round, Adamson was beaten again by FEU and Ateneo. But with center Ken Bono posting MVP numbers, Adamson brought itself in the hunt for that elusive Final Four berth. They were able to demolish UP and upset UE in overtime. They lost to UST before closing out the second round with a win over NU. With Ateneo's defeat of Far Eastern, Adamson barged outright into their first Final Four appearance.\nSemifinals.\nAteneo and UE have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\nAteneo vs. Adamson.\nThis was the Soaring Falcons' first Final Four appearance. Adamson gave Ateneo two one-point victories in the elimination round, with the Eagles escaping due to their endgame heroics.\nA see-saw game until the fourth quarter, when Ken Bono of the Falcons converting a three-point play with 18.3 seconds remaining, to cut the Ateneo lead to, 74–73. On the inbound pass, Blue Eagle Chris Tiu threw an errant pass to Macky Escalona who failed to retrieve it. On the next possession, Soaring Falcon Patrick Cabahug missed a fadeaway jumper, which led to an Atenean rebound. The Falcons left with no choice but to foul Chris Tiu, who calmly sank his two freethrows, thereby eliminating the Falcons from contention.\nUE vs. UST.\nSeason host was favored in this matchup, with several veterans in the lineup. The Tigers have no players with playoff experience, save for Jemal Vizcarra who was out of the season by the second game due to an Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.\nUST won the first game 91–77, while UE won the second game, 74–63 in the elimination round. UE's loss was the third time in tournament history where they were booted out of the semifinals armed with the twice-to-beat advantage (1994, 2002 and 2006). UE's last Finals appearance was on 1990.\nIn Game 1, UST led for much of the game, when the Warriors started making inroads by the third quarter. With 21.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, and with UST up by two points, June Cortez of UST converted a three-point play that gave the Growling Tigers enough breathing space to force a deciding elimination game.\nWith the Tigers off to a hot start in Game 2, the Warriors kept within striking distance. In the fourth quarter, the Warriors forced a 70-all deadlock - the first in the game. UE then led by as much as five points, but the Tigers fought back, forcing turnovers and grabbing offensive rebounds, to tie the score at 79-all. After a UE turnover, Jojo Duncil missed the shot, but Jervy Cruz grabbed the offensive rebound, missing the put-back; Duncil then tipped in the ball for a two-point field goal, plus a foul. Duncil completed the three-point play. On the next possession, UE's Marcy Arellano drove unmolested to the basket, cutting the lead into one point. With a UST turnover and several seconds remaining, Red Warrior Jorel Cañizares missed a medium-range jump shot. Cañizares grabbed his own rebound but missed on a short stab; Warriors team captain Robert Labagala grabbed the rebound as time expired.\nFinals.\nThe Growling Tigers and the Blue Eagles met each other for the first time in the UAAP Finals. The last time they met in the Finals was in the 1931 NCAA season, in which the Ateneo won.\nGame One.\nThe game was close all throughout, with neither team leading by double figures. It ended in the fourth quarter with two crucial plays. With 4.3 seconds to go, Tigers forward Allan Evangelista made a tough fadeaway shot over the outstreched arms of Doug Kramer, pushing UST ahead of Ateneo, 72–71, with 1 second to go.\nAteneo coach Norman Black immediately called a time-out over the tumultuous din of the rejoicing UST fans. In the inbound play, Macky Escalona found a wide open Kramer in the paint, and the Ateneo forward calmly banked the ball in for the win, sending the Ateneo fans, in turn, into a wild frenzy.\nGame Two.\nThe Eagles, although led early, were down by a point at the end of the first half. The Tigers broke the zone defense by hitting outside shots and by grabbing offensive rebounds off their misses. JC Intal kept the Eagles at striking distance but his supporting cast wasn't enough as the Tigers cruised into a Game 2 victory, and forced a winner-take-all Game 3.\nGame Three.\nWith a tightly contested first quarter, the Intal-Escalona connection of the Eagles threatened to pull away at the second quarter, leading by as much as ten. In the third quarter, the Tigers stormed back, keeping in touch with the Blue Eagles. In the dying minutes of the fourth quarter, rookie sensation Jervy Cruz fouled out with 1:16 left; Evangelista, the almost-hero of Game 1, fouled out two minutes earlier. With a 64–59 Ateneo lead, Anthony Espiritu scored a three-pointer on the UST offense. Mark Canlas scored a put-back to tie the game. Intal missed a short jumper at the other end for force overtime.\nWith the score tied 74-all, June Cortez missed a jumper; Dylan Ababou was fouled as he grabbed the rebound. Ababou split his charities, which led to another JC Intal miss in the final seconds. The rebound was hotly contested, and the referee called for a jump ball; the possession arrow pointed to UST. Eric Salamat was forced to foul June Cortez, who converted his first and missed his second, which led to the Ateneo rebound with 3.6 ticks left. Jai Reyes heaved a desperation three-pointer that missed the ring completely, causing jubilation to the golden half of the Coliseum. An estimated 20,000 packed the Araneta Coliseum including United States Ambassador to the Philippines Kristie Kenney and Senator Richard Gordon .\nJojo Duncil was named Finals MVP award. Jarencio won his first UAAP title for UST."
