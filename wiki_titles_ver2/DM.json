The game was played in the afternoon on Wednesday, July 23, at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., and resulted in a 9–3 victory for the National League. Steve Carlton was the winning pitcher while Mel Stottlemyre was the losing pitcher.\nThe game was originally scheduled for the evening of Tuesday, July 22, but heavy rains forced its postponement to the following afternoon. The 1969 contest remains the last All-Star Game to date to be played earlier than prime time in the Eastern United States.\nPresident Richard Nixon originally planned to attend the Tuesday night game and throw out the first ball, and then depart for the splashdown of Apollo 11 in the Pacific Ocean. But with the game's postponement until Wednesday afternoon, Nixon missed the game altogether and Vice President Spiro Agnew attended instead.\nGame summary.\nAfter scoring in the first inning on an error, the National League made it 3–0 in the second inning against AL starter Mel Stottlemyre on a two-run homer by Reds' catcher Johnny Bench. Denny McLain was scheduled as the American League starter, but was late arriving to the stadium (via his own airplane) and pitched later in the game.\nFive more runs came across for the NL in the third inning, Blue Moon Odom of Oakland surrendering all. Willie McCovey's two-run homer and back-to-back doubles by Félix Millán and pitcher Steve Carlton were the key blows.\nMcCovey added another home run in the fourth, and was voted the game's most valuable player."

        "title": "Lofting (bowling)",
        "text": "Lofting (by a bowler) in bowling is throwing a bowling ball a short or long distance down the lane. This is usually done with the bounce-pass technique, but can also be done with a straight ball. Lofting is sometimes discouraged by the bowling community and bowling alley employees, because it can sometimes cause damage to the ball and lanes. However, this is somewhat untrue. Loft will almost never cause major damage to a ball, nor will lofting cause damage to (synthetic) lanes. Many bowling alleys that use wooden lanes will either have signs that tell the bowlers not to loft, or an employee will inform the bowlers not to do so, because wooden lanes can be dented by a lofted ball. Lofting the ball before the arrows in some bowling alleys is not against the rules. Some professional bowlers do loft a considerable amount under certain lane conditions. Crankers and other high-rev players may be forced to loft under dry conditions in order to delay the ball's reaction and prevent it from over-hooking. Lofting over the gutter is known as \"lofting the gutter cap,\" and is sometimes done when a bowler has to hook the whole lane on a very broken-down oil pattern. It's common for this to happen at qualifying rounds for the US Open.\nIn the sport of candlepin bowling, \"lofting\" a ball beyond a \"lob line\" situated ten feet (3.05 m) down the lane from the main foul line, without it touching the lane anywhere on the bowler's side of it, is called a lob, and is considered a ball foul, resulting in no counted pinfall from a ball delivered in such a manner, as the ball must first touch the lanebed anywhere on the bowler's side of the lob line to be considered a legal delivery."

        "title": "Hook (bowling)",
        "text": "A hook in ten-pin bowling is a ball that rolls in a curving pattern (as opposed to straight). The purpose of the hook is to give the ball a better angle at the 1-3 pocket (right-handers) or 1-2 pocket (left-handers.) to achieve a strike. When a ball is rolled straight, hitting the pocket must be precise. By hooking the ball, the ball will hit the pins with more force, producing better carry - especially on the 5-pin during a strike ball. Straight roll - even when it hits the pocket, will tend to leave a tap such as the 5-pin on a light hit, or the 10-pin if the ball was just slightly right of center pocket or with inadequate entry angle. A hook ball can achieve strikes with less precise hits.\nA hook ball can also help the bowler shape the shot on challenging oil patterns.\nIn duckpin bowling, candlepin bowling, and nine-pin bowling, hook potential is greatly reduced since the balls are generally rolled much faster and thus have less time for a hook to develop.\nTechniques.\nThere are two ways to produce a hook. The first method involves bowling technique. At the moment of throwing the bowling ball, the hand should be behind the ball and where the thumb (for a right-hander) is anywhere between 10-o'clock and 12-o'clock, and the two fingers are between 4-o'clock and 6-o'clock. Just before releasing the ball, the entire hand starts rotating in a counter-clockwise motion. The thumb must fall out of the ball first, then the middle and ring finger release almost simultaneously, again in a counter-clockwise direction (called \"lift\"). A lift release gives the roll more torque (and therefore more power), along with the spin needed for the hook. When the two fingers lift the ball correctly, it will cause the thumb to naturally fall out of the ball first, so one does not have to make a conscious effort to remove the thumb before the fingers.\nThere are innumerable variations in style and technique and the position of the thumb can vary from person to person. Some bowlers, including professionals, will actually roll the bowling ball with just the two fingers, allowing the hand to give the ball even more torque without having to worry about the thumb restricting the spin.\nThe second way to produce a hook is by modifying the bowling ball. Illegally, one can play with the \"weighting\" of the bowling ball, such as drilling the ball so that there is more side weight on the right side of the ball (for a right-hander,) which would cause the ball to pull from right to left, causing a hook. Bowling balls ship with the weighting specifications on the container. A bowling shop professional can drill a bowling ball by first knowing the type of roll the bowler wants, and then can pick out the bowling ball with the weighting specifications in mind that match the bowler's needs. For a beginning bowler, the professional will usually drill the ball with the label directly in the middle, and between the fingers and thumb holes, causing the weighting to be balanced on both sides, causing the ball to roll straight.\nUnder USBC regulations, one can drill up to five holes on the bowling ball. Most bowlers use three holes (thumb and two fingers,). On past, one could drill additional holes on other parts of the bowling ball, to take additional weight off of a portion of the bowling ball, such as an \"axis hole\" that allows the bowling ball's hook to stabilize during its roll to the pins. Doctoring the bowling ball by adding additional holes was recommended for experienced bowlers enough to know where to place these holes, such as studying the track area of the ball and knowing where to place the axis hole. Starting August 1, 2020, there is elimination of balance holes. With the elimination of balance holes, bowlers may have up to five holes for gripping purposes and all gripping holes must be used on every delivery.\nBackup ball.\nA \"backup ball\" or \"back-up ball\" produces the opposite result of a hook. When a ball is rolled by a right-hander, the ball will hook from left to right. The bowling ball can be drilled for a left-handed bowler. The exact same principles of hooking a ball are applied on a backup ball, except the hand rotates clockwise for a right-handed bowler and counterclockwise for a left-handed bowler.\nBackup balls are rarely thrown intentionally by serious bowlers, as the hand motion is much more difficult to accomplish than a standard hook. However, certain spares, such as the 2-8-10 for a right-hander, are easier to accomplish with one (as the rules of bowling prevent a bowler from switching hands). Bowlers may also use a backup ball due to lane conditions and a very small number of bowlers throw a backup ball regularly. "

The VCA Stadium is the home ground for the Vidarbha and Central Zone cricket teams for the domestic Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy tournaments respectively. As of January 2020 it has hosted more T20I matches (12) than any other stadium in India. As of 10 November 2019 it has hosted 6 Tests, 9 ODIs and 12 T20Is.\nOverview.\nSachin Tendulkar said \"the facilities exceeded all expectations\" and Ricky Ponting commented on the comfort in the changing rooms.\nRajasthan Royals skipper Shane Warne was extremely pleased with the \"largeness of the ground\" after his team's two-run win over Deccan Chargers. \"Michael Lumb's slog to deep mid-wicket found a fielder. Now, if this was M. A. Chidambaram Stadium or M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, then that ball would have landed in a taxi going to the team hotel. We need big grounds like these,\" Warne said. It has 80-yard straight boundaries and 85-yard square boundaries, which makes it one of the largest grounds (in terms of playing area) in the world.\nLalit Modi said the VCA was \"by far the best stadium in India\". The stadium has been praised not only by the players but also by commentators and journalists because of the facilities. Alan Wilkins said, \"It is a fabulous stadium, a Colosseum here in Nagpur. It has the most impressive Press box for the travelling media. It really is a wonderful venue.\"\nThe first international match at this venue was the Fourth Test between India and Australia in November 2008, which India won by 172 runs. The Australian spinner Jason Krejza finished with 12 wickets, while Harbhajan Singh claimed seven for India.\nFour matches were played at the stadium during the 2011 Cricket World Cup. The highest Test scores are by India: 566/8, 558/6 and 441. The leading run scorers in Tests are Virendar Sehwag (357), Virat Kohli (354) and MS Dhoni (339). The leading wicket takers in a Test are R Ashwin (23 wickets), Ishant Sharma (19) and Harbhajan Singh (13 wickets).

        "title": "Cycling in New Zealand",
        "text": "Cycling in New Zealand is the 5th most popular form of active recreation (9% cycled in the last week), but a very marginal commuting mode, with the share hovering around 1–3% in most major cities. This is due to a number of factors, principally safety fears.\nHistory.\nThe bicycle reached New Zealand in the 1860s in the form of the velocipede, also known as the 'boneshaker'. As bicycle design improved, and production became mass-market, cycling became a popular mode of transport in many parts of New Zealand for half a century.\nCycling was a popular form of transportation in New Zealand by the 20th century. Christchurch claimed its title as the cycling capital of New Zealand in the early 20th century, with its flat physical geography the bicycle was a form of everyday transport earning it the name of \"Cyclopolis\". In 1924, it was estimated that 40,000 of Christchurch's approximately 80,000 people were cycling and by the late 1930s it was estimated that Christchurch was home to 20% of New Zealand's 250,000 bicycles.\nIn the 1950s and 60s, government transport funding and policies favouring motor vehicles as the transport of the future, along with the increasing affordability of automobiles, spurred a rise in motor vehicles. New Zealand soon had, and still has, one of the highest rates of car dependence in the world.\nAs well as abandoning bicycles (and public transport) in favour of cars, the remaining cyclists were increasingly forced off the streets by the rising danger of motor traffic, relegating bicycles to recreational and sports use. The oil shocks of the 1970s triggered the first of several bicycle resurgences, and new sports bicycles became popular: first, road racing bikes, then BMXs and eventually mountain bikes. By 1990, a survey showed cycling to be the second most popular participation sport in New Zealand. Since then, cycle sales have remained high, averaging over 150,000 per annum. However, their everyday uses, such as for commuting or shopping, is still rare.\nIn 1994, New Zealand introduced mandatory bicycle helmet wearing, a change which some parts of academia and cycling advocacy credit with further reducing the incidence and attractiveness of cycling.\nSafety.\nIn the mid 2000s, Auckland Regional Transport Authority reported that “over half of Aucklanders believe it is usually unsafe, or always unsafe, to cycle”. A 2019 study found that only 28% of beginner cyclists are willing to ride on roads with no cycle provision. This high perceived risk to bicycle users in New Zealand's largest city is due to a number of factors. Motorists tend to exhibit hostile attitudes towards bicycle riders. Bicycles are classed as 'vehicles', a transport class legally obliged to use the road, forcing bicycle users to mingle with heavy and fast-moving motor vehicles; only postal workers are legally permitted to ride on footpaths. Bicycle infrastructure and the standards underpinning bicycle infrastructure planning are poor and bicycles receive relatively very low levels of funding by both central and local government.\nCycling and national and local government.\nSince the 1990s, many local Councils have developed cycling (or walking &amp; cycling) strategies to plan for the provision of cycle-friendly environments and the promotion of cycling for transport and recreation. The Government, in its 2002 NZ Transport Strategy (and 2008 revision), officially acknowledged the role that cycling can play in helping to achieve a number of strategic transport outcomes, and in 2005 the first national Walking and Cycling Strategy \"Getting There: On Foot, By Cycle\" was released. However, from 2008 the new National-led Government set aside this strategy and restricted funding for cycling facilities, citing the need for motorway investment instead. The one significant investment from 2010 was the \"Model Walking and Cycling Communities\" programme, which saw $7 million invested over 2 years in the two chosen communities, Hastings and New Plymouth, as demonstration projects of what could be achieved with concentrated focus – a further $15 million was then earmarked to these towns for 2012–15.\nFollowing a spate of cycle crashes in late 2010, a national coronial inquiry considered the issue of cycle safety. After hearing submissions from a wide range of parties, Coroner Matenga recommended in 2013 that an expert panel, led by the NZ Transport Agency, be put together to recommend to central and local government how to prevent further cycling deaths and improve safety. A Cycle Safety Panel of ten specialists was convened in 2014 and spent the year gathering evidence and then making a wide-ranging series of recommendations. A key recommendation was that a significant injection in cycleway infrastructure funding was required by Government. As a result, a $100 million Urban Cycleways Fund was announced by the Government and, in conjunction with existing local and national transport funding, this led to a record $330 million cycleways programme over 2015–18.\nCycling is increasingly becoming a touristic and (at least local) economic factor in the 2010s. In addition to successful cycle touring schemes (like those gathered under the New Zealand Cycle Trail umbrella) credited with revitalising local back country areas, are experiences like those reported from Rotorua, where the mountain biking business within the Whakarewarewa timber plantation forest is several times that earned annually from the timber plantation itself.\nAs a mode of transportation, cycling has fallen from its historic peaks. The modal share of cycling for transportation has stayed similar since the 70s. In 1976 the figure stood at 3%. In 1986 this had increased to 5%, in Christchurch, Hastings and Whanganui 10% of people biked to work while due to its difficult geography in Wellington this figure was only 1.4%. Between 2003 and 2014, cycling made up between 2–3% of all nationwide journeys. Different metropolitan regions had different shares. Cycling in Auckland only made up 1% of journeys between 2003–2014. In Hamilton this varied from 2–5%. In Tauranga this varied from 0–2%. In Wellington (including Kapiti) this varied from 1–3%, in Tauranga this varied from 1–4%. Christchurch had the highest share with cycling making up between 5–9% of journeys between 2003–2014.\nThe New Zealand Transport Strategy 2008 set a target to increase walking, cycling and other active modes to 30% of trips in urban areas by 2040. However, a decade later there were still only 2% of travel to work trips cycled and 5.2% made on foot.\nTactical urbanism.\nWaka Kotahi ran an Innovating Streets for People scheme between 2019 and 2021 to improve safety, using an adaptable approach, known as tactical urbanism. 32 councils had 78 projects for walking, cycling and reducing vehicle speeds and traffic. Take up of the scheme was variable. Research found some councils were hesitant about Innovating Streets projects because of risk avoidance, business and resident opposition, regulatory requirements, reluctance to take on new schemes, lack of capacity and cost. For example, Wellington approved a network of cycleways for $226 m, Auckland a $3 m Regional Streets for People programme and Waipā, a biking and micro mobility plan, but Tauranga's Innovating Streets Project did not proceed.\nWellington has seen the greatest application of tactical urbanism. Its expensive and over-engineered Island Bay cycleway had ended at the edge of the suburb and been delayed by controversy and court cases. It was being built as part of a 2015 cycling master plan. Councillor Tamatha Paul won an amendment to Wellington's 2021 long term plan to complete the master plan network for $226m. In 2021 Wellington had of cycleways, mostly along coastlines. Tactical urbanism was used to reduce build time from 3 to 10 years, to an average of 18 months per cycleway, using teams to do design and public engagement at the same time. Problematic areas used cheap, adaptable solutions and elsewhere more permanent concrete dividers and tree planters were put in. For example, speed bumps made it easier for fire trucks to pull out of a fire station, a loading zone provided for a car dealer and protective barriers outside a bus depot were removed to ease turning for buses. Cycleways serving Newtown, the Botanical Gardens, Aro Valley and Ngaio were built in 2023. Another 6, at various stages, will bring will bring the cycle network to , with a plan for by 2030. The first two bike lanes cost $750,000 a kilometre, well below the $1.6m national average. They were also completed in less than half the typical time. However, there are still problems. Foodstuffs threatened legal action to stop a cycleway going past their Thorndon store. Routes for Kilbirnie, Thorndon, Berhampore, Karori, Wadestown and Brooklyn were planned, but the 10-year cycle budget was cut in 2023 from $191m to $110m.\nFunding has been a wider problem. For example, in 2021 Waikato Regional Council explained the small spend on walking/cycling (3%) in its region, saying that, although Government, \"elevated climate change as a national strategic priority, the Government has not provided the funding to achieve the transformational change necessary to meet its climate change targets and expectations. . . Waka Kotahi stating that 90% of anticipated revenue is committed to a significant programme of work already underway . . . There is therefore, extremely limited funding for new projects . . . to support mode shift and climate change transport activities, like cycling, walking and public transport initiatives.\"\nInfrastructure.\nIn recent decades a number of cycleways have been established through New Zealand, most of them rail trails.\nNew Zealand Cycle Trail.\nIn early 2009, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, proposed a 'New Zealand Cycleway' and in mid 2009, $50 million for the first three years was set aside for construction of a network of 'Great Rides' (Nga Haerenga), most of which opened between 2011 and 2013.\nIn 2020, there were 1,985,600 trips on the New Zealand Cycle Trail Great Rides (compared with 1,300,000 estimated trips in 2015). 1,025,000 of these trips were by pedestrians. 960,200 of these trips were by cyclists. At 1,822 cycle trips for the year, the St James Cycle Trail was the least popular of the Great Rides (unchanged since 2015). At 188,000 cycle trips and 220,000 pedestrian trips for the year, the Hawke’s Bay Cycle Trail was the most popular. Otago Central Rail Trail recorded 68,000 trips, with 13,000 of these being people riding the full trail (similar to 2015).\nEvents and races.\nA number of cycling events are held around the country as fun rides, fundraisers or competitive cycling events:\nOrganisations and institutions.\nCycling Action Network (CAN) is a national cycling advocacy group founded in November 1996. It aims to achieve a better cycling environment for cycling as transport and tourism. Major initiatives are the annual Cycle Friendly Awards and support for a biennial Cycling Conference (now held as a joint walking &amp; cycling conference).\nCAN is the parent organisation for some 20 local cycling advocacy groups around the country, including Bike Auckland, Cycle Aware Wellington and Spokes Canterbury.\nBikeNZ was created in July 2003 to act as an umbrella body embracing all national bike and cycling organisations including, BMX NZ, CAN, Cycling NZ, Mountain Bike NZ and NZ Schools Cycling Association. It is the national governing body of cycle racing and has a strong focus on sports cycling; in 2014 BikeNZ rebranded as Cycling NZ. CAN was a member of BikeNZ and provided one board member from BikeNZ's inception in July 2003. CAN resigned from BikeNZ in October 2007, but continues to work with BikeNZ on advocacy issues.\nVorb is an online forum set up by Tama Easton as a place for stories and photos from mountain bike trips of a group of friends. In early 2001 it became public, got mentioned in the media and quickly grew into one of the most used sports and outdoors websites in New Zealand, long extending beyond just mountain biking or even cycling. The Vorb community has grown into tens of thousands of cyclists, trampers, climbers, paddlers and others. Vorb has won \"Best Sports and Recreation Site\" at the People's Choice Netguide Web Awards for 2007, 2008 and 2009 in the 'Best Sports and Recreation Site' category.\nHelmets.\nSince 1994 it has been mandatory by law to wear a bicycle helmet while riding a bicycle in New Zealand. The law was enacted after intense lobbying by Rebecca Oaten after her son was injured in a cycle accident.\nA study on bicycle helmets using cost-benefit analysis found that the law was only cost-effective for the 5- to 12-year-old age group. A Massey University study in 2006 found that compulsory bicycle helmet laws led to a lower uptake of cycling, especially among women.\nAdvocacy groups like Cycle Action Auckland have argued that helmets are useful safety devices, but noted out that some cyclists consider them a symbol portraying cycling as dangerous, especially when most severe cycling crashes had been shown to be caused by inattentive motorists."

He won a major event, the 2010 Players Championship Finals, where he defeated Mervyn King in the final. He was also the runner-up to Phil Taylor in the 2011 Championship League Darts, and part of the Australia team which lost a sudden death shoot-out to England in the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts final.\nNicholson also acts as a sports commentator and TV and radio pundit. He was nicknamed \"The Asset\", and was known for coming on to the stage with sunglasses, and was also known for his professional wrestling-style walk ons, using the song \"Club Foot\" as his walk on music for most of his career. Nicholson had a feud with Phil Taylor during the 2011 UK Open, in which he supposedly \"waved goodbye\" to Taylor after beating him in a sudden death leg to reach the quarter-finals.\nCareer.\n2008/2009.\nBefore joining the PDC Pro Tour, Nicholson was one of the top players in the Australian Grand Prix circuit, winning 15 titles in 2008. His performances led him to the top of the DPA rankings and earned him a spot in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. He was drawn in Group H with Kevin Painter, Darryl Fitton and WDF number one Gary Anderson. Nicholson caused a surprise, as he beat Anderson 5–4 in his opening group game. This was despite constant booing from the crowd, who began chanting \"Who Are You?\" during his walk-on and after his first three darts which was a maximum 180, he put his finger to his mouth at the crowd which caused the crowd to boo him almost every time he threw his darts. Despite beating Anderson, losses to Fitton and Painter eliminated him at the group stage.\nNicholson earned qualification for the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship through the DPA rankings. He defeated Adrian Gray in the first round, winning all nine legs for a three sets to nil victory. He then beat world number 6 Adrian Lewis in the second round 4–3 and then came from two sets down to beat world number 11 Dennis Priestley 4–2 to advance to the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals, he lost to world number 3 at the time, James Wade but his tournament performance lifted him into the top 50 on the PDC Order of Merit.\nAfter his performance in the World Championship, Nicholson decided to leave the DPA and play in the PDC Pro Tour in an attempt to qualify for the UK Open. His last 16 place in the Southern Regional finals ensured his qualification for the tournament. He beat Gary Anderson 6 legs to 4 in the second round, before losing 9–7 to pub qualifier Ken Mather, whereafter his relationship with the crowd soured further, claiming Mather's crowd had repeatedly shouted out while he was throwing. After the match as the crowd chanted \"who are you\" directed at Nicholson, he responded using profanity towards the crowd which he was later fined for by the DRA.\nNicholson reached the semi-final of the PDPA Players Championship Barnsley 2, defeating Gary Mawson, Mark Dudbridge, John MaGowan, Justin Pipe and Denis Ovens before losing out to Colin Osborne, the eventual winner. Nicholson did not enter the qualifiers for the Las Vegas Desert Classic and failed to qualify for the World Matchplay.\n2010.\nIn 2010, Nicholson claimed his first PDC title, The Totesport Player's Championship. He had to play the quarter-final, the semi-final and the final in the same day. In the quarter-final he defeated Adrian Lewis 9–7. He then overcame reigning champion Phil Taylor 10–9 in the semi-finals, and followed this up with a 13–11 victory over Mervyn King in the final. During the latter stages of the tournament, the crowd started to support Nicholson due to his efforts against higher ranked and more experienced opponents (in particular Taylor), and as a result he relaxed his behaviour leading many pundits such as Alan Warriner-Little to suggest that he might give up the 'bad boy' image and just be himself. In March 2010, he moved into the top 16 of the PDC Order of merit for the first time. In the UK Open 2010, he beat Kirk Shepherd 9–6 in the third round, and 7–9 to Gary Anderson in the fourth round. On his World Matchplay debut, he lost 3–10 to Steve Beaton in the first round.\n2011.\nIn the 2011 World Championship, Nicholson continued reached the second round. He won his first title since January 2010 by winning the Crawley Players Championship (1) by defeating Adrian Lewis 6–4. He also came through a semi final clash with Gary Anderson defeating him 6–5.\nAt the 2011 UK Open, Nicholson won final-leg deciders against Gary Anderson in round four, and Phil Taylor in round five, to reach the quarter-finals. He lost 7–10 to eventual champion James Wade.\nAt the 2011 World Matchplay, Nicholson defeated Colin Osborne in the first round to secure a second-round match with Raymond van Barneveld.\nAt the 2011 Championship League Darts, Nicholson lost 6–1 to Phil Taylor in the final.\n2012.\nNicholson made it to the last 16 of the 2012 World Championship by recording 3–1 and 4–0 victories over Mensur Suljović and Alan Tabern respectively. He next played Belgian Kim Huybrechts and won the first set, before losing 12 of the next 14 legs to exit the tournament 1–4. He hit 21% of his doubles in the match.\nAfter losing in the final of the Spanish Players Championship, Nicholson partnered Simon Whitlock again for the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts. Together they had victories over Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands to reach their first World Cup final, where they played the English pair of Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis. Australia found themselves 0–3 down in the final, meaning that Nicholson had to beat Lewis in the last singles match and then win the doubles to force the tie to a sudden-death leg for the World Cup crown. Australia won both of the matches 7–4 and in the sudden-death leg Whitlock and Nicholson both missed two darts each to secure the title, with Lewis hitting the winning double for England. After the match Nicholson vowed that Australia would win the title in the future.\nIn June, Nicholson missed ten darts to reach the quarter-finals of the UK Open as he lost 8–9 to Denis Ovens in the last 16. In the World Matchplay he was beaten 6–10 by Andy Smith. \nAfter his 0–6 first round defeat to Andy Hamilton in the European Championship he did some commentating for ESPN who were broadcasting the tournament in the UK. At the World Grand Prix he beat Michael Mansell and Colin Osborne to reach his first quarter-final in the event. He faced Wes Newton and led 2–0 in sets, but was unable to take out 106 for a straight sets win and instead went on to lose 2–3. In October, he reached his first final since the World Cup in February at the fifth European Tour Event of the year, the Dutch Darts Masters. His run included a win over Michael van Gerwen, who had won four tournaments in the previous two months and a semi-final victory over Wayne Jones who beat Phil Taylor in the previous round. He faced compatriot Whitlock in a first all Australian final on the PDC ProTour and lost 1–6, admitting afterwards that he had run out of steam by the conclusion of the tournament. At the Grand Slam of Darts, Nicholson lost two out of his three Group F games to finish third in the table and fail to qualify for the last 16. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Nicholson was 18th on the Order of Merit, inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He missed one dart in the deciding leg against Ronnie Baxter in the first round, losing 5–6.\n2013.\nNicholson lost in the second round of the 2013 World Championship to Robert Thornton. He survived a total of five match darts from Thornton to take the match into a sudden death leg, which he lost. Nicholson never had a dart to win himself but did throw for the match during the final set. In his third World Cup of Darts with Simon Whitlock the pair were beaten in the last 16 when the Belgian brothers of Ronny and Kim Huybrechts defeated them 1–5.\nOn 16 &amp; 17 March 2013, Nicholson had wins over Dave Chisnall, Ross Smith, Darren Whittingham, Louis Blundell, Kim Huybrechts, Brendan Dolan, Co Stompé, Richie Burnett and Ronnie Baxter to secure back-to-back quarter final spots in the Speedy Services UK Open Qualifier 3 &amp; Qualifier 4 events in Wigan. He was then whitewashed by Michael van Gerwen 6–0 in the quarter-final of Qualifier 3 and lost to 6–5 Gary Anderson the following day in the quarter-final of Qualifier 4.\nNicholson competed a few weeks later at the European Darts Trophy in Sindelfingen, Germany. He saw off Ronny Huybrechts 6–5 in the first round before coming back from 5–1 down to defeat Colin Lloyd in the last 32. He then claimed wins over Dean Winstanley and Mark Webster to secure a semi-final clash with world number three Michael van Gerwen. He saw off van Gerwen 6–2 to face Wes Newton in the final. Nicholson missed nine darts to lead 5–3 and in the deciding leg had three darts to win the tournament on 24, but hit a single 12 with his first and burst his score by hitting a single 13 with his second and lost the match 5–6. He reached another final in May at the third Players Championship but was defeated 4–6 by Jamie Caven.\nNicholson lost 9–5 to John Bowles in the third round of the UK Open. In the opening round of the World Matchplay he saw 4–1 and 8–7 leads over Dave Chisnall turn into a 10–8 defeat and was in tears on the stage during the final leg. Nicholson said later that the feeling of not having enough during the match was too much to handle, but hoped the experience would be a starting point for a new phase in his career.\nHe reached the last 16 of the Grand Slam of Darts losing heavily to James Wade 10–1.\n2014.\nNicholson beat Stuart Kellett 3–0 in the opening round of the 2014 World Championship, but Kevin Painter beat Nicholson 4–0 in the subsequent round. He co-commentated on the final, for BBC Radio 5 Live. Nicholson lost 9–5 to Terry Jenkins in the UK Open fourth round. Nicholson and Whitlock won through to the semi-finals of the World Cup of Darts where they faced England's Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis in a repeat of 2012's final. Whitlock was beaten 4–1 by Taylor, before Nicholson overcame Lewis 4–2 to mean a doubles match was required to settle the tie which Australia lost 4–0. Nicholson overcame Robert Thornton 10–8 in the first round of the World Matchplay, explaining later that his form had suffered over the previous months due to pains in his neck and shoulders which he has worked with an acupuncturist to help relieve. In the second round, Wes Newton fought back from 5–0 and 8–3 deficits and went on to survive five match darts from Nicholson to knock him out 15–13. This was the last major Nicholson played in during the year as he failed to qualify for the World Grand Prix, European Championship, Grand Slam and Players Championship Finals.\n2015.\nNicholson walked onto the stage without sunglasses for the first time in his career at the 2015 World Championship in a further attempt to move away from his bad boy of darts image. His first round match against Benito van de Pas went to a deciding set in which Nicholson lost all three legs to exit the tournament. He left his darts on the stage afterwards and said that he was unsure what he would do in the future. He returned to play the full schedule of events and qualified for the third round of the 2015 UK Open in which he drew Michael van Gerwen and lost 9–3. In the quarter-finals of the World Cup Nicholson knew a win over Belgium's Kim Huybrechts would see Australia reach the semis. He was 3–0 up but then missed a total of six match darts which led to him losing 4–3. Australia then lost the deciding doubles match 4–2. Nicholson failed to qualify for another PDC major event and could not get past the last 16 of any Pro Tour tournament. He fell outside the top 32 on the Order of Merit during the year and after losing in the first round of the qualifier it meant that missed out on playing in the World Championship for the first time since the 2008 event.\n2016.\nNicholson failed to qualify for the 2016 UK Open for the first time since the 2008 event. He reached the last 16 of one event all year, the 13th Players Championship, by beating Nathan Aspinall, Kyle Anderson (the player who has replaced him in Australia's World Cup team) and Simon Whitlock, but he then lost 6–1 to Benito van de Pas. He began commentating for the PDC during European Tour events and also for the BBC in the inaugural Champions League of Darts.\n2017.\nNicholson was a studio analyst and commentator on Channel 4's coverage of the 2017 BDO World Darts Championship. He was ranked 84th after the 2017 PDC World Championship and played in Q School to try and win his place on the tour back. He lost in the final round of the third day to Richie Burnett, before going all the way on the last day to earn a two-year Tour Card.\nThe rest of Nicholson's year was good enough to give him enough ranking money to qualify for the 2017 Players Championship Finals, although being the 59th seed meant he had to play Michael van Gerwen and lost 6–3.\n2018.\nNicholson, needing a good year to hold on to his tour card, made a good start by qualifying for the UK Open, where he eventually lost to Paul Hogan 10–6 in the third round.\nHe continued his form by winning through to a European tour semi-final, where he was beaten by Adrian Lewis; this run effectively sealed his spot in the European Championships, as the 32nd seed, and the World Championships, due to there being more spots open to Pro Tour qualifiers this year.\nNicholson made his return to the European Championship, where he was up against the top seed Michael van Gerwen. He made a good account of himself by opening with back-to-back twelve-darters with a 127 checkout on the bullseye, but failed to hit darts to go 3–2 up, and failed to win another leg; he lost 6–2.\n2019.\nHe announced on 11 January that he will not attend the 2019 PDC Q School in an attempt to renew his tour card. He insisted he needed to work on his darts, game and head in order to get himself ready for 2020.\n2020.\nAhead of Q-School, Nicholson announced that he will no longer be representing Australia in an interview with the BDO \nFeud with Phil Taylor.\nIn the 2011 UK Open, Nicholson defeated Phil Taylor in the last 16 by 9 legs to 8 and supposedly waved goodbye to him. While being interviewed at that year's World Matchplay, Nicholson spoke of Taylor's reaction and stated that when they met again, if Taylor did not bring his 'A' game he would \"put him to bed\". Nicholson defended the gesture saying: 'I was waving bye-bye to the demons which had dogged me in too many televised tournaments'. The comments garnered much media attention.\nTaylor reacted angrily to Nicholson's comments, telling BBC Radio Stoke, \"I think he's very, very silly.\" Taylor added that Nicholson \"has a big mouth and won't keep it shut\". He played Taylor in an eagerly anticipated match at the 2011 European Darts Championships and was beaten 10–7, despite being 7–6 ahead. He was then defeated at the 2011 World Grand Prix by Taylor 3–0.\nCM Punk Association.\nDuring his walk-on in his second-round match against Raymond van Barneveld in the 2011 World Matchplay, Nicholson mimicked former WWE wrestler CM Punk by having X's marked on his hands, and also lifted up a Nexus scarf. However, he lost the match, 13–9. Then, when he met Phil Taylor, he once again mimicked CM Punk during his walk-on, using his signature pose on one knee, shouting \"It's clobberin' time\" and punching the air. During Taylor's walk-on, Nicholson sat Indian-style on the stage, another trait of CM Punk, in an attempt to anger Taylor."

        "text": "Richard William Bass (July 7, 1906 – February 3, 1989) was a Major League Baseball pitcher.\nBass grew up in rural Tennessee, in the small town of Rogersville. A tall, right-handed pitcher, Bass attended Miami University in Ohio, where he was named to the All-Buckeye baseball teams during his junior and senior years. He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals organization, and made his pro debut with Shawnee, Oklahoma in 1930; he wound up in Louisville by 1932 and pitched parts of six seasons with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association, winning 17 games in 1934. After winning 19 games with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association in 1939, Bass got the call to the majors, starting for the Washington Senators on September 21, 1939.\nBass and the Cleveland Indians' Al Milnar battled through six scoreless innings, before Washington's Charlie Gelbert hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the seventh, giving the Nats a 2–0 lead. But Bass fell apart in the eighth, giving up singles to Roy Weatherly, Ben Chapman and Odell Hall. After hitting Bruce Campbell with a pitch to load the bases, Ken Keltner doubled to give Cleveland a lead they would never relinquish; Cleveland would win, 6–3, ruining Bass' major league debut. Most of Bass' start (from the fourth inning onwards) can still be heard today, as part of the WJSV broadcast day tapes, making it one of the oldest baseball play-by-play broadcasts still extant.\nIt would be Bass' only game in the majors. Already 33 years old, he would return to Chattanooga, then enlist in World War II. (Instead of heading overseas, however, Bass remained in Ohio, employed as a purchasing agent by an aluminum company in Dayton. He also managed the local amateur baseball team to four city championships and the World's Amateur Championship at Youngstown, Ohio in 1944.) After the war, he pitched for and managed Class D clubs in Gainesville, Florida and Kingsport, Tennessee, not far from his old hometown. In 1948, when Bass was fired by Kingsport, he took another managerial job, coaching not men but women: the Fort Wayne Daisies of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\nBass died in 1989, in Graceville, Florida."

All his other appearances saw him beaten in the first round where he lost to the likes of Eric Bristow (1987), Cliff Lazarenko (1988) and Bob Taylor (1994). Payne is, along with Davy Richardson and Steve West, one of three players to have lost their first five matches at the World Championship.\nDespite his poor record at the world championship, Payne fared better in other BDO majors, reaching the final in the 1985 WDF World Cup Men's singles where he lost to Bristow and also reached the semi-finals of the 1985 Winmau World Masters where he lost to Northern Ireland's Ray Farrell. One of Payne's most notable career landmarks was his defeat of the former English player Steve Brown for the championship title of the 1990 Lucky Lights Challenge of Champions.\nIn July 1994, Payne crossed the darting divide where he was one of eleven Americans invited to play in the PDC World Matchplay. He lost in the first round to Singapore Paul Lim. After that, Payne retired from darts, preferring to spend more time with his family and newly acquired farm. However in 2003, Payne returned to the game and qualified for the Las Vegas Desert Classic, the first American darts player to qualify on live television, where he lost his opening group game to Steve Beaton but defeated Ronnie Baxter 8–1 which gave him a good chance of qualifying. However, Beaton went on to beat Baxter and win the group. Payne also played in the 2004 PDC World Darts Championship but lost in the first round to Steve Maish."

Brown lettered in 1930 and 1931, and started at quarterback in 1931. That season, he led the Cornhuskers to an 8-2 record, and an undefeated Big Six record and conference title. \nA native of Wisner, Nebraska, Brown wore jersey #17 throughout his Cornhusker career, and was the first of three Wisner High School graduates to star at Nebraska in the 1930s. His cousin, Jerry LaNoue, would follow Brown to Nebraska, where he would earn All Big Six honors at quarterback; in turn, it was LaNoue who encouraged fellow Wisner native Warren Alfson to become a Cornhusker football player. Alfson ultimately earned All-America recognition as a guard in 1940. \nLike Alfson and LaNoue, Brown worked for some time in order to save enough money to attend Nebraska. \nBrown had never played an organized game of football until joining the Cornhuskers, as Wisner High did not field a football team while he attended the school. Wisner briefly fielded a team following Brown's graduation, but they failed to achieve a winning season. Despite Brown's field success, Wisner High School soon dropped football again after his Cornhusker career was finished. However, Brown achieved significant success as a Wisner High basketball player--in fact, he was a starter on the Bulldogs' 1923 state champion team as an eighth grade student, despite not being old enough to legally play. So, he was the only Wisner student to letter five times in a varsity sport.\nAccording to Cornhusker records, Brown also lettered in baseball for Nebraska in 1930 and 1931. Soon after graduating from UNL, Brown relocated to California, and was still a resident there according to Wisner High alumni records in 1960."

        "text": "Steve West (born 5 June 1975) is an English darts player. He is the younger brother of 2003 World Master Tony West.\nBDO career.\nWest showed signs of a promising career quickly by reaching the final of the 2005 French Open, losing to local Dominique le Roy. He also reached the last 32 of the 2005 World Masters where he lost to Gary Anderson. In 2007, West reached another Open final in the 2007 Dutch Open, one of the BDO's biggest Open tournaments. Amongst his scalps were Dutchmen Co Stompé and Edwin Max before losing in the final to Scott Waites. Following this and three further quarter-finals, he qualified for the 2007 International Darts League, but was knocked out at the Preliminary Group Stage.\nWest then won his first Open title, winning the 2007 Denmark Open, beating the Netherlands' Niels de Ruiter in the semi-finals and then beat fellow Englishman James Wilson in the final. His performances earned him qualification for the 2008 BDO World Championship. He faced former World Champion Ted Hankey in the first round and lost 3–2 despite leading 2–1. West bounced back from his Lakeside defeat to win the 2008 German Gold Cup beating Andree Welge in the final. He then won the Finnish Open, beating local favourite and former Masters finalist Jarkko Komula in the semi-finals and then beat Norway's Robert Wagner in the final. He also made two semi-final showings in the Belgium Open and the French Open and reached the quarter-finals of the Northern Ireland Open. These performances helped West qualify automatically for the 2009 BDO World Championship at the Lakeside, where he was the number 13 seed. However, he was outclassed by Alan Norris 3–0 in the first round. West could not better this in 2010 either, as once again he relinquished a 2–1 lead this time to Irish débutante Martin McCloskey. In 2011, West once more lost in the first round to 2010 finalist Dave Chisnall after missing three darts at double top to win before Chisnall came back to force a tiebreak in the final set and eventually win. In 2012, West lost in the first round of the BDO World Championship for the fifth year in a row against former runner-up and world #1 Tony O'Shea. This levelled him with Davy Richardson and Tony Payne for the record of most first-round losses at the World Championship before finally winning.\nIt was announced at the end of the 2012 BDO World Championship that Steve would be one of many players to compete in the rival PDC's 'Q School' the following season, including his brother Tony.\nPDC career.\nStevie won a PDC tour card in the second day of 2012 qualifiers, defeating Gino Vos in the last round a day after Tony had earned his card. However, he did not play the full schedule of PDC ProTour events due to major hip surgery and could not advance beyond the last 64 in any of the ones he did play. He returned in 2013 to play in each of the eight UK Open Qualifiers where his best result came in event five, losing in the last 16 to Jelle Klaasen. West was placed 44th on the UK Open Order of Merit to enter the event in the second round, where he beat Jake Pennington 5–3. Further wins followed over Ian White and Richie Burnett to set up a fifth round meeting against Peter Wright, which he lost 9–4. The furthest he advanced during the rest of the season came in two Players Championships where he lost in the last 32 to Paul Nicholson and Wright both by 6–4 scorelines.\nWest's two-year PDC tour card expired after the 2014 World Championship and he finished outside the top 64 on the Order of Merit so therefore entered Q School in January 2014 to retain his place. He was successful on the final day by defeating Mareno Michels 5–3 in his last match, revealing afterwards that he has changed his throwing action due to a hip replacement and bone graft he received in late 2012. He qualified for the UK Open where he lost 5–4 against Tony Randall in the second round. West played in two European Tour events during the campaign, the German Darts Masters and European Darts Trophy, and was defeated by Dave Chisnall and Simon Whitlock both in the second round.\nWest began 2015 just outside the top 64 in the world rankings as he was number 66 and so once again entered Q School. On the third day he came through the event for the third time by beating Tim Martin 5–2 in the final round to earn a fresh two-year tour card. He was eliminated in the last 16 stage of four Players Championships during the year and lost 6–5 to Terry Jenkins in the second round of the European Darts Trophy after leading 4–1. West made his debut in the Grand Slam of Darts this year after overcoming Dean Winstanley, Wes Newton, Robert Owen and Eddie Dootson in the qualifying event. He finished third in his group after losing 5–2 and 5–3 to Kim Huybrechts and Michael van Gerwen and recording a 5–0 whitewash over Mark Oosterhuis.\nIn 2016 West's best results came in the second half of the year. Wins over Mike Zuydwijk, William O'Connor, Jeffrey de Zwaan, Simon Whitlock, Cristo Reyes and Ricky Evans at the 16th Players Championship event saw him play in his first PDC final. West was 4–2 down to Michael van Gerwen, but took out a 116 finish to lead 5–4. He threw for the title in a deciding leg and was unable to take out 110 as Van Gerwen won it 6–5. A semi-final followed in the 18th event after beating Adrian Lewis 6–3 and he lost 6–1 to Whitlock. The result qualified him for the World Grand Prix and he pulled off what he called the biggest moment of his darting life by knocking out 11-time winner of the event Phil Taylor 2–1. He lost 3–0 to Daryl Gurney in the second round with each set going to a deciding leg. He met his brother Tony in the first round of the German Darts Championship and averaged 109.98 in a 6–0 whitewash. West went on to see off Stephen Bunting 6–2 and Kim Huybrechts 6–5, before being defeated 6–2 by Alan Norris in the quarter-finals. He qualified for his first European Championship and lost the first five legs against Jelle Klaasen in the opening round and went on to be eliminated 6–3.\nOn his PDC World Championship debut, West won the opening two sets and was on 36 for the match in the third, when Mervyn King took out 136, went on to win the set and level at 2–2. In the decider, West missed two match darts and was knocked out 3–2.\nAfter a solid 2017 in which West reached a Pro Tour final (losing to Michael van Gerwen in a deciding leg) and won several matches in televised majors, West finally picked up his first ever victory at either version of the world championship at the seventh time of asking, by defeating Benito van de Pas 3-1 in the first round. He followed this with a win over another Dutchman, Jermaine Wattimena, 4-1 after surviving several darts to go 1-0 down. He was defeated by two-time champion Gary Anderson 4-2 in the last 16.\nWest lost his tour card following the 2023 World Championship."

On that occasion, New Zealand won 22–3.\nSince 1931, the overall winner of the annual test matches (between one and three games in any given year) between the All Blacks and the Wallabies takes possession of the Bledisloe Cup, named after Lord Bledisloe, who donated the trophy.\nCurrently the rivalry is one the most played of any two international rugby union teams, and having played against each other 177 times, the All Blacks lead the series 124 to 45 with 8 draws between them and includes a large number of fixtures recorded for New Zealand as \"XV\" results.\nSummary.\nThe summary below is for all matches where test caps were awarded by both national unions, which leaves out all 24 meetings from 1920 to 1928, in which the governing New Zealand Rugby Union fielded the second level New Zealand XV team rather than the highest All Blacks team. The Australian Rugby Union retroactively awarded test status caps to its own players for those matches.\nTri Nations and the professional era (1996–2011).\nThe professional era in rugby union began in 1995, marked by creation of the SANZAR group (a combination of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) which was formed with the purpose of selling TV rights for two new competitions, the domestic Super 12 competition and the Tri-Nations.\nThe first Tri-Nations was contested in 1996, with New Zealand winning all four of their Tests to take the trophy.\nIn 2000 in Sydney, a record crowd of 109,874 witnessed what some have called 'The Greatest Ever Rugby Match' when the All Blacks defeated The Wallabies 39–35. Twenty one days after their win in Sydney, the All Blacks lost to the Wallabies in front of a home crowd. This meant the Wallabies won The Bledisloe Cup for the third year in a row.\nAnother one of the most dramatic matches was played on 1 September 2001 at Stadium Australia, in what would be Wallaby great John Eales' last ever test. The Wallabies were hoping to send their skipper off in a grand style. A fairy tale ending was looking possible in the first half as the Wallabies took a 19–6 lead over the All Blacks. However, tries for Doug Howlett and Pita Alatini, along with Andrew Mehrtens kicking, saw the All Blacks back in front 26–22. Then, in the dying moments of the game No.8 Toutai Kefu scored the winning try for the Wallabies. Two years later in 2003 the Wallabies suffered one of their most humiliating losses, being defeated 21–50 by the All Blacks in Sydney.\nIn 2008, a Bledisloe Cup match was played in Hong Kong, which New Zealand won 19–14. It was rumoured that the United States and Japan would host future Bledisloe Cup matches, and these rumours proved true in the case of Japan, as Tokyo hosted a 2009 Bledisloe match.\nThe first two Tests of the 2010 series saw the All Blacks extend their winning streak over the Wallabies to 10 games. (Australia's last previous win came on 26 July 2008 at Sydney.) The third and fourth tests were extremely tight affairs, both being won by late tries. In the Sydney test on 11 September, converted tries by Richie McCaw and Kieran Read in the last 13 minutes allowed the All Blacks to overcome a 9–22 deficit. The win saw New Zealand complete a 100% record in the 2010 Tri-Nations. On 30 October 2010 the sides contested the now-customary fourth annual Bledisloe Cup test at a neutral venue. As in 2009, the match was played in Hong Kong, and as on 11 September the game was won with a dramatic late comeback. On this occasion the Wallabies, having led early in the match, found themselves 19–24 down as the hooter went, but with possession in the All Black 22. The Wallabies recycled through numerous phases of possession, until finally the ball was passed wide to James O'Connor, who beat the scrambling All Black defence to touch down and level the scores. The 20-year-old winger then kicked the resulting conversion to win the match for the Wallabies, ending New Zealand's recent domination of the fixture.\nSubsequently, (2011–2014) the All Blacks have won eight of the last eleven games played, with two drawn, continuing their domination. This included a crucial 20–6 victory over the Wallabies in the 2011 World Cup Semi-final to enable to All Blacks to progress to the final and subsequently win the World Cup.\nRugby Championship era (since 2012).\nStarting in 2012, the Tri Nations competition was renamed The Rugby Championship, and now includes Argentina.\nOn 17 August 2013 the All Blacks celebrated their 100th win over the Wallabies with a 47–29 victory in Sydney. After a shock 12–12 draw in Sydney in the first game of the 2014 series, which ended the All Blacks' attempt at the record of 18 straight wins for a major rugby nation, the All Blacks posted their highest ever score against Australia with a 51–20 victory at Eden Park on 23 August 2014.\nIn 2022, matches between Australia and New Zealand were reduced from a minimum of three per year, to two per year until 2025.\nResults.\nPre World War I (1903–1914).\nThe first Test between Australia and New Zealand was played on 15 August 1903 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Despite the Wallabies losing 22–3 this tour greatly increased the popularity of rugby and large crowds started attending grade matches in Sydney and Brisbane. New Zealand winger Billy Wallace scored thirteen of their twenty-two points.\nXV results (1920–1928).\nFrom 1920 to 1928, twenty-four matches took place for which Australia retrospectively awarded test caps and test match status. New Zealand did not award test caps. Out of these twenty-four matches, Australia won six, New Zealand eighteen.\nPre World War II (1929–1938).\nAustralia's last Test before World War I was against New Zealand in July 1914. The sports authorities in Australia decided it was unpatriotic to play rugby while thousands of young Australian men were being sent overseas to fight. This resulted in competitions all but closed down in New South Wales and Queensland. In Queensland, regular competitions did not commence again until 1928. As a result, players switched to rugby league in large numbers. Even though there was no Australia/New Zealand game after the war before 1929, twenty-four games were held between New South Wales and New Zealand XV from 1920 to 1928. The results were eighteen victories against six for the All Blacks with sixteen games taking place in Sydney, New South Wales (most of them at the Royal Agricultural Society Ground) and the rest in New Zealand. Those games are counted as Australia/New Zealand on the IRB website. Also 1931 saw the first game played competing for the Bledisloe Cup. However the \"official\" first Bledisloe Cup match wasn't played until 1932.\nPost War (1946–1974).\nThe first test following World War Two was played at Carisbrook, Dunedin between Australia and New Zealand in 1946, which New Zealand won 31–8. Australia did not win on the three-match tour; beaten 20–0 by New Zealand Māori, and then losing 14–10 to New Zealand the following week. The 1949 tour witnessed an infamous New Zealand record – the loss of two test matches on the same day. This was made possible because New Zealand's first team (and best thirty players) were touring South Africa at the same time. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand captained by J. B. Smith was beaten 11–6 by the Wallabies in Wellington. On 23 September New Zealand also lost their second Test, 16–9, which gave the Wallabies the Bledisloe Cup for the first time.\nFull amateur tours (1978–1995).\nThe period before the game finally turned professional was fairly brief and saw the final touring years between the two sides. It was also the period in which the first Rugby World Cup in 1987, co-hosted between Australia and New Zealand, was played. Between 1978 and 1995, Australia and New Zealand toured each other five and six times, respectively. The two teams played each other thirty-six times, New Zealand winning twenty-one of them, Australia fourteen.\nProfessional era (since 1995).\nSince the professional era, Australia and New Zealand have played each other consistently every year. Sometimes up to four times in a single year (2008, 2009, 2010, 2020), which is more times than any other two sides. Overall since the mid-1990s, the two teams have played each other over seventy times, including the 2003 Rugby World Cup Semi-final, the 2011 Rugby World Cup Semi-final and the 2015 Rugby World Cup final. Currently in the \"professional era\", New Zealand holds over fifty victories, with Australia holing eighteen."

        "text": "The 2009 Kansas State Wildcats baseball team represented Kansas State University in the NCAA Division I college baseball season of 2009. It was the 109th baseball season in school history.\nThe team's head coach was Brad Hill who was in his sixth season at Kansas State. He was previously the head coach at Central Missouri State before coming to Manhattan in 2004.\nKansas State made the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history. The team finished the season by setting the school's record for wins, eight more than the previous school record of 35 in 1976.\nPreseason.\nThe Wildcats, who recorded the most conference victories and its highest conference finish (tied for sixth) since 2002, return five pitchers who combined for 21 starts last season. The Wildcats will have junior A.J. Morris and seniors Lance Hoge and Todd Vogel, while sophomore Thomas Rooke, who tied for fifth in school history with 25 appearances out of the bullpen last year, could be called upon to start some games this year for the Wildcats.\nOffensively, K-State returns four of its top five hitters from a year ago, including junior infielder Justin Bloxom and senior outfielder Dane Yelovich. Bloxom led K-State in virtually every offensive category last season, including batting average (.288), hits (63), RBI (49), triples (2), total bases (105), total plate appearances (252), at bats (219), games played (58) and games started (57).

He was ranked as the Rangers' sixth-best prospect that season, by \"Baseball America\".\nBelcher was a September call-up for the 1990 Rangers, along with Double-A teammate Bill Haselman. Both Belcher and Haselman made their MLB debuts on September 3, as pinch hitters in the eighth inning of a Rangers win over the Cleveland Indians. Belcher made a total of 16 appearances for the Rangers through the end of the season, collecting two hits in 15 at bats, with one double. Those were Belcher's only major-league appearances, although they made him the first player from Navarro College to reach MLB.\nBelcher played professionally for three more seasons, at the Double-A and Triple-A levels. He spent his final season, 1993, with the Birmingham Barons, a Triple-A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. In seven seasons of play in Minor League Baseball, Belcher had a .251 batting average with 71 home runs and 298 runs batted in in 677 games.\nDuring the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Belcher appeared as a replacement player for the Houston Astros in spring training of 1995."

        "text": "The Big East women's basketball tournament is a conference championship tournament in women's basketball. It was first held in 1983, at the end of the 1982–83 college basketball season that was the first in which the Big East Conference sponsored women's basketball. Following the 2013 split of the original Big East along football lines, the women's basketball history of the original conference has been maintained by the non-football league that assumed the Big East name. The tournament determines the conference's champion, which receives an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nFrom 2004 through 2013, the tournament was held in the Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the XL Center (formerly known as the Hartford Civic Center). The first three tournaments after the relaunch of the Big East in 2013 were hosted by DePaul University. In 2014, opening-round games were played at McGrath–Phillips Arena on the school's Chicago campus and all other games played at Allstate Arena in suburban Rosemont. All games in the 2015 tournament were held at Allstate Arena, and all 2016 tournament games were held at McGrath–Phillips Arena. The 2017 tournament was the first since the relaunch to be held outside the Chicago area, with all games being played at Al McGuire Center on the Marquette University campus in Milwaukee. From 2018–2020, the tournament was held at Wintrust Arena at the McCormick Place convention center on Chicago’s Near South Side.\nStarting in 2009, the tournament expanded to include all 16 of the conference's teams at that time. The teams finishing 9 through 16 in the regular season standings played first round games, while teams 5 through 8 receive a bye to the second round. The top 4 teams during the regular season receive a double-bye to the quarterfinals. The 2013 tournament, the final one under the original Big East structure, saw 15 teams participate, following West Virginia's 2012 move to the Big 12 Conference. The tournament now features all 11 members of the reconfigured conference.\nIn June 2020, it was reported that the tournament will return to Connecticut at the Mohegan Sun Arena moving forward with the return of UConn.

        "text": "Jeffrey Bower (born April 26, 1961) is an American professional basketball coach and executive who last served as the vice president of basketball operations for the Phoenix Suns. Bower was also the former general manager for the Detroit Pistons from 2014 to 2018. He also served as the general manager and head coach of the New Orleans Hornets. Bower held the Hornets head coaching position during most of the 2009–10 season, and the general manager position twice, in 2002–03 and from 2005 to 2010.\nNew Orleans Hornets.\nGeneral manager.\nBower helped rebuild the Hornets, despite the troubles Hurricane Katrina placed on the club and the city of New Orleans in general. He took a giant step in re-writing Hornets history by trading franchise piece Baron Davis to the Warriors, then selecting guard Chris Paul fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft.\nThe disaster Katrina caused forced the Hornets to move to Oklahoma City until the 2007–08 NBA season, but Bower continued to build his club. Through trade, draft, and signings, the Hornets actually competed in their two seasons in Oklahoma with a 38–44 record in 2005–06 and 39–43 in 2006–07. Yet again, another series of trials and tribulations, the Hornets improved and contended. Injuries to Paul (for 18 games), Peja Stojaković (for sixty-nine), and scoring big man David West (for thirty) dampened the opportunity to make the playoffs.\nFor 2007–08, the Hornets came back home to open arms. They broke out, with the dangerous roster of Tyson Chandler (whom Bower traded for in 2006 for J. R. Smith), Paul, Stojakovic, West, and new acquisition Morris Peterson (from Toronto), with pieces like 3-point specialists Rasual Butler and Jannero Pargo (the former acquired in a 2005 trade, the latter left prior to the 2008–09 NBA season) and rebounders Melvin Ely and Ryan Bowen; and developing youth such as Julian Wright and Hilton Armstrong (both draft picks of the Hornets). The general of it all was Coach of the Year Byron Scott prior to the 2004–05 NBA season, and the Hornets won 56 games, their first divisional title, and were labeled \"contender\" by many analysts.\nBower's performance in spearheading the Hornets from lottery team to contender gave him 12 votes from the sportswriters for the \"Sporting News\" NBA Executive of the Year, behind Lakers' GM Mitch Kupchak and winner, Boston Celtics' Danny Ainge.\nBower helped draft David West, J. R. Smith, Chris Paul, Darren Collison and Marcus Thornton. Bower had been with the organization for 14 years, beginning in 1995–96, director of scouting, director of player personnel, as a scout, GM (in 2002–03), and assistant to former coaches Paul Silas and Tim Floyd. Bowers served as an advance scout for the Charlotte Hornets in 1995–97 and the Hornets Director of Scouting in 1997–2009. He also was an associate head coach at Marist College from 1990 to 1995, prior to that, being an assistant coach at both Marist and Penn State University.\nHead coach.\nOn November 12, 2009, Bower was made the head coach of the team after the firing of Byron Scott. He led the team to a 34–39 record despite injury problems in the team. At the end of the season, he stepped down from the coaching duty and returned to his position as a general manager. He was replaced by Monty Williams. Bower and the Hornets parted ways on July 13, 2010.\nMarist.\nOn April 10, 2013, it was announced that he will take over as coach of the Marist College men's basketball team. Bower served as an assistant coach for the Red Foxes from 1986 to 1990 and served as the associate head coach from 1990 to 1995. He was involved in the team's 1987 NCAA Tournament appearance and ECAC Metro Conference regular-season championships in 1987 and 1988. Bower also aided in the development of Rik Smits, the second overall pick in the 1988 NBA Draft by the Indiana Pacers.\nDetroit Pistons.\nOn June 3, 2014, Bower was named the general manager of the Detroit Pistons. On June 13, 2016, the Pistons signed Bower to a contract extension. Under Bower, the Pistons reached the playoffs in his second season as the general manager. However, on June 1, 2018, Bower was fired from his position as general manager of the team.\nPhoenix Suns.\nOn April 11, 2019, Bower was named a senior vice president of basketball operations for the Phoenix Suns Under this new title, Bower helped relay certain information towards general manager James Jones whenever necessary. In his second and final season with the Suns, they not only reached the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2010, but also the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993. Bower mutually agreed to resign from his position on July 24, 2021.\nPersonal life.\nBower and his wife, Lisa and have a daughter, Lindsey, born in January 2003. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and education from Saint Francis University in Pennsylvania."

        "title": "1924 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1924 Rose Bowl was a postseason American college football bowl game played between the independent Navy Midshipmen and the Washington Huskies, a member of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). The game took place on January 1, 1924, at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California, closing the 1923 college football season. The game opened in front of approximately 40,000 people and ended in a 1414 tie. It was the first post-season bowl game for both teams. The 1924 game was the tenth edition of the Rose Bowl, which had first been played in 1902. Following the inaugural game's blowout score, football was replaced with chariot races until 1916. The Rose Bowl stadium had been constructed in 1923, making this edition the second game played in the arena.\nThe game's organizers had previously selected a team from the East Coast and the West Coast, and asked the Washington Huskies to represent the West Coast. Washington requested that the Navy Midshipmen be their opponents, and Navy accepted. Washington selected Navy in favor of several teams from the east which had amassed better records. Both teams had suffered only a single loss during the season, but Washington had won eight games compared with Navy's five, although Navy had also amassed two ties. Predictions gave Washington a slight advantage in the game due to the weight difference between the teams: the Washington players were on average heavier than those of Navy.\nThe game kicked off in the afternoon; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before, causing a slight delay. The first quarter was scoreless, but Navy scored a touchdown on the first play of the second quarter. Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive. Near the end of the second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run, giving them a 147 halftime lead. The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored. Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter. Four plays afterward, Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Navy threw an interception at midfield, and Washington drove down to the Navy 20-yard line before attempting a game-winning field goal. The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards.\nFor his performance in the game, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was named the Most Valuable Player. Navy led in nearly every statistical aspect of the contest. Washington returned to the Rose Bowl at the end of the 1925 season, falling to the Alabama Crimson Tide 2019. Navy did not participate in another bowl game until 1955, when their squad, nicknamed the \"team named desire\", upset the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl. Since the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy and Washington have met five more times; the Huskies won three games.\nTeam selection.\nThe Rose Bowl game was first played in 1902, as a way to help fund the Rose Parade. Because of the first contest's lopsided score, a football game was not played again until 1916, having been replaced by chariot races. Between 1902 and 1947, the Rose Bowl was played between a team from the East Coast and a team from the West Coast. Until the construction of the Rose Bowl stadium, which began hosting the game in 1923, it was called the \"Tournament East–West football game\". Because the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was the only conference with teams located in the Western United States, a school from the conference had been chosen for every Rose Bowl game. The tournament committee invited the University of Washington Huskies to participate in the 1924 game, and they accepted. Washington was then allowed by the organization to select its opponent for the gamethe first time a team was allowed to do so. Washington chose the Navy Midshipmen based on a suggestion from the committee, and Navy accepted the invitation.\nNavy.\nThe Navy Midshipmen entered the Rose Bowl under coach Bob Folwell with five wins, one loss, and two ties (512). Navy's sole loss in the 1923 season came in their annual game against Penn State, which they lost 3-21. All five of Navy's wins came against eastern teams, including Colgate and William and Mary, and two of Navy's wins were shutouts, against Colgate and Saint Xavier. Navy tied 00 with Army in the 1923 Army–Navy Game, the last game of the season, played on November 23 in front of nearly 70,000 spectatorsincluding high-ranking military officials. Their other tie was a 33 game against Princeton. Navy was selected by Washington to participate in the Rose Bowl, although several teams with better records were eligible. Both Cornell and Yale finished the season with an undefeated 80 record. Eleven teams finished with only one loss, including Furman (101), Notre Dame (91), and the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) (91).\nWashington.\nThe Washington Huskies entered the 1924 Rose Bowl with a record of eight wins and one loss (81) under coach Enoch Bagshaw. Washington opened their season with victories over teams from the battleships and ; because these teams did not represent colleges, they were not considered an official part of Washington's schedule. Washington's first official game ended with a 340 shutout of Willamette, which was followed by four more shutouts. Washington's next game was a 2614 victory over PCC opponent Montanathe first points Washington allowed all season. The squad's following game was their sole loss: a 90 shutout by conference opponent California. Washington finished the regular season with two straight wins over conference opponents, including a victory in the Apple Cup over Washington State.\nPre-game buildup.\nThe 1924 Rose Bowl was the first meeting between Navy and Washington, and was the first bowl game that either team participated in. The competitors were announced on November 30, 1923, and the teams arrived for the bowl in mid-December, holding practices until the evening before the game. Heavy rain fell the night before the competition; Bagshaw said, \"Wet weather will not bother us\", and Folwell said, \"My men will know what to do in the mud and will be there doing it\". However, because of the wet conditions, several football critics predicted that Washington would have a slight advantage in the game due to their larger size. It was estimated that 52,000 people would attend the game. For the first time, the participating teams were responsible for ticket sales, and as a result only 40,000 people actually attended; a large number of tickets were sold to a navy fleet which was called to service on December 31, the day before the game. The competition was the first Rose Bowl to be broadcast on radio, and was aired by a local Pasadena station.\nNavy.\nDuring the 1923 football season, the Navy Midshipmen outscored their opponents 13343, led by quarterback Ira McKee, who threw several touchdown passes throughout the year. Navy's other offensive strong point was running back Carl Cullen, who ran for several hundred yards during the season. The Navy defense was considered weak by football critics, with an average player weight less than that of Washington. Navy's defense had stopped running plays successfully during the regular season, but had trouble defending pass plays. Navy's special teams were considered by critics to be decent, about even with those of Washington.\nWashington.\nThe Washington Huskies had outscored their opponents 20337 during the regular season, excluding the games against \"New York\" and \"Mississippi\". Washington's running backs, George \"Wildcat\" Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams were considered to be average.\nGame summary.\nThe kickoff for the Rose Bowl was originally scheduled for on January 1, 1924, but the night before the game, a meeting of the Rose Bowl organization rescheduled the kickoff time to the same day. This was likely due to poor field conditions caused by the previous night's rain. The opening ceremonies were the most elaborate of any bowl game up to that time, with numerous events held. Navy admiral Samuel Shelburne Robison received an admiral's salute from Navy's band when he took his seat. The Navy band and the color guard of the marines performed the National Anthem, then the marine color guard hoisted the U.S. flag over the field. Both teams' mascots were walked around the field before the kickoff. The Tournament of Roses predicted that tickets would be sold out by the day of the game, but actual ticket sales were much lower than they had hoped. Still, sales were higher than those of several previous competitions.\nFirst half.\nThe game began at the rescheduled time, with a temperature of and the field still wet. Because of the playing conditions, running plays were ineffective, which caused problems for the Washington offense. Navy instead used passing plays, which the Washington defense had trouble stopping. Navy was driving down to the 22-yard line of Washington when the first quarter ended. Navy controlled the first quarter, completing all six passing attempts and holding the Washington offense to under 100 yards gained.\nOn their first play of the second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a pass play from Ira McKee to Carl Cullen. McKee kicked the extra point for Navy, giving them a 7–0 lead. In an attempt to trick Washington, Navy tried an onside kick on the next play, but Washington recovered the ball. After two short running plays, Washington quarterback Fred Abel completed a 23-yard pass to running back Kinsley Dubois, bringing Washington inside the 25-yard line. On the next play, running back George Wilson ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Washington's kicker converted the extra point to tie the game at 7–7. After several drives from each team that did not result in further scoring, Navy completed a 57-yard pass down to the Washington eight-yard line. Two plays later, Ira McKee ran the ball in from two yards out for a touchdown, then afterward converted the extra point. The first half ended with Navy leading by 147, having completed all 11 passes they attempted.\nSecond half.\nBoth teams' defenses controlled the third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little success in the third quarter, being held to only a few yards gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.\nNavy received the ball from Washington and began to throw it erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30 yards. Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the upright, giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.\nStatistical summary.\nFor his performance in the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. McKee completed 16 of 20 passes for a total of 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85 rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he had little effect on the game. Against the urging of his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee. He left near the end of the game, and was later discovered to have broken his previously unaffected leg in multiple places.\nNavy's McKee threw for a perfect 11 of 11 passes during the first half, but completed just five of nine attempts during the second half. Two of these incompletions were interceptions. McKee outthrew Washington's Fred Abel by 110 yards. Carl Cullen was McKee's main receiver for the game, catching ten passes from him, one of which was taken for a touchdown. The other six passes were caught by other receivers. On the ground, Cullen rushed for the most yards of any player, gaining 102 throughout the course of the game. McKee was Navy's key runner, gaining 85 yards. Cullen, McKee and fullback Alan Shapley, and other team members rushed for a total of 187 yards during the game. McKee completed both extra point attempts, and the squad's punter kicked five times, for an average distance of 33.8 yards.\nAbel attempted eight passes during the game, and completed just three for a total of 65 yards. Of Abel's five incompletions, two were interceptions. Kinsley Dubois caught two of Abel's completed passes, amassing 53 receiving yards. Guard James Bryan caught the other, a 12-yard touchdown pass. George Wilson led Washington in rushing yards, gaining 87 over the course of the game, and scoring Washington's only rushing touchdown. Kinsley Dubois came next, gaining 30 yards, followed by Abel, with 20. The remainder of the team's 137 rushing yards were amassed by others, including Tesreau. Washington's kicker Leonard Zeil was two for two on extra points, but missed his only field goal attempt. Washington punted nine times, averaging 33 yards per attempt.\nAftermath.\nThe tie gave Washington an 811 record for the 1923 season. Navy's record went to 513, a slight improvement from the previous year, when the team went 52. It became Navy's eighth straight winning season.\nWashington went 811 in the 1924 season, remaining under the direction of coach Enoch Bagshaw. The team was invited to the 1926 Rose Bowl after completing an undefeated 1101 1925 season. They lost the game to the Alabama Crimson Tide by a score of 2019. Washington finished the 1920s with an overall record of 65266; Bagshaw coached the team for every season except 1920, when they were under the leadership of Stub Allison. Navy finished the 1924 season with a 26 record, ending their number of consecutive winning seasons at eight. The Navy football team was not invited to participate in another bowl game until 1955, when the \"team named desire\", so named due to coach Eddie Erdelatz comparing the squad to the play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", defeated the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl 210. Navy finished the 1920s with a record of 55228; nine of the ten seasons ended in winning records. Navy's coach, Bob Folwell, left the team after the 1924 season, to be replaced by Jack Owsley. Navy and Washington have since met five times, with Washington currently leading the series 321.\nBecause the 1924 Rose Bowl and several later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the southern end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.\nReferences.\nNotes\nFootnotes"

It was played at Tournament Park in Pasadena, California, a suburb northeast of Los Angeles.\nScoreless at halftime, Oregon scored a touchdown in each of the final two quarters and won 14–0. Oregon team captain John Beckett was named the Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953, with selections made retroactively. This shutout win was Oregon's sole Rose Bowl victory for 95 years, until January 2012; they made appearances in 1920, 1958, 1995, and 2010, and won again in 2015 and 2020. This was Penn's only appearance; other Ivy League teams at the Rose Bowl were Harvard in 1920 and Columbia in 1934, both winners.\nOregon and Washington were both unbeaten in the new Pacific Coast Conference that year, and tied in their head-to-head meeting. Oregon was invited to participate in the Tournament of Roses game prior to their despite the fact that Washington had one more conference win than Oregon, having beaten California twice. On the basis of the extra victory, Washington is credited with having won the conference that year.\nGame summary.\nOregon was led by the two Huntington brothers, Shy and Hollis. Following a scoreless first half, the Webfoots scored on a 15-yard pass in the 3rd quarter from Shy Huntington to Lloyd Tegert. Oregon scored again in the 4th quarter on a 1-yard run from Shy to lead the Webfoots to a 14–0 upset win. Shy Huntington also had three interceptions in the game. Oregon captain John Beckett was named MVP of the game.\nGame notes.\nAttendance was swelled to 25,000 when the Pasadena Tournament of Roses put up temporary grandstand seating."

        "text": "William John Smith (born December 12, 1950) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He won four Stanley Cups with the New York Islanders and was the first goalie to be credited with a goal in the NHL. In 2017 Smith was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.\nPlaying career.\nNHL beginnings.\nSmith was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the 5th round of the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft from the Cornwall Royals of the QMJHL. He played two seasons with the Kings' minor league affiliate, the American Hockey League's Springfield Kings, and spent a brief stint with the big-league Kings after winning a Calder Cup for Springfield in 1971.\nHe made his NHL debut with the Los Angeles Kings on February 12, 1972, at the Montreal Forum. L.A. lost the game 6-5. Smith faced 48 shots that afternoon, yielding the winning goal to Guy Lafleur with 22 seconds remaining in the game. He was drafted in the 1972 NHL Expansion Draft by the New York Islanders; he was the second player picked by the team.\nAfter sharing goaltending duties with Gerry Desjardins for two years, he got the starting job all to himself in 1974–75 when Desjardins bolted to the World Hockey Association. That season, he led the Islanders to their first playoff appearance.\nNew York Islanders.\nSmith played in the 1978 All-Star Game, where he was named MVP. For the rest of the decade, he shared time in the Islanders net with Chico Resch, where they combined to form perhaps the top goaltending duo in the NHL at the time. This changed in the 1980 playoffs, when the Isles rode Smith's goaltending to their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups, firmly establishing Smith as the team's starting goaltender. Resch was dealt to the Colorado Rockies the following season. Smith went on to become a First Team All-Star and Vezina Trophy winner in 1982. In 1983, he won the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed (shared with Roland Melanson). He was chosen to play for Canada in the 1981 Canada Cup, but was unable to play due to an injury sustained in a pre-tournament game.\nSmith's regular season success, however, was surpassed by his performances in the playoffs, as he helped the Islanders win four straight Stanley Cups (1980–83), reach the finals five straight times (1980–84), and win a record 19 consecutive playoff series from 1980–84.\nSmith was the first goalie to win the Stanley Cup wearing the helmet-and-cage combination mask, rather than the fiberglass mask which had been the standard from 1959, when it was introduced by Jacques Plante, until the early 1980s. Smith wore a fiberglass mask early in his career, but switched to the helmet-and-cage in 1978.\nHis single most famous game may be his 2–0 victory in the first game of the 1983 Stanley Cup finals against the Edmonton Oilers, shutting out the likes of Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri, and Paul Coffey. The Islanders went on to sweep the Oilers in 4 games, with Smith allowing the Oilers only 6 goals and winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as Most Valuable Player in the Playoffs. A year later, Smith broke the record for the most Playoff victories: he led all goaltenders in playoff victories in total and in every individual year between 1980 and 1984. Then in 1985, Smith led the Islanders to win 3 straight games after being down 0–2 to the Washington Capitals, the first time such a comeback occurred in the NHL. Smith's playoff success feeds into his reputation as the supreme \"money\" goalie (or \"clutch\" goaltender) of his era, the person you would want in net with the season on the line. Teammates and observers have said that Smith seemed able to sense when he needed to be perfect to win and when he could give up five goals and still come away with the victory.\nFirst NHL goal credited to a goaltender.\nSmith was the first NHL goaltender to be credited with scoring a goal. On November 28, 1979, in a game between the Islanders and the Colorado Rockies, the Rockies' goaltender left the ice for an extra attacker after a delayed penalty call was called on the Islanders. The puck deflected off of Smith's chest protector into the corner. Rockies rookie Rob Ramage picked up the puck and accidentally made a blind pass from the corner boards in the opposing zone to the blue line. Nobody was there to receive the pass, and so the puck sailed all the way down the length of the ice and into the Rockies' net. As Smith had been the last Islanders player to touch the puck, he was credited with the goal.\nRetirement.\nSmith retired in 1989; he was the last original Islander still on the team. After four years as the Islanders' goaltending coach, he followed longtime Islander general manager Bill Torrey to the expansion Florida Panthers in the same role, serving there until his retirement in 2000. He had spent 30 years at ice level in the NHL, the last 28 of them alongside Torrey with the Islanders (1972-1992) and the Panthers (1992-2000).\nThe Islanders retired his #31 on February 20, 1993. Later that year, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, the only goalie inducted in the Hall in the 1990s. In 1998, he was ranked number 80 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.\nPersonality.\nHe was nicknamed \"Battlin' Billy\" or \"Hatchet Man\" for his fiery temper and unabashed use of the stick or blocker on players crowding his crease; as such, forwards needed ankle guards to protect themselves.\nSmith was also noted for his displays of feigned injuries that would often lead to penalties against opponents, for whom he carried an undisguised enmity. For instance, in Game Four of the 1983 Stanley Cup Finals, Smith's dive resulted in referee Andy Van Hellemond handing a five-minute penalty to Glenn Anderson of the Edmonton Oilers. Van Hellemond said that this was \"making a bit of a fool of me\", and when he officiated Game One of the 1984 Finals, a rematch of the Islanders and Oilers, he called no penalty when Smith and Anderson collided.\nSmith refused to participate in the traditional handshakes between teams at the end of a playoff series.\nA notable incident with Smith occurred in practice where then-teammate Mike Bossy fired a shot at Smith to which Smith objected. Smith charged after Bossy with his stick but was tackled by teammates before Smith took his frustrations out on Bossy. Bossy also noted that Smith never liked being talked to in the locker room, and keeping an intense focus before and after games and practices, but is much more laid-back off the ice."

        "title": "Mountain climbing problem",
        "text": "In mathematics, the mountain climbing problem is a mathematical problem that considers a two-dimensional mountain range (represented as a continuous function), and asks whether it is possible for two mountain climbers starting at sea level on the left and right sides of the mountain to meet at the summit, while maintaining equal altitudes at all times. This problem was named and posed in this form by , but its history goes back to , who solved a version of it. The problem has been repeatedly rediscovered and solved independently in different contexts by a number of people (see references below).\nSince the 1990s, the problem was shown to be connected to the weak Fréchet distance of curves in the plane, various planar motion planning problems in computational geometry, the inscribed square problem, semigroup of polynomials, etc. The problem was popularized in the article by , which received the Mathematical Association of America's Lester R. Ford Award in 1990.\nAnalysis.\nThe problem can be rephrased as asking whether, for a given pair of continuous functions formula_1 with formula_2 (corresponding to rescaled versions of the left and right faces of the mountain), it is possible to find another pair of functions formula_3 with formula_4 (the climbers' horizontal positions at time formula_5) such that the function compositions formula_6 and formula_7 (the climbers' altitudes at time formula_5) are the same function.\nFinite number of peaks and valleys.\nWhen formula_1 have only a finite number of peaks and valleys (local maxima and local minima) it is always possible to coordinate the climbers' movements. This can be shown by drawing out a sort of game tree: an undirected graph formula_10 with one vertex labeled formula_11 whenever formula_12 and either formula_13 or formula_14 is a local maximum or minimum. Two vertices will be connected by an edge if and only if one node is immediately reachable from the other; the degree of a vertex will be greater than one only when the climbers have a non-trivial choice to make from that position.\nAccording to the handshaking lemma, every connected component of an undirected graph has an even number of odd-degree vertices. Since the only odd-degree vertices in all of formula_10 are formula_15 and formula_16, these two vertices must belong to the same connected component. That is, formula_10 must contain a path from formula_15 to formula_16. That path tells how to coordinate the climbers' movement to the summit.\nIt has been observed that for a mountain with peaks and valleys the length of this path (roughly corresponding to the number of times one or the other climber must \"backtrack\") can be as large as quadratic in .\nThis technique breaks down when formula_1 have an infinite number of local extrema. In that case, formula_10 would not be a finite graph, so the handshaking lemma would not apply: formula_15 and formula_16 might be connected but only by a path with an infinite number of vertices, possibly taking the climbers \"infinite time\" to traverse.\nInfinite number of peaks and valleys.\nThe following result is due to :\nOn the other hand, it is not possible to extend this result to all continuous functions. For, if formula_28 has constant height over an interval while formula_29 has infinitely many oscillations passing through the same height, then the first climber may be forced to go back and forth over that interval infinitely many times, making his path to the summit infinitely long. gives a concrete example involving formula_44."

        "text": "The 2008–09 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team represented Michigan State University in the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They were led by head coach Tom Izzo who was in his 14th year as head coach. The team played their home games at the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan and were member of the Big Ten Conference. MSU finished the season 31–7, 15–3 in Big Ten play to win the Big Ten regular season championship by four games. They defeated Minnesota in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament before losing to Ohio State in the semifinals. The Spartans received their 12th-straight NCAA tournament bid, an at-large bid as the No. 2 seed in the Midwest region. They defeated Robert Morris, USC, Kansas, and Louisville to advance to the Final Four for the fifth time under Izzo. In the Final Four, they defeated UConn to advance to the National Championship game where they lost to North Carolina.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2007–08 season 27–9, 12–6 in Big Ten play to finish in fourth place. Michigan State received a No. 5 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 11th straight trip to the Tournament, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, their seventh trip under Tom Izzo, before losing to Memphis.\nThe Spartans lost Drew Neitzel (13.9 points and 4 assists per game) to graduation following the season.\nSeason summary.\nMichigan State was led by sophomore Kalin Lucas (14.7 points and 4.6 assists per game), junior Raymar Morgan (10.2 points and 5.3 rebounds per game), and senior Goran Suton (10.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game).\nRegular season.\nThe team began the season ranked No. 6 in the country and began the season well with home wins against Idaho and IPFW (coached by future MSU assistant coach Dane Fife).\nThe Spartans next traveled to Florida to participate in the Old Spice Classic. In the first round, they faced unranked Maryland who controlled the game, defeating MSU 80–62. The Spartans rebounded from the loss to Maryland by beating Oklahoma State 94–79 in the consolation bracket. In the consolation championship, MSU defeated Wichita State 65–57 behind 12 points from Marquise Gray.\nThe Spartans then faced No. 1 North Carolina in the Big Ten-ACC Challenge at the site of the upcoming Final Four, Ford Field. There, MSU was blown out, 98–63. Izzo took the blame for the loss, \"The blame goes on me for the scheduling. We were dead.\"\nMichigan State returned home after playing five straight games away from the Breslin Center. Following easy wins over Bradley, Alcorn State, and The Citadel, MSU then went on the road again to face No. 5-ranked Texas at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. MSU, ranked 19th in the AP poll, were led by Goran Suton's 18 points, but still trailed as time wound down in the game. Durrell Summers hit a three-pointer with 18.6 second remaining to help pull out a 67–63 win.\nThe Spartans next defeated Oakland at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit, 82–66, to move to 9–2 and were ranked No. 10 in the country to finish the non-conference schedule.\nMSU opened conference play on New Year's Eve with a win over No. 21 Minnesota behind a career-high 24 points from Kalin Lucas. Wins over Northwestern and Ohio State followed before the Spartans stepped back out of conference to welcome defending national champion Kansas to the Breslin Center on January 11. MSU fell behind early 7–1 and 11–6, but fought back before taking control of the game at the half with a 37–18 lead. Lucas again led the Spartans, scoring 22 points as the Spartans won 75–62 for their ninth straight win, pushing their record to 13–2 on the season.\nWins over Penn State and No. 20 Illinois pushed the win streak to 11. Prior to the win over Illinois, the Spartans retired Morris Peterson's jersey. The win over Illinois also gave MSU a 5–0 record in Big Ten play, their best start in conference since 1978. Looking to extend their win streak to 12 games, MSU welcomed Northwestern to the Breslin Centeron January 21. The Spartans, hampered by Raymar Morgan's sickness, were stunned by Northwestern, losing 70–63. The loss ended the Spartans 28-game home winning streak as well and left them at 5–1 in conference, 15–3 overall.\nMSU returned to their winning ways defeating Ohio State and Iowa on the road to mark five straight Big Ten road wins. Another surprising loss at home, this time to Penn State, preceded a second win over No. 21-ranked Minnesota. At 18–4 and 8–2 on the season, the Spartans returned to the top ten rankings, moving to No. 9 in the AP poll. The Spartans then welcomed former Izzo assistant Tom Crean, coach of Indiana, to the Breslin Center on February 7. MSU, led by freshman Draymond Green's 15 points and 12 rebounds, blew out the Hoosiers, 75–47.\nThe Spartans then took their perfect road record to Michigan. MSU led the majority of the game, but Michigan rallied to within four with under five minutes remaining. But Kalin Lucas, who scored 13 of his 15 points after half time, made a three to extend the lead and Delvon Roe scored a season-high 14 points as MSU won 54–42.\nThe win over Michigan moved MSU to No. 6 in the AP poll (No. 5 in the Coaches Poll) and set up an important road game against No. 19 Purdue. The Boilermakers forced 22 Spartan turnovers, blocked eight shots and held MSU to 33% from the field. Lucas scored 13 for MSU, but it wasn't enough as they were blown out 72–54. The Purdue loss broke the road-winning streak, but still left MSU at 20–5 and 10–3 in conference.\nThe Purdue loss would also mark the last regular season loss by the Spartans. Wins over Wisconsin and Iowa preceded the No. 9-ranked Spartans trip to No. 20 Illinois. Lucas led the Spartans again with 18 points as they defeated Illinois 74–66 clinching a share of the Big Ten regular season championship. With a 64–59 win at Indiana on March 3, the Spartans won their first Big Ten regular season title since 2001 and first outright title since 1999. In the final game of the season, a 62–51 win over No. 19 Purdue, Lucas scored 21 points to lead MSU to the Big Ten championship by four games with a 15–3 record, 25–5 overall, and ranked No. 7 in the country.\nFollowing the conclusion of the regular season, Kalin Lucas was named Big Ten Player of the Year and Tom Izzo was voted Big Ten Coach of the Year. Travis Walton was named Defensive Player of the Year, while Goran Suton was a second team All-Big Ten selection. Delvon Roe was named to the Big Ten freshmen team.\nBig Ten tournament.\nAs the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, MSU had a bye into the quarterfinals. Looking to make their case for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, MSU defeated No. 8-seeded Minnesota 64–56 led by Chris Allen's 17 points. The win moved the Spartans to the Big Ten semifinals to face Ohio State. However, Michigan State's hopes for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament vanished as they were defeated by Ohio State, 82–70. Evan Turner had 18 points to lead the Buckeyes to win the over the Spartans, who shot just 38 percent from the field.\nNCAA Tournament.\nMichigan State received an at-large bid as the No. 2 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament, their 12th straight appearance in the Tournament. Though they only received a No. 2 seed, the path to the Final Four looked good for the Spartans with games in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Indianapolis, Indiana before the Final Four in Detroit.\nIn the First Round, the Spartans defeated No. 15-seed Robert Morris 77–62 behind Raymar Morgan's 16 points and Goran Suton's 11 points and 17 rebounds. Draymond Green added 16 points in the easy win. In the Second Round, MSU faced No. 10-seed USC for the right to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. With a surprising offensive output by Travis Walton, scoring a career-high 18 points, the Spartans were able to hold off USC to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.\nIn the Sweet Sixteen, MSU faced No. 14-ranked and No. 3-seeded Kansas, marking MSU's eighth trip to the Sweet Sixteen in the previous 12 years. The game was held in Indianapolis where MSU was 5–0 all-time in NCAA Tournament games. Michigan State trailed by as many as 13 in the first half as Lucas struggled from the field. MSU trailed 36–29 at the half, but started strong in the second half as Draymond Green cut the Kansas lead to just one point just three minutes into the half. Lucas sealed the win by scoring seven points in the final 49 seconds of the game (going five for five from the free throw line) as MSU advanced to the Elite Eight with a 67–62 win.\nIn the Elite Eight, the Spartans faced overall No. 1 seed Louisville with a chance to go to the Final Four in nearby Detroit, only 90 miles from MSU's campus. Led by MSU's rugged defense, Louisville, who had scored 103 points in their win over Arizona in the Sweet Sixteen, was held to 52 points and lost for the first time in 14 games. The Spartans, who slowed the game down, were led by Suton's 19 points and 10 rebounds and won 64–52. The win sent MSU to the Final Four for the fifth time in 11 seasons. \"Detroit, here we come,\" said coach Tom Izzo, a Michigan native. \"I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to that.\" Durrell Summers contributed 10 second-half points in the win.\nIn Detroit for the Final Four, the Spartans practiced before a crowd of over 30,000 fans as they were clearly the hometown favorites. In the national semifinals, Michigan State faced Connecticut, another No. 1 seed, for the right to play for the national championship. Kalin Lucas led the Spartans with 21 points and Raymar Morgan added 18 as the smaller Spartans took it to the much bigger Huskies, led by Hasheem Thabeet. MSU led by two at the half and pulled away in the second to win 82–73 to advance to the national championship game. In contrast to the slowed down play against Louisville in the Elite Eight, MSU pushed the ball and wore out Thabeet and the Huskies.\nIn the National Championship game, the Spartans were rematched with North Carolina, whom they had also lost to earlier in the season at Ford Field. Michigan State was appearing in only its third national championship game, going 2–0 in prior trips while winning the 1979 and 2000 Tournaments. Further, under Tom Izzo, MSU was 14–2 in the second game of a weekend in NCAA Tournament play. However, the game started horribly for MSU as North Carolina jumped out to a lead of 17–7 in the first five minutes and extend the lead to 24–7 with 14 minutes remaining in the half. North Carolina scored more points than any team had ever scored in the first half of an NCAA championship game, scoring 55 and blowing out the Spartans 55–34 at the half. MSU's 14 turnovers in the first half aided the Tar Heels 52.9% shooting. The Spartans only made 12 baskets in the first half. The Spartans held UNC in check more in the second half, outscoring the Tar Heels 38–34, but it was too little too late. The Spartans were defeated by North Carolina 89–72, marking the Spartans' first ever loss in the national championship game.\nThe Spartans faced three No. 1 seeds (Louisville, UConn, and North Carolina) in the Tournament, only losing to North Carolina.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;Source"

UK Golf Guide describes it as a \"links course with superlative view over Moray Firth\"\nThe course was created in the 1930s and part of the purpose of the project was to create jobs in a time of high unemployment, especially in the herring fishing industry. Golf website St Andrews.com describes Buckpool thus whilst reflecting on its origins as a job creation scheme, \"for a course of this quality some of today's multi-millionaire course designers would be shaking in their soft-spikes if such schemes were resurrected.\" In the early sixties the Town Council, which had maintained both Buckpool and Buckie's other course Strathlene decided to close Buckpool due to economic reasons. A group of enthusiasts formed a private club and leased the course which has come a long way from the old farmhouse which was the clubhouse to the present building situated besides the 10th and 18th greens. In 1999 the land was purchased from Moray Council by the members.\nBuckpool provides a full calendar of tournaments throughout the season for both Ladies and Gents sections and regular competition for Seniors and Juniors as well.\nToday the course plays to a par of 70 and is 6127 yards in length.\nBuckpool Golf Club is notable as being the venue for Paul Lawrie's maiden professional tournament victory when he won the 1986 Moray Seafoods Open which was, incidentally, his first ever tournament as a pro."

After a solid season, he was selected to the East-West All-Star Game, being the youngest player ever to achieve that distinction.\nAfterwards, Johnson played a key role in the 1941 and 1942 Negro League World Series titles won by the Monarchs, a team that included future Hall of Famers Satchel Paige and Hilton Smith. In 1943, Johnson enlisted in the Army during World War II for three years.\nFollowing his discharge in 1946, Johnson returned to the Monarchs and went 9-3 with a 3.46 earned run average, helping his team win another pennant, even though he did not pitch in the Series. He went 4-1 in the next two seasons, but rebounded in 1950 with an 11-2 mark and a 2.17 ERA while appearing in his second All-Star Game.\nCanadian Provincial League.\nIn 1951, Johnson played for the St. Hyacinthe Saints club based in the Canadian Provincial League, where he posted a 15-14 record with a 3.24 ERA and a league-high 172 strikeouts. At the end of the season, his contract was purchased by the Chicago White Sox.\nMajor League Baseball.\nChicago White Sox.\nIn 1952, Johnson was assigned to Class A Colorado Springs, where he finished 18-9 with a 3.38 ERA and set a Western League record with 233 strikeouts. He then was promoted to the White Sox, and made his major league debut at the age of 30 on April 17, 1953.\nDuring his rookie season at Chicago Johnson pitched in 14 games, starting ten of them, going 4–4 with a 3.56 ERA and 44 strikeouts. After spending the entire 1954 season in the minors with Triple A Charleston Senators, Johnson started 16 games for Chicago in 1955. He finished the season 7–4 with a 3.45 ERA and 72 strikeouts.\nIn his first two years Johnson sandwiched between Triple A Toronto Maple Leafs and the Sox. As a result, in 1956 he pitched in five games with Chicago and went 0–1 with six strikeouts and a 3.65 ERA.\nOverall, Johnson went 11–9 with a 3.51 ERA and 122 strikeouts in 36 games (28 starts) with the White Sox, starting 28 of them, and going 11–9 with 122 strikeouts. During the midseason, Johnson was traded by Chicago along with Mike Fornieles, George Kell and Bob Nieman to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for Jim Wilson and Dave Philley.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nJohnson started 25 games for the Orioles in 1956, going 9–10 with a 3.43 ERA and 130 strikeouts in innings, including two shutouts and nine complete games.\nOn June 21, 1956, Johnson was on the losing end of a double one-hitter, Jack Harshman winning, 1-0.\nHis most productive season came in 1957, when he finished 14–11 with a 3.20 ERA \nfor a lousy team that finished in fifth place in the then eight team American League. Besides, Johnson posted career numbers in starts (30), complete games (14), shutouts (3) and innings (242.0).\nDuring his final season in 1958, Johnson was the Opening Day starter for the Orioles and defeated the Washington Senators, 6–1, at Memorial Stadium. Overall, he went 6–9 with a 3.88 ERA and 68 strikeouts.\nIn a five-year major league career, Johnson finished with a 40-39 record and 3.44 ERA in 123 pitching appearances (100 starts), including 34 complete games and eight shutouts, while striking out 497 and walking 257 in 716.0 innings of work\nFinal years.\nJohnson then returned to the minors to play for the Vancouver Mounties of the Pacific Coast League from 1959 to 1960. He finished his career in 1961, while pitching with the Pericos de Puebla in the Mexican League. In 182 minor league games, he went 76-44 with a 3.34 ERA in 1034.0 innings.\nCaribbean highlights.\nIn between, Johnson played winter ball with the Spur Cola Colonites club of the Panamanian League, who won the 1950-51 pennant and represented Panama in the 1951 Caribbean Series. The team's only victory in the series came behind a strong pitching effort from Johnson, who pitched a two-run, eight-hit complete game over the highly favored Leones del Habana Cuban team.\nAfterwards, Johnson pitched for the Tigres de Marianao in the 1954-55 Cuban League season, and was a bright spot for the last-place Marianao, going 12-11 with a 3.29 ERA while leading the league in strikeouts (123), shutouts (5) and innings pitched (174⅔).\nAfter his playing days, Johnson worked for the Ford Motor Company in Kansas City, Missouri, retiring in 1985. He died in 2004 at the age of 81.\nExternal links.\n, or Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and Seamheads"

        "text": "A trapper, also referred to as catch glove or simply glove, is a piece of equipment that an ice hockey goaltender wears on the non-dominant hand to assist in catching and stopping the puck. \nEvolution.\nThe trapper originally had the same shape as a baseball glove, but evolved into a highly specific piece of equipment that is designed specifically for catching the puck. Changes made over time include the addition of a \"string mesh\" in the pocket of the trapper and substantially more palm and wrist protection. The \"cheater\" portion of the glove covers the wrist, which evolved from gauntlet-like gloves from the 1920s.\nTechnique.\nThe pocket is the area of the trapper between the thumb and first finger of the glove, and is where most goaltenders try to catch the puck, as it reduces the discomfort the goaltender experiences and minimizes the chance of the puck falling out of the glove, creating the possibility of a rebound.\nPositioning.\nWorn on the non-dominant hand, the trapper can be held in a variety of positions depending upon, individual style and preference. Younger goaltenders tend to hold the glove with the palm facing towards the shooter, instead of in the traditional \"shake hands\" position."

He also mentioned Monterrey, Ciudad Juárez, Querétaro, Tijuana, Pachuca and Aguascalientes as other possible venues.\nThe Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, after having previously hosted major events, such as 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cup, 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship, 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup and 1968 Summer Olympics Football final matches, hosted the third place match and the final match of the tournament.\nTeams.\nIn addition to host nation Mexico, 23 nations qualified from 6 separate continental competitions.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage took place on 17 May 2011 at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México's Sala Nezahualcóyotl concert Hall.\nThe seeding was as follows:\nThe winners and runners-up from each group, as well as the best four third-placed teams, qualified for the first round of the knockout stage (round of 16).\nWhere two or more teams end the group stage with the same number of points, their ranking is determined by the following criteria:\nRanking of third place teams in each group are determined by the following criteria, top four advances to the round of 16:\n\"All kick-off times are local\" ().\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDrawing of lots was used to determine the final positions of the United States and New Zealand, as the two teams finished level on points, goal difference, goals scored, and head-to-head record.\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nKnockout stage.\nIn a rule to avoid potential \"player burnout\", all games in the knockout stage proceeded straight to penalties if tied after normal time, thus avoiding the need for 30 minutes of extra time."

        "text": "The 2009 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the 2009 Formula 1 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was the fifteenth round of the 2009 FIA Formula One World Championship. The race was held at the Suzuka Circuit on 4 October 2009.\nSebastian Vettel of Red Bull won the race ahead of Toyota's Jarno Trulli and World Champion Lewis Hamilton, leading through the whole race.\nWith two races remaining in the 2009 season, Vettel's win maintained his slim hopes of winning the Drivers Championship, with Championship leader Jenson Button finishing eighth, one place behind Rubens Barrichello. The result left Button and Barrichello's Brawn team half a point away from clinching the Constructors Championship.\nReport.\nBackground.\nJenson Button led Brawn GP teammate Rubens Barrichello by 15 points going into the race, with Sebastian Vettel 10 points further back driving for Red Bull Racing. Mark Webber could no longer win the Championship.\nBrawn also led Red Bull by 42½ points in the Constructors' Championship, and only needed to maintain this lead to take the trophy. McLaren and Ferrari were 3 points apart in the Constructors' Championship in 3rd and 4th, with their lead drivers Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen also separated by 3 points in 5th and 6th in the Drivers' Championship; Ferrari led on both counts.\nFernando Alonso won the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix for Renault, which was held at Fuji Speedway. Alonso also won the last race at Suzuka, in 2006. Other former winners lining up include Brawn GP's Rubens Barrichello, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen and World Champion Lewis Hamilton. It was the first time since 1991 that a Schumacher (Michael or Ralf) was not on the grid at Suzuka.\nEight of the drivers had not raced at Suzuka in Formula One before, owing to the Fuji Speedway having hosted the Japanese Grand Prix in 2007 and 2008. Those drivers included Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, Heikki Kovalainen, local driver Kazuki Nakajima, Adrian Sutil, Sébastien Buemi, Jaime Alguersuari and Romain Grosjean. However, both Vettel and Sutil had driven the circuit in practice sessions before when they served as test drivers in 2006.\nThe 2009 Japanese Grand Prix saw Lewis Hamilton, Heikki Kovalainen and Adrian Sutil all start their fiftieth race in Formula One.\nTyre supplier Bridgestone selected the hard and soft tyres for the Grand Prix weekend.\nPractice.\nThe Friday practice sessions were dominated by heavy rain that severely reduced running time. Toyota's Timo Glock was advised not to drive as he was suffering from a fever, and was replaced by GP2 Series driver Kamui Kobayashi.\nThe first practice session saw Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton set the early pace, with lap times rapidly falling as the track dried out. The second half of the session was dominated by local driver Kazuki Nakajima, who narrowly missed out on setting the fastest time after McLaren's Heikki Kovalainen set a time three tenths of a second quicker in the final phase. Championship contenders Rubens Barrichello, Sebastian Vettel and Jenson Button finished 10th, 17th and 18th respectively.\nThe rain increased markedly for the second session, which saw very limited running in the first hour with Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari and Sébastien Buemi being the only drivers to set times. Owing to poor visibility and limited tyre allocations, many of the drivers elected to do only a handful of laps; Nico Rosberg did just seven in comparison to the twenty he had done in the first session, a pattern followed by many other drivers. Heikki Kovalainen and both Brawn GP drivers elected not to take to the circuit. Adrian Sutil went on to set the fastest lap of the session with Sebastian Vettel in second, both of them some seven seconds slower than Kovalainen's first session time.\nSaturday's third and final practice session started with contact between championship leader Button and Alguersuari that saw the Brawn driver require a replacement front wing. The session was largely dominated by Alguersuari's Toro Rosso stablemate Buemi, with fellow Red Bull compatriot Sebastian Vettel a close second until Jarno Trulli set a time six hundredths of a second quicker on his final lap. The hour-long session was dry, with Trulli's 1:31.709 almost ten seconds faster than Heikki Kovalainen's FP1 time and 17 seconds quicker than Adrian Sutil in FP2. At the end of the hour, championship contenders Vettel, Barrichello and Button were fourth, seventh and ninth respectively and separated by just over two hundredths of a second; just one second ultimately covered the top 16 drivers. Elsewhere, Timo Glock returned to his seat whilst Romain Grosjean out-paced Renault teammate Fernando Alonso. Red Bull's Mark Webber crashed near the Degner Corner, damaging his car to such an extent that he was unable to take part in qualifying. As the damage was heavy enough to require the chassis to be re-built, Webber had to start the race from the pit lane.\nQualifying.\nWith Webber unable to take part in qualifying, only four drivers would be eliminated in the first session. An early spin into the barriers by Sébastien Buemi looked as if that number would become three, but his team repaired the car in time for him to do a single fast lap. The early pace-setter was Sebastian Vettel, who exchanged blows with the Toyota of Trulli before ultimately coming out on top by the end of the session. Meanwhile, Jaime Alguersuari made the second part of qualifying for the first time in his short career, with Giancarlo Fisichella, Kazuki Nakajima, Romain Grosjean and Vitantonio Liuzzi joining Webber in an early exit from qualifying.\nThe second session was dominated by two accidents that both resulted in red flags. The first was Jaime Alguersuari, who speared off at the Degner Curve, the same place as Webber in the earlier practice session and the scene of Buemi's off-track excursion in the first segment of qualifying. The second accident was more serious, with Timo Glock crashing heavily at the final corner. The session was stopped for some time as medics attended to him and his car was removed. The session resumed with eight minutes remaining and saw a final push by the Brawn drivers to make it into the top ten shootout. The final moments were marked by another off by Buemi at Spoon, which left debris on the circuit as he limped back to the pits. Glock was flown by helicopter to hospital during Q3 with a wound on his left leg, and back pain. The times set by the Brawn drivers were threatened should someone protest following an incident where they set their best – and only – times during a yellow flag period.\nHeikki Kovalainen joined the growing list of drivers who crashed at the Degner Curve early in the third part of qualifying, though the damage was minimal and the circuit quickly cleared. The damage to Sébastien Buemi's car after his earlier off was deemed too great to be able to repair in time, and like Kovalainen, he failed to set a time, meaning that Q3 would be contested by eight drivers. When the track had re-opened after Kovalainen's accident, there were just five minutes remaining on the clock. Sebastian Vettel once again topped the timing sheets, putting him in a strong position to keep his title campaign alive, while rival championship contenders Barrichello and Button could only manage fifth and seventh respectively. Jarno Trulli qualified the sole remaining Toyota in second in his team's home race, with reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton in third.\nAfter qualifying, Jenson Button, Rubens Barrichello, Nick Heidfeld, Robert Kubica, Fernando Alonso and Adrian Sutil were all called before the stewards on charges of speeding during the yellow-flag caused by Sébastien Buemi's off in the final moments of Q2. Buemi himself was later summoned on the charge of driving a damaged car. All of the drivers except for Heidfeld and Kubica were given five-place grid penalties.\nTimo Glock was unable to take part in the race as a result of the injuries he sustained during qualifying. Toyota requested to have him replaced by Kobayashi, but this was refused by the stewards as the rules stipulated that a driver had to have taken part in a Saturday session to be eligible to race.\nRace.\nSebastian Vettel led the race from the start; aside from a brief attempt by Lewis Hamilton at passing him into the first corner, the Red Bull driver would remain relatively unthreatened. The opening lap was clean, with the only major changes in position coming from Sébastien Buemi, who nearly stalled, and Jenson Button, who fell from 10th down to 12th behind the BMW Sauber of Robert Kubica and the Ferrari of Giancarlo Fisichella. Button subsequently reclaimed those positions within the opening laps.\nHamilton slotted into second place while Jarno Trulli assumed third. Further back, Mark Webber, having started from the pit lane, pitted three times in the opening four laps; the first two due to his headrest coming loose, and the third for new tyres after he picked up a puncture. Most of the overtaking in the early stages of the Grand Prix took place with the first wave of stops, Vettel remaining unchallenged for the lead. An incident at the Casio Triangle saw Adrian Sutil and Heikki Kovalainen collide at relatively low speed, allowing championship leader Button to sneak through into a points position.\nThe middle stint of the race was as quiet as the first, with the only passes being Kovalainen out-dragging Fisichella in the pit exit lane, and a mistake from Hamilton allowing Trulli to pass him as he emerged from the pits. A problem with the KERS unit on his car meant that Hamilton subsequently struggled to stay in touch with the Toyota driver. Meanwhile, the Toro Rosso drivers had not fared well, with a clutch problem spelling an early retirement for Buemi, whilst Jaime Alguersuari lost control after touching the astro turf on the outside of 130R which resulted in a spin into the tyre wall and the safety car being deployed ten laps from the end.\nBy the time the wreckage from Alguersuari's accident was cleared away and the track considered safe for racing once more, there were just five laps remaining. Vettel continued to put as much space between him and second place as possible, while ninth-placed Kubica threatened Jenson Button in an attempt to wrest the single championship point for eighth place away from him. Button prevailed after deciding not to challenge teammate Rubens Barrichello for seventh. He later protested to the stewards that Williams' Nico Rosberg had been speeding under the safety car – though Rosberg was acquitted after a stewards' hearing found mitigating circumstances.\nVettel ultimately won the race from Trulli and Hamilton with Kimi Räikkönen in fourth. Mark Webber, although down in last and 2 laps down, took the fastest lap on the last lap by 0.002 seconds to deny Vettel a Grand Chelem. His victory and subsequent ten championship points meant Vettel stayed in contention for the drivers' title, 16 points adrift of Button, who kept a 14-point lead over Barrichello going into the penultimate race. Vettel was confident he could make up the large points difference, saying his Red Bull team had the momentum, while Button admitted he would be focusing on an error-free end to the season to try to clinch his first Driver's title.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\n\"Cars that use the KERS system are marked with \"‡\"\"\nRace.\n\"Cars that use the KERS system are marked with \"‡\"\""

        "text": "Michael Thomas Rice Sr. is a former National Basketball Association color commentator, one half of the Portland Trail Blazers' television broadcasting team. A former player and coach, he is the only broadcaster ejected from an NBA game.\nBiography.\nPlaying career.\nA basketball player at Duquesne University, Rice earned an All-American honorable mention selection his senior year, leading his Dukes to the 1962 NIT tournament. During the semi-final of the NIT, Duquesne lost to the St. John's Red Storm. During the game, Rice became involved in a fight with St. John's player Donnie Burks that lasted at least a minute. It was ultimately broken up by the New York City Police Department, who stepped in when members of the Madison Square Garden crowd tried to join the fight. No one was injured and referees did not call fouls on either Rice or Burks. The Associated Press described the event as a \"lively brawl\".\nAlthough the NBA was calling and the Detroit Pistons selected him in the eighth round of the 1962 NBA draft, Rice decided that his skills could be better utilized from an educational standpoint and opted for a career in coaching.\nCoaching career.\nRice coached for 13 years at the high school level, posting a career record of 245–71, before moving to college coaching in 1977 when he accepted a position as an assistant coach at Duquesne. He was named the head coach of Duquesne for the 1978–79 season and over his four-year tenure he amassed a record of 62–49, garnering two berths in the National Invitation Tournament and twice being named Eastern Eight Coach of the Year.\nRice then moved to Youngstown State University, where he coached for five years, from 1982–83 through 1986–87. During this period the Penguins twice finished second in the Ohio Valley Conference, peaking with a high of 19 victories in the 1984–85 season. The team amassed 75 wins against 67 losses during the Mike Rice years.\nDuring his final season at Youngstown State, Rice was instrumental in reviving the Greater YSU Holiday Classic basketball tournament, an event which continued annually through the 1991–92 season.\nBroadcasting career.\nAfter his dismissal at Youngstown State in March 1987, Rice looked for work outside of basketball. He was hired as the vice president of sales and marketing for David Zarzmer Industries, a Youngstown based manufacturers' representative firm.\nRice moved from coaching to broadcasting for the 1987–88 season when he took a job working for ESPN as a college basketball analyst. Rice worked games as primary analyst for the Western Athletic Conference. From 1989 he also worked with SportsChannel America as its primary analyst for World Basketball League broadcasts.\nRice moved to the team-owned broadcasting operations of the Portland Trail Blazers in 1991. Rice was chosen by longtime voice of the Blazers Bill Schonely following a four-person tryout at the Blazers' 1991 Slam 'n' Jam held at Civic Stadium, organized by Blazer team president Marshall Glickman. Rice bested former Oregon State University guard Mark Radford, ex-Blazers assistant coach Jack McKinney, and retired NBA referee Earl Strom in the tryout, which gave each a quarter of the game to work alongside Schonely.\nWhile Rice started as part of the radio team, since the 2006–07 season he has worked with play-by-play announcer Mike Barrett providing color commentary for the television broadcast.\nKnown affectionately as \"The Wild One\", Rice has been referred to by journalist Kerry Eggers as \"part basketball expert, part entertainer, 100 percent character.\" Echoing these sentiments, Blazer television producer Scott Zachary has likened him to a \"favorite uncle\" and publicly pronounced him \"a goofy dude.\"\nRice himself acknowledges a propensity for blurting out sentiments that more circumspect announcers would tend to internally filter. \"I don’t give a damn about a lot of things. Later on, I think back, 'Now why’d I do that?'\" he has said. This tendency to be what former broadcast partner Eddie Doucette has characterized as a \"loose cannon,\" combined with his unabashed \"homerism\", has made Rice a figure of some controversy.\nRice's outspoken demeanor resulted in one of the events for which he is best known, his 1994 ejection from an NBA game while working a radio broadcast. As Rice tells the story:\n\"At the time, Steve Javie, the official, was a young official. That previous week he had kicked out a mascot, a fan, and kicked somebody else out, a trainer or something like that. He was on a roll that week, he had made a call, and I looked on the monitor and saw it was a bad call on Cliff Robinson. I kind of put my hands like that \"[two hands waved at the official]\" and he ran over. Cliff thought he was going to call a technical on him, because Cliff was standing there doing the same thing. He ran by Cliff and that's when he kicked me out of the game — the rest is history.\"\nRice added that he subsequently wrote an article for \"Rip City\" magazine charging Javie with an abuse of power. \"I think he...read that and we have not talked since\", he noted in a 2009 interview.\nFamily and hobbies.\nRice's wife Kathy is a former Duquesne basketball player. The couple have two daughters, Susan and Stephanie, both graduates of Syracuse University, and a son, Mike Rice, Jr., who was the head basketball coach at Robert Morris University before moving to the same position at Rutgers University in May 2010. Mike Rice, Jr. was fired by Rutgers on April 3, 2013.\nDespite nine surgeries on his right knee, Mike Rice, Sr. remains an avid golfer, sporting a 6 handicap. He frequently brought his golf clubs when he traveled with the team and plays whenever possible. He also plays tennis several times a week."

        "text": "Kenneth Purvis MacKenzie (March 10, 1934 – December 14, 2023) was a Canadian relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played with the Milwaukee Braves (1960–61), New York Mets (1962–63), St. Louis Cardinals (1963), San Francisco Giants (1964), and Houston Astros (1965). \nEarly life.\nA member of Yale's Class of 1956, MacKenzie lettered in hockey and baseball at Yale University. He returned to Yale as head baseball coach in 1969 and held that post for ten seasons. The native of Gore Bay, Ontario, threw left-handed, batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and (13 stone, 3 pounds).\nCareer.\nMacKenzie signed with the Braves in 1956 and began working his way through the club's farm system, becoming a relief specialist in 1959, his third professional baseball season. After working in 14 games for Milwaukee in brief trials in 1960 and 1961, his contract was sold to the expansion Mets on October 11, 1961, one day after that year's expansion draft.\nAn original Met, MacKenzie posted a 5–4 record and was the only man among 17 pitchers on the 1962 Mets to win more games than he lost on a team which suffered 120 defeats. Manager Casey Stengel said of him: \"He's a splendid young fella with a great education from Yale University. His signing with us makes him the lowest paid member of the class of Yale '56.\" In 1963, MacKenzie again was the Mets' lone over-.500 pitcher, winning three of four decisions for a team which would lose 111 games. MacKenzie, however, was traded to the pennant-contending St. Louis Cardinals on August 5, 1963. MacKenzie recorded eight wins, five losses, and four saves, with a 4.96 earned run average over 76 games pitched for the Mets. Those eight victories would be his only Major League Baseball wins. \nMacKenzie bounced from the Cardinals to the Giants to the Astros through the 1965 campaign, spending time in Triple-A in the process.\nAll told, he won eight of 18 decisions in 129 games pitched (all but one as a reliever), with five career saves. In 208 innings pitched, he allowed 231 hits and 63 walks with 142 strikeouts.\nPost-MLB career.\nMacKenzie coached baseball and ice hockey at Yale between 1969 and 1979. He moved to the Yale alumni office following his coaching tenure, retiring in 1984.\nOn August 27, 2022, MacKenzie participated in the Mets first Old Timers' Day since 1994, in celebration of the franchise's 60th anniversary. He was one of six players from that inaugural team in attendance.\nDeath.\nMacKenzie died at his home in Guilford, Connecticut, on December 14, 2023, at the age of 89."

        "title": "Duke–Maryland men's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The Duke–Maryland men's basketball rivalry is a former college basketball rivalry between the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team of Duke University and Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team of the University of Maryland. The basketball series has been called one of the most intense intercollegiate rivalries of modern times by some. A Harris Interactive poll of Marylanders ranked it the third best in the state behind the Commanders–Cowboys and Ravens–Commanders rivalries in 2003 (before the Beltway Series of the Orioles and Nationals was possible). In 2014, Maryland left the ACC for the Big Ten and regular season games between Maryland and Duke are no longer scheduled regularly.\nHistory.\nDuke University and the University of North Carolina consider each other to be their only rivals. However, during the early 2000s the Duke–Maryland games had national implications, including in 2001 where Duke and Maryland met in the Final Four.\nThe nature of the rivalry between Duke and Maryland is not viewed in the same manner by the schools' respective fans. While the Duke–UNC rivalry originated from geographic proximity and shared history, Duke fans do not view Maryland as a rival. However, several former Duke players have cited Maryland as the team against whom they played their most exciting games. Maryland fans traditionally see the Duke game as the biggest game of the year, as is true with most of Duke's opponents. Maryland fans have often rioted in College Park after home games, regardless of the outcome. Famously, one fan threw a bottle and hit Carlos Boozer's mother in her head after Duke's remarkable comeback from a 10-point deficit in the final minute to beat Maryland, requiring the University of Maryland to issue a public apology. One year, most fans in the student section right behind the basket had to leave or turn their t-shirts inside-out because they had a FCC-banned explicative (\"F**K DUKE\") that could not be shown on television. Michael Wilbon, a sports journalist who works for ESPN, was formerly a writer for \"The Washington Post\", and owns a home in Bethesda, Maryland, refers to the Duke–Maryland rivalry as \"[o]ne of the best rivalries in one of the best basketball leagues in the country.\" In 2014, the Washington Post produced a short documentary on the peak of the rivalry from 2001 and 2002 which included interviews with Coach Williams and several former players from both teams.\nEnd of the rivalry.\nWith the University of Maryland leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference to join the Big Ten Conference at the start of the 2014–15 academic year, the schools' basketball rivalry became dormant. While Maryland competed in the ACC for the 2013–14 basketball season, the conference's expansion to a fifteen-team league means that schools do not play every league opponent twice during a given season. Duke and Maryland played one time during the 2013–14 season on February 15, 2014, at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium. To some, including Duke basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski, the emotion and spectacle that the Duke–Maryland rivalry brings to the ACC are \"not going to be there for our conference and for Duke and Maryland anymore.\""

Specifically he called the fans who jeered the team \"dim wits\", said that the same people would trade places with him in a second due to the money he was making, and that he did not appreciate being booed in his own home stadium. Henson went further by saying the fans did not understand what was best for the team because they \"work 9 to 5 at McDonald's\", which drew the most criticism. After much criticism from the media and fans, Henson apologized and has since deactivated his account. He was placed on injured reserve on September 4, 2010.\nOn August 5, 2011, he waived by the Redskins."

Kirby also reached the quarter finals of the 1994 WDC UK Matchplay, beating Cliff Lazarenko in the first round before losing to Jamie Harvey.\nKirby made two more appearances at the World Championship in 1995 and 1996 but lost out in the group stages. He also played in three World Matchplays, losing in the first round in 1994 and 1996 to Phil Taylor. Kirby won his first round match in 1995 against Sean Downs before losing in the second round to John Lowe.\nKirby then quietly disappeared from the sport but resurfaced in 2002, entering UK Open regionals. He then played in the 2003 UK Open, but lost in the preliminary round. In 2004, Kirby reached the quarter finals of the Irish Masters where he lost to Peter Manley. Kirby then returned to the UK Open the same year, reaching the third round where he lost to Colin Lloyd. He also reached the quarter finals of the Northern Ireland Open, a WDF ranked event.\nKirby qualified for the 2005 World Grand Prix in Dublin. Despite a brave effort, he lost in the first round to then-reigning champion Lloyd. Good performances in the regional finals of the 2006 UK Open earned him a spot in the third round proper but lost to Andy Callaby.\nKirby left the PDC in January 2007.\nDeath and legacy.\nKirby died in Blanchardstown from pancreatic cancer aged 61. A PDC tournament, the Irish Matchplay, was renamed the Tom Kirby Memorial Trophy in his honour. The winner of the event qualifies for the PDC World Darts Championship."

        "title": "Total Baseball",
        "text": "Total Baseball is a 2,301 page baseball encyclopedia first compiled by John Thorn and Pete Palmer in 1989. By its fourth edition, Major League Baseball endorsed it as its official encyclopedia. The encyclopedia contains seasonal and career statistics in numerous categories for every Major League Baseball player, as well as historical, opinion, and year-by-year essays. Thorn wrote one of the chapters and edited the rest while Palmer, in collaboration with Thorn, provided the statistics. \nHistory.\nThe idea for \"Total Baseball\" originated when two baseball historians and statisticians, Thorn and Palmer, realized that the current \"Baseball Encyclopedia\", at that time endorsed by Major League Baseball, contained numerous significant mistakes. These included thousands of miscalculations by earlier statisticians, typographical errors made by the original scorekeepers, and even \"phantom\" players who did not actually exist and were added to a box score incorrectly, Lou Proctor being a notable example. In addition, Thorn and Palmer corrected mistakes not commonly accepted by the baseball community, such as the discovery that Ty Cobb actually garnered 4,189 hits, not 4,191, or that Walter Johnson in fact had 417 career wins, not 414 or 416. \nThorn and Palmer also included six new sabermetric statistics for batters and fielders, and eight for pitchers. Some of these, such as runs created, were developed by statisticians like Bill James, but most were of Palmer's design. Most importantly, Thorn and Palmer normalized both conventional and new statistics for era and home park. Their most important new statistic was on-base plus slugging (OPS, today commonly seen on baseball cards and scoreboards) for all batters since 1876 for whom bases on balls were recorded. As OPS+ the statistic was normalized for season and home park, thus permitting direct comparison of the impact of players across generations, such as Babe Ruth in 1927 and Barry Bonds in 2001. \nThe first edition of the book included over 1,500 pages of statistics for all of the then 13,160 players in the history of the game. The Player Register section provided 27 batting, baserunning, and fielding statistics, broken out by year and team. The Pitcher Register included 28 pitching, batting, baserunning, and fielding statistics. The All-Time Leaders section included the top 100 all-time and single-season leaders in each of 95 categories. \nThe Roster section included the regular players, pitchers, key substitutes, and managers for all 2,010 team seasons in the history of professional baseball going back to 1871. These were grouped alphabetically by city and then by one of the six leagues: the National Association, Union Association, Players' League, Federal League, National League, and the American League. It also included a Manager Roster, a Coach Roster, and an Umpire Roster.\nThe Home-Road Statistics section illustrated the powerful effects ballparks can have on batting and pitching performance. It included the won-lost and run-scoring characteristics of every park in the three most significant major leagues – the American and National Leagues and the American Association. It also included the home/road records for all teams in all leagues since 1871. Collectively, they enabled the creation of a Park Factor, a measure of batting or pitching in one ballpark compared to the average of other parks.\nTotal Baseball also included 41 chapters in six sections about all aspects of the game.\nTotal Baseball was “packaged” by Baseball Ink, a company founded by Thorn and David Reuther. Baseball Ink provided the contents which were edited by Rick Horgan, Senior Editor at Warner Books. Baseball Ink then designed the book, had it copyedited and proofread, then delivered it to Warner ready for the printer.\nThe first edition of \"Total Baseball\" was published in 1989 by Warner Books and sold 75,000 copies. Warner published the \"Total Baseball 1990 Update\" in 1990. It also published \"Total Baseball, Second Edition\" in 1991. The latest edition, its eighth, was published in 2004."

        "text": "The 2009 PartyPoker.com Grand Slam of Darts was the third staging of the darts tournament, the Grand Slam of Darts organised by the Professional Darts Corporation. The event took place from 14 to 22 November 2009 at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, England. Television coverage of the tournament was covered by ITV Sport, with live coverage on ITV4 and highlights on ITV1.\nDespite being beaten by Vincent van der Voort in the group stages, Phil Taylor won a third consecutive Grand Slam with a 16–2 victory over Scott Waites, who became the first BDO player to reach the final of this tournament.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund increased to £400,000 for the 2009 edition of the tournament, an increase of £44,000 from the 2008 edition, £10,000 more for the runner up, £5,000 more for the semi-finalists and £2,500 more for the quarter-finalists. Players who failed to make it past the group stage in the last tournament got £4,000. However, players who finished 3rd would earn £1,000 more but players who finished bottom of a group would get £1,500 less. Also the player with the highest checkout would not be rewarded. Instead, the group winners would earn £2,500.\nQualifying.\nThere were numerous tournaments that provided qualifying opportunities to players. Most tournaments offered a qualifying position for the winner and runner-up of the tournament, however the World Championships and the Grand Slams offers a place in the tournament to all semi-finalists. There are also various other ways of qualifying for overseas players, including those from Australia and the United States, as well as a wildcard qualifying event open to any darts player. Some minor changes were made to the qualifying criteria from 2008. The winner and the runner-up of the 2009 Championship League Darts would be invited, whilst it was announced that only the winner of the 2008 World Masters would be invited (though runner-up Scott Waites was invited anyway due to the withdrawal of Martin Adams). It was also announced that the winner of the 2009 US Open would be invited, though this was later withdrawn from the qualification criteria.\nDraw.\nGroup stages.\n\"all matches first-to-5/best of 9.NB in Brackets: Number = Seeds; BDO = BDO Darts player; Q = QualifierNB: P = Played; W = Won; L = Lost; LF = Legs for; LA = Legs against; +/- = Plus/minus record, in relation to legs; Average = 3-dart average; Pts = Points\"\nGroup A.\n14 November\n15 November\n17 November\nGroup B.\n14 November\n15 November\n17 November\nGroup C.\n14 November\n15 November\n17 November\nGroup D.\n14 November\n15 November\n17 November\nGroup E.\n15 November\n16 November\n18 November\nGroup F.\n15 November\n16 November\n18 November\nGroup G.\n15 November\n16 November\n18 November\nGroup H.\n15 November\n16 November\n18 November\nNine-dart shootout.\nWith Andy Hamilton and James Wade finishing level on points and leg difference, a nine-dart shootout between the two took place, to see who would play Terry Jenkins in the second round.

        "text": "The 2008 NCAA Division I baseball season play of college baseball in the United States, organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level, began on February 22, 2008. The season was the first to have a uniform start date for both southern and northern teams. The change from previous seasons, in which weather allowed southern teams to begin play weeks before northern teams, was an attempt to improve parity between warm-weather and cold-weather teams. The season progressed through the regular season, many conference tournaments and championship series, and concluded with the 2008 NCAA Division I baseball tournament and 2008 College World Series. The College World Series, which consisted of the eight remaining teams in the NCAA tournament, was held in its annual location of Omaha, Nebraska, at Rosenblatt Stadium. It concluded on June 25, 2008, with the final game of the best of three championship series. Fresno State defeated Georgia two games to one to claim their first championship. Fresno State was the first team seeded fourth in its regional tournament to win a national championship since the NCAA tournament adopted the current 64-team format in 1999.\nRealignment.\nNew programs.\nFive new programs joined Division I baseball for the 2008 season, four from the NCAA Division II. Florida Gulf Coast, previously a Division II independent; North Carolina Central, previously of the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association; Presbyterian, previously of the Division II South Atlantic Conference; and South Carolina Upstate, previously of the Division II Peach Belt Conference, all made the transition to Division I. The fifth new program, Houston Baptist, joined Division I from the NAIA.\nConference changes.\nEntering the 2008 baseball season, the Mid-Continent Conference was renamed The Summit League. The renamed conference was one of several conferences to make membership changes.\nBoth the renamed Summit League and the Atlantic Sun Conference added multiple members. The Summit added three schools, IPFW, North Dakota State, and South Dakota State, all previously Division I independents. The Atlantic Sun added two schools, Florida Gulf Coast and South Carolina Upstate, both from Division II.\nBoth the Big West Conference, which added UC Davis from the Division I independent ranks, and the Horizon League, which added Valparaiso from the Mid-Continent, added a single member.\nThree schools joined the Division I independent ranks. Le Moyne left the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference to become an independent, and both North Carolina Central and Presbyterian became independents after their transitions from Division II.\nCollege World Series.\nThe 2008 season marked the sixty second NCAA baseball tournament, which culminated with the eight team College World Series. The College World Series was held in Omaha, Nebraska. The eight teams played a double-elimination format, with Fresno State claiming their first championship with a two games to one series win over Georgia in the final."

        "text": "The knockout phase of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League began on 24 February 2009 and concluded with the final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on 27 May 2009. The knockout phase involved the 16 teams who finished in the top two in each of their groups in the group stage.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times are in parentheses).\nFormat.\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finished level, the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed. If away goals were also equal, 30 minutes of extra time were played. If there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided via a penalty shoot-out.\nThe draw mechanism is as follows:\nIn the final, the tie was played over just one leg at a neutral venue. If scores were level at the end of normal time in the final, extra time was played, followed by penalties if scores remained tied.\nRound of 16.\nThe draw for the first knockout round of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League was held on 19 December 2008, and conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Bruno Conti, the ambassador for the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final. The first legs of the first knockout round were played on 24 and 25 February 2009, while the second legs were played on 10 and 11 March.\n \nFirst leg.\nThe knockout phase began on 24 February with four first-leg ties. English side Arsenal gained a first leg advantage with a 1–0 home victory against Roma at the Emirates Stadium, courtesy of Robin van Persie's 37th-minute penalty. The other English team in action, Manchester United, drew 0–0 with Internazionale at the San Siro, failing to score the away goal they had been hoping for. The other two matches finished in score draws, with the away sides having the upper hand going into the second legs. Lyon drew 1–1 with Barcelona at the Stade de Gerland in France, with Barcelona's Thierry Henry cancelling out an opener from Juninho. Porto came from behind twice away to Atlético Madrid to secure a 2–2 draw at the Vicente Calderón. Maxi Rodríguez put Atlético in front in the fourth minute, Lisandro López equalised in the 22nd minute, Diego Forlán scored on the stroke of half-time to restore Atlético's advantage but López levelled in the 72nd minute.\nIn the second set of first leg ties, played on 25 February 2009, three teams scored away goals. Bayern Munich scored five times without reply away to Sporting CP. In the match at the Estádio José Alvalade, Franck Ribéry gave the Germans the lead in the 42nd minute and Miroslav Klose doubled their advantage in the 57th. Ribéry scored again from the penalty spot in the 63rd before a brace from Luca Toni put the tie out of Sporting's reach, even before the second leg. Five-time winners Liverpool also managed an away win, against nine-time winners Real Madrid, but had to wait until the 82nd minute at the Santiago Bernabéu for it, when Yossi Benayoun scored a header from Fábio Aurélio's free-kick to hand them the advantage for the second leg. Villarreal and Panathinaikos shared a score draw at the El Madrigal, with Giuseppe Rossi scoring a 67th-minute penalty to cancel out Giorgos Karagounis' 59th-minute opener. In the other game, Chelsea beat Juventus at Stamford Bridge courtesy of a 12th-minute strike from Didier Drogba.\nSecond leg.\nIn the four second leg ties played on 10 March, the two English clubs in action both progressed along with Bayern Munich and Villarreal. Liverpool eliminated the nine-time European Cup winners Real Madrid with a 4–0 home victory. Fernando Torres doubled Liverpool's aggregate lead in the 16th minute, and Steven Gerrard made it 2–0 on the night with a 28th-minute penalty. Gerrard further extended Liverpool's lead two minutes after half-time and Andrea Dossena made it 5–0 on aggregate with two minutes left. Chelsea also made it through to the quarter-finals with a 2–2 draw, having won the first leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0. They fell behind to a goal from Vincenzo Iaquinta in the 19th minute but equalised through Michael Essien on the stroke of half-time. Juventus went back in front through an Alessandro Del Piero penalty, although Chelsea were heading through on the away goals ruling. Chelsea sealed their passage to the last eight when Didier Drogba equalised in the 83rd minute to win 3–2 on aggregate.\nIn the other games, Sporting CP departed the competition after setting a new Champions League record aggregate defeat of 12–1 to Bayern Munich. An early goal from Lukas Podolski extended Bayern's lead to 6–0 on aggregate and this was followed up by further strikes before half-time from Podolski again, Ânderson Polga (own goal) and Bastian Schweinsteiger, sandwiched by a consolation from Sporting's João Moutinho. Bayern were not finished at 4–1 as Mark van Bommel, Miroslav Klose and Thomas Müller further added to the scoreline. Villarreal were the fourth side to make it into the quarter-finals by beating Panathinaikos 3–2 overall. Ariel Ibagaza put Villarreal 2–1 up on aggregate in the 49th minute, Evangelos Mantzios equalised six minutes later, but Joseba Llorente turned the tie in Villarreal's favour in the 70th minute and the match finished 2–1 to Villarreal.\nThe remaining two English sides both reached the quarter-finals on 11 March and they were joined by Porto and Barcelona. Manchester United defeated Internazionale 2–0 on aggregate at Old Trafford. After a 0–0 draw at the San Siro in the first leg, United were aware that an away goal for Inter would make it difficult, but they made the perfect start with centre back Nemanja Vidić scoring with a header after four minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo doubled the lead just after half-time and the match finished 2–0. Porto and Atlético Madrid played out a 0–0 draw at the Estádio do Dragão in Portugal, but Porto went through on the away goals rule, having scored twice in a 2–2 draw in Spain. Barcelona beat Lyon 6–3 on aggregate with a 5–2 win at the Camp Nou. Thierry Henry scored twice in the space of a couple of minutes shortly before the half-hour mark to put Barcelona 3–1 up on aggregate before Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o made it 4–0 just before half-time on the night. Lyon scored two consolation goals through Jean Makoun on the stroke of half-time and Juninho just after the break, but Barcelona added a fifth in the final minute. In the last game to finish, Roma defeated Arsenal 1–0 at the Stadio Olimpico with Juan scoring in the ninth minute. The first match had finished 1–0 to Arsenal so the match headed into extra-time and, eventually, penalties. Arsenal emerged victorious in the shootout, winning 7–6 after Max Tonetto missed Roma's final spotkick.\n\"Villarreal won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Liverpool won 5–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Bayern Munich won 12–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Chelsea won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate; Porto won on away goals.\"\n\"Barcelona won 6–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"1–1 on aggregate; Arsenal won on penalties.\"\n\"Manchester United won 2–0 on aggregate.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals of the competition took place in Nyon, Switzerland, on 20 March 2009. There was no seeding and no country protection, meaning that it was an entirely random draw. The first legs were played on 7 and 8 April while the second legs were played on 14 and 15 April. Liverpool requested that their second leg be played on 14 April so that it avoid a clash with the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April.\nFirst leg.\nEnglish sides Manchester United and Arsenal were involved in the first two quarter-final matches on 7 April. Arsenal were playing the first leg away against Villarreal from Spain, their second encounter in three years following on from a meeting in the semi-finals three years earlier. Villarreal went in front in the 10th minute thanks to a long-range effort from Marcos Senna. The \"Yellow Submarine\" went on to dominate the first half, but Arsenal did not concede again and their defensive work was rewarded in the 66th minute as a clipped ball from Arsenal captain Cesc Fàbregas was controlled on the chest by Emmanuel Adebayor and volleyed acrobatically with an overhead kick into the bottom corner. The match eventually finished 1–1, with Arsenal taking an away goal into the second leg.\nManchester United played their first leg at home at Old Trafford against Porto, the team who had knocked them out in the first knockout round five years before. Porto took an early lead, in the fourth minute, when Cristian Rodríguez netted past Edwin van der Sar. The advantage lasted only 11 minutes, however, at which point Wayne Rooney scored the equaliser, chipping the ball over the advancing Helton following a careless back-pass from Bruno Alves. In an open game, in which Porto dominated, another goal appeared certain but did not come until the 85th minute. Carlos Tevez saw off his marker to score from a Rooney flick from a couple of yards out. The action had not finished however and Mariano González equalised in the final minute to hand Porto a second away goal.\nLiverpool and Chelsea faced each other in an all-English tie at Anfield on 8 April. The sides were meeting in the Champions League for the fifth straight season, having last faced each other in the competition in the 2008 semi-final, when Chelsea advanced to the final. Fernando Torres handed an early advantage to Liverpool, scoring in the sixth minute. However, their lead only lasted until the 39th minute when the Liverpool defence allowed Branislav Ivanović too much space at a corner and he was able to power a header past Pepe Reina. Chelsea took the lead in the 62nd minute from an almost identical situation as Ivanović scored his second headed goal. Didier Drogba added a final goal to make it 3–1 to the away side with a side-footed finish.\nIn the final game, played on the same evening, two of the most successful European clubs, Barcelona and Bayern Munich met at the Camp Nou in Spain. It was their first meeting since the group stage of the 1998–99 tournament. Bayern had beaten Sporting CP 12–1 in the previous round, but Barcelona posed a far tougher proposition and it showed. Lionel Messi put Barcelona in front in the ninth minute and Samuel Eto'o doubled the lead three minutes later. Messi scored his second goal in the 38th minute and Thierry Henry made it 4–0 in the 43rd minute. The score remained at 4–0 throughout the second half, leaving Barcelona as favourites to progress.\nSecond leg.\nIn the first two of four second-leg ties, Chelsea came with a 3–1 advantage over Liverpool and the bonus of three away goals, Liverpool came into their match knowing they needed to score three times without conceding to progress, or win 3–1 to take the game to extra time at Stamford Bridge. Despite starting the match as outsiders, Liverpool looked to be well on the way towards their target as they took a 2–0 lead within half an hour and levelled the scores at 3–3 on aggregate. Fábio Aurélio scored directly with a free kick from the left of the penalty area in the 19th minute to hand them the lead and this was doubled nine minutes later from the penalty spot: Xabi Alonso stepped up to score following a foul on him by Branislav Ivanović. But six minutes after half-time, Didier Drogba made the score 2–1 with a shot that went through the hands of Pepe Reina, and six minutes later, Chelsea equalised to 2–2 when Alex scored with a powerful free kick. Frank Lampard put Chelsea 3–2 up in the 76th minute and, at this stage, Liverpool needed to score three goals to advance. Goals from Lucas and Dirk Kuyt in the 81st and 83rd minutes, respectively, put Liverpool 4–3 up on the night and only a goal away from advancing. However, Lampard scored again in the 89th minute to finish the tie off, and the match ended 4–4 and 7–5 to Chelsea overall.\nIn the other match to take place that evening, Barcelona and Bayern Munich played out a 1–1 draw at the Allianz Arena. Bayern trailed the tie 4–0 following the first match at the Camp Nou and they were able to play without fear in the first half. Luca Toni and Franck Ribéry created chances in the first half but Barcelona weathered the storm and created their only meaningful chance of the first half through Dani Alves. They managed to pull a goal back early in the second half, when Zé Roberto took the ball past defender Yaya Touré and set up Ribéry who was able to score past Víctor Valdés. But Barcelona put the tie beyond the reach of Bayern with an equaliser from Seydou Keita at the end of a 17-pass move. The match finished 1–1, giving Barcelona a 5–1 aggregate win to set up a fourth tie with Chelsea in five seasons two weeks later.\nThe third second-leg tie was finely poised at 1–1 between Arsenal and Villarreal at the Emirates Stadium, with Arsenal ahead courtesy of the away goals rule; Villarreal came into the match knowing they had to score. Both teams were without key players: Arsenal had to play without goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, William Gallas and Gaël Clichy while captain Marcos Senna and Santi Cazorla were missing for Villarreal. Theo Walcott delivered some dangerous crosses and Robin van Persie missed an early chance from Samir Nasri's cross, but Diego Godín also tested Arsenal goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański with a volley. Arsenal, however, took the lead in the 10th minute as Walcott raced onto a Fàbregas through-ball and chipped the ball over Diego López. Villarreal continued to create chances, including Robert Pires nearly marking his return to his former club with a goal. Emmanuel Adebayor followed up a Van Persie free kick with a header on goal, but Gonzalo Rodríguez cleared the ball off the line. After half-time, Van Persie had a shot from distance charged down, but Arsenal did score a second goal in the 60th minute as Van Persie opted to slide a pass through to Adebayor, and his strike partner applied the finish. The tie was over in the 69th minute when Godín was adjudged to have fouled Walcott; Sebastián Eguren collected a second yellow card for his protests before Van Persie scored from the penalty spot. The match finished 3–0 to Arsenal, with Arsenal winning 4–1 on aggregate.\nThe final quarter-final second leg tie was between Porto and Manchester United, played simultaneously with Arsenal's match. Porto had the advantage of two away goals, after drawing 2–2 at Old Trafford. Manchester United looked to recall Rio Ferdinand from a back injury to partner Nemanja Vidić in central defence. Despite a mixed season, Cristiano Ronaldo had still scored 20 goals in all competitions and won numerous awards and he added his 21st goal with a 35-metre strike after only six minutes. Porto created very few chances, their only meaningful shot being a free kick that went wide of Edwin van der Sar's goal in the first half and later a chance for Lisandro López. United played the game at a controlled pace, but they were unable to score a second goal to settle the nerves – the threat remained that if Porto scored late, United would be knocked out. Ronaldo had a shot saved by the Porto goalkeeper Helton and Vidić missed from a couple of yards. They held on to become the first English team to win at Porto and keep their ambition of winning five trophies in the same season alive. It was United's first clean sheet in six matches and set up a semi-final with fellow English team Arsenal.\n\"Chelsea won 7–5 on aggregate.\"\n\"Barcelona won 5–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Arsenal won 4–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Manchester United won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals took place immediately after the draw for the quarter-finals. The first legs were played on 28 and 29 April and the second legs on 5 and 6 May.\nSecond leg.\nAlthough Chelsea were at home and had managed to hold Barcelona to a goalless draw at the Camp Nou in the first leg, Barcelona went into the second leg as favourites. The game started well for Chelsea and in the ninth minute Michael Essien scored a 20-yard left-footed volley after Barcelona had failed to clear a pass into the box from Frank Lampard. The first half came to a close with Chelsea leading 1–0. Despite Barcelona's domination of possession, Chelsea were the more dangerous side, especially after Eric Abidal was sent off for a foul on Nicolas Anelka. A 93rd-minute equaliser by Andrés Iniesta – which happened to be Barcelona's only shot on target in the match – saw his side reach the final.\nAlmost as soon as referee Tom Henning Øvrebø blew the final whistle, several Chelsea players surrounded him with complaints regarding his decisions. Some players, like Frank Lampard and Iniesta, swapped shirts, while others, such as Michael Ballack, John Terry, and Didier Drogba, continued to shout at the referee and contest him, with Drogba notably shouting, \"It's a fucking disgrace\" into a live television camera. Kevin McCarra writing for \"The Guardian\" described Øvrebø as \"relatively inexperienced\" and declared he \"did not inspire any confidence whatsoever\".\nIn the post-game analysis on Sky Sports 2, the four commentators unanimously held that of the four possible penalty appeals turned down by the referee, three of them should have been awarded, including the shirt-pulling against Didier Drogba by Eric Abidal which would have otherwise been a one-on-one against the goalkeeper, the lob over Barcelona defender Gerard Piqué that was blocked by his outstretched right hand in the 82nd minute, and the last-minute upper arm block by Eto'o. All three fouls were committed inside the penalty box. Referee Øvrebø admitted his errors in 2018 at an interview after the two teams played against each other in the 2017–18 Champions League round of 16.\n\"Manchester United won 4–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"1–1 on aggregate; Barcelona won on away goals.\""

        "title": "Golf in Scotland",
        "text": "Golf in Scotland was first recorded in the Scottish late Middle Ages, and the modern game of golf was first developed and established in the country. The game plays a key role in the national sporting consciousness.\nThe Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, known as the R&amp;A, was the world governing body for the game (except in the United States and Mexico). The R&amp;A, a separate organisation from the club, was created in 2004 as the governing body. The Scottish Ladies' Golfing Association was founded in 1904 and the Scottish Golf Union (SGU) in 1920. They merged in 2015 into a new organization, Scottish Golf.\nTo many golfers, the Old Course at St Andrews, an ancient links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage. There are many other famous golf courses in Scotland, including Carnoustie, Gleneagles, Muirfield, Kingsbarns, Turnberry and Royal Troon. The world's first Open Championship was held at Prestwick in 1860, and Scots golfers have the most victories at the Open at 42 wins, one ahead of the United States.\nAlthough golf is often seen as an elitist sport elsewhere in the world, in the land of its birth it enjoys widespread appeal across the social spectrum, in line with the country's egalitarian tradition. For example, the Old Course at St Andrews is a charitable trust and Musselburgh Links are public courses. Council-owned courses, with low fees and easy access, are common throughout the country wherever demography and geography allow. Therefore, golf courses, whether public or private, are far more common in the Lowlands than in the Highlands and Islands, where shinty (a game which may share a common ancestry with golf) is often the traditional sport.\nScotland is widely promoted as the \"Home of Golf,\" and along with whisky and the long list of Scottish inventions and discoveries, golf is widely seen as being a key national cultural icon throughout the world. It is frequently used to market the country to potential visitors, for example for the Homecoming year in 2009, and golf tourism accounted for approximately 2% of overall Scottish tourism spending in 2004. One page that explains the history of golf in Scotland starts off by stating that, \"There has been much debate as to the origins of the game and, in some cases, how it was originally played. One thing is certain — the game of golf as we know it was born in Scotland\".\nScotland has 587 courses, the most courses per head of any country, with the majority being in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"golf\" was first recorded in the 15th century, appearing twice in an act of the Scots Parliament of 6 March 1457, in the reign of James II. The act, which ordered the holding of \"wappenschaws\" () four times a year for the purpose of archery practice, stated that \"the fut bal ande the golf\" (football and golf) were to be \"vtterly criyt done\" (\"condemned\"; lit. \"cried down\") and \"nocht vsyt\" (\"not engaged in\"; lit. \"not used\"). Offenders were to be punished by the barony courts, otherwise they were \"to be tane be the kingis officiaris\" (\"arrested by the king's officers\").\nFootball (see Football in Scotland) and golf are again both explicitly named and forbidden in two further 15th century Scottish statutes encouraging archery practice, in 1470 and 1491. The 1470 Act, in the reign of James III, again uses the spelling \"golf\", but the 1491 Act, in the reign of James IV, spells it ; and variants such as , , became the usual spellings during the Early Modern Period. The Scottish National Dictionary states that \"\"golf\" represents a revival of the Middle Scots form; Loudoun Gowf Club, Newmilns, retains the old form in its title\"; i.e. the spelling changed from Medieval \"golf\" to Early Modern \"gowf\", and then back again.\nThe Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue gives the etymology of the word \"golf\" or (with many alternative spellings) as probably from the Dutch \"kolf\" (see Kolven, a Dutch indoor ballgame); although the dictionary also records the noun \"golf\" (with alternative spellings \"golfe\" or \"golph\") as deriving from Middle English \"golf\" or or Old French , meaning \"a deep pool or hollow; an abyss\"; a cognate of modern English \"gulf\".\nOrigins.\nThe exact origins of the sport of golf are unclear. The most widely accepted theory is that the modern game of golf originated in Scotland in the High Middle Ages. The first golf courses and clubs were established in the country. The first written rules originated in Scotland, as did the establishment of the 18-hole course. The first tournament structures developed and competitions were held between various burghs. The modern game was spread by Scots to the rest of the world.\nThe earliest reference to golf is the purchase of a set of golf clubs by James IV from a bowmaker of St Johnston (Perth) in 1502. Where he played is not known, but it is likely to have been on the open ground called the North Inch at Perth. It is recorded that Robert Maule of Panmure played golf at Carnoustie in the mid 16th century, as a wager for drink. Around the same time, in 1552, John Hamilton the Archbishop of St Andrews granted the right of the people of St Andrews to play golf and gather turf on the links, retaining his rights to the rabbit warrens there.\nThe Old Links at Musselburgh Racecourse is claimed to be the oldest playing golf course in the world. Evidence has shown that golf was played on Musselburgh Links in 1672, although Mary, Queen of Scots reputedly played there even earlier in 1567.\nAn entry in the Edinburgh burgh records for 19 April 1592 includes golf in a list of pastimes to be avoided on the Sabbath. The parish register for neighbouring South Leith records the appearance of four parishioners before the kirk session on 7 December 1610 who \"confessed they had prophaned the Sabbath be playing at the gowffe in tyme off preaching and thairfore was ordained to mak thair publict repentance the nixt Sabboth.\"\nGolf course evolution.\nGolf courses have not always consisted of eighteen holes. The St Andrews Links occupy a narrow strip of land along the sea-shore. As early as the 15th century, golfers at St Andrews established a trench through the undulating terrain, playing to holes whose locations were dictated by topography. The course that emerged featured eleven holes, laid out end to end from the clubhouse to the far end of the property. One played the holes out, turned around, and played the holes in, for a total of 22 holes. In 1764, several of the holes were deemed too short and therefore combined. The number was thereby reduced from 11 to nine so that a complete round of the links comprised 18 holes. Due to the status of St Andrews as the 'home of golf', other courses followed suit and the 18-hole course became the standard which has remained to the present day.\nThere are now more than 550 golf courses throughout the country, with at least 21 courses in Edinburgh alone.\nSpreading the game outside Scotland.\nWhen James VI succeeded to the thrones of England and Ireland in 1603 (see Union of the Crowns) a large number of his Scottish courtiers followed him to London. The King resided at Greenwich Palace, and there is documentary evidence that some of these Scottish noblemen played golf on Blackheath, on the hill behind the palace. Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the king's eldest son, was playing golf in 1606. The Royal Blackheath Golf Club traces its origins from these Scottish noblemen, thus claiming a pre-1745 foundation date. Although it is certainly the oldest English golf club and the oldest outside Scotland, there is no evidence that it is the oldest golf club in the world, as is sometimes claimed. This accolade is claimed by The Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh who date back to 1735.\nThe first record of North American golf was a consignment of 96 golf clubs and 432 golf balls which was shipped from Leith to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1743; and on 29 September 1786 Scottish merchants established the South Carolina Golf Club in Charleston, the first golf club in the United States.\nPlayers.\nSeveral Scots golfers are members of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Players marked * are also members of the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame:\nBelle Robertson (born 1936) and Jessie Valentine (1915–2006) are all inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame, but not the World Golf Hall of Fame."

The game featured the Alabama Crimson Tide, of the Southern Conference, and Stanford, of the Pacific Coast Conference, now the Pac-12 Conference. It was Stanford's second Rose Bowl game in three years. The game ended in a 7–7 tie, the last Rose Bowl game to end in a tie.\nGame summary.\nUnited Press called the 1927 Rose Bowl \"the football championship of America\", and the game was considered the most exciting in the series up to that time. The crowd of 57,417 set an attendance record. Stanford's George Bogue missed an 18-yard field goal attempt in the first quarter, then threw a touchdown pass to Ed Walker and kicked the point after to put Stanford up, 7-0. Stanford held that lead through most of the rest of the game, but in the final minutes, they were forced to punt on fourth down. Frankie Wilton's kick was blocked, and Alabama took over 14 yards from goal. Alabama running back Jimmy Johnson carried the ball in for the touchdown. The two-point conversion, and overtime, were decades in the future. Stanford's only hope was to block the point after, but Alabama ran the play quickly and Herschel Caldwell's kick tied Stanford, and took away a Stanford victory in the final minute."

        "title": "John Henderson (darts player)",
        "text": "John Henderson (born 4 May 1973) is a Scottish darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events.\nCareer.\nHenderson started out in the PDC circuit and played one tournament in Scotland as well as the 2003 UK Open where he lost in the first round, having won his preliminary match. He then qualified for the 2005 BDO World Darts Championship, where he beat Stephen Bunting in the first round before losing in round two to Martin Adams – hitting a record thirteen 180s (for a five-set match) in the 3–2 defeat. Henderson then reached the quarter-finals of the 2005 British Open and the last 32 of the 2005 Winmau World Masters.\nHenderson reached the final of the 2007 British Open. He beat Tony O'Shea in the quarter-finals and Ted Hankey in the semis before losing to Gary Anderson in the final. This was followed however with failure to qualify for the 2008 BDO World Championship and an early exit from the 2007 World Masters.\n2008–2009.\n2008 was a good year for Henderson, reaching the semi-finals of the Norway Open and the quarter-finals of the WDF Europe Cup. On 20 September 2008 Henderson captured his very first title, winning the 2008 British Open. He scored notable wins over Edwin Max and Dave Chisnall to earn a spot into the televised stages which were shown live on Setanta Sports. He then defeated Gary Robson in the quarter-finals and Mareno Michels in the semis before avenging his defeat over Anderson twelve months previously by beating him in the final to win the £3,000 top prize. The win also helped Henderson finish fourth in the BDO International Grand Prix, earning him another £2,750 for his efforts. He also shot up the world rankings as a result of the win, moving him into the WDF's top 20. He then captured the German Open in 2009, beating Stephen Bunting in the final which elevated Henderson to seven in the WDF rankings.\n2010–2011.\nHenderson then qualified for the 2010 BDO World Championship, winning one of four places available from the Inter-Playoff Qualifiers in Bridlington. He was defeated in the second round by Scott Waites. Henderson failed to qualify for the 2011 tournament, but did qualify for the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts where he finished third in his group. After being defeated by Mervyn King he was accused of standing in front of the oche, however after watching the match again, King admitted that he had over-reacted and apologised to Henderson in a pre-match interview.\nOn 15 January 2011, Henderson came through qualifying at the PDC Q-School event and has therefore left the British Darts Organisation. On joining the PDC he said \"It means everything to me the first two days were hard and I felt a lot of pressure today but to qualify, so I'm delighted I did it.\"\nIn the 2011 Derby championships, Henderson hit a nine-darter in his second leg of the second round beating Andy Hamilton 6–5 and earning £800.\nHenderson qualified for the 2011 World Matchplay where he beat Colin Lloyd 10–7 in the first round, before losing to Andy Hamilton 13–11 in the second round. He defeated on form Justin Pipe 2–0 at the World Grand Prix 2011, he went on to reach the quarter finals losing to eventual runner up Brendan Dolan\n2012 - 2020.\nHenderson reached his first PDC World Championship in 2012, but was beaten by three-time World Champion, John Part, 0–3. He only managed to win 2 legs during the match, with Part stating afterwards that \"John struggled and wasn't himself\". His best result on the 2012 Pro Tour was in reaching the quarter-finals of the 16th Players Championship event, where he lost to Nick Fullwell 2–6. Henderson was beaten in the last 16 of the Qualifier for the 2013 World Championship. He was ranked world number 39 after the World Championship.\nHenderson qualified for the 2013 UK Open by finishing 50th on the Order of Merit to enter the event in the second round. He enjoyed his best ever run in the tournament by beating Dave Place, Scott Rand and Kevin McDine to advance to the last 16. He played James Wade and lost 9–4. Henderson reached the quarter-finals of a Players Championship played in Killarney for the second consecutive year as he beat Mark Webster, Ian White and Justin Pipe before being whitewashed 6–0 by Darren Webster. He qualified for the 2014 World Championship through the ProTour Order of Merit having claimed the ninth of sixteen places that were available to non-qualified players. Henderson started his first round match brightly as he took a 2–0 lead against seventh seed Dave Chisnall which included a 132 finish of bull, bull, double 16. He threw for the match in the third set but lost the leg and the set as Chisnall fought back to level the game. Henderson survived four match darts from Chisnall in the final set as he pulled off a big shock win in a performance he rated as the best of his career. Another tight match followed against Mark Webster with Henderson missing three darts at tops to seal a 4–2 win, and then went on to lose the deciding set to bow out of the tournament 4–3.\nAt the 2014 UK Open, Henderson was beaten 5–1 by Jelle Klaasen in the second round. He beat Steve Hine 6–4, Peter Wright 6–5 and Simon Whitlock 6–2 (with an average of 106.12) to reach the quarter-finals of the German Darts Masters, where he lost 6–2 against Adrian Lewis. In the rest of the year he lost in the last 16 of two Players Championships and qualified for three European Tour events, losing in the second round in two and the opening round of the other.\nThe opening four sets in Henderson's first round 2015 World Championship match against Vincent van der Voort went with throw to send it into a deciding set. Van der Voort hit a crucial 157 finish with Henderson waiting on 80 for the match and from there the Dutchman won back-to-back 14 dart legs to knock him out. A pair of last 16 finishes helped Henderson enter the UK Open at the third round stage and he eliminated Steve Douglas 9–7 and then retained his composure when Daryl Gurney won five legs in a row to lead 8–7 by beating him 9–8. This matched Henderson's best ever run the event, but it came to a sudden end when he lost 9–2 against Peter Wright. At the German Darts Masters, Henderson defeated Michael Smith 6–4 and then averaged 102.48 in a 6–0 whitewash over Andrew Gilding. He improved upon that in the quarter-finals by averaging 107.72 during a 6–1 victory against Brendan Dolan and knocked out Adrian Lewis 6–4 to reach his first PDC final. Henderson played world number one Michael van Gerwen and he sent the match into a final leg decider, after being 3–0 down, which he lost without getting a dart for the title. He suffered first round exits at the World Matchplay (10–2 to Phil Taylor) and the World Grand Prix (2–0 in sets to Gary Anderson), but then defeated Robert Thornton 6–4 at the European Championship. Henderson then took advantage of a poor performance from Rowby-John Rodriguez in the second round to thrash him 10–2 and reach his first major quarter-final in over four years, where he lost 10–4 to Peter Wright.\nAfter taking the opening set in his first round match at the 2016 World Championship, Henderson went on to lose 3–1 against Darren Webster. One semi-final and a quarter-final appearance in the qualifiers helped him finish 17th on the Order of Merit for the UK Open. Henderson saw off Magnus Caris 9–4, before losing 9–6 to Adrian Lewis in the fourth round. His second semi-final of the year was at the 14th Players Championship event and he was knocked out 6–4 by Michael van Gerwen. He was ousted 6–3 by Gary Anderson in the first round of the Players Championship Finals.\nHe won the opening two sets against Andrew Gilding in the first round of the 2017 World Championship, before it was levelled at 2–2. Henderson missed one match dart in the deciding set and it would eventually go to a sudden-death leg. Gilding won the bull to throw first and took the leg to eliminate Henderson.\nFollowing Gary Anderson's withdrawal from the 2019 Premier League, Henderson was selected as one of nine 'contenders' to replace him. A great boost for his Red Army following of his fellow Aberdeen FC fans. He played a one-off match against No. 1 PDC-ranked Michael van Gerwen on night five in Aberdeen. The match resulted in a draw.\nHenderson returned to the Premier League in 2020 under the new tag of 'Challenger', once again in Aberdeen. However, he was beaten by Nathan Aspinall.\n2021.\nHenderson, alongside Peter Wright, won the 2021 PDC World Cup of Darts playing on behalf of Scotland. It was his first PDC Major Tournament win.\n2022.\nHenderson failed to qualify for 2022 PDC World Darts Championship, missing this event for the first time since 2013. He continued to struggle on Pro Tour, but was again nominated for 2022 PDC World Cup of Darts, where he was defending the title alongside Peter Wright. Together they made it to the Quarterfinals, where they lost against England. At the end of the season he dropped out of top 64 of PDC Order of Merit, failing to qualify for the World Championship second time in the row and lost his Tour Card after the season 2022.\n2023.\nHe was not able to retain his Tour card in UK Q-School and played on PDC Challenge Tour. He secured two titles during the year and was battling for the second place in PDC Challenge Tour Order of Merit. After losing in an early round of the last PDC Challenge Tour event, Henderson had to hope that Andy Boulton, Cam Crabtree and Owen Bates would not make the final. Boulton and Crabtree dropped out at the last sixteen. Despite facing multiple match darts against Michael Warburton, Bates made it to the final and clinched the second place, therefore Henderson did not get his Tour card via PDC Challenge Tour for just £175, placing 3rd overall in the rankings. \n2024.\nUnable to win his Tour card back in UK Q-School, Henderson continued playing PDC Challenge Tour in 2024. He also accepted the invitation for 2024 World Seniors Darts Championship. He has become the World Seniors Darts champion at the first time of asking, competing in the event for the first time, defeated Colin McGarry 5-0 in the final. \nPersonal life.\nHenderson is married to Veronica Hughes and has no children .\nPerformance timeline.\nPDC European Tour"

He also managed in the minor leagues from 1998 to 2001. His brother is former NHL goalie Jim Carey.\nEarly life.\nCarey was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He attended Boston College High School in Dorchester, Massachusetts and then Stanford University, where he was voted the 1987 College World Series Most Outstanding Player as a freshman outfielder on Stanford's national champion baseball team on the basis of going 3-for-5 with two RBI and scoring two runs in the title game in Omaha. Even before the final game against Oklahoma State, Carey had made a case for MOP when he smashed a walk-off opposite-field grand slam over the left-field fence in the 10th inning to give the Cardinal a 6-5 win over LSU. Carey is one of three players from Stanford University to win the MOP award (Lee Plemel and John Hudgins are the other two). He was inducted into the Stanford University Hall of Fame in 1990. In 1987, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nPlaying career.\nHe was selected in the 27th round of the 1986 draft by the Seattle Mariners but chose not to sign, and then by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1989 draft, but again didn't sign. After being chosen by the Miami Miracle of the Florida State League in the fourth round of the 1990 draft, however, he did sign. 1990 was his first professional season; he hit .327 for Miami with four home runs and 20 RBI in 153 at-bats.\nOn March 18, 1991, the Baltimore Orioles purchased his contract from the Miracle. He played for the Hagerstown Suns in 1991, hitting .252 with 12 home runs and 65 RBI. In 1992, his hitting improved as he played for the Frederick Keys, Hagerstown Suns and Rochester Red Wings at different times. In 136 at-bats with the Keys, he hit .301 with nine home runs and 26 RBI. In 163 at-bats with the Suns, he hit .270 with four home runs and 18 RBI. In 87 at-bats with the Red Wings, however, he fell to .230 with one home run and seven RBI. Overall for 1992, he hit .272 with 14 home runs and 51 RBI.\nHe spent most of 1993 with the Red Wings, hitting .311 with 12 home runs and 50 RBI in 325 at-bats. On May 25, 1993 he made his major league debut against Bob Wickman and the New York Yankees. As the Orioles' DH, he went 1 for 3 in a losing effort. The Yankees won the game 1–0. He played in 18 games that season, collecting 10 hits in 47 at-bats for a .213 batting average. He played his final major league game on October 2, 1993.\nAlthough his major league career was over, he played professionally until 1995. In 1994, he played for Frederick and Rochester, hitting a combined .279 with 14 home runs and 40 RBI in 226 at-bats. In 1995, he hit .236 with nine home runs and 50 RBI for the Red Wings.\nOverall, he hit .275 with 65 home runs and 276 RBI in his six-year minor league career.\nManaging career.\nCarey managed in the minor leagues from 1998 to 2001. The following is his managerial record."

Hedges was instrumental in bringing Branch Rickey into the Browns' front office. He sold the Browns to Phil Ball after the 1915 season.\nNicknamed as \"Colonel Bob,\" Hedges is considered to be the first major league owner to view baseball as a purely business venture. Consequently, he invested in innovations that he believed would improve his bottom line by increasing fan attendance (such as through the installation of an electronic scoreboard and the hiring of the first live announcer) or by protecting his assets (such as by taking out life insurance policies on players and developing the first canvas to protect the playing surface from rain).\nActions by Hedges were key to brokering peace between the National League and its rivals. After a bidding war with the American League led to salary inflation, he symbolically returned future Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson to the New York Giants as part of the settlement to prevent future roster raids. Hedges sold the team to Federal League owner Phil Ball to prevent cannibalization of the St. Louis baseball market, as the presence of three professional teams in the city and the corresponding stiff competition for players caused each franchise to experience financial losses.\nHedges who, grew up on a farm and began his career working as a clerk for Jackson County, became wealthy through the manufacture of carriages. In 1900, with profits soaring, he sold his business as he had correctly surmised that his industry was greatly threatened by the rise of the automobile."

He died in St. Louis, Missouri of sepsis. Ball became wealthy through the ownership of the Federal Cold Storage Company refrigeration company in St. Louis; he expanded his holdings to include oil wells, ranch lands, and urban commercial real estate. He was considered the Federal League owner most committed to the development of a permanent third major league.\nAs the Federal League's bidding war with the established clubs took a financial toll on its owners, Ball remained committed to stocking a competitive roster. His strategy undermined the bottom line of the Terriers, Browns, and St. Louis Cardinals. As part of a final settlement, Robert Hedges sold the Browns to Ball, who was subsequently able to transfer a number of players from his folded club to his new franchise.\nLegacy.\nBall is perhaps best known for demoting pioneering baseball executive Branch Rickey from general manager to business manager in 1915, which led to his departure for the Cardinals. He considered Rickey's ideas, such as the development of an integrated farm system, to be too radical for the time; however, he also sought to prevent other teams from experimenting with these ideas by unsuccessfully seeking a court order to vacate Rickey's 1917 contract with the Browns' crosstown rivals.\nAmid the poor fortunes of the team both financially and on the field, Ball's estate continued to own the Browns after his death until , when the team was sold to Donald Lee Barnes."

It featured the Illinois Fighting Illini and the Washington Huskies.\nIllinois was led by co-captains Dick Butkus and George Donnelly, Jim Grabowski, Lynn Stewart, and Archie Sutton on their way to a victory over the Huskies, led by Junior Coffey.\nThe game was scoreless until the second quarter; Washington scored first, following an Illinois fumble at its own 27-yard line. Backup quarterback, Bill Siler, kept it for three yards, then passed it to Joe Mancuso for 18 yards to the Illini 6. Siler then faked a pass and pitched to halfback Dave Kopay, who scored behind the block of halfback Ron Medved, with 8:26 left in the first half. The Illini got on the scoreboard with Jim Plankenhorn's field goal in the waning seconds of the second quarter and Washington led \nIn the third quarter, after George Donnelly's first interception of the game, Illinois took control as Jim Warren scored a touchdown for the Illini on a two-yard run.\nIn the fourth quarter, with Illinois up by a score of 10-7, Washington was driving downfield, trying to score a go-ahead and possible game-winning touchdown, but George Donnelly intercepted the ball on the 4-yard line and ran it back to the 15. Illinois capitalized on that momentum and moved the ball 85 yards, with Jim Grabowski scoring his second touchdown of the game to put Illinois ahead 17-7.\nSophomore Grabowski rushed for 125 yards and was named the game's Most Valuable Player. Butkus played both ways in this contest, both at center and linebacker. He recovered a fumble, and had an interception (in addition to leading a defense that held Washington to only 59 yards rushing and 71 yards passing for the game).\nAftermath.\nThe opposing running backs were both drafted by the Green Bay Packers, Coffey in 1965 and Grabowski in 1966."

        "text": "Spencer Paul Heath (November 5, 1893 – January 25, 1930) was an American relief pitcher who played in four games for the Chicago White Sox during the 1920 season. Listed at and , Heath was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed.\nHeath was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he lived much of his life. After one season of Minor League Baseball with the Winnipeg Maroons in 1919, he joined the White Sox in 1920. Though he was part of their Opening Day roster in April and stayed with the team through July, he only appeared in four games before the team released him. Afterwards, he played semipro baseball and worked for the Chicago Police Department before dying of double lobar pneumonia and influenza in 1930.\nEarly life.\nSpencer Paul Heath was born on November 5, 1893, in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were Spencer and Agatha. Well-known around Chicago for his skills in semipro baseball, Heath played for Garden City, the Gunthers, and the Ciceros of the Chicago City League.\nDuring World War I, Heath served his country at the Great Lakes Naval Base, working as an electrician. He also played on the base's baseball team. Heath was discharged following the war.\nWinnipeg Maroons (1919).\nHeath played one season of Minor league baseball for the Winnipeg Maroons of the Class C Western Canada League in 1919. A pitcher, he appeared in 28 games, leading the circuit in wins as he posted an 18–8 record, good for a .692 winning percentage. That August, he was signed by the Chicago White Sox of the American League (AL), though he was not a part of their roster as they won the AL pennant and lost the World Series.\nChicago White Sox (1920).\nAt spring training for the first time with the White Sox in 1920, Heath pitched well enough to be named to the team's Opening Day roster. Baseball historian Frank Russo noted that this was difficult, considering that most of the pitchers on the pennant-winning team from the year before were returning. At 26, Heath was on a Major League Baseball (MLB) roster for the first time.\nHeath made his major league debut on May 4, 1920, relieving Dickie Kerr with the bases loaded and Chicago trailing the St. Louis Browns 5–3 in the third inning. He induced Jimmy Austin to hit into a ground out, ending the inning. However, Heath went on to allow seven runs in three innings of work, including a home run to future Hall of Famer George Sisler. The Browns won 12–4 in a game that Russo described as a \"debacle\" for the White Sox.\nThe next two appearances for Heath came on back to back days, May 28 and 29, in a series against the Cleveland Indians. Called on to relieve Kerr again on May 28, Heath pitched the seventh and eighth innings. He was the last pitcher used by Chicago because there was no need for the Indians to bat in the ninth, as they were leading 13–6 following Chicago's final opportunity to score. Heath allowed just one run, and it was unearned, though the error was his own.\nHeath's appearance on May 29 was the first game of a doubleheader. After White Sox starter Lefty Williams was pinch-hit for in the top of the fourth inning, Heath came on to pitch the bottom of it with his team down 6–1. Doubles by future Hall of Famer Tris Speaker and Larry Gardner led to a run, and another error by Heath ruined a pickoff attempt of Gardner at second base. Heath was replaced by George Payne to start the fourth. The White Sox continued to trail most of the game but scored five runs in the ninth to defeat Cleveland 8–7.\nNearly two months went by before Heath made another appearance on July 17. The White Sox were down 8–2 to the New York Yankees when Heath relieved Eddie Cicotte to start the sixth inning. He allowed three runs and had only recorded one out until Ping Bodie flew out to right field, and future Hall of Famer Babe Ruth was thrown out on his way back to first base to complete an inning-ending double play. Aaron Ward and Muddy Ruel each had hits against him to start the seventh inning, bringing up New York pitcher Carl Mays, who attempted to sacrifice bunt. Heath made another error allowing Mays to reach safely, though, and he was replaced by Payne after giving up a double to Roger Peckinpaugh. Ultimately, Heath would be charged with allowing seven runs (six earned) in one inning as the Yankees won 20–5.\nThe July 17 contest would be the last of Heath's MLB career, as he was released by the team shortly thereafter. In four relief appearances, Heath posted a 15.43 earned run average (ERA) in 7.0 innings of work, giving up 12 runs on 19 hits and two walks without recording a strikeout or a decision.\nLater years.\nHeath returned to playing semipro ball after his time with the White Sox. Then, he was hired by the Chicago Police Department. In 1930, an ill Heath was admitted to Edgewater Hospital in Chicago. On January 25, he died of double lobar pneumonia and influenza, which had been made worse by a cerebral hemorrhage. Unmarried at the time of his death, he was buried adjacent to his father at Chicago's St. Boniface Cemetery on January 29."

        "text": "The 2008 Rugby League World Cup final was the championship-deciding game of the 2008 Rugby League World Cup tournament. Played between New Zealand and Australia on 22 November 2008 at Brisbane's Lang Park, the match was a re-play of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup final and its outcome determined who became World Cup-holders for the following five years. Considered one of the biggest upsets in rugby league, New Zealand defeated Australia 34–20 to claim their first ever World Cup title. \nBackground.\nThe 2008 Rugby League World Cup was the thirteenth staging of the Rugby League World Cup since its inauguration in 1954, and the first since the 2000 tournament. The tournament was held in Australia from 26 October, culminating in the final between Australia and New Zealand on 22 November. The two teams had played each other once already at this World Cup in the opening ceremony where Australia ran out easy winners.\nThe match was Australia's tenth consecutive World Cup final having played in each one since the second-ever in 1957, and New Zealand's third.\nRoute to final.\nAustralia.\nAustralia went into the final as favourites, having not only won every game of the tournament beforehand, but each with margins ranging from 24 to 52 points. \nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand's only defeat going into the final was against Australia in the group stage.\nPre-match.\nLang Park was selected as the venue to host the final. Ashley Klein from the Rugby Football League was selected to officiate the match.\nAustralia went into the match as clear favorites. They had won 9 of the previous 12 tournaments, including the last six consecutively. Australia had also not lost since 2006. New Zealand had won the Tri nations in 2005 but had lost to Australia eight times in a row since that victory. The TAB offered odds of more than 20 to one on a Kiwi win by more than 13 points and New Zealand were paying $6.25 to win at many outlets. Suncorp Stadium was sold out months in advance for the final. The captains of both teams, Nathan Cayless and Darren Lockyer, were the only players in this match who had also played in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup final.\nGeoff Sewell performed the New Zealand national anthem, while Rebecca Tapia performed the Australian national anthem. The game started off with the traditional haka after the national anthems. During the haka the Australian team advanced towards the New Zealand team so that they were standing face to face.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nAt halftime Justin Morgan said on the BBC \"It has been a great display from both teams in the first half. The Kiwis have been a little unlucky but they are still in the game and I would like to see them put the ball in the air more in the second half and see if they can get some results.\"\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Final/&gt;\nPost-match.\nThe game was the Australian team's first loss since Great Britain defeated them in November 2006 and their first loss to New Zealand since November 2005. It was also their first loss in a World Cup match since 1995 and in a final since 1972.\n1.2 million Australians watched the game live on television.\nRicky Stuart, coach of the Australian team, was reported to be so incensed by his team's defeat in the final that he verbally attacked Geoff Carr, the Chief Executive of Australian Rugby League, claiming that tournament organisers and match officials conspired to cause the Australian loss. The next morning he had a chance meeting with Ashley Klein, who refereed the final, and Stuart Cummings, the Rugby Football League's director of match officials, at their hotel. He reportedly abused both officials in front of a number of witnesses, calling Klein a cheat, and behaved in an aggressive and physically intimidating manner. Stuart later apologised for his behaviour and resigned from his post.\nHundreds of New Zealanders welcomed the team home at Auckland Airport. The Kiwis were nominated for team of the year in the Halberg Awards but lost to the gold medal rowing pair of Caroline and Georgina Evers-Swindell."

        "text": "George C. \"Scoops\" Carey (December 4, 1870 – December 17, 1916) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman for four seasons between 1895 and 1903. He played for the Baltimore Orioles, Louisville Colonels, and Washington Senators. His best season came in 1902, when he finished with 35 doubles, 11 triples and a league-leading fielding percentage. After his MLB career, Carey played in the minor leagues and managed there for one season. After his baseball days, he lived in East Liverpool, Ohio, where he died at the age of 46.\nBiography.\nCarey was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended West Virginia University and started his professional baseball career in 1892. He came into prominence that year playing first base for the Altoona Mountaineers in the Pennsylvania State League. He soon earned a reputation as a good-fielding first baseman. After a few years in the minors, he made his major league debut with the Orioles in 1895, replacing future Hall of Famer Dan Brouthers. Carey led all National League first basemen in fielding percentage, and Baltimore won the pennant. He set his major league career highs in home runs (with 1) and runs batted in (75). However, Carey's OPS+ was just 62, and the following April he was sold to the Eastern League's Syracuse Stars.\nHe was a popular player in Syracuse and was the only player to ever hit the ball over the center field fence at the old Star Park. A Syracuse sports writer later described Carey's shot as follows: \"He gave the ball such a terrific smash one day that it went over the center field fence like a scared projectile from a ten-inch gun. Had it not been for the attraction of gravitation it would never have come to earth again.\" In 1897, Carey had a good year in the Atlantic League, batting .354 to finish fourth in the circuit. He got another shot in the majors in 1898 with Louisville. In eight games, he hit just .188 and was sent down to the minors again. In 1901, he rebounded with a .316 batting average to earn his final shot in Major League Baseball, this time with the American League's Senators.\nCarey played one and a half seasons with Washington. 1902 was the best season of his career. He hit .314 with 35 doubles and 11 triples and achieved an OPS+ of 117. For the second time, he led a major league in fielding percentage for first basemen. Carey started 1903 in the Washington starting lineup again; however, he struggled at the plate and played his final major league game on July 6. Carey is the only player in MLB history to lead two different leagues in fielding percentage in a two-season career. For the next eight years, Carey bounced around the minor leagues. He never batted .300 again. In 1910, he managed the Class D Jonesboro Zebras and then retired the following season.\nAfter his baseball career ended, Carey became a painter and lived in East Liverpool, Ohio. He was converted by the evangelist Billy Sunday. He died at the age of 46 from mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation, which one newspaper described as \"leakage of the heart.\""

He was educated at Harrow before matriculating to Clare College, Cambridge in 1890. Gowans joined the British Army as an officer in the Durham Artillery Militia, a militia regiment, where he was promoted to captain on 13 May 1896. He volunteered for active service fighting in South Africa during the Second Boer War, and left Southampton with other men of the regiment in the SS \"Umbria\" in March 1900. From March to June 1900 he served in operations around Natal and later around the Zululand Frontier, including the defence of Forts Itala and Prospect, and the following year he was promoted to the rank of major on 9 November 1901. For his actions during the conflict he was mentioned in dispatches (final despatch by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902) and also received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), the Queen's South Africa Medal with three clasps and the King's South Africa Medal with two clasps.\nIn 1902 he married Erin Laura Muriel, daughter of William Wheelwright of Durban, and settled in South Africa.\nGowans served his country again during the First World War, serving as a temporary lieutenant colonel in the Royal Field Artillery, and was mentioned in despatches on another two occasions.\nRugby career.\nGowans first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Cambridge University whilst a student at Clare College. He played in two Varsity Matches in 1892 and 1893, winning two sporting 'Blues'. Gowans played his rugby on the wing and was first capped for Scotland, while still a Cambridge student, in the 1893 Home Nations Championship, against Wales. His seven others caps for Scotland were also in Home Nations encounters and he took part in their successful 1895 campaign where they claimed their first ever Triple Crown. It was during the 1895 tournament that Gowens scored his first international points, scoring a match winning try in the encounter with Wales. He would score one more try, in his final match, during the 1896 game against England.\nCricket career.\nIn 1891, Gowans played a first-class cricket match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Cambridge University. Playing as a wicket-keeper, he top scored in their first innings with 40 and wasn't required to bat in the second. The bowler who dismissed him, Cyril Wells, was also a rugby union international, representing England."

First-class or List A cricket, provincial rugby and international cricket or rugby are considered to be high level for the purposes of this list. To be eligible, players must have appeared for their country's national side in at least one of the sports. The lists below are alphabetical and sorted by the country in which the player spent their international career.\nAlfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury, who organised the first British Isles rugby tour to Australasia in 1888 were also noted cricketers.\nWhile the Wales national rugby union team is a force in international rugby, the Wales national cricket team plays only rarely, and the nation of Wales is usually subsumed under England for cricketing purposes.\nBoth Irish rugby players and cricketers, unlike soccer players, also play as one nation.\nThe two sports have also had a considerable overlap in commentators and journalists, e.g. Robert Hudson, Howard Marshall, Lisa Olson, Denzil Batchelor, Ian Smith, Steve James, Allan Massie\nMany venues, including St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground, Carisbrook, Eden Park, Raeburn Place, Headingley Stadium, Sydney Cricket Ground, McLean Park, The Oval, Cardiff Arms Park and Limavady Cricket and Rugby Club have been used for both rugby and cricket over the years.\nDue to the historical relationship between rugby league and rugby union, several of these players have also competed in high level rugby \"league\" as well.

        "text": "John Hardin Oldham (November 6, 1932 – February 24, 2024) was an American Major League Baseball player. Although he was a pitcher during all of his professional career, Oldham's only MLB appearance came as a pinch runner for the Cincinnati Redlegs in the 1956 season; he is one of only two pitchers (the other being Larry Yount) who appeared in a major league game without throwing a single pitch.\nCollege.\nOldham was a three-year letterwinner at San Jose State University, from 1952 through 1954. A member of the school's Hall of Fame, Oldham still holds the Spartans' career and single-season records for strikeouts and walks; he also ranks among the school's top ten for career wins, and career and single-season innings pitched. He was the first Humboldt Crabs player to play in the Major Leagues.\nProfessional.\nOldham was signed by the Redlegs out of San Jose State in as a pitcher. He spent that season with the minor league Columbia Reds of the South Atlantic League. In , he pitched for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, where he had a record of 9–6 and an earned run average of 3.84.\nDespite not appearing in a single minor league game in 1956 (due to an injury), the Redlegs called Oldham up in September. On September 2, 1956, he entered the game against the Chicago Cubs in the third inning at Crosley Field in Cincinnati as a pinch runner for Ted Kluszewski, who himself had pinch-hit for third baseman Alex Grammas. The next batter popped out and Oldham was replaced on defense by Rocky Bridges. Although he pitched for three more seasons in the minors, his MLB career was over.\nOldham batted right and threw left-handed, which was itself unusual: , only 553 players in MLB history (about 3% of all players) hit right and threw left.\nCoaching.\nFrom 1970 to 1984, Oldham coached baseball at San Jose City College. From 1985 to 1997, Oldham coached the Broncos of Santa Clara University, leading them to four NCAA appearances and three West Coast Conference championships. His final record at Santa Clara was 433–324–6, a .571 winning percentage.\nDeath.\nOldham died in San Jose, California, on February 24, 2024, at the age of 91."

        "text": "The 2010 Winter Olympics Torch Relay was a 106-day run, from October 30, 2009, until February 12, 2010, prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Plans for the relay were originally announced November 21, 2008, by the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC). Communities were initially informed in June 2008, but the locations were not announced for \"security reasons\". Exact routes were later announced several weeks before the start of the torch relay.\nThe torches used in the Olympic relay were designed by Leo Obstbaum (1969–2009), the late director of design for the 2010 Winter Games.\nThere were an estimated 12,000 torchbearers, including notable Canadian celebrities such as Shania Twain, Simon Whitfield, Silken Lauman, Alexandre Despatie, Catriona Le May Doan and John Hayman and past and present NHL hockey stars including Sidney Crosby, Wayne Gretzky, and the captains of the Vancouver Canucks teams that went to the Stanley Cup Finals, Trevor Linden () and Stan Smyl (). In fact, many television personalities were selected as torchbearers for the relay, mainly from CTV's parent company, CTVglobemedia. Matt Lauer and American actor, bodybuilder, and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger were also torch bearers.\nOn 22 October 2009 the Olympic Torch was lit during a ceremony held at the Ancient Olympia in Greece. Actress Maria Nafpliotou played the role of the High Priestess and ignited the flame using a parabolic mirror and the sun's ray. The first torch was carried by Olympic skier Vassilis Dimitriadis.\nKept under close secrecy, the final Olympic Torchbearer turned out to be not one, but five final torchbearers. Rick Hansen brought it into BC Place Stadium, in turn lighting Catriona Le May Doan's torch, who lit Steve Nash's torch, and the flame continued to Nancy Greene and Wayne Gretzky. Three of the four torchbearers lit the indoor Olympic Cauldron; Le May Doan remained with her torch due to a malfunction causing only three of the four arms to be raised. Gretzky exited BC Place, with his torch still lit, and caught a ride on the back of a VANOC vehicle, to Coal Harbour, where he lit the outdoor Cauldron. This makes Gretzky the first person to light two official cauldrons in the same Olympics.\nAt the start of the closing ceremony, Le May Doan re-lit the indoor Cauldron after clown and mime Yves Dagenais \"fixed\" and \"raised\" the arm that malfunctioned in the opening ceremony.\nRelay elements.\nTorch.\nThe torches used for 2010 relay and the lighting ceremonies were made by designers at Bombardier Inc.'s Aerospace division."

        "title": "Colonial League (baseball)",
        "text": "The Colonial League was the name of two mid-level American minor baseball leagues. The first Colonial League was a Class C level league that existed from 1914 to 1915 as a minor league for the outlaw Federal League. The second Colonial League existed from 1947 through mid-July 1950. It was graded Class B, two levels below the major leagues, and featured teams based in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey\nHistory.\n1914 to 1915.\nThe Colonial League began to operate as a Class C level league based in Southern New England in the 1914 season. In April, Alexander Bannwart drew notice by acquiring Big Jeff Pfeffer to manage the team in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. By May, it was suspected that Bannwart was working as an agent of the Federal League, an outlaw league working outside of the National Agreement. Bannwart denied this. Upon these news reports, some of the founding members of the Colonial League resigned, fearing banishment by the National Baseball Commission.\nThough Charles Coppen was nominally the president of the Colonial League, Bannwart began to exert authority at the Colonial League offices. Later in the 1914 season, Bannwart drew anger when he attempted to make last-minute changes to the schedule designed to increase competitiveness in the standings and maximize profits at the box office. Due to the backlash from the teams, the schedule was not changed. The league was reported to have lost $22,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in 1914. After the season, Bannwart unsuccessfully petitioned the National Commission to reclassify the Colonial League as Class B.\nAt the April 1915 league meeting, Coppen was re-elected as president and Bannwart was elected secretary. Walter S. Ward, the treasurer of the Brooklyn Tip Tops of the Federal League and son of George S. Ward, an owner of the Tip Tops, was elected as the league's treasurer. Wanting to expand into Springfield, Massachusetts, and Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut, territory that belonged to the Eastern Association, the Colonial League reorganized itself as a farm system for the Federal League and voluntarily withdrew itself from organized baseball. The Colonial League struggled financially in 1915, and Bannwart's policies were blamed. The quality of baseball was deemed to be below the expected standards of a Class C league in part due to the salary maximums set by Bannwart, diminishing fan interest in the league. In August 1915, Bannwart resigned from the Colonial League. The league collapsed during the 1915-16 offseason.\n1947 to 1950.\nThe Colonial was one of many minor leagues that briefly existed during the post-World War II baseball boom. It competed in the Northeastern United States with five major league clubs in New York and New England, established minor leagues such as the International League, Eastern League, Canadian–American League, Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League (PONY League), and other fledgling circuits such as the postwar New England League and Border League.\nAs a whole, the Colonial was rarely adopted as a site for farm teams for major league clubs. Only two of its member teams (the 1948 Bridgeport Bees and Port Chester Clippers) ever affiliated with a big league parent club (the Washington Senators and St. Louis Browns, respectively).\nBaseball Hall of Fame member Jimmie Foxx managed Bridgeport in 1949.\nAs the minors began to contract in the late 1940s, the Colonial League's days were numbered. It shut its doors on July 14, 1950, with only 80,000 fans reported to have attended games in the entire six-team circuit.\nStandings &amp; statistics.\n1914 to 1915.\n1914 Colonial League\nNo Playoffs held\n1915 Colonial League\nFall River &amp; Taunton disbanded on July 10.

He played in Major League Baseball for the New York Highlanders in 1908, primarily as a left fielder and shortstop.\nBiography.\nO'Rourke was the son of Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Jim O'Rouke; the father was often called \"Orator Jim\" with the son referred to as \"Jimmy\". John O'Rourke, brother of Orator Jim, was also a major league player. Jimmy O'Rourke attended Yale University, where he played shortstop on the varsity baseball team in 1901 as a freshman. After being unable to play in 1902 for academic reasons, O'Rourke started playing professionally in 1903, ending his collegiate eligibility. He did complete his degree at Yale, graduating in June 1904.\nO'Rourke played baseball professionally from 1903 to 1915, and during 1922 and 1924. His major league career consisted of 34 games for the 1908 New York Highlanders, during which he compiled a .231 batting average with three runs batted in. He started 28 games for New York: 13 in left field, 10 at shortstop, three at second base, and two at third base.\nIn the minor leagues, O'Rourke played over 1200 games in 15 seasons. He batted .303 for the Bridgeport Orators of the Connecticut State League in 1907; records for some of his seasons are incomplete. After apparently not playing professionally from 1916 through 1921, O'Rourke batted .283 in 23 games for the Syracuse Stars of the International League in 1922, and .236 in 88 games for the Ottawa-Hull Senators of the Ontario–Quebec–Vermont League in 1924. In 1923, he served as manager of the Ottawa Canadiens in the Eastern Canada League.\nO'Rourke died in December 1955; he was survived by his wife and a son. While O'Rourke is listed on various baseball references sites under the nickname \"Queenie\", research by the Society for American Baseball Research indicates that the nickname was \"historically contrived\", as it was not known to be used during O'Rourke's career and only appeared after his death."

He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball, from until , all for the Minnesota Twins.\nWilliams was originally signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1975. He pitched two seasons in the Pirates minor league system, but was released by Pittsburgh \nbecause the Nicaraguan Government would not grant him a visa to leave the country to play baseball in the United States. This prompted Williams to sign up with the Sandinista rebels and he was engaged in jungle fighting against the forces of Anastasio Somoza from 1977 through 1978 during the Nicaraguan Revolution.\nIn 1979, Williams had to be smuggled out of Nicaragua and was signed a contract to play in the Inter-American League, where he pitched for the Caracas Metropolitanos and Panama Banqueros clubs. He then joined the Minnesota organization in 1980, where he spent five years. In 1984, he was the starting pitcher in the Twins season opener against the Detroit Tigers at the Metrodome.\nIn between, Williams played six seasons in the Venezuelan Winter League, making an appearance with the Tiburones de La Guaira in the 1983 Caribbean Series.\nBaseball career.\nMinnesota Twins.\n1980.\nOn May 7, 1980, Albert Williams was called up to the Majors to make his debut against the Baltimore Orioles as a starter for 3 innings.

        "title": "Bowling league",
        "text": "A bowling league is a group event where several teams bowl against each other over the course of a season. \nMost bowling leagues consist of four-player teams that meet up once a week or once every other week, usually at the same day and time. Teams of three or five players are also common. Leagues can be set up as male-only, female-only, or mixed. Four-person teams tend to be used in mixed leagues, while three- and five-player teams are more common in male-only and female-only leagues.\nLeagues were established soon after the most modern types of bowling were created in the late 1800s. Leagues may be organized by bowling alleys, or started up by people with a connection outside of bowling such as company, church, or labor union leagues.\nEach session, each team in the league faces one other team. In most bowling leagues, each team plays three games per scheduled match. The players on a team usually bowl in a specific order and across two lanes, switching lanes after every frame. This way the bowlers on each team are equally exposed to favorable or unfavorable lane conditions.\nAfter the first week of the league, the average for each player is set, and the average can go up or down after each subsequent session as more games are bowled. Though there are \"scratch\" leagues where only actual score counts, most leagues use the bowler averages to determine team and/or individual handicaps. The handicap is the difference of the sum of averages between the two teams that are facing each other (sometimes then multiplied by a percentage, such as 90%), or an amount calculated from a score that is above the highest team average in the league so that each team gets a handicap amount. The handicap gives teams with lower averages a chance to compete against teams with higher averages.\nWhile some leagues have a casual attitude towards the rules, other leagues are fiercely competitive. For example, a player that commits a foul might provoke a heated confrontation with other bowlers if he or she does not declare the required zero score for the throw. Another common dispute may be over a player intentionally establishing a lower average early in the season (known as \"sandbagging\") to increase individual handicap or his/her team's handicap.\nThere are often weekly and seasonal cash prizes, along with betting pools that go along with the game. The point of this is to have something to work for in addition to friendly competition. Some leagues will have strike pools or spare pools. This is when team members put in money to play the game. The first person to get a certain number of strikes or spares wins the total amount of money that everyone put in. Some teams play a side poker game in which a player draws a card only after making a strike or spare; best poker hand at the end of each game wins. In some cases, tickets are sold for a league strike jackpot. A ticket is drawn each week and the bowler holding that ticket must roll a strike to win the jackpot. If no one wins it in one week, then the money carries over to the next week until someone finally gets a strike. Other common jackpots are high scratch game, high handicap game, high over-average game, and \"mystery\" game (where a score is drawn and anyone whose game matched that score wins a prize).\nBowling leagues normally attract an adult crowd, whether it is duckpin, candlepin, or ten-pin bowling. However youth bowling leagues are also common, particularly on weekend afternoons.\nLeague scoring.\nLeagues normally consist of weekly sessions that require each bowler on a team to bowl three games per week (or more/less depending on the league's rules). Some leagues have special prize funds accumulated by a small weekly fee (above that which is paid to the bowling center) that can fund prizes at the end of the season.\nIn a given weekly session, each team will face another team in the league in scheduled competition. Teams are awarded point(s) for winning each game, plus point(s) for having more total pins than the other team at the end of all games that week. Point systems vary by league.\nLeague standings are published after each session, and teams with more points at the end of a season (or end of a half in split seasons) generally win the most money or a special prize."

Andretti got off to a slow start to the season, dropping out of the first two races, and finished a heartbreaking second at Indianapolis. But after Indy, he shot to the top of the standings. He won four of the last five races of the season, and needed to finish 6th or better at Laguna Seca to clinch the title.

        "text": "The Providence Rugby Football Club (PRFC) is a rugby union club based in Providence, Rhode Island. Founded in 1969, the club consist of both a men's and women's (PWRFC) rugby teams. PRFC competes in Division III of the New England Rugby Football Union (NERFU).\nHistory.\nProvidence RFC was founded in the fall of 1969 by several local athletes with rugby experience and players from the Brown University rugby team.\nThe club started in 1969, in part due to the efforts of Dave \"Ace\" Zucconi, a Brown alumnus who learned the game while serving in the U.S. Air Force overseas. Zucconi drafted several Brown Alumni to play on Sundays, and in the first year (1969–1970), the team won all of the thirteen matches played.\nP.R.F.C.'s first official season was the spring of 1971. The club was recognized by the New England R.F.U. after an organizational meeting by five of P.R.F.C.'s founders: Mike Diffley, Jay Fluck, Bob Hoder, Bill Mullin, and Hal Wilder. In its first season, R.F.C. posted an 11-0 record, including a second Guinness Championship. Since then, the club has won the annual N.E.R.F.U. championship twice, once in 9199 and 1990, two championships at Saranac Lake, 1976 and 1977, plus several tours to England and Scotland in 1976, Ireland in 1979, and England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1987.\nThe 2005 season saw the club make the National Sweet 16's for the second time in club history, through hard-fought wins in the North East Regional Playoffs against Union, NJ and a highly regarded Hartford team. The successful campaign of 2005 led to a number of retirements, which, when combined with injuries to key players, left Providence with a 4-4 season for 2006.\nAfter finishing just out of playoff competition due to tiebreaker criteria in the fall of 2004, Providence placed second in the Spring NERFU. In 2002, PRFC captured the regular season New England Division II championship by virtue of a 7–1 record.\nFollowing a trip to the National Round of 16 in 2009, Providence underwent a brief rebuilding process with a mix of local and international talent.\nThe 2011 season saw the club achieve a 6–3 record. The collective club efforts culminated in a 50-0 victory over rival Newport to retain the Rhode Island Cup. After 2011, Providence had a long stretch of seasons where commitment became an issue, and they posted a stretch of sub-500 seasons.\nThe 2017 season was a big turning point for the club as things began to turn around for the men's team. With a drop-down to D3, PRFC was able to begin rebuilding with younger talent. With their combination of youth and experience, Providence was able to go 17–1 in two fall seasons and the #1 seed back to back years.\nOn top of the high level of team play, PRFC has produced two MLR players. William Stewart (NOLA Gold) and Mani Young (New England Free Jacks) were both part of the club for a number of years before finding their way into the pros.\nProvidence continues to field highly competitive and successful summer 7's teams. The team has used the summer to foster strong relationships with returning local college players and as a stepping stone to successful conference play in the fall season.\nOld Boys.\nProvidence Rugby has a history dating back to 1969. The club has many former members who play with the Rhody Old Cocks.\nWomen.\nProvidence Women's Rugby Football Club was founded in January 2004 by a group of local college graduates and then Providence College coach Richard Ashfield. The women - who were primarily from Providence College, URI, Stonehill College and Brown University - decided to work with the established men's team in Providence start a sister club.\nFollowing three seasons of summer 7s in which the women's team consistently brought home trophies, including first place at Danbury in 2004, the team faced a challenging 15's schedule in their first season, but have quickly gone from a new club trying to find its footing to a playoff contender, by knocking off the longstanding top teams in the league, Seacoast and Hartford.\nIn 2006, the women rose to the challenge of a tough league schedule to finish with a 4–1 record in league play, and a 5–1 record overall. The season ended in a disappointing fashion: despite completing the season with the same record (4-1) as the other top teams in the division, Providence lost the playoff seed due to the scoring system tiebreaker.\nIn 2007, the women won the NERFU championship and placed third in the Northeast Championship.\nIn 2008, the women won a second NERFU championship and placed second in the Northeast Championship, giving them a chance to go for a National Championship. The women placed fifth in the nation.\nThe women have made a name for themselves as a top club in NERFU DII, losing two league games in the last three years, in a short period of time and with a young core group the team should be a top contender for the league title for years to come."

        "text": "Rugby league in Western Australia is played at amateur level, but attracts an audience particularly for the State of Origin series. \nThe state was represented at national level by the Western Reds/Perth Reds, but they were not included in the new National Rugby League in 1998 following the Super League war. The West Coast Pirates are aiming for eventual inclusion in the National Rugby League.\nHistory.\nThe Western Australia Rugby League was formed in 1948 with Fremantle, Perth, South Perth and Cottesloe as the foundation clubs. In 1950 the Australian Rugby League Board of Control sent ex Kangaroos hooker Arthur Folwell to Western Australia to try to promote the game.\nAlthough touring Great Britain and French rugby league teams had played tour matches in Perth, it was not until the late 1980s that the New South Wales Rugby League played games there. \nNew South Wales Rugby League matches.\nIn August 1989, the NSWRL played the first game outside New South Wales or Queensland, with a crowd of 21,992 watching Canberra play Canterbury at the WACA.\nSubsequent fixtures between 1990 and 1993 were equally well supported, and the League realised that a Perth team could be successful. Perth's application for the Winfield Cup was accepted on 30 November 1992, along with the South Queensland Crushers, the North Queensland Cowboys and the Auckland Warriors. The early tip for the nickname of the Perth side was Pumas, but the red kangaroo, Western Australia's best-known native animal, was chosen and the team became known as the Western Reds, with the colours of Red, Black, Yellow and White.\nWestern Reds and Super League War.\nWestern Australia's first rugby league team to play in a national competition were the Western Reds, who played in the 1995 and 1996 seasons of the Australian Rugby League. In 1997 they changed their name to the Perth Reds and joined the Super League as inaugural members.\nDespite showing some promise (particularly in the underage competitions) the Reds were not invited to join the National Rugby League in 1998 as part of the agreement to end the Super League war.\nIn 2007 the Western Australia Rugby League re-formed the team as the WA Reds to compete in the Jim Beam Cup from 2008, with a view to entering the National Rugby League competition in 2012. Their home ground is Perth Oval.\nNRL and State of Origin series in Perth.\nOn 14 February 2009 Perth Oval played host to the first NRL pre-season match for the year between St George-Illawarra Dragons and Sydney Roosters. The match was a one sided affair but a great stepping stone for WA Rugby League with just under 10,000 supporters in attendance.\nOn Saturday 13 June 2009 at Members Equity Stadium, Perth the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Melbourne Storm played in front of a crowd of 15,197. The Melbourne Storm ran out winners 28–22 in a very successful night for organisers of the Rabbitohs who took their home game to Perth, the NRL and the WARL (Western Australia Rugby League), who now have even more reasons to seriously consider a bid to have the WA Reds back into the Elite Rugby League Competition (NRL). The Rabbitohs again hosted one of their home games in Perth 2010, on the back of the success of the 2009 encounter, again against the Storm. In 2011, the Rabbitohs' played the Brisbane Broncos on a Friday night, a rarity in such a foreign territory for the NRL.\nThe National Rugby League played a double-header at Perth Stadium in round 1 of the 2018 NRL season in front of 38,842 fans.\nIn recent years State of Origin series matches between Queensland and New South Wales have been showcased in Perth in an effort to grow the code's audience, attracting fans from across the country. The second match of the 2019 State of Origin series between New South Wales and Queensland was played at Perth Stadium on 23 June 2019 and marked the first Origin game to be played in Western Australia. New South Wales defeated Queensland 38–6 in front of a record crowd for the code in the state of 59,721 spectators. The second match of the 2022 State of Origin series was also played in Perth, attracting an attendance of 59,358.\nGoverning body.\nThe Western Australia Rugby League (WARL) is responsible for administering the game of rugby league in Western Australia. Western Australia is an Affiliated State of the overall Australian governing body the Australian Rugby League.\nWARL competitions.\nWARL Premiership.\nThe NRLWA, sponsored as the Fuel to Go and Play Premiership, is the premier rugby league football competition in the state. The majority of the Eleven clubs originate in the Perth metro area and both Fremantle and South Perth are foundation WARL clubs. Junior grades run from under 6's up to under 16's and senior competition is divided into four divisions, Men's First Grade, Men's Reserve Grade (Val Murphy Trophy), Women's Tackle and Women's League Tag (Flag Belt).\nRegional Competitions.\nPilbara Rugby League.\nThe Pilbara Rugby League is a seven club competition in the north-west of Western Australia. The clubs are:\nState Representative Team.\nThe WARL also forms a state team to compete in the Affiliated States Championship each year. Western Australia is considered to have the strongest state team of the three non-rugby league states in mainland Australia and have won most of the Affiliated States Championships."

World number 1 Rafael Nadal needed three sets to beat Simone Bolelli and David Ferrer equally took three sets to advance against Jürgen Melzer. Thiemo de Bakker, who was ranked at #242 in the world rankings and one of only two Dutchmen in the competition, lost his first round tie against Andreas Seppi. The other home player, Jesse Huta Galung, gave seventh seed Jo Wilfried Tsonga a real game but lost out on two tie-breaks. Andy Murray beat former top three player Ivan Ljubičić while Gaël Monfils took the first set against Swiss player Stéphane Bohli before his opponent had to retire injured.\nSeeds began to fall in the second round: Nikolay Davydenko, Gilles Simon and David Ferrer exited the competition with defeats to Julien Benneteau, Mario Ančić and Mikhail Youzhny respectively. Nadal overcame the loss of the second set against the 2008 junior champion Grigor Dimitrov to win 7–5, 3–6, 6–2. Murray defeated Seppi 7–6, 7–6 and Monfils beat fellow Frenchman Michaël Llodra. The quarter-final line-up was completed by Marc Gicquel (who had the opportunity to play after Soderling's withdrawal) and Tsonga who defeated Dmitry Tursunov.\nIn the quarter-finals Rafael Nadal beat Frenchman Tsonga 6–4, 7–6, 6–4 to set up a match with Monfils in the semi-finals, who beat Julien Benneteau 7–6, 6–1. Mario Ančić continued his good form from the Zagreb tournament the previous week by beating Mikhail Youzhny 6–4, 6–2 in their quarter-final match. Marc Gicquel was forced to retire from his quarter-final against Murray when Murray was leading 7–6, 4–6, 3–0.\nIn the first semi-final match, despite initial fears that he would not be able to play due to an ankle injury, Murray beat Ančić 6–1, 6–2.\nDoubles.\nThe #1, #2 and #4 seeded doubles pairs all progressed through the first two rounds to reach the semi-finals. Top seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić recorded identical scorelines of 7–6(2), 6–4 in their opening two matches, defeating singles players Dmitry Tursunov (the champion the previous year with Tomáš Berdych) and Gilles Simon in the first round before beating Italians Andreas Seppi and Simone Bolelli. The #2 seeded pair of Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes won on a final-set champions tiebreak against Christopher Kas and Philipp Kohlschreiber, then proceeded to win 6–2, 6–1 against Igor Andreev and Marcin Matkowski in the quarterfinals. The Julian Knowle and Andy Ram partnerships also reached the semi-finals after a straight sets victory over Andy Murray and James Auckland in the first round and victory over the French pair of Arnaud Clément and Michaël Llodra in the second round. The #3 pair of Jeff Coetzee – Wesley Moodie were defeated in the quarter-finals by Tomáš Berdych and Jürgen Melzer 4–6, 66-7."

        "title": "Disqualification (boxing)",
        "text": "A disqualification (abbreviated DQ) is a term used when a bout is stopped short of knockout or judges' decision because, intentionally, one or both contestants have repeatedly or flagrantly fouled an opponent or violated other rules. The disqualified boxer automatically loses the bout to the opponent. If both are disqualified, (termed a double disqualification) the result is usually declared a no contest regardless of round. \nMost disqualifications happen for repeated intentional fouling such as headbutting, low blows, rabbit punches, biting and the like. Typically, a referee will first verbally warn offenders or direct a point deduction first before disqualifying a boxer. However, contestants may be disqualified without warning for particularly egregious conduct such as kicking a downed opponent, hair pulling, or using loaded gloves. Secondly, violation of other rules by a fighter's corner, such as cornermen entering the ring or striking the opponent can result in disqualification even though such behavior is not strictly under the fighter's control. A boxer may also be disqualified if the referee deems that he or she is not fighting, or holding excessively. \nDisqualification occurs solely at the referee's discretion and no fouled contestant is automatically entitled to such a result. \nExamples.\nA famous DQ in boxing occurred in the 1997 HolyfieldTyson II match, when Mike Tyson was disqualified in the 3rd round for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. Notably, this was the first disqualification in fifty years, the most recent one to that point being a match between Joe Louis and Buddy Baer in 1941, which saw Baer be DQ’d after his cornermen refused to leave the ring after a perceived late hit."

        "text": "In cricket, a tie occurs when the match is concluded with each team having scored exactly the same number of runs and the side batting last having completed its innings. The definition of a completed innings would be if all ten batsmen have been dismissed or the pre-determined number of overs have been completed. It is rare for first-class matches to end in ties and, in more than 200 years of first-class cricket, it has happened on just 67 occasions, two of those in Test matches.\nThe earliest known instance of a tie is in a single wicket \"threes\" match at Lamb's Conduit Field on Wednesday, 1 September 1736. Three London players were matched against three of Surrey. Although the sources give different totals for each innings, they are agreed that both teams totalled 23 overall. London batted first and scored either 4 and 19, or 3 and 18. Surrey replied with either 18 and 5, or 17 and 6. Five years later, the same two teams produced the earliest known tie in an eleven-a-side match. The first tie in a match later given first-class cricket status was in 1783 between a Hampshire XI and a Kent XI.\nA tie was previously sometimes declared where the scores were level when scheduled play ended, but the side batting last still had wickets in hand. In 1948, the rules were changed so that when this occurs the match is declared a draw. This happened in a Test between England and Zimbabwe in 1996. England needed 205 to win the match in their fourth innings, off 37 overs, but finished the day 204/6. With three runs required off the last ball, Nick Knight was run out going for the third, thus making it the first time in Test history that a match had finished drawn with scores level. It happened again in 2011, in a Test between India and the West Indies at Mumbai, this time with nine wickets down in the fourth innings.\nIn January 2021, the final of the 2020–21 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy in Pakistan finished as a tie, the first tie in the final of a domestic first-class cricket tournament.\nBelow is a list of all first-class matches that have been declared tied, including those before 1948 which would have been draws in the modern era."

In a sponsored walk in March and April 2008, to celebrate the anniversary, members hit a cricket ball the 140 miles from Lords to their ground and back again.\nThe club's old minute books show that the present cricket club was reformed on May 10, 1904 and that cricket was played at the turn of the century on the field that is now Horsebridge Recreation Ground. Several years later Hellingly moved cricket grounds around the village until in 1953 a new cricket pitch was laid and a pavilion was erected back at Horsebridge Recreation Ground.\n1972 saw six local clubs get together to form the East Sussex Cricket League. Hellingly in 1975 were the tenth team to join the league. Today the league has grown and now has twelve divisions with over 110 teams playing in it. In 2007, Hellingly made the decision to join the Sussex Cricket League, and 2008 saw them join the new 'Division 3 East' of the league.\nGrounds and Facilities.\nThe Club plays its home games at Horsebridge Recreation Ground and Ninfield. Ninfield is used for third and fourth eleven games, and Horsebridge is used for all other home matches.\nHorsebridge Recreation ground has a bar and Clubhouse, four sight-screens, two permanent nets as well as a roller net. In 2006-07, Wealden District Council granted £3,400 towards major ground care equipment, including a small electronic scoreboard and a 'slip cradle' . Planned improvements for 2011 are for a temporary score box to be built at the ground, as well as improvements to the square.\nCompetitions.\nThe club has teams in various local leagues. The 1st and 2nd eleven teams play in the Sussex Cricket League in division 3, whilst the 3rd and 4th elevens play in division 9 and 11 of the East Sussex Cricket League. The club also has teams at under 8, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 18 age groups. 2010 saw a successful return of a Sunday side at Hellingly, playing friendly matches throughout the season. In January it was announced that the club has been accepted into the National Village Knock-out Cup for the 2011 season.\nHonours.\nThe main cup that Hellingly enter each year is the Oakshott Knockout Cup, which the club has won on 13 occasions\nWinners: 1948, 1949, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1966, 1969, 1986, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2010\n2010 season.\nOut of the club's 252 year history, 2010 was the club's best year to date, which included the following silverware,\nThe Ashrose media team.\nAlthough only playing in Division 3 of the Sussex League, you could be mistaken for thinking the club was playing in the County Championship, with every Saturday and Sunday first team fixture filmed from start to finish, using a range of cameras, camcorders and laptops. This allows the club to post videos, photos and detailed match reports from the games to websites and various local newspapers. 2010 saw the club post over 200 reports of every single game played in the season to four Newspapers, as well as the introduction of a monthly newsletter. The club has recently gained a permanent Internet connection and for the 2011 season they aim to allow members and followers of the club to get updates from the Hellingly website whilst the games are in progress."

A sequel to \"\" (2002), it is the third installment in the \"Asterix\" film series.\nAt the time of its release, it was the most expensive French and non English-language film of all time. The film was negatively received by critics, but performed well at several European box offices, topping charts in Poland, Spain and France.\nPlot.\nAstérix and Obélix must win the Olympic Games in Greece in order to help their friend Lovesix marry Greek princess Irina. Brutus uses every trick in the book to have his own team win the game and get rid of his father Julius Caesar in the process.\nThe film is loosely adapted from the original \"Asterix at the Olympic Games\" comic book. The love story subplot between Lovesix and Irina was not featured in the original story. Brutus, portrayed here as a comical villain with no relation to his depictions in \"Asterix\" comics, is the main antagonist, although he was not even featured as a character in the original comic book.\nCast.\nThere is a cameo of Adriana Karembeu as Mrs Geriatrix and Jamel Debbouze reprises his role as Numerobis. Italian comedy actor Enrico Brignano appears as a reporter.\nThe film featured several cameos by real-life sports stars, most prominently by Michael Schumacher as Schumix, but also Jean Todt, Zinedine Zidane, Tony Parker and Amélie Mauresmo. The part of Roman athlete Claudius Cornedurus (Gluteus Maximus), played by Jérôme Le Banner, was originally to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme.\nProduction.\nFilming.\nFilming took place in Alicante (including the Ciudad de la Luz studio), Spain and lasted six months.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film grossed $23.4 million in France in its opening weekend, which was more than 60% of its gross in 19 territories in which the film was released. Box Office Mojo estimated $38.7 million in revenue within a week after the film was released."

        "title": "Basketball Western Australia",
        "text": "Basketball Western Australia (a.k.a. the Western Australian Basketball Federation) is the governing body of basketball in Western Australia and is responsible for the development and promotion of the sport at a state and local level.\nHistory.\nThe Western Australian Basketball Federation (WABF) was founded in 1946 as the Western Australian Basketball Association, which later became known as the Amateur Basketball Association of Western Australia. The original Western Australian Basketball Association was formed by a small group of basketball enthusiasts at the Perth YMCA on Murray Street on Wednesday, 3 April 1946. The sport had already been played across the state for 35 years, but there had been no official management or promotion of the sport. John Leonard, a highly respected Perth businessman, athlete and two-time winner of football's coveted Sandover Medal, played a key role in orchestrating the first meeting on 3 April 1946. The initial aim was to form a body that would manage, control and promote the development of basketball in Western Australia. The resulting winter competition played at Claremont Showground saw teams compete for the John Leonard Perpetual Shield.\nAfter the 1962 Commonwealth Games, the WABF's headquarters switched to the newly built Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium. The A Grade competition continued until 1972, when it was renamed the District Competition, involving seven association teams, although this was soon increased to eight. This format continued to 1987, although the competition underwent several name changes as sponsors began to show their interest. 1987 was something of a watershed year for the WABF, as the entire structure of the game in Western Australia was being reconsidered.\nThe impetus for the rethink was the dire financial straits which the WABF found itself in the previous year. The Perth Wildcats had been a financial burden since joining the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1982, and at the end of the 1986 season, the WABF was $400,000 in the red. A task force was established to sort out the mess, and the upshot was that Perth businessman Bob Williams, sponsor of the Wildcats in 1986, purchased a 60 percent interest in the team from the WABF for $200,000. The WABF's administration was also restructured, with Alan Marshall joining as chief executive with a brief to put the WABF on a firm financial footing.\nA census in 1987 showed that 61 percent of WABF members were from country areas, so it was decided to try to include several country teams in the state's premier basketball league. However, this could not be done until the WABF had traded out its difficulties. Fortunately, the Wildcats had a hugely successful season in 1987—reaching the NBL Grand Final in their first trip to the finals—attracting much television coverage, which saw basketball's popularity soar.\nAn immediate result of the sport's new popularity was the debut of McDonald's as a sponsor. The fast-food chain entered into a $150,000 three-year deal with the WABF, sponsoring the premier competition and funding an extensive junior programme.\nIn 1988, it was decided to form a State Basketball League (SBL) for both men and women, and to develop it into an elite, statewide competition as soon as possible. This meant seeking out private owners and attracting corporate sponsorship, so as to not burden the association. As part of basketball's development, the Western Australian Institute of Sport men's team was included in the SBL under Warren Kuhn.\nSimon Leunig, who had been the WABF's development officer, was appointed general manager of the SBL, and set about organising an expanded league for 1989. His marketing strategy paid off, and three new franchises were established in country areas: the Rainbow Coast Raiders from Albany were the first, followed by the Batavia Buccaneers from Geraldton and the Souwest Slammers from Bunbury.\nThe expanded SBL, which was limited to men's teams in 1989, was sponsored by McDonald's and Skywest, with a $65,000 grant from the State Government to help with travel costs.\nOperations.\nBasketball WA's elite operations consists of the ownership of the Perth Lynx that play in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL), as well as the management of the Perth Wheelcats and Western Stars, who play in the National Wheelchair Basketball League (NWBL) and the Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League (WNWBL) respectively.\nBasketball WA's most prominent competitions are the NBL1 West and the Western Australian Basketball League (WABL). The NBL1 West comprises both a men's and women's semi-professional competition, while the WABL consists of multiple under-age junior divisions.\nSince 2014, Basketball WA has been in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bendat Basketball Centre under a co-management agreement with VenuesWest."

        "text": "The Fifth Test of the 1948 Ashes series, held at The Oval in London, was the final Test in that cricket series between Australia and England. The match took place on 14–18 August, with a rest day on 15 August. Australia won the match by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4–0 series win. It was the last Test in the career of Australian captain Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman in the history of the sport. Going into the match, if Australia batted only once, Bradman needed only four runs from his final innings to have a Test batting average of exactly 100, but he failed to score, bowled second ball for a duck by leg spinner Eric Hollies.\nWith the series already lost, the England selectors continued to make many changes, on this occasion, four. In all, they had used 21 players for the series and were severely criticised for failing to maintain continuity. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss, and elected to bat on a pitch affected by rain. After a delayed start due to inclement weather, the Australian pace attack, led by Ray Lindwall, dismissed England within the first day for just 52. Lindwall was the main destroyer, taking six wickets for 20 runs (6/20). The English batsmen found it difficult to cope with his prodigious swing and pace; four of his wickets were either bowled or leg before wicket. Len Hutton was the only batsman to resist, making 30 before being the final man dismissed. In reply, Australia's opening pair of Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes passed England's score on the same afternoon with no loss of wickets. The opening stand ended at 117 when Barnes fell for 61 and Bradman came to the crease to a standing ovation and three cheers from his opponents. He fell second ball, but Australia reached 153/2 at stumps on the first day.\nOn the second day, Australian batsmen fell regularly once Lindsay Hassett was dismissed at 226/3, most of them being troubled by Hollies, who had been selected after taking 8/107 against Australia for Warwickshire. Morris was an exception and he made 196, more than half his team's total, before being run out as Australia were dismissed for 389. Hollies took 5/131. England reached 54/1 at stumps and by lunch on the third day were 121/2, Hutton and Denis Compton batting steadily. However, they suffered a late collapse to be 178/7 when bad light and rain stopped the day's play. Hutton top-scored for the second time in the match for England, making 64. The next morning, Bill Johnston took the last three wickets as England were bowled out for 188, ending the match. Johnston ended with 4/40 and Lindwall 3/50.\nThe match was followed by speeches from both captains, after which the crowd sang \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" in Bradman's honour. Having been undefeated in their matches up to this point, the Australians maintained their streak in the remaining fixtures, gaining them the sobriquet of \"The Invincibles\".\nBackground.\nAfter the first four Tests, Australia led the series 3–0, having won all but the Third Test, which was rain-affected. They had taken an unlikely win in the Fourth Test at Headingley, scoring 404/3 in their second innings, the highest ever score in a successful Test runchase.\nAustralia had been unbeaten throughout the tour. Between the Fourth and Fifth Test, they played five tour matches. They defeated Derbyshire by an innings, before having a washout against Glamorgan. The Australians then defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets, before drawing with Lancashire, who hung on with three wickets in hand on the final day. Australia's final lead-in outing was a two-day non-first-class match against Durham, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day.\nWith the series already lost, England made four changes to their team. John Dewes replaced Cyril Washbrook—who broke his thumb in a match for Lancashire against the Australians—at the top of the order. Dewes had gained attention after scoring 51 for Middlesex in the tour match against the Australians. In the three weeks between then and the Test, he had scored 105 and 89 against Lancashire and Sussex respectively. However, he had averaged less than 40 for the season and made three consecutive scores below 20 leading into the Tests. The journalist and former Australian Test cricketer Bill O'Reilly condemned the decision, claiming that aside from defending the ball, Dewes was too reliant on slogging towards the leg side with a horizontal bat. O'Reilly claimed Dewes was not ready for Test cricket and that asking him to face the rampant Australians could have psychologically scarred him. He said the selection \"was tantamount to asking a young first-year medical student to carry out an intricate operation with a butcher's knife.\"\nAllan Watkins replaced Ken Cranston as the middle order batsman and pace bowler. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut, and the latter became the second Welshman to play in an Ashes Test. Watkins had scored 19 and taken 1/47 for Glamorgan in their match against Australia two weeks earlier, but had only scored 168 runs at 18.66 and taken 11 wickets in his last six matches. Cranston had made a duck and 10, and taken 1/79 on his debut in the previous Test. While acknowledging Cranston's poor performances and concluding that he had not been of international quality, O'Reilly said Watkins' performance in Glamorgan's match against the Australians \"had not inspired anyone with his ability\" to counter the tourists' bowling.\nEngland played two spinners; left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young replaced fellow finger spinner Jim Laker, while the leg spin of Eric Hollies replaced the pace bowling of Dick Pollard. Hollies was brought into the team because he had caused the Australian batsmen difficulty in the tour match against Warwickshire. He took 8/107 in the first innings, the best innings figures against the Australians for the summer. His performance included bowling Bradman with a topspinner that went between bat and pad. It was part of a month-long run in which he took 52 wickets in seven matches, including two ten-wicket match hauls. Young had taken 12 and 14 wickets in consecutive matches against Northamptonshire and Surrey since his omission following the Third Test, while Pollard and Laker had managed totals of only 2/159 and 3/206 respectively in the Headingley Test.\nHaving made only 5 and 18 in the previous Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were seen as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the time. Their frequent changes meant the home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.\nAustralia made three changes. Having taken only seven wickets in the first four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was replaced by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.\nThe two nations had last met at The Oval in the Fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series, during Australia's previous tour of England. On that occasion, England made a Test world record score of 903/7 declared, and Len Hutton made 364, an individual Test world record. Australia batted in both innings with only nine men because of injuries sustained by Bradman and Jack Fingleton during Hutton's 13-hour marathon effort. They collapsed to the heaviest defeat in Test history, by an innings and 579 runs. It was Australia's last Test before World War II and they had not lost a Test since then.\nHundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements outside the stadium in rainy weather on the eve of the Test to queue for tickets. Bradman had announced his forthcoming retirement at the end of the season, so the public were anxious to witness his last appearance at Test level.\n14 August: Day One.\nEnglish skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week leading up to the match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's decision was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. Jack Fingleton, a former Test teammate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce slowly from the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.\nDewes and Len Hutton opened for England, a move that attracted criticism of Yardley for exposing the debutant Dewes to the new ball bowling of Lindwall and Keith Miller. After Hutton opened the scoring with a single from the second ball of the day, Dewes was on strike. The single had almost turned into a five when Sam Loxton fired in a wide return, but Sid Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Dewes took a single from the opening over—bowled by Lindwall—and thus faced the start of the second over, which was delivered by Miller. Dewes had been troubled by Miller in the past. During the Victory Tests in 1945, Miller had repeatedly dismissed the batsman, and during a match for Cambridge University against the Australians earlier in the tour, Dewes had used towels to pad his torso against Miller's short balls. During his short innings, Dewes was also visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still.\nMiller caused a stoppage after his first ball in order to sprinkle sawdust on the crease. With the second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 2/1. However, despite the early wicket, the bowlers appeared to lack confidence in their run-up on the soggy ground. Bradman made an early bowling change and brought Johnston into the attack to replace Miller after the latter had bowled three overs for the concession of two runs. At this time, Bradman adopted relatively defensive field settings despite the early breakthrough. Bill Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He failed to get the ball in the middle of the bat and it looped up and travelled around . Lindsay Hassett took the catch just behind square leg, diving sideways and getting two hands to the ball. This left England at 10/2 as Denis Compton came to the crease. Lindwall bounced Compton, drawing an edge that flew towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball narrowly evade the slips catchers and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who stopped the ball and waited for Compton to regain his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to run him out. However, this sporting gesture did not cost Australia many runs because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton went for a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch. Bradman later said he had remembered how Compton had been out in exactly the same position in the corresponding match at the same ground during the 1938 series. Fingleton described Morris's effort as \"one of the catches of the season\". England were 17/3, and Crapp came in to join Hutton. At this point, Bradman began to put in place more attacking field settings. Johnston then hit Hutton on the fingers with a ball that rose sharply after pitching. Bradman took Lindwall off after 50 minutes and replaced him with Miller, who then removed Crapp, caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 23/4. When play was adjourned for lunch with England on 29/4, Hutton was 17 while Yardley was on four. According to Fingleton, Hutton \"had never been in the slightest difficulty\". He had played cautiously but did not seem hurried by the bowling. Miller had taken 2/3 from six overs.\nAfter the lunch break, England added six runs to be 35/4, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker. The debutant Watkins came in, having earned a reputation in Glamorgan's match against Australia for hooking. He made several attempts at the shot in his innings of 16 balls. He attempted a hook shot from a short ball and missed before being hit on the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer, having tried to hook the ball downwards in an unorthodox manner akin to a tennis serve. He was then dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped leg before wicket by Johnston for a duck to leave England at 42/6. For his troubles, Watkins also collected a bruise from the hit to the shoulder, which inhibited his bowling later in the match. Lindwall then removed Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Young, all yorked by swinging deliveries in the space of two runs, as England fell from 45/6 to 47/9. This brought Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who then hit the only boundary of the innings, lofting Lindwall for a straight drive back over his head. The ball almost went for six, landing just short of the boundary. The innings ended at 52 when Hutton—who never appeared troubled by the bowling—leg glanced Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon, who caught the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen, while O'Reilly called it \"extraordinarily good\".\nThe match saw Lindwall at his best. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs, taking five wickets for eight runs, and finishing with 6/20 from 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as \"the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket\". Fingleton, who played against the \"Bodyline\" attack in 1932–33, said \"I was watching a man almost the equal of Larwood [the \"Bodyline\" spearhead] in pace ... Truly a great bowler\". O'Reilly wrote Lindwall's \"magnificent performance must go down as one of the greatest bowling efforts in Anglo-Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever.\" Hutton was the only batsman to resist the Lindwall-led attack, scoring 30 in 124 minutes and surviving 147 deliveries. The next most resilient display was from Yardley, who scored seven runs in 31 minutes of resistance, facing 33 balls. Miller and Johnston took 2/5 and 2/20 respectively, and Australia's pace trio removed all the batsmen without Bradman having to call upon Ring's leg spin.\nIn contrast, Australia batted with apparent ease, as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder and did not bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking less than an hour to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove \"the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle\". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in his eyes at the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying \"to suggest I got out, as some people did, because I had tears in my eyes while I was looking at the bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit.\"\nHassett came in at 117/2 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four. Hassett was on 10.\n16 August: Day Two.\n15 August was a Sunday, and thus a rest day. Play resumed on Monday, the second morning, and Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in ten Ashes matches. Overall, it was his seventh century in 14 Tests. It had taken him 208 minutes and he had hit four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply on the first day and were already well in the lead, they had plenty of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller came in and tried to attack, but made only five before overbalancing and stumbling forward out of his crease, allowing Evans to stump him from the bowling of Hollies. Harvey, the youngest player in the Australian squad at the age of 19, came to the crease at 243/4 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another boundary, but the attacking strokeplay did not last. Harvey succumbed to Hollies, hitting him to Young. The young batsman was having trouble against the turning ball, so he decided to use his feet and step towards the pitch of the ball. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Hollies' success against the middle-order prompted Yardley to opt to continue with the older ball even when a replacement was available, a move that was rarely made throughout the series as the pacemen dominated the bowling. Hollies did not spin the ball significantly but relied on variations in flight to defeat his opponents.\nLoxton came in with the score at 265/5 and accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before he fell to the new ball. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. Lindwall came in and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 332/7. Morris was then finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for its numerous hooks and off-drives. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through from the non-striker's end by Tallon, but was too slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out with Australia's score on 389, ending the tourists' innings. Both were caught by Crapp in slips from the bowling of Hollies and Bedser respectively. Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin bowling; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two slow men. Hollies pitched the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into playing front-foot shots from balls that spun after pitching on off stump.\nEngland started their second innings 337 runs in arrears. Dewes took strike and got off the mark from Lindwall when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer rose over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Soon after, Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England 20/1. Dewes had often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty. This was because of his habit of leaning his weight onto his back foot as the ball was being bowled, which meant that a forward lean would instinctively result. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the England innings, which reached 54/1 at the close at the second day's play, which was hastened by bad light.\n17 August: Day Three.\nEarly on the third day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—between bat and pad for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards, leaving the score at 64/2, before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings and took the score to 121 at lunch without further loss. Hutton and Compton were 42 and 37 respectively. Compton started slowly but had accelerated as the adjournment approached. The morning's batting had been relatively slow, with only 67 runs scored in 100 minutes, of which Hutton added only 23. The morning session also featured a tight spell of 13 overs by Ring. The leg spinner did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders. At the other end, Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. There were four men in the off side ring and they had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed steadily and both Johnston and Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were no other scares. Towards the end of the morning session, the second new ball became available but Bradman decided to bide his time. He allowed Johnston to rest after his morning spell and used Lindwall and Miller—delivering off spinners—to bowl with the old ball for the last half-hour before lunch break so that the trio could use the adjournment to recuperate before attacking with the new ball.\nAfter lunch, Lindwall and Johnston took the new ball, and the partnership progressed only four further runs to 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a \"freak slip catch\". Hutton managed to continue resisting the Australians before Miller struck Crapp in the neck with a bouncer. The batsman did not react to the blow and did not bother to rub the point of impact. After hitting a series of cover drives for boundaries, Hutton edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, the home side collapsed. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring dismissed debutant Watkins for two, his only wicket for the match. Watkins swung Ring to the leg side and the ball went straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 167/6. Lindwall returned and yorked Evans, who appeared to not detect the delivery in the poor light, for eight. The umpires thus called off play after Yardley appealed against the light. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play with England at 178/7, having lost 4/25.\n18 August: Day Four.\nEngland resumed on the fourth morning with only three wickets in hand and they were still 159 runs in arrears. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added; the match ended when Hollies fell for a golden duck after skying a ball to Morris, immediately after Yardley's departure. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. Miller claimed 2/22 while Ring bowled the most overs, 28, to finish with 1/44. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match in less than three days of playing time.\nAftermath.\nThis result sealed the series 4–0 in favour of Australia. The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches. Bradman began with:\nYardley spoke after Bradman:\nBradman was then given three cheers and the crowd sang \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" before dispersing.\nThe win brought Australia closer to Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and Australia only had seven further matches to negotiate. They secured three consecutive innings victories against Kent, the Gentlemen of England and Somerset. They then took first innings leads of more than 200 against the South of England and Leveson-Gower's XI, but both matches were washed out. The last two matches were two-day non-first-class matches against Scotland, both won by an innings. Bradman's men thus completed the tour undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\"."

        "title": "2009 PDC World Darts Championship",
        "text": "The 2009 Ladbrokes.com World Darts Championship was the 16th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The event took place at Alexandra Palace in London from 19 December 2008 and 4 January 2009.\nJohn Part was the defending champion, having won the PDC World Championship for the second time in the previous year's final against Kirk Shepherd. However, he was eliminated by Bill Davis on the opening night. Shepherd's poor form in 2008 continued, as he was also eliminated in the first round, by Dutchman Jan van der Rassel. Eventually, the title was won by Phil Taylor, with a 7–1 victory in the final over Raymond van Barneveld. This was Taylor's twelfth PDC world title, and his fourteenth in all; his average of 110.94 against van Barneveld remains a record for the PDC World Championship final.\nThe tournament was also notable for featuring the first ever nine-dart finish at the PDC World Championship, completed by van Barneveld in his quarter-final match with Jelle Klaasen.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nThe televised stages featured 70 players, an increase of two from the previous year. The top 32 players in the PDC Order of Merit on 1 December 2008 were seeded for the tournament. They were joined by 16 PDPA members and 22 international qualifiers determined by the PDC and PDPA.\nThe 16 PDPA members were made up from the top eight players who had not already qualified in the PDC Pro Tour events during 2008 and eight other qualifiers were determined at a PDPA Qualifying event which was held on 6 December 2008 in Telford.\nThese 48 players were joined by 22 international players who qualified through various means. Some of the players, such as the top American, Australian, Danish and Eastern European players were entered straight into the first round, while others, having won qualifying events in their countries, were entered into the preliminary round.\nOrder of Merit\nPro Tour\nPDPA qualifiers\nEuropean Order of Merit\"First round qualifiers\"\nInternational qualifiers\"First round qualifiers\"\nInternational qualifiers\"Preliminary round qualifiers\"\nThere were two notable absentees from this year's tournament. Bob Anderson had resigned from the PDC in 2008 to take part in the BetFred League of Legends, thus ending a run of 25 consecutive appearances in a World Championship stretching back to 1984, while Alan Warriner-Little also did not participate, having made 20 consecutive appearances stretching back to 1989. This meant that Phil Taylor now had the longest unbroken run in World Championships, making his 20th consecutive appearance, while Dennis Priestley was the only other remaining player to have played in every WDC/PDC World Championship since the inaugural event in 1994.\nPrize money.\nThe 2009 World Championship featured a prize fund of £724,000.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was made on 8 December on Sky Sports News by Sid Waddell and Eric Bristow. The preliminary round draw was made on the morning of that date.\nPreliminary round.\nThese matches were played over the course of the first six sessions of the championship, from 19 to 22 December. The winners enter the main draw, and played their first-round matches over the course of 20–23 December. The matches were the best of nine legs, and had to be won by two clear legs unless the score reaches 7–7 in which case the 15th leg would be decisive.\nThe preliminary round draw were as follows:\nLast 64.\nAll games that went to a final set had to be won by 2 clear legs, if after six more legs the players still couldn't be separated, a sudden death leg would take place to decide the winner, i.e. if the set goes to 5–5, a decider would be played.\nRepresentation from different countries.\nThis table shows the number of players in the World Championship, the total number including preliminary round.\nInternational qualifying.\nThe international contingent for the championship have qualified through various means, detailed here:\nContinental Europe Order of Merit.\nThe Continental Europe Order of Merit was used to decide four of the international qualifiers for the event, all of whom would be entered in the first round. The top four players in the Order of Merit who had not already qualified via the full Order of Merit or the Players Championship Order of Merit were, from the Netherlands, Co Stompé (who was the top ranked player on the ranking system mainly by virtue of his German Darts Championship win), second placed Jelle Klaasen, and fourth placed Jan van der Rassel. Third place went to the Serbian-born Austrian Mensur Suljović.\nOf the four qualifiers, three had played in the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship, with Stompé being the only debutant having joined the PDC in June. Klaasen, on his debut in 2008, fell in the first round (albeit in a sudden death leg) to fellow countryman Vincent van der Voort, having missed ten darts to win the match. Van der Rassel fared better in 2008, beating Colin Lloyd 3–2 in his first-round match before dispatching Denis Ovens 4–1 in the second round; however he fell by the same scoreline to Peter Manley in the last 16. Van der Rassel has made two other appearances in the PDC World Championship – in the 2006 event he lost in the second round and in 2004 he lost in the first round. Suljović is making his second appearance in the tournament – in 2008 he defeated Andy Smith 3–2 in the first round before losing out 4–1 to eventual champion John Part in his second match.\nInternational representatives.\nAustralia qualifiers\nThe first Australian qualifier was Newcastle-born Paul Nicholson, making his debut in the PDC World Championship. After the William Cross Pro-Am series of events in Shoalhaven, Nicholson took an unassailable lead at the top of the Australian Grand Prix rankings – the top ranked player here would earn a place in the first round of the World Championship. His performances in Shoalhaven also earned him a place in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts.\nThe second Australian place was given to veteran Russell Stewart, who made 11 appearances between 1984 and 2002 in the BDO World Championship. Stewart won the Oceanic Masters, an event open to all Australian and New Zealand players, to secure his debut in the PDC World Championship, at the first round stage.\nCaribbean qualifier\nSudesh Fitzgerald, of Guyana, won the Caribbean and South American Masters to become the second ever Guyanese player to appear in the PDC World Championship, after Norman Madhoo who qualified for the 2004 event. Fitzgerald is entered in at the preliminary stage of the tournament.\nChina qualifier\nShi Yongsheng became the Chinese representative at the tournament, making this his third successive appearance in the PDC World Championship. Yongsheng played in the 2008 PDC World Championship, beating Indian qualifier Ashfaque Sayed in the preliminary round but losing to Alan Warriner-Little in the first round. He also played in the 2007 PDC World Championship but fell at the first hurdle in a loss to Andy Smith. Yongsheng won the Chinese National Championship to secure his place in this year's event, at the preliminary stage.\nDenmark qualifier\nFor the third year in a row, Per Laursen topped the Danish Darts League to win a third successive place in the PDC World Championship. He was entered in at the first round stage. In 2007, Laursen defeated Colin Monk 3–0 in the first round but narrowly lost 4–3 to third seed Dennis Priestley in the second round, having had eight darts to win the match. In 2008, he lost 3–1 in the opening match of the event to Alan Tabern.\nEastern Europe qualifier\nThe Eastern European qualifier took place on 31 October and was open to players from 14 countries in the area. Hungary's Nándor Bezzeg won the event to become the first ever Hungarian representative at the PDC World Championship, being given a first round place at the tournament. He succeeds the Czech Republic's Miroslav Navratil who won the previous year's Eastern European qualifier to earn a place in the 2008 World Championship. Navratil then went on to defeat Philippines qualifier Rizal Barellano 5–0 in the preliminary round before losing 3–2 to Andy Jenkins in the first round.\nFinland qualifier\nMarko Kantele will be making his debut at the PDC World Championship (and is Finland's first ever representative in the event) in 2009 having won the Finnish Pro Darts Championship. He entered at the preliminary phase.\nGermany/Austria qualifier\nThis qualifying place was decided by the German Darts Corporation rankings, which ranks all German/Austrian players from darts events held in the two countries. Austrian Mensur Suljović topped the rankings, however he had already qualified via the Continental Europe Order of Merit. Therefore, his fellow Austrian, second-placed Hannes Schnier, received the invitation to make his debut in the event. He entered at the preliminary round.\nIreland qualifier\nShane O'Connor won the Irish qualifying event, the inaugural Irish Matchplay, meaning he was entered into the preliminary round of the World Championship, his debut in the event.\nJapan qualifier\nAkihiro Nagakawa was the Japanese representative having won the Japanese National Championship to qualify. Nagakawa played at the 2008 PDC World Championship but lost to Anthony Forde from Barbados in the preliminary round. He will once again appear at the preliminary round this year.\nNew Zealand qualifier\nThe New Zealand qualifier was Warren French who won New Zealand's National Singles Championship. French is no stranger to the PDC World Championship, having accompanied fellow New Zealander Warren Parry to the 2008 event and having played in the 2007 event, where he lost to James Wade in the first round. This year he enters in at the preliminary rounds.\nNorth America qualifiers\nThe 2008 North American Order of Merit was used to decide the three North American qualifiers. Pennsylvanian Darin Young topped the rankings, after a second round appearance in the 2008 Las Vegas Desert Classic and victory in the inaugural North American Darts Championship. As well as qualifying him for the first round of the 2009 PDC World Championship, these results gave him a place in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. Young has twice appeared before in the PDC World Championship, but failed to win a game in either 2005 or 2006.\nBill Davis finished second in the North American Order of Merit having performed consistently well in all American events, and was the only American to qualify for the televised stages of both the 2008 US Open and the 2008 Desert Classic. This ensured him a place in the first round of the 2009 World Championship. Davis appeared in the World Championship in 2007 but lost his first game 3–1 to Andy Jenkins.\nThird placed Canadian David Fatum qualified for the preliminary round of the event, his debut in the World Championship. Fatum's high placing was mainly on merit of his run to the semi-finals of the 2008 US Open, where he was narrowly beaten 3–2 by Colin Lloyd.\nPhilippines qualifier\nLourence Ilagan succeeded Rizal Barellano (who lost in the preliminary round of the 2008 event) to become the 2009 Philippines qualifier. Ilagan won the National Darts Federation of the Philippines qualifier to earn a place at the preliminary round at the Alexandra Palace.\nRussia qualifier\nCurrent BDO Ladies' World Champion Anastasia Dobromyslova received qualification following the withdrawal of the Indian qualifier. She became the second woman to play in the PDC World Championship, following Canadian Gayl King who took part in the 2001 PDC World Championship. Following this, Dobromyslova will join the PDC circuit full-time and therefore is not eligible to play in British Darts Organisation events, meaning she cannot defend her BDO Ladies' world title.\nSouth Africa qualifier\nCharles Losper will return to the Alexandra Palace for this year's World Championship, after victory for the second successive year in the South African Open. Losper appeared in the first round of the 2008 World Championship, where he lost 3–1 to eventual champion John Part. He will be entered in at the preliminary stage this year.\nSBS6 wildcard\nThe Dutch TV station SBS6, who will be broadcasting the World Championship in the Netherlands, originally gave their wildcard to Co Stompé, who joined the PDC in 2008. However, this decision was in early November; mere weeks later Stompé won the German Darts Championship (his maiden PDC title), beating Phil Taylor 4–2 in the final – this earned him a spot in the World Championship by right, via the Continental Europe Order of Merit.\nAs a result, on 30 November 2008, Remco van Eijden was offered and accepted the wildcard, a decision which led to his expulsion from the 2008 Zuiderduin Masters to be replaced by fellow Dutchman and 2009 BDO World Championship qualifier Willy van de Wiel. This was van Eijden's debut in the PDC version of the World Championship, and he was entered in at the preliminary round.\nTournament Review.\nDay One, Friday 19 December.\nFirst round.\nThe opening match of the tournament was an international affair, seeing Spain's Carlos Rodriguez take on sixteenth seed Roland Scholten of the Netherlands. Scholten was struggling with a shoulder/neck injury and in his last televised match – the first round of the 2008 European Championship – he had averaged 52. Rodriguez on the other hand had defeated fifth seed Terry Jenkins in the same tournament. True to form, the first set went to the Spaniard, including a 121 checkout. Scholten then hit back to take the second before Rodriguez included an 11 darter in taking the third set 3–2. The Dutchman included an 11 darter of his own as he took the next set without reply and looked to have the momentum going into the decider, but it was perhaps one set too far as the injury took its toll on Scholten's game and Rodriguez won the set – and the match – fairly comfortably. Scholten did not disgrace himself with an 80 average this time around, though Rodriguez' 88 showed the scoring power that gave him the match.\nA preliminary round game followed between Japan's Akihiro Nagakawa and New Zealand's Warren French, to be contested over nine legs. This was probably for the better as neither player hit top form, both averaging 54, which was a factor in Sky Sports stopping footage of the game halfway through. French had double trouble in the opening legs, letting Nagakawa take a 2–0 lead, but he soon improved, reeling off four legs on the trot to take the match.\nHighly fancied Robert Thornton took on twenty-fifth seed Wayne Jones in the next match. Thornton, the lone Scotsman in the competition, joined the PDC in May 2008 and had already risen up to thirty-fifth in the PDC Order of Merit. Jones, a semi-finalist here in 2006, took the first set, but Thornton, averaging 94, took the next three without reply to win the match.\nThe tournament lit up in the next match as American Bill Davis sensationally defeated the defending champion and fourth seed, Canadian John Part, 3–0. A slow start from Part allowed Davis to take the first set with a 116 checkout, and the American took a two legs lead in the second set with a 120 checkout. This seemed to awaken the defending champion, who hit five 180s in the next three legs, but missed doubles for the set cost him as Davis took a 2–0 lead. The final set went to a deciding leg as well – Part almost completed a 125 checkout, missing the double 20 to save the match before Davis hit double 10 – the same double Part won his world championship on – to wrap up the win.\nThe final match of the night was a high quality affair with both Dutchman Co Stompé and twenty-fourth seed Andy Jenkins averaging 93 and 94 respectively. Both players had defeated Phil Taylor in recent events – Stompé in the final of the German Darts Championship and Jenkins in the group stages of the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts – and Stompé took the first set. A 120 checkout from the Englishman levelled the match but Stompé, himself a newcomer to the PDC this year, hit a 164 checkout – the highest of the tournament – to help him take the third set. The debutant won the final set 3–1 to win the match by the same scoreline, sending the 2007 semi-finalist Jenkins out. This result also meant all four seeds in action had crashed out.\nDay Two, Saturday 20 December.\nFirst round.\nThe afternoon session of the second day of the World Championship opened with fifth seed Terry Jenkins taking on Dennis Smith who was returning to the event after a two-year absence. Jenkins had lost in the first round the previous year to 500–1 outsider Kirk Shepherd, who would then go on to reach the final. His woes at the Alexandra Palace continued as Smith took a comfortable 3–1 victory. Smith took the first two sets before Jenkins looked to stage a comeback with 118 and 107 checkouts helping him take third set 3–0. However, 'Smiffy' put a stop to the resurgence with an 84 checkout on the bull to win the match, meaning all five seeds who had played so far had fallen at the first hurdle.\nThis was followed by a preliminary-round match of considerably better quality than the previous night's. Austrian Hannes Schnier, making his debut in the event, and China's Shi Yongsheng, making a third consecutive appearance, faced off with Yongsheng taking an early lead. Two 180s helped Schnier to take a 4–3 lead before Yongsheng reeled off three legs in succession to take the match 6–4.\nArguably the match of the tournament so far followed as seventeenth seed and semi-finalist last year, Kevin Painter, took on Matt Clark. Clark took the first set 3–2 before Painter hit back taking the second 3–1. 'The Artist' then seemed to gain momentum as he took the next set without reply, including a 100 checkout with two double tops and a 126 checkout on the bull, however 'Superman' Clark comfortably won the next set 3–1 to send the match into a decider. The final set had to be won by two clear legs but no player could open up such a margin as they each held their throw for ten straight legs to send the match into a sudden death leg, something that Painter had famously been on the wrong end of in the 2004 final. Clark won the bull, meaning he threw first, but heavy scoring from Painter meant he was first to a double – he missed one dart at double 16 for the match with Clark left on a 104 checkout. Clark got the required treble 20 but himself missed a dart at double 12 to win the contest. Painter then hit double 8 with his third dart to finally take victory and become the first seed to advance into the second round.\nDennis Priestley, the eleventh seed, had a considerably more comfortable victory against Warren French of New Zealand. French played far better than in his preliminary round game, averaging 76 rather than 54, however Priestley's average of 87 told all as he took all three sets 3–1 for a 3–0 overall victory. Welshman and twenty-ninth seed Barrie Bates had a similarly easy victory over Northern Ireland's Felix McBrearty, dropping three legs before a 101 checkout gave him a 3–0 win to end the afternoon session.\nThe evening session opened with ninth seed Alan Tabern producing a comfortable 3–0 victory over 1996 BDO World Champion Steve Beaton. Tabern's average of 91 to Beaton's 82 was the decisive factor in the match as Beaton only won three legs in his defeat to the 2007 quarter-finalist. This was followed by a third preliminary game, easily the highest quality of the round so far as both the USA's David Fatum, a semi-finalist in the 2008 US Open, and Ireland's Shane O'Connor produced averages of above 75. Fatum led 4–2 before missing seven match darts to let O'Connor peg the match back to 4–4, however Fatum made no mistake in taking the next two legs and the match.\nAnother player from the USA and the highest ranked on the North American Order of Merit, Darin Young, took on Dutch youngster and thirty-second seed Michael van Gerwen in the next match. Young opened with heavy scoring and took the first set before van Gerwen took the next including a 104 checkout that gave the Netherlands player a burst of momentum – he only dropped one leg in taking the next two sets to win the match.\nThirteen-time World Champion and top seed Phil Taylor opened his campaign with a dominant victory over debutant Steve Grubb. Taylor, with a 96 average – the highest of the tournament so far – was never pushed and didn't drop a leg in a whitewash of the qualifier that acted as a warning shot to the rest of the competition. The final match of the day saw twenty-eighth seed Alex Roy meet fast-rising youngster Kevin McDine. McDine took the first set 3–2 and the second 3–1 – a 100 checkout and seven perfect darts in two separate legs helping the Geordie take the latter. Roy seemed to come alive as he took the third set without reply along with a 116 checkout, but McDine included a 108 finish in taking the fourth and final set 3–1 to secure the match, and finish off day two's action.\nDay Three, Sunday 21 December.\nFirst round.\nThe first match of the third day was a tight affair between twenty-first seed Mark Walsh and Jamie Caven. Both were second round losers last year and both averaged 91 in a match where the first break of throw was not until the third set. At 1–1 in sets, Walsh had eight perfect darts towards a nine dart finish but his dart at double 12 fell well short. The following leg he broke Caven's throw and despite a break back from Caven, a 120 checkout saw him take the third set. Caven took the fourth set 3–2 but Walsh, who two years ago went out in the first round with a 71 average due to suffering from dartitis, took the final set 4–2 to go into the second round. The match eventually ended up with a total thirteen 180s between the players; eight were from Walsh which would set a joint-record for the first round along with Adrian Lewis.\nThe next match saw the second best performance from a preliminary round entrant in South Africa's Charles Losper, who faced Guyana's Sudesh Fitzgerald. Losper, who twelve months ago lost 3–1 in the first round to eventual champion John Part, averaged 87 in a tidy 6–4 victory over Fitzgerald, making his debut at the World Championship. Fitzgerald started poorly and let Losper take a 3–1 lead, before a 64 finish helped him level the match. Losper then checked out 95 to retake the lead, but despite Fitzgerald hitting back the next leg, a 180 in the ninth leg and a 14 dart finish in the tenth gave Losper victory.\nThe 2005 runner-up and twentieth seed Mark Dudbridge was next in action against debutant Nick Fullwell in a match that also went to a fifth set. Dudbridge led in the first, but missed doubles let Fullwell steal it before 'Flash' Dudbridge took the next set 3–1 including a 100 checkout. Dudbridge took control of the match by taking the third set without reply, but 'Hero' Fullwell hit a 98 finish in the fourth to send the match into a decider. Dudbridge finally prevailed by taking the fourth set 4–2.\nThirty-first seed Englishman Wes Newton faced off against Danish Per Laursen in the next match. Both suffered first round exits last year and Laursen was condemned to the same fate in a fairly unremarkable match in which both players averaged in the 80s. Laursen took the first set 3–2 but Newton won the next by the same scoreline, before taking the lead with a 3–1 score in the third set (the only set that didn't go to a deciding leg) and finishing the match off with double 4 in the fourth set's decider. A fairly one-sided match followed as eighteenth seed Denis Ovens took a comfortable victory over Steve Maish. Ovens took the first set 3–1 and a tight second set which Ovens won 3–2 with a 15 darter seemed to break Maish's resolve, as finishes of 80 and 120 helped Ovens take the third set without reply to end the afternoon's action.\nThe evening opened with some heavy scoring from number seven seed Andy Hamilton, who set the best average of round one (101.59) in a straight sets victory over Michael Barnard. Barnard did not disgrace himself, averaging 93 and performing 114 checkout, but Hamilton's power play including five 180s ensured he went through while throwing down the gauntlet for the rest of the field.\nWhat followed was one of the most hotly anticipated matches ever in the PDC World Championship. Massive hype had gathered over the appearance of Russian Anastasia Dobromyslova, the Ladies World Champion, facing off against Dutchman Remco van Eijden in a preliminary round game. Both were making their debut in the PDC World Championship and both had been awarded a wild card into the competition. However, Dobromyslova was the clear crowd favourite and the pressure showed on van Eijden as he lost the first leg. This seemed to awaken the Dutchman as he reeled off the next three legs before a thirteen darter helped the Russian to level the match. van Eijden then took the next two legs to win the match and end the dream for Dobromyslova, though both players averaged over 80 in arguably the highest quality preliminary-round match so far.\nCrowd favourite and eighth seed Wayne Mardle then began his World Championship campaign against debutant American David Fatum. The four-time (including last year) semi-finalist did not play his best game, averaging 86 to Fatum's 81, but it was enough to put him through in straight sets, dropping only one leg in the process. While his scoring was nothing to write home about, Mardle's finishing was eye-catching, including a 116 and 106 checkout in a clinical performance on the doubles – it was this part of his game that put 'Hawaii 501' through comfortably as 'The Scorpion' Fatum struggled in finishing off legs.\nThe 2007 champion and second seed Raymond van Barneveld began his challenge for the championship against English qualifier Mark Stephenson. 'Barney', a third round loser last year, was hoping to outdo both Hamilton's average and Taylor's record of not dropping a leg, and, in taking the first two sets 3–0 he looked to be doing just that. van Barneveld included a 13 darter and two 14 dart finishes in rapidly taking the first set, and a 102 finish was crucial in taking the second. However, his third set was less comfortable, as Stephenson gained his first leg with a 126 checkout and then sent the set into a deciding leg. Stephenson, averaging a respectable 88, missed a dart to take the set before 'The Man' wrapped up the game, averaging a strong 100.80 in the process.\nThe final match of the day saw another upset as thirteenth seed Peter Manley fell in a deciding set to Serbian-born Austrian Mensur Suljović. Manley, a three-time runner-up at the PDC World Championship, took the first set with ease including a 124 checkout. He then led 2–0 in the second set before Suljović began to hit back, with two 180s helping him take three legs on the spin to level the match 1–1. Suljović, a second round loser to eventual champion John Part last year, led for the first time in the third set, before 'One Dart' hit a clinical 118 checkout to put him back in the game. However, his scoring was not up to par as Suljović continued to outperform him in that area, and a 101 checkout helped him take third set 3–1. Manley, sensing a defeat, quickly took the next set 3–0 to send the match into a decider. However, it was Suljović (averaging an impressive 91 to Manley's 88) whose nerve held when it mattered most as he broke his opponent's throw early and double ten sent Manley crashing out.\nDay Four, Monday 22 December.\nFirst round.\nThe fourth day only featured play in the evening, and began with a major upset as twenty-second seed Chris Mason fell in straight sets to 67-year-old Irishman John MaGowan. Mason never got going in the match, averaging 83 to MaGowan's 92. All sets went 3–1 in 'Mr Magoo's favour, with the highlight of the match being a 156 checkout from MaGowan in the final set to end Mason's hopes of a recovery – double 4 finally completed a major surprise in the opening game of the night. In the preliminary round game that followed, Finland's Marko Kantele produced the best performance of the preliminary stage with an average of 89 to win 5–2 against Lourence Ilagan of the Philippines. Both were debutants though it was the Finn who settled in earlier, completing a 120 checkout before a 12 darter put him 2–0 up. Ilagan won two more legs but Kantele was always in control and a 60 checkout completed the final preliminary-round match.\nSixth seed young gun Adrian Lewis, twice a quarter-finalist at the World Championship, entered the tournament facing off against veteran Australian Russell Stewart who was making his debut at the PDC version of the event despite making eleven appearances in the BDO World Championship. Lewis stormed through the first set, including three 180s and a 121 finish to complete a 12 darter to take the set. A 111 finish helped him open up the first set 2–0 as the youngster looked to have the match under control, but a sudden loss in form from Lewis and steady scoring from Stewart helped 'Rusty' take three legs on the trot to level the match. Stewart took the first leg of the next set to take the lead from the first time, but 'Jackpot' started to find form again as he punished missed darts at doubles from the Australian to take the third set 3–1. A 105 checkout sealed the match for Lewis in the fourth set – though he only averaged 86 to Stewart's 84, Lewis did hit eight 180s in the match, the most of the round and equalling Mark Walsh's record.\nThe next match was hyped before the tournament as the match of the first round, however it proved to be anything but as 2006 BDO World Champion Jelle Klaasen dropped only one leg in a clinical demolition of tenth seed Colin Lloyd. Both were first round losers last year, and both had had darts to win their matches (Klaasen had missed ten match darts to put away Vincent van der Voort), but Klaasen made no mistake in that area this time as he won the last two sets 3–0 against a disappointing Lloyd – 'Jaws' averaged 86 to 'The Matador's impressive 95. The last match of the night was another one-sided affair as twelfth seed Mervyn King didn't drop a leg against China's Shi Yongsheng. The averages – King with 92 to Yongsheng's 75 – told all as a 105 checkout was the only real highlight in a match dominated by 'The King'.\nDay Five, Tuesday 23 December.\nThe last day of play before the Christmas break featured eight round one games to finish up the first round. First up was twenty-sixth seed Andy Smith, a first round loser last year, taking on debutant Tony Ayres. Ayres took the first set before 'The Pieman' Smith changed gears, hitting two 180s and a thirteen darter to take the second set. An even contest saw Ayres take the third with finishes of 116 and 101 but Smith took the fourth including a 155 checkout. In the deciding set, Ayres quickly took a 2–0 lead before Smith hit a 100 checkout with two double tops to save the game; it was only delaying the inevitable however as Ayres, who hit three 180s to Smith's six, and averaged 86 to Smith's 87, was on target when it mattered – he hit double four cleanly in the next leg to win the match.\nThe next match was an unexpected demolition of twenty-seventh seed Adrian Gray, who did not win a leg in a whitewash defeat by top Australian player Paul Nicholson. Gray only got one dart at a double in the entire match as his average of 84 was blown away by Nicholson's 96 (Nicholson averaged exactly the same as Phil Taylor, who did not drop a leg in his first-round match either). Though Nicholson did not hit any 180s, he did hit showpiece checkouts of 142 and 100 to set up a match with Adrian Lewis in the second round, who had beaten his fellow Australian Russell Stewart the previous day.\nTwenty-third seed Kirk Shepherd was not to have a repeat of his fairytale run to the final in last year's 2008 event as he was defeated in a deciding set by Dutchman Jan van der Rassel. A 106 checkout helped Shepherd lead in the first set, but clean checkouts of 98 and 97 in two consecutive legs ensured that van der Rassel took the first set. Shepherd took the second set 3–1 before the third set went to a deciding leg – 'Rassel Dazzle' held throw to go 2–1 up. The 'Martial Dartist' Shepherd stormed through the fourth set, finishing it with a 126 checkout on the bull, but he could not keep up the momentum as van der Rassel took the final set by two clear legs with a clean 106 checkout. Shepherd's defeat also meant that both finalists from the previous year's tournament had gone out in the first round, the first time this has ever happened.\nThe final game of the afternoon also went to a deciding set though it did not look to be at first as thirtieth seed Tony Eccles shot to a 2–0 in sets lead against Remco van Eijden, the conqueror of Ladies World Champion Anastasia Dobromyslova in the preliminary round. Eccles included a 164 checkout in the first set, which he won 3–0, and though the second set was closer in going to a deciding leg, Eccles came out on top to give himself a strong lead. However, the match was far from over as van Eijden took the third set in a deciding leg with a gutsy 116 checkout, and in the deciding leg of the fourth Eccles missed five darts for the match before van Eijden levelled the match. 'The Viper' Eccles lost the first leg in the deciding set as van Eijden took the lead for the first time, but this provoked him into heavy scoring as he won the next three legs without reply to finally win the match.\nThe evening's play saw fifteenth seed Ronnie Baxter take on the best performer of the preliminary round – Finn Marko Kantele. Kantele took the first set with some eye-catching finishing, hitting checkouts of 124 and 164 both on the bull to carve himself a lead despite superior scoring from Baxter. Though Kantele again finished on the bull with a 122 checkout in the second set, Baxter held his throw under pressure to level the match. From then Baxter only lost one leg in the next two sets as he started to hit good form and Kantele's started to slip away – 'The Rocket' stormed through the third set without dropping a leg and he took the fourth, and the match, with some eye-catching finishing of his own, hitting two double tops to complete a 100 checkout. Baxter's end average of 92 to Kantele's 83 showed that it was his scoring that gave him the edge in the match despite some amazing finishing from the Finn.\nThe fourteenth seed Colin Osborne, a quarter-finalist in 2007 but a first round loser last year, opened his campaign with a clinical straight-sets victory over South African Charles Losper. Osborne rivalled Kantele's finishing as a 121 checkout helped him take the first set without reply, and a 167 checkout – the highest of the first round – was instrumental in opening a lead in the second set, which he later won with a 110 finish. Losper, now with his back to the wall, appeared to gain steam as a 14 darter gave him a two leg advantage in the third set, but Osborne regrouped and a 96 checkout gave him victory in the deciding leg of the set. 'The Wizard' Osborne's average of 95 to complement his finishing also showed that he was very much a threat following the disappointment of last year.\nBrendan Dolan gave third seed James Wade a great scare in the first set of their match – he missed six darts for the set before an under-par Wade, who averaged 88, hit an important 106 checkout to take it and break Dolan's spirit. From then on Wade took six of the next seven legs in winning the following two sets and won the match with a thirteen dart finish to set up a match with Tony Eccles, who had famously knocked Wade out in the first round of the 2008 World Grand Prix as 'The Machine' was the defending champion at the time. The next match was another straight-sets victory for a seed – nineteenth seed Vincent van der Voort won the final first-round match 3–0 against Hungarian Nándor Bezzeg. The first set went to a deciding leg but van der Voort took it under pressure, and like Wade he dropped only one leg in taking the next two sets – a 106 checkout, five 180s, and a 90 average from 'Greased Lightning' proved enough to dispatch the Eastern European qualifier and end the first round.\nDay Six, Saturday 27 December.\nThe tournament resumed and the second round began on day six, which opened with a remarkable match between old PDC stalwart Dennis Smith and young Kevin McDine. In the deciding leg of the first set, Smith missed darts to take the opener so McDine stepped in to take it. The second set also went to a decider, and McDine performed an 11 dart finish to open up a 2–0 lead. Checkouts of 110 and 128 on the bull put McDine 3–0 up and on course for a comfortable victory, but Smith rallied in the fourth and began to hit top form as he broke McDine's throw for the first time in the match to win the set. Two fourteen darters and a fifteen dart finish ensured that Smith continued his resurgence in the fifth set, and he levelled the match in the deciding leg of the sixth set. Smith then led for the first time in the match as he took the opening leg of the deciding set, and he repeated McDine's feat of a 128 checkout on the bull to go 2–0 up. From here there was only going to be one winner as Smith landed double eight to complete a famous comeback. Remarkably, Smith hit thirty-one 140s (the most from one player in a single match) but no 180s, compared to McDine's statistic of fifteen 140s and eight 180s. Both players averaged above 90 in a match that would go down as a classic.\nDay Eleven, Friday 2 January.\nNine dart finish.\nDuring the second leg of the sixth set of the match between van Barneveld and Klaasen, van Barneveld threw the first-ever nine dart finish at a PDC World Darts Championship since the split from the British Darts Organisation in mid-1993, and only the second World Championship nine-darter (first live) after Paul Lim's similar outshot against Jack McKenna in 1990. It was van Barneveld's second nine-darter on live British television after his nine-darter against Peter Manley in week five of the 2006 Premier League, and like his first, he used back-to-back 180s, followed by T20, T19, D12 on 141 to complete the perfect leg.\nTelevision coverage.\nAs they have done for every PDC World Darts Championship, Sky Sports broadcast all 69 matches live in the UK, and for the first time in high-definition. Dave Clark presented the coverage with analysis from Rod Harrington and Eric Bristow. They also commentated on matches along with Sid Waddell, John Gwynne, Dave Lanning, Nigel Pearson and Stuart Pyke. Interviews were handled by Clark, Bristow and Helen Chamberlain."

        "text": "The 2010 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship was held in Italy from 25 September to 10 October 2010. The tournament featured 24 teams to determine the world champions in men's volleyball. In addition to 2006 champion Brazil and host nation Italy, 22 teams qualified for the tournament by means of continental and regional competitions. The matches took place in ten venues across ten Italian cities, with the final being held at the PalaLottomatica, Rome.\nThe tournament was won by Brazil, who beat Cuba in final. Brazil won their third straight world championship having won previously in 2002 and 2006. The podium was completed by Serbia who defeated Italy in the 3rd place match. Brazilian wing-spiker Murilo Endres was named the tournament MVP.\nBrazil's victory continued their eight-year period of domination of world volleyball. Brazil has now won 15 of 17 major competitions since 2002. Brazil's third straight world championship equals the record for consecutive titles set by Italy in the 1990s.\nHost.\nFinals hosts Italy. The tournament was held in ten Italy cities.\nQualification.\nThe regional qualification stage determined the 24 teams that would compete in the championship competition. Two spots were guaranteed to the host country Italy and 2006 champions Brazil. Regional governing bodies were allocated the remaining 22 spots. Africa was granted three, Asia and Oceania four, Europe eight, North America five and South America two places. Qualification competitions took place ranging from January to August 2009.\nPools composition.\nFirst round.\nTeams were seeded in the first two positions of each pool following the serpentine system according to their FIVB World Ranking as of 28 July 2009. FIVB reserved the right to seed the hosts as head of pool A regardless of the World Ranking. All teams not seeded were drawn to take other available positions in the remaining lines, following the World Ranking. The draw was held in Rome, Italy on 28 October 2009. Rankings are shown in brackets except the hosts who ranked 6th.\nFirst round.\nPool A.\nPool A featured host country Italy, as well as Egypt, Japan and Iran. Italy defeated all three teams, while the remaining teams each finished with a 1–2 record. Iran were eliminated by virtue of scoring the fewest points during the three-game schedule.\nPool B.\nPool B featured reigning champions Brazil, as well as Cuba, Spain and Tunisia. Cuba won all three of their matches. Tunisia were defeated in every match and eliminated from the competition. Brazil and Cuba would face each other again in the tournament final, where Brazil would repeat as world champions.\nPool C.\nPool C featured Russia, Puerto Rico, Cameroon and Australia. Russia won all their matches, while Australia were eliminated after going 0–3.\nPool D.\nPool D featured the United States, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela.

It was the country's first medal since they were runners-up in 1998 (then as Yugoslavia).\nFinal.\nThe final was a rematch of Brazil and Cuba, who had met earlier in the first round with Cuba winning 3 sets to 2 in an upset. The final was a different story however, with Brazil winning easily in straight sets 25–22, 25–14, 25–22; one Xinhua journalist called it a 'practice match' for Brazil. Brazil took advantage of a large number of Cuban mistakes, perhaps resulting from the young age of the Cuban team. Leandro Vissotto led Brazil in points with 19 and closed the match with a spike. The match was played before a crowd of 11,605 which included a number of Brazilian football stars based in Italy.\nMarketing.\nSymbol.\nVolly was the name chosen by Internet users and students of the 10 host cities of the World Championship (Ancona, Catania, Florence, Milan, Modena, Reggio Calabria, Rome, Turin, Trieste and Verona), after months of voting. The second most popular name for the mascot was \"Fly,\" while \"Mimmo,\" \"Italo\" and \"Gump\" finished further down the list."

        "text": "Alan Otis Smith (January 15, 1947 – December 19, 2022) was an American basketball player who played for five seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA). A point guard during his career, he played for the Denver Rockets and Utah Stars and once led the ABA in assists in a season.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born in Peoria, Illinois. He also attended Manual High School in Peoria. Smith played basketball, football, and baseball at Manual, earning All-State honors in all three sports. His baseball skill was such that the Chicago White Sox drafted him in the 7th round of the inaugural Major League Baseball draft in 1965. Instead of signing with the White Sox, he opted to attend college.\nSmith was given offers to attend USC and Notre Dame, but he chose to attend Bradley University as a basketball and baseball player. Smith spent four years at Bradley, though his time in college was interrupted by a two-year stint in the United States Army. As a college basketball player, he scored over 1,000 points for Bradley and was named first team All-Missouri Valley Conference in 1971 during his senior season. His college success was honored in 2004 when he was selected to Bradley's All-Century team.\nDenver Rockets.\nIn 1971, Smith was drafted by the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls in the 11th round of the NBA draft; previously, he was also drafted by the Bulls in the 10th round of the 1969 draft. He was also a 4th round draft pick of the American Basketball Association's Denver Rockets (now the NBA's Nuggets) in a separate draft. Smith chose to sign with the Rockets, and he would go on to play for the club for three seasons. In his first season, he served as the backup to point guard Larry Brown while averaging nine points and three assists per game.\nSmith became the Rockets' regular point guard during the 1972–1973 season after Brown took a job as head coach. He scored a career-best eleven-plus points per game in his second season, while averaging five-and-a-half assists per game. His scoring decreased slightly in the 1973–1974 season but he went on to average eight assists per game, and would lead the ABA in assists.\nUtah Stars.\nBefore the 1974–1975 season, Smith was traded to the Utah Stars in exchange for a draft pick and cash. In his first season with the Stars, he averaged a career-low eight points per game, while also averaging four-and-a-half assists per contest.\nHis second season with the Stars lasted only fifteen games before the Stars folded in December. A persistent knee injury eventually ended his career after five seasons. He retired having scored over 3,200 points and having dished out over 1,700 assists.\nTucson Gunners.\nFor the Western Basketball Association, Smith played for the Tucson Gunners in its first and only season from 1978 to 1979.\nPost-basketball life.\nSmith went on to become a social worker in Denver, also working at a cable television supply company. For a year-and-a-half, he served as an assistant head coach at Manual High School, helping lead the school to two state championships. As of 2007, Smith was working in Paterson, New Jersey, as a school counselor.\nDeath.\nOn December 19, 2022, police were called to Smith's apartment in Palmer Ranch, Florida, after he shot his live-in girlfriend. After law enforcement tried to make contact with Smith, it was discovered that he had committed suicide via a self-inflicted gunshot. He was 75."

        "text": "John Brian Patrick Quinn, (January 29, 1943 – November 23, 2014) was a Canadian ice hockey player, head coach, and executive. Known by the nickname \"The Big Irishman\", he coached for the National Hockey League's Philadelphia Flyers, Los Angeles Kings, Vancouver Canucks, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Edmonton Oilers, reaching the Stanley Cup Finals twice, with the Flyers in 1980 and the Canucks in 1994. Internationally, Quinn coached Team Canada to gold medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics, 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships and 2009 World Junior Championship, as well as World Cup championship in 2004.\nPrior to coaching, Quinn was an NHL defenceman, having played nine seasons in the league with the Maple Leafs, Canucks and Atlanta Flames. Coming out of the junior ranks with the Edmonton Oil Kings, he won a Memorial Cup with the club in 1963. He later won another Memorial Cup as part-owner of the Vancouver Giants in 2007.\nHe was appointed Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) in the 2012 Canadian honours. In 2016, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the IIHF Hall of Fame.\nPlaying career.\nQuinn began his junior career with the Hamilton Tiger Cubs and Hamilton Kilty B's in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). After graduating high school, Quinn accepted a scholarship from Michigan Tech, but was declared ineligible to play by the NCAA because he had already signed his rights to the Detroit Red Wings. He instead joined the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Central Alberta Hockey League (CAHL), helping the club to the 1963 Memorial Cup in his only year with Edmonton, playing alongside fellow future NHL player, coach, and manager Glen Sather.\nQuinn turned pro in 1963–64 and began stints in several minor leagues, including the Eastern Hockey League (EHL), Central Hockey League (CHL) and Western Hockey League (WHL). While playing with the Tulsa Oilers, Quinn was called up by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1968, making his NHL debut. During his rookie season with the Maple Leafs, he is probably best remembered for an open-ice bodycheck on Bobby Orr in the 1969 playoffs against the Boston Bruins that left Orr unconscious and provoked a bench-clearing brawl.\nAfter two seasons with the Maple Leafs, the Vancouver Canucks claimed Quinn in the 1970 NHL Expansion Draft. He played two seasons in Vancouver, before being again left unprotected in the 1972 NHL Expansion Draft, where he was claimed by the Atlanta Flames and served as team captain. Quinn retired prematurely in 1977 after suffering an ankle injury.\nManagement and coaching.\nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nQuinn became an assistant coach for the Philadelphia Flyers in 1977 under Fred Shero, and was named head coach of the Flyers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Maine Mariners, the following season. Quinn returned to the Flyers late that season, however, as head coach of the NHL club (with prior head coach Bob McCammon going back to Maine), and during the 1979–80 NHL season (his first full season with the Flyers) Quinn led the team to a record breaking 35-game unbeaten streak that culminated in a trip to the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were upset by the New York Islanders in six games. Quinn won the Jack Adams Award for his effort. He stayed with the Flyers two more years, but was replaced late in the season during his fourth year.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nQuinn briefly left hockey, but remained in the Philadelphia area to attend law school at Widener University. In 1984, he was named head coach of the Los Angeles Kings and went on to finish his degree at the University of San Diego.\nIn his first season back coaching, Quinn returned the Kings to the playoffs after a two-year absence with a 23-point improvement in the standings, but were swept in the opening round by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers. In December 1986, Quinn signed a contract to become the President and General Manager of the Vancouver Canucks for the 1987–88 NHL season while still under contract with the Kings. Quinn, a lawyer, maintained that the Kings had missed a deadline on an option on his contract, which had a clause allowing him to negotiate with other teams. NHL President John Ziegler suspended Quinn for the rest of the season and barred him from taking over Vancouver's hockey operations until June. Ziegler also barred Quinn from coaching anywhere in the NHL until the 1990–91 season. In Ziegler's view, Quinn's actions created a serious conflict of interest that could only be resolved by having him removed as coach. The Kings tried unsuccessfully to sue the Canucks for tampering.\nVancouver Canucks.\nRestricted from coaching, Quinn joined the Canucks the following season in 1987–88 as President and General Manager. He made his first significant transaction, bringing in future franchise goaltender Kirk McLean from the New Jersey Devils along with forward Greg Adams, for centre Patrik Sundström and the Canucks' 1988 fourth-round draft pick (Matt Ruchty), on September 15, 1987. Quinn continued to make an impact in his first two NHL Entry Drafts, selecting future team captain Trevor Linden second overall in 1988 and Pavel Bure 113th overall in 1989. Linden went on to become the franchise's all-time leading scorer and have his jersey retired by the Canucks. Bure, meanwhile, won the Calder Memorial Trophy as league rookie-of-the-year in his first year and recorded three 50-goal seasons with the Canucks and also had his jersey retired.\nBure's selection was highly controversial, however, as Quinn had seemingly chosen him a year ahead of his eligible draft season. At the age of 18, Bure was available to be chosen in the first three rounds of the draft, but in order to be selected any later than that, he would have had to play in at least two seasons (with a minimum of 11 games per season) for his elite-level European club, the Central Red Army. The Canucks' head scout at the time, Mike Penny, discovered that Bure had played in additional exhibition and international games to make him an eligible late-round draft choice a year early, however. Quinn originally intended to draft Bure in the eighth round, but after receiving word that the Edmonton Oilers had similar intentions, he selected him in the sixth. Team executives reportedly stormed the Met Center stage in Minnesota, where the draft was being held, protesting the choice immediately following its announcement. The league investigated the selection and originally deemed it illegal. Quinn and the Canucks appealed the decision and it was not until the eve of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, in which Bure would have been re-entered, that the draft choice was upheld.\nIn 1991, with the coaching ban lifted, he took over the head coach position with the Canucks for the remaining 26 games of the 1990–91 season. Entering his first full season as Canucks head coach in 1991–92, Quinn met further resistance regarding Bure, who was set to play his rookie season, from the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation. Soviet officials called for Bure's contract with the Central Red Army and the two sides went to court in October 1991 with the Soviets agreeing to a $250,000 settlement. Quinn signed Bure to a four-year contract soon thereafter, on October 31, worth a reported $2.7 million with an $800,000 signing bonus. Quinn went on to win his second Jack Adams Award as a dramatically improved Canucks squad succeeded in winning the Smythe division. The Canucks repeated as division champions the following season in 1992–93 before appearing in the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals against the New York Rangers. Despite a lackluster regular season in which the Canucks finished with the seventh seed in their conference, the team that had been entirely built by Quinn got past the Calgary Flames, Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs in the first three rounds. The Canucks pushed the first-overall Rangers to a seven-game series in the final, but lost the seventh and deciding game.\nFollowing his second Stanley Cup Finals appearance, Quinn gave up his coaching duties to focus on his roles as President and General Manager. In the mid-1990s, the Canucks ownership gradually shifted from the Griffiths family to a new group led by John McCaw Jr. In November 1997, Quinn was fired by the new ownership, with whom Quinn did not see eye-to-eye.\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nBefore the 1998–99 NHL season, Quinn was named head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. In his first season, the Maple Leafs improved dramatically, transitioning from a plodding checking team to a speedy scoring team that reached the conference finals, losing to the Buffalo Sabres. He was named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award, and was given the additional duties of General Manager. Quinn took on the General Manager position, reportedly to preempt Leafs President Ken Dryden from hiring his preferred GM which was former Habs teammate Bob Gainey.\nThree years later, the Maple Leafs made it to the 2002 Conference Finals, but were eliminated by the Carolina Hurricanes. In August 2003, Quinn was replaced as general manager by John Ferguson Jr., who became the league's youngest general manager at 36, but still retained his coaching duties.\nFollowing the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Maple Leafs failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time with Quinn as head coach in 2005–06. As a result, Quinn was fired along with assistant coach and former teammate Rick Ley on April 20, 2006. The Maple Leafs had suffered season-ending injuries from key players Eric Lindros, Jason Allison, Alex Khavanov and Ed Belfour, all of whom had been signed as free agents by Ferguson the preceding off-season. Despite losing all four players to injury, the Maple Leafs finished the season going 9–1–2 with a younger lineup of prospects, many of whom were drafted by Quinn during his tenure as general manager. Aside from Toronto's lack of success, however, it was speculated that the decision to fire Quinn was a result of friction between him and general manager Ferguson (who denied it), as well as a split in the ownership of Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment with Ferguson being backed by MLSE Chairman Larry Tannebaum and with Quinn being supported by Ken Thompson (whose Woodbridge holding company had planned to but never did increase its stake in MLSE). Amid speculation of his firing leading up to the official announcement, team captain Mats Sundin and veteran Darcy Tucker had both pledged support for Quinn through the media. Under Quinn, the Maple Leafs had consistently been contenders, recording three 100-point seasons and making the playoffs every season until his last, despite never advancing past the conference finals.\nInternational.\nAt the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, Quinn coached Team Canada to their first Olympic gold medal since 1952, with a 5–2 victory over Team USA in the gold medal game. He subsequently received a standing ovation from the fans in Montreal for his efforts in his first NHL game back from the Olympics.\nTwo years later, in 2004, Quinn coached Team Canada to victory in the 2004 World Cup with a perfect 6–0 record, capped off by a 3–2 victory over Finland in the final.\nLooking to defend their 2002 Olympic gold medal, Hockey Canada chose Quinn once again to coach Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Despite high expectations, Canada went 3–2 through the preliminary round, losing to Switzerland and Finland, both by 2–0 shutouts, then lost to Russia, again by a 2–0 score, in the quarter-finals.\nWithout an NHL coaching job, having been let go by the Maple Leafs at the end of the 2005–06 season, Quinn was chosen to coach Team Canada at the 2006 Spengler Cup. They made it to the final game against HC Davos, but lost 3–2.\nTwo years later, Quinn turned to junior hockey, serving as head coach for Team Canada in the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships. He led Canada to the finals against Russia, taking the title by an 8–0 score. With established success at the junior international level, Quinn was chosen to coach the Canadian under-20 team for the 2009 World Junior Championships as the host country in Ottawa. He led Canada to an undefeated record in tournament play and a fifth consecutive gold medal, defeating Sweden 5–1 in the final.\nEdmonton Oilers.\nAfter a three-year absence from the NHL, in which he coached for Team Canada's Spengler Cup, under-18 and junior teams, Quinn was named the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers on May 26, 2009, replacing Craig MacTavish. In his first and ultimately only season as head coach of the Oilers, the team finished in last place in the league with a record of 27–47–8.\nPat Quinn was replaced by Tom Renney as head coach on June 22, 2010, being given the title of Senior Adviser of Hockey Operations for the Oilers, a position he left after the 2010-11 season.\nPersonal life.\nQuinn was born in 1943 and grew up in east Hamilton, Ontario. He was a cousin of former professional wrestler \"Big\" John Quinn.\nQuinn graduated with a B.A. in economics in 1972 from York University in Toronto, Ontario, three years after he began his NHL career with the Toronto Maple Leafs. After retiring from his playing career in 1977, Quinn considered law school, but instead accepted a coaching position with the Philadelphia Flyers. Nearly five years later, he was fired by the Flyers in time to take the exam for spring acceptance into law school. Being under contract with the Flyers, his tuition was subsidized by the NHL club. He earned his J.D. degree from the Widener University School of Law, in Delaware.\nQuinn never practiced law, but used his legal knowledge in his executive positions with the Vancouver Canucks and Maple Leafs.\nDeath.\nQuinn died at the Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver on November 23, 2014, following a long battle with illness. He had been unable to attend the 2014 Hockey Hall of Fame induction ceremony on November 17 due to his illness.\nHonours and legacy.\nLegacy.\nQuinn is credited with popularizing the terms \"upper body injury\" and \"lower body injury\" to describe injuries to his players, terms which are now commonplace around the NHL. The term originated during the 1999 Stanley Cup Playoffs when Quinn described an injury sustained to defenceman Dmitri Yushkevich against the Philadelphia Flyers as an \"upper body injury\". Quinn said he came up with the term \"out of the blue\" and said he did so because he was tired of having to talk about injuries (as well as worrying about Yushkevich's safety in a physical series). The NHL allows the descriptors as it does not violate league policy against \"misleading information\" while also maintaining a player's right to privacy over their medical information. Nevertheless, its usage is controversial around the league. In 2018, the Concussion Legacy Foundation stated that the terms provide confusion concerning concussion symptoms, and Ken Hitchcock, then coach of the Dallas Stars, scrapped the practice in favour of specificity because he believed \"(the media) knows what the injury is anyway\". That same year, Leafs head coach Mike Babcock said he would continue to use the descriptors, because he says it allows \"the right people\" to work on the injury without \"(the media) confusing things\", and Washington Capitals forward T. J. Oshie said he prefers the protection because \"there are too many idiots who'd target (the injured area)\" if they knew about the injury.\nQuinn was a member of the committee that determines who is inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2013, he was named the Chairman of the committee.\nMemorials.\nOn June 9, 2005, the city of Hamilton, Ontario, honoured Quinn at a special ceremony at Parkdale Arena, on the corner of Main Street East and Parkdale Avenue North, where the arena was officially renamed the Pat Quinn Parkdale Arena. On June 8, 2006, Quinn returned to his hometown in Hamilton to accept an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from McMaster University. He addressed the convocation of Social Sciences graduates, saying that \"education is a toolbox to make career changes. It is good advice for you to follow your dreams, listen to your heart and obey your passion\".\nOn March 17, 2015, before the NHL game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Vancouver Canucks, the city of Vancouver, British Columbia officially unveiled the new name of the 700-block of Abbott Street located just outside Rogers Arena to \"Pat Quinn Way\".\nIn 2015 Dan Robson wrote a biography on Quinn titled \"Quinn: The Life of a Hockey Legend.\""

Doug Bollinger was relegated to twelfth man.\nDay One: The conditions provided seam and swing for the bowlers and South Africa took full advantage early to have Australia struggling at 38/3. Ponting (83) and Clarke (68) put on 113 for the fourth wicket before Ponting was bowled by a massive in-swinger from Ntini. After Clarke fell with the score on 182, North (47*) and Haddin (37*) took the score to 254/5 from 68 overs, when bad light, and then rain, stopped play for the day.&lt;br&gt;\nDale Steyn was the pick of the bowlers with 3/82 from 19 overs, being both dangerous and economical early.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Two: Haddin and North added 113 for the 5th wicket before the wicket-keeper was caught on 63. Marcus North (117) then continued on to make a century on debut (becoming the 18th Australian to do so, and the first against South Africa.) North and Mitchell Johnson (96*) put on 117 for the 7th wicket (a new record partnership for that wicket against South Africa). Mitchell Johnson later hit 26 from one over from Harris (an Australian Test record) before being stranded on 96 not out when Siddle and Hilfenhaus were dismissed off consecutive deliveries. Australia finished all out for 466.&lt;br&gt;\nSteyn 4/113 and Morkel 3/117 were the pick of the bowlers.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa's response did not start well when Smith (0) and Alma (1) were dismissed with only 2 on the board. They finished the day at 85/3, with McKenzie 35* and de Villiers 13*.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Three: AB de Villiers (104*) and McKenzie (36) were the only batsmen to pass 30 as South Africa were dismissed for 220.&lt;br&gt;\nAll the Australian bowlers used took a wicket with Mitchell 4/25 and Siddle 3/76 the best.&lt;br&gt;\nThe day ended early due to bad light with Australia 51/1 at the close; Hughes 36* and Ponting 1*.&lt;br&gt;\nMorné Morkel took the only wicket.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Four: From 99/1 Australia lost 4 wickets for 5 runs and were dismissed for 207. Hughes with 75 was the only batsman to pass 50. This gave Australia a lead of 453 with a day and almost 2 sessions to play.&lt;br&gt;\nFor South Africa, Kallis and Ntini both took 3 wickets.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa in reply started solidly reaching 178/2 from 55 overs at the close. Smith top-scored with 69.&lt;br&gt;\nJohnson and Hilfenhaus took a wicket each.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Five: South Africa progressed steadily to 206/2 when Amla was dismissed for 57. Wickets then fell steadily with the home team losing 8/85 to be all out for 291 just after tea. Johnson took 4/112, Siddle 3/46, Hilfenhaus 2/68 and McDonald 1/31.\n2nd Test.\nSelections: Australia and South Africa both went into the game with unchanged sides.\nDay One: Australia's openers put on 184 for the first wicket as Phillip Hughes (115) became the fourth youngest Australian to score a Test century. South Africa's bowlers appeared lethargic before striking back later in the day, but not before Katich (108) had scored his 6th Test century. Australia finished the day at 303/4 with Hussey (37*) and North (17*) at the crease. Bad light stopped play an over short.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Two: South Africa's bowlers started the second day in better style and, after a wicketless first hour, found form on a lively pitch to take Australia from 4/329 to be all out for 352. Australia lost 5–4 in 18 deliveries, after Hussey and Steyn has a verbal slanging match mid-pitch. Hussey (50) and North (38) were the only batsmen to score anything over 5 runs for the day. All the bowlers, bar Duminy, took a wicket with Steyn the best with 3/83 from 25.4 overs.&lt;br&gt;\nMitchell Johnson opened the bowling for the visitors and produced one of the best spells of fast, swing bowling seen in some time. He dismissed McKenzie (0) and Alma (0) in his first over, and then struck Graeme Smith on the hand in his second. Smith retired hurt with a broken finger and will take no further part in the match. Johnson later hit Kallis on the chin with a fast bouncer and the South African also retired hurt, though he was to return later in the innings. McDonald took three quick wickets after Tea and South Africa ended an eventful day at 138/7, with Duminy 73* and Steyn 8*.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Three: Peter Siddle opened the bowling on day three and wrapped up the South African first innings in three deliveries. JP Duminy did not face a ball. South Africa were dismissed (with Smith not returning to the crease) for 138, giving Australia a first innings lead of 214. Ponting did not enforce the follow-on, and, in reply, Australia produced another 50-run opening stand before Katich (30) was dismissed with the score on 55. Hughes and Ponting (81) then put on a partnership of 164 before Hughes became the youngest player in history to score centuries in each innings of a Test match. Australia finished the day at 292/3.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Four: Australia pushed for quick runs on the fourth morning and declared at 331/5 with a lead of 545. Hughes was the pick of the batsmen with 160. With that innings Hughes became the youngest cricketer in the history of the game to achieve the milestone of scoring a century in both innings The South African bowlers spread the wickets around with none taking more than one.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa's second innings began well with Alma (43) opening with McKenzie (31) in the absence of Smith. Both were out by the time the score was 82, both dismissed by Siddle. After that, the experienced pair of Kallis (84*) and De Villiers (68*) appeared to be playing a different game as they took the score to 244/2 at the close: an unbroken partnership of 164.&lt;br&gt;\nGoing into the fifth day, Australia require 7 wickets for a 2–0 lead in the series, and South Africa 302 runs for a record-breaking win.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Five: Kallis (93) and De Villiers (84) extended their partnership to 187 before Kallis fell to Johnson. Wickets then fell steadily throughout the day with South Africa losing 8/103 to be all out for 370 (Smith did not bat in the second innings). This gave Australia the win by 175 runs and a series-winning lead of 2–0.&lt;br&gt;\nKatich and Siddle each took three wickets for the visitors.\n3rd Test.\nSelections: In the absence of the injured Smith Jacques Kallis was appointed captain for South Africa. Prince replaced Smith, and Khan replaced McKenzie who had been dropped. Bryce McGain made his Test debut in place of Marcus North who came down with illness.\nDay One: After Ricky Ponting won his sixth toss in a row Australia's openers started slowly, but looked set before Hughes (33) and Ponting (0) were out just before lunch. Hussey (20) and Clarke (0) went soon after and Australia were 4/81. With Katich (55) maintaining one end Haddin (42) and Johnson (35) provided support. Australia were all out for 209.&lt;br&gt;\nOf the South African bowlers Ntini was the best—and most unlucky—early before Harris and Steyn broke through. Ntini finished with two wickets, which could easily have been five if catches had been held and inside edges had hit the stumps.&lt;br&gt;\nIn reply South Africa seemed relatively untroubled with the new opening pair of Prince (37*) and Khan (15*) reaching 57/0 at the close.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Two: South Africa lost Khan (20) early on day two but were hardly pressed after that. Prince (150) continued his good domestic form but Alma (46) fell again when seemingly set. Kallis scored his 31st Test century to be 102*, with de Villiers 39*, and South Africa 404/3 at stumps.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Australian bowlers looked tired and listless in the face of sustained batting with McGain taking a lot of punishment.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Three: Kallis went for his overnight score, and Duminy and Boucher also went cheaply and South Africa were 467/6. De Villers and Morkel (58) added 124 for the 7th wicket, before South Africa were all out for 651, a lead of 442 on the first innings. De Villiers scored freely throughout the day to reach 163 before being caught on the fence. He was particularly harsh on McGain and McDonald taking 25 from one over from the second of these.&lt;br&gt;\nJohnson finished with 4/138 and Katich 2/9 from 3 overs.&lt;br&gt;\nBatting a second time Australia ended the day at 102/2, with a very hard fight ahead of them to save the match.&lt;br&gt;\nDay Four: Wickets fell steady during the day until Australia reached 6/218. Johnson (123*) and McDonald (68) then put on 163 for the 7th wicket to get Australia to within sight of making South Africa bat again. Paul Harris cleaned up the tail and Australia had lost by an innings for only the second time against South Africa, and for the first time in any Test match in over a decade. Harris finished with 6/127, and with his 3/34 in the first innings, was named Man of the Match. Johnson scored his maiden Test century off only 86 deliveries."

        "text": "Earl Weaver Baseball II is a sports video game for MS-DOS compatible operating systems published by Electronic Arts in 1991. It is the sequel to the 1987 game \"Earl Weaver Baseball\".\nGameplay.\n\"Earl Weaver Baseball II \" is the sequel to the 1987 original with many improvements, including the first full 3D camera that would render a television-style viewing experience. This was made possible by a design decision Dombrower made at Mattel to use a 3D model of the game from the get-go in anticipation of this eventuality. However, the game was released prematurely by Electronic Arts, and Version 1.1, which fixed many of the small bugs that ruined some of its reputation, was never released. In 1992, a version of EWB2 was developed in conjunction with STATS, Inc., that would play back real baseball games using the EWB II display engine and live scoring information from each ballpark, but it was never finished or released. It was only released for MS-DOS.\nReception.\nPeter Scisco for \"Compute!\" said \"a brighter spring training for all PC baseball players.\"\nJoseph McCullough for \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" said \"In all, \"Earl Weaver II\" does not live up to its pre-release hype. Instead of being a revolutionary rewrite with vastly improved graphics, statistics and manager options, \"Earl Weaver II\" is simply a mildly improved version of \"Weaver 1.5\".\"\n\"Computer Gaming World\" said \"In short, \"Earl Weaver Baseball II\" is not simply an upgrade, it is a complete redesign. It offers something new and improved for both casual and dedicated gamers, both statistical buffs and action fanatics. \"Earl Weaver Baseball II\" is a definite contender.\"\n\"Computer Gaming World\" in 1991 denounced \"Earl Weaver Baseball II\" as \"herky-jerky, funhouse-mirror baseball ... a field-of-nightmares experience\". The magazine stated that the sequel had ruined the original's attractive ballparks with \"cancerous growths of looming grandstands\", less information was available when planning strategy, the automated camera director was poorly implemented, and many features in the original game were now on the optional Commissioner's Disk. Bugs included assigning Connie Mack and John McGraw to the wrong leagues and a conversion utility for player disks that failed on an Electronic Arts-produced disk from 1990."

        "title": "World Series of Football (1902–03)",
        "text": "The World Series of Football was a series of football games played indoors at New York City's Madison Square Garden in 1902 and 1903. It originally comprised five teams, four from the state of New York and one from New Jersey. While none of the teams were really considered the best in the country, historians refer to the affair as a \"World Series\". However, it was hardly a series in the sense of two strong teams playing each other over several games. In fact, no team played another more than once and the team pairings were also considered odd. Under the 1902 system, the anticipated second-place team was automatically swept into the championship game without even playing a down while the expected first-place finisher had to fight its way through the brackets, effectively creating a cross between a traditional tournament and a \"gauntlet-style\" tournament for the first-place team.\nThe series is best remembered for showcasing the first indoor professional football game in 1902.\n1902 series.\nThe event was the idea of Tom O'Rourke, who was the manager of the Gardens at the time. He needed an event to draw people to the Gardens in late December, which was a slow time of the year for sporting events. Basketball and hockey were not yet major sports in New York, so O'Rourke decided to play to host a series of indoor football games. He decided to invite several professional and college teams to the Gardens for the series. Tom O'Rourke envisioned a series of games, showcasing the best in college and pro teams, eventually leading to one climactic game, crowning the \"champion of the world.\"\nFinding teams.\nO'Rourke had a tough time finding teams to play in the tournament. The colleges refused due to increased pressure from the Amateur Athletic Association to stop participating in professional games. Also the Pittsburgh Stars, Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Athletics, along with the first National Football League, had all disbanded. The Watertown Red and Blacks, who were the top team in New York state at the time (and one of the few teams of the era that still exists today) also refused the series. For reasons not fully known, the best team in the nascent Ohio League, the Akron East Ends, were not invited. This left four teams to compete in the tournament: the Syracuse Athletic Club, the Knickerbocker Athletic Club, the Warslow Athletic Club and the Orange Athletic Club. O'Rourke did finally get a fifth team to join the series when some players from the Phillies and Athletics got together and formed was called the \"New York\" team. In calling them the \"New York\" team, O'Rourke expected to give his patrons the pleasure of watching a \"home team\" win. The team was made up of eight Phillies and four Athletics that included A's coach Charles \"Blondy\" Wallace and Phillies coach Ben Roller.\nThe field.\nMadison Square Garden had to be redone to accommodate the teams. The wooden flooring of the arena was removed and replaced by an earthen surface. During the event the goal lines were only 70 yards apart and the playing field was only 35 yards wide. The earthen surface also became sticky as the game progressed and made for some tough maneuvering, while the stands were right up to the playing field and proved to be a physical hazard. The kicking game was also drastically affected. In a game on a normal field the team with the longest punts had the advantage. However, the Gardens proved to be a dream for a weak punter due to the field size. The arena wall was right on the edge of the field, presenting a serious hazard for any sideline plays. One player reportedly knocked himself out of the tournament by running into the wall on the opening kickoff.\nOutcome.\nThe tournament was scheduled to last three nights starting on December 29 and ending on New Year's Eve. O'Rourke scheduled his tournament by considering the expected strengths of the teams. On opening night he scheduled the \"New York\" team against Syracuse. By defeating Syracuse the \"New York\" team, O'Rouke hoped, would defeat the team that would probably bring the fewest fans into the Garden. Then on the second night the Knickerbockers and Warlow would play to determine which team would be beaten by the \"New York\" team in the series third game. O'Rourke anticipated this game as having the best attendance of the tournament. Finally the fourth game, by holding out the Orange Athletic Club until the end, he predicted a New York versus New Jersey match-up in which New Jersey would lose a close game to one of the three New York teams.\nHowever, O'Rourke did not realize how seriously the Syracuse team would take the tournament. Prior to the start of the series Syracuse signed three running backs from Watertown, along with Bemus and Hawley Pierce from the Carlisle Indian School and Bill Warner and his brother Glenn. The team was put together by Frank \"Buck\" O'Neill who conducted daily practices in preparation for the series.\nSyracuse defeated \"New York\" in what has been called the first indoor pro football game. The final score of the game was recorded as 6–0, but in reality it was 5–0 since touchdowns only counted for five points in 1902 and Pop Warner missed the extra point. Warner later suffered a head injury and was replaced by Blondy Wallace from the \"New York\" team later in the series. The Knickerbockers defeated Warlow the next night 11–6. Syracuse defeated the Knickerbockers 36–0 on New Year's Eve. The finale on New Year's night against Orange resulted in another 36–0 win, and the series championship, for Syracuse.\n1903 series.\nO'Rourke planned another series for 1903. This year he planned a round-robin tournament of the top football clubs in the area, a high school all-star game, bicycle races, and a Gaelic football match. The end result would be fifteen football games during a span of six days at the Garden. The 1903 attendees included Oreos Athletic Club from Asbury Park, New Jersey; the returning Orange Athletic Club; and the Franklin Athletic Club from Pennsylvania. The Watertown Red and Black, which refused entry into the tournament in 1902, put up $2000 in prize money ($1,250 for first place, $750 for second). Syracuse was offered a chance to defend their title but declined. Blondy Wallace also returned to the series, this time as a member of the Franklin team.\nThe playing surface of the Gardens for the 1903 series was still 70 yards. However, the surface itself was also improved upon. Dirt was trucked into the Gardens and steamrolled into a more natural surface.\nResults.\nOn December 14, 1903, the Olympic Athletic Club defeated Knickerbocker Athletic Club 6–0. For that night's second game the Watertown Red and Black defeated the Oreo Athletic Club by a score of 5–0. The game's only score came on a controversial touchdown call, by the referee, in the second half of the game. Fighting and rioting soon broke out between the Oreos and Watertown fans, before being contained by the New York Police Department. In other games the Franklin defeated Orange 12–0 on December 15, Orange defeated the Oreos 22–0 on December 18 and Watertown defeated Orange 11–0 on December 19.\nFranklin and Watertown became the two top teams for the 1903 series. Watertown narrowly won the opening game against Oreo by a score of 6–0. While Franklin came out the victor against Orange 16–0 amid various calls of rough play and fighting. Two nights later Franklin and Watertown featured in the championship game. Many Watertown fans bet between $100 and $500 a clip on their team. However Franklin won the game 12–0. With that win Franklin's betters brought home over $4,000 in winnings. According to Dr. Harry March's often inaccurate book \"\", Frank Hinkey was a referee at the event. March states the officials during the series \"were dressed in full evening dress, from top hats down to white gloves and patent leather shoes.\" During the last play of the series between Franklin and Watertown, the Franklin players knew they had the game in hand. As a result, the Franklin backfield agreed to run over the clean and sharply dressed Hinkley, purposely in jest, knocking him into the dirt. Hinkley took the incident in good nature and Franklin's management agreed to pay his cleaning bill.\nLegacy.\nO'Rourke canceled the event after the 1903 series. He was largely disappointed by the lack of attendance at the series. The largest crowd over six days was only 2,500, which was for a high school football game. Today the uniform worn from Harry Mason from the Syracuse Athletic Club is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Orange Athletic Club would evolve into the Orange Tornadoes (and later Newark Tornadoes) of the National Football League in 1929 and 1930. Through a series of changing leagues and revivals, the franchise was shuttered after the 1970 season, ending its life as the Orlando Panthers of the Atlantic Coast Football League. The Watertown Red &amp; Black still exists today as members of the Empire Football League."

He won four caps for Wales, all in 1914.\nRugby career.\nWatts came to prominence in Welsh rugby when he was part of the Maesteg team that won the Glamorgan Challenge Cup in 1912. In 1914 Watts was selected to represent Wales as part of the Five Nations Championship. His first game was on the 17 January in a game against England at Twickenham. Under the captaincy of Jenkin Alban Davies, Wales lost the opening game but won the final three games of the tournament. Of all Watts' matches, the most notable was the final game at the Balmoral Showgrounds against Ireland. The game was an overly violent affair, after members of both packs ran into each other the night before the game. The Welsh pack, of which Watts was part of, was named the 'Terrible Eight' by newspapers after the game. Watts played one final game for his country, in an exhibition game against the Barbarians in 1915. Again led by Alban Davies, Watts turned out in the match played to boost recruitment for the Welsh Guards, though the game is not recognised as a full international.\nThe game against Ireland was the final Welsh international game before the outbreak of World War I. During the war Watts joined the King's Shropshire Light Infantry as part of the 7th Battalion, reaching the rank of corporal. He was killed in action at Bazentin Ridge in France in 1916.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Gracemount Edinburgh Handball Club",
        "text": "Gracemount Edinburgh Handball Club was formed in 2002 by Fred Wallace as part of the rebirth of the Scottish Handball Association. In the beginning, the club started with about ten 11- to 13-year-old children training once a week, learning basic ball control skills. Over the next 6 years though, the club has expanded hugely and now boasts a sizeable youth team and a large senior men's team.\nThe club has operated out of numerous venues in the southside of Edinburgh. In the beginning, the local leisure centre at Gracemount was used but as the club expanded there was a need for more regular training sessions and better facilities. Since 2005, GEHC have been training at high schools at Liberton and Gracemount, both with new sports facilities available.\nFrom 2006 onwards, GEHC has seen a large influx of foreign students joining the team while studying in Edinburgh. These students, mainly from mainland Europe have had previous experience with Handball as it is a professional sport on the continent. Due to this, the less experienced Scottish players have been learning from a vast pool of experience and improving rapidly.\nEarly years.\nFor the first 3 years of Gracemount's existence, the club was solely focused on Youth development. Over the course of those 3 years, Gracemount took teams to the Partille Cup in Sweden. Results became gradually better over the years, but due to the scale of the sport in other countries, Gracemount lost most of their games to strong European teams. Despite this, the experience was extremely valuable as the young players were introduced to different styles of play and were able to witness handball played by experienced teams.\nIn 2004, many of the older Gracemount players were selected to represent the Scotland U-16 squad, and played games against England, Ireland and a German regional team. The Gracemount players in the squad were very influential in the Scotland U-16 squad's victory over Ireland in the Liverpool Tri-Nations Tournament.\n2005 – present.\nSince 2005, Gracemount have been competing in the Scottish Senior Men's League. At first, Gracemount's youth players made up much of the team and played against Men's teams like Tryst 77 and Glasgow. Over the last 2 years though, Gracemount has seen a large influx of older players which has allowed the club to expand rapidly. 2007/08 proved to be a promising season for the club, with the high point being a very credible performance against Great Dane HC, widely recognised as the best Handball Club in Britain.\n2008 has seen the club expand even more, with 25-30 men training regularly. This allowed Gracemount to enter 2 teams into the Scottish league, with 1 team focused on mounting a title challenge while the 2nd team worked on development for the younger or less experienced players. This proved to be a success for Gracemount. The first team missed out on the Pre-Xmas title with a 29–28 loss to Glasgow HC. A win by 1 goal would have secured the title for Gracemount, but finishing second in the league ahead of defending champions Tryst 77 HC is still considered the club's greatest achievement to date. Gracemount's second team in the league also put in some promising performances, showing very clearly that they were not at all far behind the other teams in the league.\nThe season 2009/10 became the season where the club achieved its goal of winning the Scottish Senior Men's League by winning 11 of 12 games and drawing one game 32–32 to Glasgow HC. The final game against Cumbernauld HC saw a fairly amputated Gracemount team, that due to the Icelandic Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption, had some players stuck in their native countries. However, the team managed to win 41–38 against Cumbernauld HC. The next goal is to win the Scottish Cup 2009/10.\nWorld Class Handball Program.\nOver recent years, the British Handball Association have been sending British handball players to Denmark to train with the World Class Handball Program in preparation for the London 2012 Olympics. Many Scottish players are involved in this process, including 1 Gracemount player, Taylor Hoven. Alan Stokes spent 3 years training in Denmark and playing for Danish club Braband in preparation for 2012. Taylor Hoven is part of the 2016 Olympic Program."

Born in Solon, Maine, he threw right-handed, batted left-handed, and was listed as tall and .\nWashburn's Organized Baseball tenure stretched from 1935 to 1952, and included the war years of 1942–1945. He debuted in the Yankees' farm system and by 1938 he was pitching at the top level of the minor leagues. In 1940, he won 18 games, losing eight, for the Newark Bears of the International League. The following season, at age 26, he made what would be his lone MLB appearance. \nOn Sunday, May 4, Washburn took the ball from manager Joe McCarthy as the starting pitcher against the defending American League champion Detroit Tigers at Briggs Stadium. He retired Detroit in order in the first inning—getting Baseball Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer on a ground ball to first base. Staked to a 1–0 lead by a Charlie Keller home run, Washburn unraveled in the second inning. He walked four men, including Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg, threw a wild pitch, and surrendered three runs, all earned. He remained in the game, however, and, batting in the top of the third inning, he struck out against Bobo Newsom in what would be his only MLB at bat. Then, in the bottom of the third, Washburn gave up a leadoff triple to Barney McCosky and walked Gehringer. He was relieved by Marv Breuer with none out and the Yankees trailing 3–1. Breuer struck out both Rudy York and Greenberg, but gave up an unearned tally when McCosky scored on a two-out error by Phil Rizzuto. \nThat closed the book on Washburn's major-league pitching career. In two-plus innings pitched, he allowed only two hits but five bases on balls, three earned runs and a wild pitch, striking out one. He was charged with the Yanks' eventual 10–1 defeat for his one big-league decision. Washburn returned to Newark for the balance of 1941, then played another 11 seasons. Sent to the high-level New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association in 1944, he found a home in Louisiana, eventually spending almost six full seasons in the lower-level Evangeline League as a player-manager, appearing as a first baseman and outfielder as well as taking on mound duties.\nHe died in Baton Rouge on January 5, 1979, aged 64."

Thomas was failed to be selected for the entire 1931 Championship, but during that time was amongst the Swansea team that faced the touring South Africans.\nThomas was not selected for the Welsh international against the Springboks, but represented his country for all three games of the 1932 Home Nations Championship before sporadic appearances over the next two years that saw only two caps.

        "text": "In 2008, for the first time in ten years, two Grand Tours were won by one rider, the Spaniard Alberto Contador. Alessandro Ballan succeeded fellow Italian Paolo Bettini as World Champion, winning the road race in his home country, where Varese hosted the World Championships for the second time in history. Bettini and German sprinter Erik Zabel were among the most prominent riders to quit after this season, while Mario Cipollini made a brief comeback in the early months of the year.\nDespite even tighter controls and warnings concerning doping, and the introduction of the blood passport by the UCI, several major races, including the Giro and Tour were faced with positive tests. In addition, the ongoing feud between the UCI and the race organizations almost came to a definite break in March, when the UCI threatened to suspend riders participating in ASO's Paris–Nice. The cycling federation's ProTour seemed bankrupt halfway through the year when all remaining licensed teams announced their withdrawal. However, at the start of 2009, 16 teams saw their ProTour license renewed and two new teams joined the elite division of cycling. Crédit Agricole and Gerolsteiner stopped sponsorship of a team, and were not succeeded by new sponsors. Other than Gerolsteiner, many German companies who participated in cycling sponsorship in recent years withdrew their financial backing after this year's latest of doping cases related to German cycling. As a result, fewer professional teams and races, among them the Deutschland Tour, will be part of the 2009 season.\nAmongst professional riders, Mark Cavendish was the most successful with 17 victories, including 4 in the Tour de France and two in the Giro d'Italia. His team, Team High Road (which got a new sponsor midway through the season, ever since going by the name Team Columbia), was by far the most successful with 77 victories. Alejandro Valverde was the most successful allround rider of the year based on the CQ ranking.\nAfter the end of the season, seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong announced his comeback to competitive road cycling for 2009, with the Astana Team."

In early 1893, the two men gained a controlling interest in Pittsburgh's National League club, the Pirates, which had absorbed and merged ownership with the defunct Players' League club, when they and manager Al Buckenberger bought out the stock of William Chase Temple. Kerr and Auten sold their majority share of the Pirates to Barney Dreyfuss prior to the 1901 season.\nKerr was known throughout the organization for his short temper. He changed managers frequently during his tenure with the Pirates. It was reported that after the 1896 season, in which the team posted a 66–63 record, team manager Connie Mack left the Pirates due to Kerr's frequent outbursts.\nPersonal life.\nKerr's father, also named William, was a physician and the 14th Mayor of Pittsburgh; his mother was from Philadelphia. Kerr began his business career with Standard Oil in Philadelphia, until taking a position with Arbuckles &amp; Co., a coffee and grocery wholesaler, in Pittsburgh in 1876. Kerr's sister, Alice, was married to a member of the Arbuckle family. Kerr stayed with Arbuckles &amp; Co. for 41 years. He married Martha Ellen Bruce of Pittsburgh in 1882; the couple had three sons. Kerr died in February 1917 at his home, following a brief illness."

        "title": "Rugby union in Victoria",
        "text": "Rugby union in Victoria describes the sport of rugby union being played and watched in the state of Victoria in Australia. The code was first introduced some time between the 1850s and 1880s but remained a minor sport played primarily in the private schools and amongst interstate expats. This has changed, particularly since the professionalisation of the game in the mid 1990s.\nPlayer numbers are healthy for a sport in perhaps the most crowded football code marketplace on earth. Rugby Victoria counts participation across all variations of the game including 15-a-side Rugby, Sevens Rugby, VIVA 7s and Game-On primary school development program and claims that the game has grown by 38 per cent in 2016 to 15,829 participants. However Ausplay shows a decline of the sport in Victoria and with 11,792 registered players in 2022 trails behind Rugby union in Western Australia. \nThere are over 25 Rugby clubs in Victoria at any one time, with age group and community rugby forming the largest portion. The top tier of clubs consisting of a mix of amateurs and professionally contracted players aligned with the Melbourne Rebels compete for the Dewar Shield.\nVictoria has produced over 30 Wallabies and many more Super Rugby and Professional players and age group Australian players as well as internationals for a number of pacific island nations.\nInternational rugby matches are popular with spectators in Victoria. This is evidenced by the large crowds which attended matches at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, 2006 Commonwealth Games, England v Australia game (2016) and overall television ratings for blockbuster internationals.\nVictoria is represented in the professional Super Rugby competition by the Melbourne Rebels.\nHistory.\nWriter Sean Fagan claims that Rugby football was first played in Victoria in the late 1840s and into the 1850s. While it is not known specifically which rules they played, the earliest recorded football clubs in Victoria, St Kilda Football Club (1858), South Yarra (1858), Scotch College, Melbourne, Melbourne Grammar and St Kilda Grammar did not originally play Australian rules football and are believed to have played English school games, quite possibly rugby. However, dissatisfaction with a lack of uniform rules and how the game was played led to the Melbourne FC in May 1859 adopting its own revised laws of football which was later to become known as Australian rules football. With the rapid rise in popularity of Australian rules football in Victoria, rugby quickly became a minority sport.\nDuring the 1870s, Victorian clubs Albert Park and South Melbourne continued to experiment with rugby football rules. In May 1874, Albert Park, South Melbourne, and others had advocated strongly for their widespread adoption in Victoria, however this did not meet favour with the more powerful clubs in the colony and the premier football matches, the Challenge Cup effectively banned use of the rugby rules by competing clubs.\nEarly intercolonials between Victoria and New South Wales were played in alternating codes. During the 1877 match between Waratah and Carlton, Victorian superstar George Coulthard switched codes and joined the Waratahs to play rugby in Sydney. He quickly dominated at the sport, scoring all five goals and four tries in his second and last game for the club. Although he appeared in only two of the Waratahs' twelve rugby matches in 1877, Coulthard scored more goals than any other member that season, and tied equal first in tries. Coulthard's effort in \"[showing] the Rugby men how their game should be played\" damaged the reputation of the rugby code in Victoria for decades.\nClub rugby was established in Victoria when the Melbourne Rugby Union (MRU) was formed in 1888. The touring 1888 British team played matches in Victoria, as did the 1888–89 New Zealand Native team, and both teams switched between rugby and Victorian rules (Australian rules football).\nVictorian rugby went into recess between 1890 due to a lack of players. However competition restarted in 1893.\nVictoria first played rugby football against New South Wales in Melbourne in 1894 and sent its first team to play in Sydney in 1895 but after 1889 the game more or less disappeared in the state except for the match played in Melbourne in 1899 against Great Britain in which the tourists defeated the Victorians 30-0.\nA Victorian Rugby Union (VRU) was restored in 1908 as arrangements were being made for a Victorian team to play the first Wallabies in Melbourne just prior to their departure for Great Britain. \nThe next year, 1909 saw the first presentation of the Dewar Shield, an award for first grade premiership teams still retained. The clubs competing for the inaugural shield were the Melbourne Rugby Union Football Club and Melbourne University Rugby Football Club (both laying claim to being the oldest in Victoria), East Melbourne, South Melbourne.\nCompetition lapsed on commencement of the First World War and was not revived until 1926 when five League clubs decided to convert to Union and form the current VRU. During the following twelve years, up until the Second World War, Victoria played thirty matches against international and interstate teams and produced thirteen Wallabies. Club and representative competition did not resume again until 1946.\nThe first schoolboys match in Victoria was played in 1932 between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar.\nMelbourne was selected as a venue for the 2003 Rugby World Cup including finals. The attendances were significant, with the highlights being 50,647 seeing defeat and 50,647 for versus .\nFollowing the success of the Rugby World Cup, in 2004, the Victorian Rugby Union made a bid for a Super Rugby rugby union franchise. The bid had support from backers including the Victorian Government. However it was rejected by the Australian Rugby Union for a team in Perth which became the Western Force.\nMelbourne hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which included a component of Rugby Sevens, of which all of the matches were sold out. Melbourne holds the current record attendance for Rugby Sevens.\nThe inaugural Australian Rugby Championship started August 2007, including eight teams, one of which based in Melbourne, Victoria. It was rumoured that the New South Wales Rugby Union (NSWRU) gave up a fourth club to enable Victoria to participate in the new national competition. and the Melbourne Rebels were created and played out of Olympic Park Stadium. Despite having one of the larger crowd averages in the competition, they finished their first season with a home crowd average of just 3,305 and the league folded with losses in the millions, with the ARU openly blaming the Victorian franchise's larger costs of operation for the failure. The move was a great setback for the Victorian Rugby Union.\nOn 5 January 2010, it was announced by the Australian Rugby Union that it had awarded control of the new Melbourne Super Rugby team to the Melbourne Rebels consortium and that Melbourne would join the game's elite when the world's premier provincial competition expanded to 15 teams in 2011. The Melbourne Rebels played their first match of Super Rugby at AAMI Park against the NSW Waratahs on 18 February 2011, losing 43-0. The team only had to wait another week before registering their first victory, claiming a thrilling 25-24 win against the ACT Brumbies at AAMI Park in Round 2.\nOn 24 March 2014, the ARU officially announced a new professional national competition, the National Rugby Championship. The inaugural season started in August 2014. Victoria is represented by the Melbourne Rising, which plays out of AAMI Park.\nGoverning body.\nKnown as the Victorian Rugby Union until late 2017, the governing body for rugby union in the state of Victoria is now Rugby Victoria. Victoria is a founding member of the national governing body, Rugby Australia.\nClubs.\nThese clubs in turn feed the Victorian state representative team, The Victorian Country (pre 2008), the Rebel Rising, a joint program between the Victorian Rugby Union and the Melbourne Rebels established in 2011.\nNotable players.\nVictoria has produced a number of top-level rugby players including\nNotable coaches.\nVictoria has had a number of outstanding and successful rugby coaches including"

The Hardy Cup was named for W. G. Hardy, and it was retired to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990.\nHistory.\nThe Canadian Amateur Hockey Association established the W. G. Hardy Trophy in 1968, which became known as the Hardy Cup. It was awarded to the national champion of the intermediate senior division. From 1984 onward, the trophy was awarded to the Senior AA division champions of Canada, after senior and intermediate hockey were merged. The trophy was donated by a group of realtors from North Battleford, and retired from competition in 1990.\nUntil the 1967-68 season, the Intermediate level had many regional championships. The most prominent was for the Edmonton Journal Trophy, the Western Canadian Intermediate \"A\" Crown. In Ontario, the Intermediate champions were sometimes included in Allan Cup Senior \"A\" playoffs. Senior \"AA\" was unsustainable at the national level and the trophy was retired soon after.\nChampionships by location.\nThis is a list of champions by province, territory, or state.

Prior to that, he was a minor league general manager for four years and was named the 1979 Northwest League Executive of the Year while serving as general manager of the Eugene Emeralds. From 1982 to 1985, he served as assistant director of scouting and player development for the Royals, and while in that position he was credited with researching and developing the basis of the Royals successful protest involving the controversial Pine Tar Incident between the Royals and the New York Yankees on July 24, 1983. Following the Royals World Championship season in 1985, he was promoted to assistant to the general manager under general manager John Schuerholz, and he worked in that position until early 1990 when he joined the Major League Baseball Commissioner's Office as manager of baseball operations.\nPrior to the 1991 season, Taylor was hired as assistant general manager of the Atlanta Braves under Schuerholz and contributed to eight consecutive National League Eastern Division titles and the 1995 World Series Championship. On September 21, 1999, he was hired as the senior vice president of baseball operations and general manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, a position he held until September 2002, when he was replaced by Doug Melvin. He spent the 2003 season as a consultant for the Los Angeles Dodgers before being named as assistant general manager of the Cincinnati Reds in December of that year.\nTaylor returned to the Kansas City Royals in June 2006 as vice president of baseball operations and assistant general manager and contributed to the resurgence of the franchise over the next nine seasons. The Royals announced his retirement from baseball in January 2015, but he continued to serve the Royals as a consultant through the conclusion of the team's 2015 World Championship season, which marked his 40th year in baseball. \nDuring his major league front office career, Taylor was associated with five League Championship teams and three World Championship teams. He was a member of the MLB Safety and Health Advisory Committee and served as chairman of the MLB Rules and Administration Committee during his tenure as the Brewers' general manager.\nTaylor graduated from Mercersburg Academy in 1969 and Claremont McKenna College in 1973.

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle was a swimming event held as part of the swimming at the 1936 Summer Olympics programme. It was the ninth appearance of the event, which had not been featured only at the 1900 Games. The competition was held on Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 9 August 1936. Forty-five swimmers from 23 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three swimmers each since the 1924 Games. The event was won by Ferenc Csik of Hungary, the nation's first victory in the event since 1904 and third overall (second all-time behind the United States with 5). For the second consecutive Games, Japan took two medals in the 100 metre freestyle, this time silver (Masanori Yusa) and bronze (Shigeo Arai). The United States' seven-Games medal streak in the event ended as the nation's best result was sixth place by Peter Fick.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nNone of the six finalists from 1932 returned. American Peter Fick, the world record holder, was a slight favorite. The Japanese team was strong once again. European champion Ferenc Csik of Hungary was considered a tier below the Americans and Japanese.\nBermuda, Bolivia, the Republic of China, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, and Peru each made their debut in the event. The United States made its ninth appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition used a three-round (quarterfinals, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule was a modification of the one used since 1912, allowing the top swimmers in each race plus one or more wild cards to advance. For this event, the top two in each preliminary heat plus the next two fastest swimmers would advance to the semifinals; the top three in each semifinal plus the fastest fourth-place swimmer would move on to the final. There were 7 heats of between 6 and 8 swimmers, allowing 16 swimmers to advance to the semifinals. The 2 semifinals had 8 swimmers each; 7 advanced to the final.\nEach race involved two lengths of the 50-metre pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nPeter Fick set a new Olympic record in the first heat with 57.6 seconds. In the fifth heat Masaharu Taguchi bettered the Olympic record with 57.5 seconds. Masanori Yusa equalized this record in the second semifinal with 57.5 seconds.\nResults.\nHeats.\nSaturday 8 August 1936: The fastest two in each heat and the next two fastest from across the heats advanced to the semi-finals.\nSemifinals.\nSaturday 8 August 1936: The fastest three in each semi-final and the fastest fourth-placed from across the heats advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nSunday 9 August 1936:"

        "text": "The 1980 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament was the culmination of the 1979–80 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, the 33rd such tournament in NCAA history. It was held between March 22 and 29, 1980, and concluded with North Dakota defeating Northern Michigan 5–2. The first-round game was held at the home team venue while all succeeding games were played at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nQualifying teams.\nThe NCAA gave four teams automatic bids into the tournament. The two ECAC teams that reached the ECAC tournament final received bids as did the two WCHA co-champions. The NCAA also had the ability to add up to 4 additional teams as it saw fit and chose to include the CCHA tournament champion as well.\nFormat.\nThe four automatic qualifiers were seeded according to pre-tournament finish. The ECAC champion was seeded as the top eastern team while the WCHA co-champion that finished highest in the regular season was given the top western seed. The second eastern seed was slotted to play the top western seed and vice versa. Because an at-large bid was offered to a western school they were placed in a first-round game with the second western seed to determine the final semifinalist. The first-round game was played at the home venue of the second seed while all succeeding games were played at the Providence Civic Center. All matches were Single-game eliminations with the semifinal winners advancing to the national championship game and the losers playing in a consolation game."

ASRA is expanding and hoping to build an extension to the current boathouse which was constructed in 2001. This is due to the huge increase in members due to the success of the \"Wet Start\" and \"Dry Start\" schemes.\nASRA is run by 3 trustees: Bryan Steel, Alan Lawrie and Ian Duncan. They oversee the running of the club and take up roles as Rowing Co-ordinator, Treasurer and Senior Coach respectively. ASRA FP Colin Wallace was the first full-time paid coach and was employed by ASRA from 2007 to 2012. When Colin moved off to Edinburgh to train as a PE teacher, he was replaced by Sportscotland appointee, Jonny Muir, whose daunting remit it is, firstly to encourage more of ASRA's top rowers to follow the GB pathway, secondly to increase participation at all age levels in the club and thirdly to try to cut back the high levels of drop-out in the first years of rowing.\nASRA athletes Miles Beeson and Robert Powell were selected to compete for Great Britain in the 2- event at the 2018 World Rowing Junior Championships in Račice, Czech Republic and ranked 7th overall by winning the B Final. In 2019, the feat was repeated in the Women's 2- at the 2019 World Rowing Junior Championships in Tokyo Bay, Japan by ASRA athletes Abagail Topp and Megan Hewison."

The qualification and final rounds took place on September 17 and 21 at the Sydney SuperDome.\nWorld all-around silver medalist Viktoria Karpenko led the competition until the last rotation, but was thrown from first place after she stubbed her toe, tripped, and fell out of bounds on floor exercise.\nThe all-around competition in the discipline of women's artistic gymnastics (WAG) was marred by three separate scandals.\nThe vault apparatus was set incorrectly for more than half of the meet, and consequently many gymnasts fell and/or were injured on the event. Officials blamed the series of falls and low scores on performance anxiety. It wasn't until Australian gymnast Allana Slater and her coach, Peggy Liddick, voiced concerns about the equipment that officials discovered the apparatus was five centimetres, or almost two inches, lower than it should've been. While athletes were given the opportunity to perform again, for some of them, the damage to their mental or physical health caused by the vault was irreparable. Chinese gymnast Kui Yuanyuan and American gymnast Kristen Maloney both injured their legs while attempting to stick their landings, with Kui needing to be carried to an examination area and Maloney damaging a titanium rod that had recently been implanted in her shin. Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan ultimately took gold while her teammates, Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru took silver and bronze, respectively. This is the second all-around title won by a Romanian after Nadia Comăneci.\nAndreea Răducan, who initially won the event, had her medal stripped after testing positive for pseudoephedrine, which was in a medication given to her by the team doctor. Raducan appealed the disqualification because she did not take the substance knowingly, nor was she responsible for the error; the IOC admitted Raducan was not at fault, but nonetheless upheld the decision, citing a strict liability standard.\nFinally, Dong Fangxiao was found in 2010 to have been 14 years old, two years under the minimum age to compete, at the Sydney Olympics. Consequently, all of her results from the Olympics were deleted from the records.\nResults.\nQualification.\nSixty-four gymnasts competed in the all-around during the qualification round on September 17. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 21. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final.\nFinal.\n1 Annika Reeder was forced to withdraw after being injured on the faulty vaulting horse.\n2 Răducan originally won the event, but was disqualified after testing positive for pseudoephedrine.\n3 Dong Fongxiao originally finished 25th, but was disqualified in 2010 after the IGF discovered she was 14 (and thus under the minimum age to compete) during the Olympics."

        "text": "Arthur Edward Joseph Tonkin (19 October 1922 – c. 1991) was an Australia national representative rugby union footballer who featured in the 1947–48 Wallaby tour of the British Isles.\nEarly life.\nTonkin's father was one of the pioneers of the New South Wales Country Rugby League but made no attempt to influence his three children on which sports they should play. Arthur went to Wagga Wagga Christian Brothers' and later to St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill where he benefited under Brother Henry, the College's legendary coach of the 1930s. He won the GPS Schools sprint championship in 1942 and was an army sprint champion during his wartime service. He was a gunner in the AIF who saw three years of active service during World War II.\nClub rugby.\nTonkin joined the Gordon Club after his discharge and played the first of six matches for New South Wales in 1947. A powerfully built sprinter he added menace to every team in which he played because of his rare acceleration and scoring potential.\nRepresentative rugby career.\nHe missed a place in the Test against New Zealand in 1947 but was selected for that year's\nepic Wallaby tour and became one of the spearheads of Australia's attack in Britain after champion Manly winger Charlie Eastes broke his leg in an early tour match. Tonkin appeared on the wing in all five Tests of the tour using his blinding acceleration to get around his opposing wingers to score tries against Scotland and Ireland. He was also one of four kickers who figured in the Tests (along with Brain Piper, Trevor Allan and Bob McMaster) kicking two penalties against France in the Paris Test at Stade Colombes. Injury affected his representative prospects after the conclusion of the tour but he made a further Test appearance against the British Lions in Sydney in 1950.\nPost playing.\nTonkin became a lecturer in physical education after his football career ended and worked at Armidale Teachers' College where he also coached rugby. He retired in 1982, leaving the coaching of college rugby teams to John Hipwell."

        "title": "2009–10 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2009–10 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2009-10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was coached by John Beilein and played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the Crisler Arena, which has a capacity of 13,751, for the forty-third consecutive year. This season marked the team's ninety-third consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The team finished the season with a 15–17 overall record and a 7–11 conference record, which was tied for seventh in the conference standings. It was seeded eighth in the single-elimination 2010 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament where it advanced one round. On October 16, Michigan was one of five Big Ten schools to begin its season by celebrating Midnight Madness.\nFollowing the University of Michigan basketball scandal, the team had completed serving a scholarship probation imposed in 2003 two years earlier. During the probation, the team had had only twelve scholarships to offer instead of the usual thirteen. However, Michigan continued to be prohibited from affiliation with implicated athletes (Chris Webber, Robert Traylor, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock) until 2012, which meant, among other things, that the players could not help the university recruit. The team was expected to finish between third and fifth in the conference by most expert pollings. The team was led by a pair of Wooden Award preseason watchlist nominees: Manny Harris and DeShawn Sims. Harris, Sims and Zack Novak served as team captains.\nThe team won two of its first three games against ranked opponents (Connecticut and Ohio State). However, the season was a disappointment that included two buzzer-beater losses to conference co-champions Ohio State and Michigan State on field goals by 2010 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Evan Turner and 2009 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Kalin Lucas. After starting the season 3–0, the team never again won three games in a row. The team was nationally ranked to start the season, but never reappeared in the national polls after the third week of the season. Michigan ended the year with a 7–11 conference record (tied for seventh) and a 15–17 overall regular season record. Turner's buzzer-beater came in the second round of the 2010 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament in which the eighth-seeded Wolverines lost by a point to the top-seeded Buckeyes.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, Sims and Harris were named to the 2nd and 3rd All-Big Ten teams, respectively, by both conference coaches and the media. Following the Big Ten tournament both players were recognized as 2nd-team All-District selections by the National Association of Basketball Coaches.\nPreview.\nNovember 12, 2008, marked the first day of the early signing period for high school seniors wishing to become eligible student-athletes in the 2009–2010 academic year. The early period ended on November 19, 2008, for NCAA college basketball teams (the regular signing period is from April 15 – May 20, 2009). However, verbal commitments are usually accurate predictors of signing activity. Based on verbals and very early signings, Big Ten Conference rivals Indiana, Minnesota and Illinois had top 25 signing classes, but Michigan did not according to both ESPN and Scout.com. The team was the choice of four blue chip prospects who followed through on their verbal commitments and signed letters of intent including Matt Vogrich and Darius Morris. The Morris was listed among the top 15 point guards in the nation by Scout.com, Rivals.com and ESPN. Kelvin Grady, who had played 64 games and made 33 starts during his first two seasons, was going to transfer from the program at the end of the prior season, but he became a wide receiver on the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team. In June 2009, Jordan Morgan had surgery on his left knee to repair articular cartilage. The expected recovery time was four to five months. In October, it was unclear whether he would be able to join the team or whether he would redshirt.\nEntering the season, Harris was regarded by some as the most highly rated player in the Big Ten. E.g., the FOX Sports preseason All-American listed him on its second team. It included Michigan State's Kalin Lucas on its third team, Purdue's Robbie Hummel on its fourth team and Ohio State's Evan Turner on its fifth team. However, ESPN chose both Lucas and Turner to its preseason second-team All-American list, while Harris was not shown on a single ballot. Harris and Sims were named among the 50 preseason Wooden Award watch list nominees. Harris was also named to the preseason Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist. The 24-member Big Ten media panel selected Harris as a first team preseason All-Big Ten team member.\nThe 2009–10 schedule includes the Old Spice Classic, an ACC – Big Ten Challenge match against Boston College, games against preseason ranked power conference opponents Kansas and Connecticut as well as the 2010 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament.\nRoster.\n - denotes class status adjusted for used redshirt eligibility. \nSignees.\nIn addition to the four-year scholarship recruits above, Beilein recruited Eso Akunne as a preferred walk-on and eventually offered him a one-year scholarship commitment. Beilein also recruited Josh Bartelstein who extended his high school career at Phillips Exeter Academy after high school at Highland Park High School as a walk-on.\n2010–11 team recruits.\nThe 2010 class includes Tim Hardaway Jr., son of Tim Hardaway.\nSeason.\nPreconference.\nHarris opened the season by recording the second triple double in school history (Gary Grant was the first in the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament) with 18 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists against Division II during a 97–50 victory on November 14. Sims added 22 points and true freshman Matt Vogrich added 15 points on five-for-five three point shooting. Harris earned Big Ten player of the week during the first week of the year for the second consecutive season. Michigan struggled early against their first Division I opponent, by hitting only 4 of their first 21 shots. They recovered with a 29–13 run led by twelve points each from Harris and Sims to end the first half en route to a 77–55 victory against . Sims posted a career high 5 three point shots.\nDuring the Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan participated in the eight-team fourth annual Old Spice Classic at The Milk House in Orlando, Florida. On November 26, which was Thanksgiving Day, they defeated Creighton 83–76 in overtime when Harris fell one rebound shy of a triple double. Laval Lucas-Perry tied a career-high with 18 points and Sims added 16. The following day, they lost to a 6–0 Marquette team 79–65. They shot 12 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 20 from 3-point range. They lost the subsequent game to Alabama when a Darius Morris full-court drive was blocked.\nThe Wolverines began December competition in the ACC – Big Ten Challenge by losing to Boston College 62–58. The team ended its three-game losing streak by beating . The Wolverines were outrebounded 41–25 in a 68–52 loss to the Utah Utes. Michigan rebounded as both Harris and Sims posted season highs with 27 and 23 points respectively in a 75–64 win over . The Wolverines fell to 1–21 all-time against number one ranked teams when it lost to Kansas. In the team's final pre-conference game, they beat 76–46.\nConference.\nZack Novak and Stu Douglass led the Wolverines in scoring in their conference season opening 71–65 loss to Indiana on New Year's Eve. Sims and Harris led the way to the first conference victory on January 3 against a #15-ranked Ohio State team without its leading scorer, Evan Turner. On January 7, the Wolverines came from 16 points behind to defeat the Penn State Nittany Lions on the strength of four second half three point shots by Laval Lucas-Perry and 25 points from Sims. On January 10, they wasted a 17-point lead in a loss to Northwestern despite 24 points from Harris and 17 from Sims. On January 11, Sims became the second Wolverine to earn Big Ten Player of the Week for his efforts during week nine (January 4–10). The Wolverines won the January 14 rematch against Indiana under the leadership of Harris who had 17 second half points and Sims who added 20 points and 8 rebounds. Michigan then earned its first win against a ranked non-conference opponent and their second consecutive win against a ranked opponent on January 17 when it defeated #15 Connecticut 68–63 behind 18 points and 8 rebounds from Harris. Subsequently, they lost three consecutive games to ranked conference opponents. On January 20, Michigan opened up a lead on Wisconsin who missed its first eight field goal attempts. They led until Wisconsin tied the game with 4 minutes and 4 seconds remaining. Wisconsin scored two subsequent baskets to take the lead. Wisconsin held on despite 23 points and 13 rebounds from Sims. On January 23, while Manny Harris served a one-game suspension, Sims posted 21 points and Novak added 16, but after taking an 11–10 lead, the Wolverines surrendered a 16–2 run to Purdue that they never recovered from. On January 26, the Wolverines hosted Michigan State who needed a Kalin Lucas basket with 3.5 seconds to play to earn the win, which resulted in Michigan state posting a school-record eight consecutive conference victories to start conference play. On January 30, Michigan finished the month with a 60–46 win against Iowa to snap its three-game losing streak. Harris and Sims both contributed 20 points. Sims had 12 rebounds as well. Michigan scored the first 13 points of the game and after taking a 12-point lead into halftime, they scored the first 5 points of the second half.\nThe Wolverines began February with a 67–52 loss to Northwestern on February 2. Harris and Darius Morris, who each posted 11, were the high scorers. Northwestern pulled away with a 21–4 second half run. On February 6, Michigan lost 62–44 to 16th ranked Wisconsin, who shot 9 for 13 on three point shots in the first half and only missed seven total shots in that time. Then Michigan only made one shot in the first eight minutes of the second half. Then, Michigan went 7 for 14 on its three-point shots to beat Minnesota 71–63 behind 27 points from Sims and 20 from Harris. On February 16, Michigan recovered from a 5-point deficit in the final twenty seconds on late shots by Sims including a three-pointer with 6.1 seconds remaining. Sims had 27 and Harris had 20 points as they both accumulated 10 rebounds and the team shot 14–27 on its three-point shots. In overtime Michigan, come from three points behind. On February 20, despite 20 points by Harris, Michigan was unable to notch its first three-game winning streak against Penn State. On February 23, Michigan shot only 20% in the first half and fell behind 26–18 and trailed Illinois most of the rest of the game despite 15 points and 11 rebounds from Harris. On February 27, Michigan lost to Ohio State despite all of its starters scoring in double digits.\nOn March 2, Michigan defeated Minnesota 83–55 as Harris and Sims posted 23 and 22 points, respectively. The team posted its best shooting night of the season by going 32 for 53. On March 7, Michigan concluded its regular season with a 64–48 loss to Michigan State. None of Michigan's starters posted double digit scoring and Zack Gibson led the team with 10 points. The team only scored 14 points in the first half and did not score in the first 3 minutes and 50 seconds of the second half. As a result, the team fell to a 7–11 conference record and was accorded the eighth seed in the 2010 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament where they were matched against ninth-seeded Iowa. They defeated Iowa 59–52 behind 22 points, 9 rebounds and 3 steals by Harris. This earned them a matchup against the top-seeded Ohio State Buckeyes. After trailing #5-ranked Ohio State by a 51–38 margin, sharpshooting by Harris and Douglass brought Michigan to within 59–57, which led to a frantic finish. Harris hit a shot with 2.2 seconds remaining to give Michigan a two-point lead before Turner hit a 37-foot 3-point shot to win the game.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Non-conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Big Ten Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Big Ten tournament\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nIndividual Honors.\nHarris was named as a finalist for the 2010 Bob Cousy Award and a Midseason Top-30 finalist for the 2010 John Wooden Award.

        "title": "Norseman triathlon",
        "text": "The Norseman Xtreme Triathlon is a non-Ironman branded triathlon, point to point, race held in Norway annually. The distances are equivalent to those of an Ironman race with the swim starting from the loading bay of a car ferry, through the water of the Hardanger fjord to the local town, Eidfjord. At Eidfjord the competitors transition onto their bikes and then cycle 180 km through the mountains, the first 40 km of which is uphill (reaching 1200 m above sea level). After transition two (at Austbygdi, 190 m above sea level), the competitors then run 42.2 km of which the first 25 km (to Rjukan) are flat and following this they end up climbing the local mountain, Gaustatoppen, 1,880 m above sea level.\nThe race is \"unsupported\" so competitors need to have personal back up crews that follow them with cars to provide them with food and drink. The support crews also have to accompany their competitor up the final mountain climb due to the inherent dangers of being highly fatigued on a mountain. During this final mountain climb competitors are required to carry a backpack containing emergency food and clothing should the weather turn, whilst they are on the mountain.\nWeather and water.\nWeather conditions, strict health checks, and deadlines determine whether the race can be followed into the mountains and those that finish are given a black finishers top and take on the name \"Norsemen\". Those that do not make the cut-off time but complete the distance on a lower alternative route are given a white finishers top.\nThe water temperature in Eidfjord is a challenge to the organizers. In 2015 the water temperature was measured to 10 degrees celsius. The safety team then decided to make the swim 1900 meters instead of 3800 meters. After the race, the safety crew decided to start the \"Cold Water Research Project\", which will continue for several years including one or more PhD degrees in progress. The studies are led by Jonny Hisdal and Jørgen Melau. Other than cold water studies, the group also has started studies on biomarkers, lung functions and heart function. In 2019 there was a research effort at Norseman, and the research group has published their first scientific papers.\nParticipants.\nThe number of participants is limited to a certain number of competitors (290 for 2020; 250 are invited, from sponsors, media and the majority from a draw; around 40 from qualified XTRI World Tour races for the World Championship). Approximately 40% of the participants are from outside Norway; and about 15% are female. During the period 2003-2005, a total of 175 women (10.6%) and 1,852 men (89.4%) successfully finished the race.\nNorseman Xtreme Triathlon first took place in 2003 with 21 individuals at the start line. The race record (full swimming distance) is 09:52:10 by Lars Christian Vold (Norway) in 2017 for men and 11:16:10 by Mette Pettersen Moe (Norway) in 2018 for women."

        "text": "Orlando Sánchez Márquez (born September 7, 1956, in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico) is a former catcher in Major League Baseball. He played all or part of four seasons in the majors, from through , for the St. Louis Cardinals (1981–83), Kansas City Royals (1984) and Baltimore Orioles (1984). Listed at 6' 1\", 195 lb., he batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\nIn a four-season career, Sánchez posted a .218 batting average (24-for-110) with 11 runs and 12 RBI in 73 games, including three doubles, two triples and one stolen base without home runs.\nFollowing his playing career, Sánchez coached in the minor leagues.\nOn August 29, 2009, he coached the Mexican League champion Saraperos, when the team defeated the Quintana Roo Tigres 14–1 in the sixth game of the championship series.\nPro career.\nOrlando Sanchez was signed as an amateur undrafted free agent by the New York Mets. He made his professional debut as a 17 year old for the Marion Mets of the Appalachian League. In the year, Sanchez batted .206 over the course of 23 games. At the end of the 1975 season, Sanchez was released by the Mets, and signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in spring training the following year. Sanchez would spend the next few season playing in the minor league system for the Phillies. It wasn't until 1979 that Sanchez made it as far as Triple A, playing for the Phillies affiliate the Oklahoma City 89ers. Sanchez appeared in a handful of games, and had his best season in 1980, batting .306. However, the power hitting he enjoyed on the lower levels of minor league baseball did not follow him to triple-A. While playing in the Phillies system, he was pressed into service as a pitcher for the Pulaski Phillies. Sanchez surrendered a home run and ended up with a 27.00 E.R.A.\nWith Philadelphia, Sanchez was stuck without much hope of getting promoted to the big league club, especially since they had multi-time All-star Bob Boone as their starting catcher. When the Rule 5 draft came around the following winter, the Phillies left Sanchez exposed and he was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals. Sanchez made his MLB debut on May 6, 1981, against the Atlanta Braves. He was a late inning defensive replacement for Darrell Porter. He made only one plate appearance, that against Gaylord Perry, and grounded out to second.\nOver the course of the next couple of seasons, Sanchez would split his time from being Porter's back-up, to playing in the minors. At the end of the 1983 season, the Cardinals left Sanchez exposed and he was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the Rule 5 draft. He only appeared in 10 games before his contract was purchased by the Baltimore Orioles. Sanchez split the rest of the season between Baltimore and their Triple-A team, the Rochester Red Wings. he appeared in 74 games for Rochester, batting .305 Despite this, Sanchez was released by Baltimore at the end of the season and later signed with the Cleveland Indians and played for their Triple A team in Maine. After appearing in just 12 games for Maine, Sanchez was released. After being cut by Cleveland, Sanchez signed with Puebla Angeles of the Mexican League. Sanchez would play eight more seasons of pro ball in Mexico, before retiring in 1993 after spending the season with the Monterrey Industriales.\nManagerial career.\nIn 2006, Sanchez was named as the manager for the Vaqueros Laguna. The team finished 50–59. The next season Sanchez was the manager of the Olmecas de Tabasco, whom he led to a record of 56–54. In 2009, he was named the manager of Saraperos de Saltillo, with whom he'd manage the next few seasons. He led the team to a 59–48 record in his first year at the helm. However, in 2011, he had the worst season of his career, and was fired mid-way through the season with a record of 36–50. He was replaced by Noe Munoz. Over the course of the next two seasons he managed the Acereros de Monclova and Vaqueros Laguna before returning to Saltillo in 2017. He currently has a record of 660 wins and 675 losses in his managerial career."

Since Williams was the team's best player, his suspension ended up being only one game when Jackson, his victim, urged coach Doc Sadler to reinstate Williams for the good of the team."

        "text": "The Loyola Greyhounds men's lacrosse team represents Loyola University Maryland in NCAA Division I lacrosse. Its home matches are played at the Ridley Athletic Complex. Charley Toomey has served as its head coach since 2006. It became a member of the Patriot League along with the university's other intercollegiate athletic programs on July 1, 2013. The Greyhounds were a member of the ECAC Lacrosse League from 2005 to 2013. It became the first member of the conference to win a national championship in 2012. It was also the first national title in the university's Division I history.\nLoyola, a Jesuit university with over 3,700 undergraduates, has produced 13 USILA First Team All-Americans, 25 Second Team All-Americans, 18 Third Team All-Americans, and 68 Honorable Mention All-Americans. The Greyhounds local rivals are the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, located just down Charles Street. The annual lacrosse game played between these two institutions is known as the \"Battle of Charles Street\". The program also has another significant rival in Baltimore, maintaining an annual series with the Towson Tigers since 1959.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe Loyola Greyhounds men's lacrosse team was founded in 1938 and coached by Jack Kelly. Kelly coached five seasons before leaving after 1942, with an overall winning record consisting of 21 wins and 14 losses. The Greyhounds struggled after Kelly left, going through two coaches in two seasons, both of which did not break .250. In 1947 began the reign of the program's longest active coach until that time, Bishop Baker. Baker coached for six consecutive seasons, almost breaking even with wins and losses. He was followed by John Mohler, who only coached for one year.\nCharles Wenzel.\nFor 17 seasons, from 1954 to 1970, the Greyhounds were coached by Charles Wenzel. Under Wenzel, the Greyhounds went .379.\nDave Cottle.\n From 1983 to 2001, for almost two decades under Head Coach Dave Cottle, Loyola saw growth in to their lacrosse program. In 1982, Loyola moved up from NCAA Division II lacrosse. Starting in 1983, Cottle brought the Greyhounds national attention. The Greyhounds advanced to the 1990 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship game where they were defeated by the Syracuse Orangemen. The 1990 championship, however, was revoked from Syracuse when investigations deemed the activity between coach Roy Simmons, Jr.'s wife Nancy and star player Paul Gait illegal. She signed the lease of his car earlier that season. Though the NCAA has yet to remove Syracuse from the record book, Loyola was the runner up and technically is the next in line for the trophy.\nIn 1999, the Greyhounds went undefeated in the regular season before losing in the quarterfinals of the 1999 NCAA tournament. His run lasted 19 seasons, beginning in 1983 through 2001, Cottle coached his teams to a winning record of 181 wins and 70 losses, including a run of 14 straight seasons where Loyola received an NCAA tournament bid.\nCharley Toomey.\nFollowing Cottle's long coaching tenure, Loyola hired Bill Dirrigl as their head coach. After four seasons Dirrigl was fired and Loyola graduate Charley Toomey took over as head coach in 2006. In both 2007 and 2008, Toomey led the Greyhounds to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament. The 2010 and 2011 NCAA lacrosse championships were held at M&amp;T Bank Stadium. Loyola, worked in conjunction with Johns Hopkins, Towson, and UMBC to run these events. The Hounds failed to advance to the 2009 NCAA lacrosse playoffs despite having the ninth place RPI, the third highest strength of schedule, and a 9-5 record. Instead Brown gained the slot because of their wins over Cornell and University of Massachusetts. Brown had an RPI of twelve, their schedule ranked a low of thirty six, and were ranked third in the Ivy League. Coach Toomey compared the 2009 Greyhound's dilemma to that of the 2006 Harvard squad saying, \"I can remember in 2006, Harvard gets in at 6-6, losing their last three games, and they said, ‘It's not a numbers thing, it's a strength-of-schedule thing.’ ... So what is it going to be? Is it going to be big wins or numbers? If it's numbers, we look doggone good. If it's about big wins, then we might be on the outside looking in.\" Harvard made the tournament over Toomey's squad that season, the reason being that their 'big wins' were not as competitive as Harvard's record, RPI and SOS. RPI vs. Big wins has been a very large argument in the NCAA tournament selection process the past few years.\nThe Greyhounds captured the first national championship in Loyola's Division I history in a 9–3 victory over Maryland at Gillette Stadium on May 28, 2012. They finished at 18–1, establishing a new program record for most wins in a campaign. Its only loss was a regular-season-ending 10–9 overtime defeat at home to Johns Hopkins on April 28. The team was led by attackers Eric Lusby and Mike Sawyer. Lusby was named the Championship's Most Outstanding Player after scoring four times in the Final and whose 17 goals were the most in a single NCAA tournament. He also set the school record for most goals in a single season with 54. Sawyer, who had previously set the school's new single-season scoring mark earlier in the season, was Loyola's first-ever Tewaaraton Trophy finalist.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Loyola's season results since the institution of NCAA Division I in 1971 (Loyola competed in NCAA Division II until 1983):"

        "text": "Thomas Ball Hamilton (September 29, 1924 – November 29, 1973) was a Major League Baseball player who played in 1952 and 1953 for the Philadelphia Athletics. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, and he was tall and 213 pounds. Used primarily as a pinch hitter, Hamilton appeared in the field in only 14 of the 67 games he played.\nPrior to playing professional baseball, Tom Hamilton attended the University of Texas at Austin, with whom he won the 1949 College World Series Most Outstanding Player award in the first year it was awarded. He is one of six players from University of Texas at Austin to win that award. The others are: J. L. Smith, Mickey Reichenbach, Calvin Schiraldi, Huston Street and David Maroul. In both 1948 and 1949, he was an All-SWC first baseman, and in 1949 he was also a first-team All-American. He hit .417 with a .848 slugging percentage in 1949.\nHe also played basketball at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a center. He was an All-SWC basketball selection in 1950, and he was the first player in school history to score 1,000 points.\nHamilton was signed by the Athletics in 1950, as an amateur free agent. He made his big league debut a couple years later, on September 4, 1952. He appeared in nine games in 1952, collecting two hits in 10 at-bats for a .200 batting average. In 1953, he played in 58 games, although he had only 56 at-bats. He hit .196 with no home runs and five RBI that year. On September 13, he played his final big league game. Overall, Hamilton hit .197 with no home runs and six RBI in 66 career at-bats.\nAlthough his big league career was over, his professional career was not. For example, on December 13, 1953, he was involved in a huge 11 player trade between the Athletics and New York Yankees. He was traded with Loren Babe, Harry Byrd, Carmen Mauro, and Eddie Robinson for Don Bollweg, Johnny Gray, Jim Robertson, Jim Finigan, Vic Power, and Bill Renna.\nIn 1971, he was elected to the University of Texas to Austin Hall of Honor.\nHe served as the baseball coach and athletic director at St. Edward's University at the time of his death in 1973. Following his death, he was buried in Cook-Walden Capital Parks Cemetery in Pflugerville, Texas."

        "title": "Handball Federation of Russia",
        "text": "The Handball Federation of Russia () commonly known by its acronym, HFR, is the national governing body of handball in Russia. Is a public sports organization with its primary focus centered on the development and promotion of handball. RHF serves as the governing body responsible for organizing and overseeing handball competitions throughout Russia. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in the management and coordination of the Russian national handball teams.\nHistory.\nIn Russia, handball rose to prominence in the early 20th century. The pivotal moment can be traced back to May 2, 1924, when two prominent handball clubs from Moscow met at the Site of (Experimental Demonstration Site of Universal Education) as part of the First All-Union Physical Education Festival of the USSR's Games Day celebration.\nThe game gained widespread popularity in the post-war years, particularly in two variants: one with 11 players per team and another with 7 players per team. Following the adoption of rules in 1948, the 11x11 version was referred to as “hand-ball”, while the 7x7 version became known as “handball”. Interestingly, even though the rules transitioned to 7x7 in 1962, the term “hand-ball” lingered in the Russian language and remained the official name of the sport until 1990.\nIn 1955, a public organization was established to promote handball, retaining the name “All-Union Section (Federation) of Handball”. By 1958, the USSR Handball Federation joined the International Handball Federation, enabling sports clubs and national teams of the USSR to participate in international competitions. The Soviet Union men's national handball team was formed in 1960, making its debut at the World Championship in Czechoslovakia in 1964 while the women's national team was established in 1962, subsequently participating in the World Championship held in Romania.\nA significant milestone occurred in 1989 with the founding conference of the Union of Handball Players of the RSFSR. Vladimir Maksimov, the 1976 Olympic champion and Honored Master of Sports of the USSR, as well as Honored Coach of the USSR and the RSFSR, was elected as the general director of the conference. Until 1992, the RSFSR Handball Union was part of the USSR Handball Federation, which unified sports federations across all union republics. Following the dissolution of the USSR, the All-Union Federation was dissolved, and on March 2, 1992, the Russian Handball Union (RHU) was established during a founding conference in Volgograd. Alexander Kozhukhov, Honored Master of Sports of the USSR and Honored Coach of the USSR, assumed the role of its first president. Vladimir Maksimov continued as the general director, with Yuri Reznikov, Honorary Master of Sports of the USSR, serving as vice-president, and Boris Makarov, an internationally certified referee, taking on the role of executive secretary. RHU became the legal successor of the All-Union Federation, securing its membership in the International Handball Federation and the European Handball Federation.\nAlexander Kozhukhov led RHU from 1992 to 2004, while Vladimir Maksimov retained his position as general director throughout the reporting and election conferences from 1992 to 2008. In 2004, Kozhukhov assumed the role of president of the commission responsible for organizing and overseeing competitions for the International Handball Federation. Consequently, he stepped down from his leadership position in RHU but continued as an advisor to the president and held the honorary title of Union president. In December 2004, Vladimir Grigoriev, Deputy Head of the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications and a former youth handball player in Zaporizhzhia, emerged as the sole candidate during the reporting and election conference. He helmed the organization for a single Olympic cycle, serving until November 2008. In January 2009, Boris Aleshin, General Director of AvtoVAZ, assumed the role of RHU's new president. During the reporting and election conference in March 2013, the Perm Krai Handball Federation presented its candidate, Vladimir Nelyubin, the current deputy of the regional Legislative Assembly, who also serves as the head of the Committee for Physical Culture, Sports, and Tourism of the Perm Region and is the president of the city martial arts club “Perm Bears”. Nelyubin defeated Aleshin in the second round of elections. Upon taking office, he initiated a renaming of the organization, leading to the change from the Russian Handball Union to the Russian Handball Federation.\nIn 2014, at the behest of the Russian Handball Federation, Dmitry Rogozin, Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and a Handball Master of Sports, assumed the role of heading its Board of Trustees. Come April 2015, there was a change in the Federation's presidency, with Sergei Shishkarev, Deputy Chairman of the Maritime Collegium under the Government of the Russian Federation and a Doctor of Law, stepping into the position.\nFast forward to December 2022, Sergei Shishkarev was elected as vice-president of the Russian Olympic Committee. Then, on February 1, 2023, the primary governing body of RHF, the Executive Committee, underwent transformation into the Supreme Council, with Sergey Shishkarev taking on the role of chairman.\nAwards.\nThe 1972 Summer Games in Munich marked the debut of Soviet handball players in the Olympics. At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, both the men’s and women’s national teams clinched gold medals. In the history of Olympic handball tournaments, the men’s national teams of the USSR and Russia, including the joint team, secured a total of six medals, with five of them being gold. The women’s national teams secured 7 medals, including three gold ones.\nAlexander Kozhukhov, who led the Russian Handball Union from 1993 to 2002, and Vladimir Maksimov were honored with prestigious awards from the International Olympic Committee – the Silver Olympic Orders – in recognition of their contributions to the development of the international Olympic movement. Additionally, in 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, the Russian Handball Union received recognition as the top handball federation in Europe according to the European Handball Federation. In 2015, RHF was bestowed with the highest accolade from the International Handball Federation – the Hans Baumann Trophy.\nBest handballers of Russia in the 20th century.\nIn 2001, the congress as well as the members of the executive committee of the Handball Union of Russia named the best Russian handballers of the 20th century. The voting results were:\nAchievements.\nUSSR men’s national team\nOlympic Games\nWorld Championships\nRussian men’s national team\nOlympic Games\nWorld Championships\nEuropean Championships\nUSSR women’s national team:\nOlympic Games\nWorld Championships\nRussian women’s national team:\nOlympic Games\nWorld Championships\nEuropean Championships"

Lynn won the league batting title with a .342 average and was a unanimous selection to the all-star team. He was sold to the Senators at the end of the season. In his only major league game, he had two hits in three at-bats, one of them a double.\nThe following season, Lynn was sent to Charlotte of the Piedmont League. He played two seasons in the Class A Eastern League before spending 1941–1945 in the service. His last season in professional baseball was 1948."

        "title": "Indianapolis 500 traditions",
        "text": "Due to the longevity of the Indianapolis 500, numerous traditions surrounding the race have developed over the years. Traditions include procedures for the running of the race, scheduling, and pre-race and post-race festivities. For many fans, these traditions are an important aspect of the race, and they have often reacted quite negatively when the traditions are changed or broken.\nAs part of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, the pre-race ceremonies of the Indianapolis 500 feature several patriotic songs. Like most other sporting events, the national anthem is performed before the race by a notable vocalist. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the annual singing of the chorus of \"Back Home Again in Indiana,\" and the victory lane bottle of milk.\nMonth of May.\nThe two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May [at Indianapolis]\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. The policy was typically to make the track available for practice no later than May 1, although in most years, few if any competitors might be on the grounds yet. It was not uncommon for local entries to begin setting up in the garage area in early/mid-April to work on their cars. Out-of-town or overseas entries sometimes arrived in Indianapolis (sometimes after lengthy travels) and set up shop in a local garage before moving into the track. In some years, the track might even be available for practice and testing as early as mid-April. For instance, in 1932, cars began to arrive on April 6, and in 1969, the first day of practice was April 28. In very early years, it was not uncommon for the track to be closed on Sundays during practice, or be open for only competitors with the gates closed to the public. In 1974, due to the energy crisis, the schedule was reduced, and the track opened instead three weeks before race day. The change was well-received, and the new schedule was made permanent, with various tweaks over the years.\nIn 2014, a second race at Indianapolis was introduced to the IndyCar Series schedule, conducted on the track's road course. The new event is held two weeks before the 500.\nThough not part of the month of May, since the mid-2010s, Founders Day has been recognized and celebrated at the Speedway each year on March 20. That coincides with the date in 1909 in which the Speedway was incorporated. Since 2017, Founders Day is used to announce inductees of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame, with the formal induction taking place during the month of May.\nMemorial Day.\nThe race has always been scheduled in conjunction with Memorial Day. Through 1970, the race was held on Memorial Day proper (May 30), regardless of the day of the week, unless it fell on Sunday. In those cases it was scheduled for Monday May 31. After the Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, the race was scheduled as part of the three-day Memorial Day weekend - either the Saturday, the Sunday, or the Monday of the holiday weekend. Since 1974, the race has been scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, and has been held on a Sunday with only two exceptions due to rain delays.\nSundays were avoided for scheduling race activity dating all the way back to pre-500 races in 1909 and 1910. In early decades, Sundays were occasionally used for practice and/or qualifying, but were used sparingly in pre-World War II years. In some early years, practice may have been permitted on Sundays, but the gates might not be open to the public. When Tony Hulman bought the Speedway after World War II, Speedway management continued to refuse to schedule the race on a Sunday, a policy that stayed in place through 1973. Qualifying and practice, however, were regularly held on Sundays during those years, with no days closed to spectators.\nArmed Forces Day also falls during the month of May, and usually coincides with one of the weekends of time trials. Since 1978 at the Speedway, that weekend is often filled with activities honoring the U.S. military, including an oath of enlistment ceremony.\nRadio.\nCoverage of the Indianapolis 500 on radio dates back to 1922. The longtime flagship of the IMS Radio Network is WFNI AM 1070 (formerly 1070 WIBC). The network dates back to 1952, and was initially launched using WIBC talent. Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, the station has featured extensive daily coverage of practice, qualifications, as well as pre-race and post-race coverage on race day.\nFrom 1971 to 2020, the most popular and most traditional daily show during the month of May was Donald Davidson's \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\".\nConcerts.\nSince the early 1990s, concerts featuring a top act(s) have been held the weekend of the race. Originally the concerts were held downtown the night of Carburetion Day, sponsored by local radio station WFBQ. In 1998, the Carb Day concert was moved to the track. Numerous other local bands, indie bands, garage bands, and smaller musical acts perform at other times during the month on days featuring track activity. Prior to 2005, Carb Day was the Thursday before the race, and since 2005, Carb Day has been the Friday prior to the race. Currently, the Carb Day concert is typically held in the afternoon, following the conclusion of on-track activity. Starting in 2014, a second headlining concert has been held on Legends Day. The Carb Day concert has typically featured rock groups, while Legends Day typically stars country music artists. The performers have been as follows:\nLast Row Party.\nA few days before the race, the \"Last Row Party\" has been held for charity since 1972. It is a scholarship benefit organized by the Indianapolis Press Club Foundation, and is usually held the Thursday evening or Friday evening before the race. Currently it is held at one of the suites in the Pagoda, and previously it was held at the Speedway Motel. The event is conducted as a roast and cocktail party for the final three qualifiers in the 500, who will be starting on the eleventh and final row (positions 31, 32, and 33). Due to the complex qualifying procedure for the race, these three drivers are usually, but not always, the slowest three cars in the field. Like Mr. Irrelevant, often some of these drivers are obscure, and several have been race rookies. Some are noted for a dramatic last-minute qualifying effort to secure a spot in the lineup, while others may have survived a Bump day scare, or an otherwise tumultuous month of May, to hold on to make the field. Ten former or eventual race winners have participated in the honor at some time during their career (Rutherford, Johncock, Sneva, Cheever, Lazier, Hunter-Reay, Kanaan, Sato, Power, Rossi).\nIn addition to being on the receiving end of numerous good-natured jokes and jabs, the three drivers are presented with a special jacket, various gifts, and checks for 31¢, 32¢, and 33¢, respectively. The group becomes known as the \"11th Row Society\", an enjoys a buffet dinner, apéritif, cocktails, and hors d'oeuvre with attendees. Later they may sign autographs and pose for pictures, in what is generally a fun and laid-back environment. The emcee for the event is usually a media figure, and past hosts include Bob Jenkins, Robin Miller, Jack Arute, Dave Wilson, and Laura Steele. The 2015 and 2016 co-emcees were Curt Cavin (\"Indianapolis Star\") and Chris Hagen (WXIN). Lindy Thackston hosted the event for 2017 and 2018. The 2013 reception was not held but a brief ceremony was held on Carb Day to recognize the honorees.\nPublic drivers' meeting and Legends Day.\nThe day before the race, a ceremonial drivers meeting is held at the track, which is open to the public, and is popularly attended. This tradition dates back many decades. During the meeting, the 33 starting drivers are presented with their starter's ring and various awards and trophies are handed out (such as trophies from the previous year's race, qualifying awards, lifetime achievement awards, etc.) The drivers are usually seated on a platform situated in the eleven rows of three, and numerous other celebrities and special guests may be honored or give remarks. Rules clarifications, instructions for the race, and other pertinent information is also discussed in the open forum. Drivers who can not attend due to scheduling conflicts (e.g., participating in another race) will usually have another team member or family member participate on their behalf.\nThis drivers meeting is separate from the official drivers meeting, organized by race stewards. That meeting, held the morning of the race, is strictly closed to the public and the media.\nStarting in 1998, the days leading up to the race have included ceremonies and activities honoring former drivers. In some years, each day during the week would have a featured Indy legend, and might feature the driver taking ceremonial laps around the track in one of his winning race cars, or in a pace car. Other years utilized Opening Day as an opportunity to honor Indy legends. In addition, the day before the race was expanded to include an autograph session featuring the 33 starting drivers, former drivers, Q&amp;A sessions, car displays, a \"fanfest\" midway, a memorabilia show, and other festivities. Starting 2011, the events of the day before the race have been officially themed \"Legends Day,\" and features a designated honoree. In addition, Legends Day showcases the classic cars of the 500: fans are able to get close looks and take photos of the machines, with a number of historic race cars also running laps of the circuit.\nLegends Day honorees\n500 Festival Parade.\nThe 500 Festival is a non-profit organization founded in 1957 to organize various civic events in the city of Indianapolis leading up to the race. The festival includes more than 50 events and programs celebrating the Indianapolis 500, including its two largest events, the OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon in early-May and the 500 Festival Parade the day before the race. Other events have included \"Community Day\" at the track, memorial services, luncheons, and the annual Snake Pit Ball, a black tie socialite gathering downtown. The 500 Festival attracts an annual attendance of about 500,000.\nIn many years, the parade grand marshal has been a celebrity with ties to Indiana or the Indianapolis area, particularly Indianapolis-area sports figures. In many cases, the grand marshal of the parade is also honored during pre-race festivities on race morning. The organizing committee boasts the parade as one of the largest in the nation. In 1997, a fire swept through the storage hangar housing the floats for that year's parade, threatening to cancel the event. Only four floats were spared, and Buddy Lazier's 1996 winning car escaped the fire only because the museum had decided to wait a few extra days before delivering it to the float staging area. The parade went on as scheduled but in a slightly retooled format.\nThe grand marshals for the annual parade have been as follows:\nTrack lore.\nThe atmosphere at the track during the month of May and on race day has long been a source of traditions.\nThe Brickyard.\nThe nickname of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the \"Brickyard.\" When the track opened in August 1909, the surface was composed of crushed stone and tar. This surface quickly was deemed unsuitable and dangerous after multiple accidents. In the fall of 1909, the track was paved in brick. In just over two months, 3.2 million bricks were hand laid on a bed of sand and the gaps were filled with mortar. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track the \"Brickyard\". Beginning in the 1930s, portions of the track were paved over in asphalt, beginning with the turns. By the late 1950s, only a portion of the mainstretch remained brick.\nFollowing the 1961 race, the remaining part of the mainstretch was paved over, and the entire track was now covered in asphalt. One yard of bricks was left exposed at the start/finish line. The vast majority of the original 3.2 million bricks remain in place, several inches beneath multiple layers of asphalt. Some bricks have been unearthed from the track over the years, namely in the locations where the infield access tunnels have been constructed. Subsequent repavings of the track in 1976, 1988, 1995, and 2004, have preserved the bricks in place underneath. However, the yard of bricks exposed at the start/finish line has been dug up in those instances by milling operations. Different bricks - ostensibly bricks that were dug up at one point from other parts of the track - were cleanly re-laid in that place, both for safety and aesthetic reasons.\nIn 2000 when the new Pagoda and Pagoda Plaza were built, the yard of bricks was extended from the track surface across the pit lane and then through to the spectator areas in the new Pagoda Plaza.\nGasoline Alley.\nThe garage area at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is known as \"Gasoline Alley.\" The nickname dates back to the early decades of the race, and for a time, referred specifically to one particular spot in the back where cars would refuel. Though the exact origin of the name is unclear, it may be loosely linked to the eponymous comic strip. Later, the nickname was used for the main corridor of the garage area, and eventually was used colloquially for the entire garage complex. The use of gasoline at the Indy 500 was phased out in favor of methanol beginning in 1965 (and later ethanol in 2006), but the nickname nonetheless remained. Gasoline was not used again at Indy until NASCAR arrived for the Brickyard 400 in 1994.\nThe first garage area consisted of one double-sided bank of garages running east–west. It was in the same general location as the present day complex. In the very early years, the foreign entries were housed in a second garage complex outside of turn two. In 1929, a second row of garages was constructed alongside the first, creating the soon-to-be familiar Gasoline Alley corridor. The original garages were known for their signature green and white barn doors, and were sometimes visually compared to horse stables, as the complex loosely resembled a horse racing paddock.\nOne of the fixtures of the garage area in the pre-WWII years was Tom Bealle's diner, an outdoor restaurant and gathering place, popular with drivers, mechanics, officials, and fans. Bealle often allowed drivers to run up a tab during the month of May, allowing them to pay their bill once they received their prize money at the end of the month. Around 1974–1975, since the entry fee was still relatively small, Jim Hurtubise was known for entering three cars (despite perhaps only having one or two cars in running condition) in order to rent three garages. He would convert the third garage stall into a bar &amp; lounge to entertain himself and his team and friends, although officials and track management took a dim view of it. In later years, in order to curtail similar actions, entry fees were substantially increased and entrants were required to show proof of the car(s) existence before their entry was accepted. In addition, by the 1980s, teams began setting up hospitality tents specifically for that purpose, and furthermore, an abundance of permanent hospitality suites - many adjacent to the garage area, were later constructed to supplement.\nA fire swept through the garage area on the morning of the 1941 race, and burned down a significant portion of the south bank of garages. They were replaced, and eventually the complex expanded to 88 stalls. As the sport grew, and the cars and teams became larger and more sophisticated, work space was increasingly limited in the garages. Amenities were simple, corridors were heavily congested, and by the 1980s, the cars and teams had outgrown the aging facility. With car counts swelling in the 1970s and early 1980s to sometimes over 100 entries, some smaller teams were left out and forced to work out of tents. Even the formidable teams found themselves needing to store some of their equipment (tools, tires, bodywork, etc.) outside the doors or back at their transporters because there simply was not enough room. A second fire during a private test session in 1964 caused damage, and raised concerns about safety.\nDespite their lack of modern amenities, the garages had a nostalgic quaintness admired by participants and fans, and they also served important intrinsic purposes for the teams. For many years, the entry fee for the Indianapolis 500 provided a garage stall to the competitors not just for the month of May, but for the entire offseason as well. It was a valuable asset to some teams, especially small-budget teams without a race shop, and it would serve as their year-round headquarters. It was not uncommon for teams to even house other types of race cars there (sprints, midgets, stock cars) as they competed in the Indiana short track circuits during the summer. Even larger, more established teams still might use the garage stall for storage or as a staging location for cross-country trips to other races.\nFollowing the 1985 race, the original Gasoline Alley garage area was torn down and replaced with a state-of-the-art, multimillion-dollar garage complex. The nickname \"Gasoline Alley\" remained when the new complex opened in 1986. In 2000, an additional row of garages was constructed alongside the pit lane on the main stretch, in preparations for the U.S. Grand Prix. Although the pitside garages are used during the Brickyard 400 for NASCAR inspection and top Cup Series teams (lower teams and the Xfinity Series teams use Gasoline Alley), they are specifically not considered part of Gasoline Alley. Today in total, there are 133 garage stalls. With Gasoline Alley utilizing 3 buildings with 32 stalls each, and the main straight garages areas with 37.\nThe Snake Pit.\nThe infield of the track in the vicinity of turn one was known as the \"Snake Pit.\" (sometimes \"Snakepit\"). Long known for a reputation of rowdiness, heavy alcohol consumption, bikers, streaking, flashing, and an overall Woodstock/Mardi Gras atmosphere, the Snake Pit was a popular location for college-age and counterculture fans to spend time at the track, many of whom had little or no interest in the actual racing activities. Like the infield at the Kentucky Derby, the Snake Pit was often considered a rite of spring, and an excuse to party with abandon. Arrests for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, fights, and drug possession were frequent and common.\nThe area that eventually became the Snake Pit took shape very early on, prior to World War I. In the early decades of the Speedway, a railroad line connected Union Station in downtown Indianapolis out to the track and beyond. Many fans in the early years (and through 1963) arrived at the race by train. A train depot was located across the road from the Speedway, near the intersection of present-day 16th Street and Georgetown Road. The spectators disembarked the trains and poured directly into the main entrance, strategically placed across from the station at the outside of turn one. Fans that did not have grandstand tickets gathered in the general admission infield, particularly the turn one infield. The area became a popular place for picnicking and race viewing. Sometime in the mid/late-1950s, it started to gain a raucous reputation, which intensified in the 1960s. It reached its zenith of popularity and intensity of revelry during the decade of the 1970s. The nickname \"Snake Pit\" was coined sometime in the early/mid-1960s, and appeared in print at least as early as 1968.\nIn periods of rain, the area usually became overwhelmed with mud, and mud wrestling was commonly observed. By the end of the race, the area would be littered with cans, bottles, and inordinate amounts of trash and abandoned belongings. Bonfires and burned cars were also noted. In 1975, management allowed cars to fully park in the area, as an early effort to settle the crowd by reducing available capacity. Occasionally, the rowdiness was reported as less tumultuous, such as 1977 when many infield revelers instead stormed the fountain in front of the Speedway museum to cool off from the hot day.\nIn 1980, a fatality occurred in the area after a Jeep flipped over. Around that time, track management decided to take deliberate steps to curtail the revelry, and make the infield more \"family-friendly.\" For the 1981 race, bleachers were erected in the turn one infield. In addition, capital improvements that included the new Gasoline Alley, a place for competitors to park motor homes, new support buildings, new restroom buildings, media parking lots, and other changes to the site, gradually and deliberately scaled back the size of the area. As a result, by the late 1980s, the patrons migrated to the infield of turn four, and the less-intense Snake Pit II emerged.\nBy the 1990s, the intensity of the rowdiness had dropped substantially, due largely to third-generation management at the Speedway (Tony George) and beefed up law enforcement. By the end of the 20th century, it almost disappeared completely.\nThe turn four infield was razed in 1999 to make room for the infield road course. The race day party scene migrated again, this time to its current location, the turn three infield. The Snake Pit eventually became more of a festive party zone. Later, the original turn one location was also razed to make room for road course modifications, a section sometimes referred to as the \"Snake Pit\" section. In 2010, the turn three infield was officially named the [New] Snake Pit, and began to be organized and officially marketed by management. On race day, a concert stage is erected, and popular music acts, and DJ's perform to entertain the infield crowd in a controlled and festive environment. While rock music typically headlines the Carb Day concert, and country music headlines the Legends Day concert, EDM is featured at the Snake Pit. In the mid-2010s, the revelry in the Snake Pit has somewhat re-intensified, however, not to the levels witnessed in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, the future of the Snake Pit is in doubt; during the 2019 NASCAR weekend, the track announced that a two-fifths mile (322m) dirt oval in that section used during the NASCAR weekend for the Bryan Clauson Classic will become permanent. In addition, because of the discontinuation of the Indiana State Fairgrounds for motorsport, other races may be moved to the Speedway's dirt track.\nSnake Pit concerts (race day)\nCoke Lot.\nSimilar to the aforementioned \"Snake Pit,\" the Coke Lot which is located outside the track, is the most noteworthy and popular camping location on the grounds of the Speedway. Officially designated as Lot 1C, it has been nicknamed the \"Coke Lot\" for decades due to the presence of a Coca-Cola bottling plant located on an adjacent property. The lot is an open field situated just to the northwest of the track, outside of turn 4 of the oval, off of Georgetown Road. Long known for intense revelry and all-night partying (particularly on the night before the race), the Coke Lot is a festive area and party scene for RVs and campers, as well as tent campers. The lot typically opens a few days before the race and allows fans to stay through the entire race weekend. It has been observed by many that the outline of the main parcel of the Coke Lot coincidentally resembles the outline of the state of Indiana.\nWhile the Coke Lot is the most notorious camping area, several other camping lots are also situated around the vicinity of the Speedway, some focusing on family-friendly environments, while others are considered premium lot for high-end RV'ers.\nIn years past, another camping area called the \"North 40\" (named due to its size of approximately 40 acres) was another scene of intense overnight revelry. In the 1970s, its revelry surpassed that of the Coke Lot. Located directly north of the track off of 30th Street, in close proximity to the Speedway's golf course, and backed up against a neighborhood of homes, it is no longer used for camping. Currently it is only utilized for daytime car parking, and employee parking. During its peak, security had to begin using giant searchlights to keep North 40 campers from illegally wandering onto the golf course property late into the night.\nFood.\nA traditional food of choice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the pork tenderloin sandwich. The sandwich is a well-known Midwestern creation, and is sold at the track concessions.\nBeer (largely domestic) is consumed in considerable amounts at the track. Unlike most sports stadiums and arenas, at Indianapolis (and most speedways), spectators are allowed to bring their own alcoholic beverages into the track for consumption. Beer is also sold at concessions. Glass bottles, however, are strictly prohibited at the track. Broken glass is considered an extreme hazard to the race cars (cut tires) on the track.\nPeanuts are considered bad luck. An ambiguous, long-standing superstition against eating peanuts at the racetrack has dominated Indianapolis dating back to at least the 1940s. Legend says, though unconfirmed, that a crashed car was found with peanut shells in the cockpit. As of 2009, however, peanuts are sold at trackside concessions, and the myth has lost a lot of its following.\nFrom the mid-1960s until her death in 1975, Mary Catherine \"Mom\" Unser (mother of Jerry, Bobby, and Al) was a well-known fixture at the race. She became famous for her spicy chili. Each year, she would treat the participants to a cookout in the garage area.\nSeveral local restaurants, both current and former, have been popular gathering places for participants and fans during the month of May. Establishments include St. Elmo Steak House, Charlie Brown's Pancake and Steak House, Mug-n-Bun, and Long's Bakery. The aforementioned Tom Bealle's diner was a fixture of the garage area for many years. Redevelopment of Speedway's main street has created an area of popular establishments and nightlife, including Sarah Fisher's 1911 Grill (since closed), and A. J. Foyt's Foyt Wine Vault. A White Castle used to stand across the street from the track, as did a Steak 'n Shake, but both have since been demolished. From the 1930s to the 1960s, Mate's White Front Tavern was a popular hangout for drivers and crews. Located just a few blocks east of the speedway, it was sold to new management in the early 1960s and was kept open until the mid-1980s. A Taco Bell just east of the Speedway has gained subtle notoriety with fans after IndyCar drivers Scott Dixon and Dario Franchitti were mugged in the parking lot in 2017.\nSuperstitions.\nNumerous superstitions have developed at the Indianapolis 500 over the years. Most date back many decades, although some have lost a considerable amount of following. Among the prevailing superstitions in the modern day include the ongoing \"Andretti curse\" and \"Curse of the Smiths\" (see below).\nOlder superstitions that have been popular at Indianapolis include some of the following:\nCurse of the Smiths.\nAmong the who have participated in the Indy 500, none have had the last name Smith, the most common surname in the United States. Several Smiths have attempted to make the race, the last being Mark Smith who failed to qualify in 1993 and 1994, despite finishing 5th at the Michigan Superspeedway in a 1994 CART race. By contrast there have been ten different drivers with the last name Jones, and five with the last name Johnson.\nOnly two drivers with the surname Smith have ever competed in professional races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, albeit in different events. Regan Smith drove in the Brickyard 400 from 2008 to 2013 (with a best finish of 3rd in 2011). He also has competed in the Lilly Diabetes 250. Motorcyclist Bradley Smith competed in the Red Bull Indianapolis GP, with best finish of second in 2009.\nOne driver with a German language translation of Smith has participated, however, with Sam Schmidt making three starts.\nRabbits.\nA longstanding legend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway involves bunny rabbits. From 1911 to 1993, there was traditionally only one race held annually at the Speedway. Activity outside the month of May was limited to semioccasional tire testing. Thus for eleven months out of the year, the grounds were noticeably quiet, green and lush, particularly after nine holes of a golf course were built in the spacious infield in 1929. The well-manicured grounds naturally became a home for fauna, particularly rabbits and other small vermin. As the race participants would arrive in the spring, they would often be greeted by numerous rabbits roaming the grounds, oftentimes running out on the track. The rabbits were thought to be welcome and some considered them symbols of good luck. However, they were sometimes a nuisance, causing yellows for running out on the track and evading capture. Al Unser, Sr. famously ran over a rabbit during the 1988 race. The well-known presence of rabbits at the Speedway even began a tradition that a rabbit would appear somewhere in the race program each year.\nPre-race ceremonies.\nThe pre-race ceremonies usually go in the following order:\nGrand marshal.\nIn some years, a grand marshal has been named for the race. The duties of the grand marshal may include greeting drivers and dignitaries during pre-race ceremonies, and riding in the pace car. This person may or may not be the same grand marshal at the 500 Festival Parade. Unlike other races, the grand marshal does not give the starting command. In recent years, the grand marshal has been responsible for delivering the \"Drivers to your cars\" message.\nNational anthem.\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has been performed before the start of the Indy 500 in most years. Up through the 1970s and early 1980s, the song was typically played by the Purdue All-American Marching Band without a vocalist. However, in some rare occasions, a vocalist was used. In 1976, Tom Sullivan and Up with People were invited to sing, as a gesture to the U.S. Bicentennial.\nBy the mid-1980s, the Speedway began inviting notable artists to perform the national anthem. In nearly all cases, they would be backed by the Purdue Band. In 1983, James A. Hubert flubbed the lyrics. He omitted the line \"O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\" and instead repeated the second line \"What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming\", stumbling on the word \"twilight\" the second time around.\nAfter the national anthem is performed, the public address announcer or the grand marshal gives the command \"Drivers, to your cars!\"\nIn 2001, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith caused a controversy after he changed the lyrics of the song. Recent performers include:\nOther songs.\nIn most years since 1991, the songs \"America the Beautiful\" and/or \"God Bless America\" have been performed. Florence Henderson, a native Hoosier, was a friend of the Hulman-George family that owned the Speedway at the time. Henderson performed one of the two songs numerous times, book-ending years when she performed the national anthem instead. Her performances were usually not televised.\nThe performance of \"America the Beautiful\" was introduced for the race's 75th anniversary running in 1991, in part due to Operation Desert Storm. Henderson switched to the national anthem for 1993–1997, then resumed \"America the Beautiful\" in 1999. In 2003, her performance was switched to \"God Bless America,\" which became more popular in the post-9/11 era. She continued through 2015, then served as grand marshal for her final race in 2016. Henderson died six months after the 2016 race. Henderson routinely sang the entire song, including the prologue, and in some years sang the chorus a second time.\nBy 2009, \"America the Beautiful\" was re-added to the ceremonies, with a different artist each year except 2016 and 2020. In 1999, Lee Greenwood did a special performance of \"God Bless the USA\", and in 2003, Darryl Worley performed \"Have You Forgotten?\". In 2005, 3 Doors Down did a special performance of \"Kryptonite\" from the Pagoda, as part of the driver introductions.\nInvocation.\nStarting in 1974, the Indy 500 was moved to the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. As a gesture, the Speedway added an invocation to the pre-race ceremonies. In most years since 1980, the Speedway has invited a representative of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. In selected years, others have been invited including nationally famous clergymen Oral Roberts and Billy Graham.\nThe Most Reverend Archbishop Edward T. O'Meara participated several times until his death in early 1992. Archbishop Daniel M. Buechlein then took over as the traditional clergy starting in 1993. Buechlein customarily ended his invocation with the word \"Godspeed\" in the languages of all of the participating drivers. Buechlein's final year at the race was 2009, and he died in 2018 after a lengthy illness.\nTaps.\nIn remembrance of Memorial Day, \"Taps\" is played, and a U.S. military aircraft does a flyover In some years, multiple aircraft participate, executing the missing man formation. Traditionally, a member of the public address announcing team recited a preamble honoring those who have died in combat, and those who have perished in automobile racing. The preamble dated back to at least 1965. Jim Philippe recited the preamble until he died in 2003. Since then, it has been reprised three times: Dave Calabro (2006), Jerry Baker (2012), and Bob Jenkins (2019). Since 2000, a notable military or government official has also offered a tribute or remarks.\nThe traditional preamble goes as follows:\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, \"Taps\" was typically performed by a combined U.S. Armed Forces color guard. Then from the about 1980 through 2005, it was usually played by the full Purdue Band. In 1986 and 1997, due to rain delays, the Purdue Band was unable to stay for the pre-race ceremonies. In those years, a substitute performer(s) was used. Since 2006, \"Taps\" has been rendered as a trumpet solo. In 2016, the trumpeter moved from the trackside victory podium near the pits to the starter's stand outside the main stretch. Since 2006 \"Taps\" has been rendered by a trumpeter from the 38th Division, Indiana Army National Guard Band.\nRendering of \"Taps\"\nRemarks\n\"Back Home Again in Indiana\".\nThe most traditional performance is the singing of the chorus of \"Back Home Again in Indiana\". This tradition has accompanied the race since 1946. Jim Nabors, accompanied by the Purdue Marching Band, notably performed the song in most years from 1972 to 2014. The song has long been the last event in the order of the day, immediately preceding the command to start engines.\nDuring the song, thousands of multicolored balloons are released from an infield tent. The balloon release dates back to 1947, and has coincided with the song since about 1950. The song, which was first published in 1917, is reported to have been first played at the race in 1919. A track side brass band played the song as Indiana-born Howdy Wilcox was finishing the final laps to victory.\nIn 1955, Dinah Shore became the only woman to perform this song during the race. In 1986, the race was rained out on Sunday and Monday, and subsequently postponed until the following Saturday. Robert McFarland of the Metropolitan Opera, who had performed the national anthem in two previous years, was scheduled to sing the song. However, due to the rain delay he was unable to return. John S. Davies, the Artist-in-residence of the Indianapolis Opera was brought in as a replacement.\nIn 1997, the race was rained out on Sunday, and the start was rescheduled for Monday. Nabors (as well as the Purdue band), had left the grounds by Monday morning. Rather than find a last-minute replacement, Nabors suggested that the Speedway utilize a recording of one of his previous performances. The Speedway replayed his 1993 rendition, and it was well received by the fans. Two days before the 2007 race, Nabors canceled his appearance due to an illness. On race morning, Nabors recorded a special video greeting to the fans from his Hawaii home, which was streamed over the Internet. Fans were invited to sing along with the Purdue band, and a \"get well soon\" message was displayed for Nabors. In 2008, Nabors made a well-received return, and received a standing ovation at the public driver meeting.\nNabors again missed the race in 2012 due to an illness. This time, the Speedway sent a film crew to his home in Hawaii, and recorded a performance on video that was played on the video boards on race morning. In March 2014, Nabors announced that the 2014 race would be his final performance. In 2017, Jim Cornelison was invited to sing, and his performance was critically praised. He has repeated his performance every year since then.\nStarting command.\nThe call for the engines to start has been traditionally made by stating \"Gentlemen, start your engines!\" When female drivers have competed, the call has been amended to \"Lady and gentlemen...\" or \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.\" In 2017, 2018 and 2020, the command was recited as \"Drivers, start your engines.\" In 2019 it returned to \"Lady and gentlemen...\" The starting command is customarily recited by a ranking member of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway board of directors, who also is a member of the Hulman-George family. Unlike other races, the starting command was not recited by the grand marshal.\nThe exact origin of the phrase is unclear, and there have been several conflicting accounts of who was the first to recite it, and what the exact wording of it was. Prior to World War II, it was commonplace for an aerial bomb to signal the start of the engines. Seth Kline was the official starter of the \"500\" in 1925–1926 &amp; 1934–1953. Kline is thought to have made an informal \"Gentlemen, start your motors!\" command as early as 1948 to accompany the bomb. The first documented case was in 1950, and that was recited by prolific public address announcer John Francis \"Irish\" Horan. Kline was again reported as saying it in 1951, (though some report it was Horan) Either Kline or Horan said it again in 1952. It was around that time the command was changed from \"...motors!\" to \"...engines!\" The participants and officials alike, preferred the more technical term \"engines\" to describe their machines. Sid Collins stated that chief steward Harlan Fengler explained to him \"there are no motors in the race, just engines.\"\nWilbur Shaw, president of the Speedway in 1946–1954, was once believed to be the person who coined the phrase, and it was erroneously claimed in his autobiography that he recited it in all the post-World War II years until his death. Speedway historian Donald Davidson, however, believes Shaw only recited it twice, in 1953 and 1954.\nAfter Shaw's death, Tony Hulman started reciting the command, and made it popular and famous. The normally soft-spoken and shy Hulman had a proud and vociferous version of the command annually. Hulman would rehearse the line, perfecting it for show, and was even known to work with radio broadcaster Luke Walton to draft cue cards to know when to stress certain words and syllables. After Hulman's death in 1977, his widow Mary F. Hulman took over the honor, followed by their daughter Mari George.\nIn 1977, Janet Guthrie became the first female driver to qualify for the Indy 500. Controversy surrounded the command, because the Speedway management did not want to alter the traditional phrase. During the week before the race, the management announced that they would not change the wording of the command. Looking for an excuse, they insisted that the cars were actually started by male crew members with an electric hand-held starter from behind the car. Guthrie and her crew were quite displeased by the stubbornness of the Speedway management, considering her unprecedented accomplishment. The crew reacted by assigning Kay Bignotti (wife of George Bignotti) as the crew member to operate the inertial starter at the back of Guthrie's car. The Speedway's argument fell apart, and they decided upon a special amended command for that year. They did not announce beforehand what the special command would be, and Hulman's highly anticipated phrase was the following:\nIn 1978–1979, when Guthrie again qualified for the race, the command was simply amended to \"Lady and gentlemen, start your engines.\" In 1992, Lyn St. James became the second female to qualify for the race. She publicly requested, albeit not contentiously, that the command be changed to \"Drivers, start your engines.\" The request was dismissed, and the command used was the now customary \"Lady and gentlemen...\" variation. That variation, along with \"Ladies and gentlemen...\" were used many times over the next two decades. In 2017, Pippa Mann was the lone female driver in the field, and Tony George gave the command as \"Drivers, start your engines.\" This was the first time that this variation of the command was used for the race.\nFor many years, the traditional location for giving the command was at the pace car in the front of the starting grid. Public address announcer Jim Philippe normally introduced the command, describing it as the \"traditional command\" or the \"famous four words.\" Phillippe's final \"500\" was 2003. Likewise, for many years through 1989, Luke Walton traditionally introduced the command on the radio network broadcast. Since 2004, current public address announcer Dave Calabro introduces the command normally by calling it the \"most famous words in motorsports.\"\nIn most cases, Tony Hulman would give the command, then ride in the pace car during the pace laps. Mary F. Hulman would give the command near the pace car, but rarely rode in the pace car due to her age and declining health. Eventually, the location was moved to near the start/finish line, and in 2001, it was moved to the new Victory Podium stage adjacent to the Pagoda. In 2011 only, Mari George moved back to the front of the starting grid to give the command, and then she rode in the pace car with A. J. Foyt. In 2014, as a special gesture to Jim Nabors's final performance at Indy, the starting command was given in unison by both Mari George and Nabors, marking the first time a non-member of the Hulman-George family had given the command for the 500 since 1954. In 2016 for the 100th Indianapolis 500, now-matriarch Mari was joined by three subsequent generations of the Hulman-George family, who gave the command together. Due to her advanced age, the 2016 race would be Mari's final turn giving the command. Later that same year, Tony George gave the starting command for the Brickyard 400, his first time giving a command since a restart command in 1986. For the 2017 Indianapolis 500, the duty was permanently assigned to Tony George. In that year, Tony George began using the phrase \"Drivers, start your engines\" instead of the more familiar \"Lady and gentlemen...\" variation. However, for the 2019 race, George recited that latter variation.\nRoger Penske, who purchased the Speedway from the Hulman-George family in November 2019, gave the starting command for the 2020 Indianapolis 500.\nOn occasions when an accident or rain has halted the race, a second command has typically been given. Years include: 1967, 1973, 1982, 1986, 1997, 2004, 2007. The amended command, \"gentlemen, re-start your engines,\" has usually been used. In 1986, this restart command was given by Tony George. In 1997, it was given by Mari Hulman George. In 1982 and 2004 the command was given by public address announcer Tom Carnegie.\nIn 1981, Mary F. Hulman was unable to recite the starting command due to an illness. In that year, Mari George recited, her first time performing the honor.\nOver the years, the starting command has been adopted to start all sorts of auto racing in the United States, including but not limited to NASCAR. However, in many venues outside of Indy, the phrase \"Drivers, start your engines\" appears to be the preferred version.\nHonorary starter.\nA recently added tradition is the use of an honorary starter. A special guest has been invited in recent years to wave the green flag to start the race. Starting in 2013, the tradition was expanded where another celebrity or special guest(s) arrives on race morning by helicopter to ceremoniously deliver the green flag or the checkered flag. The official starter (or \"flagman\"), however, is a trained race official, and handles the remainder of the flagging duties during the race. In 2010, due to two early caution periods, honorary starter Jack Nicholson elected to stay in the starter's perch for an additional few minutes, and was able to drop the green for the two subsequent restarts as well.\nCelebrity guests.\nSince the early years of the race, celebrities from all walks of fame have been invited to the race, some have returned for many years or even decades. Television and movie stars, recording artists, sports figures, politicians, and military, are among the many dignitaries invited. During the pre-race, a parade of stars is conducted around the track, usually in convertibles. In numerous years, celebrities have been invited to drive the pace car at the start of the race.\nClark Gable is seen in a famous photograph of the 1947 race. Among the many celebrities who attended or have attended multiple Indy 500s include Jim Nabors, James Garner (who drove the pace car in 1975, 1977 and 1985), David Letterman, Tim Allen, Florence Henderson, Linda Vaughn, and many others. Paul Newman, who starred in the Indy-related film \"Winning\", attended the race many times, and in 1983–1995, and then again in 2008, was at the race as co-owner of Newman/Haas Racing. Joyce DeWitt, who grew up in the Town of Speedway, and graduated from Speedway Senior High School, once worked at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ticket office.\nAt least three former U.S. Presidents (and one future President) has attended the Indianapolis 500. Following his presidency, Gerald Ford attended the 1979 race, serving also as the grand marshal of the 500 Festival Parade. After their presidencies, both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton attended the 2003 race, the first time in Indy history that two former presidents were at the same race. It was the elder Bush's second visit to the Speedway; he previously presided over the opening ceremonies of the 1987 Pan American Games, which was held at the track. Future President Donald Trump attended the race in 2002. Trump was selected to drive the pace car for the 2011 race, but withdrew the duty after drawing controversy from fans. In 1971, tentative plans were made for sitting president Richard Nixon to attend the race, as part of the NATO Conference on Urban Affairs that was being held in the city. Nixon was even rumored to be giving the starting command. Nixon would have been the first, and only to-date, sitting president to attend the race. However, the visit was later cancelled.\nAt least two presidential candidates have visited the Speedway during their respective election campaigns, owning much to the fact that the Indiana primary is usually held in May. Ronald Reagan visited the track during the month of May 1976, while he was in town campaigning for the 1976 Indiana Republican primary. Likewise, Hillary Clinton visited the track while campaigning for the 2008 Indiana primary and met with driver Sarah Fisher.\nAt least four former vice presidents have attended the race. The aforementioned Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Indiana natives Dan Quayle and Mike Pence. Quayle has attended the race numerous times, including three times as sitting Vice President (1989–1991). Pence has reportedly attended the race over thirty times, most recently in 2016, while he was the sitting Governor of Indiana and again in 2017 while he was sitting vice president. In 2018, Pence visited the track during practice, but not on race day.\nDavid Letterman worked as a reporter for ABC Sports during the 1971 race, and attended the race many times as a spectator. Since 2002, he has attended the race as co-owner of Rahal Letterman Racing. The team won the race in 2004 and 2020. At the 2015 race, Letterman was honored on the famous scoring pylon during the pre-race; just four days after he retired from the \"Late Show\".\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, several NASA astronauts from the Mercury and Apollo programs were among invited guests.\nPost-race.\nVictory Lane.\nImmediately after taking the checkered flag, the race winner drives to Victory Lane. The celebration to honor the winner begins with the car being wheeled onto a black and white checkered periphery. The driver is presented with the Borg-Warner Trophy, which is situated behind the car in a prominent location. A floral wreath (containing 33 lilies to commemorate the 33 drivers of the field) is placed around the winners neck, and the winner is presented with the traditional bottle of milk for refreshment. Interviews are taken for television, radio, and over the public address system. The driver's crew and team owner(s) also are invited to celebrate in victory lane, and are joined by numerous dignitaries, including the 500 Festival Queen and Princesses court, track and series personalities, celebrities, and various sponsor representatives. The Indianapolis 500 notably does not utilize a podium for the top-three finishers as is customary in other forms of racing, as well as at most other IndyCar events. Only the winning driver and team participate in victory lane celebrations, believed to be an homage to horse racing's Winner's Circle.\nIn the early years, victory lane was located at the far south end of the pit area, near the entrance to Turn One. For many years, it was identified by a large black and white checkered carpet. This location was used through 1970. In 1971, victory lane was moved to the horseshoe area located in front of the Master Control Tower. The car would be rolled up two checkered ramps, to a raised platform a few feet above the ground. In 1986, a new victory lane was constructed, which was a hydraulic lift in the pit lane. In 1994, after the pit lane was reconstructed, victory lane was moved back to the horseshoe area, this time on a large cylindrical platform.\nThe current victory lane is located beneath the Victory Podium stage, adjacent to the Pagoda. The podium, which was originally built in 2000 for the U.S. Grand Prix to serve as a 1st-2nd-3rd podium for that event and later MotoGP, SCCA, and USAC events, is not used as a podium for the Indy 500 or for the Brickyard 400. Instead it has been utilized as a stage for pre-race ceremonies. In 2020, as part of capital improvements by the new Penske ownership, the podium was upgraded to include a new hoist to lift the winning car on top of the victory podium platform stage, a throwback to the 1986-98 version of victory lane.\nBottle of milk.\nA long-standing tradition of the Indianapolis 500 is for the winner to drink a bottle of milk immediately after the race. This tradition dates back to 1936 after victor Louis Meyer asked for a glass of buttermilk, something his mother had encouraged him to drink on hot days. Meyer also reportedly drank milk after his victory in 1933, as did a few others in the immediate years afterward. The young tradition quickly went away, and for a time after World War II, was replaced by \"Water From Wilbur\" – a silver jug (resembling an ice bucket) filled with icy-cold water, presented by then-Speedway president, and three-time former winner Wilbur Shaw.\nBy 1956, the milk returned as a ritual as milk companies became sponsors of the race purse and handed a bottle of milk to the winner to promote their product. A sponsorship of currently $10,000 now paid out by the American Dairy Association if the winner sips the milk in victory lane. In 1993, Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice instead of milk after his victory. The snub drew considerable ire from fans. Later he took a sip of milk, at the urging of his car owner Roger Penske. Fittipaldi owned citrus farms in Brazil, and wished to promote his industry. As a result, he was booed in driver's introductions the following week by the crowd in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the heart of \"America's Dairyland.\" In 1981, Bobby Unser also did not drink the milk in victory lane. After Unser was tentatively stripped of his victory, Mario Andretti sipped from a bottle of milk the next morning during the traditional photo shoot.\nDrivers are allowed to choose what type of milk they want to receive, and the publication of the \"milk list\" is a popular event amongst fans. For the 2019 running of the 500, 21 drivers (including winner Simon Pagenaud) picked whole milk, 10 opted for 2 percent, Marcus Ericsson selected fat-free and defending champion Will Power did not list a preference. Several modern drivers, most notably Ed Carpenter and James Hinchcliffe, have said they want to drink buttermilk if they were to win out of respect for Louis Meyer's original tradition.\nSince the early 2000s, it has become increasingly common for winning drivers to pour some or all of the milk over their heads after drinking (in apparent emulation of champagne-spilling celebrations traditional at other races).\nBorg-Warner Trophy.\nA bas-relief sculpture of the winner's face, along with his name, average speed, and date of victory is added to the Borg-Warner Trophy. The trophy has been in use since 1936. A smaller replica of this trophy has been officially presented to the winner after the race since 1988 and team principal since 1997, usually in a press conference either at the Speedway or in Detroit at the North American International Auto Show at the BorgWarner exhibit, except for the 2011 race because of extenuating circumstances (the winning driver had died in a crash at an aborted INDYCAR race; the winning team principal and the driver's widow were presented with the respective trophies in the ensuing January). Prior to that, winners received a replica mounted on a chestnut plaque.\nOfficial standings.\nFor many years, the results of the race were considered unofficial until the following day. Immediately after the race, the sanctioning body would begin reviewing the scoring serials, as well as examine video tapes and film, in order to confirm the results, correct scoring errors, make judgements on rules infractions, and assess penalties (or rescind penalties) if necessary. It was not unusual for the vetting process to go late into the evening, beyond midnight, and into the early hours of the next morning. Traditionally, USAC would post the official results at 8 a.m. local time the morning after the race. Revisions were not unusual, as assessed penalties and scoring corrections would be announced in the official standings. However, most corrections were relatively minor, and seldom did drivers lose or gain positions in the final standings. A brief protest period would open for the teams to formally submit complaints, and if there were no protests, the official results would stand as published.\nThis policy was often a source of controversy, as in earlier years, this made officials apt to document rules infractions as they occurred, but not assess penalties until \"after\" the race – rather than during the race. Drivers and teams were sometimes not made fully aware of rules infractions until after they were issued a penalty the next morning. This prevented teams from being able to strategize and make up the penalty deficits during the race itself. In some cases, the penalty dropped them one or more positions in the final standings. By the early to mid-1990s, with speed limits being instituted on pit lane after a fatality during a NASCAR race in 1990, penalties that included making a pit stop without any further activities (\"stop and go\") or driving through pit lane at the prescribed speed limit without stopping (\"drive-through penalty\"), have replaced most post-race infractions.\nStarting in 1990, a new electronic scoring system was implemented, simplifying the scoring process. In that year, officials were done compiling the official standings very early Sunday evening, but still withheld the official release until 8 a.m. the next day. By 1993, the rules were amended such that the official standings would be released approximately six hours following the conclusion of the race (rather than the next morning). This was largely because computer and GPS-based scoring systems had automated the process, and barring any equipment malfunctions (as happened at Texas in 1997), serial scoring errors were almost non-existent; and significantly more accurate and reliable than previous hand-scoring methods. Manually-assessed penalties (such as one-lap penalties assessed for violations that occurred very late in the race) are occasionally a focus of post-race analysis and scoring revision, as those penalties are typically unable to be served before the race concludes.\nRelated events.\nIn the days leading up the race, numerous other related and unrelated events are held in and around Indianapolis.\nAs of 2017, the four racing events are held over four consecutive nights, leading up to the Indy 500 on Sunday. The Hulman Classic is typically Wednesday night, the Hoosier Hundred Thursday night, the Carb Night Classic Friday night, and the Little 500 on Saturday night."

        "title": "Bill Winter (American football)",
        "text": "William Richard Winter (born July 9, 1943 in Nitro, West Virginia) is a former Marshall University football player.\nHigh school career.\nWinter graduated in 1961 from Nitro High School and is one of the greatest athletes the school has ever produced. As a member of the 1958 football team, Nitro went 9-0-1 for their first undefeated season in school history (the team also featured his older brother Wilbur who played fullback and would captain the team one year later). Bill Winter was a key player in Nitro High School's 1960 season in which they went 10-0 in the regular season, outscoring their opponents 258-44. Nitro played in the West Virginia AAA state championship game. The Nitro Wildcats ultimately lost to Weir by a score of 40-0. This was Nitro High School's first appearance in a state football championship game. Winter was named to the All AAA West Virginia State Second Team. Of note, Winter's youngest brother Tom would also play linebacker and guard for the Nitro High School football team from 1964–1966; during this span, the team would go 8-22.\nCollege career.\nWinter went on to play college football at Marshall University. He received numerous offers at other schools including West Virginia University. He enjoyed a successful career playing on offense (guard), defense (linebacker), and on special teams (kick-off team and kicking PATs). Winter was one of only 4 sophomores to start for Marshall in 1962. He broke his ankle during the next to last game of the season against Xavier. After the game, Marshall head coach Charlie Snyder (American football) remarked, \"That boy is the greatest sophomore football player I've ever coached.\" He was named to the All Mid-American Conference 2nd Team in 1963. During this season, Marshall finished at 5-4-1, for their first winning season since 1957 and only their second since joining the MAC in 1954. In 1964, Winter was named captain of the team along with teammate Jim Cure. Marshall would have its best football season during its first tenure in the MAC (1954–1968), finishing 7-3 and 2nd in the Mid-American Conference. During this season, Winter was named to the 1964 All Mid-American Conference Team. After Winter's departure, Marshall would post a 7-31-1 record during their last 4 seasons in the MAC, going winless in the last two seasons (1967–68).\nIn 1990, Winter was inducted into the \"Marshall University Hall of Fame\". One year later, he would be named to the Marshall University Field of Dreams team during the dedication of Marshall University Stadium. The Thundering Herd defeated New Hampshire in that game before a crowd of 33,116.\nProfessional career.\nWinter was evaluated by several NFL/AFL teams including the Dallas Cowboys who felt he was too small to play his position. He would eventually be drafted by the Charleston (W.Va.) Rockets of the Continental Football League in 1965. Head coach Perry Moss said of Winter, \"There's a real football player.\" \"He sure came to play. I'd like to have more like him.\" Winter would see playing time as a linebacker against Fort Wayne (The Rockets would win 24-7) in a preseason game. Winter would leave the game early secondary to a laceration. He would later narrowly miss the final cut for the team. The Charleston Rockets would go undefeated at 14-0 in 1965 and defeat the Toronto Rifles 24-7 in the first Continental Football League championship game.\nThe following year, new Rockets Head Coach Sam Fernandez was reportedly interested in recruiting Winter back to the team saying, \"At that time [when he was cut], he just needed more experience. I feel he has the potential to be a fine pro player.\"\nCoaching career.\nAfter college, Winter coached football at Andrew Lewis High School in Salem, VA beginning in 1967. He was coaching at Andrew Lewis High School during the 1971 Virginia State Championship game depicted in the film Remember the Titans. The real championship game was much less dramatic than the movie version with Andrew Lewis falling to T.C. Williams High School 27-0. Winter went on to coach at Roanoke Catholic School and Salem High School in Salem, VA when it opened in 1977. He was an assistant coach for the Virginia Hunters, a semi-pro team. His coaching career would end in the 1980s.\nArchives.\n1963 Scores/Newspaper Articles\nMarshall 19, Toledo 18\nMarshall 20, Kentucky State 0"

It has been held annually since 2009 at the Abu Dhabi International Tennis Complex, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\nHistory.\nIn November 2008, sponsor companies Flash and Capitala announced with IMG their partnership to create a new tennis exhibition for the beginning of the season, to take place in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The event, first named \"Capitala World Tennis Championship\", was conceived to promote the sport in the region, creating another world class tennis event in the Middle East alongside the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Dubai Tennis Championships, already taking place in the UAE, the ATP Qatar ExxonMobil Open and the WTA Qatar Total Open, taking place in Doha, Qatar, and the WTA Tour Championships, also set in Doha from 2008 to 2010. The six-player, three-day exhibition, with a winner-takes-all prize money of US$250,000, preceded by weeks of tennis-themed activities in the region, including an amateur \"Community Cup\" tournament in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was created to take place early in the season, before the start of the actual tour events, as a warm-up exhibition for the top players, similar to the AAMI Classic in Melbourne.\nThe inaugural Capitala World Tennis Championship took place from January 1 to January 3, 2009, with Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Nikolay Davydenko, Andy Roddick and James Blake taking part. Murray won the event, defeating Blake, Federer, and then-World No. 1 Nadal in the final.\nAs of October 2009, Federer, Nadal and Davydenko announced they would return for the 2010 edition, with Stanislas Wawrinka, David Ferrer and Robin Söderling completing the field. Nadal went one further this time, defeating compatriot Ferrer in the semi-finals and Söderling in the final without losing a set. Federer won third place with victory over Ferrer.\nFor the 2011 edition of the tournament, Nadal, Federer and Söderling returned with Tomáš Berdych, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Marcos Baghdatis completing the six-man line-up. Nadal defended the title with a hard-fought victory over Federer after they respectively beat Berdych and Söderling in the semi-finals.\nThe second 2011 edition (held on December 29–31, 2011) featured Nadal, Federer, Ferrer, Tsonga, Novak Djokovic and Gaël Monfils. Djokovic won the title by beating Monfils and Federer before defeating Ferrer in the final. In the battle for third place, Nadal triumphed over Federer.\nOn December 30, 2017, Jeļena Ostapenko defeated Serena Williams in the first-ever women's match at the tournament."

After leaving school he went to work for the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad as a messenger boy. In 1885 he moved to Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where he worked as a secretary to industrialist William P.

Coler &amp; Co. banking house.\nGovernment service.\nIn 1898, Baker was hired as a secretary to New York City Comptroller Bird Sim Coler. Baker was active in Coler's 1902 gubernatorial campaign. Following Coler's loss, Baker went to work on Wall Street. In 1905, Baker returned to government service as a member of the New York City Civil Service Commission. He was made president of the board the following year. In 1908, Baker switched jobs with first deputy police commissioner Arthur J. O'Keeffe.

He was at the helm two years later when the Phillies played in the 1915 World Series.\nBaker was known for being extremely short sighted and tight-fisted. For most of his tenure as the Phillies' owner, the team had only one scout, and used a flock of sheep to trim the grass at their ballpark, mockingly nicknamed \"Baker Bowl\" by the press in 1923.\nBaker was so cheap that he sold star pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander and catcher Bill Killefer to the Chicago Cubs in rather than increase their salary. Within a year, the Phillies had crumbled to sixth place—the first of 14 straight seasons (and 30 of the next 31) without a winning record and Alexander and Killefer led the Cubs to the pennant.\nBaker died of a heart attack on December 4, 1930 while attending a league meeting in Montreal and was succeeded as Phillies owner by Gerald Nugent."

        "text": "Rinku Singh Rajput (born 8 August 1988) is an Indian professional wrestler and former professional baseball player. He is also known for his tenure in WWE, where he performed under the ring name Veer Mahaan, or simply Veer. \nSingh was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates organisation after he won a pitching contest on a 2008 reality television show \"The Million Dollar Arm\". He was the first Indian to play professional baseball and spent several seasons in the minor leagues, reaching the Single-A level. He is the subject of the movie \"Million Dollar Arm\".\nEarly life.\nSingh grew up in poverty, the son of a truck driver, in a rural village called Gopiganj, Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh. Singh was one of nine siblings who all lived in the family's one-room house. The home had electricity but relied on well water. Singh threw the javelin and played cricket as a little boy. He was a junior national javelin medalist. Singh is an alumnus of the Guru Gobind Singh Sports College, Lucknow.\nIn early 2008, Singh entered an Indian reality television show \"The Million Dollar Arm\". The contest was created by an American sports agent J. B. Bernstein and his partners Ash Vasudevan and Will Chang to find the individual in the country who could throw the fastest and most accurate baseball. Having never heard of baseball before, Singh won the contest out of over 37,000 participants after throwing 87 miles per hour. The grand prize for the contest was $100,000.\nAfter winning the contest, Singh and runner-up Dinesh Patel travelled to Los Angeles where they trained with University of Southern California pitching coach Tom House, who trained pitchers such as Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson. Singh said that most of his family did not agree with his decision to go to the United States. On their first day in the United States the two attended their first baseball game at USC. They continued to learn the game from House and Bernstein, as well as learning English.\nProfessional baseball career.\nSingh, along with Patel, tried out in front of scouts from 20 Major League Baseball teams in November 2008, and Singh's pitches reached . Reports from Pittsburgh Pirates scouts Joe Ferrone and Sean Campbell led to general manager Neal Huntington signing both to contracts with the organisation. With the deal, the pair became the first Indians to sign American major league baseball contracts. The total signing bonus for the two was $8,000. After training, the two returned to visit their families in India before entering Pirates training camp in Bradenton, Florida. Singh and Patel began the 2009 baseball season with the Pirates' Gulf Coast League affiliate.\nOn 4 July 2009, Singh became the first Indian citizen to appear in a professional baseball game in the US. He pitched the seventh inning, while Dinesh Patel pitched the eighth inning. On 13 July 2009, Singh won his first professional baseball game in America, striking out the only batter he faced. He finished the season with a 1–2 record and a 5.84 ERA in 11 games, allowing just one run on three hits in his final six appearances.\nSingh went 2–0 with a 2.61 ERA over 13 games with the Pirates GCL affiliate in 2010. At the end of August, Singh was promoted to the Pirates Class A Short-Season affiliate, the State College Spikes. He met with US President Barack Obama at a White House Heritage Month event on 24 May 2010. Singh played for the Canberra Cavalry of the Australian Baseball League for the competition's inaugural 2010–11 season, going 1–0 with a 3.94 ERA in 16 innings pitched.\nSingh opened the 2011 season in the Dominican Summer League. Singh pitched well in eight games spread over the DSL, Gulf Coast League, and New York–Penn League, then joined the West Virginia Power of the South Atlantic League in July 2011. Singh returned to the Australian Baseball League for the 2011–12 season with the Adelaide Bite. He made the World All-Star team for the 2011 Australian Baseball League All-Star Game. In 2012, he pitched in a career-high 39 games for the Power, throwing 72 innings, earning a 3–1 win–loss record and striking out 65 batters. Singh struggled with injuries and missed the entire 2013 season, but he was invited to 2014 spring training by the Pirates. Singh also missed the entire 2014 season due to Tommy John surgery. Singh also missed all of the 2015 season due to a broken elbow.\nThe Pirates re-signed Singh on 9 November 2015. He made one appearance for the rookie–level Gulf Coast League Pirates in 2016, pitching one scoreless inning. He elected free agency following the season on 7 November 2016.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nWWE (2018−2024).\nOn 14 January 2018, Singh signed a contract with WWE. On 25 March 2020 episode of \"NXT\", Singh, Saurav Gurjar, and manager Malcolm Bivens made their televised debut, attacking NXT Tag Team Champion Matt Riddle. The following week, Bivens introduced them as Rinku and Saurav, while revealing their team name to be Indus Sher (meaning Indian Tigers). On 8 April episode of \"NXT\", Indus Sher defeated Ever-Rise in their debut match. Indus Sher vanished from television after June. At Superstar Spectacle on 22 January 2021, Rinku and Saurav resurfaced and teamed with Drew McIntyre in a six-man tag-team match to defeat Jinder Mahal and The Bollywood Boyz.\nOn 10 May episode of \"Raw\", Singh, with the new ring name Veer, along with Shanky, would align themselves with Jinder Mahal. During the 2021 Draft, Mahal and Shanky were drafted to the SmackDown brand while Veer remained on the Raw brand, ending their alliance. Now a singles wrestler, Veer's ring name was tweaked to Veer Mahaan. After months of vignettes hyping his debut, Mahaan finally returned to television on 4 April 2022 episode of \"Raw\", attacking Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio. Mahaan would go on to defeat the Mysterios in separate matches.\nOn the 4 October episode of \"NXT\", Mahaan returned to the developmental brand, teasing a reunion with his former tag team partner Saurav, now known as Sanga. Mahaan returned to the main roster as he and Indus Sher were drafted to the Raw brand in the 2023 WWE Draft. On the March 18 2024 episode of \"Raw\", he and Sanga were defeated by Awesome Truth for a spot in the six-pack ladder match for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania XL. On the 05 April 2024 episode of \"Smackdown\", he appeared in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, where he was eliminated by the Creed Brothers. On 20 April 2024, Mahaan announced that he had been released by WWE, along with the rest of Indus Sher. \nFilm.\nSingh and Patel's story is the basis for the Walt Disney Pictures sports film \"Million Dollar Arm\", in which Singh was portrayed by Suraj Sharma. In 2009, Columbia Pictures purchased the screen rights to the story of Singh and Patel. The project stalled and eventually producers Joe Roth and Mark Ciardi set the film up at Walt Disney Pictures. Upon acquiring \"Million Dollar Arm\", Disney hired Tom McCarthy to write the film. Jon Hamm played J. B. Bernstein.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2012, Singh became a vegetarian after he witnessed several men in Bhadohi chasing a chicken in order to kill it. During his baseball career, he said that he recited the Hindu devotional hymn \"Hanuman Chalisa\" and listened to the Eminem song \"Not Afraid\" before pitching."

        "title": "National Collegiate Equestrian Association",
        "text": "The National Collegiate Equestrian Association (NCEA), formerly known as Varsity Equestrian, was created as the governing body for NCAA Equestrian teams. The NCEA is headquartered in Waco, Texas. Currently the NCEA has 24 official member colleges and universities that sponsor women's equestrian teams that participate in intercollegiate competition as a varsity sport. Some schools are further organized into conferences (ECAC, Big 12, SEC) while others are not. Most schools sponsor women's teams while two sponsor men's.\nThey began hosting a national championship in 2002. As membership has grown, they have begun to sponsor regional championships as well. They began hosting a Big 12 regional championship in 2009, a Southeastern Conference (SEC) regional championship in 2013, and a United Equestrian Conference (UEC) regional championship in 2015. In 2012 they began the NCEA Coach of the Year Award and in 2013 they began the team given NCEA Sportsmanship Award. In 2011 they began naming an NCEA All-American First Team for each section of competition, composed of the top four riders as selected by the NCEA selection committee. In that same year they also began to name All-American Honorable Mentions based on a set criteria where there is no limit as to how many can earn the award. In 2013 they began naming an NCEA All-American Second Team composed of the next top four riders as selected by the NCEA selection committee. In the 2013-14 season they began naming an NCEA All-Time Rider of the Month Award to one athlete from each section of competition during the regular season.\nIn 1998 the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Committee on Women's Athletics (CWA) identified Equestrian as an emerging sport for women in NCAA Divisions I and II. In September 2019, the CWA supported a proposal to add equestrian to the Emerging Sports for Women program in Division III. The proposal was submitted to Division III delegates at the NCAA Convention in January 2020, but was defeated 174-195.\nCompetition format.\nSchools organize season schedules that allow for head-to-head competitions resulting in ranking and seeding for conference and national titles. They compete during the fall semester from September to November and during the Spring semester from January to March. From March on there are post-season competitions. Home team schools can delegate the number of junior varsity riders that may accompany the varsity team to compete.\nHome teams provide the horses and appropriate equipment for them and the competition. Five horses are selected for each of the four events and coaches designate five of their riders to compete in each event for the English and Western components of the competition. A rider from each team is randomly paired and assigned to a horse for each event to compete in a \"head-to head\" match. Competitors are allowed to watch sanctioned warm-ups where horses are schooled for each of the four events. Riders are then given four minutes to practice on their assigned horse for each event. Riders competing in Equitation over Fences are allowed to take four practice fences within the four minutes of warm-ups.\nEach rider earns a score and the highest score on that horse wins the head-to-head match and scores a point for that team. Neither team receives the point if the two riders are given a tie score. If there is a tie in the overall competition, raw scores given by the judge are added up and used to determine the winner. In some cases, the lowest score from each team may be dropped.\nEquitation on the Flat (English Hunt Seat)\nRiders selected to compete in Equitation on the Flat demonstrate a predetermined test that is performed in a dressage arena measuring 20 meters by 40 meters. The riders must demonstrate a precise, well executed and accurate test while staying in correct position and maintaining a harmonious balance with the horse they've drawn to compete upon. Depending on the test selected by the home team, the judge can sit by letters B, C, or E. The home team may also choose if the horse and rider should enter the arena at letter A or along both of the long sides of the arena.\nTesting is judged on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning \"not performed\" and 10 marking \"excellent\". Riders will perform nine required movement, all scored using the defined scale based on accuracy and smoothness. The tenth score is judged using the same scale but is regarded to the riders overall position and correctness. The highest score a rider can receive is 100.\nEquitation over Fences (English Hunt Seat)\nRiders selected to compete in Equitation over Fences will show over a course of eight to ten fences set around 3' to 3'6\" in which the rider must successfully navigate the correct course while maintaining proper position. The rider should also be able to make the course look smooth by having consistent pace, consistent and correct distances to the jumps, and consistent striding between fences. The round is scored using a defined scale out of 100.\nHorsemanship (Western)\nIn horsemanship, the horse and rider perform a pattern in which different maneuvers and the horse's different gaits are exhibited. The base score for a pattern is 70, and the judge will score each of the 7–9 maneuvers anywhere from −1.5 to +1.5. The positive score indicates that a movement is above average in execution and the negative score deducts points for poor execution. Penalties are given if a horse kicks out, lopes on the wrong lead, or otherwise detracts from the uniformity of the performance. It is possible for a rider to receive a score of zero if mistakes such as going off-pattern (adding or subtracting elements from the original pattern) are made.\nReining (Western)\nUnlike horsemanship patterns, reining patterns include spins and sliding stops performed by the horse and rider. In reining, a score starts 70 and can be higher or lower depending on the quality of the ride. Riders perform movements that include: fast circles, slow circles, spins and sliding stops. Going off-pattern results in a score of zero. Over- or under-spinning by more than a quarter of a turn is also given a score of zero.\nVarsity equestrian teams.\nDivision I\nDivision II:\nConferences.\nThe conferences listed below host Conference Championship competitions for the Division I schools listed below. Big 12, ECAC and SEC are the only conferences involved with the NCEA Division I. Conference Championships take place between the end of the regular equestrian season and National Championships.\nEquestrian as an NCAA Emerging Sport.\nEquestrian has been on the list of Emerging Sports for Women by the NCAA since 2002. The Committee on Women's Athletics (CWA) oversees sports with the designation of being an Emerging Sport.\nThe NCAA states, \"Sports in the emerging sports program are expected to grow to 40 varsity teams within 10 years – the minimum level of sponsorship needed to be considered for the ultimate goal of becoming a full-fledged NCAA championship sport.\" Although the 10-year mark has been passed for equestrian, the sport remained on the list because of continued growth and support. However, it has faced several threats of removal from the list. In January 2016, some 200 college administrators voted for equestrian to continue in Division II at the NCAA Convention. Dr. Leah Holland Fiorentino has been integral in the fight for equestrian as a collegiate sport, as has Tom O'Mara.\nProgress.\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Sweet Briar would become the first Division III member of the NCEA.\nIt was announced in April 2018 by UC Davis that women's equestrian would become a varsity sport, and that it would be joining the NCEA.\nAt the 2018 NCEA Championships, the NCAA's Director of Inclusion, Amy Wilson, was in attendance. This was the first time an NCAA official attended the championships since the sport was added to the Emerging Sports list. The U.S. Equestrian Federation's CEO, Bill Moroney, was also on-hand.\nIn August 2019 it was announced that the University of Lynchburg and the State University of New York at New Paltz would be joining as Division III members in the 2019-2020 season.\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules and eligibility.\nAs a prospective athlete, students wishing to attend a Division I or II institution must be eligible before competing within collegiate athletics. \nOne form in specific that should be downloaded by the prospective athlete is called the \"Guide for the College Bound Student-Athlete\". There students will be able to look over the requirements more in depth. Most importantly, the student must still be an amateur to compete.\nCoaches may send out written contacts as of September 1 of the athlete's junior year but may not return phone calls prior to July 1 of the athlete's senior year. If an athlete is on an official visit they must be seniors, however, trips made at the athlete's personal expense may take place before their senior years. Each type of visit may not be during a dead period in schooling at the university."

        "text": "The Highlander Challenge World Championships (or more simply the Highlander Challenge or Gododdin Highlander Challenge) is a tournament that marries traditional Highland games with more contemporary strength athletics. It was created to help reinvigorate Highland games in Scotland by giving a modern and aspirational image while maintaining the tradition inherent in the history of the sport.\nHistory.\nHighland games has a long and distinguished history in Scotland. It was once claimed to be the biggest spectator sport in the country after football and as a format has been exported around the globe. In particular, it has been very successful in North America. However, in its native land, some well-informed commentators began to note that it was attracting small crowds, the format was deemed tired and the number of traditional heavy competitors was dwindling at once well-attended gatherings.\nDouglas Edmunds, the co-founder of the World's Strongest Man, but more pertinently a former world caber-tossing champion, determined to reinvigorate the sport in his native Scotland. Along with his son, Gregor Edmunds the 2007 winner of the World Highland Games Championships, he set about organizing a new competition that would attract some of the top names from the world from such disciplines as Highland games, strength athletics, powerlifting, and field athletics. He said \"Gimmicky strength events, like truck-pulling, we feel are inappropriate when Scotland has such a magnificent history ... Sadly, some games have poor quality athletes, bad equipment, and poor quality commentary with little crowd interaction. We aim to change that.\"\nThus was spawned the Highland Challenge. Invitees to the tournament had to meet high criteria, being either national champions, Olympians, world record-holders, World Highland Games champions, World's Strongest Man finalists, and US Highland Games champions. Having brought the earth of their homelands to the Moot Hill, in the same manner and place as allegiance was sworn to Scotland's ancient kings, contestants would enter a competition consisting of a mixture of traditional Highland games events and more contemporary strongman tests in order to vie for the title of the \"Chieftain's Champion\".\nThe 2007 event saw Sebastian Wenta win the competition and having sampled some success the next games were planned for 2008. Douglas Edmunds managed to attract a number of sponsors for the 2008 event, as well as gaining an agreement with Channel 4 to televise the event. The 2008 event took place at Scone on 19 and 20 July 2008. Such was its success that a 2009 event was planned for immediately.\nEvents.\nThe events contested are designed to echo not only the traditions of the Highland games but also the history of Scotland. They include wrestling, schiltron jousting, and stone-lifting, as well as traditional throws, such as the caber. In addition, there are re-enactments of battles including in 2008 the 1396 Battle of the North Inch starring Hal o' the Wynd.\nIn the 2008 contest. a new event called the \"whisky plunder\" (sponsored by Famous Grouse) saw competitors racing with four casks. Famous Grouse also sponsored the tossing the caber event, with winners toasting success with a Famous Grouse trophy and a personalised Gallon Bottle.\nPast winners.\nFinal.\nThe Highlander Challenge was to begin on 26 May 2007 at Blair Castle, Scotland. The games made up two half-hour episodes of the IFSA Strongman 26 programme television series. The event was also backed by Event Scotland and was conceived by Douglas Edmunds. It went by the name \"Gododdin Challenge\" in 2007. Sebastian Wenta edged out Gregor Edmunds by one-half-point for the victory at the Gododdin Challenge at Blair Castle. Hjalti Arnason who watched the contest commented that this made for TV event would result in excellent shows and Mike Zolkiewicz, who finished fourth said that the blend of traditional Highland games and strongman events \"had great balance and it tested athletic ability beyond just a Highland games or a strongman contest.\"\nThe final placings were:\n2008 Event.\nThe 2008 finals were on 19 and 20 July at Scone Palace. They were televised by Channel 4 and the announcer was Colin Bryce, an announcer on the World's Strongest Man as well as a past competitor.\nCompetitors.\nThere were also a number of competitors who had been advertised as entrants but for a variety of reasons had to pull out:\nHeat 1.\nThe competitors in the first heat were:\nChuprynin and Wenta dominated. Johannes Arsjo, in his first appearance in a Highland event won the whisky plunder (a 320-kg barrel carry) in a time of 14.28 seconds and overcame heavier and more experienced competitors to win the wrestling bouts.\nHeat 2.\nThe competitors in the second heat were:\nScott Rider was the overall winner, with winning throws in the stone putt and caber. David Barron winning the sheaf pitch and Sean Betz won the hammer with a throw of 139' 8½”.\nFinal.\nSean Betz won both the hammer and 28-lb weight for distance. Zijlstra won the Famous Grouse Challenge Caber and Arsjo beat Rider in the pole push. The 56-lb weight for height saw no-one reach 17' and was a three-way tie for first place between Arsjo, Wenta and Zijlstra. Going into the final event of the Pictish stone carry, Wenta had a 3-point lead over his closest challenger, Rider, but retained his title with by gaining a third place behind Edmunds and Arsjo.\nThe final placings were:\n2009 Event.\nThe 2009 finals were on 14 and 15 July 2009 at Glenarm Castle. The event was sponsored by Met-Rx. The event was overseen by the Earl of Antrim, who gave away the Devastator trophy.\n2011 event.\nThe finals of the 2011 Highlander Challenge took place on 17 &amp; 18 June 2011 at Glenarm Castle in Northern Ireland."

        "text": "Golf course turf is the grass covering golf courses, which is used as a playing surface in the sport of golf. The grass is carefully maintained by a greenskeeper to control weeds, insects and to introduce nutrients such as nitrogen fertilization. The grass is kept at a constant height by mowing.\nNutrient management.\nNitrogen application timing.\nNitrogen is the nutrient required in greatest amount by turfgrass. During an autumn season, rates of nitrogen (N) application should be lowered to consider previous application's residual available nitrate (NO) and mineralization (inorganic N), especially if there is substantial organic matter which releases its supply of sequestered N.\nIn the spring, heavy nitrogen applications for the first two months caused changes in color, but the nitrogen response by the grass was not maintained and a decrease in color was found as the growing season progressed. Spring fertilization can increase the tiller numbers of the grass compared to fall fertilization.\nIn the fall, application of nitrogen fertilizer caused improved color retention and early spring coloration. Year-to-year differences in nitrogen loss during the fall result from differences in temperature and precipitation. Lower levels of nitrogen loss during fall were found when it was warmer (more plant uptake) and dryer (less loss due to leaching).\nThe quality and color of turf will increase with nitrogen application amount. Both of the high rates created darker green turf throughout the duration of the experiment. There is a positive correlation between high levels of nitrogen fertilizer used on turf and turf quality for any level of wear.\nEnvironmental quality.\nGroundwater and air quality should be considered when applying fertilizer and pesticides to turf.\nFate of nitrogen.\nTurf growth at the time of nitrogen application affects nitrate (NO) leaching risk. For example, grass absorbed more N during active growth while uptake was limited in newly seeded turf. In another study, nitrogen applied after 15 September (of a northern-hemisphere autumn) caused relatively little plant growth, resulting in increased NO - N concentration in percolate water.\nAreas made of sod undergo greater leaching than seeded turf plots. They attributed these differences to less root development in sod which resulted in less uptake of N by the plants. They also found that deep- rather than shallow-rooted grasses absorbed nitrogen more effectively. Additionally, the authors found that nitrogen uptake for loamy sand was greater than a sandy loam because the turf rooting systems were denser in the loam sand.\nA highly soluble fertilizer, containing nitrogen in its nitrate form, such as ammonium nitrate, can create leaching three to seven times greater than United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits of (10 ppm) NO3-N during a time of ten to twenty-five days following nitrogen application. Hummel and Waddington, 2001, found that a slow release nitrogen fertilizer application could provide nitrogen over a long duration and keep nitrogen leaching and volatilization losses to a minimum. A further study demonstrated that after fertilizer application, nitrogen losses exceeded EPA limits.\nPhotoperiod (the length of daylight) affects overall plant uptake. When the length of daylight gets shorter, grass undergoes less photosynthesis and uptakes less nitrogen. To prepare the surface for the following year, high levels of nitrogen application need to be undertaken at the end of the growing season (such as the southern United States) and increase the risk of nitrate leaching. For example, greater water percolate concentrations of NO3 - N resulted from a late autumn application programme during a New England experiment."

In 1950, he won the first of his record five Calder Cup championships, and he received his first NHL promotion during the same year. He scored a career high 48 goals in 1951. Glover played 54 games with the Detroit Red Wings in 1951–52, but he was not active during the playoffs as the Wings won the Stanley Cup. Glover was traded to the Cleveland Barons in 1953, and he became the most celebrated player in team history. In fifteen seasons with Cleveland, he won four Calder Cups and three league MVP awards. He scored a career high 107 points in 1960. He retired in 1968 as the AHL's career leader in games played (1,201), goals (520), assists (814), points (1,334) and penalty minutes (2,402).\nCoaching career.\nBetween 1962 and 1968, Glover served a dual role as both star player and head coach. He won his 1964 championship while working in this capacity. He took a job as an NHL coach in 1968 as he joined the Oakland Seals. As a rookie coach, he was honored by \"The Sporting News\" as coach of the year, as he led his second year expansion franchise to a 22-point improvement over their initial season. However the team's performance diminished in each of the next two seasons, and he was fired three games into the 1971–72 campaign. Just weeks later, he became the first coach to manage two teams in one season, as he joined the Los Angeles Kings and finished out their season after the franchise had fired coach Larry Regan. He returned to the Seals in 1972 as a mid-season replacement, coaching the team to a last place finish, before being fired during the next season."

He is 5'11\" and weighs 160 lbs.\nCareer.\nOn July 16, 2001, Santana appeared in the only game of his MLB career. He entered the game in the eighth inning as a defensive replacement at second base in place of Damion Easley and batting second in the lineup. The Tigers, who were losing to the Cincinnati Reds 9–1, batted the number four, five, six, and seven hitters in the top of the ninth inning to close out the game. Santana finished the game without a plate appearance, although he did record a putout of Reds second basemen Juan Castro to close out the eighth inning. This puts Santana in select company with other non-pitchers who appeared in a major league game but did not receive a plate appearance, such as Moonlight Graham. Santana was originally called up on July 13 when the Tigers put starting third baseman Dean Palmer on the disabled list; and was sent back down to the minors when the team activated starting shortstop Deivi Cruz on July 18.\nSantana's brief appearance was notable, as the game took place in July, as opposed to later in the season when rosters expand during September call-ups. Santana was not called up that September, despite remaining on the 40-man roster."

The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 1–0. It is the only All-Star Game played without a run batted in (RBI).\nThis was the first night All-Star Game since 1944.

In the ninth, with two out, Jerry Koosman was brought in from the bullpen to face Carl Yastrzemski, whose strikeout ended the game."

        "title": "Midnight Madness (basketball)",
        "text": "Midnight Madness is an annual event celebrating the upcoming college basketball season in which a team opens its first official practice to the public, often combining it with a pep rally and other fan-friendly activities. The tradition originated from teams holding public practices at midnight on the earliest day that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) would allow a practice to be held. In 2013, a new NCAA rule established some flexibility around the opening of a team's practice sessions. As a result, the dates on which teams celebrate Midnight Madness can vary, but most stick with the traditional date of a Friday night closest to October 15.\nHistory.\nPrior to the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season men's and women's basketball teams were not permitted to practice prior to the Friday closest to October 15. Maryland Terrapins head coach Lefty Driesell began the Midnight Madness tradition at 12:03 a.m. on October 15, 1971 by inviting the public to a 1.5 mile team run. The early practice session was attended by 3,000 fans at the track surrounding Byrd Stadium on the University of Maryland campus. Driesell continued the annual midnight practice session throughout his tenure at Maryland, and brought the tradition with him when he became head coach at Georgia State University. In 2008, that school delayed the event until sunrise for the first time since Driesell established the tradition.\nIn 1982, coach Joe B. Hall and the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team began to officially promote a celebration dubbed \"Midnight Madness\" as a school event with formal entertainment acts and an invited student audience. This event was held in Memorial Coliseum and held 8,500 people in the then-12,500 seat gym. Big Blue Madness is now televised and hosts celebrities including Drake, who performed in 2014. Another of the more famous events is \"Late Night in the Phog\" at Kansas, which was started in 1985 by Larry Brown and is now broadcast in live streaming video via the Internet. The event has caught on on most campuses; various programs have given away T-shirts and allowed players do stunt dunks and half court shots. Some schools schedule intrasquad scrimmages, three-point shooting contests and/or slam dunk contests. The event is often a co-ed event, in which both the men's and women's teams participate in the celebration, especially at schools like the University of Connecticut, where the men's and women's teams have a combined 15 championships. \"Scout.com\" estimated that in 2007, approximately 160 of the top blue chip high school basketball recruits in the country were attending a Midnight Madness event during the weekend that opens the basketball season.\nIn 2013, the NCAA ruled that men's practices could begin two weeks earlier than the traditional date, so long as teams held no more than 30 days of practice in the six weeks prior to the first regular-season game. This change was made to provide more flexible scheduling that accommodated off days in the preseason practice schedule. However, the women's programs rejected moving the date forward so as not to conflict with recruiting. As a result of practices beginning so early, several teams opted to celebrate Midnight Madness later in the six-week practice window.\nDetails.\nIn the 21st century, most basketball programs from large Division I schools have planned a pep rally with MCs, music, dancing and other festivities to encourage support of the program. Celebrity guests and alumni participate in entertaining the students. Often, there is significant publicity surrounding the event, which may include televised broadcasts, published press releases and various new media exposure.\nSome of the more outlandish occurrences during such events included coach participation, such as Michigan State Spartans men's basketball coach Tom Izzo riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the court and Florida Gators men's basketball coach Billy Donovan rising out of a coffin. Although signing week, when top recruits sign letters of intent that commit them to specific schools, does not occur until November, blue chip high school recruits are sometimes welcomed at these events even in their junior years. Usually a prescribed number of fans (such as the first 1,000) receive a gifts such as t-shirts, posters, autographs, road game vacation packages, and other free paraphernalia. At many such events, a student is chosen for a half-court shot giveaway. Sometimes the events are televised live by sports networks such as the Big Ten Network, and other times highlights are shown on highlight shows such as ESPN's \"SportsCenter\". ESPNU has begun extensive yearly coverage of midnight madness events and in 2008 televised events at Davidson College, the University of Kansas, Georgetown University, Gonzaga University and Indiana University. The events have been reported for years in print media such as newspapers, magazines and the internet. Although Midnight Madness has become a prime time event for many premier basketball programs, some schools have continued the tradition of having their first practice at 12:00 on the first day regular practice is allowed.\nAs of 2006, the University of Kentucky held the record for attendance at this type of sports rally with an attendance of 23,312 at Rupp Arena. Kentucky has sold out Rupp Arena multiple times for what they call \"Big Blue Madness\" and in the 2008–09 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball season fans had to camp out in lines for days in advance to obtain tickets.\nOne celebratory function of the evening is often to raise NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament or Final Four banners to the rafters in an official ceremony. In 2008, both 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament finalists, the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball and Memphis Tigers men's basketball teams, did so during their respective Midnight Madness event. The October 16, 2009 celebrations occurred on many campuses and a sampling were aired on the ESPN family of networks. Five Big Ten Conference schools celebrated Midnight Madness.\nExceptions.\nIn 2008, some teams attempted to host Midnight Madness in association with special early restricted practices instead of the first day of regular practices. These universities felt that since their football teams had home games the week before the opening date of formal practices, which had become the traditional Midnight Madness date, they would be better off holding Midnight Madness on the weekend before. In 2008, teams were allowed to practice two hours per week between September 15 and October 17 under what is known as the \"Offseason Workout Rule,\" and at least four notable public \"practice\" sessions (by Illinois, Kentucky, Marshall and West Virginia) were held during these weekly practices before daily practices were permitted. At the University of Illinois, the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball and women's basketball teams hosted scrimmages at Memorial Stadium after an October 11 game between the Illinois Fighting Illini football team and the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team. Since the attendance for the football game was 62,870, this event was described as the \"World's Largest Basketball Practice\". Charlie Zegers reports that the practice session events occurred both at halftime and after the game.\nKentucky was one of the schools that held their public practice event a week early in part because they could lure more recruiting prospects during a week when most other programs were not hosting similar events. The National Association of Basketball Coaches asked the Southeastern Conference to force Kentucky to adhere to the traditionally scheduled practice to no avail. They then belatedly petitioned the NCAA to legislate conformity unsuccessfully. Kentucky coach Billy Gillispie had contacted the Kentucky's compliance office, the SEC and the NCAA to ensure that no rules were being violated.\nIllinois head coach Bruce Weber had also received permission for the early practice festivities from the NCAA. He had proposed having a September 13 session in association with a home football game against Louisiana–Lafayette. The date with the Ragin' Cajuns would have in all likelihood been a more favorable day in terms of the climate, but this date preceded even the Offseason Workout Rule dates. It is anticipated that in the future, public basketball practices linked to the Offseason Workout Rule will be banned. Illinois claimed that their date change was not intended to give it a recruiting advantage in terms of scheduling conflicts."

        "text": "Clifton Davies (12 December 1919 – 28 January 1967) was a Welsh international prop who played club rugby for Cardiff and invitational rugby for the Barbarians. He won 16 caps for Wales and was selected to play in the British Lions on the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand.\nDavies was a short, tough prop forward, who was also known within rugby circles for his cheery demeanor and baritone singing voice.\nRugby career.\nDavies began his rugby career with local club Kenfig Hill before moving to Bridgend. After the war, Davies was persuaded to join first tier club, Cardiff, by Jack Matthews and joined the Blues in the 1945/46 season. Davies made his international debut for Wales during the 1947 Five Nations Championship, when he was selected to face Scotland at Murrayfield. Under the captaincy of Haydn Tanner, Wales beat the Scottish team convincingly and Davies secured his position in the team for the rest of the season. In his second game for Wales, Davies was involved in a memorable match against France at Stade Colombes. In a bruising encounter, Davies bit the ear of French prop Jean Princlary in the scrum, after the Frenchman's continual harassment of Billy Gore, the Welsh hooker. The Welsh team were happy to win the game by a single drop goal.\nDuring the 1947/48 season, Davies was part of one of the strongest Cardiff teams in the club's history. Out of 41 games, Cardiff lost just two, to Pontypool and Penarth, and also beat the touring Australians. Davies was also picked to face the Australians for Wales, which saw the Welsh team win through two penalty goals from Bill Tamplin. Davies played for all four matches of the 1948 Five Nations Championship, though after a draw against England and a win over Scotland, Davies experienced his first international loss when Wales were beaten by both France and Ireland. The 1949 season was a poor one for Davies, as he was picked for only one game of the tournament in another loss to the French.\n1950 was a far better year for Davies, which cemented his position as one of the truly great Welsh props. Davies played in all four of the 1950 Championship which saw Wales win their first Grand Slam since 1911. The Welsh pack included two inexperienced players, David Davies and John Robins, and it was Cliff who steadied the Welsh pack, allowing his hooker to win key possession in the scrums. In the opening game against England, Davies also scored his only international points, finishing off a Lewis Jones run to score a try at Twickenham to give Wales the victory. That year he was chosen for the British Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, and although playing in only one test, he was a popular character who kept up team morale.\nDavies' played in the first three opening games of the 1951 Championship, but was dropped after a draw against Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park. Davies then faced his final major touring team, when he was part of the Cardiff team that faced the touring South Africa team. It was a close match which Cardiff lost 11–9. Davies played particularly well in the front row, but when he turned up from working down the mine he was unshaven and used his stubble against the South African prop, Jaap Bekker in the scrum. After rubbing the side of Bekker's face raw, Bekker warned Davies to stop, or he would bite him. Davies did not stop, and Bekker responded by biting a piece out of Davies' ear which caused a heavy bleed.\nDavies retired from first class rugby in 1952.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nBritish Lions"

Mark Webster was the defending men's champion having won the title for the first time in the 2008 final against Simon Whitlock, but he was eliminated 4–0 by John Walton in the second round. The title was eventually won by 2000 champion Ted Hankey, who won 7–6 against Tony O'Shea, in a match which lasted just under two and a half hours. The defending women's champion, Anastasia Dobromyslova, was due to defend her championship, having beaten seven-time champion Trina Gulliver in the 2008 final, but on 7 December 2008 she resigned from the BDO/WDF setup after her defeat in the Winmau World Masters to Francis Hoenselaar. It later emerged that she had accepted the 70th and last place into the rival PDC World Championship, replacing an Indian qualifier. This meant that for the first time, the defending women's champion would not be returning to defend her title. Hoenselaar, a five-time runner-up, won her first world title by beating Gulliver – the player that had beaten her each time – by two sets to one. The event took place from 3–11 January 2009 and for the 24th time, the tournament took place at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nMen's.\nThe televised stages featured 32 players.

He won only three caps for Wales but captained the squad for one match during the first years of international rugby.\nRugby career.\nAlthough born in England, there were few rules regarding nationality in the early period of national rugby, and when in 1884, in a game against England, Frank Purdon withdrew in the morning before the game and Simpson was selected to take his place. The game took place at Cardigan Fields in Leeds, which a disappointing crowd of only 2,000 witnessed, and though Wales lost Simpson was reselected for the remaining two games of the 1884 Home Nations Championship. Wales lost again in the second game of the tournament against Scotland, but in the final match of the competition, in a home game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Simpson was given the captaincy. This was Simpson's last game but it resulted in a Welsh win with tries from Tom Clapp and William Norton. The 1884 match against Ireland which Simpson captained is often remembered because Ireland arrived two players short, and Wales supplied them with two replacements, both of whom became dual nationals as they also represented Wales.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "1965 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1965 Rose Bowl, played on January 1, 1965, was the 51st Rose Bowl Game. The Michigan Wolverines defeated the Oregon State Beavers by a score of 34–7. Michigan fullback Mel Anthony was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game.\nTeams.\nMichigan.\nThe Wolverines had finished seventh in the Big Ten Conference the previous year, and had placed no higher than a tie for fifth under coach Bump Elliott. Michigan had not been to the Rose Bowl since 1951, but in 1964, they ran up an 8–1 conference record and clinched a Rose Bowl berth, taking a #4 ranking and an undefeated 3–0 postseason record into the game. Coach Elliott had been a receiver for the Wolverines in one of those games, the 1948 Rose Bowl, and had been an assistant coach at Oregon State under head coach Kip Taylor.\nOregon State.\nThe Beavers made their third Rose Bowl appearance with a bit of controversy. Following the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference in 1959 due to a pay-for-play scandal, the reformed Athletic Association of Western Universities did not initially include Oregon State and Oregon. The two Oregon schools rejoined in time for the 1964 season, but the conference did not have time to reschedule a full head-to-head conference schedule. As a result, Oregon State and USC did not play each other, and when they finished with identical 3–1 conference records, the decision of which team to send to Pasadena was left to a vote among the conference's schools. At first, most people assumed Oregon State would get the nod based on their better overall record (8–2 vs. 6–3). However, when it was announced that the vote would be delayed until after USC's season ending game with top ranked and undefeated Notre Dame, many people inferred that if USC upset the Irish, they would get the nod. Indeed, USC shocked Notre Dame 20–17 so now many people assumed USC would get the Rose Bowl invitation. When the vote was taken just hours after the USC - Notre Dame game, the conferences' eight members split, four votes for both Oregon State and USC. The tiebreaker in such an instance was to eliminate the team that had more recently gone to the Rose Bowl, and Southern California had gone two years prior.\nThis would lead to another controversy just two years later in which an 8–2 USC team that had lost to UCLA would get voted in ahead of the 9–1 Bruins. Many felt this 1966 vote was to \"make up for\" the 1964 vote, especially since the coach of Oregon State in 1964 was Tommy Prothro and he was then the coach of UCLA in 1966.\nGame summary.\nMichigan was an 11-point favorite, but after a scoreless first quarter, it was the Beavers who struck first, with Paul Brothers completing a five-yard pass to Doug McDougal early in the second quarter, with Steve Clark kicking the extra point. The Beavers held the Wolverines for a while, but on their third possession following the Beavers' score, tailback Mel Anthony ran 84 yards, a Rose Bowl record at the time, for a touchdown. Richard Sygar's kick was no good. The Beavers' 7–6 advantage was short-lived, however, as on the very next possession, Carl Ward ran for 43 yards and a touchdown. While the conversion pass from Bob Timberlake to Ben Farabee was broken up, the Wolverines led 12–7 at the half.\nThe second half was all Michigan. Anthony blocked a punt and rushed for two more touchdowns in the third quarter, and quarterback Timberlake ran 24 yards for the final touchdown, making the final score 34–7. For his efforts, Anthony was named the game's Most Outstanding Player.\nScoring.\nFirst quarter.\nNone.\nAftermath.\nWith the game, Michigan ended its 14-year postseason drought, to date their longest string of seasons without a bowl game. However, it was the last bowl game Elliott would coach; he resigned following the 1968 season after a 50–14 loss to archrival Ohio State.\nThis was the Beavers' last bowl game appearance for 34 years, and to date, remains their last appearance in the Rose Bowl. Soon after the game, Beaver coach Tommy Prothro left Oregon State to coach UCLA, and took them to the following year's Rose Bowl, in which the Bruins defeated Michigan State."

The Cardinals competed in the Big East Conference and were coached by Rick Pitino, who was in his eighth season. The team played its home games at Freedom Hall.\nThe Cardinals finished the season 31–6, 16–2 and were regular season Big East Champions (their 1st). They defeated Syracuse 76–66 to win the 2009 Big East men's basketball tournament (their 1st). They received an automatic bid to the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, earning the overall #1 seed and were placed in the Midwest Region. They were upset by #2 seed Michigan State in the Midwest Regional final, 64–52.\nPreseason.\nAfter an elite eight appearance in the 2008 tournament, Louisville entered the 2008–09 season ranked third in both the AP and Coaches polls in part due to a strong recruiting class. The incoming freshman class is ranked fifth overall by Scouts.com, led by number one ranked center Samardo Samuels. Louisville has been picked by many analysts to be a potential Final Four contender, including Sports Illustrated and Dick Vitale.\nRegular season.\nDespite the #3 preseason ranking, Louisville struggled in the non-conference losing to three unranked opponents. After beating Kentucky on an Edgar Sosa buzzer-beating three pointer, Louisville entered Big East play ranked #21. After beating South Florida easily, Louisville beat three straight ranked teams in close games: #17 Villanova, #12 Notre Dame in overtime, and previously unbeaten #1 Pittsburgh. Louisville would continue strong play, going undefeated in January and winning its first eight conference games before losing to #1 Connecticut on February 2. After beating St. John's, Louisville lost by their most lopsided margin since joining the Big East, a 33-point drubbing by Notre Dame. After that game, Louisville won its final seven regular season games to win the school's first ever regular season Big East championship.\nBig East tournament.\nBy virtue of their outright regular-season title, Louisville received a double-bye in the Big East tournament and played their first game in the tournament quarterfinals. In the tournament, Louisville beat Providence 73–55 in the quarterfinals and #10 Villanova 69–55 in the semifinals to advance to the school's first ever Big East tournament championship game in four seasons in the conference. In the finals, Louisville won its first Big East tournament Championship, defeating #18 Syracuse 76–66. Due to losses in the early conference tournament rounds by several teams above them, the Cardinals finished #1 in the final regular season AP and coaches' polls—the first time in school history they have been ranked #1 in either poll.\nNCAA tournament.\nLouisville was awarded the top seed in the NCAA tournament Midwest Region, as well as the overall #1 seed in the tournament. This is Louisville's second ever 1-seed. The Cardinals beat Morehead St. and Siena in the first two tournament rounds, advancing to face Arizona in the Sweet 16 on March 27.

He represented Canterbury in domestic cricket, having debuted for them in the 1923/24 Plunket Shield. In the 1925/26 season he was a member of the New Zealand side which toured Australia and he made half-centuries against Victoria and South Australia. He also toured the British Isles in 1927 with the national side. He claimed the only wicket of his first-class career during this tour, that of Sussex bowler Reginald Hollingdale.\nNew Zealand didn't gain Test status in cricket until 1930, by which time Oliver had decided to focus on his rugby, thus missing out on a chance to become a Test 'double international'. He continued to play senior club cricket in Christchurch, leading the competition's batting in the 1934–35 season with 972 runs and setting a record with five centuries.\nRugby career.\nOliver's early rugby had been played with Merivale before he made his way into the Canterbury side. He toured Australia in 1929 and made his Test debut for the All Blacks in a match against Australia at Sydney, aged 23.

        "title": "College Basketball on CBS Sports",
        "text": "College Basketball on CBS Sports (usually referred to on-air as the Road to the Final Four, or simply the NCAA on CBS) is the branding used for broadcasts of men's NCAA Division I basketball games that are produced by CBS Sports, for CBS, CBSSN, and Facebook.\nFrom 1982 to 2015, CBS Sports obtained broadcast television rights to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, replacing NBC which had been airing the game since 1969. Beginning in the 2016 season, TBS has held the rights to broadcast the NCAA Division I Championship in Men's Basketball in even-numbered years, while CBS continues to air the game in odd-numbered years.\nIn addition, CBS Sports currently holds broadcasting rights to conference regular season games including the American Athletic Conference, Atlantic 10 Conference, Big 12 Conference, Big East Conference, Big Ten Conference, Conference USA, Colonial Athletic Association, Mid-American Conference, Missouri Valley Conference, Mountain West Conference, Pac-12 Conference, Patriot League, Southeastern Conference, Southern Conference, and West Coast Conference.\nHistory.\nNIT (1966–1975).\nFrom 1966 to 1975, CBS provided national television coverage for selected games from the National Invitation Tournament. Before 1975, the NCAA only allowed one team per conference to play in the NCAA tournament. Therefore, the NIT got many top teams and was considered somewhat comparable in quality to the NCAA Tournament.\nIn the early part of this era (circa 1966–1968), CBS carried one game on the opening Saturday and the championship game the following Saturday. By 1969, CBS moved their first round coverage from Saturday to Sunday to avoid conflicting with the NCAA tournament coverage on NBC. In the process, the NIT title game went head-to-head with the NCAA consolation game. The same would be true on both counts for the next three years.\nIn 1973, CBS expanded their NIT coverage to four games. The March 17 Notre Dame vs. USC game went up against an NCAA Tournament game on NBC. Meanwhile, the March 24 Notre Dame vs. North Carolina game went up against the first NCAA Final Four game.\nIn 1974, CBS went from covering four to covering five games in the NIT. The March 16 doubleheader Maryland Eastern Shore vs. Manhattan and Purdue vs. North Carolina went up against the 1974 NCAA tournament on NBC. Meanwhile, the March 23 doubleheader Purdue vs. Jacksonville and Utah vs. Boston College went head-to-head against the NCAA Final Four.\nIn 1975, CBS did not cover any NIT games on the first weekend, but did carry the semifinals and finals. The March 22 doubleheader Providence vs. St. John's and Princeton vs. Oregon went head-to-head with the NCAA tournament.\n1980s.\nBesides being their first year covering the NCAA tournament, 1982 also marked the first year that the NCAA selection show was broadcast on television.\nFor their inaugural season, CBS had to scramble to arrange a regular season schedule as NBC still held exclusive rights to certain collegiate conferences. CBS also signed Billy Packer away from NBC to be its top analyst (teaming with play-by-play announcer Gary Bender, and later Brent Musburger and Jim Nantz). Packer also played a key role in helping CBS put together its schedule. In the 1981–82 season, CBS did however, happen to obtain contracts with the Metro and Missouri Valley Conferences. During the 1982 NCAA tournament, CBS introduced 11:30 p.m. (Eastern Time Zone) games on Thursday and Friday nights for the first two weekends.\nCBS also aired an NBA game in the noon timeslot on Sunday, March 14 while only showing a doubleheader of NCAA games. During the telecast of the March 14, 1982 Idaho vs. Iowa game, Fred White started the game on play-by-play with Irv Brown as analyst, but White came down with laryngitis a few minutes into the game. So Brown shifted to play-by-play (for the first time ever) and Washington State head coach George Raveling came out of the stands to serve as analyst for the remainder of the game.\nTom Brookshier, who was a play-by-play broadcaster for the \"NFL on CBS\" at the time, became the subject of controversy because of a remark he made during a Philadelphia Eagles vs. New Orleans Saints game broadcast on December 11, 1983. After a program note for an upcoming telecast of an NCAA men's basketball game involving the Louisville Cardinals, Brookshier said that the players on the Louisville team had \"a collective I.Q. of about 40\". This resulted in Neal Pilson, then president of CBS Sports, apologizing to Louisville school officials and later suspending Brookshier for the last weekend of the NFL regular season. Louisville's athletic director, Bill Olsen, felt that the remark was racism, since Louisville's starting five were all African Americans. Brookshier later apologized, calling his remark \"stupid\" and \"dumb,\" but was angered over CBS' reaction, saying \"I'm not about to be judged on one comment.\" He added, \"I've done a lot of things for charity. Now my own network is bailing out on me and taking me off the air. After 20 years at CBS, I deserve better than this.\" The apology was accepted by the university, as its president, Donald Swain, invited Brookshier to be the featured speaker at the school's annual football kickoff luncheon in Clarksville, Indiana on August 2, 1984. Brookshier was reinstated in CBS's announcing lineup for the 1984 NFL season, continuing as a network commentator through the 1987 NFL season.\nFor the 1984 NCAA tournament, CBS expanded its coverage on the first Sunday to a triple header. In areas which received the March 23 Wake Forest vs. DePaul game (most of the nation), CBS joined the Georgetown vs. UNLV game in progress (although some stations may have aired a syndicated program at 11:30 and carried the Georgetown vs. UNLV game in its entirety at midnight) around 1:30 a.m. ESPN re-aired the CBS feed of the Georgetown-UNLV game at 2:30 am.\nThe 1985 NCAA tournament marked the first year that CBS had aired a regional semifinal tournament doubleheader, leaving ESPN with only one live game on each of these nights. Also that year, Brent Musburger took over from Gary Bender in the top CBS play-by-play role (but worked in the studio on the first weekend). Meanwhile, Pat Summerall made a return to basketball play-by-play during the tournament after having not worked any basketball games since the 1974 NBA playoffs). Summerall called second-round tournament games in Atlanta alongside Larry Conley.\nIn the 1986 NCAA tournament, Jim Nantz made his NCAA tournament play-by-play debut, calling second-round games in Greensboro with Bill Raftery. Back on January 18, Nantz did play-by-play on his first college basketball game for CBS, a regional telecast between Arizona and Miami. One year later, CBS started using Nantz as the studio host for the NCAA tournament.\nThe 1987 NCAA tournament marked the first year that CBS used the song \"One Shining Moment\" for its tournament epilogue. 1987 was the last year that CBS aired an NCAA tournament game on broadcast delay (Syracuse vs. Florida from East Rutherford on March 19 at 11:30 p.m. Eastern time; the actual tip-off time was 6:30 p.m.). 1987 would also prove to be the last time that CBS used its #1 announce team (in this case, Brent Musburger and Billy Packer) on two regional finals. Musburger and Packer called the Syracuse vs. North Carolina game in East Rutherford) and Indiana vs. LSU game in Cincinnati.\n1988 was the first year that CBS televised all regional semifinals. In these years, CBS only came on the air for basketball at 7:30 p.m. ET for basketball in the regions which got the 7:30 game. In essence, most of the country was \"in the dark\" until 8 p.m. This was also the first year that CBS moved the Final Four games to 5:30 p.m. ET. CBS used \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Curry Kirkpatrick as an analyst for the second round. Kirkpatrick teamed with Tim Ryan on the second-round games in Atlanta.\n1990s.\nFor the 1990 NCAA tournament, CBS expanded its coverage on the first Saturday to show a quadruple header. This particular tournament also marked Brent Musburger's last assignment for CBS. Although Musburger was fired on April Fools' Day (which fell on the Sunday of Final Four weekend that year), he still did play-by-play for the championship game. As previously mentioned, Musburger had done play-by-play (although he worked in the studio for the first weekends) for CBS' coverage of the Final Four since 1985.\nDuring the 1990–91 season, CBS' February 10, 1991 broadcast of a game between UNLV and Arkansas (which, respectively, were the No. 1 and No. 2 college basketball teams in the nation at the time) drew the highest Nielsen ratings for a regular season college basketball game since 1985.\nIn the 1991 NCAA tournament, CBS assumed responsibility for covering all games of the NCAA tournament, with the exception of the single Tuesday night \"play-in\" game (the play-in game – between teams ranked as No. 64 and No. 65 seeds – is televised by ESPN, except for the first one, which was aired on then-CBS owned cable channel Paramount Network, and used CBS graphics and announcers). For the evening sessions in the first round, CBS only came on the air at 7:30 p.m. for basketball games in the regions which received a 7:30 game broadcast. Otherwise, most of the country was \"in the dark\" until 8:00 p.m. 1991 was also the first year that the Saturday regional finals started at 3:30 p.m.\nThe 1992 NCAA tournament also featured the return of Al McGuire to NCAA tournament commentary for the first time since 1981 (NBC's final year broadcasting the tournament). McGuire wasn't sure he could handle four games on the first round, so CBS used Greg Kelser for the afternoon session in Milwaukee alongside Dick Stockton. Meanwhile, this year, CBS again used Jim Nantz and Billy Packer in the studio for the first weekend. It was during the 1992 tournament that CBS televised the now legendary East Regional Final between Duke and Kentucky. With Verne Lundquist and Len Elmore on commentary, this game has since been seen by many as the single greatest college basketball game ever played.\nIn 1993, CBS adopted their current theme, which has been used in variations ever since (the first update coming in 2004). This year, CBS kept Nantz in the studio for the first weekend of the 1993 NCAA tournament, but used Packer on games with a different play-by-play partner (such as James Brown, and subsequently, and Dick Stockton, Bob Rathbun, and Bob Carpenter). CBS would continue this practice until 1998.\nThe 1995 tournament was the first year that CBS moved the Sunday regional finals to 2:30 p.m. During the 1995–96 season, CBS used a \"wheel\" concept on selected days, using a set of games with start times that were usually staggered by one hour. For example, CBS might have a game starting at 2:00 p.m., another one at 3:00 p.m., and a third one at 4:00 p.m. Some areas of the country would see the 2:00 p.m. game, then join the middle game in progress around 4:00 p.m. (likely seeing the second half only), and then join the late game in progress around 5:00 p.m. Other areas might see the first half of the 2:00 p.m. game, then see the entire 3:00 p.m. game and then join the late game in progress. CBS would periodically use this concept the next few seasons as well. It would influence how the 2011 selection show was conducted in terms of start times, except by that time, four different networks would be airing games.\n1996 was the first NCAA tournament on which Gus Johnson called play-by-play for CBS. Johnson worked with Quinn Buckner on first and second-round games in Indianapolis.\nJim Nantz came down with laryngitis during the January 17, 1998 game between UCLA and Stanford game and sat out on January 18, where Billy Packer was scheduled to work New Mexico at Arizona. CBS had no games on the weekend of February 14 as it was CBS Olympic broadcasts the 1998 Winter Olympics.\nWith the 1998 tournament, CBS started using the team of Jim Nantz and Billy Packer to call games the first weekend. The previous several years, Nantz worked the studio on the first weekend (as was the case with his predecessor, Brent Musburger) while Packer called games with various partners. 1998 also marked first tournament appearance for Ian Eagle, who teamed with Jim Spanarkel in early round games in Sacramento.\n1999 served as the first year of the DirecTV Mega March Madness package. This was also the first year that Kevin Harlan called the NCAA tournament and the last year for Al McGuire. Harlan called first-round games in Seattle alongside Jon Sundvold. Meanwhile, McGuire's final tournament game for CBS was the regional final between Duke and Temple at East Rutherford. McGuire worked alongside Verne Lundquist during the 1999 tournament.\n2000s.\nIn 1999, CBS began broadcasting its coverage of the Final Four in high-definition television. From 2000 to 2004, only one first- or second-round site and one regional site were designated as sites for the high definition broadcasts. In 2005, all regional games were broadcast in HD, and four first- and second-round sites were designated for HD coverage. Local stations broadcasting in both digital television and analog television had the option of airing separate games on their high definition and standard-definition television channels, to take advantage of the available HD coverage.\n2000 marked the return of Dick Enberg to NCAA tournament play-by-play after 19 years. Enberg was paired with James Worthy in 2000, Bill Walton in 2001, Matt Goukas from 2002 to 2004, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar along with Goukas in 2004, and Jay Bilas beginning in 2005. This was also the first year that CBS moved the Saturday regional final to 4:30 p.m. ET.\nIn 2001, CBS assigned the team of Jim Nantz and Billy Packer to a Thursday/Saturday tournament regional for the first time ever. Also in 2001, the NCAA expanded the tournament to 65 teams and created a Tuesday night \"play-in\" game on TNN (which was called by Tim Brando and Rick Pitino from Dayton). 2002 had CBS broadcast the Saturday second round quadrupleheader at 1:00 p.m. and the Final Four to 6:00 p.m. for the first time. By this time however, the \"play-in\" game moved to ESPN (this time called by Mike Tirico and Len Elmore). \nOn March 20 and 21, 2003, CBS provided Iraq War coverage during the afternoon sessions. As a result, ESPN carried the tournament games using CBS announcers. This also led CBS to expand to a quadruple header for its Sunday game broadcasts on March 23. Also in 2003, CBS struck a deal with Yahoo! to offer live streaming of the first three rounds of the tournament through its Yahoo! Platinum service, for $16.95 a month.\nFor 2004, CBS assigned Jim Nantz and Billy Packer to a Thursday through Saturday regional for the third time in four years. This was also the only year that Nantz and Packer worked Thursday through Saturday tournament games on each of the first two weekends. That year, CBS sold access to \"March Madness On Demand\" for US$9.95, which provided games not otherwise shown on broadcast television. The service was available for free to AOL subscribers. In 2005, the service charged US$19.95 for a subscription, but offered enhanced coverage of pregame and postgame interviews and press conference.\nIn 2006, \"March Madness On Demand\" was available free of charge, but dropped the coverage of interviews and press conferences. The service was profitable and set a record for simultaneous online streams at 268,000. \"March Madness On Demand\" has been available free to online users in all subsequent years.\nIn addition, College Sports Television (later CBS College Sports Network, now CBS Sports Network) broadcast two \"late early\" games that would not otherwise be broadcast nationally. These were the second games in the daytime session in the Pacific Time Zone, to avoid starting games before 10:00 a.m. These games are also available via \"March Madness on Demand\" and on CBS affiliates in the market areas of the teams playing. In most markets, stations break between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time for regular late afternoon programming, which consists of local newscasts and the \"CBS Evening News\", as well as any other syndicated programming such as \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". In areas where \"The Price Is Right\" was pre-empted for basketball, the game show aired within this window. CSTV also broadcast the official pregame and postgame shows and press conferences from the teams involved.\nBeginning in 2007, all games in the tournament (including all first and second-round games) were available in high definition, and local stations were required to air the same game on both their analog and digital channels. However, due to satellite limitations, first round \"constant\" feeds were only available in standard definition. Some stations that operate digital television chose not to televise high-definition broadcasts of the first and second rounds and the regional semifinals, and split their signal into digital subchannel to show all games going on simultaneously. Most notably, WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina provided four separate feeds on its digital signal from 2000 to 2010 in order to show all of the games.\nAlso in 2007, CBS broadcast all games from each regional site in high definition, however, due to limitations in the CBS Broadcast Center, only the \"Flex\" feeds were available in HD, constant feeds were in standard definition. Upgrades at the CBS Broadcast Center allowed all feeds, flex and constant, to be presented in high definition for the 2008 tournament. Meanwhile, James Brown returned to NCAA tournament play-by-play for the first time since 1994. Brown however drew very negative reviews for his performance. Consequently, CBS would not use Brown on play-by-play for the 2008 tournament. CBS also aired one first-round game each day on CSTV.\nFor 2008, CBS moved the Saturday regional final doubleheader to 6:30 p.m. 2008 also marked the last NCAA tournament in which Billy Packer would serve as a color commentator, a run that started in 1974 (he would be replaced by Clark Kellogg for 2009).\n2010s.\nDespite CBS's contract to carry the tournament until 2013, the NCAA had the option of ending its agreement with the network after the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This led to speculation that ESPN would snag the rights to future tournament games. However, on April 22, 2010, the NCAA signed a \"NCAA March Madness\" deal with CBS and the Turner Broadcasting System worth more than $10.8 billion, allowing CBS to continue airing the entire final four through the national championship, with CBS and Turner splitting coverage of earlier rounds in the now 68-team field. Since 2015, the Final Four and national championship alternate between CBS and TBS with the regional semifinals and finals being split between the two networks.\nCBS receives the same number of \"windows\", or time slots, for its tournament coverage as in previous years. However, all games are now nationally – rather than regionally – televised. Both games from a particular section and site are shown back-to-back on the same network each day, except for the second session on March 20, 2011, which was split between CBS and TruTV so that CBS could show \"60 Minutes\" at its regular time, or as close to it as possible. CBS also keeps coverage of the NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament, which is part of the larger contract for this tournament.\nIn the 2013–14 season, analysts Greg Anthony and Clark Kellogg switched roles, with Anthony moving to the broadcast booth and Kellogg returning to his previous role as a studio analyst. However, on January 17, 2015, halfway through the 2014–15 season, CBS announced Anthony would be suspended indefinitely following his arrest in Washington, D.C. the previous day on charges of soliciting prostitutes.\nUnder a sub-licensing agreement with its new rightsholder Fox (following their breakaway from the football-playing members, now known as the American Athletic Conference), CBS acquired rights to selected Big East Conference games beginning 2013–14, mainly airing on CBS Sports Network (but with selected games airing on broadcast television). As of the 2019–20 season, CBS will air 20 games per-season, with at least two on broadcast television.\nCBS also sublicensed rights to selected Atlantic Coast Conference (until 2018–19), Big 12 Conference and Pac-12 Conference games beginning 2012–13 from ESPN.\nIn 2017, CBS extended its contract with the Big Ten Conference as part of a new, six-year contract, with the network carrying 10 regular-season games per-season, and coverage of the semi-finals and championship games of the Big Ten men's basketball tournament.\n2020s.\nIn August 2022, CBS renewed its rights to the Big Ten under a seven-year deal beginning in the 2023–24 season; the network will air an increased number of regular-season games, and continue carrying coverage of the semi-finals and championship games of the Big Ten men's basketball tournament, while also adding the championship game of the Big Ten women's basketball tournament. The 2022–23 season would mark the last for Jim Nantz, who would step down after 38 years between the studio and play-by-play to spend time with family (he will continue with his NFL and golf assignments). Ian Eagle, the announcer immediately behind Nantz on the NFL, will take over as basketball lead.\nIn August 2023, CBS announced a new three-year deal with the Summit League. CBS Sports Network will at least six regular season men's basketball games, as well as the semifinals of the women's tournament and the finals of both the men's and women's tournaments. The network also has the ability to add 6 additional men's and women's regular season games.\nCoverage overview (2010–present).\nMarch Madness feed overview.\nFormer.\nUntil 2010, CBS broadcast the remaining 63 games of the NCAA tournament proper. Most areas saw only eight of 32 first-round games, seven second-round games, and four regional semifinal games (out of the possible 56 games during these rounds). Coverage preempted regular programming on the network, except during a two-hour window from about 5:00 until 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time when local affiliates were allowed to carry local newscasts and/or syndicated programming. The structure used by CBS resulted in far fewer hours of first-round coverage than under the former ESPN scheduling structure but allows the games to reach a much larger audience than ESPN is able to reach.\nCBS provided three sets of feeds from each venue, a \"constant\" feed, a \"swing\" feed and a \"flex\" feed. Constant feeds remained primarily on a given game and were used primarily by stations with local interest in a game. Despite its name, a constant feed would occasionally veer away to other games for brief updates, however, coverage generally remained with the initial game. Swing feeds tended to stay on games of natural interest, such as teams from local conferences, but would go to other games that have close scores. On a flex feed, coverage flipped from one venue to another, depending on the action at the various games in progress. If one game was a blowout, coverage would switch to a more competitive game. Flex games had no natural interest for the stations carrying them, allowing the flex game to be the best game in progress. Station feeds were planned in advance and individual owned-and-operated station and network affiliate stations had the option of requesting either constant or flex feed for various games. All games on DirecTV's Mega March Madness were sourced from the constant feed. In contrast, the regional finals, the national semifinals and the national championship were broadcast throughout the country.\nFrom 2011 to 2013, CBS aired all of its game broadcasts on a national basis. The network aired a total of 26 games in each of the three years (which did not include the games to which Turner Sports held broadcast rights): eight second-round games (four games per day), seven third-round games (four games during the first day and three games on the second due to the network's broadcast of \"60 Minutes\"), four games in the Sweet 16 (two games per day), all four of the Elite Eight games (two games per day), both of the Final Four games and the Championship Game.\nIn 2014 and 2015, CBS aired all of its game telecasts nationally. The network aired a total of 22 games in each of the two years (not including the games broadcast through Turner Sports' end of the agreement): eight second-round games (four games per day), seven third-round games (four games on the first day and three games on the second to accommodate its airing of \"60 Minutes\"), four games in the Sweet 16 (two games per day), two of the Elite Eight games (both of which were played on a Sunday) and the Championship Game.\nCurrent.\nIn 2016, CBS once again aired all of its game broadcasts nationally. The network aired a total of 21 games (not including the games broadcast through Turner Sports' end of the agreement): eight first-round games (four games per day), seven second-round games (four games on the first day and three games on the second to accommodate its airing of \"60 Minutes\") four games in the Sweet Sixteen (two games per day) and two of the Elite Eight games (both of which were played on a Saturday). For the 2021 NCAA Men's College Basketball Tournament CBS broadcast 24 games throughout the tournament. This included the National Championship, Final Four Semifinals, Elite 8, Sweet 16 and First and Second Rounds of the tournament.\nResults.\nEach year, CBS broadcasts a number of regular-season match-ups from every major conference, in addition to carrying the Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament.\nTheme music.\nThe current theme for CBS' coverage, simply titled \"CBS NCAA Basketball Theme,\" was written by Bob Christianson and has been in use by the network since the 1992–1993 season. While different arrangements have been used over that time, the melody has remained largely the same. The theme has also been used for tournament coverage on TBS, TNT and TruTV as part of its broadcast partnership with CBS. Although this new theme is different from the CBS version, it was originally only used for the NCAA Tournament broadcasts and for CBS coverage of conference tournaments. CBS continued to use the version in use since 2004 as its main theme for its regular-season coverage until the 2021–22 season, when it began using the tournament version of its theme music full-time.\nAt the end of CBS' coverage, a highlight reel featuring memorable moments from the tournament is shown, set to the song \"One Shining Moment\" originally written and performed by David Barrett (1987–1993 and 2000–2002), and subsequently covered by Teddy Pendergrass (1994–1999), Luther Vandross (2003–2009 and since 2011) and Jennifer Hudson (2010).\nBefore \"One Shining Moment\".\nThe following is a list of songs that CBS used during their closing montages from 1982 to 1986:"

        "title": "2010 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 2010 Tour de France was the 97th edition of the Tour de France cycle race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started on with an 8.9 km prologue time trial in Rotterdam, the first start in the Netherlands since 1996. The race visited three countries: the Netherlands, Belgium and France, and finished on on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.\nThe total length was including in time-trials. Following an opening prologue time trial, the first three stages passed through the Netherlands and Belgium on routes designed to replicate some features of the spring classic cycle races. This included seven cobblestone sectors totaling , the longest distance of cobblestones in the Tour since 1983, on stage 3. There were six mountain stages, three of them with mountaintop finishes, and two medium mountain stages. In the 100th anniversary year of their first inclusion on the Tour, the emphasis was on the Pyrenees, with two ascents of the Col du Tourmalet.\nThe Tour was initially won by Alberto Contador, who was later revealed to have failed a doping test. After a series of events, the CAS finally decided in February 2012 that Contador would lose his results from 2010, declaring Andy Schleck the new winner. Schleck also won the young riders' competition for the third time running. France's Anthony Charteau won the polkadot jersey as the King of the Mountains whilst the Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi won the green jersey for victory in the points classification.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams with a total of nine riders accepted invitations to participate in the 2010 Tour de France. Sixteen of the teams were covered by a September 2008 agreement with the Union Cycliste Internationale, including two no longer part of the UCI ProTour. Six other teams, including the four ProTour teams not guaranteed a place, accepted their invitations.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\nPre-race favourites.\nBefore the start of the race, Contador was the overall race favourite. Among the other favourites were Andy Schleck, Cadel Evans, and Lance Armstrong. The US media, led by the US Tour broadcaster Versus, pitched the race as a showdown between Contador and Armstrong, both multi-tour champions going in. It has been since pointed out, however, that Armstrong's chances were perhaps exaggerated prior to the race; the two had already met that year in a two-day race in March at the Critérium International and Contador had finished four minutes ahead of Armstrong.\nRoute and stages.\nThe official Tour presentation was held on 14 October 2009. It was the third consecutive Grand Tour to begin in the Netherlands, as the 2009 Vuelta a España began in Assen, and the 2010 Giro d'Italia in Amsterdam. The race consisted of nine flat stages, six mountain stages (three summit finishes), four medium mountain stages, and two individual time trials, one of them being the opening prologue in Rotterdam. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 17.\nRace overview.\nThe race started in Rotterdam with a 9 km prologue won by Fabian Cancellara. Sylvain Chavanel claimed the lead from Cancellara on Stage 2, after a massive crash which involved many riders, most notably Andy Schleck, a contender for overall victory, and Alessandro Petacchi. The riders in the peloton chose to wait for the fallen riders. However, on the cobbles of Stage 3, Cancellara retook the overall lead as Chavanel struggled. Fränk Schleck had to retire from the race, having sustained a collarbone fracture on a crash which delayed many of the riders in the peloton, including Contador and Armstrong who were hopeful of finishing high in the general classification. A number of their rivals, including Andy Schleck, Cadel Evans and Ryder Hesjedal, were ahead of the crash and so were able to gain a time advantage. Green jersey contender Thor Hushovd won the stage and took the lead in the Points classification as Geraint Thomas, who was riding in his second Tour, finished 2nd and took the white jersey from Tony Martin, who had been wearing it since the Prologue.\nOn Stage 7 Chavanel again raced away from the field to take his second stage win and maillot jaune of the 2010 edition of the race, whilst Andy Schleck took the young riders' classification lead from Thomas. Evans took the yellow jersey from Chavanel the following day on Stage 8, and in turn lost the lead to Schleck on Stage 9 following a rest day.\nIn Stage 11, Petacchi took the green jersey from Hushovd; Mark Cavendish won the stage, but his leadout rider, Mark Renshaw, was disqualified from the Tour after headbutting Julian Dean while leading out his teammate.\nOn Stage 15 Schleck was race leader and pressing the pace over the day's final climb of Port de Bales when he threw his chain. Contador and Denis Menchov immediately moved to the front and attacked, pressing the advantage over the crest of the climb and all the way back down into Bagneres-de-Luchon. They were aided by Sammy Sanchez and two others making a group of five riders, all looking to gain time. Schleck chased hard, but had no other riders to help bridge the gap. By stage's end, he had lost the yellow jersey and 39 seconds to Contador. Contador, who now had an eight-second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium at the end of the stage.\nContador said that he did not know that Schleck had technical trouble, and that he had already launched an attack by then, but review of the race shows that he was chasing an attack by Schleck, that he nearly struck Schleck as he moved past him, and that he looked back repeatedly on the climb while Schleck struggled to close down the gap. Hours later, he apologised for the incident. Although he was criticised by Sean Kelly and a number of riders both past and current, he also found support from the likes of Bernard Hinault, Miguel Induráin, Eddy Merckx and Laurent Jalabert. Cervélo team owner Gerard Vroomen commented: \"Contador just gained a great chance to win, but he lost the chance to win greatly.\" This same stage saw Anthony Charteau take the lead in the King of the Mountains competition from fellow Frenchman Jérôme Pineau.\nThe 17th stage was considered this Tour's queen stage. The first-category Col de Marie-Blanque and Col du Soulor climbs preceded a grueling summit finish atop of the Hors Catégorie Col de Tourmalet, the second ascent of the Tourmalet of this year's Tour. The stage turned into a battle between Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador. The tour's top two riders separated themselves from the field on the final climb. Schleck launched numerous attacks upon Contador in the final 15 kilometres, but was unable to separate from him. Contador coolly stayed on Schleck's wheel, and attacked as well once, but was pulled back by Schleck. Schleck went on to take the stage over Contador, who seemed happy to follow Schleck across the line while holding a seemingly unassailable lead in the GC. Meanwhile, Anthony Charteau confirmed his hold on the Polka-dot Jersey, as the Tour completed its final categorised climbs.\nOn stage 18 Petacchi took the green jersey from Hushovd for the final time. The points classification was hotly contested between these two riders and the jersey changed hands a half dozen times between them throughout the race.\nStage 19 was the final time trial. It was widely expected that Contador would increase his lead over Schleck, who in the past had struggled in this discipline, but the initial going surprised all as Schleck set a high pace that Contador had difficulty matching. By the first time check Schleck had picked up six seconds, cutting Contador's overall lead to just two seconds on the road. By the second time check Contador had recovered his losses and extended his lead over Schleck by six seconds. Over the final third of the course Contador extended his advantage, gaining an additional twenty-five seconds on his rival for an overall gain of thirty-one seconds for the stage. Fabian Cancellara, the Olympic and World Time Trial Champion, won the stage by seventeen seconds over runner-up Tony Martin. In addition Denis Menchov was able to overtake Samuel Sánchez for third place overall, while Ryder Hesjedal was able to move in front of Joaquim Rodríguez for the seventh place slot in the GC. Contador's first-place lead increased to 39 seconds, essentially guaranteeing him the victory.\nThe final stage was won by Cavendish, who became the first winner of consecutive Champs-Élysées stages. The Manx sprinter won five stages, more than any other rider in 2010 Tour, taking his career tally to 15 stage wins. Original tour winner Alberto Contador finished surrounded by his Astana teammates. This was his third Tour de France in three consecutive entries, after having won it in 2007 and 2009. Schleck finished in second place for the second year in a row (later to receive the victory after Contador's positive test and subsequent ban) and Menchov completed the podium in third place. Petacchi won the Green jersey. His second-place finish in the final stage gave him enough points to finish just above Cavendish and Hushovd. France's Charteau won the Polka dot jersey.\nDoping.\nIn September 2010, Contador revealed that a urine sample he had given on 21 July, a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France, had contained traces of clenbuterol. He has stated, due to the number of other tests he passed and that only a tiny amount of the substance was detected in the one he failed, that food contamination was to blame. The UCI issued a statement reporting that the concentration was 50 picograms per millilitre, and that this was 1/40 the minimum standards of detection capability required by WADA, and that further scientific investigation would be required. In late January 2011, the Spanish Cycling Federation proposed a one-year ban, but it subsequently accepted Contador's appeal and cleared him of all charges. The UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency each referred the decision independently to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in March 2011, but Contador remained free to ride until their ruling was made. The hearing was delayed until after the 2011 Tour de France at Contador's request and then deferred to November 2011. On 6 February 2012, the CAS stripped Contador of the 2010 title, making Andy Schleck the winner.\nArmstrong was stripped of all his professional results from August 1998 to August 2012, including his seven Tour titles on 22 October 2012. Armstrong's finish in the 2010 Tour—originally 23rd; 22nd at the time of its stripping—was also stripped. In January 2013, Armstrong admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Although he admitted to have doped in his seven wins, he denied doping in the 2009 and 2010 Tours. Regardless, Armstrong was stripped of his finishes in those two Tours as well, because his blood values indicated that he doped. USADA's report stated that \"The likelihood of Armstrong's blood values from the 2009 and 2010 Tours de France occurring naturally is less than one in a million\".\nOn 10 July 2014, a UCI press release detailing various athlete sanctions specified that Menchov had been banned (for a period of two years) until 9 April 2015 due to adverse biological passport findings. Due to this, he has been disqualified from the 2009, 2010 and 2012 Tours de France.\nIn May 2011, newspaper \"l'Equipe\" published a list of cyclists and an index that indicated the suspicion for doping use.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2010 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1985. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Sylvain Chavanel was given the overall super-combativity award.\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder and first race director Henri Desgrange, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given in honour of the second director Jacques Goddet, both to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stages 17 and 16 respectively.

He served as head coach for the Saskatchewan Roughriders (1973–1976), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (1978–1980) and Ottawa Rough Riders (1996) of the Canadian Football League (CFL), compiling a career record of 62–63–3. Payne also was the head football coach at Abilene Christian University from 1985 to 1990, posting a mark of 26–34–2.\nCoaching career.\nAfter serving as an assistant with Central High School and BYU, Payne moved to the Canadian Football League in 1968. He served as an assistant with the Edmonton Eskimos, Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Saskatchewan Roughriders before becoming the Roughriders head coach in 1973. In his four season as head coach, Payne had a 40–23–1 record and led Saskatchewan to the 1976 Grey Cup.\nPayne left the Roughriders in 1977 and joined Tommy Hudspeth's coaching staff with the Detroit Lions. The entire staff was fired on January 9, 1978. He returned to the CFL, replacing Tom Dimitroff as head coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats five games into the 1978 season. He had some success with Hamilton, compiling an 18–24–1 record over three seasons and leading the team to the 1980 Grey Cup. After the Tiger-Cats trouncing at the hands of the Edmonton Eskimo dynasty 48–10 in the Grey Cup game, owner Harold Ballard indicated that he preferred recently fired Arizona State football coach Frank Kush over Payne, which led to his resignation.\nAfter leaving the Hamilton TigerCats, Payne went to Texas Christian University, where he coached as the offensive line coach under head coach F.A. Dry from 1981 to 1983. He then moved to Chicago to coach with the USFL team, the Chicago Blitz under George Allen. Payne moved to Arizona when the Blitz franchise was moved and became the Arizona Wranglers. \nIn 1985, Payne became head coach at Abilene Christian University located in Abilene, Texas. He was the Wildcats head coach for six seasons and had a coaching record of 26–34–2.\nPayne returned to the CFL in 1993 as the offensive line coach for the Sacramento Gold Miners. In 1995, Norton Herrick, an Orlando, Florida real estate developer, announced plans to move the CFL's Las Vegas Posse to Jackson, Mississippi. Payne was to be the club's head coach, however plans fell through and the relocation did not take place; the team instead folded. In 1996, Payne, then an assistant with the Ottawa Rough Riders, was promoted to head coach. He coached the team to a 3–11 record; the team finished the year 3–15. The Rough Riders ceased operations after the season and Payne became the final coach in the 120-year history of the team.\nOn November 18, 1997, the New York CityHawks of the Arena Football League named Payne offensive coordinator."

        "title": "Rugby League Four Nations",
        "text": "The Rugby League Four Nations was a rugby league football tournament run in partnership between Australia, England, New Zealand, and a guest nation which changed with every edition.\nThe tournament replaced the previous Tri-Nations format by including a fourth nation that qualifies by winning their respective regional competition in a rotation between Europe and the South Pacific.\nHistory.\nPre–2008: Origins.\nThe Four Nations replaced the Tri-Nations tournament that was contested between Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. The competition ceased in 2006 with the RLIF wanting more nations to play in regular tournaments with the 'Big Three'. England replaced Great Britain as the third nation and the fourth nation has to qualify, depending on where the tournament is being played the fourth nation is either from the Northern or Southern Hemisphere.\n2009–2013: Tournament.\nThe inaugural Four Nations was played in England and France in 2009 with France qualifying to be the fourth nation via winning the 2005 European Championship. The big three dominated the tournament with Australia beating England in the final. The next tournament was played the following year in 2010 with Australia and New Zealand hosting the tournament. PNG qualified as the fourth nation through the 2009 Pacific Cup. The big three again dominated and Australia beat New Zealand in the final for their third title. 2011 was the third consecutive tournament being held in England and Wales, Wales qualified by winning the 2010 European Championship. The final was a repeat of 2009 with Australia beating England. The tournament was not played in 2012 to give teams a rest before the 2013 World Cup.\nThe next Four Nations was played in 2014 after the World Cup. The competition was played in the Southern Hemisphere for the first time since 2010 with Samoa qualifying as the fourth nation. Samoa impressed, although they did not win a game they had close games against the big three. New Zealand beat Australia in the final.\nThe next tournament took place in England in 2016. Scotland qualified for the tournament and also became the first qualifying nation to avoid losing every game when they drew with New Zealand 18-18. The final for the 2016 tournament took place at Anfield Stadium in Liverpool, as compared to Elland Road, Leeds, in 2009 and 2011. Australia won for the third time in five tournaments, defeating New Zealand in the final.\n, the tournament has not been played since 2016.\nFormat.\nQualification.\nThe fourth nation alternated between Europe and the Pacific and saw a different team take part in each competition.\nIn 2009 a qualifying tournament was held, the Pacific Cup, involving Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and the Cook Islands. The winners, Papua New Guinea, qualified for the 2010 Four Nations. Likewise in 2010, the European Nations Cup decided the fourth participant in the 2011 tournament, Wales. In 2014, a single game was staged to decide the fourth team for that year, with Samoa beating Fiji 32–16. That same year, it was announced that the winner of the 2014 European Cup would qualify for the 2016 Four Nations, the winning team being Scotland who qualified on points difference by three points over France.\nCompetition.\nThe tournament was organised in round-robin format. Each team played the others once, before the top two teams played each other in a tournament final. The top two teams were calculated using a league table. Teams received:\nResults.\nTo date no fourth nation has appeared in the final of the Four Nations and no team from outside of Oceania has won the tournament despite England appearing in two finals, losing both to Australia. Furthermore, no fourth nation has even won a single game however Scotland managed to draw 18–18 against New Zealand in 2016. Samoa came close to a win in 2014 losing their first two games by just one try.\nThe largest winning margin in a game was in 2010 when New Zealand beat Papua New Guinea by 76–12, a margin of 64 points. There has only been two draws in the history of the tournament when Australia and New Zealand fought out a 20–20 draw in the 2009 tournament and again a draw when New Zealand played Scotland in the 2016 tournament with an 18–18 draw.\nAttendances.\nAverage Attendances.\nThe average attendances of the Four Nations tournaments fluctuate between the northern and southern hemisphere competitions with the southern hemisphere always having higher averages than the previous tournaments in the northern hemisphere. The largest change between two tournaments was between 2009 and 2010 which saw an 18.45% increase or an average of 3,060. The largest total stadium capacity was 214,500 in 2010 despite this tournament having the lowest stadium occupancy with 64.10%.\nHighest Attendances.\nTo date, there has been 4 attendances over 40,000 and 8 attendances over 30,000. Three of these attendances were double-headers which took place at Eden Park, Auckland in 2010, Wembley Stadium, London in 2011 and Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane in 2014; the latter two double-headers are also the largest attendances in the respective hemispheres. Four of these games were tournament finals in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2016. Only one final did not have an attendance over 30,000, this being the 2014 edition. \nVenues.\nAs of 2016 Four Nations ().\nPlayer statistics.\nOverall try-scorers.\nOver the history of the competition 125 players have scored tries. The top try-scorers are Jason Nightingale of New Zealand and Ryan Hall of England with 11 tries each. The highest try-scorer from a 'fourth nation' is Daniel Vidot from Samoa who scored 3 tries in the 2014 competition. Australia has had the most try-scorers with 39 different players scoring. Both Samoa and Scotland have had 8 try-scorers each, making them the 'fourth nations' with the most players scoring.\nTop pointscorers.\nThe five highest overall points-scorers are goal-kickers with Johnathan Thurston being top, having scored 126 points; 106 of these points have come from 53 goals. The highest points-scorers who are not goal kickers are Jason Nightingale and Ryan Hall who have both scored 44 points from 11 tries and are the joint sixth highest points scorers."

        "title": "Field goal (rugby)",
        "text": "A field goal, also called a flying kick or speculator, was a way of scoring in the game of rugby football. It consisted of a player kicking the ball from the ground (not on a kicking tee) without using their hands in open play over the crossbar. This method of scoring was abolished in rugby union in 1905 and in rugby league in 1950.\nRugby union.\nDuring the development of rugby football, the field goal was considered a legitimate way of scoring. In 1845, place kicks were the only way to score a goal. In 1871, it was clarified under Law 6 that kicking the ball through the posts from the ground in open play was a valid method of scoring a goal. A rejected proposal in 1882 by the Rugby Football Union suggested that field goals, referred to as a \"flying kick\", would be worth 4 points, the same value as a try. It was eventually formalised in 1891 by the International Rugby Football Board that field goals (classed as any other goals) would be worth 4 points. However, in 1905 both the IRFB and Rugby Football Union (RFU) abolished the field goal as a valid method of scoring.\nRugby league.\nWhen the Northern Rugby Football Union broke away from the RFU, both codes' governing bodies retained the field goal. While the RFU abolished the field goal in rugby union in 1905, rugby league retained it. However, there was criticism about it on the 190809 Australia rugby league tour of Britain, whereby the Australia national rugby league team player Dally Messenger continuously and recklessly attempted field goals during a match against the England national rugby league team. A writer for the \"Daily Chronicle\" stated: \"I do not believe in the speculator at any time, it is bad rugby football\", and expressed concern that Dally would either injure himself or others. As predicted, during a later match against St. Helens, he damaged the cartilage in his knee due to repeated attempts at the scoring move.\nIn 1922, the New South Wales Rugby Football League abolished this type of field goal along with the goal from mark. However the Northern Rugby Football League, considered the guardian of the rules of rugby league at the time, kept the method in the rulebook, not officially abolishing it until 1950. In Australia, the term field goal is used as a synonym for drop goal."

        "title": "2009 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2009 Rose Bowl, the 95th edition of the annual game, was a college football bowl game played on Thursday, January 1, 2009 at the same-named stadium in Pasadena, California. Because of sponsorship by Citi, the first game in the 2009 edition of the Bowl Championship Series was officially titled the Rose Bowl Game presented by Citi. The contest was televised on ABC with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio beginning at 4:30 PM US EST with kickoff at 5:10 PM. Ticket prices for all seats in the Rose Bowl were listed at $145. The Rose Bowl Game was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public.\nScoring 24 unanswered points in the second quarter, the Pacific-10 Conference Champion University of Southern California Trojans defeated the Big Ten Conference co-champion, the Pennsylvania State University Nittany Lions, 38-24, for their third consecutive Rose Bowl victory (in their fourth consecutive appearance, having lost the 2006 BCS title game to the Texas Longhorns). The victory gave the Trojans their 24th Rose Bowl championship, the most by any team in the country. Quarterback Mark Sanchez scored five touchdowns, one rushing and four passing.\nPrior to the game, the Pac-10 conference had a 4-0 record in bowl games this season with wins by Arizona, Cal, Oregon, and Oregon State. The Trojan win gave the Pac-10 a perfect five out of five games, which was the only perfect conference bowl record of the season. The Big Ten conference had last won a Rose Bowl game in the 1999 season; this streak ended when Ohio State beat Oregon in the 2010 Rose Bowl.\nTeams.\nThe teams participating in the Rose Bowl Game were announced on Sunday, December 7, by the Pasadena Tournament of Roses football committee. Big Ten co-champions, Penn State, coached by Joe Paterno, were picked to play against Southern California, the champions of the Pac-10, coached by Pete Carroll. Penn State earned its bid via a head-to-head tiebreaker, beating Ohio State, 13–6 in Columbus, Ohio, on October 25, 2008. The Men of Troy earned their way in by defeating UCLA 28-7 on December 6, 2008. USC was designated as the home team, wearing dark jerseys and using the east bench on game day.\nThe 2009 game marked the first time since 2004 Rose Bowl that the traditional teams—the champions of the Big Ten and the Pac-10—squared off at the Rose Bowl, because at least one league champion played in the BCS Championship in each the previous four years. In the 2005 Rose Bowl, Big Ten champion Michigan met Texas, as USC played Oklahoma in the designated BCS Championship Game that year, the Orange Bowl. The following year, USC met Texas in the game, which was designated as that year's BCS National Championship contest; Big Ten champion Penn State played in the Orange Bowl against Florida State. For the 2007 and 2008 games, the runners-up of the Big Ten were sent to this game, since the champion, Ohio State, participated in the newly established separate BCS Championship Game: the Wolverines played in 2007 and Illinois would do so the following year; both teams played (and lost to) the Trojans.\nEach team lost just one game during the 2008 regular season. Penn State was defeated by Iowa (24-23) and Southern California lost to Oregon State (27-21). USC and Penn State had faced two common opponents in the regular season. Both teams defeated Ohio State and Penn State beat Oregon State prior to the Beavers' defeat of the Trojans.\nPenn State had appeared in the Rose Bowl twice before, losing to the Trojans 14-3 in in their only previous meeting in \"The Granddaddy Of Them All\", and winning in over 1994 Pac-10 champion Oregon 38-20, the latter game capped an unbeaten season in which Penn State finished #2 in both major polls. The Trojans have played in the Rose Bowl more times than any other team and made its fourth consecutive appearance in 2009. The two teams have faced each other eight times, with each team winning four games. The Kickoff Classic XVIII on August 27, 2000, in Giants Stadium at East Rutherford, New Jersey, was the last time they met: the Trojans defeated the Nittany Lions, 29-5."
