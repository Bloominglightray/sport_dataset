        "text": "Japan Rugby League One (formerly the Top League) is a rugby union competition in Japan. It is the highest level of professional rugby competition in the country. The Japan Rugby Football Union created the competition in 2003, by absorbing the Japan Company Rugby Football Championship, to drive up the overall standard and popularity of the sport and improve the results of the Japan national rugby union team. The chief architect of the league was Hiroaki Shukuzawa who strongly felt the urgency of improving Japanese domestic company rugby to a professional level which would allow Japan to compete more convincingly at Rugby World Cups.\nUntil 2022, it was an industrial league, where many players were employees of their company and the teams were all owned by major companies. While the competition was known for paying high salaries, only world-class foreign players and a small number of Japanese players played fully professionally, which meant most of the players still played in an amateur capacity. The delayed 2021 season was the final season of the Top League, with the JRFU adopting a new fully-professional three-tier system from 2022. More details about the new structure was announced to the media in January 2021. Featuring 25 teams, the 12 top-tier clubs would be split into two conferences, with seven teams competing in division two and six in division three. The new competition was formally announced as Japan Rugby League One in July 2021.\nThe first season in 2003–04 featured 12 teams. The league was expanded to 14 teams in 2006–07 and 16 teams in 2013–14. The Top League is played during the off-season of the Super Rugby, Therefore, many full-time foreign professionals from Southern Hemisphere countries have played in the Top League, notably Tony Brown, George Gregan and Dan Carter. In the 2010s, salaries in the Top League have risen to become some of the highest in the rugby world; in 2012, South Africa's Jaque Fourie, now with Kobelco Steelers, was widely reported to be the world's highest-paid player.\nRugby System's Divisions.\nThe 2023-24 format for the Japanese club system is divided into three divisions.\nDivision 1.\nThe league consists of 12 teams based in various cities in the country.\nRelated competitions.\nA second-tier Top League Challenge Series was also introduced in 2003. Between 2003–04 and 2016–17, teams from three regional leagues would qualify to this post-season competition, in which they could either win promotion to the next season's Top League, or qualify to promotion play-off matches.\nIn 2017, a second-tier Top Challenge League was introduced, to operate in a league format above the regional leagues.\nThe regional leagues are:\nWith the creation of Rugby League One and its three divisions, the \"raison d'etre\" for the Top Challenge League ceased to exist, and it was discontinued.\nSeasons.\nFourteen teams: 2006 to 2012.\nNinth season (2011–12).\nNTT Shining Arcs and Yamaha Jubilo which won their 2005 promotion/relegation play-offs (\"Irekaesen\") against Canon Eagles and Kyuden Voltex to retain their places for the 2011–12 season. The following teams were in the league:\nThe top 4 sides of the regular season (Suntory, Toshiba, Sanyo, and NEC) competed in the 2012 Top League Champions Cup knock-out tournament for the Top League title at Chichibu, Tokyo. Suntory defeated Sanyo 47–28 in the final to win the title. Both teams met again a few weeks later in the final of the 49th All-Japan Rugby Football Championship.\nAdditionally, in the Wildcard play-offs, the Top League teams ranked 5th and 8th (Kintetsu Liners and Yamaha Jubilo) played each other at Hanazono, Osaka, as did the teams ranked 6th and 7th (Kobe Steelers and Ricoh Black Rams), with the winners (Kobe and Yamaha) also qualifying for the All-Japan Rugby Football Championship.\nEighth season (2010–11).\nHonda Heat and Kyuden Voltex were automatically relegated at the completion of the 2009–10 season for finishing 13th and 14th. Toyota Industries Shuttles and NTT Communications Shining Arcs won promotion through the Top Challenge series. The following teams were in the league:\nThe top 4 sides (Toshiba, Sanyo, Toyota and Suntory) from the regular season competed in a knock out tournament to fight for the Top League title. In the final, Sanyo defeated Suntory 28–23.\nSeventh season (2009–10).\nIBM Big Blue and Yokogawa Atlastars were automatically relegated at the completion of the 2008–9 season for finishing 13th and 14th.

Mitsubishi (14th) and Ricoh (13th) were automatically relegated.\nFourth season (2006–7).\nThe number of teams was increased from 12 to 14. Coca-Cola West Red Sparks became the second Kyushu-based team in the Top League. IBM returned to the league.\nThe top four teams in the league played in the Microsoft Cup which was officially integrated into the league from this season as the \"Top League Play-off Tournament Microsoft Cup\". Toshiba won the cup and also won the All-Japan Championship.

        "title": "Bob Welch (baseball)",
        "text": "Robert Lynn Welch (November 3, 1956 – June 9, 2014) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1978–87) and Oakland Athletics (1988–94). Prior to his professional career, he attended Eastern Michigan University, where he played college baseball for the Eastern Michigan Hurons baseball team. He helped lead the Hurons, coached by Ron Oestrike, to the 1976 College World Series, losing to Arizona in the Championship Game.\nWelch was a two-time MLB All-Star, and he won the American League Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher in 1990. He was a three-time World Series champion – twice as a player and once as a coach. He is the most recent major league pitcher to win at least 25 games in a single season (27 in 1990).\nPlaying career.\nIn a 17-year career, Welch compiled a 211–146 record with 1,969 strikeouts and a 3.47 ERA in 3,092 innings. His 137 wins during the 1980s ranked third among major league pitchers during that decade, following Jack Morris and Dave Stieb. Welch won the American League Cy Young Award in 1990 while pitching for the Oakland Athletics. He threw two complete games in 1990, both of them shutouts. Welch finished in the top 10 voting for the National League Cy Young Award twice (1983 and 1987).\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nWelch gained national fame with the Dodgers during their 1978 season, when as a 21-year-old rookie he struck out Reggie Jackson of the New York Yankees with two men on base and two out in the top of the ninth inning of Game 2 of the 1978 World Series.\nOn May 29, 1980, Welch pitched a 3–0 one-hitter against the Atlanta Braves, facing the minimum 27 batters. The only Atlanta base runner was Larvell Blanks, who singled in the fourth inning and was retired on a double play.\nWelch won the 1981 World Series, his first, as the Dodgers defeated the Yankees in six games.\nIn 1983, Welch became the sixth pitcher to throw a complete-game shutout and hit a solo home run for his team's only run. This was not accomplished again until Noah Syndergaard did so in 2019.\nOakland Athletics.\n Welch was the third starting pitcher in the rotation for the 1989 World Series champion Oakland A's, compiling a regular-season record of 17-8 and recording a win in his only start in the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. In an odd twist of fate, however, Welch did not throw a single pitch against the San Francisco Giants during the World Series itself. Just minutes before Welch was to take the mound in Game 3, Candlestick Park and the Bay Area were struck by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which caused extensive damage in the region and forced the postponement of the game. When the Series was resumed 11 days later, A's manager Tony La Russa opted to re-use his Game 1 starter, Dave Stewart, for Game 3 in place of Welch, and his Game 2 starter, Mike Moore, for Game 4 in place of originally scheduled starter Storm Davis. The strategy worked, as the A's swept the Series in four games, giving Welch his second World Series title.\nA two-time All-Star (1980 and 1990), Welch won 14 or more games in eight years, with a career-high 27 in 1990. He received the Cy Young Award that season, and was considered in the MVP vote. His 27 wins were the most by any pitcher since Steve Carlton also won 27 in , and as of 2023 stands as the last time a pitcher has won 25 or more games in a season (the closest anyone has come to that mark since is 24, accomplished by John Smoltz in 1996, Randy Johnson in 2002, and Justin Verlander in 2011). The last pitcher to win more games in a season was Denny McLain, with 31 wins in . Nineteen of his wins were saved by Dennis Eckersley, which remains a record.\nWelch was the starting pitcher of Game 2 of the 1990 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Welch's personal catcher throughout much of his Oakland Athletics career was Ron Hassey, as opposed to Terry Steinbach, who caught the majority of the Oakland pitching staff.\nAutobiography and alcoholism.\nIn 1991, Welch and \"The New York Times\" sports columnist George Vecsey co-wrote \"Five O'Clock Comes Early: A Cy Young Award-Winner Recounts His Greatest Victory\", which chronicled Welch's battle with alcoholism that he said started at the age of sixteen: \"I would get a buzz on and I would stop being afraid of girls. I was shy, but with a couple of beers in me, it was all right.\"\nThe book \"...marked one of the first times an active professional athlete openly discussed a drinking addiction.\" An updated version was published after Welch's retirement, and the book was re-released digitally the year after Welch's death, on November 10, 2015.\nRetirement.\nWelch was the pitching coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks when they won the World Series in 2001. During the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Welch served as the pitching coach for The Netherlands. Welch was a pitching coach in the Oakland Athletics organization at the time of his death.\nHis son Riley Welch was a 34th round selection by the Oakland A's in the 2008 MLB draft out of Desert Mountain high school in Scottsdale, Arizona but did not sign and went on to play college baseball at the University of Hawaii. Riley then signed as an undrafted free agent with the Dodgers. He became a pitching coach at Presentation College, an NAIA school in Aberdeen, South Dakota in 2014.\nDeath.\nWelch died of a broken neck resulting from an accidental fall in the bathroom of his Seal Beach, California, home on June 9, 2014, at the age of 57. The Orange County Coroner's Office ruled that Welch suffered a cervical spine fracture \"with epidural hemorrhage due to hyperextension of neck\" suffered in the fall, negating earlier reports that he had died from a heart attack."

Between 1950 and 1966 the championship was open to both amateurs and professionals. From 1967 to 1993 two separate championships were organised – one for amateurs and one for professionals. From 1994 the championship became a single event again open to all elite riders. A junior world championship was introduced in 1976. All are organized by the \"Union Cycliste Internationale\" (UCI), and the winner has the right to wear the rainbow jersey for a full year, like the winners of the world championships in other cycling disciplines.\nUnlike many UCI-sanctioned races, all the World Championships are organized by nationality, not by commercial teams. The race is usually held towards the end of the season; normally January. This list does \"not\" include the Men's Amateur World Championship medal winners."

        "title": "History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883",
        "text": " \nTest matches in the period 1877 to 1883 were organised somewhat differently from international cricket matches today. All were between Australian and English sides, the teams were rarely representative, and the lengthy boat trip required was one that many cricketers (especially amateurs) were unable or unwilling to undertake. As such, the home teams enjoyed a great advantage.\nThirteen Test matches were played during the period between Australian and English sides. Most were not styled as representative \"England v. Australia\" contests, however: this description was only applied later by cricket statisticians. The same is true of their designation as \"Test matches\", which did not enter into the vernacular until 1885. Eleven of the thirteen matches played to 1883 were in Australia, where the colonials made the most of their home advantage, winning seven while England won four, and two matches were drawn.\nBy 1883, the tradition of England-Australia tours was well established, that year having concluded the first Ashes series. When England lost at home for the first time in 1882, \"The Sporting Times\" lamented the death of cricket in the mother country and declared that \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\". England captain Ivo Bligh promised that on the tour to Australia in 1882–83 he would regain \"the ashes\" and the term began to be established. During that tour a small terracotta urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women. The urn is commonly, but erroneously, believed to be the trophy of the Ashes series, but it has never been formally adopted as such and Bligh always considered it to be a personal gift.\nA number of the problems that continue to bedevil cricket today had already surfaced by 1883: there were umpiring disputes, betting controversies, match-fixing, and even a riot.\nGenesis of Test cricket.\nThere was a long build-up to what became the first Test tour. The inaugural overseas visit of leading English cricketers was organised by John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, a strong player himself. Having recently been an ambassador to France, where he promoted the game of cricket, Dorset arranged a tour to that country in 1789. Although it is unclear against whom they were to play, his men did get as far as an assembly in Dover, ready for the cross-Channel trip to France. The Duke's timing was poor, however, for the French Revolution had just broken out. His cricket tour became the first one to be abandoned for political reasons.\nIt was not until the 19th century that strong \"England\" teams began to form. By the late 18th, there were many games played by sides designated \"England\" – \"England\" vs \"Hambledon\" and \"England\" vs \"Kent\", for instance – but these were not truly representative. By 1846, however, William Clarke, a bricklayer from Nottingham, had formed the All-England Eleven, a mostly professional team of top cricketers who toured the country, taking on local sides. Leading amateurs such as Alfred Mynn also played on occasion. Matches were usually against the odds, with eleven men in their team versus 22 for the opposition, to make it a more interesting and even contest.\nIn 1852, together with fellow Sussex man Jemmy Dean, John Wisden founded the United All-England Eleven, providing both financial and sporting competition to Clarke's side. The matches between these two became the highlight of every English season, and the teams, both essentially business ventures, went a long way to popularising the game in England.\nThe year 1859 saw the first main representative tour by an England team. It was captained by George Parr and comprised six players from the All-England Eleven, together with another six from the United All-England XI. The team toured United States and Canada, where cricket was very popular. The match in New York, for example, is said to have been watched by 10,000 people, but this may well be an exaggeration. Even more saw the team when it played in Philadelphia, the spiritual home of North American cricket. All matches were played against the odds, and the tour was a financial success, the English players making £90 each.\nThe year 1861 brought the first English side to Australia. North America was avoided this time because of the Civil War. It was a weak side, dominated by Surrey players because George Parr and his Notts men would not accept £150 per head plus expenses. The Englishmen won half their twelve matches, losing two and drawing four, all against the odds. This was followed in 1863/64 by another tour to both Australia and New Zealand, led by George Parr and including the amateur E. M. Grace, older brother of W. G.\nIn 1868 a team of Aboriginal Australians toured England – see \"Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868\" – becoming the first Australians to visit England. Also in that year, an English side, led by Edgar Willsher, toured North America and beat a XXII of the United States and a XXII of Canada. An English side toured North America for the third time, in 1872, led by R. A. Fitzgerald. Among its number was W. G. Grace, who was already recognised as the greatest cricketer in England. In 1873/4, Grace himself led a tour to Australia which included four amateurs. The most important game was played and won against a XV of New South Wales and Victoria. Up to this point, all but one match had been played against odds.\nThe first Test tour: 1876/77.\nTwo Englishmen tried to promote separate tours to Australia for the 1876/77 season: James Lillywhite pushed a tour of professional cricketers, while Fred Grace (brother of W.G. Grace) promoted one that would have included amateurs. Despite the many initial preparations for Grace's tour, it fell through, leaving Lillywhite's to go solo. It visited New Zealand first and then Australia. Its highlights were two games against a Combined Australia XI, which later came to be recognised as the first Test matches. \nLillywhite's team was considered weak. It did not include any of the leading amateurs of the day, like \"The Champion\", W. G. Grace, and was further handicapped after its only specialist wicketkeeper, Ted Pooley, was left behind in New Zealand facing a charge of assault. \"The Australasian\" wrote of Lillywhite's men that they were\nby a long way the weakest side that have ever played in the colonies, notwithstanding the presence of Shaw, who is termed the premier bowler of England. If Ulyett, Emmett, and Hill are specimens of the best fast bowling in England, all we can say is, either they have not shown their proper form, or British bowling has sadly deteriorated.\nThe first Test, against a Combined Australia XI, was billed as the \"Grand Combination Match\", and was scheduled to be held at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, because the Melbourne Cricket Ground had been booked by Grace. With Grace having pulled out, however, Lillywhite moved his matches to the larger, and more profitable, MCG, to the considerable ire of the East Melbourne functionaries. The Combined Australia XI included cricketers from New South Wales and Victoria, but there were also some notable absentees. Fred Spofforth, Australia's legendary \"Demon Bowler\", did not play in the first Test as a show of dissent at the non-selection of Billy Murdoch, the New South Wales wicket-keeper to whom he then attributed much of his success. He declared that he would play only if Murdoch kept wicket, but Jack Blackham had already been chosen. Spofforth's appeal was seen as a display of insolence shocking in a man of twenty-three. \"As this could not be arranged,\" went the sardonic remark of the time, \"this modest gentleman was left out.\" Despite the name of the Australian side, all but four of its members were British-born.\nThe first Test.\nAt 1.05 p.m. on 15 March 1877, the first Test began. It was dominated by Charles Bannerman, who scored the first single in Test history off Alfred Shaw's second ball, was dropped on ten by Tom Armitage off the same bowler (who himself would drop Bannerman twice) and had 27 by lunch at 14:00, with the Combined XI 42 for three. Bannerman increased his scoring rate after the interval and reached his century at 16:25, by which time the crowd was around 4,500. By the close of play at 5 p.m., he had moved on to 126, and Combined Australia had made 166 for six.\nOn the second day, the attendance of about 4,000 spectators was found to include \"a large number of spectators...supposed to have got in free, by means of tickets not sold at the gates, but procured illegitimately somewhere else\", and about 500 heads watching over the fence from outside the ground. Bannerman took his score to 165 on the second day before he was forced to retire hurt after a delivery from George Ulyett split the index finger of his right hand. Australia was 240 for 7 at that stage; the innings promptly collapsed to 245 all out. Bannerman had scored 67% of the runs in the innings, which remains a record today. His score is still the highest by an Australian on Test debut, and the thirteenth highest by all debutants. His performance so impressed the public that a subscription was initiated, which raised £83 7s 6d for him.\nThe England XI first innings was opened by Jupp and Selby at about 3 p.m. It was immediately apparent that the Australian fielding was \"hurried\" and \"reckless\" in contrast with that seen earlier from the \"well-drilled Englishmen\", and the batsmen amused the crowd by running quick singles after tapping the ball a few yards. By close of play at 5 p.m., England had made 109 for the loss of four wickets, Jupp having contributed 54 not out, after dislodging a bail with his foot and being given not out in the first of many controversial umpiring decisions in Ashes history.\nOn the third day, a Saturday, play started earlier at 12:15. An estimated 9,000 to 12,000 spectators saw the visitors eventually dismissed for 196, 49 short of their colonial opponents. When the Australians batted again at 3.30 p.m., Bannerman bravely opened the innings but was dismissed for four. Lillywhite's XI attacked fiercely with fast bowling, Shaw taking five for 38 and Ulyett three for 39. By the close, Australia had been reduced to 83 for nine, a lead of just 132.\nOn the fourth afternoon, Australia's last-wicket stand extended the lead to 153, and Lillywhite's XI collapsed to 108 all out in just over two hours. Australia thus won by 45 runs, and the crowd was vociferous in its congratulations. Captain Dave Gregory, was given a gold medal by the Victorian Cricket Association, while his team-mates received silver medals. Losing captain James Lillywhite was magnanimous in defeat. \"The win,\" he said, \"was [...] a feather in their cap and a distinction that no Englishman will begrudge them [...].\"\nThe second Test.\nFollowing the success of the first Test, a second was quickly arranged, with the tourists taking a larger slice of the gate receipts. Melbourne Cricket Club contributed £50 to the cost of bringing New South Welshmen, such as Spofforth and Murdoch, down to Melbourne. Lillywhite's team proved itself stronger than \"The Australasian\" had suggested, and went on to win the match.\nOn the first day, Australia won the toss but was tied down completely by the English bowlers. Billy Midwinter top-scored with 31 as Australia struggled slowly to 122 in 112.1 four-ball overs. Australia struck back immediately, however, leaving England seven for two at the close. The attendance that first Saturday was poor, with only 4,500 paying to get into the ground.\nThe second day was all England's, as a solid performance took the score to 261 all out at the close, a lead of 139. Lillywhite's XI was so dominant that there were rumours that they had deliberately underperformed in the first game so as to secure better odds from bookmakers on winning the second, or at the very least bolster gate receipts.\nEngland was still on top on the third day, despite a better Australian performance: at stumps, the hosts were 207 for seven, Lillywhite himself having picked up four wickets. Only 1,500 were watching by the time his side was set 121 to win on the Wednesday. Victory was secured by early afternoon.\nThe Test matches, particularly the first one, greatly excited the colonial press. There was little coverage in England, however, and it was only later, once they were recognised as Tests, that any real note was taken of them there.\nEngland in Australia 1876/7. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. Series result: Drawn 1–1.\nThe tours of 1878, 1878–79 and 1880.\nAfter the success of Lillywhite's tour, the Australians decided to visit England in 1878. W. G. Grace and James Lillywhite both suggested promoting the tour themselves, but leading Australian cricketers eventually put up the money of their own account, and Lillywhite helped them to arrange the matches. The Australians acquitted themselves well, losing only four of the matches that they played on equal terms. They also beat a Marylebone Cricket Club team that included Grace by nine wickets. Although the MCC is considered stronger than Lillywhite's 1876–77 men, the match has not been accorded Test status. Still, its result did much to increase the reputation of Australian cricket in England.\nThe success of the tour encouraged Lillywhite and Shaw to raise another team to visit Australia, but they both withdrew when the MCC asked Lord Harris to lead a tour. The captaincy was first offered to Monkey Hornby, but he demurred to his Lordship. The team was originally intended to be all amateur, but, in the end, professionals Emmett and Ulyett were added to the squad, mostly for bowling duties. Harris and Hornby brought their wives with them.\nThe highlight of the tour was the match billed as an \"English XI\" versus \"Dave Gregory's Australian XI\", which was later recognised as a Test. Harris's side was weak, with a long batting tail. The game was largely unremarkable, decided as it was primarily by the weather. Harris won the toss and elected to bat after thunderstorms struck on the morning before the opening afternoon's play. His side fell foul of this error and was soon all out for 113, Spofforth taking the first Test hat-trick. Australia was 95 for three by stumps.\nAustralia was well ahead by the end of the second day. Around 7,000 spectators, the same as on the opening day, saw the score taken to 256. English round-arm fast bowler Tom Emmett secured a Test career-best of seven for 68. With England 103 for six at the close, it was clear that the third day would not last long. England reached 160, and Australia knocked off the nineteen required runs in only eleven deliveries. The early finish led to an impromptu second match between an MCC XI and a New Zealand team from Canterbury.\nFive weeks after the match, one of cricket's early riots took place and led to the cancellation of the return match. It was widely reported in England, as a consequence of which the 1880 Australian tour to England was guaranteed a frosty welcome. The team found it difficult to secure good opponents, with most counties turning it down, although Yorkshire took it on in two unofficial matches; indeed, so sparse did the fixture list become that the side resorted to advertising itself, offering to play any team that would accept it. The English public was more sympathetic towards the Australian captain Billy Murdoch than his predecessor Dave Gregory, however, and this led Harris to be persuaded by the secretary of Surrey County Cricket Club, C. W. Alcock, to put a team together to play them at Surrey's home ground, The Oval.\nIn view of what had happened at Sydney, this was a generous gesture by his Lordship. Hornby, Emmett and Ulyett, three of the players who saw the riot, refused to play, but Harris assembled a strong team that included the Grace brotherhood, making for the first instance of three sibling playing in the same Test. Australia was without star bowler Spofforth, who had sustained a hand injury in Yorkshire from a decidedly illicit local bowler.\nThe 1880 Test match was well attended: there were 20,814 paying spectators on the Monday, 19,863 on Tuesday and 3,751 on Wednesday. For the first two days, it was a one-sided affair. W. G. Grace hit 152 as England piled up 420, all but ten of which came on the first day.\nOn the second day, Australia scored 149 and was forced to follow-on, slumping to 170 for six at the close, still 101 behind. A chanceless and undefeated 153 by Murdoch lifted Australia to 327, forcing England to bat again. The hosts, chasing a target of just 57, sunk to 31 for five before WG saw them to a five-wicket victory. Significantly, the animosity that arose from the Sydney Riot was overcome, this match helping to cement the custom of cricket tours between England and Australia.\nEngland in Australia 1878/9. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. One-off Test. Result: Australia win.\nAustralia in England 1880. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. One-off Test. Result: England win.\nLillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury's first tour 1881/2.\nAfter the 1876/7 tour Lillywhite invited Shaw to join him in promoting and managing a tour to Australia. Shaw was concerned that the financial burdens may be too great for two men, so Arthur Shrewsbury was brought in as a third backer. After Lord Harris's intervening tour, the three men put together their first tour to Australia in 1881, going via America. At the time Shaw was rated England's best defensive bowler and Shrewsbury England's best defensive batsmen. Lillywhite no longer played, but did umpire in a number of games. All the tourists were professional players.\nThey lost money on the American leg of the tour, and could only scrape together less than £1,000 to pay for their steamship journey to Sydney. This was made worse as the Americans refused to accept Bank of England banknotes as payment, and the captain of their ship, the \"SS Australia\", a Sydneysider himself, personally agreed to guarantee their fare.\nBetting scandals have been part of cricket from its earliest days, and it was in a match against Victoria before the first Test of the tour that they surfaced. There was very heavy betting on the match. Victoria needed 94 runs to win in the last innings when the tourists' boat was due to leave, meaning that the match would be a draw. The Victorians, anxious for a win, asked Shaw and Lillywhite to play out the game. They agreed, but only if the sailing of their boat was delayed till 7 pm after the match; to their surprise, the boat company consented. However, there were rumours that two Englishmen had tried to throw the game. In response Shaw bet £1 on an England victory and made every other member of his team do likewise. Remarkably, the Victorians were bowled out for 75, leaving Shaw's side the winner by 18 runs. But the rumours of match-fixing did not go away: On the boat journey to Adelaide, Billy Midwinter, who is the only man to play Test cricket for England against Australia and Australia against England, made accusations that led to a scuffle with the two men believed to have been implicated. Discretion from those reporting the tour means that the names of the alleged match-fixers cannot be identified with any certainty, but it was suggested that one of the players had dropped the simplest of catches, the other taken a catch only after the ball got into his shirtsleeve and became stuck.\nLater Shaw said, \"It was a remarkably curious circumstance.\" The \"Australasian\" wrote, \"Professional cricketers who keep late hours, make bets to some and are seen drinking champagne at an early hours with members of the betting tent cannot be surprised if people put a wrong construction on their conduct.\"\nWhen the Test matches were played, for the first time a South Australian, George Giffen, was selected to play. The first Test saw the biggest crowds then on record: 16,500 on the Saturday; 20,000 on the Monday and 10,000 on the Tuesday. England had the better of a game that was drawn after the fourth day as Shaw's side needed to catch a steamship for New Zealand at 6.30pm. Chasing 277 Australia had made 127 for 3 by the end of the game.\nIn the second Test, England made a tortuous 133 in 115 four-ball overs, with George 'Joey' Palmer taking 7 for 68. By close of play on the first day, Australia were in the driving seat at 86 for 1. Whilst England recovered to dismiss them for 197 and then made 232 themselves, they were never going to stop Australia getting the 169 runs they needed to win. The third Test was even more one-sided. England got 188. Then Australia made 262, with Percy McDonnell making 147, Alec Bannerman 70, and no other batsman scoring more than 7! England again collapsed to 134, and Australia won by 6 wickets.\nAlthough the fourth Test was billed as being \"timeless\", in practice, because of Shaw's team's other engagements, the game could only last four days. After three days only 22 wickets had fallen, with the most notable performance being a Test-career best 149 for George Ulyett. The fourth day of the fourth Test was wiped out by rain, and so the Test was drawn. The Englishmen went to their other commitments, and the Australians set sail to England.\nEngland in Australia 1881/2. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. Series result: Australia win 2–0.\nThe Ashes legend.\nAustralia win in England 1882.\nBilly Murdoch's Australian side played only one Test in their 1882 tour. As hosts, Surrey County Cricket Club asked A N Hornby to captain the side against them. It turned out to be Spofforth's match, however, as Australia's \"Demon bowler\" took fourteen wickets for ninety runs to bowl England out for 77 and give Australia victory by seven runs.\nThe rain-damaged pitch helped England's two left-arm bowlers, Barlow and Peate, who dismissed Australia for 63 in two-and-a-quarter hours. England made 101 in reply, with Spofforth taking 7 for 46. After more rain on the second day, Australia lifted its score to 122, thanks to a quickfire 55 from Massie. The match was fiercely contested, as evidenced by W. G. Grace's gamesmanship in running out the naïve 21-year-old Sammy Jones, who had been batting well with his captain. Murdoch hit one into the legside, and Jones reached the other end comfortably in time to make the single. He then left his crease to go and attend to a divot on the wicket. Grace whipped off the bails and appealed. Square-leg umpire Bob Thoms delivered his verdict: \"If you claim it, Sir! Out!\" Murdoch's protests fell on deaf ears; the run-out was quite legitimate, but Grace's unsporting behaviour irked the Australians, whose collective will to win was fired-up by it.\nDuring the interval, Spofforth made an announcement to his team-mates in the dressing-room: \"This thing can be done!\" In spite of being reduced to fifteen for two early on, England made a good start in its pursuit of a victory target of 85. The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: \"Now I was behind his arm; I could see his superb break-back. And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break I could see his right hand, at the end of the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through – and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There was the sense of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was half an hour ago, the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded.\"\nSpofforth presently claimed Ulyett, and Boyle had Grace caught by Bannerman at mid-off, making it 53 for four. Now, amidst great tension, Lucas and Lyttleton played out twelve maiden overs in succession. \"Suddenly\", wrote C. P. Moody (the man famous for compiling the first accepted list of Test matches), \"a new phase came over the innings. The batsmen could not get the ball past fieldsmen. Spofforth was bowling the most remarkable break-backs at tremendous pace; Boyle, from the other end, maintained a perfect length; Blackham with matchless skill took every ball that passed the batsmen ... every fieldsman strained his nerves to the utmost.\" It was now that Spofforth suggested to his captain Murdoch that they allow the batsmen to change ends. Alec Bannerman deliberately misfielded a stroke from Lyttleton, allowing the batsmen to take a single and end the monotony. \"Something of the spirit of the struggle\", wrote Moody, \"pervaded the thousands of spectators, and their oppressive silence was punctuated by a mighty shout when Lyttleton broke the spell with a single.\" This meant that Spofforth could now have a go at him. After four more runless overs, Spofforth knocked over Lyttleton's stumps. That made it 66 for five, England needing nineteen more to win.\n\"I observed the incoming batsmen\", Tom Horan wrote later. \"They had ashen faces and parched lips.\".\" England had collapsed to 75 for 8, at which time Charles Studd, a batsman who had twice scored centuries against the Australians that summer arrived at the wicket. Studd had earlier been seen shivering, covered in a blanket in the pavilion. Studd denied the story that was put about that he was the victim of nerves, saying that he was cold due to the freezing weather.\n\"Now Boyle's pertinacious accuracy was rewarded\", wrote Moody. \"Off the first ball of his over Barnes was caught off the glove by Murdoch at point.\" Last man Ted Peate came to the wicket now. \"The scorer's hand shook so that he wrote Peate's name like 'Geese'\", Horan tells us. Unfortunately, this can not be verified, as the England scorecard has been lost, and the Australian one reads very clearly and certainly does not say \"Geese\".\n\"Peate\", wrote Moody, \"swished the first ball to leg for two, flukily played the next one, tried to hit the last ball of the over, but missed, and it bowled him. The game was won by seven runs.\" Studd had not faced a delivery. Peate later explained his actions, although there are numerous accounts of his actual words. Thankfully, they do not vary much from \"Ah couldn't troost Maister Stood!\"\nOne spectator died of heart failure at the end of the Australian innings (rather than during the tense finishing stages, as has often been claimed); another is said to have bitten through his brother-in-law's umbrella handle. For the first time, an England side had lost a Test match in England.\nSpofforth, having taken seven for 44 in this innings (making it fourteen for ninety in the match), bowled his last eleven overs for two runs and four wickets, those two runs and four wickets coming off his last seven deliveries. He was carried shoulder-high from the field. His break-backs had been almost unplayable on this wicket; indeed, Giffen believed that every single one of them would have destroyed the stumps had not the bat got in the way.\nAfter the match, a mock obituary was famously inserted in the \"Sporting Times\", which read:\nAustralia in England 1882. Match length: 3 days. Balls per over: 4. One-off Test. Result: Australia win.\nBligh reclaims the Ashes 1882/3.\nBligh originally intended to tour Australia in 1882/3 with a team consisting only of Cambridge University cricketers. (Oxford and Cambridge Universities had very highly rated teams at the time.) This plan did not come fully to fruition, however, and Bligh ended up taking a team of eight amateurs and four professionals on the long voyage. Bligh was contracted to play three games against the same team that had beaten A N Hornby's side in England during the 1882 season, and he responded to the joke about the Ashes at dinner parties by saying his team would \"beard the kangaroo in his den and try and recover \"those\" ashes\". In response, at a banquet at the Melbourne Town Hall, Australian captain Billy Murdoch said, \"Our boys fairly won the ashes and we confidently rely on them to retain possession or at least for the present. When, as we hope, we have shown our visitors that they cannot recover the ashes, we can then place the sacred dust in a suitable urn in our Public Library, as a curiosity to be shown to visitors with respect and esteem as the result of the Australian prowess in the cricket field.\"\nWhilst Bligh's team was strong, it did miss three or four of the leading English cricketers, most notably WG Grace. On the way to Australia the side also survived a collision between their vessel, the \"SS Peshawaur\" and the \"Glen Roy\" 500 km south of Colombo. Fast bowler Fred Morley suffered a broken rib and severe bruising, which limited his appearances on the tour and contributed to his early death two years later. Walter Read had this to say: \"It was altogether a terrible affair, and it is a wonder we were not all drowned.\"\nThe first two representative games were styled as the \"Honourable Ivo Bligh's Team versus Mr Murdoch's XI\". The Aussies took £200 per player in each of these games as record-breaking crowds poured into the M.C.G., and the New Year's Day attendance was 23,000. The highlight of the first Test was an innings of 85 in 135 minutes from George Bonnor as Australia made 291 in its first innings. Rain came down during the England innings, making the pitch more difficult than it had been. England, struggling to cope with this, made only 177 and was forced to follow on 114 runs behind. Mr Murdoch's XI won easily by 9 wickets, and the Colonial press saw the victory as confirmation of Australia's superiority. Bligh, however, later commented, \"Some of us still cherished the hope that our turn was yet to come.\"\nThe second game was more controversial. As the pitch deteriorated there were arguments as to which bowlers were responsible for encroaching onto it. When Bates, an occasional spin bowler on the tour, took England's first Test cricket hat-trick, there were suggestions that he had been aided by Barlow's footmarks. Bligh asked Barlow to change his shoes to pacify things, although the English later accused Spofforth of damaging the pitch too. Bligh's success at the toss helped England enormously, however, and Australia capitulated to an innings defeat.\nAfter the controversy in the second Test at Melbourne, it was agreed to use two pitches at Sydney in the third match of the series, which stood at one-all now. After winning the toss, England made 247, and Australia replied with 218. In the latter innings, Alec Bannerman batted just over four hours to score 94. Figures of seven for 44 from Fred Spofforth saw England collapse to 123, before Dick Barlow's seven for 40 had the Australians collapsing themselves to 83 and losing by 69 runs. Bligh had won the three match series 2–1, and England's pride was restored.\nA fourth match was played against a \"United Australian XI\", which was even stronger than Murdoch's team that had lost the Ashes. As an experiment, a separate pitch was prepared for each innings. Australia won the game by 4 wickets, but it was (and still is) not recognised as a part of the Ashes series of 1882/83. England won the toss once again and batted first, 135 Allan Steel scoring 135 to see the tourists to 263. Australia's response was one less at 262, but England's 197 in the second innings did not set much of a target, and Australia won comfortably. A fifth match was proposed and discussed, but it did not materialise.\nEngland in Australia 1882/3. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. Series result: England win 2–1.\nEngland in Australia 1882/3. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. One-off Test. Result: Australia won.\n\"Continued on: History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889)\""

        "title": "Rugby Southland",
        "text": "Rugby Southland (formerly the Southland Rugby Football Union) is the provincial rugby union who govern the Southland region of New Zealand. Their headquarters are at Rugby Park Stadium in Invercargill, which is also the home ground of the union's professional team, the Southland Stags who compete in the Mitre 10 Cup Championship Division and challenge for the Ranfurly Shield.\nDespite their proud history, no Southland team has ever won the top division of the New Zealand National Provincial Championship since organised competition began in 1976. However, they have won the NPC second division title five times and held the Ranfurly Shield seven times, most recently in 2011 where they defended the shield twice before losing it to Taranaki. Southland also plays for the Donald Stuart Memorial Shield against rivals Otago in what is the longest tenured provincial rivalry in New Zealand first-class rugby, with 229 matches.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years.\nFounded in 1887 after splitting from Otago, Southland and its former stablemate went on to forge what is New Zealand's longest inter-provincial rugby rivalries. The two sides have played more games against each other than any other representative teams in New Zealand. They played their first game against Otago, losing in a close affair. The Southland region already had strong club rugby teams with Invercargill competing in the Dunedin based competition. The Invercargill club had already produced two All Blacks. They were outside back, Henry Braddon and wing forward, James O'Donnell. In 1885 these two players were recognised as Otago All Blacks as they played their rugby for neighbouring province.\nIt was not until 1896 when Southland hooker, Nisbet McRobie was selected in the New Zealand team to play Queensland. The side won 9-nil and it was McRobie's only game in the 'black jersey', however he occupies a special place in Southland Rugby history as the provinces first of over 50 All Blacks. Billy Stead became the provinces first test All Black in 1903 and also captained the All Blacks 12 times.\nProduction of talent.\nSouthland is renowned for producing a high number of quality players despite the small population of the province shown by the over 50 All Blacks who have come from Southland. This continued following the war with players such as Leo Connolly and Jack Hazlett followed by Leicester Rutledge and Frank Oliver. But as rugby in New Zealand was organised into structured annual competition to replace tours and series which Southland had played in previously Southland Rugby struggled to retain their local talent. With Southland in the NPC Second Division from 1976, talented Southlanders began heading north in search of top level rugby. Southland continued to produce homegrown talent over 1980s and 1990s which led them to five Second Division titles, namely Brian McKechnie, Steven Pokere, Geoff Valli, Paul Henderson and Simon Culhane who was the shining light for Southland over this period, it was the talent that was lost that continues to haunt Southland fans. Southland at this time was used as a kickstart for many successful players careers. Valli moved to North Auckland in 1981, Pokere left Southland for Auckland in 1984 and Henderson spent what most consider to be his best years as a footballer in Otago from 1987-91. This worsened as Southland neared the millennium and led to embarrassing results where victories were few and far between as Southland was promoted to the NPC First Division after their 1996 championship.\nConsidered one of Southland's best ever athletes, it pains many Southland fans to think that Jeff Wilson played only a season for Southland whilst still attending Cargill High School before heading to Otago to attend university and play his provincial rugby and cricket both of which he would represent New Zealand in before turning 20, going on to play 60 tests for the All Blacks. Justin Marshall who was Southland's halfback left after the winning the 1994 Second Division title and went on to become one of New Zealand's greatest halfbacks playing 81 All Black tests from 1995-2005 and winning every major trophy in New Zealand rugby excluding a Rugby World Cup. 2002 Southland captain Corey Flynn left the province for Canterbury and the Crusaders in 2003 and went on to play 70 games for Canterbury, 150 for the Crusaders and 15 for the All Blacks which would have been far greater if not for multiple broken arms from 2003-2014.\nOthers who kickstarted their career in Southland before moving where they became All Blacks Norm Hewitt, Pita Alatini, David Hill and Paul Miller. All Blacks such as Anton Oliver, Damian McKenzie and Mils Muliaina (with the latter going on to become the second ever All Blacks centurion), who left the province for their schooling would not return with rugby's increasing professionalism to represent the province like their family had in the past.\nIn recent years such as 2021, Ethan De Groot has played three tests for the All Blacks\nSouthland vs international teams.\nFor a province of its size, Southland's record against international teams is unmatched. Rugby Park has not been a happy hunting ground for foreign sides many of whom have come to grief at the hands of determined Southland sides over the years. Australian national and state sides have had a particularly miserable time in Invercargill, losing on 13 occasions. The British Lions were defeated in 1950 and 1966 and France were put away in 1979 and 1989 along with Italy more recently in 2003.\nRanfurly Shield.\nSouthland were the first South Island province to win the coveted Ranfurly Shield in 1920 when they beat Wellington. Their first shield reign was brief, losing the Shield back to Wellington in 1921 after two defences. They next won the Shield in 1929 off Wairarapa, this time defending it four times before again losing to Wellington. Southland then won the Ranfurly Shield in 1937 and 1938 when they retained the Shield for 12 challenges before losing it to bitter rivals Otago in 1947. With Ranfurly Shield rugby not played from 1939 to 1945 due to World War II, Southland's nine years with the Shield remains the longest in terms of time period although it did reside under a bed for much of this time. The Southland side during this period boasted All Blacks George Purdue, Bill Hazlett, Art Wesney, Les George and All Black Captains Frank Kilby and Brushy Mitchell in the Shield winning sides.\nTheir next Shield victory over Taranaki in 1959 would be their last for 51 years before the 2009 Southland side broke the drought by beating Canterbury 9-3 in Christchurch. Their six defences of the Shield proved to be some of the more iconic Shield games in the professional era including a 16-12 victory over arch-rivals Otago in front of a sold-out Rugby Park, and a 9-6 victory over Auckland days after the biggest snow storm ever recorded in the province led to fans having to shovel snow off the field the day before the game. After losing the Shield to Canterbury, the Stags again claimed the shield from their South Island rivals in 2011 in their most recent tenure which lasted two games. These Southland sides were not headlined by regular All Blacks like the teams from the 1930s and 1940s, instead they were made up mostly of locally grown talent educated at Southland Boys' High School such as captain Jamie Mackintosh, centurions Jason Rutledge, David Hall, Josh Bekhuis and Tim Boys, and future Scotland international John Hardie.\nName change.\nIn 1998 the Southland Rugby Football Union Incorporated changed its name to Rugby Southland Incorporated\nClub rugby.\nWhen Robert Galbraith stepped down as the Southland Rugby Football Union secretary the union handed him a donation which the long-serving Southland rugby administrator promptly spent on a shield he donated back to the union as a prize for Invercargill's top club rugby competition. The Galbraith Shield has been the prize for Southland's premier club rugby competition since 1908.\nThere are seven teams currently in Southland's premier competition; Marist, Blues, Pirates-Old Boys, Star, Woodlands, Midlands and the Eastern-Northern Barbarians whose players come from the clubs in the Eastern/Northern sub union.\nCurrent Senior Clubs:\n1 Wakatipu play in the Otago Country competition, however due to lack of suitable competition their B team play in the Southlandwide competition as the Wakatipu Wanderers. Wakatipu High School also compete in Southland competition as it involves less travel than the corresponding Otago competition.\n2 Wrights Bush do not currently have their own senior team, instead playing as \"Bush Pirates\" in a combined venture with Central Pirates.\nGalbraith Shield Champions.\n2 - Collegiate\n1953, 1965. \n1 - Winton 1909\n1 - Waikiwi 1910\n1 - Athletic 1918\n1 - Tokanui 1978.\nSouthland in Super Rugby.\nSouthland are one of three home unions to make up the Highlanders Super Rugby team, the other two unions being Otago and North Otago. There is currently an agreement in place for the Highlanders to play one regular season game per year at Rugby Park Stadium. Despite their interests in the Highlanders, Southland players are free to play for whichever Super team contracts them, with those who aren't contracted often representing the Highlanders development team known as the Bravehearts. This has seen players such as former player Wharenui Hawera represent the ACT Brumbies. The players from the 2021 Stags squad with Super Rugby experience are:\nHonours.\nCaptains.\nSouthland's Captains since 1976 are:\nCoaches.\nSouthland's Coaches Since 1976 are:\nRugby Southland centurions.\nThe following players have played over a hundred games for the Southland senior team.

        "text": "A swimming hole is a place in a river, stream, creek, spring, or similar natural body of water, which is large enough and deep enough for a person to swim in. Common usage usually refers to fresh, moving water and thus not to oceans or lakes.\nIn the UK swimming at natural swimming holes has a long history and has recently become known as \"wild swimming\", especially since the publication of bestselling books on the subject by Kate Rew and Daniel Start. In southern Australia, a compendium of swimming holes was first characterised by Brad Neal in his 2004 publication of the first edition of the Guide to Freshwater Swimming Holes in Victoria, Australia.\nNude swimming is a well-established tradition at some more remote swimming holes and is an attraction for many natural swimming fans, but in many parts of the world remains an illegal activity.\nHistory.\nIn Europe, as the nineteenth century dawned, a new era of contemporary artists were rediscovering the appeal of the swimming hole. The waterfall, surrounded by trees and mountains, was now regarded as the quintessence of beauty. William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas de Quincey spent much time bathing in the mountain pools of the Lake District. The study and search for the ‘picturesque’ and ‘sublime’ – an almost scientific measure of loveliness and proportion in the landscape – had reached epidemic proportions. The fashionable tours of Provence or Tuscany were replaced by trips to the valleys of Wales, and the dales of the UK's Cumbria and Yorkshire, as Turner and Constable painted a prodigious flow of falls, tarns and ponds.\nIn southern Australia, swimming in natural swimming holes was popular until around the time of the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. In the first half of the 20th century there were several swimming clubs along the Yarra River in Melbourne, such as at Deep Rock, for example. Numerous chlorinated, municipal swimming pools were built across Victoria in the lead up to the 1956 Olympics, which changed the community's swimming preferences to the local pool, rather than the local river. The swimming clubs along the Yarra River closed in response to this change in preferences. Some of these pre-Olympic swimming pools still exist, such as at Hepburn Pool in central Victoria, and Seven Creeks in Euroa.\nSafety.\nSafety is a concern with swimming in natural settings. Typically there are no lifeguards. Currents can be swift and, in larger rivers, are often hidden beneath the surface. Diving or jumping is especially dangerous as the depth varies from season to season, and there may be hidden rocks below the surface resulting in broken necks or backs and paralysis or death. \nAlcohol consumption while swimming is especially dangerous, and contributes to at least 20% of deaths by drowning.\nExternal links.\nFor Australian swimming holes there is an online guide http://wildswimmingaustralia.com and an alternative guide at https://swimmingholeheaven.com/australia.htm.

        "title": "Brad Daugherty (basketball)",
        "text": "Bradley Lee Daugherty (born October 19, 1965), nicknamed “The Big Train\", is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels and professionally with the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nDaugherty is a co-owner of NASCAR Cup Series team JTG Daugherty Racing. Daugherty's race teams have won in the Truck Series, Xfinity Series and the Cup Series including the 2023 Daytona 500. He is also an analyst for NASCAR on NBC.\nAmateur career.\nDaugherty played basketball at Charles D. Owen High School in Black Mountain, North Carolina, where he led the Warhorses to the 1982 state finals. Daugherty accepted a scholarship to play at the University of North Carolina under legendary college basketball coach Dean Smith.\nDaugherty was one of the greatest big men ever to play at the University of North Carolina. He entered college as a 16-year-old freshman and was a two-time All-ACC first team selection, and a first team All-American in 1986. He was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team in 2002 and was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. Daugherty averaged more than twenty points per game in his senior season.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Cavaliers (1986–1996).\nDaugherty was taken as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1986 NBA draft. Cleveland had obtained the rights to the first pick in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers for Roy Hinson and cash. The Cavaliers also drafted Ron Harper with the eighth pick in the 1986 draft and obtained the rights to Mark Price (in a trade with the Dallas Mavericks) the 25th pick (second round). Harper, Price and Daugherty, along with fellow rookie John \"Hot Rod\" Williams immediately began to pay dividends for Cleveland. Daugherty, Williams, and Harper were all named to the 1986–87 All-Rookie team.\nDaugherty averaged nineteen points and ten rebounds per game over eight seasons in the NBA and retired as the Cavaliers all-time leading scorer (10,389 points) and rebounder (5,227). Daugherty's all time-leading scorer record stood until March 21, 2008, when LeBron James broke the point record against the Toronto Raptors. His leading rebounder record stood until December 9, 2008, when Žydrūnas Ilgauskas broke the rebound record, again against the Raptors. He played in 41 postseason games and led the Cavaliers as far as the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. Brad was a five time All-Star (1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993). As part of the Cavaliers' 30th anniversary in 1999–2000, Daugherty was a unanimous selection to the All-Time Cleveland Cavalier team.\nDaugherty's career in the NBA was cut short at the age of 28 because of recurring back troubles. He never played another game after the 1993–94 season, though he did make one appearance in uniform for the Whoopi Goldberg movie \"Eddie\" along with teammates Hot Rod Williams, John Battle, Terrell Brandon, and Bobby Phills. After two consecutive seasons of inactivity, he announced his retirement after the 1995–96 season. His #43 jersey, a number he picked as a tribute to NASCAR legend Richard Petty (whom Daugherty lists as his favorite sportsman) was retired by the Cavaliers on March 1, 1997.\nPost-basketball career.\nDaugherty's business interests include car dealerships, waste management and commercial real estate. He is also a college basketball analyst and is a NASCAR broadcaster for NBC. For one season, he was a color commentator, alongside Michael Reghi, for Cleveland Cavaliers telecasts. He is active in many charities including hosting the Presbyterian Home for Children's annual golf tournament, which raises money in support of the home, located in Black Mountain. He also has sponsored an annual scholarship to help a child from Presbyterian Home receive a higher education. At UNC, he has given to the Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History and has served on the Board of Visitors and the athletic council of the General Alumni Association Board.\nFollowing his retirement from the NBA, Daugherty co-owned the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series team Liberty Racing, featuring such drivers as Kenny Irwin Jr. and Kevin Harvick. In 1997 Irwin won two Craftsman Truck Series races driving for Daugherty (Homestead-Miami Speedway in March and Texas Motor Speedway in June). Daugherty joined ESPN's return to NASCAR racing telecasts in 2007. He was an analyst on the weekly topical show \"Inside NASCAR\" on Showtime, and on \"NASCAR Now\", a nightly newscast on the sport. He is also part owner of JTG Daugherty Racing, which owns the No. 47 Camaro ZL1 1LE driven by Ricky Stenhouse Jr. The team's first win came in 2014 at Watkins Glen International with A.J. Allmendinger driving the No. 47 Chevrolet. Their second win came in the 2023 Daytona 500 with Ricky Stenhouse Jr. winning. With the win, Daugherty became the first black principal owner to win the Daytona 500.\nIn November 2014, Daugherty began as an NBA and college basketball analyst for ESPN.\nAfter years of animosity for the team's handling of his close friend and former General Manager Wayne Embry, Daugherty joined Fox Sports Ohio for select Cavaliers telecasts in the 2019–20 season as part of the franchise's 50th season celebration.\nOn July 28, 2020, Daugherty became an analyst for \"NASCAR on NBC\" from the first Michigan International Speedway race onwards. Daugherty also served as a roaming reporter for CBS Sports coverage of the 2021 SRX Series.\nOn August 20, 2020, Daugherty represented the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2020 NBA draft Lottery.\nDaugherty is currently a part of the Cavaliers broadcast team alongside his NASCAR team ownership."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2005)",
        "text": "The 2005 Royal Rumble was the 18th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on January 30, 2005, at the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2005 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either Raw's World Heavyweight Championship or SmackDown!'s WWE Championship at WrestleMania 21.\nFive professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main event was the 2005 Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from both brands. Raw's Batista, the 28th entrant, won the match by last eliminating SmackDown!'s John Cena, the 25th entrant. The primary match on the Raw brand was Triple H versus Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Triple H won by pinfall to retain the title. The primary match on the SmackDown! brand was a triple threat match for the WWE Championship between reigning champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), Kurt Angle, and Big Show, which JBL won by pinning Angle. No tag team match was featured on the card, which made this the first PPV since The Wrestling Classic in 1985 to not include one.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2005 event was the 18th Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 30, 2005, at the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2005, the winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's World Heavyweight Championship or SmackDown!'s WWE Championship at WrestleMania 21.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised five matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters to build tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, with storylines produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nThe main feud heading into the Royal Rumble on the Raw brand was between Triple H and Randy Orton over the World Heavyweight Championship. Their feud started on the August 16 episode of \"Raw\", when Orton was kicked out of Evolution by Triple H. At Unforgiven, Triple H defeated Orton to win the World Heavyweight Championship after interference from Evolution members Batista and Ric Flair. At Survivor Series, Team Orton (Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven) defeated Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista, and Snitsky) in a traditional Survivor Series elimination match to earn control of \"Raw\" after Orton last eliminated Triple H. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won an Elimination Chamber match to win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship by last eliminating Orton after interference from Batista and Flair. On the January 10 episode of \"Raw\", Orton defeated Batista to become the number one contender for the title at the Royal Rumble. On the January 17 episode of \"Raw\", after a verbal confrontation between the two in the arena, Triple H ambushed Orton backstage. They fought until Orton tried to use a steel chair, and Triple H fled. On the January 24 episode of \"Raw\", Orton defeated Flair, despite interference from Triple H.\nThe main feud on the SmackDown! brand was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), The Big Show, and Kurt Angle, with the three feuding over the WWE Championship. On the December 16 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Angle challenged JBL to a match for the WWE Championship. The Cabinet (Orlando Jordan, Doug, and Danny Basham) interfered and attacked Angle, causing the match to end via disqualification. They continued to attack Angle after the match until Big Show came out, beat down everyone, and signaled to JBL that he wanted the title. On the December 30 episode of \"SmackDown!\", a triple threat match for the title between the three was booked for the Royal Rumble. Following this, JBL set up Angle to anger Big Show, but Angle angered JBL in response. After realizing this, on the January 20 episode of \"SmackDown!\", JBL aligned himself with Big Show and confronted Angle; however, JBL turned on Big Show and beat him down with Angle. On the January 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\", SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long booked a Last Man Standing match between JBL and Angle for later that night. The two eventually turned on each other, and the match ended in a no contest. It was later revealed that the match was Big Show's idea.\nAnother feud heading into the event from SmackDown! was between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. Their feud first started at No Mercy when Heidenreich helped John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) defeat The Undertaker in a Last Ride match by attacking The Undertaker and putting him in the hearse. At Survivor Series, The Undertaker defeated Heidenreich after executing a Tombstone Piledriver. At Armageddon, Heidenreich once again cost The Undertaker the WWE Championship against JBL after interfering in a fatal four-way match that involved Booker T and Eddie Guerrero, allowing JBL to pin Booker T to retain. SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long let The Undertaker name the stipulation for his match against Heidenreich at the Royal Rumble. As Heidenreich mentioned his fear of caskets, The Undertaker chose to face him in a casket match for the Royal Rumble their first casket match at the event since the 1998 event involved with Shawn Michaels and the third occurrence the other was in the 1994 event involved with Yokozuna.\nA preliminary Raw brand feud was between Shawn Michaels and Edge. Their feud started at Taboo Tuesday when Michaels was voted over Edge and Chris Benoit to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship while Edge and Benoit were put into a World Tag Team Championship match against La Résistance. During the tag team title match, an angry Edge abandoned Benoit, which Benoit eventually won for his team, and instead interfered in the World Heavyweight Championship match, costing Michaels the championship. At New Year's Revolution, Edge competed in an Elimination Chamber match for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship with Michaels as the special guest referee. During the match, Edge accidentally speared Michaels, resulting in Michaels performing Sweet Chin Music on Edge, who would be eliminated by Chris Jericho. On the January 10 episode of \"Raw\", a confrontation between Edge and Michaels ended in the two men brawling around the arena. A match between the two was then booked for the Royal Rumble.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, Maven defeated Rhyno in a match taped for \"Sunday Night Heat\".\nThe first match was between Edge and Shawn Michaels. Edge mocked Michaels by performing some of Michaels' signature taunts. Edge gained the advantage after an Edge-O-Matic on the floor. Edge performed a spear on the floor on Michaels; in the ring, Edge executed another spear on Michaels for a near-fall. After countering Edge, Michaels executed a diving elbow drop on Edge. Edge countered Sweet Chin Music into an electric chair drop for a near-fall. Edge applied the Edgecator on Michaels, but Michaels broke the hold. Michaels attempted a roll-up, but Edge pinned Michaels with a roll-up using the ropes to win the match.\nThe second match was a Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match started back and forth until Heidenreich sent Undertaker into the casket. Undertaker applied the triangle choke until Gene Snitsky interfered and attacked Undertaker. Snitsky and Heidenreich attacked The Undertaker and called for the casket to be opened but Kane was revealed to be inside the casket. He attacked Snitsky and Heidenreich and fought Snitsky throughout the arena. Heidenreich sent Undertaker into the steel steps and pushed the casket into him. Heidenreich put Undertaker in the casket after applying the cobra clutch but Undertaker stopped the lid from closing. Heidenreich put Undertaker in the casket again but Undertaker countered. Undertaker executed a chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver and put Heidenreich in the casket to win the match.\nThe third match was a triple threat match for the WWE Championship between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), The Big Show, and Kurt Angle. Angle stayed on the outside of the ring as Big Show and JBL fought. After Angle broke up a pinfall attempt, Big Show attacked both men. Angle hit Big Show with a television monitor, causing him to fall through a broadcast announce table. Later, Big Show executed a chokeslam on JBL but JBL placed his foot on the ropes to void the pinfall. Big Show tackled JBL through the barricade and performed a flapjack to Angle onto a chair. Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak and Doug and Danny Basham attacked Big Show as Orlando Jordan helped JBL back into the ring. JBL executed a Clothesline from Hell on Angle to retain the title.\nThe fourth match was between Triple H and Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff banned Evolution (Batista and Ric Flair) from ringside. Orton had the advantage until Triple H countered an RKO by throwing Orton out of the ring. Triple H kept the advantage and targeted Orton's left knee until Orton knocked him into a broadcast table. Orton kept the advantage until he missed a DDT. Triple H knocked both Orton and the referee down with a clothesline and tried to hit Orton with a sledgehammer but Orton pulled him into the ringpost. Triple H performed another clothesline and a Pedigree to retain the title.\nMain event match.\nThe main event was the Royal Rumble match. Before the match, Kurt Angle attacked Nunzio, stole his entrance number and replaced him in the match. The participants divided into their brands and fought against each other, working together to eliminate Muhammad Hassan, the thirteen entrant (who had garnered heat at the time). Scotty 2 Hotty, the fifteenth entrant, was attacked by Hassan during his entrance and never entered the match. Angle, the twentieth entrant, dominated upon entering until Shawn Michaels eliminated him. Angle came back to eliminate Michaels and attacked him. The final four participants remaining were Batista, John Cena, Edge, and Rey Mysterio. Edge fought with Mysterio, executing a spear to eliminate Mysterio. Cena and Batista then eliminated Edge as he was attacking them. Cena tried to perform an FU on Batista but Batista countered. Batista then attempted a Batista Bomb, but was countered with a headscissors takedown by Cena, sending both over the top rope and touching the floor at the same time. The referees for the Raw brand believed Batista to be the winner while the SmackDown! referees believed Cena to be winner. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came to the ring, in the process legitimately tearing both his quadriceps muscles when his knees were caught on the apron, with the planned finish and attempt to restart the match botched, and ordered the match to be restarted with the final two participants. Batista eliminated Cena following a spinebuster to win the match.\nAftermath.\nThe following weeks on \"Raw\" surrounded Batista's choice of which champion to face at WrestleMania 21. Triple H devised a scheme to have Batista almost run over by a limousine resembling John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL)'s, so Batista would challenge JBL instead of himself. Batista became aware of the scheme and chose to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania, thus leaving the Evolution stable in the process. He won the title, and their feud continued until he was drafted to SmackDown! on June 30. Batista remained champion until the January 13, 2006, episode of \"SmackDown!\" when he vacated the title due to injury.\nJohn Cena went on to win a tournament to become the number one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 21. The tournament concluded in a match between him and Kurt Angle at No Way Out, which Cena won after performing an FU. Following this, he began an angle with JBL. Cena defeated JBL to win the title at WrestleMania, and their feud ended after Cena retained the title in an \"I Quit\" match at Judgment Day. Cena would then go to hold on to the title until New Year's Revolution 2006 when Edge cashed in the Money in the Bank contract he won at Wrestlemania 21 and defeat Cena after an Elimination Chamber match.\nFollowing the Royal Rumble, Randy Orton and Kurt Angle began feuding with The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels, respectively. The Big Show faced JBL in the first ever barbed wire Steel Cage match for the title at No Way Out, which JBL won to retain the title. Orton briefly feuded with Christian before moving on to feud with The Undertaker, which spanned nine months. After losing his title match at No Way Out, The Big Show faced Akebono in a sumo match at WrestleMania, and he briefly feuded with Carlito afterwards.\nDuring the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery in June, the World Heavyweight Championship and WWE Championship switched brands.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nScotty was attacked by Hassan before he made it to the ring, and therefore was unable to compete and never officially entered the match.\nKurt Angle had been eliminated by Shawn Michaels and then returned to the ring, and eliminated Michaels in retaliation."

The organization puts together an annual football tournament where teams of homeless people from various countries compete.\nThe tournament was first held in 1999, and in 2008 it added a women's competition. From 2010 onwards, all tournaments have featured both men's and women's teams.\nHistory.\nThe Homeless World Cup organization was co-founded by Mel Young and Harald Schmied in 2001 to advocate for a global solution to homelessness. The first annual football tournament for homeless people took place in 2003 in Graz, Austria. Host cities since then have included Gothenburg, Edinburgh, Copenhagen, Cape Town, Melbourne, Milan, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, Poznań, Santiago, Amsterdam, Glasgow, Oslo and Mexico City. Most recently, the 2019 edition was hosted by Wales in Bute Park, Cardiff, with Michael Sheen opening the tournament.\nThe 2020 tournament had been due to take place in Tampere, Finland, but was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe international headquarters of the Homeless World Cup is located at 1 Broughton Market, in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nNational partners.\nThe Homeless World Cup organization operates through a network of more than 80 national partners around the world, supporting football programs and social enterprise development.\nMembers.\n2005 :100 million homeless + 1.6 billion lack adequate housing.\nRegions.\n69 Nations in October 2023:\nFormat.\nFields.\nSince 2015 the tournament has been played on synthetic turf fields from Act Global.\nRules.\nPlayer eligibility.\nPlayers must meet all of the following criteria:\nAlso, must be any of the following:\nParticipants.\nA maximum of 4 players per team on the court:\nTournament details.\nThe winning team gets 3 points.

A member of the International Cricket Council since 1952, it represents the country's men's and women's national teams in international cricket tournaments played under the ICC.\nFollowing the establishment of Pakistan as an independent dominion of the British Empire in 1947, professional and amateur cricket commenced in the same year, seeing as local infrastructure had already been established when the country was part of the British Raj. Cricket matches were arranged informally until 1948, when a Board of Control was formally instituted. Pakistan was admitted to the Imperial Cricket Conference (currently known as International Cricket Council) in July 1952, and has since been a full member, playing Test cricket. The team's first Test series took place in India between October and December 1952.\nInaugural Board of Control.\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board was inaugurated on 1 May 1949 as the Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan (BCCP). The first meeting, held in the committee rooms of Lahore Gymkhana, saw HE Iftikhar Hussain Khan Mamdot, the Nawab of Mamdot, made president and chairman, with Justice A. R. Cornelius as one of three vice-presidents. The following year, Cornelius became chairman of the working committee, until he relinquished his connection with the board in early 1953.\nThe working chairman was always one of the three vice-presidents. In April 1957, Ayub Khan imposed three more new vice-presidents (himself being one of them). Then between December 1958 and September 1969 the post of vice-president disappeared.\nCommittees.\nThe response to turmoil within the board has on four occasions been to suspend the rules and appoint an ad hoc committee. The first ad hoc committee was appointed in September 1960 and did not disband until May 1963 having created a new constitution. The President of Pakistan would now nominate the board president who would in turn nominate the other members of the executive committee to sit for a period of three years. Representatives of the four provincial cricket associations and Government departments formed the executive committee.\nThe BCCP was re-organised in the 1970s and was headed by former cricketers, professional administrators and trustees, who were often businessmen. In November 1976 players' demands for increased salaries reached a crisis and the Pakistan Sports Board took over running the B.C.C.P.'s affairs. Long-serving president, the formidable Kardar, was in the thick of the dispute. The revolt against Kardar forced him to resign in May 1977 and led to a new Ad Hoc Committee replacing the Board Council in 1978 running Pakistan cricket and again changing the constitution. Provincial Cricket Associations were eliminated and divisional and city CAs became members, giving most of the influence to the city Cricket Association of Lahore and Karachi.\nThe Board now governed a network of teams sponsored by corporations and banks, city associations and clubs. There is no province-based official team type organisation of domestic cricket in Pakistan and Lahore and Karachi cities are the two top tiers of all cricket, including reservoirs of fresh talent.\nPakistan cricket was involved by dissension and controversies over the national team's poor performance during the tour of India and a public uproar forced the end of the Ad Hoc Committee. The chairman and team captain Asif Iqbal had to step down. Air Marshal Nur Khan now became chairman and he saw the banks and other organisations increase their participation on the Board Council in the face of protests from the zonal organisations.\nA third ad hoc committee under Javed Burki took charge of BCCP affairs in January 1994 and made a new constitution including giving a new name, the Pakistan Cricket Board (P.C.B.) It introduced a chairman and chief executive.\nAfter taking heavy criticism on the grounds of corruption and match fixing, the Board was taken over by a fourth Ad Hoc Committee formed on 17 July 1999 which remains in place despite undertakings from Musharraf to bring it to an end. The Pakistan Cricket Board re-emerged by taking the initiative to sponsor the hugely successful 2004 tour of Pakistan by their rivals India. The Pakistan Cricket Board has competed and has associated itself with the Twenty20 cricket form and has also proven popular and hopes to similarly revive popular interest in domestic games. However, Pakistan's early exit from the 2007 World Cup cast a shadow and later Dr. Nasim Ashraf's resigned at the end of 2008.\nEjaz Butt was named the PCB Chairman in October 2008. Zaka Ashraf took over from Butt in October 2011.\nOn 28 May 2013, Zaka Ashraf was suspended as PCB Chairman by Islamabad High Court due to a dubious election. The newly sworn in Government of Nawaz Sharif named Najam Sethi as acting PCB Chairman. On 15 October 2013, the governing council of the Pakistan Cricket Board was dissolved by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, and an interim five man management committee was named consisting of acting chairman Najam Sethi‚ Shahryar Khan, two former players (Zaheer Abbas and Haroon Rasheed, and former team manager Naveed Cheema.\nOn 15 January 2014, Zaka Ashraf was reinstated as PCB Chairman. The PML-N Government was unhappy with the reinstatement (since Ashraf was a PPP appointee), and this led to Ashraf's sacking. In February, PCB Governing Board was dissolved and an eight-member management committee (comprising Shakil Sheikh, Shaharyar Khan, Zaheer Abbas, Iqbal Qasim, Naveed Akram Cheema, Yusaf Naseem Khokar and Faridullah Khan, the secretary IPC). Najam Sethi was elected as chairman by the management committee.\nDomestic cricket.\nThe structure of domestic cricket in Pakistan at the highest level has changed many times since 1947 with the latest restructure being enforced in 2019. Previously domestic cricket operated with departmental, city and regional teams - a set up encouraged by Abdul Hafeez Kardar. Since 1947, the domestic first class cricket system has varied considerably per year with teams ranging from 7 to 26 and tournament matches operating under different formats (often changes occurred every year). With the advent of domestic List A and T20 forms of cricket in the 1970s and 2000s, there has been no consistent set up (as has been noted for first class cricket in Pakistan). Historically, school and club cricket has also suffered due to inconsistencies in top tier domestic cricket. The consistent changes in the domestic structure and the gradual introduction of departmental teams was encouraged as it provided permanent jobs to players. Matches were rarely televised due to lack of quality cricket and lack of interest in departmental cricket. This inconsistent system was widely criticised on the basis of low quality cricket and reduced competition.\nIn 2019, six regional teams were created on provincial lines. The teams would compete in the principal competitions in all three formats of the game: the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (First Class), Pakistan Cup (List A) and National T20 Cup (Domestic T20). The PCB's rationale in reducing the number of teams in domestic cricket was to concentrate talent in order to increase competition and improve the quality of cricket. The new structure also consisted of corresponding second XI, under-19, under-16 and under-13 competitions, and live television coverage of top level matches. The restructuring also reorganised district level cricket into a three tier bottom-up system, with 90 city cricket associations supervising school and club cricket at grassroots level, and inter-city tournaments providing a stepping-stone to the six elite regional teams.\nThe six regional teams (operated by respective six cricket associations) ensure that the affairs of the associations at city level are regulated. They frame policies that will develop cricket at the grassroots, manage club cricket in collaboration with the 90 city associations and also oversee intra-city competitions. The teams are responsible for revenue generation through sponsorship, marketing and strategic collaborations with business conglomerates. Each of the six regional teams have a chief executive officer and a management committee that has been tasked with supervising all cricketing activities. These changes have been made by the PCB in order to decentralise the administrative body so that it can limit itself to a supervisory role by delegating responsibilities related to the development of the sport to the provincial associations. This tiered structure has been enshrined in the PCB constitution.\nHeadquarters.\nThe PCB headquarters are located near the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore. All PCB Officials sit there during the weekdays from 9AM to 5PM.\nPCB annual awards.\nPakistan Cricket Board for the first time held inaugural awards in 2012 to recognize, acknowledge and honour Pakistan's prime cricketing talent that has consistently stood out on the field of play.\nPCB initiative to revive cricket in Pakistan.\nAustralian envoy visits PCB headquarters.\nThe Australian Higher Commissioner to Pakistan, Peter Heyward, visited the PCB headquarters at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on 3 September 2012. He appreciated the board's efforts to bring cricket back in Pakistan. He further said he always love to see the Australian team playing against Pakistan in front of Pakistani people and on their home grounds.\nAsian Cricket Council Development Committee.\nThe Asian Cricket Council Development Committee meeting was held in Islamabad on 24 September 2012 and was chaired by Zaka Ashraf. The Chairman PCB called on the members to come over to Pakistan to play cricket. ACC members assured the then Chairman of their support and Chief Executive of ACC Syed Ashraful Haq said they felt no security concern in Pakistan and considered playing cricket here to be safe as anywhere in the world.\nICC CEO visits NCA.\nDavid Richardson, the chief executive of the International Cricket Council, visited National Cricket Academy on 12 January 2013. He said that Pakistan Cricket Board is working very hard to bring International Cricket back to Pakistan and it is our role to support Pakistan Cricket Board in its efforts to revive international cricket whenever it is possible."

        "text": "The Canberra Golf Club, later known as the Royal Canberra Golf Club, was formed in 1926. Its original grounds were behind the Hotel Canberra on the river flats on both sides of the Molonglo River.\nHistory.\nThe club's Club House was on a site near the Albert Hall and included the old brick fireplace and chimney of the nearby Kaye family's slab cottage. The Kaye family took over the lease of Klensendorlffe's stone villa in 1854 and in the early 1890s constructed a new slab home with the brick fireplace and chimney mentioned above. The site of this building, like the greens, is below the waters of Lake Burley Griffin.\nShortly before work commenced on the lake (early 1960s) the Royal Canberra Golf Club moved to its present site in Yarralumla.\nThe history of Royal Canberra Golf Club, or its predecessors, is almost as long as the history of the national capital itself.\nThe foundation stone for the city was laid in 1913 and in that same year, a few golfing enthusiasts established a nine-hole course on a site near to, what is now the city centre. Subsequently, in 1922, those stalwarts domiciled themselves on a new nine hole, sand green layout at Acton, sharing space with the Acton racecourse and leading to problem lies through omni-present hoof marks on the fairways. In 1926, the Federal Capital Commission constructed a new golf course on an adjacent site at Acton, where the Canberra Golf Club had its first real home. That Acton course was built on the banks of the Molonglo River and, with the river as a constant threat to wayward shots, soon earned a reputation as a superb and challenging test of golf. With minor changes only to the layout, but major changes to the clubhouse, it remained the home of Royal Canberra Golf Club until 1962, the \"Royal\" status having been granted by King George V in 1933.\nThe Walter Burley Griffin plan for Canberra called for the damming of the Molonglo River to form a lake and so it was that, in 1962, with its Acton site due to be submerged in that plan, the Club moved to its present site at Westbourne Woods. In the 40 years since that move the Royal Canberra Golf Club has developed into one of Australia's pre-eminent inland golf courses.\nCanberra native and future professional golfer David Galloway began his career at Royal Canberra. Galloway honed his skills at the club and won a number of junior championships there. As of early 1969 he was a club professional at Royal Canberra.\nRoyal Canberra hosted the 2013 ISPS Handa Women's Australian Open. The length of the course was increased from 5,891 metres to over 6,000 metres."

        "title": "Cricket in Scotland",
        "text": "Cricket has a considerably lower profile in Scotland than it has in neighbouring England. Scotland is not one of the twelve leading cricketing nations which play Test matches, but the Scottish national team is now allowed to play full One Day Internationals even outside the Cricket World Cup, in which Scotland competed in 1999, 2007, and 2015. Scotland has a well established recreational cricket structure. In 2016 it was estimated that around 17,000 people play cricket in Scotland. At international level, Scotland is ranked as one of the highest 'associate' (non Test) teams, and has historic rivalries both with its neighbouring full members England and Ireland, and fellow high ranked associate, Netherlands.\nHistory.\nCricket in Scotland is at least 225 years old. The first match for which records are available was played in September 1785 at Schaw Park, Alloa. The game was more generally introduced to Scotland by English soldiers garrisoned in the country in the years following the Jacobite rising led by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745; and it is no coincidence that the oldest known club is Kelso (records date back to 1820), in the Borders, then a garrison town. The origins of cricket in Perth, where cricket was also played at a very early stage, was also for the same reason.\nIn other areas, including the Borders of Scotland, the game seems to have been introduced by immigrant English workers in the paper, textile and iron industries, while in Edinburgh the game was taken up in the mid nineteenth century by the main Schools in the area, most prominently initially by the Royal High School &amp; Edinburgh Academy.\nThe first representative game of any standing was in 1849, when the All England XI came to Edinburgh to play a 22-man team representing Scotland. This match provoked great interest and similar visits followed over the next few years, representative games also being played in other Cities &amp; Towns. Scotland matches played on an eleven a side basis date from 1865, against a total of more than 30 countries, including all the Test-playing nations, and numerous other select teams, including, of course, the MCC. But the development of Scotland's international standing was more-or-less ignored for the best part of the 20th century, with three-day matches against Ireland, MCC, touring Test teams and the occasional County side being the only ones granted 'first-class' status.\nIn 1980, Scotland was invited to take part in England's Benson and Hedges Cup and NatWest Trophy one-day competitions. In a further development, Scotland resigned from membership of the UK Cricket Council in 1992, effectively severing links with England in the cricketing sense, and in 1994 was elected to Associate Membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC). This gave Scotland its own voice in world cricket and the national team took part for the first time in the ICC Trophy held in Kuala Lumpur in March/April 1997. Third place qualified Scotland for the ICC World Cup in 1999 hosted by England, and Scotland themselves hosted two games (against New Zealand &amp; Bangladesh) at The Grange Club in Edinburgh.\nAlthough failing to qualify for the 2003 World Cup, Scotland made significant inroads in professionalising the game in Scotland. The first part of this was Scotland's acceptance into the English Sunday League competition in 2003, for a period of three years. This involved playing a minimum of 18 matches of top class cricket against the English counties, giving both players and administrators the level of experience necessary for Scotland's progress to One-Day International status.\nIn a halcyon period for the Scotland International side, they won the inaugural (three-day) ICC Intercontinental Cup in November 2004, and then the 2005 ICC Trophy in Dublin by beating old rivals Ireland, putting the Scots into 12th place in the global rankings. This gave Scotland qualification for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Placed in the hardest Group, no successes were achieved in the Tournament and there was further disappointment at not achieving qualification for the 2011 World Cup.\nThe International teams then entered a transitional phase, with the retiral of several key players from the previous few years. It was 2011 before Scotland emerged with a fully competitive team, most notably winning four consecutive One Day Internationals against Afghanistan, Netherlands (twice) and Ireland. Following defeat by Sri Lanka, they continued a successful path by beating Northamptonshire and Warwickshire on consecutive days in the CB40 Competition.\nAdministration.\nThe governing body for Scottish cricket is Cricket Scotland, which administers women's cricket and junior cricket as well as the men's game.\nThe then Scottish Cricket Union resigned from the UK Cricket Council in 1992, effectively severing links with the organisation of cricket in England and Wales. In 1994 Scotland became an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council.\nMen's national team.\nThe Scottish men's team competed in the Cricket World Cup in 1999. It lost all five of its matches and was eliminated in the preliminary round. Scotland failed to qualify for the 2003 World Cup but qualified for the 2007 event in the West Indies. Scotland won the qualifying tournament, the ICC Trophy, in Ireland in 2005. Scotland played Australia, South Africa and the Netherlands in the opening group stage in 2007. Most of the members of Scotland's national team are amateurs, although a few Scots have played professionally in English domestic cricket, and for the England national team, including former captain Mike Denness.\nIn 2003, the Scottish team was granted a place in the English national one day cricket league in the hope that playing against professional cricketers on a regular basis would improve the performance level of the best Scottish cricketers.\nThe Scottish national team qualified for the 2007 2009, 2016, 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cup tournaments, qualifying for the main round for the first time at the 2021 Tournament.\nThey have also qualified for the upcoming edition of the T20 World Cup which will be hosted by West Indies and United States in June 2024.\nDomestic cricket.\nAmateur cricket leagues.\nScotland has amateur cricket leagues held throughout the country which are ran by five associations: \nIn addition to leagues ran by the 5 associations, there is also the Eastern Premier League, which is a combined top level 10 team league for sides from East of Scotland Cricket Association and the Strathmore &amp; Perthshire Cricket Union.\nThe Regional Series.\nThe Regional Pro Series was first launched in 2016 replacing the North Sea Pro Series a competition which was a joint venture between the Royal Dutch Cricket Board and Cricket Scotland. It is Scotland's premier domestic competition. The tournament consists of three teams; Western Warriors, Eastern Knights and Caledonian Highlanders. Each team is based in a different region of Scotland.\nTwenty20 cricket.\nThe first season of the European T20 league, a Twenty20 franchise-based tournament, was scheduled to start in August 2019.\nNotable Scottish cricketers.\nOne of the most notable cricketers in history was a Scot, born in India of Scottish parents, Douglas Jardine, the inventor of \"Leg Theory\". Jardine was born in British India, brought up in St Andrews, spent most of his life in England, died in Switzerland and his ashes were scattered in Perthshire. He gave his own children Scottish names.\nA number of other prominent cricketers have come from Scotland, including the former England captain,Mike Denness, Warwickshire all-rounder Dougie Brown, and former England test players Gavin Hamilton and Gregor MacGregor, who represented Scotland at rugby as well as England at cricket.\nAnother notable Scottish cricketer was Brian Hardie, who was a major contributor to the successful Essex side of the 70's and 80's. One of the most successful Scottish spinners, and a respected journalist, was Ian Peebles, who was one of the cricketers of the year in 1931 alongside Donald Bradman.\nR. C. Robertson-Glasgow played for Oxford University and Somerset and later became a prominent cricket writer and correspondent. The South African-born former England captain Tony Greig also qualified to play for England due to his Scottish parentage.\nFinally Scots have also played for other countries: Tom Campbell for South Africa and Archie Jackson for Australia."

        "title": "Thames sailing barge",
        "text": "A Thames sailing barge is a type of commercial sailing boat once common on the River Thames in London. The flat-bottomed barges, with a shallow draught and leeboards, were perfectly adapted to the Thames Estuary, with its shallow waters and narrow tributary rivers. The larger barges were seaworthy vessels, and were the largest sailing vessel to be handled by just two men. The average size was about 120 tons and they carried of canvas sail in six working sails. The mainsail was loose-footed and set up with a sprit, and was brailed to the mast when not needed. It is sheeted to a horse, as is the foresail; they require no attention when tacking. The foresail is often held back by the mate to help the vessel come about more swiftly.\nThe topsail was usually first sail on and last sail off, being fixed to the topmast by hoops. In the upper reaches of the rivers and constricted harbours it reached into the clear air, and when approaching a berth casting off the halliard would drop it immediately killing the forward drive. The mizzen boom in a mulie is sheeted down to the long shallow rudder. The masts are mounted in tabernacles so they can be lowered to pass under bridges; the anchor windlass is used to lower and raise the gear via triple blocks. This takes considerable effort and to aid in the process 'hufflers' were often used. They would come on board to help with lowering and raising the gear (for a fee). The bowsprit where fitted could be 'topped', helping where space was limited.\nThe river barges worked the London River and the Port of London. Cut barges were smaller so they could pass into the Regent's and Surrey canals. The larger estuary barges were seaworthy craft working the Kent and Essex coasts while coasters also traded much further afield, to the north of England, the South Coast, the Bristol Channel and to continental European ports. Cargoes varied enormously: bricks, cement, hay, rubbish, sand, coal, grain and gunpowder. Timber, bricks and hay were stacked on the deck, while cement and grain was carried loose in the hold. They could sail low in the water, even with their gunwales beneath the surface.\nThey sailed the Medway and Thames in a ponderous way for two hundred years; then in the 1860s a series of barge races were started, and the barges' design improved as vessels were built with better lines in order to win. The Thames barge races are the world's second oldest sailing competition, second to the America's Cup.\nBuild and rigging.\nThe vast majority of barges were wooden hulled (although a significant number of later barges were also built in steel), between long with a beam of around . The hull form was as distinctive as their rig, being flat-bottomed with no external keel. There is a degree of flare to the sides and plumb ends. The stern was a transom, shaped like a section through a champagne glass, on which was hung a large rudder. The hull was mainly a hold with two small living areas in the bow and stern, and access was through two large hatchways, the smaller before the main mast and a much larger aperture behind. To prevent her unwanted (sideways) passage to the lee, are two massive pivoted leeboards.\nThey were usually spritsail rigged on two masts. Most had a topsail above the huge mainsail and a large foresail. The mizzen was a much smaller mast on which was set a single sail whose main purpose was to aid steering when tacking. The rig also allowed a relatively large sail area on the upper part of the mast, to catch wind when moored ships, buildings or trees blocked wind on the water's surface. The topsail could remain set even when the mainsail had been brailed to the mast. Sail areas varied from depending on the size of the barge. The typical, rusty-red colour of the flax sails was due to the dressing used to treat the sails that were permanently aloft (traditionally made from red ochre, cod oil, urine and seawater). The red ochre was there to block the ultra-violet in the sunlight from degrading the sails (much as lamp-black was used in the sail dressing for the Norfolk wherries), but sails that were stowed away such as jibsails were usually left untreated. The barges required no ballast, and sailing in this condition with leeboards raised they typically draw only 3 foot; this has caught out a few modern yachtsmen who have run aground while attempting to follow them. No auxiliary power was used originally but many barges were fitted with engines in later years and most retain them, but among the surviving sailing barges both \"Mirosa\" and \"Edme\" have never had engines.\nThe mast was mounted in a mast case, or \"tabernacle\", at deck level and could be dropped and raised while under way, enabled the barge to \"shoot bridges\"-pass under bridges, on the Thames and Medway without losing headway. When no wharf was available, the barge could use the ebbing tide to stand on the mud, close to shore and offload its goods onto carts. A barge with no topsail – or top mast sailing \"stumpy-rigged\" required a smaller crew. With a shallow draught, they could penetrate deep into the back waters. Not needing ballast reduced their turn-round time. Where fitted, the bowsprit could also be \"topped up\" - raised, to allow it to use a shorter wharf.\nIn good conditions, sailing barges could attain speeds of over , and their leeboards allowed them to be highly effective windward performers. The unusual spritsail rig allowed any combination of sails to be set: often the topsail on its own would be effective.\nHistory.\nThe precursor to the square spritsail barge was the London lighter or dumb-barge. They flitted up and down the river delivering cargo, using the incoming tide to send them up river, and the ebbing tide for the return journey. They were manoeuvered by a pair of bargemen using long sweeps (oars). These barges had a flat box like bow (swim-headed) and a near flat stern, or a square sloping stern (budgett stern). There is a print in the Guildhall Library dating from 1764, showing a 1697 built, round bowed barge with a spritsail rig – but with no mizzen.\nThe spritsail and the leeboards are both of Dutch origin and can be traced back to 1416 and can be seen on the London River by 1600.\nMizzenless barges, known as luff barges, were smaller and more streamlined: they principally worked the upper reaches of the Thames. In a 1752 engraving of the Chelsea Waterworks there is a stumpie with a transom stern.\nIn the 1800s EW Cooke (1811–1880), made a series of engravings of barges on the river, leaving a record of most of the possible rigs.\nThe flat-bottomed hull made these craft extremely versatile and economical. They could float in as little as of water and could dry out in the tidal waters without heeling over. This allowed them to visit the narrow tributaries and creeks of the Thames to load farm cargoes, or to dry out on the sand banks and mudflats to load materials for building and brickmaking (it was no coincidence that their use peaked while London was expanding rapidly). The main mast could be lowered to clear bridges. Furthermore, unlike most sailing craft, these barges could sail completely unballasted — a major saving in labour and time. The predominant rig was spritsail, though there were some that were sloop rigged with a gaff and an overhanging boom, and some that were ketch rigged. Mulies were rigged spritsail on the main and gaff rigged on the mizzen. The dandy rig had spritsail on the main and a lugsail on the mizzen.\nThe hull evolved: firstly decks were fitted around 1810, the round bow started to supersede the swim-head about 1840, and became a straight stem by 1900, the transom stern replaced the budget stern about 1860. \n1863, 1864 and 1865 saw the first Thames Barge Races. These continued unbroken until 1938. The aim of the founder William Henry Dodd, \"The Golden Dustman\", was to raise the status of the bargemen, and to improve the performance of the barges. There were two classes, one for stumpies (under 80 tons) and one for heavier (under 100 tons) topsail barges. These were fiercely competitive – and soon new barges were being built, using the improved techniques learnt, to win the next year's race. The Medway races started in 1880.\nTheir heyday came at the turn of the 20th century when over 2000 were on the registry. That century saw a steady decline in their numbers. The last wooden built barge SB \"Cabby\", was built by Gill, at the LRTC yard in Frindsbury in 1928. The last Thames barge to trade entirely under sail was the Everard-built in 1970, owned by the folk song collector Captain A. W. (Bob) Roberts. \n\"Cambria\"s last mate was Dick Durham from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, with whom Bob carried the last freight under sail alone: 100 tons of cattle cake from Tilbury Docks to Ipswich in October 1970. Dick wrote Bob Roberts's biography: \"The Last Sailorman\".\nFollowing the Second World War, the coastal barge trade diminished as the nation became more mechanised. Cargoes went by road instead of by sea, squeezing the purses of the barge owners, until most of the once-handsome barges were given motors and relegated to short, lightering passages within the Thames Estuary. \nTrade.\nMany cargos were brought by barge into London such as building material. Bricks came from Essex and Kent, cement from Kent and sand was dug by the bargees from the estuary sandbanks. When the barges reached London Bridge, the mast was lowered with the help of 'hufflers' (spare strong blokes), so they could pass under to wharfs in the Pool of London or further upstream to Westminster or beyond. At the wharf the load was removed by horse and cart – the cart could carry one and a half tons over the un-metalled roads. The barge could carry 80 to 150 tons, although 120 was the most common tonnage.\nHoy companies.\nThere was a well established trading network along both sides of the estuary before the Thames sailing barge became ubiquitous. Each port had a hoy company that would run weekly forays into London to deliver or collect goods. They got their names from the hoy, an open square-sail barge. Typically they would run into London laden on a Monday, discharge and return the Thursday with a new cargo to arrive home to spend the Sunday with their families. By the 1880s they were competing for trade with steam engines on the railways, but could offer rates four or five times cheaper. \nThe hay-up dung-down trade.\nAll transport in London was horse-drawn. The horses needed vast quantities of hay and straw, and they produced a vast quantity of dung.\nThe 'Stackie' was a special type of barge designed for the hay and dung trade. The hold would be loaded with fodder root crops and hay would be loaded on the deck, in an inwardly sloping stack eight bales high. This would be covered with a tarpaulin, secured with the hatch covers and roped down. The mainsail had to be smaller to clear this stack (this could be achieved by reefing), and the foresail would be sheeted to a temporary wire horse. Often the stack would also overlap the sides of the vessel, and in all cases it obscured the view from the helm requiring excellent communication between master and mate sailing such an awkward load in a crowded river. On the return run from London, the hold would be filled with dung, useful for farmers but a nuisance in London.\nMirosa was once a stackie barge, built in 1892, extensively raced and chartered since c1970 she is one of the few remaining Thames sailing barges that has never had an engine fitted. built at Cooks Yard in 1897 was also a stackie. She has been restored and in 2017 is sailing again. Stackies have been popular with model-makers, and two are regularly displayed at the Thames sailing barge pop-up museum. They are \"Venta\" and \"British King\".\nCut barges.\nThe smallest river barges were designed to trade up the Regent's and Surrey canals as well. They had a capacity of 70-80 tons, and a beam of only . They were stumpies with a high peaked mainsail. They had little sheer as they had to pass under very low bridges. They stowed their leeboard and lowered their gear flat on deck, so their highest point would be the wheel from which spokes would be removed to gain a few extra inches. When light, the barge would be partially flooded to gain headroom for a bridge or tunnel.\nCement barges.\nThese were the Kentish Barges from along the Medway. Chalk was quarried between Aylesford and Strood, and the barges shot Rochester Bridge and took the chalk to the many cement works in the region, and then took the cement to London. There was brick and cement activity along the Swale. At Teynham Charles Richardson produced stock bricks that were used in the viaduct that took the railway from Greenwich to London. Cement from his kilns in Conyer was exported from London to New Zealand. These barges were recognised by the covering of ash and cement dust, caused from lying to the lee of cement works. Additionally the Kentish creeks such as Conyer and Milton contained discolouring mud that would foul clean paintwork.\nKentish barges had less need of bowsprits, that the Essex barges found beneficial doing the long run along the Swin (Thames).\nGrain barges.\nThe main trade was trans-shipping grain unloaded from large vessels from the colonies, and taking it from the London ports out to the mills or maltings at the head of the many tidal creeks on the East coast and around the Thames estuary, though also grain was transhipped into London mills further upstream such as the City Flour Mills at Puddle Dock reputed to be the largest in the world when built in the early 1850s. Grain could be carried loose in the hold or bagged. Those delivering grain out of London would then seek a suitable cargo back into London to avoid returning light. A particularly well recorded example of a grain barge is the , which was a 59-ton barge built by Glover at Gravesend, Kent in 1901, and registered in Rochester. Her official number was 113,708. She was built for capacity rather than speed.; long and had a beam of . Light, she drew of water, and laden .\nBrick barges.\nBricks were made using the heavy Essex clay, or clay deposits from along the Swale which was mixed with local chalk and breeze (town ash). The breeze was the ash screened from London rubbish. This was transported by barge, to Teynham, Lower Halstow and Conyer and the finished Kentish yellow bricks went back to London. A sizeable barge building industry was created in Sittingbourne. These 100 ton capacity barges stowed 40,000 to 42,000 bricks and were box-like in section.\nCoastal barges.\nPortland stone was brought from the quarries at Weymouth round the North Foreland, into the Thames estuary and up into the London River.\nNorth Sea barges.\nThe North Sea was important. Coals were brought from Newcastle, to the shallow estuary ports along the London River. These essentially were schooner rigged with the flat barge hull. After the second world war, coal was still delivered to the gasworks at Margate by from Goole. During the first world war, they carried coal between Goole and Calais; this was four days work- 200 tons at £6.00 a ton. The barges general were too shallow to activate the mines. \nCoastal barges made long passages, built in 1858 used to trade regularly between Liverpool and Rotterdam.\nThe matches.\nThe barges' performance was perfected through the annual sailing matches, in which they competed for trophies and cash prizes. The matches are credited with encouraging improvements in design, leading to the craft's highly efficient final form. They were begun in 1863 by a wealthy owner called Henry Dodd. Dodd was a plough boy from Hackney, London, who made his fortune carrying the city's waste to the country on the barges. He may well have been the model for Charles Dickens's character the Golden Dustman in \"Our Mutual Friend\". On his death in 1881, Dodd left £5000 for future match prizes.\nThe Thames and Medway barge matches were temporarily discontinued in 1963. In the matches that year, \"Spinaway C\" (skippered by George Morgan) won the Thames race and came second in the Medway. \"Memory\" came second in the Thames (skippered by Hedley Farrington) and first in the Medway (skippered by \"Dick\" Springett). These two were the very last of the restricted staysail barges to win the old classic races.\nThe matches have ceased and been reinstituted several times, and are now considered the world's second-oldest sailing race (after the America's Cup). The course was originally from Erith upriver, but as of the early 20th century the start was moved to the Lower Hope downriver from Gravesend into the Estuary and back to Gravesend.\n2013 was the 150th anniversary of the Thames Match – and to celebrate the finish line was at Erith. There was a full programme of races in 2017 on the Medway and Thames.\nThe 109th Medway barge race took place on Saturday 3 June 2017. The course was from Gillingham Pier, following the channel to the Medway buoy east of the Nore in the Thames and back to Gillingham. The 110th was scheduled for 19 May 2018.\nOperation Dynamo – the Dunkirk evacuation.\nThirty barges were part of the fleet of 'Little Ships' that rescued soldiers of the retreating British Expeditionary Force from the beaches of Dunkerque. The flat-bottomed barges could reach the beaches, and take off the troops, ferrying them to the larger vessels waiting off shore. These would make the Channel crossing. Twelve barges were sunk, but eighteen vessels returned: one of these, , was harmed by a mine but has been fixed up and is still used on the rivers today; another, \"Ena\", had her crew taken off and was to be abandoned in France but was floated and sailed home by a group of soldiers with only holiday sailing experience. The oldest Little Ship still active is the barge \"Greta\" (built in 1892).\nConstruction.\nThames barges were built for strength. They had flat bottoms to allow them to be easily beached or lie on the river mud, and were rigged to allow them to be operated by two men and possibly a lad. They were built in bargeyards adjacent to a river or creek on bargeblocks- a series of trestles raised about a metre from the compacted ground, that allowed working access above and below. The smallest barges were the river barges of 100 ton capacity, the estuary barges were generally heavier 120 -140 tons and the coasters reaching 160-180 tons. At 280 ton, the four \"Everards\" barges built in Great Yarmouth and the R &amp; W Pauls, Brightlingsea built barges \"Barbara Jean\" and \"Aidie\" were the largest.\nBarges were built exclusively of wood until 1900, when the first steel barges appeared. During its active life it could be doubled or boxed- that is a second shell of planking would be fixed over the first.\n\"Kathleen\" was a typical grain barge built at Gravesend in 1901. She became notable by featuring in two reference books, where her measurements were published in great detail. Over time her rig was changed to suit commercial conditions.\nThe keel was a piece of elm. It was broader than it was deep and long. At the bow the stempost was raised vertically and at the stern the sternpost, these were made from lengths of English oak. The apron and the inner sternpost were strengthening timbers. The fore and aft deadwood would raise the floors to give shape at the bow and the sweep to the fashion timbers of the transom. Across the keel and deadwood were laid the floors, these were oak timbers at centres. The length of each floor would be taken of a half hull model, most would be long, the same length as her beam. On top of the floors, on top of the keel, on earlier barges was bolted a massive Oregon pine keelson. This used iron bolts. On \"Kathleen\" the keelson was a made of a steel section, in profile similar to railway line (): it was cheaper but could distort. The keelson would be scarfed into the apron and deadwood and would be shorter than the keel. There were equivalent stemsons and sternsons.\nThe futtocks (side-frames) were dovetailed onto the end of each floor and every other joint was strengthened with an iron angle plate. The futtocks were of oak and of varying length averaging . Temporary cross-poles were used to hold the ends of the futtocks in place. The barge was now in frame, and the shipwright approved the lines. Ribbands were temporarily nailed to the outside of the frames to hold this position. The inner angle between the floor and the futtocks were stiffened by inner chines or chine keelsons, made of a single piece of pitch pine This was bolted to each floor and futtock. Above it was a oak stringer that was bolted to the futtocks and led out to stem and stern post.\nCeilings and linings.\nThe ceilings were now laid on the floors. These would be pine planks thick, and as wide as available. The height of the deck was marked on the frames – forming a beam-line, and a beam thickness beneath it, a oak inwale was bolted to the futtocks. The inside of the hold was lined with thick pine. The inwale formed a ledge on which the curved beams of the deck, and the carlings rested. The two large holds made it impossible to use deckbeams alone. There were 3 beams afore the forehold, three beams under the mast-case between the holds, 2 between the mainhold and the companionway to the cabin, two supporting the transom. On the Kathleen, the port and starboard decks were of differing widths.\nLeeboards and rudder.\nThe leeboards are a distinguishing feature of wherries and Thames barges. They are needed to prevent lateral movement in the absence of a keel. On the Kathleen they were made of thick oak and strapped with seven iron straps. They weighed around were long and had a fan, They were pivoted from the gunwale, and dropped below the hull. They were raised by means of two crab winches. Partially raised leeboards could be used as a means of steering, and in shallow waters, the barge could be pivoted on a leeboard that was being dragged in the mud.\nThe rudder was attached to a square oak rudderpost. The blade of the rudder was wide made up of boards tapering from to . On older smaller vessels, there was a long tiller. On a few vessels, ropes/chains and pulleys were attached to the rudder post and these lines passed round a drum with a conventional ships wheel- on the vast majority of barges, the rudder was attached to the wheel by an intentionally loose fitting worm screw gear. Some barges had an all metal ships wheel: this was known as the chaff cutter after the similar-looking agricultural tool.\nThe rig.\nWhen she was built, \"Kathleen\" had a bowsprit, main mast and a mizzen mast. She was rigged with spritsails on both masts and a topsail on the main. She was rerigged in 1926 without a bowsprit. In 1946 she lost her mizzen when an engine was added. In 1954 her rig was reduced to that of a motor barge, and from 1961 to 1965 she was used as a lighter, with engine and mast stripped away. When she was converted to a barge yacht for the 1966, 1967 sailing races, her rig was similar to that in 1926. \nThis was the classic spreetie rig. Early spritsail barges were rigged without a top mast: these were called stumpies, and they sailed as a separate class in the Thames barge race until 1890 which was won by \"Early Bird\". \nThe loose footed spritsail was suited to river work. The rig has the advantage of allowing a high stack of deck cargo. The entire sail can be quickly brailed to the mast, allowing unimpeded access to the deck and hold when loading and unloading. Barges are unballasted and, if overpressed, will heel excessively and must be pulled to wind. As the sheet is eased, the aft end of a boom would drag in the water, making the rudder ineffective and a capsize inevitable. In contrast, the sheet of loose-footed mainsail is just released and control is immediately regained.\nAs there is no boom to project outboard. the vessel can pass through a narrow gap between moored vessels. Loose-footed sails do suffer from sail twist, which reduces their aerodynamic efficiency when sailing off the wind, which usually is not a commercial issue. Vangs control the head of the mainsail and act a sheets for the topsail, which can be set so as to make use of the air above the wind-shadow of moored ships, warehouses and local features.\n Sail could be shortened rapidly by the two-man crew in the most difficult seas. The topsail was on hoops, so the halyard was let go and the sail \"rucked\" (dropped) to the hounds. The mainsail was pulled tightly to the mast by brails. The vangs were slackened, the sheet released and the sail \"brailed up\" by the mate using the brailing winch. The mate let go the foresail halyards and it dropped to the deck. If she was beaching, the crab winches were manned and the leeboards hoisted to stop them bumping. The anchor was let go. She could be unloaded onto the sand when the tide had dropped. The sails were secured and the spreet was fixed and warps and fenders made fast.\nIn narrow channels, and in the lee of tall buildings the mainsail and mizzen are brailed and the bowsprit topped up, and she sails on topsail and foresail alone. A gaff rig was more suitable for heavy weather and long sea passages, but when a gaff rigged boomie takes in the mainsail, she cannot set the topsail.\nA boomie is a flat-bottomed ketch-barge, ketch rigged on the main and the mizzen; the sprit was replaced by a gaff, and the foot was tied to a boom. These were big barges that were built to finer lines often with a false clipper cutwater, and a rounded counter-stern. It had a standing bowsprit, and the mast was stepped on the keelson. It took four or five men to sail, took more space on the wharf and could not operate on its topsail alone, so it was more suited to longer sea journeys; the centre of gravity of the stowed sails was lower and the crew accommodation more comfortable. When times got hard, some of these barges would be re-rigged with a sprit on the main but leaving the gaff on the mizzen, becoming a mulie. The biggest barge ever launched in Kent, \"Eliza Smeed\" (1867) was rigged as a barquentine fitted with leeboards.\nThe Thames and Medway sailing match community divides the barges into two classes: the staysail barges whose foresails are attached to the mainstay, and those having a bowsprit, known as bowsprit barges. The Medway and London river barges generally are staysail barges and the estuary barges that do the longer open water runs up the \"Swin\" and the \"Wallet\" channels tend to be the larger bowsprit barges. Barges can change rig and class, as the Kathleen did. For racing purposes, extra sail can be carried: additional staysails and spinnakers.\nSpars.\nThe mainmast was made of spruce, it was to the head, and it was to the hounds. The sprit was . The topmast was to the hounds, it had a pole, and a headstick.\nThe mizzen mast was to the head. The sprit was , and the boom was .\nThe bowsprit was with outboard.\nStanding rigging.\nThe original barges were rigged with hemp, where most barges in use today use wire ropes. The standing rigging had to hold the masts, and sprit in place. As the masts were lowered and raised to clear bridges the forestay was connected to the windlass. The topmast could be lowered. The lower end of the sprit was held to the mast in a 'muzzle', but held aloft by the 'stanliff' or 'standlift' chain.\nShe was rigged with shrouds. \nSails.\nThe mainsail was (weather), by (head) with a leech of and a foot of , giving a sail area of .\nThe topsail was (weather), with a leech of and a foot of , giving a sail area of .\nThe foresail was (weather), with a leech of and a foot of , giving a sail area of .

The sailcloth is of flax, and to be kept in a supple and waterproof condition it must be dressed. Importantly, the flax must not dry out or will chafe against the rigging or against the brails when not in use.\nPreservation.\nInspired by a mention of the Norfolk Wherry Trust in Hervey Benham's book \"Down Tops'l\", the Thames Sailing Barge Trust was founded on 15 April 1952 in the cabin of the sailing barge \"George Smeed\", anchored at Blacktail Spit in the Thames estuary. The committee members were Jim Lawrence (chairman), Colin Leggett (treasurer), John Kemp (organizing secretary), and Tom Hawkins. In 1955, the trust bought the sailing barge \"Memory\", which it operated as a cargo vessel until 1960 when the trust was dissolved. The Thames Sailing Barge Trust referred to here was not the same body as the current organisation\nwith the same name.\n\"Memory\" was bought from the trust by Sailtrust Limited, a partnership between John Kemp and Brian Beer. Following a suggestion by Hervey Benham, she was converted for use as an adventure training ship. However, the company was unable to make sufficient money from adventure training and they operated \"Memory\" as a weekend charter vessel with John Kemp as the skipper. \"Memory\" was the first sailing barge to engage in charter work.\nIn April 1965, Sailtrust Ltd were contracted to the London Borough of Redbridge to take parties of school children sailing, each week from April to October. This contract lasted for eleven years. During the second year of this contract, the Board of Trade tightened up the regulations for charter vessels and \"Memory\" could no longer be used for that purpose. She was replaced by the auxiliary sailing barge , previously owned by R &amp; W Paul and operated as a cargo ship until 1966. Both barges were skippered by John Kemp, with Jane Benham as mate. Operation of \"Thalatta\" was then taken over by the East Coast Sail Trust. She was then re-rigged by the Trust, using some items from the damaged barge \"Memory\". In 2005, the Trust had to repair the hull, using Heritage funding they completed the repairs in 2009. Then in August 2011, they re-launched the barge.\nReferences.\nFurther reading"

        "title": "Scorer (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a scorer is someone appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, the number of overs bowled. In professional games, in compliance with Law 3 of the \"Laws of Cricket\", two scorers are appointed, most often one provided by each team.\nThe scorers have no say in whether runs are scored, wickets taken or overs bowled. This is the job of the umpires on the field of play, who signal to the scorers in cases of ambiguity such as when runs are to be given as extras rather than credited to the batsmen, or when the batsman is to be awarded a boundary 4 or 6. So that the umpire knows that they have seen each signal, the scorers are required to immediately acknowledge it.\nWhile it is possible to keep score using a pencil and plain paper, scorers often use pre-printed scoring books, and these are commercially available in many different styles. Simple score books allow the recording of each batsman's runs, their scores and mode of dismissal, the bowlers' analyses, the team score and the score at the fall of each wicket. More sophisticated score books allow for the recording of more detail, and other statistics such as the number of balls faced by each batsman. Scorers also sometimes produce their own scoring sheets to suit their techniques, and some use coloured pens to highlight events such as wickets, or differentiate the actions of different batsmen or bowlers. It is often possible to tell from a modern scorecard the time at which everything occurred, who bowled each delivery, which batsman faced it, whether the batsman left the ball or played and missed, or which direction the batsman hit the ball and whether runs were scored. Sometimes details of occurrences between deliveries, or incidental details like the weather, are recorded.\nIn early times runs scored were sometimes simply recorded by carving notches on a stickthis root of the use of the slang term \"notches\" for \"runs\". In contrast, scoring in the modern game has become a specialism, particularly for international and national cricket competitions. While the scorers' role is clearly defined under the \"Laws of Cricket\" to be merely the recording of runs, wickets and overs, and the constant checking of the accuracy of their records with each other and with the umpires, in practice a modern scorer's role is complicated by other requirements. For instance, cricket authorities often require information about matters such as the rate at which teams bowled their overs. The media also ask to be notified of records, statistics and averages. For many important matches, unofficial scorers keep tally for the broadcast commentators and newspaper journalists allowing the official scorers to concentrate undisturbed. In the English county game, the scorers also keep score on a computer that updates a central server, to meet the demands of the online press that scores should be as up-to-date as possible.\nThe official scorers occasionally make mistakes, but unlike umpires' mistakes these may be corrected after the event.\nSome cricket statisticians who keep score unofficially for the printed and broadcast media have become quite famous, for instance Bill Frindall, who scored for the BBC radio commentary team from 1966 to 2008, and Jo King.\nThe ECB's Association of Cricket Officials provides training for scorers.\nMethods of scoring.\nThere are predominantly two methods that scorers use to record a game: manually and computerised.\nThe manual method uses a scorecard and a pen. The scorecard is colloquially known as The Book. Using the book, the scorer fills out two main sections per ball, the bowling analysis and the batting analysis. Each section helps track the number of balls bowled in an over, any extras (such as Wide Balls and No Balls) and also any wickets (or dismissals). At the end of each over, the scorer may fill in an over analysis with the score at the end of the over, the number of wickets that have fallen, any penalties incurred and the number of the bowler in the analysis.\nMost software used for cricket scoring uses a form at the front end with buttons for the scorer to press to record ball by ball events. Additional functions include being able to draw a line denoting where the ball went from the batting crease and where the ball pitched. This gives additional charts tracking bowling placement and shot selection which can then be used at the coaching level. This additional information, however, does not form part of the critical role of a scorer, which is to keep track of the score of the game. It has been known for scorers to use both methods in conjunction with one another, in case the computer goes down or runs out of battery.\nIn addition to PC software, mobile apps are being used. Most of the amateur tournaments use mobile apps on their smartphones because they are more convenient and free, which makes it perfect fit for amateur cricketers since they cannot afford to spend money on standalone and custom software. Mobile apps allow amateur cricketers to keep their scores online, and also provide them with personalised statistics and graphs on their own mobile devices.\nThe ECB make free software available for cricket scoring both on PC and mobile devices from the PlayCricket website.\nDetailed scoring.\nCricket scorers keep track of many other facts of the game. As a minimum a scorer would note:\nTraditionally, the score book might record each ball bowled by a bowler and each ball faced by a batsman, but not necessarily which batsman faced which ball. Linear scoring systems were developed from the late 19th century and early 20th century by John Atkinson Pendlington, Bill Ferguson and Bill Frindall, to keep track of the balls faced by a batsman off each bowler. Another early method of recording the number of balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler was devised by Australian scorer J.G. Jackschon in the 1890s, using a separate memorandum alongside the main scoresheet.\nFrequently more detail is recorded, for instance, for a batsman, the number of balls faced and the number of minutes batted. Sometimes charts (known as wagon wheels) are prepared showing to which part of the field each scoring shot by a batsman was made (revealing the batman's favourite places to hit the ball)\nTechnology such as Hawk-Eye allows for more detailed analysis of a bowler's performance. For instance the beehive chart shows where a bowler's balls arrived at a batsman (high, low, wide, on the off stump etc.), while the pitch map shows where the balls pitched (trending toward short, good, or full lengths). Both charts can also show the results of these balls (dots, runs, boundaries, or wickets)\nScoring notation.\nA cricket scorer will typically mark the score sheet with a dot for a legal delivery with no wicket taken or runs scored (hence the term \"a dot ball\") where conventional runs are taken the score sheet is marked with the number of runs taken on that delivery.\nSpecial notation is used in the case of extras.\nWides.\nThe conventional scoring notation for a wide is an equal cross (likened to the umpire standing with arms outstretched signalling a wide).\nIf the batsmen run byes on a wide ball or the ball runs to the boundary for 4, a dot is added in each corner for each bye that is run, typically top left, then top right, then bottom left and finally all 4 corners.\nIf the batsman hits the stumps with his bat, or the wicket-keeper stumps him, the batsman would be out and a ‘W’ is added to the WIDE ‘cross’ symbol.\nIf a batsman is run out while taking byes on a wide delivery then the number of completed runs are shown as dots and an 'R' is added in the corner for the incomplete run.\nNo-balls.\nThe conventional notation for a no-ball is a circle. If the batsman hits the ball and takes runs, then the runs are marked inside the circle. In practice it is easier to write down the number then encircle it. \nIf a no-ball delivery eludes the wicket keeper and the batsmen run byes or the ball runs to the boundary for 4 byes, each bye taken is marked with a dot inside the circle. Again it is easier to encircle the dots. These additional runs are debited as no-balls against the bowler, not 'fielding' extras (fielding extras being byes or leg byes).\nByes.\nThe conventional notation for a single bye is a triangle with a horizontal edge at the base and a point at the top. \nIf more than one bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\nLeg byes.\nThe conventional notation for a single leg bye is a triangle with a point at the base and horizontal edge at the top (an inverted bye symbol). If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\nMatch scores.\nOther than the information kept on a detailed scorecard, there are specific conventions for how the in-progress and overall result of a match is summarised and stated.\nWhile an innings is in progress, the innings score comprises the number of runs scored by the batting team and the number of wickets taken by the bowling team. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets is said to have a score of \"one hundred for three\", which is written \"100–3\" or \"100/3\". The exception is in Australia, where the order of the two numbers is switched: a spoken score of \"\"three for one hundred\" and written score of \"3–100\" or \"3/100\". Runs decide the winning and losing teams (or a draw) whereas wickets can only, if all wickets are taken, decide the match is over.\nWhen an innings is complete:\nIn a completed two-innings match, each team's innings scores are always written and spoken separately – the sum of the two innings scores is never written or spoken, despite the fact that it is the determining factor in who wins the match. If the match has a winner, then the winning team's score is listed first; if not, then the team which batted first is listed first. If a team has followed on in its second innings, this is indicated by appending \"(f/o)\" to its score. In this way, a finished cricket score gives enough information to describe each innings and the sequence in which they were played. The score is then usually accompanied by a statement of the result and (if applicable) margin of victory. The margin of victory can be described in four ways:\nSome examples of full statements of scores in two-innings matches include:\nThe statement of score and results is similar in a limited overs match, except that for a victory by \"wickets\", it is also conventional to append the number of balls remaining in the team's innings – since the number of overs is often a greater constraint than remaining wickets. If the overs or targets are amended by a rain rule (typically the Duckworth-Lewis method), this is always noted in the statement of result – which is important since the official margin of a victory by \"runs\" under a rain rule may not equal the difference between the teams' actual scores. As for a two-innings match, if a tied match is decided by a tie-breaker, the score will still reflect the primary result as a tie and the tie-breaker as an appendix to the result; this is even in the case of a Super Over, the runs from which are not added to the main innings score. Examples of full statements of results from limited overs matches include:\nIn the statement of results for a match without a winner, there are four distinct terms which may be used: \"draw\", \"tie\", \"no result\" and \"abandoned\". A \"tie\" is a match in which the game is completed and the two teams finish with the same number of runs. A \"draw\" is a two-innings match which does not reach a conclusion within its allotted time. \"No result\" is the outcome of a limited overs match which does not reach a conclusion, usually because rain prevents both teams from facing the prescribed minimum number of overs. An \"abandoned\" match is in which a ball is never bowled."

        "title": "Jack Lambert (American football)",
        "text": " \nJohn Harold Lambert (born July 8, 1952) is an American former football linebacker who played his entire 11-year career for Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). Recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990 as \"the greatest linebacker of his era,\" Lambert was the starting middle linebacker on four Super Bowl-winning teams with the Steelers. He played college football for the Kent State Golden Flashes.\nEarly years through college.\nLambert was born in Mantua, Ohio. He played football at Kent State University, winning two All-Mid-American Conference linebacker honors. Don James was his head coach. Alabama football coach Nick Saban and former Missouri football coach Gary Pinkel were his teammates. During his college career, he was originally going to study to become a veterinarian.\nProfessional career.\nLambert was selected by the Steelers in the second round of the 1974 NFL draft, though many pro football coaches and scouts thought he was too small to play linebacker in the NFL. (Lambert played quarterback at Crestwood HS before switching to defensive end at Kent State.) While most of his pro career he was reported to be and in the program, he measured and as a rookie.\nLambert was the prototypical middle linebacker for what became the Tampa Two defense. Bud Carson, in his \"Double-Rotating Zone\" defense where safeties played back in a two-deep zone and the corner-backs played in two shallow zones or in bump-and-run coverage, instead of having the middle linebacker close to the line in run support, had the middle linebacker drop back into a middle zone to cover the seam between the safeties. Middle linebackers had not been tasked in such a way previously (Dick Butkus and Ray Nitschke being the epitomes of the run-support middle linebacker), but Lambert's size, speed, and talents facilitated the new role.\nThe Steelers took a chance on Lambert when he replaced injured middle linebacker Henry Davis. Lambert went on to earn the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award as a central figure on a great Steeler defense that went on to win their first Super Bowl by beating the Minnesota Vikings 16–6 in Super Bowl IX.\nLambert prided himself on his ability to hit hard and intimidate the opposition. He was the Steelers starting middle linebacker for eight seasons when the team primarily used the 4–3 defense &amp; right inside linebacker for three seasons after the Steelers switched to the 3–4 defense, with Loren Toews being the regular starter at the other inside linebacker position late in Lambert's career though Lambert retained the \"Mike\" role as the team's signal-caller on defense. According to Steelers media guides, Lambert averaged 146 tackles per season through his 10th year. He recorded only 19 in his 11th and final season because of an injury.\nLambert amassed 28 career interceptions, 1,479 career tackles (1,045 solo), and (officially) 23 sacks. In a nine-year span, Jack Lambert was named to nine straight Pro Bowls and was NFL Defensive Player of the Year once.\nLambert's four upper front teeth were missing as a result of taking an elbow in basketball during high school. Although he had a removable partial denture he wore in public, he didn't wear it during games, and pictures of Lambert's toothless snarl became an iconic image of the famous Steeler defense.\nIn 1976, Lambert assumed the role as leader of the Steelers after star defensive tackle \"Mean Joe\" Greene missed several games due to a chronic back injury. After quarterback Terry Bradshaw, receiver Lynn Swann and several other starters went down with injuries, the Steelers struggled to a 1–4 record. At a \"players only\" meeting, Lambert made it clear that \"the only way we are going to the playoffs to defend our title is to win them all from here out.\" In a remarkable nine-game span, the Steelers defense allowed only two touchdowns and a total of 28 points, including five shutouts. The Steelers won all of these games and finished at 10–4. The defense gave up only a record low 138 points for the entire season. Eight of the eleven defensive starters on the Steelers made the Pro Bowl that year. Jack Lambert was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1976.\nDuring the 1984 season, a severe and recurring case of turf toe sidelined him, after which he retired. \nPersonal life.\nLambert is very private. He can rarely be seen in memorabilia signings in Pittsburgh.\nBroadcasting career.\nLambert was a member of the NFL on Westwood One as an analyst.\nHonors.\nIn 2004, the Fox Sports Net series \"The Sports List\" named Lambert as the toughest football player of all time.\nSince 1991, the Jack Lambert Trophy is an annual award given by the Touchdown Club of Columbus to the top American collegiate linebacker.\nLambert's number, 58, is one of many jersey numbers \"unofficially retired\" by the team. The Steelers have only retired three jersey numbers: 70, 75 and 32, worn by Ernie Stautner, Joe Greene and Franco Harris respectively.). Lambert's jersey number has perhaps gotten the most attention out of all jersey numbers not officially retired. When Lambert retired, he reportedly told the equipment manager that he was not to issue number 58 again. Lambert later fought with the equipment manager outside of the facility because of a misunderstanding about his number.\nLambert was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. Lambert was voted to the Pittsburgh Steelers 75th Anniversary team. NFL Network's countdown show, NFL Top 10, named Lambert the number 8 \"Most Feared Tackler\" and the number 5 \"Pittsburgh Steeler\" of all time.\nLambert remains popular among Steeler fans and was arguably the most feared defender on the team despite the fact that some have regarded Jack Ham as a better outside linebacker than Lambert as a middle linebacker during the Steelers dominance of the 1970s. This has been attributed to Lambert looking directly at the quarterback and vice versa before the start of plays. Adding to his mystique has been Lambert's reclusiveness in retirement; aside from his Hall of Fame induction and the Steelers last game at Three Rivers Stadium, Lambert has rarely made any public appearances related to football, preferring to live a private life."

        "title": "Eddie Jones (rugby union)",
        "text": "Edward Jones (born 30 January 1960) is an Australian rugby union coach and former player. He most recently coached the Australia national team from January until October 2023. He previously coached Australia, Japan and England. He returned to the role of Japan head coach in January 2024.\nHe coached Australia between 2001 and 2005, taking the team to the 2003 Rugby World Cup final. He was an advisor with South Africa when the Springboks won the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and from 2012 to 2015 he coached Japan, leading them in the 2015 Rugby World Cup and an upset win over South Africa. In November 2015, Jones was appointed head coach of England and led them to win the 2016 and 2017 Six Nations Championships, becoming only the second national team to be unbeaten in a calendar year. He led England to the 2019 Rugby World Cup final when they were beaten by South Africa.\nJones played as a hooker for Sydney club Randwick and New South Wales and began coaching Randwick in 1994. He continued his career in Japan between 1995 and 1997 for Tokai University, as an assistant to the Japan national team and for Suntory Sungoliath. In 1998 he returned to Australia, taking charge of ACT Brumbies in Super Rugby and also coached the Queensland Reds in the 2007 Super Rugby season. In 2008, he had a brief spell at Saracens in England's Premiership, before returning to Suntory Sungoliath for a second spell which culminated in winning the 2011–12 Top League championship.\nEarly and personal life.\nJones was born in 1960 in the Tasmanian town of Burnie, Australia to a Japanese mother and an Australian father. He is married to Hiroko Jones, a Japanese woman whom he met while teaching at the International Grammar School in Sydney. They have a daughter, Chelsea Jones. Jones is a supporter of English football team West Ham United, and Australian rugby league team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League (NRL).\nJones, was raised in Sydney, New South Wales, during which time his father served in the Vietnam War. He attended La Perouse Public School in the city's South-East, alongside Mark, Glen and Gary Ella.\nPlaying career.\nJones started his playing career at Matraville Sports High School. He played as a hooker for Randwick between 1981 and 1991 and New South Wales. Jones played against the British Lions for New South Wales B in 1989. He also made three appearances for Leicester during the 1991/92 season in England. He retired to concentrate on a career as a teacher and school principal.\nHe is described in the Randwick Hall of Fame as follows: \"A light-weight and mobile hooker who played 210 club games from 1981 to 1991, scoring 14 tries [56pts]. His first grade games numbered 147 and in them he scored 10 tries [40pts]. A tigerish forward, who played well above his weight, he supplemented good tight forward play by operating as a third flanker. He played in six first grade grand finals [1984 to 1989] of which Randwick lost only two [1985 and 1986]. He also played in two reserve grade finals [1983 and 1991]. captaining the side which won in 1991, which was his last game for Randwick. He was the club's best and fairest player in 1982, was awarded the Ron Don trophy for the most improved club player in 1982 and 1985 and the Wally Meagher trophy for the best clubman in 1990.\"\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nIn 1994 Jones gave up his career as a teacher and school principal to coach his former club Randwick. He then went to Japan, where he had brief stints coaching Tokai University, Japan (as assistant coach) and Suntory Sungoliath.\nACT Brumbies (1998–2001).\nJones returned to Australia in 1998 to coach the ACT Brumbies. However, he had a disappointing first season in charge, with the club finishing only 10th in the Super 12; he has since said he was \"way out of his depth\".\nJones went on to lead the Brumbies into the best period of their history. In 2000 they were runners-up, losing the final to the Crusaders, but in 2001 he coached them to their first title, the first team from outside New Zealand to win the tournament. Notably, while with the Brumbies, it was Jones who was credited with discovering George Smith while at a trial for a rugby league team, the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles.\nAustralia (2001–2005).\nIn 2001 Jones coached Australia A during the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia, winning 28–25. Aside from the national team, Australia A was the only side to win against the touring Lions side.\nHe was appointed head coach of Australia before their Tri Nations Series later, following Rod Macqueen's retirement. Under Jones, Australia won the 2001 Tri Nations, and then entered their home World Cup in 2003 as third favourites behind New Zealand and England. They managed to upset the All Blacks in the semi-final before losing to England in the final in extra time through a last-minute drop goal.\nAfter the World Cup, Jones was awarded a contract to lead Australia through to the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He also had an offer to coach Japan which he turned down.\nIn 2005, the Wallabies suffered a spate of injuries, losing seven games straight. At the end of their European tour they lost eight of the last nine matches, with the scrum in particular struggling. After a 22–24 loss to Wales at the Millennium Stadium on 2 December 2005, Jones' contract was terminated.\nQueensland Reds (2007).\nJust over a month after Jones was relieved of his position as Wallabies head coach, he signed a three-year deal with the Queensland Reds to take over as head coach after the 2006 Super 14 season. In February 2006 he joined Saracens in a consultancy role until the end of the season to help them after they were struggling near the bottom of the league.\nJones endured a torrid season with the Reds in 2007, who finished bottom of the Super 14 table, only managing two wins the entire season. Injury spells meant Jones at times had to do without up to eight regulars in his starting team, including the loss of influential Wallabies fullback Chris Latham even before the season started. His last match was an away defeat to the Bulls by a Super Rugby record margin of 89 points, which led to mounting calls in the media for him to be sacked. His stint at the Reds is by far the least successful of his coaching career and he resigned after just one season in charge. During his time at the Reds he was also fined $10,000 dollars for calling the performance of referee Matt Goddard \"disgraceful\" and \"lacking common sense\" after a close 6–3 loss to his former side the Brumbies.\nSouth Africa (2007).\nLater in 2007, Jones turned down an approach from Fiji to be a technical advisor to the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, and instead was appointed by Springbok coach Jake White to be a technical advisor for the South Africa team at the tournament. He was criticised by the ARU Chief Executive John O'Neill for taking up a job to try to help Australia's rivals.\nSouth Africa went on to win the World Cup and Jones was praised for his role in the success, with former coach Nick Mallett calling the move from White to appoint him a \"masterstroke\" and crediting Jones with improved backline play by South Africa at the tournament. Despite being an official part of the Springbok coaching team, Jones was not given a Springbok blazer because he is not South African. He wore his tracksuit instead, a condition in his contract with SA Rugby prior to being appointed.\nAfter the World Cup, Jones rejoined Saracens, initially in an advisory role, before taking over the director of rugby role for the 2008/09 season. However, he announced in February that he would be stepping down at the end of the season for personal reasons, but he then quit early in March 2009 after disagreements with the board. He described this period as the worst he has had in rugby.\nReturn to Japan (2012–2015).\nAfter leaving Saracens, Jones rejoined Suntory Sungoliath in Japan. He brought together a strong team, including George Smith, Fourie du Preez and Danie Rossouw, whom he had coached previously, and led them to victory in the Top League title in 2012, winning the final 47–28 against the Panasonic Wild Knights, as well as two consecutive All Japan Championship wins.\nFollowing the resignation of Sir John Kirwan, Jones was appointed in 2012 as head coach of the Japan national team, to lead them to the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He quickly took the team in a different direction from Kirwan. His first move as the Japan coach was to reduce the number of foreign players, who had been a prominent part of the Japan team under Kirwan, and to encourage the Japanese to play their own style. He also said his goal was to bring Japan up a level, to be among the top 10.\nDespite losing all three of his first Pacific Nations Cup matches by narrow margins, in November 2012 Jones coached the side to their first ever wins in Europe, beating Romania and Georgia.\nIn 2013, Jones led Japan to their sixth consecutive championship win in the Asian Five Nations, where they achieved a tournament record score of 121–0 against the Philippines. Japan lost to Tonga in the opening round of the 2013 IRB Pacific Nations Cup, and were later defeated by Fiji in round 2. Following these matches, Jones coached the \"Brave Blossoms\" to a series draw against Wales after narrowly losing the first test 18–22 and winning the second test 23–8. This was the first time Japan had recorded a victory over the Welsh.\nOn 16 October, Jones was hospitalised for two days after a suspected stroke.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.abc.net\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With his release from hospital, it was announced that he would miss Japan's 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests against New Zealand, Scotland, Gloucester, Russia and Spain, and that former Australia skills coach and current technical adviser for Japan, Scott Wisemantel, would coach Japan in the interim for the end-of-year tests.\nIn 2014, Jones secured Japan's seventh consecutive Asian Five Nations title, before jointly winning the 2014 IRB Pacific Nations Cup with Fiji. Japan won the Asia/Pacific conference with victories over Canada 34–25 and the United States 37–29. In June of that year, Japan claimed a 26–23 victory over Italy, which was Japan's tenth consecutive win, a record for a Tier 2 team. During the 2014 end-of-year rugby union internationals, Japan lost their series with the Māori All Blacks 2–0, but went on to secure an 18–13 win over Romania. Following this victory, Japan rose to ninth in the World Rankings, their highest-ever position, and achieved Jones' aim of reaching the top 10 in the world.\nIn 2015, after securing the 2015 Asian Rugby Championship, Japan suffered three consecutive losses in the 2015 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup. After beating Canada 20–6, they lost to the United States, Fiji and Tonga to finish fourth with just one win. Japan later went on to beat Uruguay twice and Georgia in World Cup Warm-up matches. At the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Japan managed an upset win over South Africa with a spectacular last-minute try in their first pool match, finishing the match 34–32, an incredible victory with bold determination. However, Japan lost four days later to Scotland 45–10, despite still being in contention at half time. A week later, Japan secured a record victory over Samoa, winning 26–5, which guaranteed a top three finish for Japan in the pool. In the final match of the pool stage, Japan beat the United States 28–18, meaning that Japan became the first ever nation to record three victories in the pool stage while failing to advance to the knock out stage. That victory was Jones' last in charge of Japan.\nStormers (2015).\nAfter completing his duties at the helm of Japan's national team at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Jones joined Super Rugby franchise the Stormers in Cape Town on 12 November 2015. Just eight days after joining the Stormers, he was signed by England Rugby as Stuart Lancaster's replacement, to become England's first foreign head coach. The RFU paid a compensation figure of £100,000 to release him from his contract with the Stormers due to a break clause in the agreement. In November 2015, Jones became one of the highest-paid head coaches in world rugby.\nEngland (2015–2022).\nJones was named as the new England head coach on 20 November 2015. He agreed a four-year deal to become England's first foreign head coach, that would see him lead the team through the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The deal was extended twice and was scheduled to last until the end of 2023 World Cup. Jones brought in as his assistant coaches Steve Borthwick from Bristol, with whom he had also coached Japan, and Paul Gustard from Saracens.\nIn 2016, the coaching team led England to their first Grand Slam in 13 years, when they defeated all their opponents at the Six Nations Championship. They opened with a 15–9 win over Scotland before seeing out Italy 40–9. In Jones' first home game on 27 February 2016, he led England to a 21–10 victory over Ireland, before they went on to beat Wales 25–21 two weeks later; at one point in the match they were leading the Welsh team 19–0, but then conceded three tries in the second half. England secured the Championship on 13 March with one game in hand when Scotland beat France, meaning that England went into the final round having already secured the title. A 31–21 victory over France in the final game of the Championship on 19 March saw England win their first Grand Slam since 2003.\nThree months later, Jones took his English side on a tour of Australia for a three-test series against Australia; England won the series 3–0 in their first-ever three-test series victory. They scored their most points against Australia in the first test, winning 39–28, and claimed their third consecutive victory over \"the Wallabies\" on Australian soil when they won the second test 23–7, a record-winning streak for the game played in Australia's home territory. The final test confirmed the series whitewash, England winning the match 44–40. During the series, Jones had led England from fourth in the world to second. In the 2016 Autumn Internationals, he guided England through to their 14th consecutive win, 13 of these under his leadership, and they became just the second team after New Zealand to win every one of their games in a calendar year. Jones then led England to a 37–21 win against South Africa, their first victory over \"the Springboks\" since 2006. England later saw off Fiji 58–15, before beating Argentina 27–14 a week later, this despite an England player being sent off after five minutes. England finished the autumn tests with a 37–21 win over Australia.\nDuring the 2017 Six Nations Championship, Jones experienced his first defeat as England head coach when the team travelled to Dublin for their final game of the Championship, which they lost 9–13. Not only would a win have secured England's second consecutive Grand Slam but it would also have been a record 19th consecutive victory. Despite this disappointment, England were the overall winners of the Championship with wins over France (19–16), Wales (21–16), Italy (36–15), and Scotland (61–21). In June 2017, Jones took an inexperienced side for a two-test series in Argentina; the team included 18 uncapped players, eight of whom were less than 21 years old. Nevertheless, England won the series 2–0 with a 38–34 victory in the first test and a 35–25 victory in the second. England continued their form during the 2017 Autumn Internationals, winning all three of their tests: 21–8 against Argentina, 30–6 against Australia, and 48–14 against Samoa.\nEngland finished the 2018 Six Nations Championship in their lowest-ever position in the league table, and their worst since the 1983 Five Nations Championship, finishing in fifth place having only beaten Italy (46–15) and Wales (12–6). England's consecutive losses to Scotland, France and Ireland were their first triple defeat since 2014. Their loss to Scotland was the first since 2010, and their loss to Ireland was the first at home since 2010. A 45–63 loss against the Barbarians followed in May of the same year, with former England international Chris Ashton scoring a hat-trick of tries against his ex-teammates. England's run of defeats continued into the June test series, when they lost the first two matches of their three-test series against South Africa. However, they avoided a 3–0 series defeat by winning the third test 25–10 to claim their first win in South Africa since 2000. When former New Zealand and U.S. coach John Mitchell joined the coaching team as defence coach, England achieved a return win (12–11) against South Africa in a tightly contested match on 3 November in the 2018 Autumn Internationals. Another close-fought test against New Zealand a week later also finished with a single-point scoreline difference (15–16), but this time in favour of the opposition. England then won their remaining autumn tests against Japan (35–15) and Australia (37–18). The win against the \"Wallabies\" was England's sixth consecutive victory over the Australians, continuing their perfect record against Jones' former team during his tenure.\nEngland drew 38–38 with Scotland in the 2019 Six Nations Championship, meaning that Scotland retained the Calcutta Cup. England had led 31–0 just half an hour into the match but Scotland scored six unanswered tries to go 38–31 ahead with five minutes remaining, only for England to tie the score with a converted try in the last play of the match. Jones claimed that his team had a recurring \"mental block\" that needed fixing after a similar incident three weeks previously against Wales. The 38–38 draw is currently the highest-scoring tied match in international rugby history.\nJones guided England to their first World Cup final since 2007 when they beat reigning world champions New Zealand 19–7 in the semi-finals of the 2019 Rugby World Cup. South Africa overpowered England in the final a week later to deliver a 32–12 defeat, ending Jones' ambition of leading his team to World Cup glory in Japan.\nOn 6 December 2022, Jones was sacked as England head coach by the RFU following a poor run of results in which England had won just 5 of 12 tests in 2022. Jones left England with a win percentage of 73%, the highest of any England coach.\nReturn to Australia (2023).\nIn January 2023, Jones was re-appointed as the head coach of Australia, replacing Dave Rennie, and returning to his former post after . The appointment was reported to be worth A$4.5 million over the tenure of the appointment, to run until the conclusion of Australia's campaign at the 2027 Rugby World Cup, in which Australia will also host. Jones would simultaneously \"oversee\" the women's team. Jones formally began his role as head coach on 29 January 2023.\nBefore taking the job as Australia coach, Jones and Rugby Australia (RA) executives, Hamish McLennan and Andy Marinos, had held numerous talks dating back six months, reportedly only days after the 2022 England tour of Australia. Although they were initially reported as insignificant due to Jones' England duties and Dave Rennie's contract (which lasted until the end of the 2023 Rugby World Cup), speculation was significantly heightened when Jones was let go by the RFU in December 2022.\nJones' first match as head coach of Australia was against South Africa in Pretoria. Jones' last match against South Africa in Pretoria was in the 2005 Tri Nations Series, which ended in a 22–16 defeat. Although Australia scored the first try of the match, and led for the first fifteen-minutes of the match, South Africa scored forty-three unanswered points, winning the match 43–12. It is the Springboks' third biggest victory over Australia by margin. They followed this up with a 31–34 loss to Argentina the following week. Two weeks later, in the third, and final, round of the 2023 Rugby Championship (which was shortened due to the Rugby World Cup) Australia lost to New Zealand 7–38 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Due to suffering three consecutive defeats, Australia finished wooden spooners for the first time since the expansion of the competition in 2012.\nIn the lead-up to the Rugby World Cup, Australia played just two fixtures: against New Zealand following the conclusion of the Rugby Championship, and one warm-up fixture against hosts France. The match against New Zealand was the closest (alongside Australia–Argentina meeting) Australia had come to a victory during the year, losing 23–20. The latter match (against France), played at the Stade de France, was another heavy defeat; Australia losing 41–17.\nBy the time of Australia's opening encounter with Georgia in Pool C of the World Cup, they were 9th in the World Rugby Rankings (second-best in their pool), and had not won a match from five attempts. At the World Cup, Australia beat Georgia 35-15, and then lost 15-22 to Fiji. This was Fiji's biggest win over Australia, and their first in 69 years. Australia then lost 6-40 to Wales, in a game they effectively needed to win to progress to the knockout stages. This was the biggest defeat of Jones's tenure, and Australia's eighth largest defeat ever. In their last match, Australia defeated Portugal 34-14, but did not advance to the next round. This was the first World Cup when Australia were knocked out in the first round. \nOn 25 September 2023, the day after Australia lost to Wales, it was reported that Jones had held an interview for the job as coach of Japan, while in France preparing for the World Cup. Jones denied the reports, and the Japan Rugby Football Union would not comment. \nOn 29 October 2023, Jones resigned as coach of Australia.\nReturn to Japan (2023).\nIn December 2023, the Japan Rugby Football Union announced the re-appointment of Eddie Jones as its head coach, a position he had previously held from 2012 to 2015. Jones is set to officially begin his duties on 1 January 2024.\nGoldman Sachs.\nIn November 2015 Jones was appointed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to the bank's advisory board in Japan.\nOther honours.\nRandwick\nJapan \"(as assistant coach)\"\nBrumbies\nSouth Africa \"(Technical advisor)\"\nSuntory Sungoliath\nPopular culture.\nJones is featured in the documentary \"Eddie Jones: Rugby, Japan and Me\", which aired on Sky Sports on 31 October 2018.\nNew Zealand actor Temuera Morrison portrays Jones in the 2019 film \"The Brighton Miracle\"."

He had never kicked in a college game until the 2000 season, but he emerged as one of the most consistent kickers (and punter) in the country. He was an honorable mention All-ACC pick as a senior and a second-team All-ACC player as a junior. He entered the 2000 season as a walk-on, but he earned a scholarship after connecting on 28-of-36 field goal attempts and 66-of-67 extra points. His 66 consecutive PATs set a UNC record. He was one of 20 semifinalists for the Lou Groza Award, which is given annually to the nation's top kicker. Reed was first-team Academic All-ACC.\nWhile at UNC, Reed was teammates with running back Willie Parker, his future teammate with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nAfter an unsuccessful tryout with the New Orleans Saints during the 2002 preseason, Reed joined the Pittsburgh Steelers as a free agent during the regular season. Originally signed as a midseason replacement to the injured Todd Peterson, Reed quickly contributed to the team, finishing the season with 100 points, which led to the team releasing Peterson in the offseason and making Reed their primary kicker.\nDuring the Steelers 2005 AFC Divisional Playoff game against the New York Jets, Reed kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime after his New York counterpart Doug Brien missed two field goals. During the 2005–06 NFL playoffs, where the Steelers eventually won Super Bowl XL, Reed successfully kicked all three field goal attempts and converted all fourteen of his potential PATs. Reed's streak of 189 consecutive successful PAT's (210 including post-seasons), dating back to the Steelers' week 16 victory over the Chargers in 2003, came to an end on Monday November 3, 2008, against the Washington Redskins.\nDuring Super Bowl XLIII, Reed went 2-for-2 on field goals and 3-for-3 on extra points in the Steelers 27–23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.\nReed is the second-highest scoring Steeler. His 733 points trails Gary Anderson's 1,343. Reed's fallout with the Steelers began on October 18, 2009, Reed was cited again for public intoxication and disorderly conduct related charges on October 18, 2009, hours after the team defeated the Cleveland Browns. The incident occurred when Steelers tight end Matt Spaeth was cited for urinating in public, and Reed refused to comply with police orders to go back inside his SUV. He later apologized to his team for his conduct.\nReed was franchise tagged during the 2010 offseason, and signed his one-year tender on April 13, 2010.\nReed was released on November 16, 2010, two days after missing a 26-yard field goal against the New England Patriots. He was replaced by Shaun Suisham. Reed went unclaimed through waivers and became a free agent, free to sign with any team and still collect the balance of his Steelers' contract ($160,000 each week) for the year in addition to any pay he received from signing with a new team.\nOn November 18, 2010, two days after Reed was released by the Steelers, the Cincinnati Bengals offered Reed a contract. However, he declined.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn December 2, 2010, Reed signed with the San Francisco 49ers to replace their injured kicker, Joe Nedney. Reed had a good outing in his first game, going 3 for 3, including a 44-yard field goal. Reed finished his five-game 49ers' career having hit all of his 13 extra-point attempts and 9 of 10 field goal tries.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nReed signed with the Seattle Seahawks on August 3, 2011, but was released by the team on September 4.\nPersonal life.\nReed's father, Morris, played basketball for Wichita State and his mother, Pam, was a cheerleader for Wichita State. His sister, Kristen, played soccer at UNC Charlotte and one year professionally for the Carolina Speed.\nReed does charity work with \"Kick For Kids,\" which donates $300 for every field goal he makes. Reed is involved in Junior Achievement, does commercials for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and helped a family raise money for a 5-year-old who had a brain tumor.\nReed is known to be eccentric. This has included instances of Reed bleaching his hair and letting it grow out, as well as wearing fuchsia clothing to match his girlfriend's outfit for the team's annual fashion show to raise money for breast cancer awareness. One year for training camp, Reed voluntarily carried around a pink backpack since the team had no rookies on special teams, who would usually carry around the backpack.\nWhile in Pittsburgh, Reed was frequently seen in section C27 of Pittsburgh Penguins games when the Penguins played in Mellon Arena. After the Steelers' win in Super Bowl XLIII, Reed dropped the ceremonial first puck at the Penguins-Tampa Bay Lightning game on February 4, 2009. For the occasion, he wore a rare gold throwback Sunday Mario Lemieux jersey from the mid-1980s.\nReed was cited by police on the night of February 14, 2009, for disorderly conduct and criminal mischief for destroying a paper towel holder in a bathroom at a Sheetz convenience store in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania. Reed was reportedly angry that the men's restroom was out of paper towels. He pleaded guilty to the two summary offenses and was fined $543.50.\nReed was cited again for public intoxication and disorderly conduct related charges on October 18, 2009, hours after the team defeated the Cleveland Browns. The incident occurred when tight end Matt Spaeth was cited for urinating in public, and Reed refused to comply with police orders to go back inside his SUV. He later apologized to his team for his conduct.\nReed currently hosts a Saturday morning talk show on WZGV-AM in Charlotte."

        "title": "WrestleMania 13",
        "text": "WrestleMania 13 was the 13th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). The event was presented by PlayStation and held on March 23, 1997, at the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois. Eight matches were held at the event, including one on the \"Free for All\" pre-show.\nThe main event was a no disqualification match between The Undertaker and Sycho Sid for the WWF Championship, which Undertaker won following interference from Bret Hart. The main matches on the undercard were Bret Hart versus Stone Cold Steve Austin in a No Disqualification Submission match, Legion of Doom and Ahmed Johnson versus Nation of Domination in a Chicago Street Fight, and Rocky Maivia versus The Sultan for the WWF Intercontinental Championship.\nWrestleMania 13 was the second WrestleMania to take place in the Chicago metropolitan area, following WrestleMania 2. The event was attended by 18,197 who paid a total of $837,150 in admission fees, and drew a 0.77 buy rate. The event as a whole received mixed to negative reviews. However, the submission match between Bret Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin was highly praised, being called one of the greatest matches in wrestling history, and has been cited by some as the beginning of the Attitude Era.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF, now WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of the WWF's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. WrestleMania 13 was scheduled to be held on March 23, 1997, at the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois. The event was presented by PlayStation.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into WrestleMania 13 was between The Undertaker and Sycho Sid, with the two battling over the WWF Championship. At in February, Bret Hart last eliminated The Undertaker in the Final Four match to win the vacant WWF Championship. Hart's reign, however, lasted only one day as he lost the title the next night on \"Monday Night Raw\" to Sycho Sid after interference by Stone Cold Steve Austin, one of the other participants in the Final Four match (the other was Vader, who had no further involvement in the ongoing storyline). Due to being the runner-up to the title at Final Four, Undertaker was made the number one contender and was booked to challenge Sycho Sid for the title at WrestleMania. However, on the March 17 edition of \"Raw Is War\", Sid defended the title against Hart in a steel cage match, with the winner defending his title at WrestleMania. During the match, both Undertaker and Austin interfered. Undertaker came out to help Sid because he wanted to wrestle Sid for the title while Austin helped Hart because he wanted to make his scheduled submission match with Hart a title match. Sid won the match and retained his title and as a result, Sid vs. Undertaker remained the main event of WrestleMania.\nThe second main match on the card was Bret Hart versus Stone Cold Steve Austin in a Submission match. Hart and Austin's rivalry began after Austin won the 1996 King of the Ring tournament and began taunting Hart, who was inactive at the time. Austin insulted Hart in his speeches so Hart would accept his challenge to a match. Hart returned in October and accepted Austin's challenge, with the two facing each other at Survivor Series 1996 where Hart defeated Austin. Their rivalry continued as Hart and Austin were the final two participants in the 1997 Royal Rumble match. Hart had originally eliminated Austin from the match but Austin's elimination was considered unofficial because the officials did not see it as they were busy attending to a brawl between eliminated wrestlers Mankind and Terry Funk. They were participants in a Four Corners Elimination match for the vacant WWF Championship at , which Hart won. The next night on \"Monday Night Raw\", Austin cost Hart the WWF Championship against Sycho Sid when Hart had applied the Sharpshooter on Sid, Austin nailed Hart with a steel chair followed by Sid powerbombing Hart for the win. Hart and Austin were booked to wrestle in a submission match at WrestleMania, but Hart got a shot at the WWF Championship in a steel cage match on the March 17 edition of \"Raw Is War\", with the winner defending the title against The Undertaker at WrestleMania 13. Hart almost had the match won, until Undertaker interfered and helped Sid in getting the victory.\nOne of the main undercard matches was a Chicago Street Fight featuring Ahmed Johnson and Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) against Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush and Savio Vega). Johnson was attacked by a newcomer Faarooq Asad, a Roman gladiator on the July 22, 1996 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\" during a match for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Ahmed was scheduled to defend his Intercontinental Championship against Faarooq at SummerSlam 1996 but legitimate kidney problems forced him to vacate the Intercontinental Championship. In the storyline, it was explained that Faarooq had caused Ahmed's kidney problem. Ahmed returned from his injury in early 1997 and continued with Faarooq, who had formed The Nation of Domination during Ahmed's absence. Ahmed joined forces with the Legion of Doom and the trio were scheduled to wrestle the Nation of Domination in a Chicago Street Fight at WrestleMania 13.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view (PPV), Billy Gunn faced Flash Funk at Free for All. Gunn defeated Funk by pinning him following a tornado DDT.\nThe first match that aired on television was a Four-Way Tag Team Elimination Match. The match featured The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher), The Godwinns (Henry O. Godwinn and Phineas I. Godwinn), The New Blackjacks (Blackjack Windham and Blackjack Bradshaw) and the team of Doug Furnas and Phil LaFon. All the teams wrestled each other and sometimes in the match, teammates also fought against each other. Barry Windham and Phil LaFon brawled to the outside the ring. Bradshaw attacked the referee and got disqualified, which led to the first elimination of the match while Furnas was counted-out. Headbangers and Godwinns were the remaining teams and they battled for five minutes and 39 seconds before Thrasher hit Phineas with a Cannonball Senton and won the match via pinfall. As a result of winning the match, Headbangers earned a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship.\nThe second match was between Rocky Maivia and The Sultan for Maivia's WWF Intercontinental Championship. The Honky Tonk Man provided commentary for the match. Sultan had an early advantage in the match due to his size and power but Maivia used his quicker moves to push the big man outside the ring. Sultan overpowered Maivia with slams and punches but was unable to pin him. Maivia gained advantage on Sultan by nailing him with a belly to belly suplex, Maivia Hurricane and a flying crossbody before pinning Sultan with a roll-up to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Sultan and his managers, Bob Backlund and The Iron Sheik attacked Maivia before his father, Rocky Johnson, came out to help his son.\nThe third match was between Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Goldust. Goldust dominated the early portion of the match. Helmsley had brief flurries of offense but Goldust had still the advantage. Helmsley began using submission maneuvers to keep the advantages for himself. Goldust was going to hit his maneuver until Helmsley's bodyguard Chyna manhandled Goldust's wife Marlena to distract him. Helmsley took advantage and hit Goldust with a Pedigree, enabling him to pin Goldust for the win.\nThe fourth match was a tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, as Owen Hart and The British Bulldog defended the titles against Mankind and Vader. The big Vader made easy work of Owen in the beginning of the match. Vader tagged in with Mankind while Owen tagged in with Bulldog. Bulldog and Mankind punched each other but Bulldog had more advantage. He applied a sleeper hold on Mankind which caused both of them to fall to the outside. They continued to brawl outside. The referee was distracted due to the brawl. Vader took advantage and hit Bulldog with Paul Bearer's urn and dragged him into the ring. Vader and Mankind both took turns and continued to attack Bulldog. Owen tried to save his partner, but Vader used his strength while Mankind used his cheating tactics to overwhelm Owen. Mankind trapped Bulldog to the outside and applied the mandible claw on him. Both men were counted out as the match resulted in a draw. As a result, Hart and Bulldog retained the championship.\nThe fifth match was a No Disqualification Submission match between Bret Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin. UFC fighter Ken Shamrock was the special guest referee for this match. Austin attacked Hart, who was still in his entrance attire. The two first beat each other in the ring before the action spilled outside the ring. Hart tossed Austin into the steel ring post while Austin drove him onto the steel barrier. The two men began fighting in the crowd, where both men hit each other with several foreign objects. They moved up the steps high into the crowd. Shamrock followed them and brought them back towards the ring where Austin attempted to use steel steps on Hart, but Hart stopped him with a kick to the midsection. As the action began in the ring, Hart focused on Austin's leg. He busted Austin open with an Irish whip into the steel barricade and Austin's head began to bleed profusely. Hart tried to use a steel chair on Austin's leg, but Austin choked Hart with a television cable. Hart hit Austin in the head with the ring bell. He applied a Sharpshooter on Austin who did not submit and tried to resist but passed out from the pain and loss of blood. Shamrock awarded the match to Hart, but Hart continued to attack Austin which led to a double-turn as the fans turned on Hart and began cheering for Austin. Shamrock pulled Hart off of Austin and executed a waistlock takedown and physically challenged him to a fight. Hart declined to fight Shamrock and left the ring to a chorus of boos. Austin, meanwhile, after regaining consciousness, hit a Stunner on a referee when he tried to help Austin out, then slowly limped away to backstage, while the crowd chanted his name.\nThe sixth match of the event was a Chicago Street Fight between the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) and Ahmed Johnson and Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush and Savio Vega). All the two teams hit each other with many foreign objects. The match continued inside the ring and outside the ring in the same fashion. Finally, Animal hit Crush with a 2x4 and then pinned him to win the match.\nMain Event.\nThe main event was a No Disqualification Match between The Undertaker and reigning champion Sycho Sid for the WWF Championship. Shawn Michaels provided commentary for the match. The then-heel superstar, Bret Hart, came out during the match and insulted Undertaker, Michaels and particularly Sid because he claimed that Sid had screwed him out of the title. Sid powerbombed Hart while Undertaker took advantage and began attacking the champion from behind. Undertaker went for an Old School but Sid took him in a bearhug. Sid attacked Undertaker with various moves and attacked him with television monitors, and applied a camel clutch on Undertaker. Sid had the advantage in the match until Hart came back and attacked Sid with a steel chair. He recovered and got Undertaker in the powerbomb but Hart returned again and distracted Sid which allowed Undertaker to hit Sid with the Tombstone and pin him to win the match.\nReception.\nThe event was attended by 18,197 who paid a total of $837,150 in admission fees and drew a 0.77 buy-rate.\nIn 2011, Marc Elusive of 411mania gave the event an overall score of 7.0 out of 10.0 and noted that \"The Attitude Era began here...\" and that the main event was \"a very boring match\". John Canton of \"The John Report\" gave the event an overall score of 4 out of 10 and said that the show was \"poor\" and noted that the main event \"sucked for the first 15 minutes, but the ending was okay\".\nDespite the lackluster reviews towards the event, the submission match between Hart and Austin was highly praised. In 2007, it was placed #1 on IGN's list of Top 20 Matches in WrestleMania History, and described as a match that \"launched an era.\" Thomas Golianopoulos of \"Complex Sports\" also ranked it at number 1 in his list of the 50 Greatest Matches in WrestleMania History, citing the match's six factors of storyline, innovation, psychology, finish, post-match angle, and fallout. Elusive of 411mania described the match as \"outstanding\" and \"that helped propel Steve Austin into the stratosphere and become the star of the late 90s and the early 00s\", while also noting the double-turn after the match. John Canton called the match a \"wrestling perfection\". It received a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer and was also voted Match of the Year (1997) by readers of his \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" publication. \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers named it Match of the Year (1997). The submission match would also be the last time a WrestleMania match would receive a five-star rating until WrestleMania 39 in 2023 when Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn vs Jimmy and Jey Uso on Night 1 and Gunther vs Sheamus vs Drew McIntyre on Night 2 both received the five-star rating. Hart would call it his favourite match, labeling it \"a real masterpiece.\" Ken Shamrock would call it \"one of the greatest matches in wrestling history\", and Jim Ross called it the greatest match he'd called at WrestleMania and the most \"well-executed\" match he'd seen.\nAftermath.\nStone Cold Steve Austin and Bret Hart continued their rivalry after WrestleMania, but Austin was now a babyface and his popularity would start to increase considerably while Hart was a heel. Hart recruited British Bulldog, Owen Hart, Brian Pillman and former tag team partner Jim Neidhart to reform The Hart Foundation. At in April, Hart and Austin had a match which Austin won by disqualification. Their feud continued until in July, where the Hart Foundation (working as faces in Canada) defeated the American team of Austin, Ken Shamrock, Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) and Goldust.\nThe Undertaker received a push after he won his second WWF Championship at WrestleMania 13. He spent a reign of 133 days which included battles with Mankind, Steve Austin, Faarooq and Vader. At SummerSlam 1997, Undertaker's long reign finally ended when he lost the title to Bret Hart when special guest referee Shawn Michaels accidentally struck Undertaker with a steel chair, which was intended for Hart.\nAfter losing the WWF Championship to The Undertaker at WrestleMania, Sycho Sid's push began to diminish and after King of the Ring, he began to disappear from WWF programming. In actuality, Sid quietly left WWF to focus on recovering from a neck injury. Sid eventually returned to rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1999 and continued to wrestle as Sid Vicious until he suffered a near career-ending leg injury at WCW Sin on January 14, 2001."

        "title": "Women's Test cricket",
        "text": "Women's Test cricket is the longest format of women's cricket and is the female equivalent to men's Test cricket. Matches comprise four-innings and are held over a maximum of four days between two of the leading cricketing nations. The rules governing the format differ little from those for the men's game, with differences generally being technicalities surrounding umpiring and field size.\nThe first women's Test match was played by England women and Australia women in December 1934, a three-day contest held in Brisbane which England won by nine wickets. A total of 144 Women's Test matches have been played. Far fewer matches are played each year in favour of Women's One Day Internationals and Women's Twenty20 Internationals, with the international calendar revolving around the shorter formats of the game.\nPlaying conditions.\nWomen's Test cricket is subject to the Laws of cricket, with a number of variations and refinements, which are set out in the ICC's \"Women's Test match playing conditions\" document. For the most part, these playing conditions are very similar to those set out for men's Test cricket. Matches are played between two teams of eleven players, across up to four innings. Test cricket can have three results: a tie, a draw, or one team wins.\nThe primary, and most noticeable, difference from the men's game is that women's Test matches are typically played over four days, rather than five. However, the players are expected to fit more overs in per hour in the women's game than the men's: 17 as opposed to 15, and so a full day's play in a women's Test match should include 100 overs, rather than 90. The cricket field has smaller dimensions; the boundaries must be between , in contrast to the required in men's Tests. As well as playing on a smaller field, the women use a smaller and lighter ball than their male counterparts; the Laws of cricket dictate that women should use a ball that is between and ounces (139.98 and 150.61 grams); which could be up to ounces (23.03 grams) lighter than the ball used by the men. The Decision Review System (UDRS) is now available in women's Test matches, also umpires are permitted to ask the third umpire to check television replays in certain cases.\nAs women's tests are often played over four days, the minimum lead to impose a follow-on is 150 runs, as opposed to a 200 run lead when played over five days. This is consistent with four/five day men's test matches.\nNations.\nIn all, ten national women's teams have competed in Test cricket. The England team's tour of Australia and New Zealand in the 1934–35 season established the first three sides, and it is those three teams that have competed in Test cricket most frequently; each having played at least 45 matches. South Africa were the next side to play the format, contesting their first match in 1960. However, due to their exclusion from international sport due to the nation's apartheid policy, they have only played in thirteen Test matches, fewer than India. Four sides — Pakistan, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sri Lanka — have competed in fewer than five Test matches.\nThe nations with men's and women's test teams do not entirely overlap. Of full members with men's test teams, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe do not have women's test teams. Netherlands, while not a test team in the men's game, are a test playing nation in the women's game. Ireland, while having both men's and women's test teams, unusually played a women's test match, their only one to date, seventeen years before their first men's test match - on both test debuts, the opponent was Pakistan. The eight other full members, including Pakistan, have played men's, and then women's, test cricket.\nRecent developments.\nAs of April 2019, there had only been one Women's Test match in the previous three years, and only two teams other than England and Australia had played in a Women's Test in the previous ten years. Australia's captain, Meg Lanning, expressed her interest in more Women's Test matches being played. In July 2019, following the conclusion of the one-off Women's Ashes Test in England, the question was raised about whether Women's Test matches should be played across five days, instead of four. The match had two sessions washed out and finished in a draw.\nIn December 2019, New Zealand's Sophie Devine requested that administrators arrange a Women's Test match between New Zealand and Australia, following a strong performance in the Women's Big Bash League. New Zealand's women last played in a Test match in 2004, and their last encounter against Australia in the format was in 1996. In June 2020, during an ICC webinar, Devine and India's Jemimah Rodrigues both supported the idea of a multi-format series for women's cricket.\nIn April 2021, the ICC awarded permanent Test and One Day International (ODI) status to all full member women's teams.\nOn International Women's Day 2021, it was announced that India and England would play a one-off Test later in the year. The Test was played at Bristol County Ground, between 16 and 19 June 2021. Additionally, the Board of Control for Cricket in India was said to be in talks with Cricket Australia about a possible Test match between India and Australia.\nBetween 2000 and June 2021, only thirty women's Test matches were played, with fourteen of those being Ashes Tests between Australia and England.\nOn 20 May 2021, Cricket Australia confirmed that an Australia versus India Test match would be played at the WACA Ground, Perth, between 30 September and 3 October 2021. Due to COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions, the match was later moved to Metricon Stadium on the Gold Coast in Queensland. Another Test match, between Australia and England, was played at Manuka Oval, Canberra, between 27 and 30 January 2022, as part of the 2021–22 Women's Ashes series. Both of these matches ended in a draw.\nIn an interview on the BBC \"Test Match Special\" radio programme during the 1st Test of the New Zealand men's tour of England in early June 2022, Greg Barclay, Chair of the International Cricket Council (ICC), asserted that women's Test cricket will not be \"part of the landscape moving forward to any real extent\". The assertion generated significant controversy, and also calls from former women's Test cricketers and others for the ICC to return control of the women's game to women's cricket associations.\nAt the end of June 2022, England and South Africa played their first women's Test match against each other since 2003. The match was South Africa's first women's Test since November 2014. It was played at the County Ground, Taunton, England, and was the first stage of a multi-format South African tour of England.\nRecords.\nDue to the infrequent playing of women's Test cricket outside of Australia, England and New Zealand, cumulative records, such as the most runs during a career, are dominated by players from those three nations. England's Jan Brittin has scored the most runs during her career, totalling 1,935 during her 27 matches, and 18 of the top twenty players come from either Australia, England or New Zealand. The Australian batsman Denise Annetts, who is 15th on that list, has the highest batting average, 81.90, from her ten matches. Annetts was also involved in the largest partnership in women's Test cricket, sharing a stand of 309 runs with Lindsay Reeler in 1987. Eight women have scored double centuries in Test cricket; the highest of these was the 242 runs scored by Pakistan's Kiran Baluch against the West Indies in 2004.\nMary Duggan, who played for England between 1949 and 1963 is the leading wicket-taker in women's Test cricket, claiming 77 wickets from 17 matches. The next most prolific bowler is Australia's Betty Wilson, who claimed her 68 wickets at the lowest bowling average, 11.80 and the first hat-trick in Women's Test cricket. Both of the players with the best bowling figures, in an innings and in a match, are from the Indian subcontinent; India's Neetu David holds the record for the best figures in an innings, having taken eight second innings wickets against England in 1995, while Pakistan's Shaiza Khan took thirteen wickets in a match against the West Indies in 2004.\nAmongst wicket-keepers, Christina Matthews has taken the most dismissals in her career, accumulating 46 catches and 12 stumpings during her 20 matches for Australia. Lisa Nye holds the record for the most dismissals in a single innings, having been responsible for eight of the ten wickets for England against New Zealand in 1992. Only two players have achieved the all-rounders double of scoring a century and taking ten wickets in the same match; Betty Wilson did it against England in 1958, while Enid Bakewell managed it for England against the West Indies in 1979. Wilson's performance was the first time such a feat had been achieved in Men's or Women's Tests and also included the first hat-trick in Women's Tests."

Eight nations competed, with the preliminary phase consisting of each team playing every other team. Playoffs were then held, with the four highest ranked teams advancing. For the semifinals, the 1st place team played the 4th place team and the 2nd place team played against the 3rd place team. The winners of those semifinals competed against each other for the gold medal, with the loser getting the silver medal. The teams defeated in the semifinal played a match for the bronze medal.\nBaseball was an event open only to amateurs for the second and last time. Meanwhile, Cuba used its best players as they were amateurs in name only, with all necessary funding coming from the state."

        "title": "1998 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1998 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1998 playoffs of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the conclusion of the 1997–98 NBA season. The two-time defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls played against the Western Conference champion Utah Jazz, with the Jazz holding home-court advantage for the first 2 games in Salt Lake City. In a repeat of the previous year's Finals, the Bulls won the series 4 games to 2 for their third consecutive NBA title and their sixth in eight seasons.\nMichael Jordan was voted the NBA Finals MVP of the series (he also had won the award the last five times the Bulls won the Finals: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, and 1997). This would be his sixth NBA championship and sixth Finals MVP award in six full basketball seasons. This would be his final season of winning the NBA championship and Finals MVP.\nThe 1998 Finals garnered the highest Nielsen TV ratings in NBA history at 18.7, and even surpassed the Nielsen ratings for the 1998 World Series, marking the first time the NBA had a higher rating in its championship round than of Major League Baseball's championship round.\nThe Bulls headed into the series as the underdogs. Bulls' small forward Scottie Pippen stated, \"It's a different feeling. We’ve never been in this situation where we’ve sort of been written off. It’s a great feeling being the underdog because you want to go out now and prove everybody wrong.\"\nBackground.\nThe series marked the first time since 1989 that the same two teams met in the Finals in consecutive years. The Jazz earned the league's best record by virtue of sweeping the two-game regular season series with the Bulls despite both teams finishing at 62 wins. In the playoffs, the Jazz were pushed to the brink by the Houston Rockets before winning Game 5 in Utah, and then overcame Rookie of the Year Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs 4–1. They then swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. The Bulls swept the New Jersey Nets and then took out the Charlotte Hornets in five, but it took seven games to overcome the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nRegular season series.\nThe Utah Jazz won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nBulls win the series 4–2.\nGame 4.\nCrowd: 24,000 at United Center(sellout)\nGame summaries.\nGames 1 and 2.\nUnlike the 1997 Finals, the Jazz and Bulls entered this series as equals. The Jazz had won both regular season meetings with the Bulls, and many analysts predicted a hard-fought seven-game series. The two teams entered the Finals on completely different notes; the Jazz uneventfully swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals and had a total of ten days' rest before the Finals began. The Bulls, meanwhile, endured a hard-fought series against a resurgent Indiana Pacers team helmed by Larry Bird (in his first year as head coach). They would need all seven games to get past the Pacers and would have only two days' rest before having to travel to Utah. Predictions of a Jazz championship were strengthened with their 88–85 Game 1 victory in overtime in Utah, with Scottie Pippen just missing a 3-pointer at the buzzer. True to form, the Bulls tied the series in Game 2 while putting together a huge fourth-quarter run to silence the Delta Center and holding on to win 93–88, finally securing their first victory against Utah all season. Karl Malone shot very poorly in the first two games of the series with some misses including one layup in Game 2 that hit the underside of the rim. The plane took 48 hours to get to the United Center or the airport.\nGames 3–5.\nThe Finals moved to Chicago with control of the series at stake in Game 3. In a 96–54 loss, the Jazz set the record for the 42 point loss in Finals history and were hammered by the media for the score, as well as the lowest number of points scored in any NBA game (since eclipsed by a score of 49 from the Bulls on April 10, 1999) since the inception of the shot clock. Every player on the Bulls roster scored at least once, with the Bulls' last-remaining scoreless player, backup center Bill Wennington, nailing his bucket with only 5.2 seconds remaining in the game.\nChicago won Game 4 in a close game, 86-82, and Utah took Game 5 83–81 despite nearly blowing a seven-point lead in the last two minutes. Karl Malone had his best game of the series with 39 points, while Antoine Carr made all five of his field goal attempts. The series returned to Utah with the Bulls leading 3-2.\nGame 6.\nAs they arrived at the Delta Center for Game 6, things didn't look good for the Bulls. Scottie Pippen, whose back was already injured going into the game, aggravated his injury when he dunked the opening basket of the game. He scored only 8 points the whole game. To keep pace with Utah, the Bulls were forced to rely almost entirely on Michael Jordan, who scored 23 points in the first half. Emotions ran high at the Delta Center when the Jazz suffered a critical shot clock violation in the second quarter. Referee Dick Bavetta ruled that Howard Eisley did not get a successful 3-point shot off in time, although TV replays showed that the ball was out of Eisley's hands just before the shot clock hit zero. Later in the fourth quarter, Jordan's two free throws tied the game with only a minute left. The Jazz received some relief as John Stockton hit a 3 with 41.9 seconds left to give Utah an 86–83 lead and sent the Delta Center into a frenzy.\nAfter Jordan made a layup to make it 86–85, the Bulls needed to stop the Jazz from scoring again. When John Stockton passed the ball to Karl Malone, Jordan stole the ball away and dribbled down the court. Guarding him was Bryon Russell, one of the Jazz's best defenders. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left. Jordan hit the 20-footer after crossing over Russell while apparently initiating contact, but replays would show that he did not, to give the Bulls an 87–86 lead with 5.2 seconds left. After a time-out, Stockton missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer, giving the Bulls their sixth NBA title in 8 years. Jordan, who scored 45 points, and whose game-winning shot has been immortalized around the world, was named Finals MVP for the sixth time.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Finals were televised in the United States by NBC, with Bob Costas on play-by-play and Doug Collins and Isiah Thomas serving as color analysts. Hannah Storm hosted the pre-game show, assisted by Bill Walton, John Salley and Peter Vescey, and Ahmad Rashad and Jim Gray reported from the sidelines. This was the first time since NBC took over the broadcasting rights to the NBA Finals in 1991 that Marv Albert was not the play by play commentator. He was fired from NBC on September 25, 1997, for sexually assaulting a woman.\nAftermath.\nWorld Championship Wrestling would capitalize on the animosity following the Finals between Rodman and Malone, as on July 12, 1998, Rodman and Hollywood Hogan would defeat Malone and Diamond Dallas Page in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach.\n, this series remains the last Finals appearances for both the Bulls and Jazz. After the season, the Bulls dynasty broke up. Without its key personnel, the Bulls missed the playoffs in the lockout-shortened 1999 season, winning just 13 of 50 games. The Bulls would not make the postseason again until 2005.\nPhil Jackson declined an offer from the team president to coach another season. He would come back as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999, winning five NBA titles in two separate stints with the team before retiring in 2011. This would give Jackson 11 NBA Titles, the most for a coach in the history of the four major American sports leagues. Ron Harper followed Jackson to the Lakers and won championships during his final two seasons, in 2000 and 2001.\nOn January 13, 1999, Michael Jordan announced his retirement for the second time; he would come out of retirement for the second and final time in 2001 with the Washington Wizards and played two seasons with the team. However, neither season ended with a playoff appearance. Scottie Pippen was traded to the Houston Rockets during the offseason and played his last season (2003–04) with the Bulls and also played for the \nPortland Trail Blazers. Dennis Rodman, released by the Bulls in the offseason, signed with the Lakers mid-season, playing only 23 games before being released. In January 1999, the Bulls re-signed Steve Kerr and traded him to the San Antonio Spurs, where he would win two more championships in 1999 and 2003, his last year in the NBA. Kerr would go on to win four championships as head coach of the Golden State Warriors in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022. Luc Longley also retired in 2001.\nJohn Stockton and Karl Malone led the Jazz to playoff appearances each season through 2003, however each season featured a loss in the first or second round. During the 2003 off-season, Stockton retired and Malone joined the Los Angeles Lakers. Malone returned to the NBA Finals in 2004 where he would lose to the Detroit Pistons in 5 games."

        "title": "American football rules",
        "text": "Gameplay in American football consists of a series of \"downs\", individual plays of short duration, outside of which the ball is or is not in play. These can be plays from scrimmage – passes, runs, punts or field goal attempts (from either a place kick or a drop kick) – or free kicks such as kickoffs and fair catch kicks. Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal of specialization as coaches choose the players best suited for each particular situation. During a play, each team should have no more than 12 players on the field, and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific play.\nObjective of the game.\nThe objective of this game is to score more points than the other team during the allotted time. The team with the ball (the \"offense\") has 4 plays (\"downs\") to advance at least 10 yards, and can score points once they reach the opposite end of the field, which is home to a scoring zone called the \"end zone\", as well as the goalposts. If the offense succeeds in advancing at least 10 yards, they earn a \"first down\" and the number of tries allotted is reset and then they are again given 4 tries to advance an additional 10 yards, starting from the spot to which they last advanced. If the offense does not advance at least 10 yards during their 4 downs, the team without the ball (the \"defense\") regains control of the ball (called \"turnover on downs\").\nOn offense, points are scored by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone for a \"touchdown\" (worth six points), or by kicking the ball from the playing field through the raised vertical posts (the \"goalposts\") which are most commonly situated on the end line of the end zone for a \"field goal\" (worth three points). After scoring a touchdown, the offense is given an additional opportunity from the 2-yard line (3-yard line in amateur football) to attempt to score (in the NFL, 15-yard line on 1-point conversions). Conversion attempts are used to score 1 or 2 points as follows:\nWhile the opposing team has possession, the defense attempts to prevent the offense from advancing the ball and scoring. If an offensive player loses the ball during play (a \"fumble\") or the ball is caught by a defensive player while still in the air (an \"interception\"), the defense may attempt to run into the offense's end zone for a touchdown. The defense may also score points by tackling the ball carrier in the offense's own end zone, called a \"safety\" (which is worth two points).\nTime of play.\nCollegiate and professional football games are 1 hour long, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each. In high school football, 12 minute quarters are usually played. The clock is stopped frequently, however, with the result that a typical college or professional game can exceed three hours in duration. The referee controls the game clock and stops the clock after any incomplete pass or any play that ends out of bounds. In addition, each team is allowed 3 timeouts in each half that they may use at their own discretion. The clock normally runs during the action of plays, with a few exceptions known as untimed plays. Some high schools employ a mercy rule in which the clock runs continuously after one team's lead over the other achieves a certain number of points. In these instances, the clock only stops for injuries, or time outs called by a team or a referee.\nThe clock may also be stopped for an officials' time-out, after which, if the clock was running, it is restarted. For example: if there is a question whether or not a team has moved the ball far enough for a first down, the officials may use a measuring device (\"the chains\") to determine the distance. While this measurement is taking place, the officials will signal for a stoppage of the clock. Once the measurement is finished and the ball is placed at the proper location (\"spotted\"), the referee will then signal for the clock to restart. Additional situations where officials may take a time-out are to administer a penalty or for an injured player to be removed from the field.\nIn addition to the game clock, a separate \"play clock\" is also used. This counts down the time the offense has to start the next play before it is assessed a penalty for delay of game (see below). This clock is typically 25 seconds from when the referee marks the ball ready for play. The NFL and NCAA use a 40-second play clock that starts immediately after the previous play ends, though, for certain delays, such as penalty enforcement, the offense has 25 seconds from when the ball is marked ready. The purpose of the play clock is to ensure that the game progresses at a consistent pace, preventing unnecessary delays. Overall, clock management is a significant part of the game; teams leading toward the end of the game will often try to run out the clock via kneeldown while trailing teams attempt the opposite.\nOfficials also call for media time-outs, which allow time for television and radio advertising. They also stop the clock after a change of possession of the ball from one team to the other. Successful PATs (Point(s) After Touchdown), a field goal try, or a kickoff may also warrant stopping the clock. If an instant replay challenge is called during the game, the referees signal for a media time out. The referee signals these media time-outs by first using the time out signal, then extending both arms in a horizontal position.\nTeams change ends of the field at the end of the first quarter and the end of the third quarter, though otherwise, the situation on the field regarding possession, downs remaining and distance-to-goal does not change at these occasions (so a team with possession 5 yards from the opponent's endzone at the end of the first quarter would resume playing 5 yards from the endzone at the other end of the field, which they would then be attacking). Separating the first and second halves is \"halftime.\" Both halves, and any overtime, begin with kick-offs — the kicking team is decided by a coin toss (see below).\nIn the NFL, an automatic timeout is called by the officials once the ball is dead and there are two minutes or less left in both the second and the fourth quarters, and overtime; this is most commonly referred to as the \"two-minute warning.\" No such warning is normally given in amateur football, though if there is no visible stadium clock, the referee will give a two-minute warning (four minutes in high school).\nOvertime.\nNFL.\nIn the preseason, prior to and since , games that are tied at the end of four quarters end in a tie.\nIn the regular season and playoffs, if a game is tied at the end of four quarters, \"overtime\" is played. In overtime, a coin toss is used to determine which team will possess the ball first. The winner of the coin toss can choose to give the ball or receive the ball. In a regular season, if the first possession results in a touchdown (by the receiving team or by the defensive team on a turnover) or the defensive team scores a safety, the scoring team wins. If the receiving team fails to score and loses possession, the game goes into sudden death, and the first to score wins. However, if the initial receiving team only scores a field goal, the game is not automatically over and the other team is given an opportunity to possess the ball as well. The other team can win with a touchdown, tie with a field goal leading to sudden death or lose if they fail to score.\nIn a playoff, both teams will have the opportunity to possess the ball. If the score is tied after each team has possessed the ball, the next score wins. However, if the team kicking off to start the overtime scores a safety on the receiving team's initial possession, the team that kicked off is the winner.\nDuring the regular season in the NFL, one overtime period is played (with each team receiving two-time outs). If the game is still tied after the 10-minute overtime, the game officially ends in a tie. In the playoffs, overtime periods continue until a winner is determined. Overtime follows a three-minute intermission after the end of the regulation game. Prior to the start of overtime, a coin flip is performed in which the captain of the visiting team calls the toss. The team that wins the coin flip has the option either to receive the kickoff or choose the side of the field they wish to defend. Ties are rare in the NFL; the most recent being a game between the Washington Commanders and New York Giants on December 4, 2022, which ended in a 20–all tie. See List of NFL tied games for more games.\nRule changes.\nFrom the season, the overtime period was shortened from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for the preseason and regular season. The overtime for the postseason remains 15 minutes.\nPrior to the 2010–11 playoffs, the overtime winner was simply the first team to score any points; however, the rules were changed to reduce the advantage obtained by the team that won the overtime coin toss. Under the prior rules, the team that won the coin toss would usually elect to receive the ball, then gain just enough yardage to win the game by kicking a field goal without the other team ever touching the ball. The coin toss winner won approximately 60% of overtime games under that rule, rather than the 50% which would be expected by random chance.\nThe first overtime game played under a trial of the new overtime rules occurred in a between the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado. Denver won the game on the first play in overtime, an 80-yard touchdown pass from Tim Tebow to Demaryius Thomas. The rule was formally adopted for the 2012 season, and the first game in which both teams scored in overtime was a 43–37 victory by the Houston Texans over the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 18, 2012.\nThe rules for overtime changed for the 2016–2017 season and were tweaked again for the 2017–2018 season. The NFL's overtime rules are still subject to criticism, as a team that loses the coin toss and goes on to concede the touchdown does not get a chance for their offense to take the field.\nSuper Bowl LI was the first Super Bowl to go into overtime with a 28-all tie between the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots, which the Patriots eventually won with James White scoring a touchdown on the Patriots' first drive.\nThe 2019 NFC and AFC championship games both went to overtime, the first time for such an occurrence. In the NFC title game, the New Orleans Saints won the coin toss but an interception allowed the Los Angeles Rams to drive into range to kick the winning field goal. In the AFC Championship held later that day, the New England Patriots won the coin toss and on their first drive scored the winning touchdown over the Kansas City Chiefs.\nNFL Europa.\nNFL Europa, a defunct league run by the NFL, used a 10-minute overtime period, with the constraint that each team must have the opportunity of possession; once both teams have had such an opportunity, the overtime proceeds in a manner similar to the NFL's. Thus, if Team A has the first possession of overtime and scores a touchdown and converts their kick (thus being 7 points ahead of Team B), Team A would then kick off to Team B (In the NFL, the game would have ended with the touchdown, without a conversion being attempted). Team B would have to match or exceed the 7 point difference within this ensuing possession; exceeding it would end the game immediately while matching the difference would result in a kickoff to Team A. From this point, the overtime is sudden death. The defunct United Football League had also used this rule.\nWorld Football League.\nThe defunct World Football League, in its first season of 1974, used an overtime system more analogous to the system long used in international soccer. The overtime consisted of one 15-minute period, which was played in its entirety and divided into two halves of 7½ minutes each, with each half starting with a kickoff by one of the teams. The league changed to the NFL's sudden-death format for its final season in 1975.\nCollege and high school.\nIn college and high school football, an overtime procedure (the \"Kansas plan\") ensures that each team has equal opportunity to score. In college, both teams are granted possession of the ball at their opponents' 25 yard-line in succession; the procedure repeats for next possession if needed; all possessions thereafter will be from the opponent's 3-yard line. A coin flip takes place, with the winning team having the option either 1) to declare that they will take the ball first or second, or 2) to decide on which end of the field the series will occur (both teams' series occur on the same end of the field). The losing team will have the first option in any subsequent even-numbered overtime. In the first overtime, the team with the first series attempts to score either a touchdown or a field goal; their possession ends when either a touchdown or a field goal have been scored, they turn the ball over via a fumble or an interception, or they fail to gain a first down. After a touchdown, a team may attempt either an extra-point or a two-point conversion. However, if the team on defense during the first series recovers a fumble and returns it for a touchdown, or returns an interception for a touchdown, the defensive team wins the game. (This is the only way for a college overtime game to end without both teams having possession.) Otherwise, regardless of the outcome of the first team's series (be it a touchdown, field goal, or turnover), the other team begins their series. If the score remains tied after both teams have completed a series, the procedure is repeated, but if a touchdown is scored, a two-point conversion will be required. Since 2021, if the game is still tied after double overtime, each team attempts one 2-point conversion per period rather than getting the ball at the 25-yard line.\nIn high school football, individual state associations can choose any overtime format they want, or even elect to not play overtime at all (ties stand in this case). However, most states use the Kansas Plan. In a majority of states, each team is granted possession of the ball at the 10-yard line, meaning that a team cannot make a first down without scoring except via a defensive penalty that carries an automatic first down (such as defensive pass interference or roughing the passer). As is the case with the college overtime rule, the team that wins the coin toss will have the choice as to whether to take the ball first or second, or decide at which end of the field the overtime will be played. The other major difference between overtime in college football and high school football is that in some states, if the defense forces a turnover, the ball is dead immediately, thus eliminating the possibility of scoring. However, in Texas, the college overtime rule is used, as both the University Interscholastic League, which governs interscholastic activities for Texas public high schools, and the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, the largest analogous body for Texas private high schools, play by NCAA football rules with a few modifications for the high school level.\nXFL.\nThe original incarnation of the XFL used a modified Kansas Plan which, upon the first team scoring, required the opponent to score the same or greater number of points in the same or fewer downs (i.e., if the first team scored a touchdown, and converted the one-point conversion in three downs, the opponent would have to match that touchdown and conversion in three downs as well). Each team started at the 20-yard line, but like high school, there were no opportunities for first downs. The league also banned field goals except on a fourth down.\nThe XFL's current incarnation uses a five-round shootout of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the NCAA adopted a similar concept for games that reach quintuple overtime starting with the 2019 FBS season, two seasons later, triple overtime. The defense is not able to score, as should a turnover occur, the play would be dead. Defensive penalties result in the ball moving up to the 1-yard line, while a second defensive penalty on any play, even in future rounds, results in a score awarded to the offensive team. To speed up the overtime process, both teams' offense and defense are on the field at the appropriate end zone. Once one team's offense has completed its round of the shootout, the other team's offense plays its round from the opposite end zone. These overtime rules ensure that both teams have an opportunity to win the game and would limit overtime to 5 or 6 minutes. If both teams remain tied after five rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw.\nUSFL (2022).\nThe United States Football League settles ties this way: teams get three (at least two) rounds of two-point conversions from the three-yard line. Coin toss is called by the visiting team; winner of the toss can choose to possess the ball first or defend. Whoever scores more points in the three rounds wins it; otherwise, teams play sudden-death rounds until one team scores. One timeout can be called per overtime round. Although no game clock is used, the play clock of 35 seconds is still used.\nPlaying the game.\nCoin toss.\nThree minutes before the start of the game, the referee meets with captains from both teams for a coin toss. The visiting team calls the toss before the coin is flipped, since 1998. The winner of the toss may defer their choice to the start of the second half, or they may take the first choice of:\nThe loser of the toss gets the remaining option. Typically, if the winner of the toss defers, the loser will choose to receive the ball first.\nAt the start of the second half, the team that did not choose first (either because they deferred their choice or because they lost the toss) gets the first choice of options.\nAccording to \"USA Today\", in college games, the team that wins the toss defers their choice to the start of the second half over 90% of the time.\nIf a game goes to overtime, a coin toss is held before the start of overtime, but tosses are not held before the start of subsequent overtime periods. In college, for example, the loser of the toss to start overtime has the first choice in the second overtime period. The choices available to the captains in overtime vary among the NFL, college, and various states' high school rules.\nIn high school, the coin toss may be held between the captains or coaches earlier before the start of the game. At three minutes before kickoff, the captains meet for a simulated coin toss, where the referee announces the results of the earlier toss.\nXFL.\nThe original incarnation of the XFL did not implement a coin toss; instead, an event took place called the \"opening scramble\", in which one player from each team fought to recover a football 20 yards away to determine possession. Both players lined up side-by-side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues).\nThe XFL's current incarnation also does not feature coin tosses. Instead, the home team is given the option to kick off, receive, select a goal, or defer to the second half. In the event of overtime, the visiting team is given the choice of going first or second or selecting which end zone to attack (with the home team getting the other choice).\nDowned player.\nThe rules vary from the college level to the professional level. In the NFL, unless a player is tagged by an opposing player or gives himself up, he is not down. A player carrying the ball (the runner) is downed when any of the following occurs:\nScrimmage downs.\nThe majority of a football game takes place on plays, or \"downs\", that begin at the line of scrimmage. The officials \"spot\" the ball (place it in a designated spot on the field) on the line of scrimmage and declare it ready for play.\nPositions.\nThe width of the spotted football defines the width of the neutral zone, an area of the field no player other than the snapper may position himself in or above before the snap. Each team has its own line of scrimmage, thought of as a vertical plane from sideline to sideline that passes through the point of the ball nearest its own goal line.\nA typical offense is made up of a quarterback, five offensive linemen, two wide receivers, a running back, a fullback, and a tight end, however teams will vary their personnel on the field to fit any given play. A quarterback is essentially the leader of the offense. It is most often their responsibility to pass along the play called to the rest of the players in the huddle before any given play. A quarterback is the primary ball-handler on offense. It is their responsibility to call the snap count for the ball to enter play. Once the ball is hiked into play, it is their job to either hand the ball off to one of their running backs, or scout the field for an open receiver to throw the ball to. In some instances, the quarterback will run the ball themselves. A quarterback is guarded by their offensive linemen. The offensive line is made up of a left and right tackle, a left and right guard, and a center. It is the center's responsibility to hike the ball to the quarterback. An offensive line has two different jobs. When the offense runs a pass play, it is their job to guard the quarterback from the defense that is rushing. When the offense runs a run play, it is their job to clear a path for the running back to run through. The running back also has multiple roles. They will either take the ball from the quarterback and run, move up and help the offensive line block or go out and catch a pass. While the role of the fullback is deteriorating currently among professional leagues, it is their primary responsibility to lead the running back. Running backs and fullbacks are sometimes also called a halfback, a wingback, or a slotback. Like the running back, the tight end also has multiple roles. They will either help the offensive line protect the quarterback, block on run plays, or run or catch the ball themselves. The wide receivers' primary role is to run out into the field of play and catch the ball, although they will also block in some instances.\nThe players on offense must arrange themselves in a formation, all behind their line of scrimmage (that is, on their side of the ball). For reasons of safety and competitive balance, there are strict rules which define the way in which the offensive players may line up. Seven players must line up directly on the line of scrimmage while four players line up behind the line of scrimmage. Within this formation, there are six eligible receivers who may receive a forward pass during play. These eligible receivers are either the running back, fullback, tight end, or wide receivers. The remaining five linemen, often called \"interior linemen\" do not normally handle the ball during a play. Because of these rules, various leagues of American football have enacted strict rules of uniform numbering so officials may more easily judge which players were eligible and which were not at the start of a play. For example, in college football, ineligible players wear numbers 50–79, while eligible receivers wear 1–49 or 80–99. Even within this structure, offenses can still present a wide number of formations, so long as they maintain the \"seven and four\" arrangement. Receivers, for example, may play close to the other linemen or they may play some distance down the line of scrimmage, where they would sometimes be called split ends. Of the four backs, they may play behind the linemen or may play \"split out\" to provide additional wide receivers. These additional receivers can be flankers (if they play split far wide, but still in the backfield) or slot receivers if they play in the \"slot\" between the split end and the rest of the offensive line.\nThe players on defense may arrange themselves in any manner, as long as all players are \"behind the line\" (that is, on the side of the line nearest their own end zone). Players who line up opposite the offensive line are called defensive linemen, usually with one or two defensive tackles in the middle (a single defensive tackle is often called the nose guard or nose tackle) and with one defensive end on each side. A defensive lineman's job is typically to put pressure on the opposing team's quarterback by rushing the offensive line. The defensive line is also most often the first set of players the opponent must get through should they choose to run the ball. Behind the linemen are the linebackers. A linebacker's job can be any number of things, including trying to rush the opposing team's quarterback, stopping the opponents running back on run plays, or covering the opponent's tight end or wide receivers. Positioned opposite the wide receivers are the cornerbacks. Their primary responsibility is to cover the wide receivers. Farthest back from the line are the safeties, usually in the middle of the field behind the linebackers. The safeties are the last line of defense against the opponent. Like a linebacker, a safety's role can vary, however, their most common role is to help the cornerbacks cover the opponent's wide receivers, which is called \"double coverage\". The linemen and linebackers close to the line of scrimmage, are often referred to as playing \"in the box\". Players outside \"the box\" (usually cornerbacks and safeties) are collectively referred to as the \"secondary\".\nStarting the down.\nA scrimmage down begins with a \"snap\", where the center throws or hands the ball back to one of the backs, usually the quarterback. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball, or runs with it himself. The down ends when the ball becomes dead (see below). The ball is typically next spotted where the ball became dead; however, if it became dead outside the hash marks, it is brought in on the same yard line to the nearest hash mark. This spot establishes the lines of scrimmage for the next play. In the case of an incomplete forward pass, the ball is returned to the spot where it was last snapped to begin the next play. A fumbled ball that goes out of bounds is declared dead and possession remains with the team that most recently had control of the ball.\nDead ball.\nThe ball becomes dead, and the down ends, when:\nThe nearest official typically blows his whistle after the ball becomes dead to alert the players that the down has already ended. If the ball is alive and the official sounds an \"inadvertent whistle\", then the ball still becomes dead, but the team in possession of the ball may elect to have the down replayed or take the spot where the ball was declared dead. If the ball was loose from a fumble, then the ball can be put into play at the spot of the fumble. If the ball was in flight from a kick or a pass, then the down is always replayed.\nFree kick downs.\nA free kick is a down that does not occur from scrimmage. The kicking team begins behind the ball, while the receiving team must remain at least 10 yards downfield before the ball is kicked.\nKickoffs.\nA kickoff is a type of free kick where the ball is placed on a tee (or held) at the kicking team's 35-yard line (40 for high school). In the 2011 NFL Season, changes were made regarding kickoffs to limit injuries. The spot from which the ball is kicked was restored to the 35 yard line, bringing to an end the 1994 designation of the 30 yard line, a change meant to increase the frequency of the option to elect a touchback. In addition, players on the kickoff coverage team (apart from the kicker) cannot line up more than a specified distance behind the kickoff line. This distance is 5 yards at most levels of the game and 1 yard in the NFL, minimizing running starts and thus reducing the speed of collisions. The kicking team's players may not cross this line until the ball is kicked; members of the non-kicking (or \"receiving\") team are similarly restrained behind a line 10 yards further downfield (the 45-yard line, or 50 for high school). A valid kickoff must travel at least this 10-yard distance to the receiving team's restraining line, after which any player of either team may catch or pick up the ball and try to advance it (a member of the kicking team may only recover a kickoff and may not advance it) before being downed (see \"Downed player,\" below). In most cases, the ball is kicked as far as possible (typically 40 to 70 yards), after which a player of the receiving team is usually able to secure possession (since the members of the kicking team cannot start downfield until after the ball is kicked). Occasionally, for tactical reasons, the kicking team may instead choose to attempt an onside kick, in which the kicker tries to kick the ball along the ground just over the required 10-yard distance in such a manner that one of his own teammates can recover the ball for the kicking side. If it is touched before ten yards, the ball is dead and a re-kick or spot of the ball will be rewarded to the receiving team.\nReceiving a kickoff.\nA member of the receiving team gaining possession of the ball on a kickoff may attempt to advance it as far as he can toward the kicking team's goal line before being downed. Once the ball carrier is downed, the play is whistled dead and the ball is placed by the officials at the point where the play ended; this spot then becomes the line of scrimmage for the ensuing play. A kick that travels through or goes out of bounds within the end zone without being touched, or is caught by the receiving team in the end zone but not advanced out of it, results in a touchback; the ball is then placed at the receiving team's 25-yard line, which becomes the line of scrimmage. In college football only, a fair catch by the receiving team between its own 25-yard line and the goal line is treated as a touchback, with the ball placed at the 25.\nA kickoff that goes out of bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is an illegal kick: the receiving team has the option of having the ball re-kicked from five yards closer to the kicking team's goal line, or they may choose to take possession of the ball at the point where it went out of bounds or 30 yards from the point of the kick (25 yards in high school, and in college ), whichever is more advantageous.\nOther free kicks.\nA free-kick is also used to restart the game following a safety. The team that was trapped in its own end zone, therefore conceding two points to the other team, kicks the ball from its own 20-yard line. This can be a place kick (in the NFL, a tee cannot be used), drop-kick, or punt.\nIn the NFL and high school, a free kick may be taken on the play immediately after a fair catch; see \"fair catch kick\" below.\nScoring.\nScrimmage plays and kickoffs.\nMost standard football plays are considered scrimmage plays, initiated from a line of scrimmage. Exceptions are kickoffs and try plays (below). Although similar rules apply during a try play, the number of points awarded for each score differs on a try play.\nTouchdown (6 points).\nA touchdown is earned when a player has legal possession of the ball and the ball touches or goes over the imaginary vertical plane above the opposing team's goal line. After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a try play for 1 or 2 points (see below). A successful touchdown is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head. A touchdown is worth six points, except in the defunct WFL where it was worth seven points.\nFor statistical purposes, the player who advances the ball into or catches it in the end zone is credited with the touchdown. If a forward pass was thrown on the play, the throwing player is credited with a passing touchdown.\nField goal (3 points).\nA field goal is scored when the ball is place kicked, drop kicked, or free kicked after a fair catch or awarded fair catch (High School or NFL only) between the goalposts behind the opponent's end zone. The most common type of kick used is the place kick. For a place kick, the ball must first be snapped to a placeholder, who holds the ball upright on the ground with his fingertip so that it may be kicked. Three points are scored if the ball crosses between the two upright posts and above the crossbar and remains over. If a field goal is missed, the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage (in the NFL, to the spot of the kick; in high school, to the 20-yard line if the ball enters the end zone, or otherwise where the ball becomes dead after the kick) or to the 20-yard line if that is further from the goal line, and possession is given to the other team. If the ball does not go out of bounds, the other team may catch the kicked ball and attempt to advance it, but this is usually not advantageous. One official is positioned under each goalpost; if either one rules the field goal no good, then the field goal is unsuccessful. A successful field goal is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head. A team that successfully kicks a field goal kicks off to the opposing team on the next play.\nSafety (2 points).\nThe uncommon safety is scored if a player causes the ball to become dead in his own end zone; two points are awarded to the opposing (usually defending) team. This can happen if a player is either downed or goes out of bounds in the end zone while carrying the ball, or if he fumbles the ball, and it goes out of bounds in the end zone. Safety is also awarded to the defensive team if the offensive team commits a foul which is enforced in its own end zone. A safety is \"not\" awarded if a player intercepts a pass or receives a kick in his own end zone and is downed there. This situation, in which the opponent caused the ball to enter the end zone, is called a touchback; no points are scored, and the team that gained possession of the ball is awarded possession at its own 25-yard line. If the interception or reception occurs outside the end zone, and the player is carried into the end zone by momentum, the ball is placed at the spot of the catch, and no safety is awarded. A safety is signaled by a referee holding both palms together above the head, fingertips pointing upwards. After a safety, the team that conceded the safety kicks a free kick (which may be a punt, place kick, or drop-kick) from its 20-yard line.\nTry plays.\nA try play (as opposed to a regular scrimmage play or kickoff), more commonly referred to as an extra-point attempt, PAT (abbreviation of \"point after touchdown\"), conversion attempt, or two-point conversion attempt, based on the scoring team's intentions on the play, is awarded to the scoring team immediately following a touchdown. This un-timed down is an opportunity to score additional points.\nExtra point (field goal - 1 point).\nThe offensive team may attempt to kick the ball through the goalposts, in the same manner, that a field goal is kicked during a scrimmage play. In the NFL, the ball is spotted at the 15-yard line. In college and high school, the ball is spotted at the 3-yard line. If successful, the team is awarded 1 point, referred to as an extra point. This option is almost always chosen because a two-point conversion attempt is much riskier. Since the extra point is almost always successful, sportscasters will often refer to a team-up or trailing by seven (not six) points as being \"up/trailing by a touchdown\".\nTwo-point conversion (touchdown - 2 points).\nThe offensive team may attempt to advance the ball via run or pass into the end zone, much like a touchdown on the extra-point attempt, except that it receives two points. This is called a two-point conversion. If the offense elects to attempt a two-point conversion on the try play, the ball is spotted at the 2-yard line in the NFL and on the 3-yard line for college and high school. The success rate for two-point conversions is about 48 percent in the NFL, making the two-point conversion attempt a risky tactic; thus it is usually attempted only when two points will help the team but one point will not.\nDefensive conversion.\nUnder college, NFL &amp; USFL rules, if the defensive team gains possession and advances the ball the length of the field into the opposite end zone on the try play (via interception or a fumble recovery, or by blocking a kick and legally recovering the ball), they score two points. This is officially recorded as a defensive conversion scored by the defense. The NCAA adopted this rule in 1988; the NFL added this in 2015; the USFL, 2022.\nSafety (1 point).\nA safety scored on a try play is worth one point. This can occur when, for example, the defense gains control of the ball and advances it into the field of play, but then retreats into its own end zone when play is stopped. Similarly, the defense could recover a fumble in its own end zone before play is stopped. A safety on a try play could also be awarded to the defense if the defense takes possession of the ball during a try play, advances it all the way down to the opposite end of the field, where the offensive team then regains possession before the play is declared dead in that end zone.\nThe one point safety is the most rare type of score in American football. And has never occurred in NFL play, and has only occurred three times in NCAA division 1 football.\nSince a one-point cannot occur unless the other team at least scores a touchdown a final score of 0–1 to 5-1 is not possible in American football, though a final score of 6-1 or 8-1 or higher is.\nOfficials signals on try plays.\nThe officials' signal for a successful try, whether an extra point or a two-point conversion, is the same as for a touchdown. The officials' signal for a safety on a try play is also the same as on a scrimmage play.\nAfter the try, the team that scored the touchdown kicks off to the opposing team. Unlike a safety that occurs on a scrimmage play, no free-kick is awarded following a safety on a try play.\nTry play rules in overtime.\nDuring sudden-death over time, particularly in the NFL, if a team scores a touchdown in the overtime period, the game is immediately over, and the try is ignored.\nIn NCAA overtime, if the second team to possess the ball in the overtime scores a touchdown which puts them ahead of the opponent in points, the game is immediately over, and the try is ignored.\nFair catch kick.\nA free-kick (see above) may be taken on the play immediately after any fair catch of a punt. In the NFL, if the receiving team elects to attempt this and time expired during the punt, the half/overtime is extended with an untimed down. The ball must be held on the ground by a member of the kicking team or drop kicked; a tee may not be used. (High school kickers may use a tee). This is both a field goal attempt and a free-kick; if the ball is kicked between the goalposts, three points are scored for the kicking team. This is the only case where a free kick may score points. This method of scoring is extremely rare, last successfully completed in the NFL by Ray Wersching in 1976. It is only advantageous when a team catches a very short punt with very little time left. A team is unlikely to be punting with only a few seconds left in a half or overtime, and it is rarer still for punts to be caught near field goal range. The officials' signal for a successful fair catch kick is the same as for a field goal.\nOfficiating.\nThe game is officiated by a crew of three to seven officials. Every crew will consist of a \"referee\", who is generally in charge of the game and watches the action on the quarterback and in the offensive backfield; an \"umpire\", who handles spotting the ball and watches the action on the offensive line; and a \"head linesman\", who supervises the placement of the down box and line-to-gain chains. The crew may also consist of a \"line judge\", \"back judge\", \"field judge\" and \"side judge\", in the order listed: i.e. a crew of five officials have a referee, umpire, head linesman, line judge, and back judge.\nOfficials are selected by the teams in advance or appointed by the governing league. While the majority of officials at lower levels only officiate games on a part-time basis, the NFL is implementing a new system where seven officials will become full-time employees of the league, one for each official position (i.e. back judge, field judge, side judge, etc.). In the other three major North American professional sports leagues – Major League Baseball, the NBA and NHL – officials are employed by their respective leagues. The sheer volume of games in the other three sports necessitates full-time officials; since 2021, the NFL regular season is only 17 games long, compared to 162 games for MLB and 82 for the NBA and NHL.\nDuring the game, the officials are assisted in the administration of the game by other persons, including a \"clock operator\" to start and stop the game clock (and possibly also the play clock); a chain crew who hold the \" down indicator\" and the \"line-to-gain chains\" on the sideline; and \"ball boys\", who provide footballs to officials between downs (e.g. a dry ball each down on a wet day). These individuals may be provided by the teams involved – it is common for a high school coach's son or daughter to act as a ball boy for the team.\nFouls and their penalties.\nBecause football is a high-contact sport requiring a balance between offense and defense, many rules exist that regulate equality, safety, contact, and actions of players on each team. It is very difficult to always avoid violating these rules without giving up too much of an advantage. Thus, an elaborate system of fouls and penalties has been developed to \"let the punishment fit the crime\" and maintain a balance between following the rules and keeping a good flow of the game. Players are constantly looking for ways to find an advantage that stretches the limitations imposed by the rules. Also, the frequency and severity of fouls can make a large difference in the outcome of a game, so coaches are constantly looking for ways to minimize the number and severity of infractions committed by their players.\nIt is a common misconception that the term \"penalty\" is used to refer both to an infraction and the penal consequence of that infraction. A \"foul\" is a rule infraction for which a penalty is prescribed. Some of the more common fouls are listed below. In most cases when a foul occurs, the offending team will be assessed a penalty of 5, 10, or 15 yards, depending on the foul. Also, in most cases, if the foul is committed while the ball is in play, the down will be replayed from the new position (for example, if the offense commits a foul on a first-down play, the next play will still be first down, but the offense may have to go 15 yards, or farther, to achieve another first down.) But if a defensive foul results in the ball advancing beyond the offense's first-down objective, the next play will be the first down of a new series. Some penalties (typically for more serious fouls), however, require a loss of down for the offense; and some defensive fouls may result in an automatic first down regardless of the ball position.\nIn all cases (except for ejection of a player or, in rare cases, forfeiture of the game), the non-offending team is given the option of declining the penalty and letting the result of the play stand (although the Referee may exercise this option on their behalf when it is obvious), if they believe it to be more to their advantage. For some fouls by the defense, the penalty is applied in addition to the yardage gained on the play. Most personal fouls, which involve danger to another player, carry 15-yard penalties; in rare cases, they result in offending players being ejected from the game. In the NFL, if a defensive foul occurs after time has expired at the end of a half, the half will be continued for a single, untimed play from scrimmage. Under college rules, any accepted penalty when the time has expired at the end of any quarter results in an extension for one untimed down.\nIn the NFL, with three exceptions, no penalty may move the ball more than half the distance toward the penalized team's goal line. These exceptions are defensive pass interference (see the discussion of that foul for more details), intentional grounding, and offensive holding – but in this last case, the exception pertains only if the infraction occurs within the offensive team's own end zone, in which case an automatic safety is assessed (intentional grounding from the end zone also carries an automatic safety). Under college rules, the same half-the-distance principle applies, but any offensive fouls involving contact in their end zone (e.g. holding, illegal blocking or personal fouls) result in a safety.\nTimeouts.\nEach team receives three timeouts per half (if the game goes to overtime, each team receives additional timeouts), making for a total of six timeouts per team in a regulation game. Unused timeouts may not carry over to the second half or overtime. In professional football, a team must have at least one remaining timeout to challenge an official's call.\nInstant replay.\nIn the NFL, a number of rulings can be reviewed by officials or challenged by coaches. If a coach wants to challenge a play, he must do so before the next play begins, and he does so by throwing a red flag similar to the officials' yellow flags. Coaches are allowed two challenges per game and are granted a third if their first two are successful. The team loses a timeout if they lose the challenge. Therefore, they cannot challenge if they do not have timeouts. Plays within the two-minute-warning and overtime cannot be challenged; any review must be initiated by a replay official off-field. The referee performs the actual review via a video screen on the sideline. The referee will announce the result of instant replay reviews over his wireless microphone.\nBeginning in the 2011 NFL Season, an instant replay review by the booth official will now be automatic for every play ruled by the referees on the field to have scored points. This is seen as another step in the \"modernization\" of sports. Every scoring play will be reviewed now, which saves coaches from using up their challenges on close plays in the endzone. And since the 2012 season, the booth official also reviews all turnovers during the game.\nIn college, coaches are allowed one challenge per game by first requesting a timeout. Otherwise, a replay official in the press box observes all plays. If he deems a ruling may be in error, he notifies the officials on the field to interrupt the game before the beginning of the next play. The replay official performs the review and relays the decision to the referee, who announces the result. Not every conference employs replay, which is optional.\nHigh school rules generally do not provide for a video review of any decisions by officials during a game. By state adoption, replay may be used in a state championship game. At all times, the use of television or videotape for coaching purposes during the game is prohibited. If a coach feels a rule has been misinterpreted, he may call a timeout and request a coach-referee conference to \"discuss\" the ruling with the referee, but no replay equipment will be consulted during the conference.\nMajor rule differences between NFL and college football.\nSome of the major rule differences between NFL and college football include:"

        "title": "Melbourne Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) is a sports club based in Melbourne, Australia. It was founded in 1838 and is one of the oldest sports clubs in Australia.\nThe MCC is responsible for management and development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a power given to it by the government-appointed MCG Trust and an Act of Parliament. This also guarantees the club's occupation of about 20 per cent of the stadium for its members reserve.\nIn 1859, members drafted the first set of rules for Australian rules football. In 1877, it hosted the first game of Test cricket in history—played between Australia and England. In 1971, the ground hosted the first One Day International cricket match.\nAs well as cricket, the MCC is also an umbrella organisation for other sports, such as Australian rules football, baseball (through the Melbourne Baseball Club), bowls, croquet, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, netball, target shooting, squash, real tennis and tennis.\nSince 2009 the Melbourne Football Club has been the football division of the club having previously been part of the club from 1889 to 1980. There also exists a women's team competing in the Victorian Amateur Football Association, called the MCC Football Club. \nHistory.\nOn 17 November 1838, the first MCC cricket match occurred at the site of the Royal Mint.\nAt the same time five men met and formed the Melbourne Cricket Club; they were Frederick Powlett, Robert Russell, George B. Smyth and brothers Alfred and Charles Mundy. Three of the five, Powlett, Smyth and Alfred Mundy were neighbouring pastoralists at Kilmore. In 1839 the MCC began playing cricket matches near the current site of Southern Cross railway station. Powlett was elected inaugural President in 1841.\nMembership.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club is the largest sporting club in Australia. As of August 2015 there were 104,000 members of the club, of which 62,700 were \"full members\" and 41,300 were \"restricted members\", with 242,000 people registered on the waiting list. That same year, a new category below Restricted Membership was created called Provisional Membership, which \"is designed to prevent the already lengthy wait for membership of our club from extending to 40 years or more in generations to come.\" Provisional members \"have fewer benefits and less access to the Reserve than Full and Restricted members.\" As of 31 January 2018, the waiting list \"consist[s] of candidates nominated from 1 October 2000 to today.\"\nFull membership entitles members to entry to the Members' Reserve at the MCG for all cricket and football matches and most special sporting events. Full members also have a number of added benefits, which include reciprocal rights at clubs and stadiums around Australia and overseas as well as the opportunity to attend numerous club functions exclusive to MCC members. Restricted members also have access to events, with the exception of the AFL Grand Final. Full members, but not restricted members, are also permitted to nominate candidates for the waiting list and to vote on club affairs.\nReciprocal clubs.\nMembers of the MCC are able to access the members' area of reciprocal clubs, typically while on a short visit to the area. These benefits, with the exclusion of the VRC and Docklands Stadium, are reserved for full members. These clubs include:\nAlso other overseas grounds, including the Singapore and Hong Kong Cricket Clubs, the Cricket Club of India and the Marylebone Cricket Club (Lord's).\nCricket team.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club has been active in club cricket in Victoria since its inception. The club was one of the strongest in pennant cricket during the pre-district era (1889-90 to 1905-06). When district cricket commenced in 1906-07, the club initially opted out; and while it continued to play club matches, it was not eligible for the district pennant. The club agreed to join the district scheme starting from the 1914-15 season, under special rules whereby it could draw players from any district but with a limit on how many could be drawn from any single other club's district.\nThe MCC plays its First XI matches at the Albert Cricket Ground. It has been the most successful club in Victorian District/Premier Cricket, and as of 2022-23 has won an association-high 22 First XI two-day premierships:&lt;BR&gt;\nFirst XI Two-Day (22): 1914-15, 1919-20, 1929-30, 1932-33, 1934-35, 1935-36, 1936-37, 1937-38, 1948-49, 1951-52, 1958-59, 1972-73, 1975-76, 1981-82, 1988-89, 1992-93, 1994-95, 1997-98, 2009-10, 2012-13, 2019-20, 2022-23&lt;BR&gt;\nFirst XI One-Day/White Ball (3): 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14&lt;BR&gt;\nFirst XI Twenty20 (2): 2007-08, 2012-13\nOn 1 December 1999, the MCC announced its cricket team of the century, with all players who had played at least one season for the club since 1906-07 being eligible for selection. The team as selected was:\nAll members of the team of the century except Robert Templeton had played at least one Test match for the Australian cricket team."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLIV",
        "text": "Super Bowl XLIV was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champions New Orleans Saints and the American Football Conference (AFC) champions Indianapolis Colts to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2009 season. The underdog Saints defeated the Colts by a score of 31–17, earning the franchise its first Super Bowl win. The game was played at Sun Life Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) in Miami Gardens, Florida, for the fifth time (and in South Florida for the tenth time), on February 7, 2010, which was the latest calendar date for a Super Bowl until Super Bowl LVI in 2022.\nThis was the Saints' first Super Bowl appearance and the fourth for the Colts franchise, and their first since Super Bowl XLI in 2007. The Saints entered the game with a 13–3 record for the 2009 regular season, compared to the Colts' 14–2 record. In the playoff games, both teams placed first in their conferences, marking the first time since Super Bowl XXVIII (16 years previously) that both number-one seeds have reached the Super Bowl. The Colts entered the Super Bowl off victories over the Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets, while the Saints advanced after defeating the previous year's runners up, the Arizona Cardinals, and then overcoming the Minnesota Vikings in the Conference Championship. It was also the first time both teams started with a 13-game winning streak. This game would also mark the last Super Bowl appearance for both the Colts and Saints as of the upcoming 2024 NFL season.\nNew Orleans was behind 10–6 at halftime of Super Bowl XLIV. During a play many consider the turning point of the game, Thomas Morstead kicked off the second half with a surprise onside kick. The Saints recovered the kick and soon got their first lead of the game with Pierre Thomas's 16-yard touchdown reception. The Colts responded with Joseph Addai's 4-yard touchdown run to regain the lead at 17–13. The Saints then scored 18 unanswered points, including Tracy Porter's 74-yard interception return for a touchdown, to clinch the victory. New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees, who completed 32 of 39 passes for 288 yards and two touchdowns, was named the Super Bowl MVP. His 32 completions tied a Super Bowl record set by Tom Brady in Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Saints' win was seen as a major morale boost for the city of New Orleans following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. However, the game would later become controversial by the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, when the NFL determined in 2012 that the Saints operated a slush fund between the 2009 and 2011 seasons to pay out bounties to their players for injuring their opponents.\nThe live broadcast of the game on CBS was watched by an average U.S. audience of 106.5 million viewers, making it then the most-watched Super Bowl. The National Anthem was sung by American Idol season 4 winner Carrie Underwood, and the halftime show featured the British rock band The Who. Super Bowl XLIV was the last Super Bowl to have a uniquely designed logo as its predecessors had: starting with Super Bowl XLV, the logo was permanently settled to bear the Vince Lombardi Trophy and the Roman numerals denoting the edition of the game. This is also the earliest Super Bowl in which neither team has since re-appeared as of 2023.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nThe league initially voted on March 23, 2005, that New York City host the game, contingent on the completion of the proposed West Side Stadium being built for the New York Jets by 2008. After New York state government officials declined to approve $400 million for the stadium, the NFL decided to reopen the bidding for the game's site. The league reconsidered the other, unsuccessful candidates for Super Bowl XLIII: Atlanta, Houston, and Miami. On October 6, 2006, the league selected Miami as the host city, with the formerly-named-Joe Robbie Stadium as the venue.\nThis was the tenth time the Super Bowl has been held in the Miami Metro area at the home stadium of the Miami Dolphins: the formerly-named Joe Robbie Stadium had hosted four previous Super Bowls (XXIII, XXIX, XXXIII, and XLI) and five were played in the Dolphins' now demolished former home, the Miami Orange Bowl (II, III, V, X, XIII). The Colts franchise was playing its fourth Super Bowl, all of which were played in Miami (two at the Orange Bowl and two at then-named Sun Life Stadium). They are the only franchise to play all of its Super Bowls in the same city and the second to play two or more Super Bowls in two different stadiums (joining the Broncos who played two at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego and two at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, and the Patriots who played Super Bowls in three stadiums twice – Reliant/NRG Stadium in Houston, University of Phoenix/State Farm Stadium in Glendale, and the Louisiana Superdome).\nWith Tampa as the host of Super Bowl XLIII, Super Bowl XLIV also marked the third time that consecutive Super Bowls have been played in the same state. Super Bowls II and III were both played at the Orange Bowl. Super Bowls XXI and XXII were both played in California: XXI at Pasadena's Rose Bowl Stadium and XXII at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium.\nMiami became the first city to host two Super Bowls designated as a National Special Security Event (NSSE). In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, every Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI has been designated as an NSSE. Super Bowl XLI was Miami's first Super Bowl designated as an NSSE.\nPro Bowl changes.\nThe 2010 Pro Bowl was played on January 31, during the off-week between the conference championships and the Super Bowl, breaking with the precedent of scheduling the game for the Sunday after the Super Bowl. The game also changed venues from Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii, where it had been held since 1979, to Sun Life Stadium in Miami (the same city and stadium hosting the Super Bowl itself). Fourteen players from the Super Bowl participants, seven from each team, had been selected but were unable to participate due to the change. The new schedule took advantage of the bye week given to the conference champions to rest and prepare for the Super Bowl. The Pro Bowl returned to Honolulu the following season and remained there until 2015, when it was played in Glendale, Arizona, a week before Super Bowl XLIX, also in Glendale. The game returned to Honolulu in 2016, and beginning in 2017 was played in Orlando permanently. This, however, changed again in 2020, when the league announced that the 2021 Pro Bowl would be played at the new Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.\nThe move also meant that the Pro Bowl, which was won by the AFC by a score of 41–34, would avoid competing against the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, the second full day of competition in the 2010 Winter Olympics, and the 52nd running of the Daytona 500, as would have been the case had the game been played on February 14 per its traditional post-Super Bowl scheduling.\nTeams.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nThe New Orleans Saints finished the season with an NFC best 13–3 record and went on to advance to the first Super Bowl in their 43 years as an NFL team. After joining the NFL in 1967, it took them 21 years to record their first winning season and another 13 years after that to win their first playoff game. Five years later, the New Orleans area suffered another setback when the Louisiana Superdome was devastated with the rest of the city by Hurricane Katrina, forcing them to play all of their home games in elsewhere as they finished with a 3–13 record (see \"Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints\"). But in the off-season, the team's fortunes began to turn. First, they signed free agent quarterback Drew Brees, who would go on to throw for more passing yards than any other quarterback over the next four seasons. They also drafted multi-talented Heisman Trophy winning (since vacated) running back Reggie Bush, receiver Marques Colston, and guard Jahri Evans, three players who would become major contributors on the Saints' offense. The following season, New Orleans improved to 10–6 and advanced to the NFC title game for the first time, which they lost to the Chicago Bears. Although they failed to make the playoffs over the next two seasons, they continued to sign new talent, and by 2009 they were ready to make another run at the Super Bowl.\nThe Saints' offense led the NFL in scoring, averaging just under 32 points per game. Brees finished the season as the NFL's top rated quarterback (109.6), completing an NFL-record 70.6% of his passes for 4,338 yards and 34 touchdowns, with just 11 interceptions. His top target was Colston, who caught 70 passes for 1,074 yards and 9 touchdowns, but he had plenty of other weapons, such as receivers Devery Henderson (51 receptions) and Robert Meachem (45), along with tight ends Jeremy Shockey (48) and Dave Thomas (35). With fullback Heath Evans out of action due to injury for most of the season, Dave Thomas often lined up as a fullback, with tackle Zach Strief serving as an extra blocker on short yardage plays. The ground attack was led by running backs Pierre Thomas and Mike Bell. Thomas rushed for 793 yards and caught 39 passes for 302, while Bell added 654 yards on the ground. Bush was also a major contributor, rushing for 390 yards (with a 5.6 yards per carry average), catching 47 passes for 335 yards, and adding another 130 yards returning punts. New Orleans also had a strong offensive line with three Pro Bowl selections: guard Jahri Evans, center Jonathan Goodwin, and tackle Jon Stinchcomb.\nDefensive lineman Will Smith led the team in sacks with 13. Another big weapon on defense was linebacker Jonathan Vilma, who led the team with 87 tackles and intercepted three passes. The Saints' secondary was led by 12-year veteran safety Darren Sharper, who recorded 9 interceptions and set an NFL record by returning them for 376 yards and three touchdowns. Cornerback Tracy Porter was also effective, recording 49 tackles and 4 picks with one touchdown.\nThe Saints started out the season strong, winning their first 13 games. But then they became the first 13–0 team ever to lose their last three games of the year. After losing their 14th game to the Dallas Cowboys 24–17, they suffered a narrow loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (20–17 in overtime) after Garrett Hartley missed a potential game-winning field goal. With the team's playoff seed clinched, head coach Sean Payton chose to rest Brees and other starters in the final game of the season, resulting in a 23–10 loss to the Carolina Panthers. The string of defeats cast a cloud over the team's postseason chances. Still, they clinched the No. 1 NFC playoff seed and scored 76 points in their two playoff wins en route to their first ever Super Bowl.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nIndianapolis had the NFL-best 14–2 record, winning seven games by less than a touchdown, on their way to earning their second Super Bowl appearance in the last four years. Once again, the Colts boasted a powerful offense led by 10-time Pro Bowl quarterback Peyton Manning, who threw for over 4,500 yards and 33 touchdowns during the season, with only 16 interceptions, earning him a 99.9 passer rating and a league record fourth National Football League Most Valuable Player Award. Under the protection of Pro Bowl center Jeff Saturday and the rest of the line, Manning had been sacked just 13 times during the regular season, the fewest in the NFL. His top targets were veteran receiver Reggie Wayne and tight end Dallas Clark, who both recorded 100 receptions and 10 touchdowns. Wayne led the team with 1,260 yards, while Clark was second with 1,106. Manning also had other reliable targets, such as recently drafted receivers Austin Collie (60 receptions for 676 yards and 7 touchdowns) and Pierre Garçon (47 receptions for 765 yards and 4 touchdowns). Running back Joseph Addai led the Colts' ground game with 821 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, while also catching 51 passes for another 336 yards and 3 scores.\nIndianapolis' defensive line was led by Pro Bowl defensive ends Robert Mathis and Dwight Freeney. Freeney led the team with 13.5 sacks, while Mathis added 9.5 sacks and forced 5 fumbles. Behind them, the Colts had a solid corps of linebackers featuring Clint Session and Gary Brackett, who each recorded 80 tackles. Pro Bowl safety Antoine Bethea led the secondary with 70 tackles and four interceptions.\nUnder their new coach Jim Caldwell, the Colts started off the season with 14 consecutive wins before suffering their first loss to the New York Jets, 29–15, a game in which Caldwell made the controversial decision to rest his starters after the team took a slim lead rather than keep them in to play for a chance at a 16–0 season. Indianapolis finished the season at 14–2 following a loss to the Buffalo Bills, in which they rested their starters and went on to advance to the Super Bowl, making them perfect in all their games in which their starters played all four-quarters.\nCaldwell led the Colts to the Super Bowl the season after Tony Dungy retired, just like in Tampa Bay when Jon Gruden led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to Super Bowl XXXVII after Dungy was fired. Senior offensive line coach Howard Mudd retired following the game.\nPlayoffs.\nThe Saints started off their playoff run with a dominating 45–14 win over the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals. The Cardinals were coming off a 51–45 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers in which they racked up 531 yards against a defense ranked second in the league in total yards allowed. However, although the Cardinals scored on their first play of the game, the Saints dominated the Cardinals with 35 points in the first half. First, Lynell Hamilton scored on a 1-yard run. Then, Sharper recovered a fumble from the Cardinals, setting up Brees' touchdown pass to Shockey. Following a punt, Bush scored on a franchise playoff record 46-yard run. In the second quarter, Brees added two more touchdown passes, one to Henderson on a flea flicker and the other to Colston that was set up by a Will Smith interception, giving them a 35–14 first half lead before adding 10 more points in the second half on a Hartley field goal and Bush's 83-yard punt return. Bush racked up 217 all-purpose yards, while Brees threw for 247 yards and three touchdowns.\nTheir opponent in the NFC Championship Game was the Minnesota Vikings, led by 11-time Pro Bowl quarterback Brett Favre, who had thrown four touchdown passes in their divisional round win over the Dallas Cowboys. Even though the Saints' offense could only muster 257 total yards, their defense made up for it by forcing five turnovers. Additionally, the Saints outgained the Vikings in punt and kickoff return yards 166 to 50. The key play of the game occurred late in the fourth quarter with the score tied 28–28 and the Vikings driving for a potential game-winning field goal. With less than a minute left, they reached the Saints 33-yard line. But after two runs for no gain and a penalty that pushed them back to the 38, Porter picked off a pass from Favre to send the game into overtime. After the Saints won the coin toss, Pierre Thomas's 40-yard kickoff return set up a 10-play, 39-yard drive that ended with a game winning 40-yard field goal by Hartley, sending the Saints to their first ever Super Bowl.\nThe Colts' first opponent was the Baltimore Ravens, a 9–7 squad that had advanced to the divisional round by defeating the New England Patriots 33–14, forcing four turnovers from their All-Pro quarterback Tom Brady. Against the Colts, however, all they could manage was a field goal on their opening drive. Indianapolis built up a 17–3 first half lead with a Matt Stover field goal and Manning's touchdown passes to Wayne and Collie. In the second half, the Colts survived two interceptions from Ravens safety Ed Reed on one drive, one of which Reed fumbled, and the other which was called back by a penalty. Stover, who spent 18 years with the Modell franchise, finished the drive with his second field goal to make final score 20–3, as their defense put the game away by forcing two consecutive turnovers.\nTheir next opponent was in the AFC Championship Game against the New York Jets, who had made the playoffs in part due to Caldwell's decision to bench his starters in their Week 16 meeting. This time, the Colts would have to mount a comeback, as the Jets built up a 17–6 first half lead. Yet the Colts would step up to the challenge, scoring 24 unanswered points. First, Manning completed three passes to Collie for 80 yards, the last one a 16-yard touchdown completion to cut the score to 17–13 at the end of the half. Manning added two more touchdown passes in the second half, one to Garçon and one to Clark, and Stover added a 21-yard field goal to close out the scoring. Manning finished the game with 377 passing yards and three touchdowns, while Garçon and Collie had over 100 receiving yards each.\nThis was the first Super Bowl matchup in which both teams had a first-round bye since Super Bowl XXXIX. All four of the Super Bowls in-between had one team that played all three rounds (two of which were wild card teams), with three of those teams (including the Colts in Super Bowl XLI) winning it all.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nThe game was televised live in the United States on CBS, capping the network's 50th season of NFL coverage (1956–93; 1998–present). This was the 17th Super Bowl telecast for CBS, the largest total among the \"big four\" US television networks. CBS had also broadcast the previous Super Bowl held in South Florida (XLI). Play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz and color commentator Phil Simms were in the broadcast booth, with Steve Tasker and Solomon Wilcots serving as sideline reporters. The game was preceded by \"The Super Bowl Today\", a four-hour pregame show hosted by James Brown and featuring analysts Dan Marino, Boomer Esiason, Shannon Sharpe and Bill Cowher along with several other commentators, which started at 2pm EST. A kickoff show for the game aired from 6pm EST to 6:28pm EST. A Spanish language broadcast was aired on the second audio program, with play-by-play announcer Armando Quintero and color analyst Benny Ricardo.\nWith an average U.S. audience of 106.5 million viewers, this was the third most-watched Super Bowl, trailing only the 111 million viewers for Super Bowl XLV the following year and 111.3 million viewers for Super Bowl XLVI. At the time, it was the most-watched program of any kind in American television history, beating the 27-year-long record previously held by the final episode of \"M*A*S*H\", \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", which coincidentally, also aired on CBS, and was watched by 105.97 million viewers. An estimated 153.4 million total viewers watched all or part of the game. The game drew a national Nielsen rating of 45.0 with a 68 share, the highest for a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXX in 1996 (46.0/68). The telecast drew a 56.3 rating in New Orleans and a 54.2 rating in Indianapolis, first and fourth respectively among local markets.\nAdvertising.\nNotable returnees and absences.\nPerennial Super Bowl advertisers Anheuser–Busch InBev and CareerBuilder stated their commitment to advertise in Super Bowl XLIV, showing eight and two different spots during the game, respectively. A 30-second spot cost US $2.8 million with several advertisers getting discounts, down from the previous year's $3 million. All advertising slots were sold out on February 1, 2010, six days before the game. Pepsi-Cola had previously stated their commitment to advertise, but then said they would not be buying any commercial time, marking the first time in 23 years that Pepsi did not run an ad during the Super Bowl itself. FedEx also stated that they would not buy ad time. Both Pepsi and FedEx are official NFL sponsors. Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple Group capitalized on Pepsi's absence by buying ads in the game; Dr Pepper's ad featured KISS performing \"Calling Dr. Love\", while one of Coca-Cola's three ads featured Montgomery Burns (of Fox's \"The Simpsons\") losing everything he owns. Also for the second straight year, one of the Big Three American automobile makers – General Motors – did not have a commercial in the game. Ford had one commercial for the Ford Edge featuring Mike Rowe. Chrysler's Dodge brand did advertise this year for its Dodge Charger, narrated by Michael C. Hall.\nWhat aired.\nFrito-Lay's Doritos brand, in turn owned by PepsiCo, had four consumer-created advertisements scheduled. The first three ads – running in the first quarter – featured a sly dog using an anti-bark collar to his advantage to steal a man's Doritos, a fast-handed boy defending his Doritos and his mother from a potential suitor, and a man faking his death for free Doritos. The fourth ad, featuring an angry gym rat who was overprotective for his Doritos being stolen, aired in the fourth quarter. Had three of the ads topped the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter rankings, the commercial's creators would have won a total of US$5 million ($1 million for first, $600,000 for second and $400,000 for third, plus a $1 million bonus for each of the three finalists). The previous year, Joe and David Herbert's \"Free Doritos\" ad topped the survey and won $1 million. The United States Census Bureau spent $2.5million on a 30-second spot, directed by noted independent filmmaker Christopher Guest, for the 2010 United States Census, which urged Americans to answer its questionnaires that will be sent out in the next few weeks. McDonald's aired a commercial, updating a famous ad from the early 1990s, in which NBA superstars LeBron James and Dwight Howard (replacing Michael Jordan and Larry Bird) play an otherworldly game of H-O-R-S-E, with a McDonald's lunch going to the winner – however, they soon look over and see that Bird has helped himself to it. Mars Chocolate returned three years after its controversial Snickers ad that was protested by gay groups with two men kissing one another that was pulled one day following the game (see \"Super Bowl XLI: Commercials\"). The commercial – winner of the annual Ad Meter survey – featured veteran actors Betty White and Abe Vigoda playing full-contact backyard football.\nThe rest of the Top Five:\nThe YouTube Top Five of their \"2010 Ad Blitz\" were:\nADBOWL results reflected the following ranking:\nInternet domain registrar GoDaddy, which created a racy ad the year after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, bought two ads in the Super Bowl for the sixth consecutive year. Advertising Age reported that Paramount Pictures bought a Super Bowl spot for the upcoming films \"Iron Man 2\" and \"The Last Airbender\". A trailer for the HBO miniseries \"The Pacific\" was also aired.\nOther advertisers for 2010 included Homeaway Inc., paying tribute to \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" with their stars Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo, and Diamond Foods, who returned to promote both its Emerald Nuts brand and Pop Secret popcorn, which they bought from General Mills two years before. Boost Mobile aired a special ad, celebrating the 25th Anniversary of The Super Bowl Shuffle, featuring many of the 1985 Chicago Bears to advertise their US$50 per month service. Also, in a CBS-produced promo for the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", the eponymous host and his longtime talk show rival, Jay Leno, appeared together with Oprah Winfrey.\nControversies.\nThree advertisers in particular raised eyebrows with their choice to advertise during the Super Bowl. One new advertiser, Focus on the Family, aired a commercial featuring 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow and his mother that elicited criticism from some women's groups who demanded CBS cancel the ad because they claimed it would be divisive, under the impression that it would mention Tebow's mother was advised, for health issues, to abort her son Tim, but she chose to give birth to him. In the first quarter, CBS aired the advertisement, which had not been pre-released to the public. Per a statement released earlier, the ad did not mention the topic of abortion explicitly.\nOne proposed sponsor, ManCrunch, a gay dating site that bills itself as a place \"where many many many men come out to play\", had expressed interest in purchasing a 30-second advertisement. The ManCrunch advertisement would have depicted a male Green Bay Packers fan and a male Minnesota Vikings fan reaching into the same bowl of potato chips at the same time and, after a brief pause, begin to passionately kiss. ManCrunch's ad, which has since been released to the public, was initially put on a waiting list before the network outright rejected it due to it violating CBS's broadcast standards. ManCrunch immediately accused CBS of discrimination. Some observers suspect that their advertisement was an attempt at ambush marketing and free publicity. Another ad that was rejected by CBS for failure to meet standards was for the texting service kgb, which focuses on two men with CGI-enhanced images bent over with their heads in their posteriors, while an actor, Sean Gunn, portraying an agent stated that \"They had their head up their [backsides]\". kgb instead aired an ad with two people who had to find the Japanese word for \"I surrender\" before being run over by a sumo wrestler. Another ad for Bud Light which was rejected showed workers stripping down for a charity clothes drive in exchange for free beer. All of the rejected ads were shown on YouTube.\nAmong other rejected or modified ads were one for Electronic Arts' \"Dante's Inferno\", which had to be edited for content (the closing phrase, originally intended to read \"go to Hell\", was replaced with \"Hell awaits\"), and GoDaddy's originally planned advertisement. Career Builder's ad, showing people dressed too casually for \"Casual Friday\" and a Dockers ad to promote a free pair of their pants with men in shirts but sans trousers aired back-to-back early in the second quarter.\nAn E*TRADE advertisement, continuing their theme of talking babies on a Web cam, featured a boyfriend-stealing, \"milkaholic\" baby girl named \"Lindsay.\" Actress Lindsay Lohan, who has a history of alcoholism and was noted for having tried in the early 2000s to date popular young men who were already dating other women, attempted to sue E*TRADE over the advertisement, seeking US$100 million in damages, under the impression that the advertisement defamed her via subliminal messaging and violated her personality rights. E*TRADE denied the allegations and stated the name \"Lindsay\" came from a member of the accounting staff. Lohan and E*TRADE settled the lawsuit in September 2010; the terms were confidential.\nInternational.\nViewers worldwide were able to watch on the following channels:\nRadio.\nOn radio, Westwood One had the national English-language broadcast rights to the game in the United States and Canada. Marv Albert (play-by-play) and Boomer Esiason (color commentator) called the game for the network; it was the last broadcast Albert would do for Westwood One, due to his desire to focus on his basketball coverage duties. The teams' flagship stations also carried the game with their local announcers: WLHK-FM and WFNI-AM in Indianapolis (with Bob Lamey and Will Wolford announcing) and WWL-FM/AM in New Orleans (with Jim Henderson and Hokie Gajan announcing). The Saints' radio broadcast on WWL-AM was available throughout much of the United States, since WWL is a Class A clear channel station. Univision Radio aired a Spanish-language feed for Hispanophone American listeners (with Clemson Smith-Muñiz and David Crommett announcing).\nSirius XM Satellite Radio carried 14 game feeds in ten languages to Sirius subscribers, as well as to XM subscribers with the \"Best of Sirius\" package. In addition to the four US feeds mentioned above, Sirius carried the following international feeds:\nFieldPass, the subscription Internet radio service provided by the league at NFL.com, also carried most of these feeds. Due to contractual restrictions, only Sirius XM and FieldPass were permitted to carry the local team broadcasts along with WLHK, WFNI and WWL, with the teams' other network radio affiliates instead airing the Westwood One feed.\nEntertainment and other ceremonies.\nPregame.\nBarenaked Ladies played the Super Bowl Saturday Night event with O.A.R. and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Chris Daughtry, Steve Winwood and Queen Latifah performed during the Super Bowl pre-game tailgate party, which started at 2:00 p.m.\nQueen Latifah sang \"America the Beautiful\" and Carrie Underwood sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Underwood's performance marked the third straight year that an alumnus of \"American Idol\" has been invited to perform the national anthem, joining Jordin Sparks at Super Bowl XLII and Jennifer Hudson a year later. Translation of both songs into American Sign Language was provided by Kinesha Battles, a student at the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind.\nTo commemorate the 15th anniversary of the San Francisco 49ers' fifth Super Bowl victory, which took place at this stadium, Jerry Rice, who had also been MVP of Super Bowl XXIII, another Super Bowl played at this stadium, joined the coin toss ceremonies. Rice had just been named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2010. The rest of the class – Rickey Jackson, Dick LeBeau, Floyd Little, Russ Grimm, John Randle, and Emmitt Smith – were named the day before. The Saints won the coin toss, marking the 13th straight Super Bowl the NFC won the toss (the Cardinals won the toss in Super Bowl XLIII but elected to defer to the second half, giving the Steelers the ball to open the game). The coin used for the toss was flown into space on STS-129 before the game.\nHalftime.\nThe Who performed at the Super Bowl XLIV halftime show. The band played a medley of their hits, consisting of \"Pinball Wizard\", \"Baba O'Riley\", \"Who Are You\", \"See Me, Feel Me\", and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". For the first time since the Super Bowl XXXIV halftime show, there was no crowd of fans surrounding the halftime stage. This performance was also released as downloadable content for the Rock Band series, named \"The Who Super Bowl S-mashup\".\nMerchandising.\nRetailers had ordered much more New Orleans Saints merchandise prior to the game than they had ordered Colts merchandise. The NFL estimated that US$100million worth of Super Bowl merchandise would be sold.\nGame summary.\nFirst quarter.\nAs the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Colts elected to wear their home blue uniforms with white pants, while the Saints wore their road white uniforms with old gold pants.\nThe Saints won the coin toss and chose to receive, but their first possession resulted in a punt after going three-and-out.\nThe Colts offense took the field for the first time, with the ball spotted at their own 27-yard line. The Colts put together a drive that went 53 yards and resulted in a 38-yard field goal by kicker Matt Stover. At 42 years old, Stover became the oldest person in NFL history to play in a Super Bowl.\nFollowing the game's first score, Courtney Roby returned the ensuing kickoff to the New Orleans 26-yard line. Approaching the 25-yard line, Roby swooped into a dive and appeared to fumble the ball, but he was ruled down by contact. This time, the Saints managed to get a first down with a 16-yard completion from Drew Brees to Reggie Bush, but they were eventually forced to punt again. Punter Thomas Morstead pinned the Colts back at their own 4-yard line with a 46-yard kick.\nIndianapolis responded with a 96-yard scoring drive, tying the record for the longest drive in Super Bowl history. Joseph Addai rushed three times for 53 yards on the drive, while Manning completed three passes for 35 yards, the last one a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Garçon, increasing the Colts lead to 10–0.\nSecond quarter.\nThe Saints' next drive carried over from the previous quarter. Brees completed three passes for 36 yards as the Saints advanced to the Colts' 22-yard line. But on third down, Brees was sacked for a 7-yard loss by Dwight Freeney, forcing New Orleans to settle for a 46-yard field goal from Garrett Hartley. After scoring points on their first 2 drives, the Colts looked to add more, but Garcon dropped a pass on 3rd down. The Colts were forced to punt, and the Saints took over driving down into Colt territory. They drove down the field to a 1st-and-goal at the Colts' 3-yard line. A false start penalty set them back to the 8, and after getting a yard away from the end zone, they attempted 3rd and 4th down runs. They failed to convert both times. The Colts ran three straight running plays in an effort to wind down the clock and go to halftime with a seven-point lead, but the Saints kept the Colts from getting another first down. Following Bush's 4-yard punt return to the New Orleans 48, with only one timeout left to use in the half, the Saints got back into field goal territory, and Hartley hit a 44-yard field goal as time expired, with the Colts still leading 10–6. This was the first 10–6 halftime score in Super Bowl history.\nThird quarter.\nThe Colts were set to receive the ball to start the second half but were caught by surprise when the Saints executed an onside kick. This was the first onside kick attempted before the fourth quarter in Super Bowl history, a play the Saints referred to as \"Ambush.\" Thomas Morstead kicked the ball to his left, and after traveling almost 15 yards, the ball bounced off the face-mask of the Colts' Hank Baskett, who failed to make a clean recovery. Several players dove for the loose ball, creating a pile that took over a minute for the officiating crew to separate. When the dust finally cleared, linebacker Jonathan Casillas of New Orleans was officially credited with the recovery on the 42-yard line, but Casillas and other Saints players insisted that it was actually safety Chris Reis who came up with the football. The Saints' offense took over and stormed down the field on an effective 58-yard drive in which they never faced a third down. Brees completed five consecutive passes for 58 yards on the drive and capped it off with a 'check-down' pass on the right side to Pierre Thomas, who took it 16 yards to the end zone behind blocks from Jonathan Goodwin, Jahri Evans, Devery Henderson, Kyle Eckel, Carl Nicks, and Jeremy Shockey, to give the Saints their first lead of the game at 13–10.\nManning and the Colts answered with their own touchdown drive, moving the ball 76 yards in ten plays. Clark caught 3 passes for 45 yards, while Joseph Addai finished the drive off with a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Colts back on top 17–13 with 6:15 remaining in the quarter. For just the second time in Super Bowl history both teams scored touchdowns on their initial possessions of the second half; the only other time occurred in Super Bowl XIV.\nHartley would bring the Saints to within one point of tying the game at 17–16, with his third field goal, launched from 47 yards away. In doing so he became the first kicker in Super Bowl history to score three field goals of 40 or more yards in one game.\nThis was the first one-point lead after the third quarter in Super Bowl history and second closest game after three-quarters, behind Super Bowl XXXIX which was tied between the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles.\nFourth quarter.\nIndianapolis responded with a drive to the New Orleans 33-yard line, only to have Stover miss a 51-yard field goal attempt, giving the ball back to the Saints with good field position on their 41-yard line. After that, Brees led the Saints on another touchdown drive featuring seven different players getting the ball. Bush started off the drive with a 12-yard run, and then Devery Henderson caught a pass on the Colts' 36-yard line. Following an 8-yard catch and run by Bush, Brees completed passes to Colston, Robert Meachem and tight end David Thomas, moving the ball to the 5-yard line. After a 3-yard run by Pierre Thomas, Brees threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. Rather than settle for a six-point lead, and risk a potential Colts game-winning touchdown, the Saints chanced a two-point conversion. Lance Moore received a pass and attempted to stretch the ball out over the goal line as he fell to the ground and rolled over on his head. The ball was kicked away from his hands by defender Jacob Lacey, and the play was ruled an incomplete pass, prompting a coach's challenge from Sean Payton. After the review, the ruling on the field was overturned when it was determined that Moore maintained possession of the ball long enough and the ball had crossed the plane of the goal line for a successful conversion, giving the Saints a 24–17 advantage.\nOn the ensuing drive, Manning led the Colts into Saints territory in an attempt to tie the game. However, Tracy Porter intercepted a pass by Manning at the Saints 26 for the first takeaway of the game and returned it 74 yards for a touchdown; following the successful extra point, the Saints' lead grew to 31–17 with 3:12 remaining. Porter's interception return for a touchdown improved teams to 10–0 in Super Bowls when returning an interception for a touchdown, although that record is now 12–1 following Super Bowl LI (when the New England Patriots overcame a 28–3 deficit versus the Atlanta Falcons).\nNow down by two touchdowns, the Colts needed a touchdown on their next drive, followed by a successful onside kick, to stay alive, though they still had all three of their timeouts to use. They were able to drive to the New Orleans 3-yard line. When an offensive pass interference penalty on 1st and goal pushed them back 10 yards, the Colts got those 10 yards back on the next play. However, the next three plays saw a tipped pass that went off the goal post and incomplete, a loss of two yards on a rushing play, and a pass that went through the hands of wide receiver Reggie Wayne and incomplete, effectively sealing the win for the Saints. Brees knelt the ball with 0:44 left on the clock, ending Super Bowl XLIV and winning the Saints' first league championship in franchise history, the first major league world championship for the state of Louisiana.\nStatistical overview.\nDrew Brees was named Super Bowl MVP for tying a Super Bowl record by completing 32 of 39 passes, with 288 passing yards and two touchdowns. After the game, Brees said, \"Four years ago, who ever thought this would be happening when 85 percent of the city was under water? Most people left not knowing if New Orleans would ever come back, or if the organization would ever come back. We just all looked at one another and said, 'We are going to rebuild together. We are going to lean on each other.' This is the culmination in all that belief.\"\nFinal statistics.\nSources: NFL.com Super Bowl XLIV, Super Bowl XLIV Play Finder NO, Super Bowl XLIV Play Finder Ind, Hoffco Super Bowl XLIV Play by Play\nIndividual statistics.\nNotes:\nAftermath.\nOver a two-month period before Super Bowl 50, Slate writer Justin Peters viewed and ranked every single Super Bowl game in history. About Super Bowl XLIV, which he ranked the fifth best, Peters had this to say: \"...coming as it did five years after New Orleans was flooded in Hurricane Katrina, the Saints' victory actually \"mattered\".\"\nThe Saints finished the next season with an 11–5 record, but failed to defend their league title after they were eliminated by the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card playoff round. Super Bowl XLIV later became the subject of the wider New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, also known as \"Bountygate\", in which the NFL alleged in 2012 that several Saints defenders operated a slush fund that was in operation from the 2009 season and Super Bowl XLIV, through 2011. This alleged slush fund paid out bonuses, or \"bounties\", for in-game performance in violation of NFL rules, including deliberately injuring or knocking opposing players out of games. The league responded with some of the most severe sanctions in the league's 92-year history, and among the most severe punishments for an on-field incident in North American professional sports history. On appeal, former Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, appointed by Goodell to investigate, agreed that the bounty program had taken place, but he disagreed that it was the NFL's place to enact disciplinary measures and contended it was the duty of the coaches and management. All player suspensions were overturned in 2012. In 2012, New Orleans failed to make the playoffs for the first time since their Super Bowl win, with the sanctions for Bountygate cited as one of the primary causes. The Saints rebounded in 2013, but were eliminated in the Divisional playoff round by the eventual Super Bowl XLVIII champion Seattle Seahawks. They returned to the playoffs in 2017 by defeating the Carolina Panthers in the Wild Card Round, but lost to the Minnesota Vikings in the Divisional Round. The next season they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional Round to advance to their first NFC Championship Game since 2009 but lost to the Los Angeles Rams in controversial fashion. After playoff losses in 2019 and 2020, Saints quarterback and Super Bowl XLIV MVP Drew Brees retired after 20 seasons. Super Bowl XLIV remains the franchise's only Super Bowl appearance.\nThe Colts would finish the next season with a 10–6 record, but lost in the Wild Card round to the New York Jets. After that, the Colts plummeted to 2–14 after they lost Peyton Manning for the 2011 season to neck surgery. Manning was released following the season and signed with the Denver Broncos, with whom he won Super Bowl 50. The Colts would then proceed to draft quarterback Andrew Luck first overall in the 2012 NFL Draft, with whom they went 11–5 for three consecutive years, won the AFC South twice, and made the , losing to the New England Patriots 45–7. In the 2015 and 2016 Colts' seasons, they finished 8–8 and missed the playoffs, which was mostly because Luck missed 10 combined games due to various injuries. In the 2017 season, the team finished 4–12 after they lost Luck to a shoulder injury for the year. Since Super Bowl XLIV, Indianapolis has been 106–103–1, with a 3–5 postseason record.\nThe Saints were the last team to win a championship game of a major professional sports league in North America on their first attempt until 2019, when both the Toronto Raptors of the NBA and the MLB's Washington Nationals accomplished the feat."

        "text": "Ian White (born June 4, 1984) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played over 500 games in the National Hockey League. In a career spanning parts of nine seasons, White suited up for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, Carolina Hurricanes, San Jose Sharks and Detroit Red Wings. White was originally selected in the sixth round, 191st overall in the 2002 NHL Draft. He returned to professional hockey in 2022 with the Columbus River Dragons of the Federal Prospects Hockey League. On October 26, 2022, White was traded to the Motor City Rockers of the Federal Prospects Hockey League. On January 23, 2023, White was signed to a standard player contract with the Norfolk Admirals the ECHL. He was released on November 14, 2023.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nWhite was drafted by the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in the fifth round, 89th overall, in the 1999 WHL Bantam Draft. His first season with Swift Current was fairly successful, as he scored 12 goals and 31 assists in 69 games, which placed him seventh on the team in scoring. The team finished the season first in their division. In White's second season with Swift Current, he fared much better, scoring 32 goals and 47 assists for 79 points in 70 games for second place on the team in scoring. This generated interest amongst NHL teams leading up to the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, where he was ultimately selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the sixth round, 191st overall.\nIn 2002–03, White finished third on Swift Current in scoring with 24 goals and 44 assists for 68 points in 64 games, and was also named to the WHL's First All Star Team and the CHL's Second All Star Team. He then played for Canada at the 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Canada finished second place to Russia. White was primarily the seventh defenceman and powerplay specialist for Canada, where he scored two goals and four assists for six points in six games.\nThe following year, however, White broke his left ankle in late October 2004 and thereby could not be afforded a spot on the 2004 World Junior team.\nProfessional.\nWhite made his debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 2005–06 season, scoring five points (one goal and four assists) in his first five career NHL games. That same season, White was named to Canada's Spengler Cup squad, which made it into the final against Metallurg Magnitogorsk, losing 8–3. White accumulated one goal in the tournament.\nIn 2006–07, White scored three goals and 23 assists for a total of 26 points, leaving him tied for second in scoring among rookie defencemen. He spent much of the season playing with the hulking Hal Gill, giving rise to the nickname of \"Barney and Fred\" due to the almost full foot in height Gill has on White, as well as the massive weight difference.\nDue to the high number of defencemen on the roster for the 2008–09 season for the Maple Leafs, White was sat out for the first 11 games of the season before playing his first game, in which he spent some time playing as a third-line forward. In spite of a lack of experience in the position, in eight games there he managed three goals, seven points and a +5 plus-minus rating before returning to defence. As the season progressed, he received more and more ice time, eventually averaging over 25 minutes a game by the end of the year, and finishing the regular season with ten goals, 26 points and a +6 plus-minus.\nOn January 31, 2010, White was traded, along with Jamal Mayers, Niklas Hagman and Matt Stajan, to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Dion Phaneuf, Fredrik Sjöström and prospect Keith Aulie. White re-signed with the Flames during the off-season on a one-year contract worth $2.99 million, but was traded, along with Brett Sutter, to the Carolina Hurricanes in mid-November in exchange for Tom Kostopoulos and Anton Babchuk. White played in 39 games for the Hurricanes, recording 11 assists before being dealt again three months later, this time to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a second-round pick in 2012. He recorded an assist in his first game as a Shark and also recorded his first career Stanley Cup playoff point in Game 1 of the 2011 conference quarter-finals against the Los Angeles Kings.\nThe following summer, White signed a two-year, $5.75 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings. He scored his first goal with Detroit on October 7 during a 5–3 victory over the Ottawa Senators, and finished with 32 points during the 2011–12 season. The following season, shortened because due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, saw White's role with the Red Wings dramatically reduced; he appeared in only 25 of the team's 48 games and scored only four points. During 2012–13 lockout, White made controversial public comments about NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, referring to him as \"an idiot...[who has] done nothing but damage the game.\" White later expressed regret for making the remarks.\nWithout a contract for the 2013–14 season, White signed a professional try-out contract with the Winnipeg Jets, but was released prior to the end of training camp. White then played a few games with the Steinbach Huskies senior hockey team before joining Traktor Chelyabinsk in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He played just ten games with Chelyabinsk, registering one assist.\nWhite returned to North America midway into the 2014–15 season and signed a professional try-out contract with the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL); however, he was later released by Providence less than a month later. He subsequently joined the Milwaukee Admirals and remained with the team until the end of the season.\nOn December 30, 2021, the Columbus River Dragons of the Federal Prospects Hockey League announced that they signed White to a contract.\nLegal issues.\nWhite was arrested and charged for impaired driving twice in 2005 and 2006, and later arrested again by Toronto police for driving while his licence was suspended. On November 20, 2015, he was arrested at his home in Kenora, Ontario and charged with various drugs and weapons offences.\nPersonal life.\nWhite is the son of former Steinbach, Manitoba minor hockey coach Allan White, who was Ian's coach and went on to work as a guidance counselor at Steinbach Regional Secondary School.\nWhite has two children with his wife, Tess. The couple separated following the end of his NHL career.Despite multiple attempts by White’s Wife to legally end the marriage. The two are still legally married. "

The record was released on 11 January 1993 through the label Warp. It entered the UK Dance Albums Chart at No.2 on 23January 1993. James' previous album, \"Selected Ambient Works8592\", was then at No. 9 on the chart, and James briefly had two records in the Dance Albums Top 10 under different pseudonyms. The 2001 reissue edition includes the previously unreleased tracks \"Portreath Harbour\" and \"Redruth School\".\nBackground.\nThe cover of the album features a photograph of Chapel Porth beach in Cornwall, where James spent time with his sisters as a child; James thanks the seaside village in the liner notes. The title \"Surfing on Sine Waves\" was chosen by Warp founder Rob Mitchell after James mentioned that \"loads of people I knew growing up in Cornwall were poser surfers and I didn't wanna hang around with them.\" The record is the second release in Warp's \"Artificial Intelligence\" series.\nReissue track \"Redruth School\" references James's alma mater, Redruth School, while \"Portreath Harbour\" references Portreath.\nCritical reception.\nNed Raggett of AllMusic praised \"Surfing on Sine Waves\" as \"a great collection of abstract electronic/dance madness, caught somewhere between the driftiness of his more ambient works at the time and the rave-minded nuttiness of 'Digeridoo.'\" Mark Richard-San of \"Pitchfork\" wrote, \"Catchy, melodic and memorable tracks are what made the Aphex Twin so wonderful at his best; \"Surfing on Sine Waves\" has a handful of these, albeit in rough, embryonic form.\"\nIn 2012 \"Fact\" placed \"Surfing on Sine Waves\" at number 26 on its list of the \"100 Best Albums of the 1990s\". In 2017 \"Pitchfork\" placed it at number 26 on its list of the \"50 Best IDM Albums of All Time\". Writing for \"Pitchfork\", Andrew Nosnitsky said, \"These days, \"Surfing\" doesn't get mentioned as often as the louder, more ambitious, 'proper' Aphex records that would follow, but it's easily as refined on a technical level—and maybe even more emotionally rewarding.\"\nPersonnel.\nCredits adapted from liner notes."

        "title": "Brian Smith (ice hockey, born 1940)",
        "text": "Brian Desmond Smith (September 6, 1940 – August 2, 1995) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and sportscaster. Smith was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the son of former professional ice hockey player Des Smith and brother of former professional ice hockey goaltender Gary Smith. Smith was a professional ice hockey player from 1960 to 1973, playing 67 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Los Angeles Kings and Minnesota North Stars during the 1967–68 and 1968–69 seasons. He also later played for the Houston Aeros of the World Hockey Association during the 1972–73 season. Following his hockey career, Smith was a broadcaster for CJOH-TV in Ottawa until 1995, when he was shot and killed by gunman Jeffrey Arenburg.\nLife and career.\nCareer.\nSmith played junior hockey for the Brockville Junior Canadiens in 1959–60, making a Memorial Cup appearance in 1960. He began his professional ice hockey career with the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens of the EPHL from 1960 to 1963. He refused to report to the Springfield Indians in 1963 because he was wary of mistreatment by coach Eddie Shore. He played the 1963–64 season in Austria, under the assumed name Bobby Smith before joining the Indians, but only after being suspended by International Ice Hockey Federation President Bunny Ahearne for playing without his release. He played for the Indians from 1964 to 1967 and participated in the team's strike against Shore in 1966. Smith, along with teammate Bill White, got the little-known lawyer Alan Eagleson to represent the players in the conflict, which eventually started Eagleson's career as an agent. The players refused to practice and ultimately Shore was forced to sell the team to Kings owner Jack Kent Cooke for $900,000.\nWhen the NHL expanded in 1967, he was one of the players transferred to the new Los Angeles Kings franchise when they purchased the Indians franchise and its contracts, and he was one of the original Kings' players, playing the 1967–68 season with the Kings. He scored two goals against his brother, Gary Smith.\nIn the following season, he played for the Phoenix Roadrunners of the Western Hockey League and the Memphis South Stars of the CHL. He then returned to the NHL with the Minnesota North Stars in 1968–69, and finished his career with the WHA Houston Aeros in 1972–73. He broke his jaw in an exhibition game and soon after his career ended.\nIn 1973, Smith joined Ottawa television station CJOH-TV as the station's 6 PM sports anchor, a position he held until his death. He also participated in charitable activities, especially the Ottawa Boys and Girls Club.\nDeath.\nOn August 1, 1995, Smith was shot in CJOH's parking lot, just minutes after the end of the station's 6 PM newscast. He was on his way to a charitable fund-raising event for the Children's Wish Foundation. He died about 18 hours later on August 2 in the Ottawa Civic Hospital. The gunman, Jeffrey Arenburg, who had paranoid schizophrenia, had gone to CJOH because he believed the station was broadcasting messages in his head. Smith was the first broadcast personality that Arenburg recognized coming out of the building.\nSmith's death was a shock to the Ottawa sports community. The Ottawa Senators honoured him with a 'Smitty 18' patch on their jerseys, which they wore for the 1995–96 season and with a banner hanging in the rafters at Canadian Tire Centre. The press box at Canadian Tire Centre was also renamed the \"Brian 'Smitty' Smith Press Box\" in his honour. Flags flew at half-staff at an Ottawa Lynx baseball game, and a tribute was held by the Ottawa Rough Riders, whose players raised their helmets while the crowd joined in a one-minute cheer.\nGunman Arenburg was found to be not criminally responsible due to his mental disorder and was sentenced to a mental institution in 1997. He had previously been sentenced to a mental institution but had never reported. An inquest into Smith's killing recommended there should be more public protection and significant changes to the \"Mental Health Act\" of Ontario. The result, Brian's Law, was passed on June 21, 2000, by the Ontario Legislature.\nSmith's widow, \"Ottawa Citizen\" journalist Alana Kainz, established the Brian Smith Memorial Scholarship fund in Smith's memory, which provides tuition funds to attend college or university. It is administered by the Ottawa Boys and Girls Club. In 2001, the club renamed its summer camp from Camp Minwassin to Camp Smitty in Smith's honour. CJOH-TV established the Brian Smith Foundation to give disadvantaged children and young adults in the Ottawa region an opportunity to participate in athletics, recreation and education.\nIn 2005, he posthumously became a partial namesake of the Ernie Calcutt/Eddie MacCabe/Brian Smith Memorial Lifetime Achievement Award, established by the Ottawa Sport Award Society to recognize careers in journalism."

        "title": "Strategy of American football",
        "text": "Strategy is a major part of American football. \nBoth teams plan many aspects of their play, such as what formations they take, who they put on the field, and the roles and instructions each player is given for both offense and defense. Throughout a game, each team responds to the other's apparent strengths and weaknesses, trying various approaches to outmaneuver or overpower their opponent to win the game. On offense, a team's job is to score through touchdowns and field goals, all while being observant of the defensive strategy of the opposing team. On defense, the team's job on the field is to prevent the offense from scoring touchdowns and field goals and to possibly intercept the ball. \nOffensive strategy.\nThe goal of the offense is, most generally, to score points. To accomplish this goal, coaches and players plan and execute plays based on a variety of factors: The players involved, the opponent's defensive strategy, the amount of time remaining before halftime or the end of the game, and the number of points needed to win the game. Strategically, the offense can prolong their possession of the ball to prevent the opponent from scoring. Offensive scoring chances, or drives, end when they cannot move the ball 10 yards or the ball is turned over via fumble or interception.\nOffensive players.\nOn offense, there are three types of players: linemen, backs, and receivers. These players' positions and duties on the field vary from one offensive scheme to another.\nThe position names (as well as the abbreviations recognized by coaches, players, and fans) vary from one team's playbook to another, but what follows are among the most commonly used:\nBacks.\nBacks are so named because they line up behind (in back of) the line of scrimmage at the start of the play.\nOffensive formations.\nBefore the ball is snapped the offensive team lines up in a formation. The type of formation used is determined by the game situation. Teams often have \"special formations\" that they only use in obvious passing situations, short yardage, goal line situations, or formations they have developed for that particular game just to confuse the defense.\nThere are a nearly unlimited number of possible formations – a few of the more common ones are:\nOffensive plays.\nWhen the team is in formation and the quarterback gives a signal, either by calling out instructions or giving a non-verbal cue (a so-called \"silent count\"), the center snaps the ball to the quarterback and a play begins.\nRunning plays.\nA running play occurs when the quarterback hands the ball to another player, who then attempts to carry the ball past the line of scrimmage and gain yards, or the quarterback keeps the ball themself and runs beyond the line of scrimmage. In both cases, the offensive line's main job is to run block, preventing the defensive players from tackling the ball carrier.\nThe choice of running play depends on the strengths of an offensive team, the weaknesses of the defense they are opposing, and the distance needed to score a touchdown or gain a first down. There are many kinds of running plays, including:\nPassing plays.\nWhen a passing play occurs, the backs and receivers run specific patterns, or routes, and the quarterback throws the ball to one of the players. On these plays, the offensive line's main job is to prevent defensive players from tackling the quarterback before he throws the ball (a \"sack\") or disrupting the quarterback in any other way during the play.\nWhen successful, passing plays tend to cover more ground than running plays, so they are often used when the offensive team needs to gain a large number of yards. Even if they do not need to gain a large number of yards, it would be foolish to keep doing run plays because the defense could predict it. However, run plays are used to tire the defensive linemen in between passing plays in order to protect the QB from sacks. Run plays can also be used to set up pass plays called play-action. This is where the quarterback and running back will fake a run play while receivers run a route. The goal is for the defense to think it is a run play so the receivers will be open and be an easier completion for the quarterback. This will also keep the defense off balance if a team is successfully able to run the ball, the defense will be preparing for the run but when the offense runs a play action, it will be a big play if the pass is completed.\nDifferent kinds of pass plays include: \nEligible receivers.\nOne general rule teams must take into account when creating their passing strategy is that only certain players are allowed to catch forward passes. If a player who is not an eligible receiver receives a thrown pass, the team could be penalized. However, if prior to a play the team reports to the referee that a normally ineligible receiver will act as an eligible receiver for one play, that player is allowed to catch passes. Teams will use this strategy from time to time to confuse the defense or force them to devote more attention to possible pass catchers.\nSpecific offensive strategies.\nUsing a combination of passing plays and running plays, the offense tries to gain the yards needed for a first down, touchdown, or field goal. Over the years several football coaches and offensive coordinators have developed some well-known and widely used offensive strategies:\nPlay calling systems.\nDistinct from the offensive strategies or philosophies, which govern how a team moves the ball down the field, whether a team relies on downfield passes, short passes, inside runs, etc. are the ways in which plays are called. These play calling systems often developed alongside certain offensive strategies, though the systems themselves can work with any strategy. The differences between the systems focus on the specific language used to communicate plays to players. In the NFL, three basic systems predominate:\nDefensive strategy.\nThe goal of defensive strategy is to prevent the opposing offense from gaining yards and scoring points, either by preventing the offense from advancing the ball beyond the line of scrimmage or by the defense taking the ball away from the offense (referred to as a turnover) and scoring points themselves.\nDefensive players.\nOn defense, there are three types of players: linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs (also called secondary players). These players' specific positions on the field and duties during the game vary depending on the type of defense being used as well as the kind of offense the defense is facing.\nDefensive line.\nThe defensive line lines up in front of the offensive line. The defensive lineman's responsibility is to prevent the offensive line from opening up running lanes for the running back or to sack the quarterback, depending on whether the play is a passing or running play. Most of the time, defensive linemen attack the offensive line but in some plays they drop back in pass coverage to confuse the opposite team.\nLinebackers.\nLinebackers stand behind the defensive linemen or set themselves up on the line of scrimmage. Depending on the type of defensive strategy being used, a linebacker's responsibilities can include helping to stop the run, rushing the quarterback, or dropping back in pass protection.\nDefensive backs.\nDefensive backs stand behind the linebackers. Their primary responsibility is pass coverage, although they can also be involved in stopping the run or rushing the quarterback.\nDefensive formations.\nThe most common way to describe a basic defensive formation is by stating the number of linemen involved followed by the number of linebackers. The number of defensive backs is usually not mentioned, though if it is, (such as in the \"3–3–5\"), the number typically appears after the number of linebackers, thus the formula would go (# of linemen)–(# of linebackers)–(# of defensive backs [if stated]) in these situations. This naming rule does not always apply when the personnel for a certain formation are lined up in a way that changes the function of the players in the defense. A good example to help explain this would be the \"3–5–3\", which actually uses the 3–3–5 personnel, but has the five defensive backs arranged with \"3 deep\", thus grouping the other two defensive backs with the linebacker group.\nBy far the most common alignments are four down linemen and three linebackers (a \"4–3\" defense), or three down linemen and four linebackers (\"3–4\"), but other formations such as five linemen and two linebackers (\"5–2\"), or three linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs (\"3–3–5\") are also used by a number of teams.\nOn plays where the defense expects the offense to pass, naming emphasis is often placed on the number of defensive backs. In a basic 4–3 or 3–4 defense, there are four defensive backs on the field (2 cornerbacks [CB], 1 strong safety [SS], and 1 free safety [FS]). When one of the linemen or linebackers is removed and an additional defensive back is added, common alignments of these five defensive back packages are the \"nickel\" package, which includes 3 CB, 1 SS, and 1 FS, and the \"3–3–5\", which is a nickel package variant that includes either 2 CB, 2 SS, and 1 FS, or 3 CB, 1 SS, and 1 FS like the standard nickel package. When a sixth defensive back is inserted, it is known as a \"dime\" package (4CB, 1SS, 1FS). In rare instances when a seventh defensive back is inserted, it is known as a \"quarter\" package (5CB, 1SS, 1FS \"or\" 4CB, 2SS, 1FS).\nAs with offensive formations, there are many combinations that can be used to set up a defense. Unusual defensive alignments are constantly used in an effort to neutralize a given offense's strengths. In winning Super Bowl XXV, the New York Giants played with two down linemen, four linebackers and five defensive backs, a strategy that prevented their opponents, the Buffalo Bills, a team with a strong passing game, from completing long passes. In a 2004 game, the New England Patriots used no down linemen and seven linebackers for two plays against the Miami Dolphins.\nSome of the more familiar defensive formations include:\nDefensive plays.\nThe defense must wait until the ball is snapped by the opposing center before they can move across the line of scrimmage or otherwise engage any of the offensive players. Once an opposing offense has broken their huddle and lined up in their formation, defensive players often call out instructions to each other to make last-second adjustments to the defense.\nRun defense.\nTo prevent the opposing offense from gaining yards on the ground, a defense might put more emphasis on their run defense. This generally involves placing more players close to the line of scrimmage to get to the ball carrier more quickly. This strategy is often used when the opposing offense only needs to gain a few yards to make a first down or score a touchdown.\nPass defense.\nWhen the defense believes the opposing offense will pass the ball, they go into pass defense. There are two general schemes for defending against the pass:\nBlitz.\nThere are times when a defense believes that the best way to stop the offense is to rush the quarterback, which involves sending five or more players charging at the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle the quarterback before he can throw the ball or hand it to another player. Any player on the defense is allowed to rush the quarterback, and many schemes have been developed over 50 years that involve complicated or unusual blitz \"packages\".\nSpecific defensive strategies.\nDefensive strategies differ somewhat from offensive strategies in that, unlike offenses that have very specific, detailed plans and assignments for each player, defenses are more reactive, with each player's general goal being to \"stop the offense\" by tackling the ball carrier, breaking up passing plays, taking the ball away from the offense, or sacking the quarterback. Whereas precision and timing are among the most important parts of offensive strategy, defensive strategies often emphasize aggressiveness and the ability to react to plays as they develop.\nNevertheless, there are many defensive strategies that have been developed over the years that coaches use as a framework for their general defense, making specific adjustments depending on the capabilities of their players and the opponent they are facing.\nSome of the most commonly known and used defensive strategies include:\nSpecial teams strategy.\nThe special teams unit is a group of players who take the field during kickoffs, free kicks, punts, and field goal attempts. Most football teams' special teams include one or more kickers, a long snapper (who specializes in accurate snaps over long distances), kick returners who catch and carry the ball after it is kicked by the opposing team, and blockers who defend during kicks and returns.\nMost special teams are made up of players who act as backups or substitutes on the team's offensive and defensive units. Because of the risk of injury, it is uncommon for a starting offensive or defensive player to also play on a special teams unit.\nA variety of strategic plays can be attempted during kickoffs, punts, and field goals—to surprise the opposition and score points, gain yardage or first downs, or recover possession of the kicked ball.\nKickoffs.\nA kickoff occurs at the beginning of each half, overtime period (not in college), and following each touchdown, successful field goal, or safety. Strategically, the coach of the other team may choose to have his players kick the ball in one of several ways:\nPunts.\nThe \"no punting\" strategy is one that forsakes the practice of punting and instead attempts to make fourth down conversions on as many plays as possible. It has been implemented at Pulaski Academy, a top-ranked prep school, and has been advocated by Gregg Easterbrook in his \"Tuesday Morning Quarterback\" column and by author Jon Wertheim. Fourth down decisions to punt have been analyzed mathematically by David Romer.\nField goals.\nField goals are worth one point after a scored touchdown, or three points in the event that a team does not score a touchdown but feels it is positioned close enough for the kicker to make the attempt.\nKick and punt returns.\nDowning the ball.\nIf, the receiving team does not catch the ball, the kicking team may move into position and try to down it as close as possible to the opposing team's end zone. This is achieved by either catching the ball (generally when close to the end zone so as to prevent a touchback), or surrounding the ball and allowing it to roll or bounce, without touching it, as close as possible to the end zone. If the ball appears to be rolling or bouncing into the end zone, a player may run in front of the goal line and attempt to bat it down or catch it. If a member of the kicking team catches the ball before a member of the receiving team does so, the play is blown dead by the official, and the receiving team takes possession at the spot the ball was spotted by the official.\nThus it is strategically important for kicking teams to get as close to the ball as possible after a punt, so that they may quickly tackle a returner, down the ball as close to the opposing team's end zone as possible, and (if possible) recover the ball after a fumble and regain possession of the ball."

        "title": "Nightwatchman (cricket)",
        "text": "In the sport of cricket, a nightwatchman is a lower-order batter who comes in to bat higher up the order than usual near the end of the day's play. The nightwatchman's job is to maintain most of the strike until the close of play.\nThe name comes due to the goal of remaining in overnight after the end of the day, a play on words on the watchmen of public safety and law enforcement. In doing so they protect more capable batters from being out cheaply in what may be a period of tiredness or poor light at the end of the day and again the following morning when the early-morning conditions may favour the bowlers who will be refreshed from their night rest. The theory is that losing two top-order batters in quick succession would be worse than losing one top-order batter and a tailender.\nTactical consideration.\nThe role of nightwatchman is generally given to players who emphasise defensive technique over quick run-scoring, most often a bowler who would normally bat in the 8th or 9th position. There have been occasions when nightwatchmen have made a big score and six have made centuries in test matches. The nightwatchman's goal tactically is to play conservatively on the night to get through the evening and then play a more even style to score runs and turn over the strike to their batting partner. Daniel Vettori would place himself in the role on several occasions while he was the New Zealand captain. Wicket-keepers may also take on the role, Alan Knott, Wasim Bari, Ben Barnett and Ian Healy have scored half-centuries in the role.\nEven if the nightwatchman does survive until the end of the day, the beginning of the next day's play will see refreshed bowlers with better light facing a less capable batter. As a result, not all captains use the tactic. Steve Waugh abandoned the tactic during his captaincy of Australia. Furthermore, under Ben Stokes England have instead favoured the lower order batsman to play aggressively (the nighthawk). The defensive technique inherent to the role may also lead to their play being too slow for the conditions, the nightwatchman being too good to get out, but not good enough to score at the desired rate of their team. \nThe nightwatchman is not to be confused with the pinch hitter, a middle to lower order batter who is promoted up the order in limited-overs games, or in first-class games where their team is looking for a quick declaration, in the pursuit of quick runs without too much concern for their wicket.\nNightwatchmen failures.\nThe tactic has potential drawbacks. It is inherently a paradox to send out an inferior batter to attempt to survive the worst conditions a batter can face and their technique can fail them. If the nightwatchman gets out before the end of the day the batting team may need to send out a more capable batter to prevent the loss of further wickets, costing the team a wicket while negating any benefit from using the nightwatchman. In 2014 against India, the Australian side protected wicket-keeper Brad Haddin by sending out Nathan Lyon with half an hour to play. Lyon only lasted 4 overs, forcing Haddin to the crease to face a handful of overs and being dismissed on what became the final ball of the day.\nIn 2024 the Pakistan team in a match against Australia sent Sajid Khan as a nightwatchman after Saud Shakeel was dismissed by Josh Hazlewood with two overs left. This was done to protect genuine all-rounder Salman Ali Agha. The tactic failed miserably as Khan was bowled all ends up on his second ball faced. Salman then had to come out to bat anyway, and he only lasted two more balls before Hazlewood found an easily caught edge, finishing the over with a three wicket maiden.\nOpener nightwatchmen.\nIt is very rare but not unknown for a team to use nightwatchmen when an innings begins late in the day. Teams will trust in the ability of the specialist opening batsman to do their usual job of handling the new ball regardless of how difficult that might be. Australian Captain and opening batter Mark Taylor has remarked that most batters will accept a nightwatchman when asked, but as an opener he had never been offered one.\nRangana Herath opened the 2nd innings as a nightwatchman in the 1st Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in 2009 having batted at 9 in the first innings. Herath took the final 6 balls of the day with usual opening batter Malinda Warnapura at the other end. The next morning Warnapura was out caught on the second ball of the day while Herath scored 15 off 60 balls before an LBW dismissal to Younis Khan. Jack Leach who normally batted 10th or 11th opened as a nightwatchman for England in a 2019 Test match against Ireland, surviving a single over at the evening then top-scoring for the innings with 92 runs the following day with Ireland collapsing in the last innings to be all out 38 chasing 182.\nReversing the order.\nIn the days before covered wickets it was common for teams to protect the upper part of the order from a sticky wicket by reversing the batting order and hoping to exchange the inevitable loss of wickets for the time it would take for the wicket to start playing better. Although not necessarily done late in the day, the reversed order effectively turned the promoted part of the order into nightwatchmen for the upper half. Don Bradman once scored 270 not out as the #7 batsman after such a reversal, with Bill O'Reilly and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith opening the batting and being dismissed for 0 runs each. It was the only time either opened the batting in their Test career.\nTest centuries by nightwatchmen.\nThere have been six test centuries by nightwatchmen (), as recognised by ESPNcricinfo:\nThere has been debate about whether Nasim-ul-Ghani (who later opened in a Test) and wicketkeeper Boucher were genuine nightwatchmen – however, in the matches in question they both came in at No. 6, at the end of the day, ahead of more recognised batsmen, and Cricinfo considers them to have been nightwatchmen.\nAlex Tudor (of England) was close to making a century as a nightwatchman; he made 99 not out against New Zealand in 1999 at Edgbaston, and was stranded one run short of his maiden test century when Graham Thorpe got the total to the point where a boundary was needed for the win with Tudor being on 95 runs, needing a six to reach his century. Tudor then hit the winning runs with a four, leaving him on 99*.\nAlso close was Harold Larwood. In the final Test of the 1932–33 Ashes, Larwood made 98 as a nightwatchman, the highest innings made in the role up to that time as well as the highest Test score Larwood would make in his career."

        "title": "World Cricket Tsunami Appeal",
        "text": "The World Cricket Tsunami Appeal was an effort by the International Cricket Council to raise funds to support the humanitarian relief efforts following the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004. It was scheduled to be held over two games but was reduced to one due to an over-crowded international playing schedule and concerns for players' health playing in the April heat in Kolkata. The match was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 10 January 2005.\nThe tsunami affected several leading cricketing nations. India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh were the affected Test match playing nations, as were Malaysia, Thailand, the Maldives and Indonesia among the other associate &amp; affiliate members of the ICC.\nOne-Day Internationals.\nThe centrepiece of world cricket's efforts to support the victims of the tsunami was to have been a two-match one-day series between a World XI and an Asian XI. The first of these games was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia on 10 January 2005. The match was telecast in at least 122 countries. The second was to be held in Kolkata, India, originally scheduled for 13 February, but on 28 January 2005 the ICC announced it would instead be played in the second half of April. The second match was cancelled on 28 February.\nTravelex sponsored the first match, which was a 78,000 sell-out, for A$1 million. Two C-130H Hercules aircraft, similar to those used by the Royal Australian Air Force to carry supplies to regions devastated by the massive earthquake and resulting tsunamis, flew over the MCG during the break between innings. The first ODI, which the World XI won by 112 runs, raised approximately A$17 million, while original estimations suggested only A$5 million would be raised from the Australians.\nThe games were designated as One Day Internationals by the ICC, the first time a game between teams not representing separate cricketing nations was so designated. This designation attracted criticism from cricket statisticians.\nTeams for the first ODI.\nWorld XI squad: \nMatch officials.\nThe onfield umpires were Rudi Koertzen (SA) and Billy Bowden (NZ). Chris Broad (Eng) was the match referee. Bob Parry (Aus) was the TV umpire. All the match officials gave their services unpaid.\nOn 7 January 2005 five of the World XI players, Darren Gough, Chris Cairns, Daniel Vettori, Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo sent messages of hope and called on cricket fans to support the Appeal.\nFirst ODI.\nWorld XI innings.\nWorld XI captain Ponting won the toss and chose to bat, a decision which looked to have backfired early when opener Chris Gayle was caught behind off Zaheer Khan for only 1. Big hitting Adam Gilchrist (24) hit the first six of the match, which by itself earned A$50,000 for the appeal courtesy of Toyota.\nGilchrist was himself caught behind off Zaheer shortly thereafter. The ensuing Ponting/Brian Lara partnership saw both players reach half-centuries, with Lara's 50 coming in 76 balls, a relatively slow speed compared with the power-hitting to be seen later. Lara was dismissed for 52, due to a well-taken Chaminda Vaas catch in the deep off Anil Kumble. Ponting, who was closing in on his century, was then forced to play second-fiddle to a whirlwind innings by New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns, who at one point had contributed more than 40 runs off a 60 run partnership. Kumble bore the brunt of this attack, with several balls disappearing into the crowd for 6. Cairns also contributed the shot of the match, a straight-driven 6 off Muttiah Muralitharan from halfway down the pitch.\nPonting's century was the cue for him to cut loose, hitting two consecutive 6s before being stumped off Kumble. This resulted in the surprising appearance of professional tailender Glenn McGrath at number 6 on the back of his \"brilliant\" 61 against New Zealand earlier that summer–ahead of both Stephen Fleming and Australian opener Matthew Hayden. Commentators were barely able to keep straight faces as \"the newest all-rounder in world cricket\" attempted to slog Muralitharan for 6 on the first ball, unfortunately misjudging the spin of the delivery and being easily caught by Yousuf Youhana.\nCairns completed his blazing 50 and became even more cavalier with his wicket, eventually being stumped off Muralitharan as well, but the damage had already been done with the World XI looking at a score well above 300. Stephen Fleming contributed a quickfire 30, losing batting partner Hayden for only 2 (stumped off Muralitharan again), before being clean bowled by Vaas. The final over featured a partnership between spinners Daniel Vettori (27 not out) and Shane Warne (2 not out), with Warne's comeback to limited-overs cricket being greeting rapturously by the fans.\nThe innings ended on a somewhat farcical note, as Warne miscounted the number of balls left in the final over and began leaving the field with Vaas having one delivery left. Rising to the occasion, umpire Bowden issued Warne with a \"yellow card\", to cheers from the crowd. Warne was recalled to the wicket and the World XI finished with a total of 344 for 8. As match sponsors Travelex were pledging a donation of A$1,000 per run, and Toyota A$50,000 for each for the six sixes, the World XI had earned A$644,000.\nAsian XI innings.\nThe ACC Asian XI were faced with the challenge of rewriting history, since no team had made a successful run chase of 345 in cricket history (the highest total in 50-over ODI's successfully chased – at the time – being 326 runs). Openers Jayasuriya, whose mother had been injured in the tsunami, and Sehwag made a good start, with Sehwag hitting another 6, but the introduction of Cairns into the attack proved Jayasuriya's undoing, with the Sri Lankan (28) captain edging a soft catch to Fleming at first slip. The next wickets all fell to spin, with Warne claiming Sehwag (48) via a boundary catch by Gayle. The dismissal was almost a carbon-copy of the way in which Sehwag fell in the Boxing Day Test of 2003.\nVettori was able to get Sourav Ganguly (22) to hit an easy catch to Darren Gough at mid-off, while Yousuf Youhana fell for just 4 as Ponting took another catch off Warne's bowling. The partnership between Rahul Dravid (71 not out) and keeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara (24) was seen as potentially a ray of hope, as both men were capable of remaining calm and playing shots, however Sangakkara edged a Gough delivery to Gilchrist. Pakistani all-rounder Abdul Razzaq (11) began promisingly, but became another victim of the desire to raise the scoring rate, being stumped by Gilchrist off Vettori.\nThe tail provided only sporadic resistance, with Vaas (7) being caught by Gayle off Vettori. Zaheer Khan (0) achieved the unwanted distinction of being run out without facing a ball as he fell to a well-executed Chris Gayle throw.\nSteve Waugh, the World XI coach/manager also came onto the field for a spot of fielding. Wild cheers erupted whenever he fielded the ball; a brilliant diving save showed that he could still play despite a year out of the international arena.\nKumble (11) held on for 7 balls before \"all-rounder\" McGrath finally claimed his only wicket for the match, clean-bowling him. Gayle was given the job of bowling the 40th over, which featured a moment of indecision by Rahul Dravid as Vettori swooped on the ball, while Dravid was able to avoid being run out, his batting partner Muralitharan – running to the danger end – was not so lucky and fell for a duck, completing the Asian XI's innings of 232.\nWith one six in the innings, the ACC Asian XI had won A$282,000 from the sponsors, bringing the total being paid by Travelex and Toyota for the teams' performances to A$926,000.\nDesignated charity.\nMoney from the match went to World Vision International, a charity that helps children and their communities worldwide.\nMedia coverage.\nIn Australia, the game was televised on the Nine Network (and its regional affiliates – WIN and NBN networks), and on ABC Local Radio. The game was broadcast to 122 countries. In the United Kingdom the game was being shown live on Sky Sports Xtra.\nOther fundraising.\nCricket also engaged in other fundraising efforts.\nNew Zealand vs FICA World XI one-day series.\nNotable among these was a series of three one-day matches in late January between New Zealand and a FICA World XI. Unlike the World XI vs Asian XI matches, these three games were not granted official status as One-Day Internationals.\nAt the time of the tsunami, the Sri Lankan national team was touring New Zealand (the two sides were at the time ranked second and third in the world in one-day cricket). The departure of the team not only saw a desperate need for fundraising, but also saw the New Zealand team faced with an absence of an international cricket series. In order to fill the gap in the schedule and provide more funds for disaster relief, a series was hastily arranged between the New Zealand national team and a team drawn from top international players from overseas, captained by Australia's Shane Warne.\nThe three matches raised a total of $NZ 1,088,563 ($US 772,000).\nThe first match.\nThe first match, at Jade Stadium, Christchurch on 21 January 2005, was a one-sided match. The world team batted first and lost early wickets. At one stage they were reduced to 20 for the loss of four wickets, before a partnership by Graeme Hick and Jonty Rhodes helped the team a less embarrassing, yet still low, total of 158. Any fear that spectators would not get their money's-worth from a truncated match were soon allayed by an astonishing innings from New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, who bludgeoned the bowling in scoring 106 from just 57 deliveries, including nine sixes and ten fours. Muttiah Muralitharan, arguably the world's best spin bowler, came in for most of the punishment, being hit for seven sixes in just three overs. New Zealand reached the winning total for the loss of only one wicket.\nFirst match\nThe second match.\nThe second match was a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a big score, finishing on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but less than they would have wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total was never going to be enough, however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.\nSecond match\nThe third match.\nThe third match was somewhat disappointing. It was played at Westpac Trust Park, Hamilton, on 26 January. The World XI struggled to deal with a variable pitch, and were bowled out for 81 in 20.5 overs. Nick Knight scored 43, but the rest of the batsmen fell quickly. Chris Cairns took 6 for 12 and Jeff Wilson 3 for 6. The New Zealand batsmen did not find conditions much easier, as Ian Harvey took 4 for 17, but managed to reach 83 for 6 in the 16th over, winning the series 2–1.\nTo compensate the crowd for the unusually short game, the players agreed to play a 10 over-a-side match later in the day. More than 30 sixes were hit, as the game finished in a tie with both sides scoring 178.\nThird match\nMCC vs International XI (14 June).\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC) won by 112 runs\nIn a charity match at Lord's, Brian Lara came to regret the decision to bowl first, although the match was hardly to be taken seriously. Andy Flower, the old Zimbabwe stalwart, made a quickfire 55 near the end of the innings, Stephen Fleming smashed some lovely cover drives on his way to a 46-ball fifty before edging Makhaya Ntini to third man for 62, and Jacques Kallis also made 62 as he paired up well with VVS Laxman. The deep batting order, aided by Lara's willingness to utilise his bowlers – the pick of the International XI, Chaminda Vaas, who utilised the English conditions as he took two for 19, only got to bowl seven overs, while Lara himself bowled two and the International XI used all their available bowlers – and the MCC made 327 for 7.\nIn reply, the International XI got off to a blazing start, as Sanath Jayasuriya and Graeme Smith lifted them to 65 for 1 after ten overs. With Lara coming in at four and looking settled, things looked good, but the wheels fell off in their chase of the massive total. Lara charged Anil Kumble to Shoaib Akhtar for 42, no other International batsman passed 20, and the team crumbled to 189 for 7 – Smith stumped for 68. Chris Gayle redeemed his poor batting effort by removing the tail, and the International XI were all out for 215. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nAsia vs Rest of the World Twenty20 match.\nSurrey County Cricket Club hosted a Twenty20 game between Asia and the Rest of the World in aid of the tsunami appeal on 20 June 2005 at the Oval. The game won approval from the England and Wales Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council. The Asia XI won the toss and decided to bat, but the International XI won by 6 wickets with Australian Greg Blewett declared man of the match for his innings of 91 not out. The match attracted a crowd of 23,000 and raised £1.1 million.\nICC report\nBBC match report"

        "title": "The Swimming-Pool Library",
        "text": "The Swimming-Pool Library is a 1988 novel by Alan Hollinghurst.\nPlot introduction.\nIn 1983 London, Will, a privileged, gay, sexually irresistible 25-year-old, saves the life of an elderly aristocrat who has a heart-attack in a public lavatory. This chance meeting ultimately requires Will to re-evaluate his sense of the past and his family's history.\nPlot summary.\nWilliam Beckwith is a highly privileged, cultivated and promiscuous young gay man. He is the grandson and heir of Viscount Beckwith, an elder statesman and a recent peer. To avoid death duties, that grandfather has already settled most of his estate on Will, who therefore has substantial private means and no need of work.\nAs the novel opens, Will is currently seeing a young, working-class, black man named Arthur. Will is deeply sexual and physically very attractive. His preoccupation with Arthur is almost entirely physical.\nWill is a member of the Corinthian Club (‘the Corry’) at which he swims, exercises and cruises men. The Corry is in no formal sense a gay club, indeed it is made clear that there are non-gay members, but there is a pervasive homoerotic atmosphere.\nWhilst cruising a young man in a London park, Will enters a public toilet to find a group of older men cottaging. One of them suddenly suffers what is perhaps a minor heart attack and collapses. Will applies artificial respiration and saves the man's life. He returns home to find Arthur bleeding and terrified. Arthur has accidentally killed a friend of his brother Harold's, after an argument about drugs. Will agrees to shelter Arthur.\nAt the Corry, Will meets the old man again and learns that he is Lord (Charles) Nantwich. Charles invites Will to lunch at Wicks': his club. Wicks' is filled with men \"of fantastic seniority\". Will studied history at Oxford, getting a 2.1 rather than the first that he says had been expected of him.\nTrapped in close confinement with Arthur, Will begins to resent him. Their boredom and tension occasionally erupts in bouts of sex. Will goes to a cinema that shows gay pornography and has anonymous sex. On the train home, Will reads \"Valmouth\", a novel by Ronald Firbank, given to him by his best friend, James. James is a hard-working doctor who is insecure and sexually frustrated as a gay man. The novel by Firbank echoes themes central to \"The Swimming-Pool Library\"; secrets and discretion; extreme old age, colonialism, race and camp; the sense of deeper truths residing behind a thin façade of artifice.\nBack at the flat, William finds his small nephew Rupert, an enchantingly self-possessed boy of six, who has run away from home. Rupert loves Will and is interested in homosexuality. Despite his youth, Rupert exhibits a strong gay sensibility. Will calls his sister Philippa and her husband Gavin comes to collect Rupert. While they're waiting, Will and Rupert look at a photo album containing photos of a young Will and members of his family. Will goes to the Corry with James; on their return, Arthur has vanished.\nWill visits Charles at his home, where he lives with his servant Lewis. Lewis is curt, even slightly aggressive and seems jealously protective of Nantwich. Charles's house is filled with memorabilia and books; there are homoerotic paintings as well as a portrait of a beautiful African boy. In the cellar, they look at some Roman mosaics and Charles asks Will to write his biography for him.\nAt the Corry, Will is attracted to Phil, a young bodybuilder. Despite his physique, Phil is shy and a sexual novice. Will suspects that Phil is the man with whom he had sex in the cinema.\nJames believes that Will is wasting his intelligence and his literary skill and urges him to write Charles's biography. Will returns to Charles's house to find him locked in his bedroom by Lewis. Their master/servant relationship is complex and fraught. Will takes Charles’ diaries and notes home.\nOn the train, Will cruises a young man whom he takes home; they engage in sexual intercourse. He begins to read Charles's papers.\nCharles's early life vividly illustrates themes central to the experience of being homosexual, privileged and British. Will reads of his boyhood at public school, where he experienced sexuality by turns brutal and tender. He is cruelly raped by one boy but later taken under the protection of an older boy, Strong, who treats him gently. Strong became a soldier in the Great War, was badly injured and died insane. Charles becomes aware that he is strongly attracted to black men when he is openly propositioned by an American soldier. He experiences feelings of desperate arousal, fear and revulsion, and flees.\nAs a student, Charles goes on a spree with some friends in the country. They go to an abandoned hunting lodge and drink champagne. Charles has sex with one of them; a young man who feels insecure about his (comparatively) modest background and sexual inexperience.\nAs a young man, Charles enters the Foreign Service and travels to Sudan to act as a regional administrator. He is enchanted by the land and powerfully drawn to African men but finds himself cut off by race, rank and position. Charles ruminates on the sense of devotion that homosexuality can foster between men and how that devotion aids duty and right action.\nPhil invites Will back to his lodgings in the hotel where Phil works as a waiter. Phil wants sex but is too shy so Will seduces him.\nWill goes to the opera with James and his grandfather. The opera is \"Billy Budd\". Will is struck almost to tears by the homoerotic and emotional power of the work. During the conversation afterwards, the subject of Benjamin Britten’s own homosexuality arises and they talk about his relationship with E. M. Forster, who co-wrote the libretto. The relationship between gay sexual expression and art is gently explored.\nWill continues reading Charles's diaries. On the way to a boxing club financially supported by Nantwich, Will has an unpleasant encounter with a working class boy, who offers him sex for money. Will refuses; there are undertones of fear and violence.\nAt the match, Will meets Bill: a man he knows from the Corry. Bill is a weightlifter; a large muscular man who coaches teenage boxers. Trapped inside his body, Bill seems a fearful man. He is devoted to Nantwich, his patron, and to the boys he coaches. He is also carrying a torch for Phil.\nFrom the diaries, Will learns that Nantwich has been to Egypt and then returned to London, where he met with Ronald Firbank: an extraordinary portrait of effete decrepitude, camp and alcoholic.\nWill takes Phil to visit Staines, a successful studio photographer who echoes Cecil Beaton. Staines is a gossipy queen and socialite. His lover is a \"school tart\" grown old; a kept man drinking too much. Staines poses Phil bare-chested and oiled, as pornography. This episode overtly deals with gay artifice, staging and the image. Phil is idealised and objectified. Staines reveals that Charles's brother was homosexually insatiable, exploited his servants and was subsequently beaten to death and that Charles's uncle was likewise into rough trade.\nAt Nantwich's house, Will and Charles talk about Ronald Firbank. Charles gives Will a beautiful edition of one of Firbank's novels as a gift. Afterwards, Will goes to Arthur's address in a working class area of London and calls but there is no answer. Returning, he encounters a group of skinheads who demand his watch, attack and queer-bash him, destroying the Firbank novel in the process. Will goes home, where James patches him up but beauty is temporarily ruined. He reads Charles's diary aloud to Phil: Charles describes a North African trying to covertly sell him gay pornography and is disturbed at being ‘outed’ in a foreign culture.\nWill returns to Staines's home with Nantwich. There are several other men there, including two youths and a black chef, Abdul, who works at Charles's club. Will is powerfully attracted to Abdul. It transpires that Staines and Nantwich are collaborating on the production of a pornographic film in which Abdul and the two youths are performing. The theme of voyeurism alienates Will, who finds it embarrassing and quietly leaves.\nWill takes Phil out clubbing at The Shaft. He has not been there for many months and there are vivid descriptions of a night on the gay ‘scene’. Will and Phil drink, dance and meet several gay ‘types’, including a Brazilian bodybuilder. He discovers Arthur, who has been working for his brother Harold, in the bathroom and attempts to have sex with him. Arthur is obviously quite upset, and they part ways.\nWill gets a telephone call from James; he has been arrested whilst seeking sex. This is ironic since James's sex-life is non-eventful compared to Will's. It appears to be a case of police-entrapment, with an undercover officer soliciting sex from homosexual men.\nCharles's diaries have entered the Second World War; he is entering middle-age and the tone is melancholy. He is passionately devoted to an African man; the beautiful boy whose portrait hangs in Charles's house. The boy is now grown and soon to marry.\nWill goes to an exhibition of photographs by Staines. The theme is soft-core homo-erotica. He is surprised to find Gavin there. Talking with Staines, he discovers that he and Charles have produced three pornographic films of the type that play in the cinema where Will first had sex with Phil.\nFrom the diaries, Will learns how Charles's life was ruined. The African man whom he loved gets married and Charles begins to visit anonymous sex clubs and cruisy bathrooms. One night he solicits a policeman, who arrests Charles for public indecency. Despite his rank, Charles is ruthlessly prosecuted by a conservative politician of the time, who wants to make an example of him. The politician is William's grandfather; now the Viscount Beckwith. Will's wealth, his rank and his leisured gay existence are all built on a foundation of homosexual persecution. He also learns that Charles and Bill met in prison, where Bill, then a young man, had been thrown for having a love-affair with a boy three years younger than himself. The theme of natural love and sexuality destroyed by elite oppression is very powerful. While Charles is in prison, he learns that Taha, the African man, has been beaten to death in an incident that is apparently racially motivated. After learning about his grandfather's past, Will decides that he cannot now write Charles's biography, nor was he intended to do so. Charles has been educating him on his own past.\nWill talks on the phone with Gavin, his brother in law. Gavin tells Will that he knew it was Will's grandfather who imprisoned Charles. A past perhaps so distant that the archaeologist knows it where the historian does not.\nRupert has been told to watch out for Arthur; he reports that he has seen him with his brother Harold.\nWill goes to Phil's hotel. He encounters a rich Argentine who propositions him. Will accepts until he finds that the man is obsessed with gay pornographic conventions, costumes and sex toys. Will finds this all slightly ridiculous and is not aroused. He refuses to consent to sex and leaves.\nUpstairs, he discovers Phil having sex with Bill. Disoriented, he leaves and wanders to James's and then the Corry, where Charles Nantwich reveals his designs in giving Will the diaries. Will and James go to Staines's to see a film, not a piece of pornography but an archive recording of Ronald Firbank in old age. The novel closes.\nReception.\n\"The Swimming-Pool Library\" won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1988, and the E. M. Forster Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1989.\nIn 1988, Edmund White called it, \"surely the best book about gay life yet written by an English author.\""

        "title": "Unofficial Football World Championships",
        "text": "The Unofficial Football World Championships (UFWC) is an informal way of calculating the world's best international association football team, using a knock-out title system similar to that used in professional boxing. The UFWC was formalized by contributors to the Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) in 2002 and published by English journalist Paul Brown in a 2003 \"FourFourTwo\" article. Brown created a web page for the UFWC, and both this and the RSSSF tracked the progression of the championship. \nThe title is currently held by Ivory Coast who won it from Uruguay on 26 March 2024.\nBackground.\nThe idea stemmed originally from some Scotland fans and sections of the media jokingly asserting that as they beat England (who had won the 1966 World Cup) in a British Home Championship match on 15 April 1967—England's first loss after their FIFA World Cup victory—they were the \"Unofficial World Champions\".\nIn 2002, football statisticians James Allnutt, Paul Crankshaw, Jostein Nygård, and Roberto Di Maggio defined the rules of the UFWC, traced its lineage and published it on the Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation website. The following year, freelance journalist Paul Brown wrote an article on the UFWC in football magazine \"FourFourTwo\". In 2011, Brown authored a book on the subject. Brown also created the championship's website which tracked its progression up until 2022.\nThe UFWC is not sanctioned by FIFA, nor does it have any sort of official backing.\nTracking the Championship.\nWhile the Unofficial Football World Championship was invented in 2002, the rules are such that results are analysed retrospectively to determine the theoretical lineage of champions from the very first international matches. A comprehensive list of results of all championship games is maintained on the UFWC website.\nEarly international football.\nThe first ever FIFA-recognised international match was a 0–0 draw between England and Scotland, on 30 November 1872 at Hamilton Crescent. The Unofficial World Championship thus remained vacant until the same two teams met again at the Kennington Oval on 8 March 1873. England won 4–2, and so are regarded as having become the inaugural Unofficial Football World Champions.\nEarly international football was almost entirely confined to the British Isles. Wales entered the UFWC 'competition' in 1876—holding it for the first time in 1907, and Ireland (the team representing the Belfast-based Irish Football Association, subsequently known as Northern Ireland) in 1882—first recording a UFWC victory in 1927. The UFWC title swapped between the Home Nations teams several times in this period, and was first competed by a non-British Isles team in 1909, when England defeated Hungary in Budapest.\nThe fact that none of the Home Nations teams competed in the 1930, 1934, or 1938 World Cups kept the title from travelling too far abroad, and the First and Second World Wars hindered football's globalization process further.\n1930s–2000s.\nIt was 1931 when the title was first passed outside the British Isles, to Austria in their third attempt with a 5–0 victory over Scotland. They held the title until 7 December 1932 when they lost 4–3 to England at Stamford Bridge, and for all but the last few months of the decade it was held by those four teams. In the 1940s, the title was held by continental teams, notably those representing the Axis powers and countries neutral during World War II, but was recaptured by England in time for the 1950 World Cup. Here, in a shock result, they lost to the United States in one of the biggest upsets ever; it was the first venture of the title onto the Americas, and stayed there because Chile immediately took it with their win in the last game of the group stage which wasn't enough to qualify for the later stages. This made 1950 both the first World Cup where the title was at stake and not captured by the winners. It remained in the Americas for all but one of the following 16 years.\nThis time included the four-day reign of Netherlands Antilles, who beat Mexico 2–1 in a CONCACAF Championship match to become the smallest country ever to hold the title.\nThe UFWC returned to Europe in time for the 1966 FIFA World Cup with the Soviet Union. They lost the championship in the semi-final to West Germany, who lost the final to England. The following year, the England v Scotland match of 1967, which first gave rise to the idea of an unofficial world championship, really was a UFWC title match. With West Germany's victory over Netherlands in the 1974 World Cup Final, West Germany became the first team to hold the World Cup, European Championship and the UFWC at the same time. The title stayed in Europe until 1978, when it was taken by Argentina, the winners of the 1978 World Cup. It remained in South America until the 1982 World Cup where Peru lost to Poland. The UFWC remained in Europe for the next ten years, except for a one-year tenure by Argentina.\nIn 1992, the title returned to the United States and then was held for one match by Australia, before it worked its way through several South American nations, back through Europe and to its first Asian holders, South Korea, who defeated Colombia in the 1995 Carlsberg Cup semi-final. The Koreans lost the title to FR Yugoslavia in their next match, and the UFWC remained in Europe until March 1998 when Germany lost it to Brazil in a friendly. Argentina then defeated Brazil in a friendly to carry the UFWC into the 1998 World Cup.\nFrance repeated Argentina's 1978 feat by taking the title as they won the World Cup on home turf, beating Brazil 3–0 in the final. England took the title for the last time to date at UEFA Euro 2000. France and Spain enjoyed spells as champions before the Netherlands won the title in March 2002. As the Dutch had failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the UFWC was, unusually, not at stake at the official World Cup. The Netherlands retained the title until 10 September 2003, when they lost a Euro 2004 qualifier 3–1 to the Czech Republic.\n2004–2010.\nThe Czechs defended their title a few times, before losing it to the Republic of Ireland in a friendly via a last-minute winner by Robbie Keane. The title then went to an African nation for the first time, as they lost it to Nigeria. Angola won and kept this title through late 2004 and early 2005. They were then beaten by Zimbabwe (in a match that tripled as a World Cup qualifier and an African Nations qualifier), who held the title for six months before Nigeria re-gained it in October 2005. Nigeria were beaten by Romania, who lost it to Uruguay within six months. Uruguay became the highest ranked team to hold the title since 2004, but their failure to qualify for the World Cup finals meant that, for the second time in succession, the unofficial title was not available at the official championships.\nThe title was brought back to Europe by Georgia on 15 November 2006, with both goals scored by Levan Kobiashvili in a 2–0 victory. They lost the title to the highest ranked team in the UFWC of all time, Scotland, on 24 March 2007, nearly forty years since Scotland had last gained the title. Just four days later, Scotland conceded the title 2–0 to FIFA World Cup holders Italy, and the title passed through the hands of Hungary twice, Turkey, Greece and Sweden before being claimed by the Netherlands, who eventually lost the title to Spain in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final after a run that saw more successful defences than any other reign with 21.\n2010–present.\nThe European sojourn of the title was brought to an end when Argentina beat Spain 4–1 in a September 2010 friendly, and after beating the Argentines in a friendly, Japan brought the title to the Asian Cup for the first time in 2011, and remained unbeaten throughout the tournament. Scheduled defenses of the title were cancelled after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and they held the title for over a year before relinquishing it to North Korea, ranked 124th in the world by FIFA, the lowest ranking of a UFWC champion since the rankings were introduced in 1993. North Korea continued to hold title through their successful campaign in the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup, where low-ranked nations Philippines, Tajikistan, India, Palestine, and Turkmenistan challenged, the last of whom almost pulled off a major upset. North Korea's reign was memorable for the fact that so many low-ranking teams challenged to become holders of the crown – as well as the aforementioned AFC Challenge Cup, low ranking nations competing in the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup second preliminary round such as Kuwait, Indonesia, Chinese Taipei, Guam, and Hong Kong all unsuccessfully attempted to take the title away from North Korea.\nThe title was finally taken from North Korea by Sweden in the 2013 King's Cup, a result not recorded as a full international by FIFA, but nevertheless considered valid by the UFWC website. In a friendly in February, Sweden were beaten by Argentina who took the title to South America. In October, Argentina lost a FIFA World Cup qualifier to Uruguay.\nUruguay took the UFWC into Group D of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nDuring the group-stage an already-eliminated England challenged Costa Rica for the UFWC in their third group-stage game and the UFWC was mooted as a potential consolation prize in the British press, however the match was drawn and Costa Rica took the UFWC into the knockout phase.\nThe UFWC and World Cup were \"unified\", with Germany securing both in the final.\nShortly after the World Cup, the runners-up Argentina beat Germany in a friendly to claim the UFWC title. This reign ended one match later, when Brazil won the UFWC title after winning 2014 Superclásico de las Américas.\nBrazil held onto the title to take it into the 2015 Copa América, where it ended up with tournament winners Chile. Chile lost the title to Uruguay who took it into the Copa América Centenario, but regained it before winning the tournament. The UFWC was exchanged between CONMEBOL sides during 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, and remained in South America despite being contested by outside teams during Chile's successful 2017 China Cup campaign. Ultimately it was Peru took the Championship into the 2018 World Cup where the title ended with tournament victors France.\nFor the next four years, the title was traded between UEFA teams, with most matches being either Euro 2020 qualifying, UEFA Nations League and World Cup 2022 qualifying games. In terms of number of consecutive title defenses, the 2020–2021 streak by Italy, which included their victorious UEFA Euro 2020 campaign, was the joint longest in UFWC history (tied with the Netherlands in 2008–2010). The 2022 World Cup ended with victors Argentina also holding the 2021 Copa América and the UFWC, before losing the title to Uruguay during 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying.\nAll-time rankings.\nThe UFWC website maintained an all-time ranking table of teams, sorting by number of championship matches won. Owing mostly to their successes in the early years of international football, where competition was almost entirely limited to the British Isles, the top ranked team is Scotland.\nUFWC at major championships.\nDue to the nature of group stages, a team may win or retain the UFWC without qualifying for the knock-out stages of a competition. If, on the other hand, the UFWC champion reaches the knock-out stage, then the title of that competition will be unified with the UFWC.\nGlobal.\nFIFA World Cup.\nNo team has ever successfully defended the unofficial world championship title through a World Cup Finals. The Netherlands have come closest, remaining unbeaten in both the 1974 and 2010 competitions right up until the final, where they lost to West Germany and Spain respectively. West Germany were also beaten finalists in 1986, but the title changed hands four times during the tournament.\nBy necessity, each time the UFWC holder makes it to the knockout stage of a FIFA World Cup, a reunion of the two titles occurs, since the knockout format ensures that the UFWC trophy will be handed on throughout the games into the final. There it will be won by the team which also wins the World Cup. It is, however, possible that the UFWC holder is eliminated in the group stage of the World Cup and leaves the tournament as reigning UFWC champion, in which case no reunion occurs; this happened to Chile in 1950, Mexico in 1962 and Colombia in 1994.\nContinental.\nThe championships of each of the continental championships are only listed when the UFWC was contested during the tournament. The continental championships of Africa and Oceania have not yet seen competition for this title.\nBook.\nFreelance journalist Paul Brown, who wrote the original FourFourTwo article on the UFWC and created the UFWC website, wrote a book on the championship which was published by Superelastic in 2011. Written in English, it has also been translated into Japanese. , four editions of the book have been published, with the latest UFWC developments added to each.\nSimilar concepts.\nThe concept of such a title is not unique to the UFWC, similar concepts, with different rules and therefore different lineages, are discussed below.\nUFWC Spin-offs.\nThe online community at the UFWC website tracked UFWC-like lineages confined to each FIFA confederation and a Women's Unofficial Football World Championships which could be traced back either to the first FIFA-recognised women's international in 1971 (a 4–0 victory for France over The Netherlands) or to earlier internationals that are not FIFA recognised.\nNasazzi's Baton and Netto's Baton.\nA similar virtual title, Nasazzi's Baton, traces the \"championship\" from the first World Cup winners Uruguay, after whose captain it is named. Nasazzi's Baton follows the same rules as the UFWC, except that it treats all matches according to their result after 90 minutes. Another virtual title, Netto's Baton, follows the same rules but is traced from the first UEFA European Championship winners Soviet Union and is confined to UEFA member national teams.\nVirtual World Championship.\nAnother virtual title, the Virtual World Championship, operates along the same boxing-style lines but only counts matches in FIFA-recognised championships and their qualifying stages. This title is traced from the 1908 Olympic Games, and treats all matches according to their result after 90 minutes. Olympic competitions since 1936 are not considered, as full international teams ceased to take part after that tournament.\nPound for Pound World Championship.\nAnother similar competition, the Pound for Pound World Championship (PPWC), was created by Scottish football magazine \"The Away End\". This title only recognises competitive games, although it recognises many unofficial tournaments which are considered to be friendlies by FIFA. As with the UFWC, extra time and penalties are taken into account in defining the winner of a match. It only counts games from as far back as the first FIFA World Cup in 1930, and states that no matter who holds the title of Pound for Pound World Champion they must relinquish the crown at the beginning of every World Cup finals. At the end of the tournament the World Cup winners are crowned the new Pound for Pound World Champions. Therefore, the tournament is \"reset\" every four years."

He also played for the St. Louis Browns (1951–52), Chicago White Sox (1953) and Washington Senators (1953). Byrne batted and threw left-handed.\nEducation and military service.\nByrne attended the Baltimore City College high school and Wake Forest College. In November 1943, Byrne was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy and was stationed at Naval Training Station Norfolk, Virginia. In 1944, he reported to the destroyer USS Ordronaux (DD-617) to serve as the gunnery officer, with a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea during World War II.\nBaseball career.\nByrne was a hard-thrower pitcher who never hesitated to pitch inside, but he had struggled with his control most of his career, earning him the nickname \"Wild Man\".\nAfter making his debut on April 27, 1943, he had four years with more than 130 innings pitched and more than 6 walks per nine innings, a record later tied by Nolan Ryan. Byrne led the league in hit batsmen five times and in walks three times. Despite his wildness, he won 15 games twice (1949–50) and enjoyed a career season in with a 16–5 record and a 3.15 earned run average, and led the league in winning percentage (.762).\nBut Byrne was a dangerous hitter. He hit well enough during his career to be called on by his managers for pinch-hitting duties. He batted .238 in his career (143-for-601) with 14 home runs and 98 runs batted in during 377 games, including two grand slams.\nIn a 13-year career, Byrne posted an 85–69 record with a 4.11 earned run average in 1362 innings. He had a disappointing 0.74 strikeout-to-walk ratio (766-to-1037). In four World Series, he went 2–2 with 11 strikeouts and a 2.53 earned run average in innings. He made the American League All-Star team in . He played his final regular-season game on September 21, 1957, before ending his career in the World Series defeat to the Milwaukee Braves.\nLater life.\nAfter the conclusion of his baseball career, Byrne returned to Wake Forest, North Carolina, where he had attended college (although the college had since relocated to Winston-Salem). Prior to the 1963 season, he joined the New York Mets organization as a minor league scout. When Clyde McCullough was promoted to the Mets as a coach, Byrne took over the manager's job for the Raleigh Mets of the Carolina League. He managed the team from July 29 through the end of the season.\nByrne later became mayor of Wake Forest from 1973 through 1987. He died on December 20, 2007, at age 87 in Wake Forest, North Carolina, eleven days before his 88th birthday."

        "text": "Simon Marcus Taylor (born 17 August 1979) is a Scottish retired professional rugby union footballer who played for Bath Rugby, Stade Français and Edinburgh Rugby. He played as a back-row forward, usually a number eight. He played for Edinburgh for six seasons between 2000 and 2006 and in 2007 agreed a three-year deal with Stade Français joining them immediately after the 2007 World Cup. In the summer of 2010, Taylor signed for Bath Rugby in the English Aviva Premiership. He also represented Scotland and the British and Irish Lions. At the start of his rugby career, he played for Heriot's Former Pupils.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nBorn in Stirling, Taylor represented Scottish Schools in 1995–96 while he was at Morrison's Academy, and he went on to play for Scotland’s under-18, under-19, and under-21 teams. He had two seasons in the under-19 team, leading the Scots in the Junior World Championship in France in 1998.\nAfter five matches for the national under-21 side in 1998–1999 he went on to play in ten more under-21 internationals in 1999–2000, including the victory over the New Zealand Youth at Jedburgh in December and the draw with Australia during the 2000 Southern Hemisphere Alliance tournament in New Zealand. In that latter match Taylor scored a try. In 1999–2000 he played a pivotal role in Heriot's FP’s second successive club championship and was rewarded with a professional contract with Edinburgh Reivers at the beginning of season 2000–2001.\n2000–2003.\nTaylor made his first appearance for Scotland in the November 2000 Autumn Test against the USA. In summer 2001 he made a try-scoring debut for the British &amp; Irish Lions in their 116–10 victory over Western Australia before a knee injury unfortunately ended his tour and he returned to Scotland to pass the final exams of his law degree at the University of Edinburgh.\nHe scored his first test try in the match against Canada on the 2002 tour in which he started at openside flanker and then made some pile-driving contributions when he was fielded at No 8 against the USA. He scored his first try in a Murrayfield Test match in Scotland’s 30–22 March 2003 win against Wales. He was named Lloyds TSB Man of the Match for his display against Italy in the 29–12 Scotland victory in February 2002.\nOn 26 May 2002, Taylor was selected to play for the Barbarians against England. He scored twice, but England won 53 to 29.\nAt the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Taylor was a member of the Scottish Sevens squad who won the Men's Bowl Competition Quarter Finals.\nTaylor was named The Famous Grouse Scotland Player of the Season for 2002–2003, fitting reward for performances encapsulated by his heroic defensive contribution to the game against England when he made 23 tackles.\nIn the 2003 World Cup he started in every match.\n2004.\nTaylor suffered a serious knee injury in the final game of the Six Nations in Ireland in 2004.\n2005.\nTaylor was out for the best part of a year with a knee ligament injury and was unable to do any aerobic activity. He used the time to do some serious weight work and there is a general consensus that he is now about a stone and a half more than his official 17 stones.\nHe returned for the Scotland v Italy Six Nations fixture and lasted the pace well enough for most of the game. He looked more like his old self in the following game vs. Wales on 13 March 2005. After the tournament, he became one of only three Scots named to the Lions for their 2005 tour to New Zealand. In New Zealand he injured a hamstring and did not play a match.\n2007.\nAgreed a three-year deal with Stade Français. Despite residing in France, Taylor, with business partner Barrie Brown, managed a successful foray into the licensed trade with 99 Hanover Street, a style bar in Edinburgh's city centre.\n2008.\nWith Taylor continuing his career in France the duo's new venture, Hawke and Hunter, opened in November 2008. Taylor and Brown trade as Brown Taylor Limited and Hawke &amp; Hunter trades from the former Hallion Club on Edinburgh's Picardy Place.\n2010.\nHaving reportedly been unhappy with the number of players that play his position at Stade Français, Taylor signed a three-year deal with Bath Rugby. On 19 April 2013 Bath Rugby announced that Taylor was to be one of 7 players leaving the club at the end of the 2012/13 season. At that point, Taylor retired from Rugby and entered the hotel industry."

He was born in Darlington, South Carolina.\nByrd pitched in six games with the Athletics in 1950, spent a season back in the minors, and was called back up to the big club in 1952. That year he enjoyed his best season, going 15–15 with a 3.31 earned run average (ERA) and being selected as the American League Rookie of the Year.\nIn 1953 Byrd went 11–20, but he worked 237 innings. At the start of the 1954 season, he was part of a ten-player trade between the Athletics and Yankees. In New York he finished 9–7 with a 2.99 ERA. At the end of the season, he was sent to the Orioles as part of a 17-player mega-deal.\nByrd went 3–2 with Baltimore in 1955, before being shipped off again to the White Sox. He finished with a combined 7–8 record with a 4.61 ERA. After pitching briefly with the Sox in 1956, he ended his career in 1957 with the Tigers.\nIn a seven-year career, Byrd compiled a 46–54 record with 381 strikeouts and a 4.35 ERA in 827 innings.\nByrd lived in the small logging community of Mont Clare, just outside his birthplace of Darlington, South Carolina. He died in Darlington aged 60 after a bout with lung cancer. Darlington named a road after him (Harry Byrd Highway), which eventually became Bobo Newsom Highway, named after another major-league pitcher from the area (Hartsville)."

        "title": "Dale Davis (basketball)",
        "text": "Elliott Lydell \"Dale\" Davis (born March 25, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player who played center and power forward.\nDavis was drafted by the Indiana Pacers with the 13th pick of the 1991 NBA draft and spent the first nine years of his career with them. He quickly established himself as the team's starting power forward and was the workhorse of the Pacers' outstanding teams in the mid-1990s. He routinely averaged double-digits in points and near double-digits in rebounds throughout his Pacers career and left the franchise as the team's all-time rebounds leader in their NBA era. (The Pacers were an original member of the American Basketball Association for several years before joining the NBA.)\nFollowing the 1999–2000 season, in which Davis was named to the All-Star team and the Pacers made it to the NBA Finals, the organization decided it was time to rebuild with a younger group of players. They traded Davis to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Jermaine O'Neal and Joe Kleine, and O'Neal soon went on to become the Pacers' franchise player.\nDavis spent four years with the Blazers, putting up much the same numbers as he did with the Pacers—roughly 8 points and 8 rebounds per game. He played 313 games for the Blazers, starting 235 times.\nOn July 20, 2004, the Blazers traded Davis and Dan Dickau to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Nick Van Exel.\nOn February 24, 2005, Davis was traded again, along with guard Speedy Claxton, to the New Orleans Hornets for guard Baron Davis. Davis was released soon afterward and signed with his first team, the Pacers, on March 4, 2005. He immediately started in place of the injured Jermaine O'Neal, earning one point, seven rebounds and two blocked shots in a Pacers' road victory against the Blazers.\nIn all, Davis started all 25 games he played for the Pacers in the 2004–05 regular season, contributing 6.9 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.32 blocks per game.\nIn June 2006, he became a co-owner in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series when he bought interest in R&amp;J Racing.\nOn August 26, 2005, Davis signed as a free agent with the Detroit Pistons. He played with the Pistons for 2 years, retiring from basketball after the 2006–2007 NBA season.\nIn August 2006, Davis was shocked with a stun gun as Miami Beach police arrested him for assaulting a police officer, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest. In December 2006, Davis was acquitted of all charges.\nPersonal life.\nDavis is the biological father of Trayce Jackson-Davis who currently plays for Golden State Warriors, and played college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers of the Big Ten Conference."

The 'end names' are the Umgeni End (north) and the Old Fort Road End (south). It is the home ground of the Hollywoodbets Dolphins.\nIn October 2019, Hollywoodbets was announced as the naming rights sponsor to the ground, with it now being known as Hollywoodbets Kingsmead Stadium until August 2024.\nCricket.\nThe venue hosted the first home Test for the South African cricket team after re-admission into international cricket and also hosted the Test against the English cricket team in 1939, which lasted from the third to the thirteenth of March and was called off over fears that the English would miss their ship home.\nThe first Test match to be played here was between South Africa and England on 18 January 1923, which resulted in a draw on the 5th day\nIt has been renowned as a seamers wicket, and there is also a famous myth regarding how the tide affects batting conditions, as the ground is quite close to the beach. Many batting collapses in matches in the past have jokingly been blamed on changes in the tide.\nOn 19 September 2007 the ground witnessed Yuvraj Singh's iconic six consecutive sixes off Stuart Broad's over in the World Twenty20 match between India and England, to mark the fastest fifty ever in any form of cricket."

        "title": "Cestus (boxing)",
        "text": "A cestus or caestus (, ) is a battle glove that was sometimes used in Roman gladiatorial events. It was based on a Greek original, which employed straps called \"himantes\" and \"sphirae\", hard leather strips that enclosed and protected the fist and lower arm. Some cestuses were fitted with studs or spikes to inflict potentially lethal injuries. Cestus fighters seem to have had no form of body armour, apart from the cestus itself. Contemporary depictions show the cestus worn in pairs.\nTerminology.\nLatin \"Caestus\" or \"cestus\" translates as \"striker\". Its plural is \"caestus\". More rarely, plural \"cesti\" is used; this translates as \"thongs\". English language plural \"cestuses\" is also used.\nGreece and Rome.\nIn Greece, cestus-fights were featured in the Olympic games. Theagenes of Thasos, cestus champion in the Olympics of 480 BC, is said to have killed \"most of his opponents\"; he was also victor of the Olympic pankration and many other athletic events, and was given hero cult after his death. At some time in the development of Rome's gladiator games, cestus fighting was introduced as an arena spectacle.\nThe basic Roman cestus was made of hard leather straps, which enclosed and protected the fighter's lower arm and fist. The straps could be studded, or more extremely, spiked. \"Caestūs\" were usually worn in pairs. In Roman gladiator contests, cestus-fighters were probably matched against others of their kind; the cestus was effective protection and weaponry against other \"cestus\" fighters, and possibly against armoured gladiators equipped with other weapons. Apart from the \"cestus\" itself, the \"cestus\"-fighter would probably have had no body armour.\nLike all arena personnel (\"arenarii\"), \"cestus\" fighters were either slaves or \"infames\", \"infamous ones\" who held a very low level of citizenship, their status and privileges severely restricted because of their professional association with blood-pollution and death. Most would have had a very limited life-expectancy. As a potentially lethal, pagan blood sport, \"Cestus\" boxing is usually assumed to have been included in the banning of punitive gladiator contests under legislation of the emperor Constantine I, in 325. The reasons for these bans are disputed. Their effectiveness is questionable, as similar legislation was enacted by later Roman emperors."

        "text": "Cricket has been part of the Summer Olympics program. The only time it has been played was at the 1900 Summer Olympics with only a men's contest, won by Great Britain. It is scheduled to be included again in 2028.\nInclusion.\nCricket was originally scheduled to be included in the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics, which were held in Athens: cricket would have been the only team sport held at the Games. However, due to insufficient entries the tournament was cancelled.\nCricket was held at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris four years later but only two countries competed, Great Britain and hosts France. The French team was mostly represented by English expatriates, and it is officially considered a mixed team while the English team was represented by Devon and Somerset Wanderers Cricket Club, so it was not nationally selected. The players were also mostly club cricketers — only the British side had any first-class cricket experience, with eight such games through Somerset's Montagu Toller and Alfred Bowerman.\nThe teams played a two-day match over two innings with 12-a-side, so the match did not attract first-class status. Great Britain won the match by 158 runs to win the gold medal: if the French had held out for five more minutes, the game would have been declared a draw. Knowledge of the game would have been lost but for the forethought of John Symes, a member of the victorious team, who kept a scorecard in his own writing.\nA cricket tournament was scheduled for 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, but it was cancelled due to a lack of entries.\nReintroduction in 2028.\nMany of cricket's governing bodies, including the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), were long opposed to a return to the Olympics. The ECB withdrew their opposition in 2015, and in March 2017, it was reported that International Cricket Council chief Dave Richardson thought the \"time is right\" for Olympic cricket. It was also reported that the opposition of the BCCI had softened.\nIn October 2020, USA Cricket stated that it saw a proposed inclusion of cricket in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles as a long-term goal. In 2020, the BCCI in its Annual General Meeting decided to back the ICC's bid for inclusion of T20 cricket in 2028 after getting some clarifications from the International Olympic Committee. In August 2021, the ICC confirmed its plans to bid for the inclusion of cricket at the Olympics, starting with the 2028 and 2032 games.\nOn 9 October 2023, the 2028 Olympic organising committee announced that cricket was on the list of sports they wished to introduce. On 13 October 2023, the IOC announced that the bid was accepted and placed under voting to finalize its inclusion in 2028 during the 141st IOC Session in Mumbai between 14 and 16 October 2023. It was confirmed on 16 October 2023 that cricket would be featured in the 2028 Olympics as only two voted against inclusion, including both men's and women's T20 tournaments.\nNational representation.\nThe United Kingdom competes at the Olympics as Great Britain, and includes athletes from England, Scotland, Wales and those British Overseas Territories without their own Olympic team, while athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to represent either Great Britain or Ireland. In cricket, Scotland has its own team, Welsh players play for the England team, and the Ireland team represents all of Ireland, while Great Britain may feature players eligible for some ICC associate teams (i.e. the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey and Turks and Caicos Islands).\nThe West Indies cricket team covers much of the Caribbean, which has twelve Olympic associations: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago and United States Virgin Islands. For example, in the 50-over tournament held at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, Curtly Ambrose and Richie Richardson represented Antigua and Barbuda.\nWest Indies cricketers from Anguilla and Montserrat would be eligible for Great Britain at the Olympics, and those from Sint Maarten would be eligible for the Netherlands.\nMen's tournament.\nParticipating nations.\nNumber refer to the final placing of each team at the respective Games. &lt;br&gt;\nHost nation is shown in bold.\nWomen's tournament.\nParticipating nations.\nNumber refer to the final placing of each team at the respective Games. &lt;br&gt;\nHost nation is shown in bold."

        "text": "The Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award is presented by Major League Baseball (MLB) to the player who is judged to have \"re-emerged on the baseball field during a given season.\" The award was developed in 2005, as part of a sponsorship agreement between MLB and Viagra. In 2005 and 2006 representatives from MLB and MLB.com selected six candidates each from the American (AL) and National Leagues (NL) and one winner for each league was selected via an online poll on MLB.com. Since then, the winners have been selected by a panel of MLB beat reporters. Under the current voting structure, first place votes are worth five points, second place votes worth three, and third place votes worth one with the award going to the player with the most points overall. Past winners have often overcome injury or personal problems en route to their award-winning season.\nA Comeback Player of the Year Award has been given by \"The Sporting News\" since 1965 but its results are not officially recognized by Major League Baseball. Since the beginning of the MLB award in 2005, the recipients have been identical with the following exceptions: 2008 NL (\"TSN\" honored Fernando Tatís, MLB honored Brad Lidge), 2010 AL (\"TSN\" honored Vladimir Guerrero, MLB honored Francisco Liriano), 2012 AL (\"TSN\" honored Adam Dunn, MLB honored Fernando Rodney), 2016 (\"TSN\" honored Jose Fernandez and Mark Trumbo, MLB honored Anthony Rendon and Rick Porcello), 2018 NL (\"TSN\" honored Matt Kemp, MLB honored Jonny Venters), 2019 AL (\"TSN\" honored Hunter Pence, MLB honored Carlos Carrasco), and 2020 AL (\"TSN\" honored Carrasco, MLB honored Salvador Pérez). Liriano and Posey are the only players to win the MLB award multiple times with Liriano being the first to win it in each league.\nTwelve players were named to the Major League Baseball All-Star team in their Comeback Award-winning season: Jim Thome, Nomar Garciaparra, Dmitri Young, Cliff Lee, Brad Lidge, Aaron Hill, Tim Hudson, Lance Berkman, Jacoby Ellsbury, Buster Posey, Fernando Rodney, and Mariano Rivera, with Posey also being named to the All-MLB Team. Two players who were not named to the All-Star team in their winning year—Jason Giambi and Ken Griffey Jr.—were named to the All-Star team in their previous season. Several winners have won other awards in their winning season. Carlos Peña, Posey, Ellsbury, Griffey, and Hill won the Silver Slugger Award along with the Comeback Award. Posey won the NL MVP in his first comeback season. Lee won the Cy Young Award in his winning season and Lidge won both the Rolaids Relief Man Award and Delivery Man of the Year Award the same year. Rodney was also named Delivery Man of the Year in his comeback 2012 season. The most recent winners are Cody Bellinger of the NL and Liam Hendriks of the AL."

        "text": "The American Football League All-Star game was the annual game which featured each year's best performers in the American Football League (AFL). The game was first played in 1961 and the final AFL All-Star game occurred in 1969, prior to the league's merger with the National Football League (NFL).\nAll-League Teams.\n\"The Sporting News\" published American Football League All-League Teams for each season played by the American Football League, 1960 through 1969. From 1960 through 1966, the All-League Team was selected by the AFL players, and from 1967 through 1969 it was selected by a consensus of \"The Sporting News\" (\"TSN\"), the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), and the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA). The All-League AFL selections usually included one player at each team position on offense and on defense (i.e., one quarterback, two guards, four defensive backs, etc.). Eastern All-Stars wore red uniforms with a white top and red stars, with the colors reversed for away, while Western All-Stars wore blue uniforms with a white top and blue stars and vice versa for away. Each player wore their team's respective helmet, and unlike their regular team uniforms, all star uniforms never featured names on the back.\nAll-Star teams.\nThe AFL did not have an all-star game after its first season in 1960 but from 1961 through 1969, other AFL players were added to the All-League players to form two squads, and the league held All-Star games for those seasons. After every season except 1965, the format consisted of games between All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions. In 1965, the league champion Buffalo Bills played all-stars from the other teams.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NFL include AFL All-Star games in their statistics for the Pro Bowl. After the AFL–NFL merger of 1970, the name of the NFL's all-star game was changed to the \"AFC-NFC Pro Bowl\". Six days after Super Bowl IV, Buffalo Bills rookie running back O.J. Simpson carried the ball on the last play in AFL history in the Astrodome (in Houston, Texas) at the All-Star game on January 17, 1970.\nThe 1965 boycott.\nAfter the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star game had been scheduled for early 1965 in New Orleans' Tulane Stadium. After numerous black players were refused service by a number of New Orleans hotels and businesses, black and white players alike lobbied for a boycott. The black players all left days before the game, saying that it was clear they were not wanted. Under the leadership of Buffalo Bills players including Cookie Gilchrist and other players such as Clem Daniels, the players put up a unified front, and the game was successfully moved to Houston's Jeppesen Stadium.\nBroadcasters.\nThe following is a list of the television networks and announcers that broadcast the American Football League All-Star game during its existence."

        "text": "Ice hockey rules define the parameters of the sport of ice hockey. The sport is governed by several organizations including the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the National Hockey League (NHL), Hockey Canada, USA Hockey and others. The rules define the size of the hockey rink where a game is played, the playing and safety equipment, the game definition, including time of play and whether tie-breaking methods are used and the actual playing rules themselves. The IIHF rule book is used in both amateur and professional leagues worldwide. The NHL's rule book is the basis for the rule books of most North American professional leagues. The IIHF, amateur and NHL rules evolved separately from amateur and professional Canadian ice hockey rules of the early 1900s.\nHockey Canada rules define the majority of the amateur games played in Canada. USA Hockey defines the same for the United States (US). US high school leagues use the National Federation of State High School Associations rule book, and varsity college hockey is governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association's rules.\nHockey Canada and USA Hockey's rule books differ primarily in technical matters such as the severity of penalties handed out for various fouls. IIHF rules differ a bit more due to the differences in the dimensions of North American hockey rinks from those in the rest of the world. In recent times, both USA Hockey and Hockey Canada have been trying to make their rules more similar to the international rules. The merits of this move toward a more standardized rule book, however, are debated in amateur hockey circles.\nIn recent years, the low scores of NHL games have prompted the league to debate a wide variety of rule change proposals including enlarging the size of the goal, widening the blue and red lines to create a larger offensive zone, restricting where goaltenders can handle the puck, breaking ties with a penalty shot shootout, and eliminating the two-line pass rule."

        "text": "The 1934 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1934 season. The 31st edition of the World Series, it matched the St. Louis Cardinals against the Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals' \"Gashouse Gang\" won in seven games for their third championship in eight years.\nThe Cardinals and Tigers split the first two games in Detroit, and Detroit took two of the next three in St. Louis. But St. Louis won the next two in Detroit, including an 11–0 embarrassment in Game 7 to win the Series. The stars for the Cardinals were Joe (\"Ducky\") Medwick, who hit .379 and one of St. Louis' two home runs, Jack Rothrock, who hit a series-high 6 RBI’s, and the meteoric (\"Me 'n' Paul\") Dean brothers, Dizzy and Paul (or \"Daffy\") Dean, who won two games each with a combined 28 strikeouts and a minuscule 1.43 earned run average. The 1934 World Series was also the last in which both teams were led by player-managers, in this case the Cardinals' Frankie Frisch and the Tigers' Mickey Cochrane.\nThe two teams have met twice in the World Series since 1934; in (Tigers won in seven) and (Cardinals won in five). Tiger pitcher Denny McLain, winner of Game 6 in 1968 (coasting home on the Tigers' record-tying ten-run second inning rally on the road), had gone 31–6 during the season, upstaging \"Diz\" with his mere 30–7 that year, who at 57 went onto the Tiger Stadium field in a big cowboy hat to be photographed with McLain moments after the walk-off hit that had given the latter his thirtieth win of the season. As of 2021, they are the last two 30-game winners in the major leagues.\nThe Cardinals, led by the Dean brothers, used only six other pitchers in amassing a team earned-run average of 2.34 for their 1934 Series victory,\nPete Fox played for the losing team, yet became the only player in Series history, , to hit six doubles in a World Series.\nFor his top-of-the-sixth triple in Game 7, Joe Medwick slid hard into Tiger third baseman Marv Owen. They tangled briefly, and when Medwick went back to his position in left field for the bottom of the inning enraged Tiger fans, knowing the game was all but lost (the score was 9–0 by then), vented their frustrations on him, pelting him with fruit, vegetables, bottles and cushions among other things. It was a feat for him to make the catch of a fly ball instead of the orange thrown close to it. Commissioner Landis ordered Medwick out of the game, ending the ruckus. Newsreel footage shows Medwick slamming his glove against the dugout bench in disgust. It was the only time a Commissioner has ejected a player from any major league game, .(Audio)\nDizzy Dean nearly took himself out of the Series on a play in Game 4. In the fourth inning, he pinch-ran and broke up a double play the hard way; i.e., by taking the errant relay throw to first flush on the noggin. The great Dean lay unconscious on the field. (He was later to protest, \"Hell, it was only a glancing blow.\") He was rushed to a hospital for observation, where he was given a clean bill of health. Legend has it that at least one newspaper the next day featured the headline, \"X-ray of Dean's head shows nothing.\" Be that as it may, ol' Diz recovered rapidly enough to start Game 5 (a 3–1 loss to Tiger curveballer Tommy Bridges) the very next day.\nAccording to Charles Einstein's \"The Fireside Book of Baseball\", in the midst of the Cardinals' Game 7 rout, player-manager Frankie Frisch, the \"Fordham Flash\", called time and walked out to the mound from second base to warn Diz, \"If you don't stop clowning around, I'll take you out of the game.\" Dizzy said, \"No you won't.\" Frisch thought about this a moment, then retreated to second.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe series opener in Detroit pitted the Cardinals' 30-game winner, Dizzy Dean, against the Tigers' \"General\" Crowder. The subpar Tiger defense behind the General let him down with five errors and three unearned runs.\nIn the top of the second, the Gashouse Gang loaded the bases with a single and two errors; a single by Jack Rothrock then brought home both Ernie Orsatti and Dean to make it 2–0. In the third inning, St. Louis tacked on another run due to more shoddy Detroit fielding. Medwick singled and was forced out at second by Ripper Collins, but a throwing error by Tiger shortstop Billy Rogell allowed Collins to move to second and then score on another error by Detroit's star first baseman, Hank Greenberg. In the bottom of the third, Charlie Gehringer got the Tigers on the board with a single that drove in Jo-Jo White, but in the St. Louis fifth Medwick tattooed a home run off Crowder for a 4–1 Cardinal lead.\nThe Gang then exploded for a four-run sixth off Firpo Marberry (who had relieved Crowder) and Elon Hogsett, as Pepper Martin and Medwick each cracked RBI singles and Bill DeLancey lashed a two-run double to left. Though Detroit put up single runs in the sixth and eighth (via a Goose Goslin single that scored Greenberg and a home run by Greenberg), they could get no closer, as Dean struck out Gee Walker to give St. Louis an 8–3 win and a 1–0 lead in the series.\nGame 2.\nThe second game of the Series was much closer than the first, pitting the Cardinals' Bill Hallahan against the Tigers' Schoolboy Rowe.\nIn the top of the second, St. Louis drew first blood on DeLancey's single and Orsatti's triple. They added another run in the third as a Medwick single brought in Martin, but the Tigers came back and edged them 3–2 in 12 innings.\nGame 3.\nThe Tigers left 13 men on base as Pepper Martin's double, triple and two runs scored enabled the Cardinals to win, 4-1.\nGame 4.\nThe Tigers evened the series, winning 10-4, with five runs in the eighth. Hank Greenberg had four hits and three RBI and Billy Rogell had four RBI.\nThis game was the first time that the song, \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", was played during the World Series, after being played at a high school game earlier that year in Los Angeles.\nGame 5.\nTommy Bridges won after just one day of rest. Charlie Gehringer's home run in the sixth was the game-winning hit.\nGame 6.\nPaul Dean won his second game of the series and helped his own cause with a game-winning single in the seventh inning.\nGame 7.\nThe Cardinals easily won Game 7, 11–0, behind Dizzy Dean. Ducky Medwick was taken out of the game for his own safety after sliding hard into third baseman Marv Owen and being pelted by the crowd with bottles and fruit when he took the field in the sixth inning.\nComposite line score.\n1934 World Series (4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Detroit Tigers (A.L.)\nBrothers.\nOther brothers who appeared in the same World Series, either as teammates or opponents, before the Deans were: "

        "title": "1966 World Series",
        "text": "The 1966 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1966 season. The 63rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles and National League (NL) champion (and defending World Series champion) Los Angeles Dodgers. The Orioles swept the series in four games to capture their first championship in franchise history. It was the last World Series played before MLB introduced the Commissioner's Trophy the following year. The Dodgers suffered record low scoring, accumulating just two runs over the course of the series (both of which were in the first game), the lowest number of runs ever scored by any team in a World Series.\nThis World Series marked the end of the Dodgers' dynasty of frequent postseason appearances stretching back to 1947. Conversely, it marked the beginning of the Orioles' dynasty of frequent postseason appearances that continued until 1983.\nBackground.\nDespite the general consensus that the Orioles were short of pitching compared to the Dodgers and their star hurlers Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax, Baltimore pitching allowed only two runs in the entire series and ended up with a 0.50 team earned run average (ERA), the second-lowest in World Series history. The Orioles scored more runs in the first inning of the first game than the Dodgers would score in the whole series.\nThe Orioles got a substantial assist from long-time scout Jim Russo, who spent the first two weeks of September following the Dodgers as they won 12 of 14 games. One of the observations in his 16-page scouting report was that Dodger batters had trouble with the fastball against Gaylord Perry and Larry Dierker. Other points included Maury Wills being the lone bunt threat; left-handed pitchers forcing switch hitters to bat right-handed and Ron Fairly out of the lineup, both to the detriment of the Dodgers; and that Orioles batters should avoid swinging at Koufax's rising fastball above the strike zone. Frank Robinson also added suggestions based on his experiences in the National League when the team went over the scouting report a day prior to the start of the Series.\nBoog Powell from the Orioles and Jim Barbieri from the Dodgers were the first players to play in the Little League World Series and the World Series. Each played against each other in Game 1 of the 1954 Little League World Series. Barbieri pinch-hit for Dodger relief pitcher Joe Moeller in Game 1 of the series. Barbieri struck out in what would be the final appearance of his brief career.\nRoute to the World Series.\nOrioles.\nAfter the 1965 season that saw the Orioles finish in third place, they acquired Hall of Famer Frank Robinson from the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for starting pitcher Milt Pappas. Robinson won the Triple Crown and A.L. MVP honors in leading the Orioles to the A.L. pennant by nine games over the Minnesota Twins.\nDodgers.\nThe Dodgers were in a tight pennant race for the fourth time in five years. Going into a season ending double header in Philadelphia, the Dodgers led the San Francisco Giants by two games. The Giants were in Pittsburgh for a single game, and if they won that game and the Dodgers lost twice, the Giants would have headed to Cincinnati to play a make up game of an earlier rain-out; a win there would force a tie for first place.\nIn the first game of the double header, the Dodgers made two errors in the bottom of the eighth inning to turn a 3–2 win into a 4–3 loss. Meanwhile, in Pittsburgh, the Giants kept their slim hopes alive by getting a run in the ninth to tie, and four in the 11th to win, 7–3. The Dodgers needed to win the second game of the doubleheader. Sandy Koufax pitched the Dodgers to a 6–3 win to clinch the pennant (this appearance, which turned out to be Koufax' last in a regular season game, caused him not to be available for Game 1 of the World Series).\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn the top of the first inning, after Russ Snyder drew a one-out walk, Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson hit back-to-back home runs off of Don Drysdale to give the Orioles an early 3–0 lead. In the bottom half of the frame, Dave McNally walked Dodger leadoff man Maury Wills, who subsequently stole second. However, the Dodgers failed to score. In the second inning, Andy Etchebarren drew a leadoff walk, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by McNally, and scored on a single by Snyder to widen the lead to 4–0.\nHowever, McNally soon began to struggle with his command. In the bottom of the second inning, second baseman Jim Lefebvre hit a long home run to make it 4-1. First baseman Wes Parker then hit a fair ball down the right-field foul line, but a fan reached over the wall and picked the ball out of the dirt, turning a possible triple into a fan interference double. After McNally walked Jim Gilliam, John Roseboro hit a fly ball to right center, but Snyder saved at least a run with a lunging catch, and Baltimore escaped the inning without further damage.\nMcNally wouldn't last much longer, though, as he was taken out with one out in the bottom of the third inning after loading the bases on walks. Moe Drabowsky entered the game and struck out Parker, but then walked Gilliam, forcing in a run and making it 4-2. Drabowsky, however, got out of the jam when Roseboro popped out to Etchebarren in foul territory. This third-inning run would be the Dodgers' last run of 1966. \nFrom there, the Orioles controlled the rest of the game. They added an insurance run in the fourth inning against Joe Moeller (who replaced Drysdale in the third inning), when Davey Johnson scored from second on a fielder's choice by Luis Aparicio. Meanwhile, Drabowsky struck out six consecutive batters in the next two innings, tying Hod Eller's record from Game 5 of the scandal-tainted 1919 World Series. Drabowsky's total of 11 strikeouts in innings of relief are a record for a relief pitcher in a World Series game. The Orioles won 5–2, and the Dodgers would not get another runner across the plate in the series.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 was a matchup between two future Hall of Famers, one whose career was just beginning and the other would be making his final appearance. The Dodgers started left-handed ace Sandy Koufax, who was pitching in his last season but won his third Cy Young Award in four years with 27 wins, 317 strikeouts, 5 shutouts, and his career best 1.73 ERA. The Orioles countered with 20-year-old Jim Palmer, who won 15 games with a 3.46 ERA in his first season in the starting rotation.\nDespite the difference in experience, Palmer and Koufax traded zeroes on the scoreboard for four innings. Palmer got into trouble in the second inning when a double by Lou Johnson put runners on second and third with one out, but he got out of the jam by getting Roseboro to pop out to shortstop Aparicio, and then intentionally walking Parker to face Koufax, who popped out to second base. Surprisingly, Baltimore drew first blood against Koufax, although they were assisted by disastrous defense by Los Angeles center fielder Willie Davis.\nBoog Powell led off with a single to left. Paul Blair then hit a routine fly ball to center, but Davis lost the ball in the sun and dropped it for an error, putting two runners on with one out. Etchebarren then hit another fly to center, but Davis, again battling the sun, bobbled the ball and then dropped it for another error. Powell scored on the misplay, while Blair attempted to advance to third base; Davis subsequently released a high, rushed throw over the head of third baseman Gilliam. The throwing error - Davis' third of the inning, a World Series record that still stands - allowed Blair to score and Etchebarren to advance to third. Aparicio then cracked a stand-up double to drive in Etchebarren. Davis was charged with three errors in this inning alone, a World Series record, and all three runs were unearned.\nThe O's then earned one from Koufax in the sixth as Frank Robinson hit a triple on a fly ball that could have been caught but fell in between Davis and Ron Fairly. Powell drove him in with a single to right-center. Johnson followed with a single to right, and the runners advanced on an error by Fairly. Koufax escaped the inning after walking Blair intentionally to load the bases and getting Etchebarren to ground into a double play. Etchebarren would be the final batter that Koufax ever faced in his career.\nKoufax was replaced in the seventh by Ron Perranoski, who set the Orioles down in order. They would get two from him in the eighth, however, on a walk to Frank Robinson, a single by Brooks Robinson, a sacrifice bunt from Powell and a Johnson single off of Perranoski's glove. Perranoski threw the ball away in an attempt for an out at first, and Brooks scored on the error. \nMeanwhile, Palmer was brilliant after escaping the second inning, allowing only one runner to reach second base in the final seven frames. He completed the shutout when Roseboro popped out to Aparicio, the Orioles' shortstop; Palmer, just nine days shy of his 21st birthday, became the youngest pitcher in World Series and MLB postseason history to throw a shutout, a record that still stands. Baltimore won 6–0 to take a 2–0 Series lead.\nThe Dodgers became the third team to make six errors in one game. The Chicago White Sox, both in Game 5 of the 1906 World Series and in Game 5 of the 1917 World Series were the others, although oddly, the White Sox \"won\" both of these games.\nGame 3.\nWith the Orioles ahead in the series 2-0, the scene shifted to Baltimore's Memorial Stadium for Game 3, the first postseason game the city has hosted in the modern era of baseball. Wally Bunker of the Orioles faced Claude Osteen of the Dodgers.\nBunker, plagued with injuries in the regular season, pitched the game of his life, scattering six hits in a complete game gem. Although Osteen allowed only three hits in seven strong innings, one of those hits was a home run from Paul Blair in the fifth, which turned out to be the game's only run. The Dodgers' defense woke up after Game 2's six-error embarrassment, and they turned several excellent plays, most notably first baseman Wes Parker's spectacular jump to snare Curt Blefary's sixth inning line drive and rob him of a base hit. Nonetheless, Bunker, without a shutout in the regular season, completed the Orioles' second consecutive shutout in this World Series by retiring Lou Johnson on a grounder to Aparicio. The 1–0 win gave the Orioles a commanding 3–0 series lead, and on the cusp of their first title.\nGame 4.\nOn the brink of a sweep, Game 4 was a rematch of Game 1, pitting the young pitcher Dave McNally against the veteran Don Drysdale, both of whom had struggled in their previous match-up. However, in this outing, both pitchers excelled as Drysdale and McNally each allowed only four hits. Again, the only run scored was on a home run, this one by Frank Robinson. Willie Davis redeemed himself from his miserable Game 2 defensive blunders by robbing Boog Powell of a home run in the fourth, but to no avail as Paul Blair did the same to Jim Lefebvre in the eighth, and the Dodgers were shut out for the third consecutive time and for 33 consecutive innings, a World Series record. With the 1–0 Game 4 victory, the Orioles swept the series and won their first World Series championship in franchise history.\nThe Orioles became the first American League team other than the Yankees to win the World Series since the 1948 Cleveland Indians. The Orioles also became the last of the original eight American League teams to win a World Series at all. The Orioles had played in the Fall Classic as the St. Louis Browns in the 1944 World Series, in which they were the last original AL team, and the last of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1903 to 1960, to \"participate\" in a World Series. They were also the second-to-last \"Original 16\" MLB team to win a World Series; the 1980 Philadelphia Phillies became the last team to do so 14 years later.\nIronically, despite the historic dominance of Baltimore's starting rotation throughout the series, outfielder Frank Robinson was named World Series MVP. He became the first position player from a winning World Series team to win World Series MVP honors. (Bobby Richardson was the first position player to win the award, doing so in the 1960 World Series, but his New York Yankees lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates.)\nThe Orioles became the second team in World Series history (the 1937 New York Yankees were the first), not to commit an error in a series of any length, handling 141 total chances (108 putouts, 33 assists).\nAs of 2023, this is the only time that the Dodgers have ever been swept in a World Series.\nComposite box.\n1966 World Series (4–0): Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) over Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.)\nBroadcasting.\nNBC broadcast the series on both television and radio. In prior years, the local announcers for both the home and away teams had split calling the play-by-play for the telecast of each World Series game; however, beginning this year and continuing through , only the home-team announcer would do TV for each game, splitting play-by-play and color commentary with a neutral NBC announcer, while the visiting-team announcer would help call the radio broadcast. Thus, in 1966 NBC's Curt Gowdy (completing his first season as the network's lead baseball voice) worked the telecasts with the Dodgers' Vin Scully for the games in Los Angeles and with the Orioles' Chuck Thompson for the games in Baltimore. Bob Prince, in turn, worked the radio broadcasts with Thompson (in Los Angeles) and Scully (in Baltimore).\nAftermath.\nThis was the last hurrah for the Dodgers of this era. In an eight-year span from 1959 to 1966, they played in four World Series, winning three of them. In addition, they finished second twice (once losing in a playoff) and fourth once. Sandy Koufax, though arguably at the peak of his career, announced his retirement following the World Series because of the chronic arthritis and bursitis in his pitching elbow. In addition, shortstop and 1962 Most Valuable Player Maury Wills was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in December. Tommy Davis, the 1962 and 1963 NL batting champion, still not fully recovered from a severely broken ankle suffered in 1965, was traded to the New York Mets after the 1966 season. Finally, third baseman/utility man Jim Gilliam announced his retirement.\nThe Dodgers still had decent pitching, but their offense was among the worst in the majors. They finished in eighth place in 1967 and in seventh in 1968, before a new group of young players led the team back into contention in 1969. For the 20-year period from 1969 to 1988, the Dodgers won two World Series (1981 and 1988), five National League pennants (1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988), and seven National League Western Division titles (1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1988).\nMeanwhile, Baltimore became the dominant American League team in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Injuries slowed the team down in 1967, and they finished second to the 103-win Detroit Tigers in 1968. They won three straight A.L. pennants from 1969–71 (winning over 100 games each season), as well as the 1970 World Series. The Orioles won the American League Eastern Division again in 1973 and 1974, but they fell to the Oakland Athletics dynasty, which went to (and won) the World Series three straight years. The Orioles returned to the World Series in 1979, but they lost to the Pirates in 7 games. The Orioles won at least 90 games in all but three seasons from 1968 through 1983, culminating in their 1983 World Series victory over the Phillies. In total, the Orioles won six pennants (1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1983) in that span to go with seven American League Eastern Division titles (1969-1971, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1983) and three World Series championships.\nRecord-low scoring.\nThe 1966 series featured exceptionally low numbers of runs for all concerned, separately and jointly, and also set multiple records for other metrics related to low scoring.\nTop American League \"World Series\" pitching staffs through 1966:"

        "text": "The 1941 World Series matched the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers, with the Yankees winning in five games to capture their fifth title in six years, and their ninth overall.\nThe name \"Subway Series\" arose for a World Series played between two New York City teams. The series was punctuated by the Dodgers' Mickey Owen's dropped third strike of a sharply breaking curveball (a suspected spitball) pitched by Hugh Casey in the ninth inning of Game 4. The play led to a Yankees rally and brought them one win away from another championship.\nThe Yankees were back after a one-year hiatus, having won 13 of their last 14 Series games and 28 of their last 31.\nThis was the first Subway Series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Yankees (though the Yankees had already faced the crosstown New York Giants five times). These two teams would meet a total of seven times from 1941 to 1956 — the Dodgers' only victory coming in 1955 — with an additional four matchups after the Dodgers left for Los Angeles, most recently in 1981.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nJoe Gordon's home run in the second inning off of Curt Davis put the Yankees up 1–0. In the fourth inning, Charlie Keller walked with two outs and scored on Bill Dickey's double to extend the lead to 2–0. The Dodgers cut it to 2–1 in the fifth inning when Pee Wee Reese singled with two outs off of Red Ruffing and scored on Mickey Owen's triple. In the sixth inning, after a one-out walk and single, Gordon's RBI single made it 3–1 Yankees. After a single and error, pinch-hitter Lew Riggs' single scored Cookie Lavagetto in the seventh inning as the Dodgers pulled to within 3–2. Then they threatened in the ninth inning with hits by Joe Medwick and Pee Wee Reese, before Ruffing was able to get Herman Franks to ground into a game-ending 4-6-3 double play.\nGame 2.\nThe Yankees struck first in Game 2 on Spud Chandler's RBI single in the second with runners on second and third, but Joe Gordon was thrown out at home trying to score to end the inning. Next inning, Charlie Keller's RBI single with two on made it 2–0 Yankees. In the fifth, the Dodgers loaded the bases off of Chandler with no outs on a double and two walks when Pee Wee Reese's sacrifice fly and Mickey Owen's RBI single tied the game. Next inning, an error and single put two on with no outs off of Chandler, then Dolph Camilli's single off relief pitcher Johnny Murphy in the sixth put the Dodgers up 3–2. Wyatt gave up a pinch single to George Selkirk leading off the ninth, but nailed down a complete-game victory.\nGame 3.\nWith the veteran Freddie Fitzsimmons dueling young southpaw Marius Russo, there was no score into the top of the seventh. With two outs, Russo lined a drive off Fitzsimmons' knee that broke his kneecap. The ball caromed into Pee Wee Reese's glove for the third out, but Fitzsimmons was forced from the game. Hugh Casey, who came out to pitch in the eighth for Brooklyn, promptly gave up four straight one-out singles, the last two of which to Joe DiMaggio and Charlie Keller scoring a run each. The Dodgers made it a one-run game in the bottom half when Dixie Walker hit a leadoff double and scored on Pee Wee Reese's single, but Russo pitched a perfect ninth for a complete game as the Yankees won 2–1.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, the Yankees struck first in the top of the first on Charlie Keller's RBI single with two on off of Kirby Higbe. In the fourth, they loaded the bases with no outs on a double, walk and single and two outs later, Johnny Sturm's two-run single made it 3–0 Yankees and knock Higbe out of the game. In the bottom half, Atley Donald walked two with two outs before both runners scored on Jimmy Wasdell's double. Next inning, Pete Reiser's two-run home run put the Dodgers up 4–3, but with two out, two strikes and no runners on base in the ninth, the Yankees rallied off of Hugh Casey. First Tommy Henrich swung and missed, which would have ended the game, but Dodger catcher Mickey Owen failed to catch the ball and Henrich reached first base. Owen recollected the incident:\nJoe DiMaggio followed with a single and Charlie Keller hit a double to drive in Henrich and DiMaggio and take the lead. Bill Dickey would follow up with a walk and, along with Keller, score on a Joe Gordon double to make the final score 7–4. Johnny Murphy pitched two shutout innings to close the game as the Yankees were one win away from the championship.\nMeyer Berger of \"The New York Times\" covered the events in \"Casey in the Box\", a poem derived from the 1888 classic \"Casey at the Bat\".\nGame 5.\nIn the fifth inning, Whit Wyatt and Joe DiMaggio almost came to blows on the mound as DiMaggio returned to the dugout after flying out. Tiny Bonham pitched a complete game 4-hitter, allowing only one hit and one walk after the third inning. In the second, with runners on first and third, a wild pitch by Wyatt and RBI single by Joe Gordon made it 2–0 Yankees. Pete Reiser's sacrifice fly in the third with two on cut it to 2–1, but the Yankees got that run back in the fifth on Tommy Henrich's home run. The Dodgers hit only .182 as a team, contributing to their 5-game loss.\nComposite box.\n1941 World Series (4–1): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)\nAftermath.\nIn 1947 the Yankees and Dodgers would meet in the World Series for the second time and again play a dramatic Game 4 which was decided on a lead change with two outs in the ninth inning. That time the Dodgers would be on the winning side to tie the series but would once again end up losing it. Ironically, in the 1947 game the Dodgers’ winning pitcher was none other than Hugh Casey – the Game 4 loser in 1941 – even though he pitched to only one batter."

        "title": "1910 World Series",
        "text": "The 1910 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1910 season. The seventh edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics against the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs. The series was played from October 17 to 23, with the Athletics winning the series 4games to 1, clinching the team's first World Series.\nJack Coombs of Philadelphia won three games and Eddie Collins supplied timely hitting.\nBackground.\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nThe Athletics were making their second appearance in the World Series. They had lost the 1905 edition four games to one against the New York Giants. They had dominated the American League, leading it since early May, and eventually winning it by games. Their pitcher Jack Coombs led the American League in wins with a 31–9 record, and the Athletics had the lowest ERA in the league by some margin.\nChicago Cubs.\nThe Chicago Cubs were a dominant team in the first decade of the 1900s. They had already won two World Series, and been runners-up in another; this was their fourth appearance. The National League was initially closer than the American League, with the Cubs wrestling control of the division from the Pittsburgh Pirates in late May after a long winning streak. They never looked back, only increasing their lead over the course of the season. The Cubs' slugger Frank Schulte led the National League in home runs with 10, while pitcher King Cole had the lowest ERA in the league, 1.80. The Chicago Cubs won the division by 13 games.\nSeries preview.\nBefore the series, pundits were split over who the favorites were. The pitching of the Athletics was generally held to be superior to that of the Cubs, as the Cubs pitchers were thought to be merely decent. The Cubs, however, were felt to have a stronger catcher in Johnny Kling, and slightly stronger batters as well. Altogether, Philadelphia had a younger team, while Chicago had an older but experienced group of players. Former coach Ned Hanlon picked the Athletics, as did former pitcher Jack Dunn. However, John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants, held that the Cubs would win the series. Before the series, the Athletics played the All-Stars, featuring Ty Cobb; they played poorly on the Friday before the Series, which lowered confidence in the ability of the Philadelphia team. Second baseman Johnny Evers was out injured for the Cubs, while outfielder and strong batter Rube Oldring was injured for the Athletics.\nThis World Series featured a new ball, manufactured by the Reach Company. It had a cork center, not a rubber one. The ball was meant to be stronger and hold up better instead of becoming soft and losing its shape after being used for a long period of time.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nConnie Mack chose Chief Bender to start game 1, while Orval Overall was selected by Frank Chance. The second inning began with a double by Home Run Baker. Harry Davis sacrificed, and Danny Murphy singled to left to send Baker home. Murphy then stole second and advanced to third on Jack Barry's sacrifice. Chief Bender, the pitcher, then came up to bat, and managed to bat in a run. The next inning began with a Bris Lord double and a Eddie Collins sacrifice. Home Run Baker hit a single to shortstop which allowed Lord to score, and the score was 0–3.\nWith two outs in the eighth inning, Eddie Collins was walked. Collins was a leading base-stealer and McIntire attempted to get him out at first, but his throw to the first baseman was wild and Collins advanced to third. Home Run Baker hit a double to right field and made it 0–4. In the ninth inning, a foul by Joe Tinker was fumbled by Athletics catcher Ira Thomas, and on the next pitch, Tinker hit a double. Johnny Kling then doubled and Tinker scored. Frank Schulte was walked, and it seemed a comeback may be on, but Solly Hofman grounded out, ending the game at 1–4.\nChief Bender allowed the Cubs just three hits and one unearned run. Before the ninth inning, Bender had allowed only one hit and one base on balls. He also registered seven strikeouts, and, unusually for a pitcher, an RBI. Frank Baker had three hits and two RBI for the A's.\nGame 2.\nStar pitcher Jack Coombs was the starter for the Athletics, while Mordecai Brown began the game for the Cubs. Before the game, Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie, winners of the Chalmers Awards, were presented with new cars from Chalmers Motor Company, though Lajoie was not present and a friend accepted the car in his stead.\nJack Coombs started the game shakily, walking Jimmy Sheckard, who was forced out at second after Frank Schulte grounded and got to first base. Solly Hofman was also walked by Coombs, allowing Frank Chance to single and load the bases. Heinie Zimmerman then hit a sacrifice to score one run for the Cubs. Coombs recovered somewhat and struck Harry Steinfeldt out, ending the inning with a score of 1–0. In the bottom of the third inning, Ira Thomas advanced to first after an error, and Amos Strunk and Bris Lord had base hits, though Strunk was forced out at second base. Eddie Collins hit a double, allowing Thomas and Lord to reach home and make the score 1–2. Although Coombs continued to struggle, and twice fumbled the ball in the fifth inning, good fielding allowed Philadelphia to keep Chicago at one run. Harry Davis singled to left in the bottom of the fifth, allowing Eddie Collins to score from second base, increasing the Athletics' lead to 1–3.\nIn the seventh inning, the Cubs got one back after Jimmy Sheckard doubled and Frank Chance hit hard to center. Coombs additionally walked Solly Hofman for the third time, and the game no longer looked as though it was firmly in Philadelphia's hands. The bottom of the seventh began with Eddie Collins being walked, and Home Run Baker singled, putting Collins on third. Then Harry Davis and Danny Murphy doubled, bringing home three runs in Collins, Baker, and Davis himself. Murphy went to third after Jack Barry sacrificed, Ira Thomas sent Murphy home. Amos Strunk doubled, and Thomas scored. Bris Lord hit a fly-out, but Jimmy Sheckard dropped the ball, and Strunk came home. Lord finally ended the inning when he was caught stealing second. The six-run rally left the score at 2–9. After the inning, Lew Richie came in for the struggling Mordecai Brown.\nHeinie Zimmerman hit a double in the ninth inning, allowing Solly Hofman to score. The game ended 3–9, giving the Athletics a 2–0 lead in the series. The two teams left by train for Chicago that evening, in preparation for game three on Thursday.\nJack Coombs had pitched erratically, allowing eight hits and walking nine, but still picked up the win. The Cubs left 14 men on base, a Series record at that time. The A's combed Mordecai Brown for 13 hits. Eddie Collins was praised for his performance, which involved getting 3 hits out of four at-bats, scoring two runs and batting in another.\nGame 3.\nJack Coombs started again for Philadelphia, while Ed Reulbach was Chicago's starter. The game was played on a cold, cloudy day, and it drizzled during the second half of the match. An attendance of at least 30,000 fans had been expected by Chicago officials, but only 26,210 people showed up, though those who did stayed almost the entire game in spite of the home team's struggles.\nThe game got off to an exciting and even start. The first batter, Amos Strunk of the Athletics, was walked by starting pitcher Ed Reulbach. Bris Lord sacrificed, and Home Run Baker singled on a low curveball, putting the Athletics up 1–0. However, in Chicago's half of the inning, they matched the Athletics, as Solly Hofman sent Jimmy Sheckard home after Sheckard had advanced to third on Frank Schulte's double. Harry Davis scored for Philadelphia at the beginning of the second inning on a Jack Barry double, and Barry himself scored when pitcher Jack Coombs doubled once more. Chicago quickly matched this as well – Joe Tinker doubled, and Ginger Beaumont and Jimmy Sheckard walked, loading the bases. Frank Schulte doubled again to tie the game at 3.\nBefore the third inning, Reulbach was taken off, and Harry McIntire assumed his spot on the pitcher's mound for the Cubs. With one out and Eddie Collins on first, Home Run Baker hit a triple and put Philadelphia back in the lead. Harry Davis was hit by a pitch and went to first, and then Danny Murphy hit a three-run home run to right. This caused controversy as the Chicago players protested that the ball had not gone far enough and the hit should have counted as a double. Chicago's player-manager Frank Chance was ejected from the game, the first time in World Series history that a manager was punished in this way. McIntire was then taken off and replaced with Jack Pfiester. However, Pfiester's first pitch was hit for a double by Jack Barry, who scored when Ira Thomas hit to shortstop Joe Tinker. Tinker threw poorly to first base, allowing the Athletics to score their fifth run of the inning. A double play finally stemmed the bleeding, but the inning ended 8–3.\nAfter this, Coombs settled into the form that had gained him a reputation as one of the best pitchers in the league. His breaking balls were unhittable, and Chicago were unable to get back into the game. The next few innings therefore passed uneventfully in the batting department, until the seventh inning. The inning started with two outs, and Harry Steinfeldt had the chance to finish it, but he fumbled Home Run Baker's hit and the Philadelphia player got to first. The bases were filled by Harry Davis and Danny Murphy, and Jack Barry hit his third double of the game to earn the Athletics two runs. The bases were loaded again when Ira Thomas was walked. Jack Coombs then hit a single to score two more runs, giving the pitcher three RBI, and making the score 12–3. Chicago scored twice in the eighth inning as a result of a passed ball. The game ended 12–5.\nAfter Chicago's implosion, blame was assigned to the pitchers, who The Washington Times described as \"absolute failures\". Frank Chance even acknowledged that \"Our pitchers haven't been able to stop the Philadelphia hitters.\" On the other side of the coin, the Athletics looked unstoppable. Ty Cobb predicted that they would sweep the series, and Connie Mack confidently pronounced that they would defeat the Cubs in game 4.\nThe Athletics rapped out 16 hits to Chicago's 7. Jack Coombs gave up 5 runs but won his second game of the series.\nGame 4.\nChief Bender was chosen to start for Philadelphia, while King Cole was put out for Chicago as the last hope for the Cubs. Additionally, Jimmy Archer started as Chicago's catcher instead of Johnny Kling, as the Cubs believed that the Athletics had figured out Kling's signs. The game was planned to be held on Friday, but was postponed due to rain.\nChicago began the scoring in the bottom of the first. Jimmy Sheckard was walked and stole second, before being brought home by Solly Hofman. However, in the third inning, with two outs, Amos Strunk tripled and Chief Bender, who was on first having been walked, scored. Strunk accidentally slid past third base and was tagged out, but Bender was home before him, tying the game at 1.\nIn the fourth inning, Philadelphia had Eddie Collins on first when Home Run Baker doubled. Harry Davis struck out, but Danny Murphy doubled again and scored two runs for the Athletics. In the Cubs' half of the inning, Frank Schulte got to third after Solly Hofman's double. Frank Chance singled and Schulte went home, making it 3–2. Chicago had a good chance to re-tie the game, as there were no outs and they had men on first and second, but the Athletics took out Hofman and Heinie Zimmerman on a double play, and Harry Steinfeldt hit a fly ball, ending the fourth.\nThe next few innings passed with many close chances for the Athletics. In both the sixth and the eighth inning Home Run Baker was out at the plate. Chicago pinch hit Johnny Kling for King Cole in their half of the eighth inning, and put Mordecai Brown on the mound for the ninth.\nIn the bottom of the ninth, the Cubs were still behind 3–2, in serious danger of being swept. Frank Schulte doubled, and got to third when Hofman was tagged out bunting. Player-manager Frank Chance came up to bat with one out, and was hit by the first pitch on the finger, but the umpire ruled that he had walked into it. Then he tripled to center, tying the game. Although they now had a man on third, the next two Chicago players hit fly outs, and the game went into extra innings.\nIn the bottom of the tenth inning, with two outs, Jimmy Sheckard came up to bat. Jimmy Archer on was second, having doubled. Sheckard's single to center won the game for Chicago, 3–4.\nGame 5.\nJack Coombs started Game 5 for the Athletics, while Mordecai Brown was tasked with keeping the Cubs in contention. Further, Philadelphia manager Connie Mack opted to start Topsy Hartsel in left field, moving Bris Lord to center rather than Amos Strunk, and also switched catcher Ira Thomas with Jack Lapp. The game was played on a bright, sunny Sunday.\nTopsy Hartsel began the game with a single and stole second while Bris Lord struck out. He scored after Eddie Collins hit a single to center. Philadelphia kept this 1–0 lead until the bottom of the second, when Frank Chance doubled. He made it to third base when Heinie Zimmerman bunted, and scored a tying run on Harry Steinfeldt's hit. The Cubs had another chance to score with the bases loaded and one out in the fourth inning, but Coombs struck out two straight Cubs batters. The Athletics capitalized on this, with Jack Lapp's fifth inning single allowing Danny Murphy to score from second base.\nThe score was still 2–1 when the eighth inning began. With one out, Topsy Hartsel stole second, and was controversially called safe. Bris Lord doubled to right, giving the Athletics a run. Lord scored in turn after Eddie Collins doubled. Collins stole third and Home Run Baker singled, but the Cubs defense opted to force Collins out at the plate, allowing Baker to get to first. Harry Davis was walked – Mordecai Brown's first base on balls in Game 5 – and Danny Murphy tripled. His hit had blown past Heinie Zimmerman to center fielder Solly Hofman, scoring Baker, but Hofman's poor throw home allowed Davis to score as well. Murphy scored on a wild pitch. The Cubs scored a run in the bottom of the eighth when Frank Chance singled to send Jimmy Sheckard home. In the ninth inning, Harry Steinfeldt and Joe Tinker flew out. Jimmy Archer singled, and Johnny Kling emerged to pinch hit for the pitcher, as he did in Game 4. Kling grounded to shortstop Jack Barry, who ran to second base to force Archer out. The game ended 7–2.\nJack Coombs became the third pitcher in World Series history to win 3 games without a loss. Babe Adams did it the year before, but in seven games, and Christy Mathewson accomplished the feat in the 1905 Series. This was the Athletics' first World Series title.\nComposite line score.\n1910 World Series (4–1): Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1911 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1911 season. The eighth edition of the World Series, it matched the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics against the National League (NL) champion New York Giants. The Athletics won the best-of-seven series four games to two, in a rematch of the 1905 World Series, getting revenge over the Giants, who had won in their previous meeting.\nPhiladelphia third baseman Frank \"Home Run\" Baker earned his nickname during this Series. His home run in Game 2 off Rube Marquard was the margin of victory for the Athletics, and his blast in Game 3 off Christy Mathewson tied that game in the ninth inning, and the Athletics eventually won in the 11th. The Giants never recovered. Ironically, Mathewson (or his ghostwriter) had criticized Marquard in his newspaper column after Game 2 for giving up the gopher ball, only to fall victim himself the very next day. Baker was swinging a hot bat in general, going 9 for 24 to lead all batters in the Series with a .375 average.\nAccording to his obituary in \"The New York Times\" (July 28, 1971), Giants catcher Chief Meyers threw out 12 runners, creating a record for the most assists by a catcher during the World Series.\nThe six consecutive days of rain between Games 3 and 4 caused the longest delay between World Series games until the earthquake-interrupted 1989 World Series (which incidentally featured the same two franchises, albeit on the West Coast, and which also resulted in an A's victory over the Giants). With the sixth and final game being played on October 26, this was also the latest-ending World Series by calendar date until .\nThis was the second time in World Series history that two teams met in a World Series rematch. The first time was when the Chicago Cubs and Detroit Tigers met in consecutive years, in 1907 and 1908. This is also the first World Series to feature two teams that had previously won a title. The Athletics were the defending champions while the Giants had won it all in 1905.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nWith a perfect top of the first, Christy Mathewson set the record with 28 straight shutout innings in World Series play, a record that would be broken by Boston Red Sox's Babe Ruth with innings in the 1918 World Series. Mathewson's postseason record for consecutive scoreless innings against one team would not be broken until 2013 when the Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander shut out the Athletics (now playing in Oakland) for 30 consecutive innings in the 2012 and 2013 ALDS.\nGame 2.\nWith the score tied at 1 and with Eddie Collins on second, Frank Baker blasted a two-run home run off Rube Marquard to deep right field for the go ahead score and the Athletics held on to win game 2, 3–1.\nGame 3.\nWith the Giants up 1–0 going into the ninth with Mathewson on the mound, it appeared the series was going to be 2–1 New York. But with one out, Baker stepped up to the plate and blasted his second home run in as many games to tie it at 1. Thus, the nickname \"Home Run\" Baker was born. Two innings later with the score still tied at 1, Baker singled and scored on an error to make it 3–1. The Giants rallied for one run in the bottom half but the game ended with a runner being thrown out on a stolen base attempt.\nGame 4.\nAfter six days of rain, the series resumed. Chief Bender, after giving up two runs in the first, shut out the Giants the rest of the way on his way to a 4–2 win and 3–1 series lead.\nGame 5.\nOn the verge of elimination, the Giants fought back. They tied it at 3 with two runs in the bottom of the ninth, and then won it with a run in the tenth when Larry Doyle scored on a sacrifice fly. Home plate umpire Bill Klem later said Doyle had failed to touch home plate after sliding in. Since none of the Athletics noticed this and Philadelphia failed to appeal, Klem had to let the winning run stand. Josh Devore became the first player to get a game-tying hit in the World Series with his team one out from elimination, a feat that would not be repeated until Otis Nixon in the 1992 World Series.\nGame 6.\nBender threw a 4-hitter to clinch the series, the Athletics second consecutive World Series title. The A's pitching staff held the Giants to a .175 team batting average, lowest ever for a 6-game series.\nComposite line score.\n1911 World Series (4–2): Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1912 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1912 season. The ninth edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Boston Red Sox and the National League champion New York Giants. The Red Sox won the Series four games to three (with one tie).\nThis series, featuring close games and controversial decisions, was regarded as one of the most exciting World Series of its era. Nearly all of the games were close. Four games in this Series were decided by one run. A fifth ended in a tie. A sixth was decided by two runs. Game 7 was the only one with a margin greater than three runs. Two games, including the decisive Game 8, went to extra innings. In Games 1 and 3, the losing team had the tying and winning runs on base when the game ended. To date, this is the only World Series to end on a sacrifice fly.\nThe series showcased star pitching from Giant Christy Mathewson and Red Sox fireballer Smoky Joe Wood. Wood won two of his three starts and pitched in relief in the final game. In the deciding game, Boston rallied for two runs in the tenth inning thanks to two costly Giants fielding misplays.\nThis was one of only four World Series to go to eight games, and the only best-of-seven Series to do so. While the 1912 Series was extended to eight games due to a tie game being called on account of darkness, the , , and 1921 World Series were all best-of-nine affairs that happened to run eight games.\nIn 2020, ESPN ranked the 1912 World Series as the 8th best world series ever played.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn batting practice before Game 1, Tris Speaker drove a ball not only over the right field grandstand but completely out of the Polo Grounds. The Series opened with the Red Sox as 10–8 betting favorites. Giants manager John McGraw surprised everyone by starting rookie Jeff Tesreau rather than the great Christy Mathewson against Boston ace Smoky Joe Wood. He preferred to save Mathewson for Game 2 and the hostile crowd at Fenway Park.\nNew York struck first. Josh Devore walked with one out in the third, and advanced to third base on a single by Larry Doyle lost in the sun by Duffy Lewis. After Fred Snodgrass struck out, Red Murray's single scored Devore and Doyle for a 2–0 Giants lead. Tesreau and his spitball held the Red Sox hitless for the first five innings, but Boston then cut the lead to 2–1 in the sixth on a triple by Tris Speaker that fell to the ground untouched when neither Snodgrass nor Devore called for the ball (in an Alphonse-Gaston act), and an RBI groundout by Lewis. The Red Sox scored three runs in the very next inning, on an RBI double by Harry Hooper and a two-run single by Steve Yerkes, after Giants second baseman Doyle had muffed Wood's potential inning-ending double play grounder and had to settle for the one out at second. In the bottom of the ninth, the Giants scored a run and had the tying run on third and the winning run on second, but Wood, a spectacular 34–5 in the regular season, struck out the last two batters for the 4–3 Boston win in a complete game with 11 strikeouts. Oddly, McGraw let relief pitcher Doc Crandall bat for himself for what turned out to be the last out rather than using backup catcher Art Wilson to pinch-hit. After the game Wood said, \"I threw so hard I thought my arm would fly right off my body.\"\nGame 2.\nChristy Mathewson later said of the moment when he took the mound at Fenway Park, \"This was the only place in the world that I wanted to be. I could think of nothing greater than pitching this game for the glory of the New York Giants.\"\nAn error by Giants shortstop Art Fletcher led to three first-inning unearned Boston runs off Mathewson. Single tallies in the second and fourth by the Giants cut the lead to 3–2. Another error by Fletcher, who failed to tag Harry Hooper on a stolen base attempt, led to a fourth Boston run in the fifth when Yerkes followed the error with an RBI triple. In the top of the eighth Boston returned the favor, allowing New York to strike back for three runs. Left field at brand-new Fenway Park was unique for a incline in front of the wall (later to be called \"The Green Monster\"). Red Sox left fielder Duffy Lewis was so proficient at negotiating this incline that it was first named \"Duffy's Cliff\" in his honor, but this time Lewis tripped on the hill and failed to catch Fred Snodgrass' fly ball, putting him on first base. He scored on Murray's double, and two batters later third baseman Buck Herzog hit a two-run double to give New York a 5–4 lead.\nThe Giants' lead was brief. Lewis doubled in the bottom of the eighth, and then Fletcher's terrible day continued with his third error allowing Larry Gardner to reach base and Lewis to score. This tied the game at 5. In the ninth, Boston reliever Charley Hall, who had replaced Ray Collins in the eighth, got the first two outs but proceeded to walk Snodgrass, Larry Doyle and Beals Becker consecutively. But with the bases loaded, Red Murray grounded into a forceout and the Red Sox escaped. Boston went quietly in the bottom of the ninth, setting up extra innings. Fred Merkle led off the New York tenth with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly to give the Giants a 6–5 lead. Mathewson, who pitched the entire game for New York, came back to the mound in the bottom of the tenth with a chance to slam the door on Boston and even the Series at one game apiece, but Tris Speaker, who had hit .383 in the regular season, slammed an extra-base hit to center field. Giant third baseman Buck Herzog deliberately collided with Speaker to prevent an inside-the-park home run, but Speaker got up and came home anyway. Becker threw the ball in to cutoff man Tillie Shafer, who threw to the plate but catcher Art Wilson dropped the ball—for New York's fifth error of the game—and Speaker, who was credited with a triple on the play, scored to tie it at 6. McGraw claimed, and reporters in the press box agreed, that Speaker had missed first base, but base umpire Cy Rigler ruled that he hadn't on appeal. Lewis followed with a double to put the winning run in scoring position, but Mathewson retired Gardner and Stahl to escape the inning with a tie.\nNew York had one last chance in the top of the 11th. Snodgrass led off the inning by being hit by a pitch, but was then thrown out attempting to steal second. After Doyle struck out, Becker drew a walk but was also thrown out on an attempted steal of second, ending the inning. After the Red Sox went down in order in the bottom of the 11th, the game was called on account of darkness tied at 6, Boston retaining a 1–0 lead in the Series. The National Commission ruled that the players would still get a share of the gross receipts from only the first four games despite the Game 2 tie, a decision which caused much discontent among the players.\nGame 3.\nIn the top of the second, Red Murray doubled to center. He advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Merkle and scored on a sacrifice fly by Herzog, giving the Giants a 1–0 lead. Three innings later, Herzog doubled and scored on a single by Fletcher, stretching New York's lead to 2–0. It stayed that way until the bottom of the ninth. Rube Marquard, who pitched a complete game for the Giants, got Speaker to pop up to start the inning. Lewis followed with a grounder to first baseman Merkle, who flipped to Marquard covering first, but Marquard couldn't find the bag and Lewis reached with an infield single. Gardner followed with an RBI double, narrowing the Giant lead to 2–1. First baseman / playing manager Jake Stahl grounded to Marquard, who threw out Gardner at third base for the second out as Stahl took first. Manager Stahl then took himself out of the game for pinch-runner Olaf Henriksen. The next Boston hitter, Heinie Wagner, reached on an error by Merkle, with Henriksen, representing the tying run, advancing to third. Wagner, the potential winning run, then stole second to get into scoring position but the next batter, Hick Cady, lined out to right field to end the game. Although Josh Devore missed the ball with his glove, he managed to catch it with his bare left hand, allowing the Giants to hang on for a 2–1 victory and even the series at a game apiece.\nGame 4.\nThe Red Sox won 3–1 on Wood's complete game, eight-strikeout effort. Boston took a 1–0 lead when Gardner tripled in the second and scored on a wild pitch by Tesreau, who had lost the nail on the middle finger of his right (pitching) hand when a Harry Hooper grounder ripped it off in the first. Boston made it 2–0 on an RBI single by Cady in the fourth. In the seventh, Herzog singled and scored on Fletcher's double to cut the lead to 2–1, but in the top of the ninth, Wood helped his own cause with an RBI single. The Giants went down in order in the bottom of the ninth to give Boston a 2–1 series lead.\nGame 5.\nThe Red Sox scored two quick runs in the bottom of the third against Mathewson when Hooper led off with a triple, Yerkes also tripled, and Speaker reached on an error by Giants second baseman Doyle allowing Yerkes to score. Mathewson then proceeded to retire the next 17 Red Sox batters in a row, but that was all Boston pitcher Hugh Bedient needed. Merkle doubled and came around to score in the seventh inning to make the score 2–1, but Mathewson struck out to end the rally. Bedient retired the last seven Giant hitters in order for a three-hit complete game. Boston now led the Series 3–1, and was one victory away from a championship.\nGame 6.\nBoston pitcher Buck O'Brien, who had pitched well in Game 3 but lost to Marquard, started again in Game 6 and was shelled for five runs in the bottom of the first inning. After left fielder Devore led off the inning with a groundout, Doyle singled and Snodgrass struck out, five Giants hitters in a row hit safely, with Buck Herzog scoring on a steal of home. The inning didn't end until O'Brien picked Fletcher off first base. Marquard took over from there, throwing a complete game for his second victory of the series, and the Giants won 5–2. New York stayed alive, but Boston still led the series 3–2.\nBuck O'Brien started this game over Red Sox ace Wood at the insistence of Red Sox owner Jimmy McAleer, over the protests of Boston manager Stahl. Disgruntled Red Sox players believed their own front office was trying to extend the series and gather more box office receipts by starting a weaker pitcher. O'Brien, meanwhile, was not told he was pitching until the morning of the 14th, too late to prevent him from going out drinking and starting Game 6 with a hangover.\nGame 7.\nWood, who had pitched and won Games 1 and 4 for the Red Sox, started Game 7 with a chance to win Boston's second championship. But in a replay of Game 6, the Giants blew the game open in the first inning. Seven of the first nine Giants batters reached base, and six of them scored. Wood faced ten batters, threw them only 13 pitches and retired only one of them, with the first out coming on a sacrifice and the third when Giant starter Tesreau was caught stealing second. New York cruised from there, winning the only truly lopsided game of the series 11–4. This game featured two \"bounce\" home runs, one from Gardner of the Red Sox and another from Doyle of the Giants. This type of play, where a ball lands in fair territory and goes over the wall on a bounce, was changed by rule to a ground rule double in 1931. Game 7 also featured an extremely rare unassisted double play by an outfielder. Tris Speaker, who was known for playing very shallow in center field, caught a liner by Fletcher with one out in the top of the ninth inning and ran in, stepping on second to double off Wilson.\nThe game was delayed because of a demonstration by the Royal Rooters, the primary Red Sox fan organization of the day, because their normal seats on Duffy's Cliff had been double-sold to other fans. The Royal Rooters were lined up along the left field foul line since they had indeed paid their way in. They were not satisfied, however. Their leader, Michael \"Nuf Ced\" McGreevy, led a further demonstration after the game in front of the Red Sox offices and called for a boycott of Game 8.\nWood's awful start, the fact that he'd continued to pitch with a full windup instead of going into the stretch position with Giants on base, and the sloppy play of the Red Sox led to ugly rumors. Boston fans and respected sportswriter Tim Murnane each believed that the Boston players, angry that they didn't get a cut from the gate receipts for Game 2 and further alienated by O'Brien's Game 6 start, bet on the Giants to make their losses good. Whatever went down, the Series was tied at 3, setting up a decisive Game 8 for the championship.\nGame 8.\nThe location of this game was determined by a coin flip, which the Red Sox won. Because this game was scheduled at the last minute as a makeup of the Game 2 tie, and due as well to the game-fixing rumors and the Royal Rooters' boycott, the riveting finale of the 1912 World Series was played to a half-capacity crowd at Fenway.\nMathewson started for the Giants, and Bedient for the Red Sox. In the Giants' third inning, Devore led off with a single, advanced on groundouts by Doyle and Snodgrass, and scored on Murray's RBI double. New York held on to the 1–0 lead until the bottom of the seventh inning, when Stahl singled with one out and Heinie Wagner drew a walk. Henriksen pinch-hit for pitcher Bedient and doubled to left to tie the game at one, but Hooper flied out to center to end the rally.\nSmoky Joe Wood, who had taken a pounding the day before for Boston, replaced Bedient in relief. Wood and Mathewson, still pitching for the Giants, matched zeroes in the eighth and ninth innings, and the game went to extra innings tied 1–1. In the top of the tenth, Murray doubled with one out and scored on an RBI single from Merkle. Wood struck out Herzog and got the Giant catcher, Chief Meyers, to ground out to end the inning, but the game went to the bottom of the tenth with the Giants leading 2–1 and three outs away from a World Series victory.\nClyde Engle, pinch-hitting for Wood, led off with an easy fly ball to Fred Snodgrass in center field. Snodgrass dropped the ball, and Engle reached second base. The next day's \"New York Times\" described the play as follows: \"And now the ball settles. It is full and fair in the pouch of the padded glove of Snodgrass. But he is too eager to toss it to Murray and it dribbles to the ground.\" Hooper flied out to deep center—Snodgrass making a fine running catch right after his error—but Engle advanced to third. Yerkes was then inexplicably walked by control expert Mathewson, putting the winning run on base. Tris Speaker, who hit an even .300 in the 1912 World Series, lifted a foul pop on the first base side, but first baseman Merkle, pitcher Mathewson, and catcher Meyers allowed the ball to fall untouched in foul territory. Snodgrass later claimed that the Red Sox bench jockeys had disrupted the players' timing. Strangely, Mathewson called for catcher Meyers to take it even though Merkle was closer. Meyers couldn't reach it and it fell to the ground. Speaker then shouted, \"Well, you just called for the wrong man and it's gonna cost you the ball game!\" Given new life, he singled home Engle to tie it at 2, Yerkes advancing to third. Mathewson walked Lewis intentionally, loading the bases and setting up a force at every base, but the next hitter, Larry Gardner, flied to Devore in right field deep enough for Yerkes to tag up and score, and the Red Sox won the 1912 World Series.\nLegacy.\nFred Snodgrass’s error went down in history as \"the $30,000 muff\", a reference to the difference in the winning and losing shares, $29,514.34. After the series Snodgrass tried to explain, saying \"I didn't seem to be able to hold the ball. It just dropped out of the glove, and that was all there was to it.\"\nChristy Mathewson later wrote that \"As I look back upon the 1912 series, when we lost to the Boston Red Sox, I see it was the same. Pitchers, outfielders, the whole team collapsed under the strain.\" He had been ill-served by his team's defense. Five New York errors led to all six runs' being unearned in the Game 2 tie, an error scored the second run in Boston's 2–1 Game 5 victory and Snodgrass's $30,000 muff, along with the failure to catch Speaker's foul pop, resulted in the loss in Game 8. Mathewson started three games, completed all three and compiled a 0.94 earned-run average for the Series, but was charged with two losses and a no-decision for his efforts. The 1912 World Series was the second of three consecutive Fall Classic appearances for the Giants, all of which they lost, and Mathewson retired in 1916 with the 1905 championship the only one of his brilliant career, in which he pitched three complete-game shutouts for 27 scoreless innings, Series records that may never be equaled.\nAfter the Series was over, McAleer issued a statement apologizing to the Royal Rooters for selling their Game 7 seats out from under them. The Red Sox victory in 1912 marked the beginning of the most successful run in franchise history. Between 1912 and 1918, they played in four World Series and won all of them. But after star pitcher/outfielder Babe Ruth was sold to the Yankees following the 1919 season, Boston had to wait 28 years for its next pennant and 86 years for its next World Series victory.\nThe 1912 World Series was the first to be decided in the last inning of the final game. It was also the first Series where a team within one inning of losing came back to win. The next time a team that close to elimination recovered to win was the 1985 World Series, when the Kansas City Royals rallied in the bottom of the ninth to beat the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6, then won Game 7 and the championship. Other World Series that have ended with a Game 7 (or in this case Game 8, due to the tie) going to extra innings include the Series of , , , and . Other World Series won by the home team in its last at-bat in a Game 7 include the Series of 1924, , 1991, 1997, and .\nIt was at Game 4 of this Series that the World Series drew its 1,000,000th fan. The total attendance for this Series of 252,037 shattered the previous mark of 179,851 set the previous year, though the fact that this World Series went eight games, compared to six in 1911, was the difference. The total attendance record for this Series would stand as a record until 1921, when 269,977 attended the 1921 World Series, the first with Babe Ruth as an everyday player. Like this World Series, the 1921 World Series also went eight games, though unlike this World Series, which was a best-of-seven, the 1921 World Series was a best-of-nine.\nThe 1912 World Series was discussed at length in the 1966 book \"The Glory of Their Times\", which featured interviews with Harry Hooper, Rube Marquard, Chief Meyers, Fred Snodgrass, and Smoky Joe Wood.\nThe 1913 \"Spalding's Official Baseball Guide\" said of the 1912 World Series, \"No individual, whether player, manager, owner, critic or spectator, who went through the world's series of 1912 ever will forget it. There never was another like it. Years may elapse before there shall be a similar series and it may be that the next to come will be equally sensational, perhaps more so.\"\nComposite Line Score.\n1912 World Series (4–3–1): Boston Red Sox (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)\nSeries Statistics.\nBoston Red Sox.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nNew York Giants.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\""

The Athletics won the Series four games to one.\nThe A's pitching gave the edge to a closer-than-it-looked Series in 1913. Christy Mathewson lost his Series swan song in the final game to an old college rival and eventual fellow Baseball Hall of Fame member, Eddie Plank. With previous victories in 1910 and 1911, the Athletics became the first team to win three World Series.\nThe Giants, meanwhile, became the first National League team since the Chicago Cubs (–) to win three consecutive pennants. They were also the second club (following the Detroit Tigers –) to lose three consecutive World Series; and remain the last to do so.\nThe Series itself was a face-off between two teams that later became crosstown rivals in Oakland and San Francisco. The Oakland A's won again in a four-game sweep in the 1989 World Series, famous for the earthquake that struck before Game 3, which is the last World Series victory for the A's.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn the opener, Home Run Baker drove in three runs with three hits for the A's, including a home run. Eddie Collins went 3-for-3 and scored three runs. Despite giving up four runs and 11 hits, Chief Bender held on for a 6–4 win. The Giants struck first in the bottom of the third when Fred Merkle hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Larry Doyle's single, but in the fourth, Eddie Collins hit a leadoff triple and scored on Baker's single. After a fielder's choice and double, Wally Schang's triple scored two more runs. Baker's two-run home run after a walk in the fifth made it 5–1 Philadelphia. The Giants cut the lead to 5–4 in the bottom of the inning when after two singles and a groundout, an error Doyle's ground ball, Art Fletcher's RBI single, and George Burns's groundout scored a run each. The A's got an insurance run in the eighth off of Doc Crandall on Stuffy McInnis's RBI double.\nGame 2.\nMathewson and Plank matched craft and guile. In the bottom of the ninth inning of a scoreless game, the Giants put on a stirring baseball version of the \"goal-line stand\". With none out, the A's had Amos Strunk on third and Jack Barry on second. The next batter, Jack Lapp, grounded to first, where Hooks Wiltse, a pitcher, was filling in. Wiltse made a good stop and threw home to nab Strunk. With Barry on third now and Lapp on first, Plank grounded to Wiltse and Hooks fired home again, getting a sliding Barry. Mathewson retired the next hitter, and the game went into extra innings. In the top of the tenth the Giants broke the ice with three runs, with Mathewson singling in the winning run after a leadoff single and sacrifice bunt and then completing the extra-inning shutout by retiring the A's in their half of the tenth. After Mathewson's single, an error and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before Art Fletcher drove in two insurance runs with a single.\nGame 3.\nEddie Collins had three hits and three RBI, and Bullet Joe Bush threw a five-hitter to put the A's ahead in the series. Jeff Tesreau allowed three straight one-out singles in the first, the last of which to Home Run Baker scoring a run. After a double steal and strike out, and error on Amos Strunk's ground ball scored two more runs. The A's made it 5–0 next inning on Eddie Collins's two-run single. The Giants got on the board in the fifth when Red Murray drew a leadoff walk, stole second, moved to third on an error and scored on Larry McLean's single. The A's added to their lead in the seventh when Collins's triple and Home Run Baker's single scored a run each. The Giants scored their last run of the game in the bottom of the inning when Tillie Shafer hit a leadoff double and scored on Red Murray's single. Wally Schang's home run in the eighth off of Doc Crandall closed the scoring at 8–2 A's.\nGame 4.\nThe home team won for the first time in the series, although the visiting Giants made it close in the late innings. Wally Schang had four RBI for the A's, they now had a 3–1 series lead. Just like in Game 1, Bender struggled but went the distance for his second win of the series. The A's struck first in the bottom of the second when Stuffy McInnis hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Jack Barry's double. In the fourth, Wally Schang's single scored two and an error on Chief Bender's ground ball scored another. Next inning, after a two-out walk and double off of Rube Marquard, Wally Schang's two-run double made it 6–0 A's. The Giants were kept off the scoreboard until Fred Merkle's three-run home run in the seventh. They cut Philadelphia's lead to 6–5 next inning when George Burns's double and Tillie Shafer's triple scored a run each, but could not score again.\nGame 5.\nPlank led the Athletics to victory, allowing the Giants only two hits, but his own error in the fifth inning cost him a shutout. The A's scored a run in the first on Home Run Baker's sacrifice fly with runners on first and third, then scored two more in the third on Baker's single and Stuffy McInnis's sacrifice fly. The Giants avoided a shutout in the fifth on Larry McLean's RBI single.\nThis was the A's third series title in four years. They had also won in 1910 and 1911.\nComposite box.\n1913 World Series (4–1): Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1968 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1968 season. The 65th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Detroit Tigers and the National League (NL) champion (and defending World Series champion) St. Louis Cardinals. The Tigers won in seven games for their first championship since 1945, and the third in their history.\nThe Tigers came back from a three-games-to-one deficit to win three consecutive games, largely on the arm of Mickey Lolich, who was named World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP); , he remains the last pitcher to earn three complete-game victories in a single World Series. In his third appearance in the Series, Lolich had to pitch after only two days' rest in the deciding Game 7, because regular-season 31-game winner Denny McLain was moved up to Game 6 – also on two days' rest. In Game 5, the Tigers' hopes for the title would have been in jeopardy had Bill Freehan not tagged out Lou Brock in a home plate collision, on a perfect throw from left fielder Willie Horton, when Brock elected not to slide and went in standing up.\nThe 1968 season was tagged \"The Year of the Pitcher\", and the Series featured dominant performances from Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson, MVP of the 1964 and 1967 World Series. Gibson came into the World Series with a regular-season earned run average (ERA) of just 1.12, a modern era record, and he pitched complete games in Games 1, 4, and 7. He was the winning pitcher in Games 1 and 4. In Game 1, he threw a shutout, striking out a Series record 17 batters, besting Sandy Koufax's 1963 record by two; it still stands as the World Series record today. In Game 4, a solo home run by Jim Northrup was the only offense the Tigers were able to muster, as Gibson struck out ten batters. In Game 7, Gibson was defeated by series MVP Lolich, allowing three runs on four straight hits in the seventh inning, although the key play was a Northrup triple that was seemingly misplayed by center fielder Curt Flood and could have been the third out with no runs scoring.\nThe World Series saw the Cardinals lose a Game 7 for the first time in their history. This was the sixth World Series of the 1960s to go to a full seven games, the most of any decade. The Tigers were the third team to come back from a three-games-to-one deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series, the first two being the 1925 Pirates and the 1958 Yankees; since then, the 1979 Pirates, the 1985 Royals, and the 2016 Cubs have also accomplished this feat.\nDetroit manager Mayo Smith received some notoriety for moving outfielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop for the 1968 World Series, which has been called one of the gutsiest coaching moves in sports history by multiple sources. Stanley, who replaced the superior fielding but much weaker hitting Ray Oyler, would make two errors in the Series, neither of which led to a run.\nThis was also the final World Series played prior to MLB's 1969 expansion, which coincided with the introduction of divisional play and the League Championship Series. Thus, it was the final World Series that guaranteed the teams with the best records from each league would be playing.\nAll seven games of NBC's TV coverage were preserved on black-and-white kinescopes by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and circulate among collectors. Games 1 and 5 have been commercially released; these broadcasts, and that of Game 7, were frequently shown on CSN (Classic Sports Network) and ESPN Classic in the 1990s and 2000s.\nTigers pitcher Mickey Lolich was named World Series MVP. Lolich compiled a 3-0 record (all three of his starts were complete games), with a 1.67 ERA and 21 strikeouts.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Tigers roared into Game 1 by setting a then-team record with 103 victories on the season and were appearing in their first World Series in 23 years. The Tigers led the American League with 185 home runs. Their team batting average was .235, fourth best in the league; the team stole only 26 bases on the year. The Cardinals, on the other hand, stole 110 bases, led the NL with 48 triples, and had a team batting average of .249, but hit only 73 home runs. Pitching was about even as both teams set their rotations for Game 1 with solid starters and adequate relievers.\nFans overflowed Busch Stadium for Game 1 to watch the highly anticipated match-up of the Major League's top two pitchers—the Cardinals' Bob Gibson (22–9, 1.12 ERA) and the Tigers' Denny McLain (31–6, 1.96 ERA). Gibson was looking to become the first National League pitcher to win six World Series games while McLain was pitching in his first World Series game. The Cardinals had far more World Series experience than the Tigers with most of the Cardinal lineup (including all nine Game 1 starters) having played in a prior World Series. Both pitchers were highly competitive, fast workers, sporting overpowering fastballs coupled with excellent control.\nGibson's performance in Game 1 was phenomenal. The menacing right-handed pitcher shut out the Tigers on just five hits, and he struck out a World Series-record 17 Detroit Tigers batters.\nThe Cardinals broke through with three in the fourth off McLain. After McLain walked Roger Maris and Tim McCarver, Cardinal third baseman Mike Shannon singled in Maris and went to second base when Tiger left fielder Willie Horton misplayed the ball. McCarver pulled in at third. Cardinal second baseman Julián Javier followed this by singling in both baserunners to make the score 3–0. Outfielder Lou Brock added a home run in the seventh inning to complete the scoring.\nGibson finished the game in the ninth inning with his 15th, 16th, and 17th strikeouts to pass Sandy Koufax's previous record of 15, set in the 1963 World Series.\nGame 2.\nThe Tigers' starting pitcher Mickey Lolich earned a complete-game victory and the Tigers tied the Series.\nTiger outfielder Willie Horton hit a home run in the second inning; Lolich also helped his own cause with a homer in the third inning off the Cardinals' starter, Nelson Briles, scoring the eventual game-winning run. This was the only home run that Lolich hit during his entire professional career. The Tigers broke the game open in the sixth inning when first baseman Norm Cash led off with another homer, and second baseman Dick McAuliffe later provided a two-run single.\nCardinal first baseman Orlando Cepeda gave St. Louis a run with an RBI single in the sixth, but that was all they scored. Al Kaline scored in the seventh inning when Jim Northrup hit into a double play, and the Tigers scored their final two runs in the ninth inning with bases-loaded walks to Don Wert and Lolich.\nGame 3.\nIn the first of three games at Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Al Kaline started the scoring with a two-run homer in the third inning, but the Cardinals came back in the fifth inning on an RBI double by center fielder Curt Flood off starter Earl Wilson. After Wilson put another batter on base, catcher Tim McCarver launched a three-run home run for the eventual game-winning runs off relief pitcher Pat Dobson. The Tigers cut the deficit to just one run on a home run by Dick McAuliffe. But Orlando Cepeda put the game out of reach in the seventh inning by smacking a three-run home run.\nThe Cardinals' reliever Joe Hoerner entered the game in the sixth in relief of Ray Washburn (who got the win) and earned a save. Hoerner also collected a single batting in the eighth and became the first major leaguer to get a hit in the World Series after going hitless for the entire season.\nGame 4.\nTiger manager Mayo Smith, needing another left-handed bat in the lineup, made a major change by inserting veteran Eddie Mathews at third base. Mathews, recovering from a spinal operation that nearly ended his career, had one hit in the last game of his major league career. After a 35-minute rain delay, hard-hitting Hall-of-Famer Hank Greenberg threw out the first pitch.\nMcLain had trouble warming up amidst the rainfall, and was throwing with less velocity from the outset. A 31-game winner during the regular season, he struggled for the second time in this World Series, as this one-sided pitching match-up with Bob Gibson showed. Lou Brock led the game off with a home run, and Mike Shannon added an RBI single later in the first inning. Two more Cardinals runs were knocked in during the third inning on Tim McCarver's triple and Mike Shannon's double. McLain's troubles continued, and after a walk to Julián Javier, the umpires stopped the game due to rain with two out in the third inning. McLain did not return when play resumed after a one-hour and 15-minute rain delay. Bob Gibson did return after the delay, and helped his own cause by hitting a home run off Joe Sparma in the fourth inning. Next, Lou Brock knocked a triple and scored on a ground-out by Roger Maris.\nThe Cardinals' final runs came in the eighth inning when Gibson walked with the bases loaded, forcing in one run, and then Lou Brock drove in three more runs with a double. Brock was just a single short of hitting for the cycle in this game.\nThe Tigers' only run came in the fourth inning when Jim Northrup hit a home run. Other than that, Gibson was a nearly perfect pitcher, tossing his second complete game in this World Series while striking out ten batters. The Cards now had a commanding 3–1 series lead.\nGame 5.\nWith the World Series on the line, the Tigers used their winner of Game 2, Mickey Lolich, as their starting pitcher. Lolich's first inning in this game was not too promising, as he allowed an RBI single by Curt Flood and a two-run home run to Orlando Cepeda. However, Lolich soon settled down, striking out eight Cardinal batters and allowing no more runs.\nTigers' first baseman Norm Cash began the team comeback with a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning, plating Mickey Stanley who had tripled. This was followed by a Willie Horton triple and Jim Northrup's RBI single, making it a 3–2 game. In the fifth inning, the Cardinals had a chance to go up by two runs after Lou Brock hit a one-out double. Cardinal second baseman Julián Javier followed with a base hit to left. Outfielder Willie Horton fielded the ball off the ground and then fired the ball towards home plate. Instead of sliding into home plate, Brock tried to bowl over Tiger catcher Bill Freehan. However, Freehan caught and held onto the ball while blocking the corner of the plate with his foot, and Brock was called out. This was the last time that the Cardinals threatened to score in the game.\nThe Cardinals' starting pitcher Nelson Briles was taken out of the game in the seventh inning with one runner on base, and was replaced by reliever Joe Hoerner. After Hoerner loaded the bases, the Tigers began a game-winning rally, with Al Kaline hitting a two-run single to give his team a 4–3 lead. Norm Cash then knocked in an insurance run with a single.\nJose Feliciano's unconventional pre-game singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" aroused considerable controversy, with the Tigers and NBC receiving thousands of angry letters and telephone calls about the performance. Lolich also blamed Feliciano's unusually long rendition for causing him to get cold after his warm-ups and thus give up three early runs.\nGame 6.\nNow needing two wins in St. Louis to win the World Series, Tiger manager Mayo Smith chose Denny McLain again as his starting pitcher, even though he had only two days' rest and had not been very successful in his two prior Series starts. Cardinals' manager Red Schoendienst stayed with his normal three-starter rotation, selecting Ray Washburn, who had won Game 3. The choice of McLain paid off for the Tigers, as he pitched a complete game in a 13–1 rout of the Cardinals.\nThe Tigers went up 2–0 in the second inning on RBI hits by Willie Horton and Bill Freehan. In the third, the Tigers sent 15 batters to the plate and scored 10 runs off of three Cardinals pitchers. Jim Northrup's grand slam highlighted the inning. Al Kaline added a home run in the fifth inning. The Cardinals' lone run came off an RBI single by Julián Javier with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, but that was all they could do against McLain.\nGame 7.\nIn a fitting end to this Series (and the final game of Roger Maris' career) the two teams' hottest pitchers, Mickey Lolich and Bob Gibson, squared off in a classic duel, until an infamous hit over the head of Curt Flood. Like McLain in Game 6, Lolich was starting on only two days' rest.\nLolich and Gibson matched zeroes for six innings, but in the top of the seventh, Gibson surrendered two-out singles to Norm Cash and Willie Horton. Jim Northrup then hit a hard smash to deep center; Curt Flood, who won numerous Gold Glove awards in his career, misjudged it and briefly started in on the ball before turning around to go back. The ball one-hopped the warning track, two runs scored, Northrup wound up with a triple, and Lolich had all the runs he needed. Flood has been criticized by some who believe he would have caught the ball had his first steps been back instead of in. Jim Northrup said, \"[Flood] slipped a little, but the ball was 40 feet over his head. He never had a chance to catch it.\" However, his teammate Denny McLain claimed in his 1975 book that \"Flood blew it.\" Orlando Cepeda, in his 1998 autobiography \"Baby Bull\", asserts that Flood would have caught the ball, had he not misjudged it. In the October 29, 1968, issue of \"The Sporting News\", both Flood and manager Red Schoendienst indicated they would have expected the normally sure-handed outfielder to catch such a ball. By starting in, Flood had to both reverse direction and then regain his acceleration. He then slipped on the wet grass before recovering his speed, and by that time the ball was well beyond him. Bill Freehan then doubled in Northrup, and in the top of the ninth, Don Wert added an RBI single.\nThe Cardinals got a run in the ninth on a Mike Shannon homer, but that was all as Lolich pitched his third complete game. The final out of the series was recorded when Bill Freehan caught a pop foul off the very next batter, Tim McCarver. Gibson struck out eight in the losing cause, giving him a record 35 strikeouts by one pitcher in a World Series, but Lolich was named World Series MVP. This is the last World Series game to date to feature complete games from both starting pitchers.\nCardinals shortstop Dal Maxvill went hitless in 22 World Series at-bats, a record.\nComposite box.\n1968 World Series (4–3): Detroit Tigers (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1965 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1965 season. The 62nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers against the American League champion Minnesota Twins. The Dodgers won in seven games. It is best remembered for the heroics of Sandy Koufax, who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. Koufax did not pitch in Game 1, as it fell on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, but he pitched in Game 2 and then tossed shutouts in Games 5 and 7 (with only two days of rest in between) to win the championship.\nThe Twins had won their first pennant in Minnesota and the franchise’s first since 1933 when the team was known as the Washington Senators. The Dodgers won their second title in three years, and their third since moving to Los Angeles in 1958.\nBackground.\nBoth teams improved from sixth-place finishes in 1964; the Twins won the A.L. pennant with relative ease while the Dodgers were locked in a season-long five-way battle in the N.L. among themselves, the Giants, Pirates, Reds, and Braves. After the Giants won their 14th-consecutive game to take a -game lead on September 16, the Dodgers went on a 13-game winning streak over the final two weeks of the season to clinch the pennant on the next to last day of the season over the second place rival Giants.\nDuring the 1965 season, the Dodgers relied heavily on the arms of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, and would rely on them even more in the World Series, as the Dodgers only used seven pitchers. The Dodgers' strong core of pitchers, which also included Claude Osteen and Ron Perranoski, kept them in the pennant race and into the Series. Koufax, surviving on a steady diet of Cortisone and pain killers for his arthritic left elbow, pitched five times in 15 days down the stretch, winning four (three shutouts), including 13 strikeouts in the pennant winner against Milwaukee.\nDodger hitting however remained strictly popgun, especially after Tommy Davis went down in late April for the season with a broken ankle. Manager Walter Alston promptly called up 12-year minor league veteran Lou Johnson from Spokane. Johnson led the Dodgers, along with ROY Jim Lefebvre, in home runs with just 12.\nThe Twins, managed by Sam Mele, had a more balanced attack, equally strong in pitching and hitting, although their defense committed 173 errors including 39 by shortstop Zoilo Versalles. Offensively Mele again had balance with good hitting, power and speed up and down his lineup that included the AL's leading hitter (Tony Oliva, at .321), and 20-plus home runs from five different players, including top-level slugger Harmon Killebrew, normally good for 40+ per year, though limited to 25 in 1965 due to missing nearly two months of the season with an injury. Pitching was spearheaded by 21-game winner Mudcat Grant, Jim Kaat, and Camilo Pascual.\nThis was only the second World Series where both teams were located west of the Mississippi River. The first occurred in 1944, when the St. Louis Browns faced their Sportsman's Park tenants, the St. Louis Cardinals.\nThis was the first of 11 consecutive World Series that did not have the New York Yankees playing in it.\nIt was also the first series in which both teams had had losing records the previous year. This has since been repeated two other times, both times also involving the Twins—in their championship seasons of and .\nThis World Series was the first in which all games were played in cities that did not have National League or American League teams in 1903, the year of the first modern World Series.\nAlso, it is the earliest World Series whose telecasts are known to survive in their entirety; the CBC has complete kinescopes of all seven games in its archives. \nSummary.\nThe Twins won the first two games of the series against Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax, but once Claude Osteen shut out the Twins in Game 3, things turned around. Willie Davis of The Dodgers tied a World Series record stealing 3 bases in one Game, game 5; the record was set by Honus Wagner in 1909. The Dodgers proceeded to win the three middle games at Dodger Stadium and Koufax would pitch two shutouts including a three-hitter with ten strikeouts to clinch. Ron Fairly hit two home runs for the Dodgers, both in losing efforts.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nGame 1 was set to be a pitching duel between Dodgers' Don Drysdale and the Twins' Mudcat Grant (21–7, 3.30 ERA on the year). Drysdale was starting because the game fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in the Jewish calendar. Dodger ace Sandy Koufax, who is Jewish, stated he would not pitch that day.\nIn the Twins' third inning any thought of a pitchers' duel was put to rest. Going into that inning, it was 1–1. Coming out, it was 7–1. It started with a Frank Quilici double to left field, followed by an error by Jim Lefebvre, allowing the pitcher Grant to reach. Then, shortstop Zoilo Versalles stepped to the plate. He had hit 19 home runs in the regular season and would later win the AL MVP Award for that year. He crushed a pitch from Drysdale for a three-run home run to make the score, 4–1. However, the Twins' scoring wasn't over. With still no one out, left fielder Sandy Valdespino began things again with a double. After a few outs and baserunners, and a single by Harmon Killebrew, the Twins had two runners again. With three straight singles (Earl Battey, Don Mincher, and Quilici), scoring three unearned runs, the Twins had jumped out to a six-run lead and would never look back, winning the game 8–2.\nFrank Quilici set a World Series record with his two hits in the third inning. Mudcat Grant was the first black World Series game-winner for an American League team.\nThe Dodgers had scored their runs on a Ron Fairly homer and a Maury Wills bunt single that scored Lefebvre. Grant received the win while Drysdale took the loss. In the postgame news conference, a reporter jokingly said to Dodger manager Walter Alston, \"I bet you wish Drysdale was Jewish too.\"\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, the Twins this time got to Dodger ace Sandy Koufax. Minnesota's pitcher, this time Jim Kaat, again shut down the Dodgers' weak offense. A heavy rain storm soaked Metropolitan Stadium overnight, and the two teams slogged their way through the first five innings. In the top of the fifth, Ron Fairly singled, then left-fielder Bob Allison made a diving, sliding catch of a fly ball off the bat of Jim Lefebvre, preventing a run. Aided by an error, the Twins broke the scoreless tie in the sixth, Versalles hit a missile shot and when Jim Gilliam bobbled the ball at third base, the ball ricocheted off Gilliam and into left field. Versalles reached on the two-base error, then scored on a Tony Oliva double. Killebrew followed with a single, plating Oliva. That is all the runs the Twins would need, though Kaat added insurance in the eighth with a two-run base hit of his own. The Twins went up 2–0 in the Series.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, pressure was on Claude Osteen to have a good start so Los Angeles would not go down 0–3. He faced Camilo Pascual, who had a quality (though somewhat injury plagued) year (9–3, 3.35 ERA). Dodger Stadium was filled to capacity and fans were treated to an appearance from Casey Stengel, a member of the 1916 Dodgers World Series team. Stengel, sans his cane despite a broken hip, hobbled on to the field and threw out the first pitch.\nIn the first inning, Versalles led off with a double. But with two men on, Versalles was caught stealing home on the front end of an attempted double steal. In the fourth, John Roseboro put the Dodgers on the board with a two-run single. The play cost the Dodgers dearly, Jim Lefebvre bruising his heel crossing the plate with the second of the two runs. The Dodgers, already short on hitting (Lefebvre was batting .400 at the time), went with Dick Tracewski (.118 for the Series) at second base the rest of the way. The Twins received a scare of their own in the seventh inning. Catcher Earl Battey, chasing a popup, collided full speed with the railing used to cover sub-field level \"dugout seats\" next to the Twins dugout. Battey crumpled in a heap holding his neck and was replaced by Jerry Zimmerman. Los Angeles continued to score runs on a Willie Davis single and a Lou Johnson double in the fifth, then a Wills double in the sixth.\nOsteen, who as a pitcher for the Senators had had a perfect 5–0 record against the Twins, completed the game by getting Zimmerman to ground into a double play. He allowed only five hits, succeeding where the Dodger aces hadn't in Games 1 and 2.\nGame 4.\nIn a rematch of Game 1 pitchers Drysdale and Grant, the Dodgers ace prevailed, allowing only two runs on five hits. He had eleven strikeouts, fanning Jimmie Hall and Don Mincher three times each. Grant gave up three runs in the first five innings, then was removed in the sixth, when the Dodgers got three more.\nThe Twins opened the game with aggression when Sandy Valdespino tried to stretch a single into a double. Lou Johnson, not known as a great fielder, gunned down Valdespino at second. The Dodgers scored twice without getting the ball out of the infield. Maury Wills collided at first base with Twins second baseman Frank Quilici on an infield single as pitcher Grant was slow to cover the bag. The play cartwheeled Wills backwards, but the Dodger dusted himself off and promptly stole second. Wills went to third on another infield single, this time by the speedy Willie Davis, as Grant was again slow to cover. Wills scored when Ron Fairly beat out a potential double-play grounder.\nIn the bottom of the second, Dodger speed made up for what seemed a lack of power. Parker bunted a single, then stole second and took third when Grant's throw went wild. Parker scored when Roseboro's grounder to second got through Quilici.\nThe Dodgers then showed power with Parker and Johnson home runs. The Twins had scored their two runs on home runs from Killebrew and Oliva. Back in form, Drysdale evened the series as L.A. won, 7–2.\nGame 5.\nIn Game 5, the Minnesota pitcher who had done so well in Game 2, Jim Kaat, did not do as well this time, as the Dodgers won their third straight. Koufax gave up only four hits and one walk, striking out ten. Kaat gave up two runs quickly in the first inning, then again in the third. Dave Boswell came in to attempt to stop the bleeding and Jim Perry did the same. Koufax basically put the game out of reach in the seventh, when he helped himself out with an RBI single to score Fairly. The Dodger's win put them up 3–2 in the series.\nIn the first inning, Dodger speed forced the Twins into fielding mishaps. Wills doubled and Gilliam singled in the run. Willie Davis bunted and third-baseman Killebrew's hurried throw to first went high, enabling the streaking Davis to make it all the way to third and plating Gilliam. The Dodgers collected 14 hits and four stolen bases, while Koufax steadily kept the Twins in check for the shutout.\nGame 6.\nIn Game 6, Osteen did not fare as well as he had in his last start. In the fourth inning, Battey reached on an error by Dick Tracewski, followed by a Bob Allison two-run home run. Grant, for the Twins, was on his game once again. He also helped himself, as had Koufax for L.A. the game before, but in this case with a towering three-run home run, after Quilici was intentionally walked to get to Grant. A Fairly home run, his second of the series, put the Dodgers on the board to make the score 5–1, but that's all they would get as Grant pitched a complete game.\nTwins manager Sam Mele chose to leave veteran pitchers Pascual and Perry and youngster Jim Merritt in the bullpen, instead going with Grant on two days' rest. Twins catcher Earl Battey brought the nearly 50,000 Metropolitan Stadium fans to their feet by leading off the second inning with a triple past a diving Willie Davis in center. Battey showed no outward ill-effects of his collision with the railing in Game 3, diving headfirst into third base on the play. Osteen promptly struck out Allison and Quilici, however, to quell the threat. Battey continued his fine play in the fourth by hustling to first when Tracewski booted his groundball, and Allison followed with a home run. Grant pitched solidly and the Twins tied the series at 3–3.\nIn this game, Mudcat Grant became just the seventh pitcher to homer in a World Series game.\nGame 7.\nDodger manager Walt Alston was torn between starting Drysdale on normal rest or Koufax with only two days' rest. He decided on the left-handed Koufax, figuring if needed he would use the right-handed Drysdale in relief, then go back to his left-handed relief ace Ron Perranoski. Koufax told announcer Vin Scully in a post-game interview that he and Drysdale had come to the ballpark not knowing which one would be on the mound (though other sources indicated that Alston had informed Koufax the day before but asked him to keep it a secret). According to Koufax, the manager announced the decision purely in strategic terms regarding lefty vs. righty, saying he worded his announcement without even using the pitchers' names, saying only that he thought he'd \"like to start the left-hander.\" The Twins went with Kaat, also starting on two days' rest. Both managers had relief pitchers warming up as their starters began the game.\nKoufax had trouble throwing his curveball for strikes but escaped a couple of early jams, including two walks in the first inning and an unusual incident in the third inning when Zoilo Versalles stole second base with one out, but was called back after batter Joe Nossek was ruled out for interference. Koufax effectively gave up on his curveball and pitched the late innings almost exclusively with fastballs, still baffling the hard-hitting Twins. In the fourth inning, Dodger left fielder Lou Johnson told Koufax that he would get him the only run he would need. Johnson promptly hit one off the left-field foul pole to give the Dodgers a 1–0 lead. Ron Fairly followed with a double and scored on a Wes Parker single. The two runs came on three consecutive pitches.\nKnowing Kaat was on short rest, manager Mele pulled him quickly. Al Worthington, Johnny Klippstein, Jim Merritt, and Jim Perry combined to shut out the Dodgers for the rest of the game. The Twins threatened again in the fifth inning when they had runners on first and second with only one out. Versalles hit a hard grounder down the third base line that appeared to be going for a double. This could have ended Koufax's day as Drysdale was warming up in the bullpen. But third baseman Jim Gilliam (who was often replaced late in games for defensive reasons) made a diving, backhanded stop and stepped on third for a force. Koufax bore down and got the third out. He ended up tossing a three-hit shutout, striking out ten in one of the greatest Game 7 pitching performances ever.\n\"Sweet Lou\" Johnson hit two home runs, including the game-winner in the clinching Game 7.\nNo relief pitchers were used by the winning team in any game of this series; the winning starting pitcher went the distance in all seven games. This had not happened since 1940, and has never been repeated since.\nThe Twins' loss in Game 7 remains the only World Series game the Twins have lost at home, having later won all their home games in 1987 and 1991. Through 2022, the Twins have never won a road World Series Game (not including when the franchise was the original Washington Senators).\nThe National League won its third consecutive World Series (Dodgers in 1963, St. Louis Cardinals in 1964). The Senior Circuit would not claim back-to-back titles again until 1975 and 1976, when the Cincinnati Reds did so.\nAlthough the Dodgers had played the maximum seven games in four best-of-seven World Series when they were located in Brooklyn (in 1947, 1952, 1955, and 1956), 1965 marked the first time they had done so when located in Los Angeles. It did not happen again until 2017. The Brooklyn Dodgers had also played seven games in the 1920 World Series when it was a best-of-nine series, losing to Cleveland five games to two.\nThis was the third World Series involving the Dodgers where the home team won the first six games before the visiting team won the seventh. It occurred in 1955 and 1956 vs. the Yankees, with the Dodgers winning the former at Yankee Stadium and losing the latter at Ebbets Field. The pattern repeated in 1971, when the Pittsburgh Pirates prevailed over the Baltimore Orioles.\nComposite box.\n1965 World Series (4–3): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Minnesota Twins (A.L.)\nAftermath.\nThe Dodgers would return to the World Series the following year, only to be swept in four straight games by the Baltimore Orioles. The Dodgers scored twice in Game 1, but those would be only runs they would score in the \"entire series\". Despite being at the peak of his career, Sandy Koufax retired after the series at age 30, due to chronic arthritis and bursitis in his pitching elbow.\nMeanwhile, the Twins would have to wait 22 more years before returning to the World Series in 1987, where they would finally win their first championship since 1924 (known then as the Washington Senators), and their first since moving to Minnesota, by beating the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. That series was the first series in which the home team won all games, a feat Sandy Koufax prevented in Game 7 of this series. Since the 1987 Series, that feat has been successfully accomplished twice more in 1991 (also involving the Twins, this time defeating the Atlanta Braves) and 2001 (In which the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees).\nThis would be the final World Series where both teams' uniforms only featured numbers. All World Series since 1966 have featured at least one team with names on the uniform.\nUmpire Eddie Hurley, who worked home plate in games 1 and 7, was forced to retire following the Series by American League president Joe Cronin due to having surpassed the new mandatory retirement age of 55. Hurley was the home plate umpire when St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck sent 3-foot-7 midget Eddie Gaedel to bat in a 1951 game vs. the Detroit Tigers.\nThree umpires in this series—American League's Red Flaherty, Bob Stewart and National League's Tony Venzon—all worked the 1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and the 1970 World Series; while the other two National League umpires Ed Sudol and Ed Vargo were both on the crew for the 1969 National League Championship Series, the 1971 World Series, the 1973 National League Championship Series, and the 1974 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\nThis would also be the final World Series where Ford Frick was the commissioner of baseball."

        "text": "The 1938 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1938 season. The 35th edition of the World Series, it matched the two-time defending champion New York Yankees against the Chicago Cubs. The Yankees swept the Series in four games for their seventh championship overall and record third straight (they would win four in a row from to , and five in a row later from to ).\nDizzy Dean, who had helped carry the Cubs to the National League pennant despite a sore arm, ran out of gas in the Series as the Yanks crushed the Cubs again, as they had in . Yankee starting pitcher Red Ruffing won two games, although he allowed 17 hits in 18 innings pitched. After Game 2 of the Series, the Bronx Bombers would not return to Wrigley Field for nearly 65 years until a three-game interleague series with the Cubs beginning June 6, 2003.\nThis was the first World Series played at Wrigley Field following the bleacher reconstruction of 1937, which had significantly shortened the left-center field power alley.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nGame 1 of the Series matched the Yankees' Red Ruffing, who had won 21 games during the season, against the Cubs' 22-game winner Bill Lee. In the top of the second inning, Lou Gehrig walked and moved to third on a single by Bill Dickey. George Selkirk then reached on an error by Cub second baseman Billy Herman scoring Gehrig, and Joe Gordon drove Dickey in with a single for a 2–0 Bomber lead.\nIn the bottom of the third, the Cubs cut the lead in half when Ripper Collins singled to lead off and moved to second on a groundout by Lee. Stan Hack's single to right scored Collins, Hack taking second on the throw home. But when he attempted to score on an infield single by Herman, he was gunned down at home. The top of the sixth saw New York extend its lead to 3–1 when Tommy Henrich belted a double to right and scored on a Dickey single. The Cubs could muster nothing further off Ruffing, who scattered nine hits over the course of the game, and the Yankees held on for the win and a 1–0 lead in the Series.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 pitted the Yankees' Lefty Gomez against former St. Louis Cardinals ace Dizzy Dean, who had been traded to Chicago in April and won seven of his eight regular-season wins for his new team on finesse after having lost his fastball by changing his pitching motion to avoid putting weight on the toe he had fractured during the 1937 All-Star Game (on a low line drive back to the mound by Earl Averill). Game 2 of the 1938 Series thus became known as \"Ol' Diz's Last Stand\".\nThe Cubs gave Dean a 1–0 lead in the bottom of the first inning when Hack singled, advanced to third on a single by Frank Demaree and scored on Joe Marty's fly ball. But the Bronx Bombers took the lead in the next half-inning when a Gordon double scored both Joe DiMaggio and Gehrig. In the bottom of the third, the Cubs went back out in front by a run when Hack and Herman hit back-to-back singles, were sacrificed to third and second by Demaree, and scored on Marty's double.\nDean pitched effectively for the next four innings, giving up only a single to Gehrig in the fourth. But in the top of the eighth, the Yankees stormed back on a two-run homer by Frankie Crosetti that scored pinch-hitter Myril Hoag for a 4–3 Bomber lead, and DiMaggio added a two-run dinger of his own in the top of the ninth that scored Henrich. Johnny Murphy, in relief of Gomez, held Chicago at bay for the final two innings for a 6–3 Yankee win as the Series moved east to New York with a 2–0 Series advantage for the Yankees.\nGame 3.\nFor Game 3 at Yankee Stadium, the Cubs threw Clay Bryant against the Bombers' Monte Pearson. Both pitchers matched zeroes for the first four innings. In the top of the fifth, the Cubs drew first blood when Hack doubled, moved to third on Gordon's error on Phil Cavarretta and scored on Marty's forceout of Cavarretta at second. In the bottom half of the inning, however, Gordon atoned for his mistake by walloping a solo home run off Bryant to tie the game. Pearson followed with a single to right, advanced to second on a Crosetti walk and scored on a Red Rolfe single to give the Yankees a 2–1 lead.\nIn the bottom of the sixth, New York tacked on two more runs with a two-run single by Gordon. In the top of the eighth, the Cubs cut the lead in half when Marty hit a home run to notch his fifth RBI of the Series, but Dickey answered for the Yankees with a shot of his own in the bottom half. The Bombers held on for a 5–2 win and a 3–0 Series stranglehold.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 was a rematch of the Game 1 starters, Ruffing vs. Lee. Like the closely contested series opener, it stayed close until New York pulled away with four runs in the bottom of the eighth.\nIn the bottom of the second, the Yankees struck for three runs. Hoag reached on Hack's throwing error from the hot corner, and advanced to third on a Gordon single. Ruffing helped his own cause by singling in Hoag, and Crosetti's triple to left scored Gordon and Ruffing. The Cubs broke the shutout with a Billy Jurges fielder's choice scoring Demaree, but in the sixth the Bombers got the run back with Henrich's solo homer off veteran Cub reliever Charlie Root.\nIn the top of the eighth, the Cubs cut the New York lead to one with a Ken O'Dea home run scoring Cavarretta ahead of him. But in the bottom half, the Yankees broke the game open with a four-run outburst off four Cub pitchers—Vance Page, Larry French, Tex Carleton and Dean. Crosetti drove in two with a double off Dean, giving him four RBI for the game and six for the Series. As in Game 1, Ruffing went the distance, allowing two earned runs and eight hits with six strikeouts.\nThis was the last World Series game ever played by Yankee first baseman Lou Gehrig. He had one hit in four at-bats. Defensively he had five putouts and two assists.\nComposite line score.\n1938 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)\nUmpires.\nUmpires Cal Hubbard and Lou Kolls were selected from the American League while Charley Moran and Ziggy Sears were chosen from the National League by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis."

        "title": "1943 World Series",
        "text": "The 1943 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1943 season. The 40th edition of the World Series, it matched the defending champion St. Louis Cardinals against the New York Yankees, in a rematch of the 1942 Series. The Yankees won the Series in five games for their tenth championship in 21 seasons. It was Yankees manager Joe McCarthy's final Series win. This series was also the first to have an accompanying World Series highlight film (initially, the films were created as gifts to troops fighting in World War II, to give them a brief recap of baseball action back home), a tradition that persists.\nThis World Series was scheduled for a 3–4 format because of wartime travel restrictions. The 3–4 format meant there was only one trip between ballparks, but if the Series had ended in a four-game sweep, there would have been three games played in one park and only one in the other.\nBecause of World War II, both teams' rosters were depleted. Johnny Beazley, Jimmy Brown, Creepy Crespi, Terry Moore and Enos Slaughter were no longer on the Cardinals' roster. Joe DiMaggio, Phil Rizzuto, Red Ruffing and Buddy Hassett were missing from the Yankees, and Red Rolfe had retired to coach at Dartmouth College.\nCardinals pitchers Howie Pollet, Max Lanier and Mort Cooper ranked 1–2–3 in the National League in ERA in 1943 at 1.75, 1.90 and 2.30, respectively.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn Game 1, the Cardinals went up 1–0 in the second against Spud Chandler on Marty Marion's RBI double with two on. In the fourth inning, with runners on first and third and no outs off Max Lanier, Charlie Keller's double-play tied the game, then Joe Gordon's home run put the Yankees up 2–1. The Cardinals tied the game in the fifth inning when Ray Sanders hit a leadoff single, moved to second on an error and scored on Lanier's single. In the sixth inning, after two leadoff singles, a one-out wild pitch by Lanier put the Yankees up 3–2, then Bill Dickey added an insurance run with an RBI single. Chandler pitched a complete game to give the Yankees a 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nThe Cardinals' only victory came the same day as the death of Mort and Walker Cooper's father, Robert. Marty Marion's leadoff home run in the third off Tiny Bonham put the Cardinals up 1–0. In the fourth, Stan Musial hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Whitey Kurowski's RBI single. Ray Sanders's two-run home run then made it 4–0 Cardinals. In the bottom of the inning, Charlie Keller's sacrifice fly with two on off Mort Cooper put the Yankees on the board. In the ninth, Billy Johnson hit a leadoff double, then scored on Cooper's triple. After a line-out, Nick Etten's RBI groundout cut the Cardinals' lead to one, but Cooper got Joe Gordon to pop out in foul territory to end the game and tie the series 1–1.\nGame 3.\nThe Cardinals loaded the bases in the fourth on a single, double and intentional walk off Hank Borowy before Danny Litwhiler drove in two with a single to left, but Borowy allowed no other runs in eight innings. In the sixth, Borowy hit a leadoff double off Al Brazle, moved to third on a sacrifice fly, and scored on an error on Billy Johnson's groundball. In the eighth, the Yankees loaded the bases on a single, fielder's choice and intentional walk before Johnson cleared them with a triple, putting the Yankees up 4–2. They added to their lead on RBI singles by Joe Gordon off Howie Krist and Nick Etten off Harry Brecheen. Johnny Murphy pitched a perfect ninth as the Yankees went up 2–1 in the series.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, the Yankees struck first when Joe Gordon doubled with two outs in the fourth off Max Lanier and scored on Bill Dickey's single. In the seventh, Marius Russo got two outs, then allowed the Cardinals to load the bases on an error, double and intentional walk before another error on Frank Demaree's groundball tied the game. In the eighth, Russo hit a leadoff double off Harry Brecheen, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Frankie Crosetti's sacrifice fly. Russo pitched a complete game to leave the Yankees one win away from the championship.\nGame 5.\nMurry Dickson, who helped close the door for the Cardinals by allowing no hits while on the mound, was on a ten-day pass from the United States Army. Spud Chandler won his second complete game of the series, shutting out the Cardinals despite giving up 10 hits and two walks. Bill Dickey provided the game's only runs on a home run in the sixth after a two-out walk off Mort Cooper.\nComposite box.\n1943 World Series (4–1): New York Yankees (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1942 World Series featured the defending champion New York Yankees against the St. Louis Cardinals, with the Cardinals winning the Series in five games for their first championship since and their fourth overall.\nThe 1942 Cardinals set a franchise record for victories with 106. Every Cardinal—except for Harry Gumbert—was a product of the team's farm system, which had been put in place by Branch Rickey.\nThe Yankees won Game 1 despite a Cardinals rally, but the Cardinals swept the rest. The loss was the Yankees' first since the 1926 World Series, also to the Cardinals. They had won eight Series in the interim (a record for most consecutive series won between losses) and had won 32 out of 36 World Series games in that period, including five sweeps (1927 vs. the Pirates, 1928 vs. the Cardinals, 1932 and 1938 vs. the Cubs and 1939 vs. the Reds).\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn Game 1, Red Ruffing had a no-hitter until Terry Moore singled for St. Louis with two out in the eighth inning. The Yankees scored the game's first run in the fourth on Buddy Hassett's two-out double with two on off of Mort Cooper. Next inning with runners on second and third, Joe DiMaggio's fielder's choice made it 2–0 Yankees. In the eighth with two on, Hassett's single scored a run, then an error on Red Ruffing's fly ball scored two more. Red Rolfe singled to lead off the ninth off of Max Lanier and scored on an error on Roy Cullenbine's bunt attempt. Charlie Keller walked and an error on a pickoff attempt allowed Cullenbine to score. In the bottom of the ninth, with two on and two outs, Marty Marion put the Cardinals on the board with a two-run triple, then scored on Ken O'Dea's single. After Jimmy Brown walked, Spud Chandler relieved Ruffing and allowed an RBI single to Terry Moore. Another single loaded the bases, bringing Stan Musial to the plate as the potential winning run, only to have Musial ground out to end the game as the Yankees took a 1–0 series lead with a 7–4 win.\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, Walker Cooper's two-run double in the first, the Cardinals' first hit of the game, put them up 2–0 off of Tiny Bonham. In the seventh, innings Johnny Hopp singled and scored on Whitey Kurowski's triple to make it 3–0 Cardinals. Johnny Beazley pitched seven shutout innings, but in the eighth allowed a two-out single to Roy Cullenbine, who stole second and scored on Joe DiMaggio's single. A two-run home run by Charlie Keller then tied the score, but the Cardinals regained the lead in the bottom half when Enos Slaughter doubled with two outs and scored on Stan Musial's single. Slaughter threw out Tuck Stainback going from first to third on a single with no outs in the ninth. Beazley then retired the next two hitters to end the game as the Cardinals tied the series with a 4–3 win heading to New York.\nGame 3.\nErnie White pitched a six-hit shutout against New York, walking none. The last time the Yankees were shutout in a World Series game was by Jesse Haines in 1926. The Cardinals scored the game's first run in the third off of Spud Chandler on Jimmy Brown's groundout with runners on second and third, then added an insurance run in the ninth off of Marv Breuer on Enos Slaughter's RBI single with two on, the run unearned due to catcher Bill Dickey's error on Terry Moore's bunt attempt, to take a 2–1 series lead.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, the Yankees struck first in the bottom of the first when Red Rolfe doubled off of Mort Cooper and scored on Roy Cullenbine's single. In the top of the fourth, the Cardinals loaded the bases with no outs on two singles and walk before Whitey Kurowski's two-run single put them up 2–1. A walk loaded the bases before Cooper's two-run single made it 4–1 Cardinals. Atley Donald relieved starter Hank Borowy and allowed a one-out RBI single to Terry Moore and two-out RBI double to Stan Musial. In the bottom of the sixth, after a leadoff single and walk, Cullunbine's RBI single made it 6–2 Cardinals and one out later, Charlie Keller's three-run home run cut their lead to one. Harry Gumbert relieved Cooper and Joe Gordon reached first third baseman Kurowski's throwing error, then scored on Jerry Priddy's double to tie the game, but the Cardinals took the lead for good in the seventh. After two leadoff walks, an RBI single by Walker Cooper put them up 7–6, and Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly off of Tiny Bonham later that inning. The Cardinals added another run in the ninth Johnny Hopp hit a leadoff single, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on a single by Max Lanier, who pitched three shutout innings to close the game and earn the win, leaving the Cardinals one win away from the championship.\nGame 5.\nIn Game 5, Phil Rizzuto's leadoff home run in the bottom of the first off of Johnny Beazley put the Yankees up 1–0, but the Cardinals tied the score in the fourth on Enos Slaughter's leadoff home run off of Red Ruffing. The Yankees retook the lead in the bottom half when Red Rolfe hit a leadoff single, moved to third on an error and groundout and scored on Joe DiMaggio's single, but the Cardinals again tied the game in the sixth on two leadoff singles and a sacrifice fly by Walker Cooper. In the top of the ninth, Whitey Kurowski's two-run home run put the Cardinals up 4–2. Though the Yankees put two on in the bottom of the ninth on a single and error with no outs, Beazley picked off Joe Gordon at second and retired the next two batters to end the game and give the Cardinals the championship.\nComposite box.\n1942 World Series (4–1): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)"

        "title": "1963 World Series",
        "text": "The 1963 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1963 season. The 60th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion and two-time defending World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers; the Dodgers swept the Series in four games to secure their second championship title in five years, and their third in franchise history. Dodgers starting pitchers Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, and Johnny Podres, and ace reliever Ron Perranoski combined to give up only four runs in four games. The dominance of the Dodgers pitchers was so complete that at no point in any of the four games did the Yankees have the lead. New York was held to a .171 team batting average, the lowest ever for the Yankees in the postseason. Koufax was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\nThis was the first time that the Yankees were swept in a World Series in four straight (the 1922 World Series had one tie).\nOf the Los Angeles Dodgers' five World Series championships since the opening of Dodger Stadium, this was the only one won at Dodger Stadium. Also, of the seven championships from the Dodgers franchise, it remains the only one won at home. Their 2020 title was won as the \"home team\" albeit as part of the neutral site World Series in Arlington, Texas.\nThis series was also the first meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship. Seven more such meetings have followed with three more times each in the World Series and the NBA Finals, and the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals.\nBackground.\nYankees.\nDespite injuries that limited Mickey Mantle to just 65 games, the Yankees went 104–57 to win their fourth straight American League pennant—this one by games. Catcher Elston Howard (.287 BA, 28 HRs, 85 RBI) won the MVP Award, while Joe Pepitone, Roger Maris, and Tom Tresh also topped the 20 home run mark. Their pitching was anchored by Whitey Ford (24 wins, 2.74 ERA) and Jim Bouton (21 wins, 2.53 ERA).\nDodgers.\nThe Dodgers' road to the World Series was much more challenging. After blowing a four-game lead with seven to play in 1962, the Dodgers again built a lead in 1963. On August 21, the Dodgers beat the Cardinals 2–1 in 16 innings to take a game lead. When they went to St. Louis for a three-game series on September 16, their lead was one game over the Cardinals, who had won 19 of 20 games. Sports fans around the country were saying how the Dodgers were going to blow it again. But the Dodgers swept the three games from the Cardinals to move four games ahead with nine to play; a 4–1 win over the Mets clinched the pennant in the season's 158th game.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nSandy Koufax started it off with a record 15-strikeout performance in Game 1 to outduel the Yankees' ace left-hander Whitey Ford. The 15 strikeouts bested fellow Dodgers pitcher Carl Erskine's mark in 1953 by one, and would be surpassed by Bob Gibson in 1968 with 17. Koufax also tied a World Series record when he fanned the first five Yankees he faced.\nClete Boyer was the only Yankees regular not to strike out. Mickey Mantle, Tom Tresh and Tony Kubek each struck out twice, and Bobby Richardson struck out three times—his only three-strikeout game in 1448 regular season or World Series games. Koufax also struck out three pinch-hitters, including Harry Bright to end the game.\nFord set the Dodgers down in order in the first inning, but got into trouble in the second inning. With one out, right fielder Frank Howard doubled into left center field. A single by first baseman Bill Skowron plated Howard to give the Dodgers a 1–0 lead. Second baseman Dick Tracewski's single preceded a three-run home run by catcher John Roseboro to give the Dodgers a 4–0 lead.\nThe Dodgers upped the lead to 5-0 when Skowron singled home Willie Davis with two outs in the third inning against Ford, who went just five innings.\nThe Yankees scored twice in the eighth inning when Tony Kubek singled with one out and Tom Tresh homered with two outs to cut the lead to 5–2.\nGame 2.\nWillie Davis doubled in two runs in the first inning, former Yankee Bill Skowron homered in the fourth, and Tommy Davis had two triples, including an RBI triple in the eighth to lead the Dodger offense. Yankee starter Al Downing, who would take the loss, went only five innings and charged with three runs. Ralph Terry, in relief, allowed Davis's RBI triple. Dodger manager Walt Alston went with #3 starter Johnny Podres over #2 starter Don Drysdale because he was left-handed and Yankee Stadium was favorable to left-handed pitchers. Podres delivered a six-hitter through innings; ace reliever Ron Perranoski, also a left-hander, got the last two outs and the save, and the Dodgers headed home with 2–0 Series lead. Yankees right fielder Roger Maris left the game in the third after hurting his left arm running into the right field foul wall while chasing down Tommy Davis's first triple and would miss the final two games of the series.\nGame 3.\nDon Drysdale pitched a masterful three-hitter at Dodger Stadium in his complete-game win. Manager Walter Alston called Drysdale's performance \"one of the greatest pitched games I ever saw.\" Jim Bouton, making his first World Series start, dueled Drysdale throughout, permitting only four hits in seven innings for a losing cause. The lone run of the game came in the bottom of the first on a Jim Gilliam walk, a wild pitch and a single by Tommy Davis. Gilliam almost scored again in the eighth off Hal Reniff, but was caught in an attempt to steal third. The final out came on Joe Pepitone's drive that backed Dodger right fielder Ron Fairly up against the bullpen gate to make the catch of a ball that would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium. Tony Kubek had two of the Yankees' three hits, but none of the hits were extra-base hits.\nGame 4.\nAces were on the mound again in a game 1 rematch between Whitey Ford and Sandy Koufax. This time, it was a pitcher's duel. The Dodgers scored first in the bottom of the fifth on a monumental Frank Howard home run into the second (Loge) level at Dodger Stadium. The Yankees tied it on a Mickey Mantle home run in the top of the seventh. But in the bottom of the inning, Gilliam hit a high hopper to Yankee third baseman Clete Boyer; Boyer leaped to make the grab, and fired an accurate throw to first base. But first baseman Joe Pepitone lost Boyer's peg in the white-shirted crowd background; the ball struck Pepitone in the arm and rolled down the right field line, allowing Gilliam to scamper all the way to third base. He then scored a moment later on Willie Davis' sacrifice fly. Sandy Koufax went on to hold the Yankees for the final two innings for a 2–1 victory and the Dodgers' third world championship. To date, this is the only time the Dodgers have won the deciding game of a World Series at home. (The Dodgers won the 2020 World Series in Game 6 while they were designated as the home team, but the game was played at a neutral site, Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.)\nThe World Series Most Valuable Player Award went to Sandy Koufax, who started two of the four games and had two complete game victories. When the award was given to Koufax at a luncheon in New York City, he was presented with a new car—while the luncheon was taking place, a New York City police officer put a parking violation ticket on the car's windshield.\nComposite line score.\n1963 World Series (4–0): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)\nThe Yankees' four runs in the series was, at the time, the second-lowest total in a World Series, as the Philadelphia Athletics had scored only three runs in . The Los Angeles Dodgers would set a new low in , two runs."

        "title": "1952 World Series",
        "text": "The 1952 World Series featured the 3-time defending champions New York Yankees beating the Brooklyn Dodgers in seven games. The Yankees won their 4th consecutive title, tying the mark they set in 1936–1939 under manager Joe McCarthy, and Casey Stengel became the second manager in Major League history with 4 consecutive World Series championships. This was the Yankees' 15th World Series championship win, and the 3rd time they defeated the Dodgers in 6 years.\nIn Game 7, the Yankees' second baseman Billy Martin made a great catch, preserving the Yankees' two-run lead. Also, the home run hit by Mickey Mantle during the 8th inning of Game 6 was significant because it was the first of his record 18 career World Series home runs.\nMatchups.\nIn 1952 the Dodgers, led by manager Chuck Dressen, paced the NL in runs scored (775), home runs (153) and stolen bases (90). Duke Snider, Jackie Robinson and George Shuba batted over .300, while Roy Campanella (97) and Gil Hodges (102) paced the team in RBIs. The Dodgers had no dominant pitchers with Carl Erskine (206) the lone pitcher with over 200 innings and rookie Joe Black leading the team with 15 wins. Manager Dressen used 14 starting pitchers on the year, but as a unit, the pitchers combined to finish second in the NL in team ERA. Defensively, the Dodgers led the NL with a .982 fielding percentage, and Campanella gunned down 29 of 52 (56%) would-be base stealers.\nThe Yankees, led by the effusive Casey Stengel, recovered from the retirement of Joe DiMaggio, and the loss of Bobby Brown, Jerry Coleman and Tom Morgan to the service. The Yankees matched the Dodgers in hitting as they finished first or second in the AL in runs scored, home runs, batting average, and slugging percentage. Mickey Mantle had a breakout season leading the Yankees in batting (.311), and slugging (.530). Yogi Berra led the Yanks in runs (97), HRs (30) and RBIs (98). The Yankees had a pitching staff that led the AL in ERA (3.14). Allie Reynolds led the team with 20 wins and led the league with 2.08 ERA. Casey Stengel rotated his pitchers all year with seven having at least 12 starts, but none working more than 35 games. Defensive standout Phil Rizzuto led AL shortstops with 458 assists and made only 19 errors.\nGame 1.\nJoe Black pitched a complete game and became the first African-American pitcher to win a World Series game. Jackie Robinson's lead off home run in the second off of Allie Reynolds put the Dodgers up 1–0, but Gil McDougald tied the game with a lead off home run of his own in the third. Duke Snider's two-run home run in the sixth put the Dodgers back in front 3–1. The Yankees cut the lead to 3–2 on a Gene Woodling triple and Hank Bauer sacrifice fly in the top of the eighth, but Pee Wee Reese gave the Dodgers that run back with a two-out home run in the eighth off Ray Scarborough as Brooklyn won 4–2 to take a 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nVic Raschi's complete-game three-hitter and nine strikeouts dominated this game. He was behind 1–0 after a Roy Campanella RBI single in the third, then in the fourth, the Yankees tied it when Mickey Mantle doubled, took third on a groundout and scored on a Yogi Berra sacrifice fly off Carl Erskine. Next inning, Gil McDougald drew a leadoff walk, stole second and scored on Billy Martin's single to put the Yankees up 2–1. A five-run Yankee sixth broke it open. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases before Billy Loes relieved Erskine and allowed an RBI groundout to Joe Collins, RBI single to McDougald, and three-run home run to Martin to put the Yankees up 7–1. The series was tied 1–1 shifting to the Bronx.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, the Yankees struck first in the second on Eddie Lopat's RBI single with two on off Preacher Roe, but the Dodgers tied the game off Lopat in the third on Jackie Robinson's sacrifice fly with two on. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Pee Wee Reese's RBI single. In the eighth, after two leadoff singles, Andy Pafko's sacrifice fly made it 3–1 Dodgers. Yogi Berra's home run in the bottom of the inning cut the lead to 3–2, but in the ninth, Reese and Robinson singled, then (after Lopat was relieved by Tom Gorman) did a double steal. A passed ball allowed both to score to make it 5–2 Dodgers. Johnny Mize's home run in the bottom of the inning made it 5–3 Dodgers, but Roe retired the next two men to end the game and give the Dodgers a 2–1 series lead.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, the score was 1–0 in the eighth, a Johnny Mize home run in the fourth off Joe Black being the difference, when Dodgers reliever Johnny Rutherford came into the game. The first batter he faced was Mickey Mantle, who tripled to deep left-center, then kept coming home when the throw to third got away, scoring a key insurance run for the Yankees. Both sides got just four hits in the contest. Allie Reynolds pitched a complete-game shutout as the Yankees 2–0 win tied the series at two games apiece.\nGame 5.\nThe Dodgers struck first in the second off Ewell Blackwell on Andy Pafko's RBI single with two on. In the fourth, with runners on second and third, Pee Wee Reese's sacrifice fly made it 2–0 Dodgers, then Duke Snider's two-run home run extended their lead to 4–0. Carl Erskine pitched four shutout innings before the Yankees torched him in the fifth. After a walk and single, Irv Noren's RBI single and Gil McDougald's forceout scored a run each. After a single and pop out, Johnny Mize's three-run home run put the Yankees ahead 5–4. In the seventh, Billy Cox singled, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Snider's RBI single, tying the game off Johnny Sain. The game went into extra innings and in the top of the 11th, Billy Cox got his third hit of the game, moved up on a Pee Wee Reese hit and scored on Duke Snider's double off reliever Johnny Sain for what turned out to be the winning run. Erskine pitched all 11 innings for Brooklyn, retiring the last 19 batters he faced, closing it out by retiring future Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle, Johnny Mize and Yogi Berra 1-2-3. The Dodgers were one win away from a championship as the series returned to Brooklyn.\nGame 6.\nIn Game 6, with a 3–2 Series lead and the final two at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers looked to chase away the demons of 1951. Billy Loes (13–8) faced Vic Raschi (16–6). Dodgers Manager Chuck Dressen made a curious lineup change with George Shuba batting fifth, replacing Andy Pafko. Dressen placed Roy Campanella in the sixth spot and left Gil Hodges to bat seventh.\nIn the Dodgers half of the first inning, with Duke Snider on second and Jackie Robinson on first, Shuba grounded out to Billy Martin to end the inning. In the Yankees fourth, Yogi Berra reached second base when Pee Wee Reese uncorked a wild throw on a double-play attempt, but the Yankees could not capitalize. In the fifth inning, the Dodgers turned a remarkable double play. Yankee Irv Noren led off with a single, followed by a Vic Raschi bunt. Gil Hodges picked up the bunt, turned and fired to Reese at second, who in lightning succession fired to Robinson covering first just in time to retire Raschi. In the Dodgers sixth, Snider sent Raschi's first pitch over the of screen in back of right field and onto Bedford Avenue for 1–0 lead. In the top of the seventh, Yogi Berra matched Snider's home run with one of his own, again onto Bedford Avenue. Gene Woodling followed with a single and Dodgers pitcher Billy Loes balked him to second. Raschi then made up for his bunt-turned-double-play by getting a hit, literally off Loes. The ball ricocheted off Loes and into right field bringing Woodling home for a 2–1 lead. In another curious move Dressen allowed pitcher Billy Loes to hit for himself in the seventh. Loes singled and promptly stole second. But Raschi struck out Billy Cox to end the inning. Mantle led off the Yankees eighth inning with the first of his 18 World Series home runs. Mantle's shot set a record for home runs by one team and for both teams in a single Series at 13. Snider continued the home run fest by launching another one in the bottom of the eighth. Jackie Robinson then sent left fielder Gene Woodling to the wall for an out and Shuba doubled to send Raschi to the showers. Allie Reynolds relieved and quickly ended the Dodgers eighth. Reynolds, known as \"The Chief\", again made quick work of the Dodgers in the ninth including striking out Rocky Nelson, who had pinch-hit for Hodges, preserving the 3–2 win.\nGame 7.\nGame 7 pitted Joe Black (15–4) vs Eddie Lopat (10–5). Black, who came out of the Negro leagues and was not even on the Dodgers spring training roster, had already pitched a complete game win in Game 1 of the Series, pitched seven innings in a 2–0 loss in Game 4 and would be starting his third game in seven days. At that time there were no days off between games as both teams played in New York. For the Yankees, Billy Martin continued his solid play. Martin sat on the bench for most of the season's first two months and took over second base duties when Casey Stengel moved Gil McDougald from second to third base to replace military-bound Bobby Brown.\nPhil Rizzuto led off the Yankees fourth with a double and Johnny Mize singled him home for a 1–0 lead. In the Dodgers fourth, a single by Duke Snider followed by two consecutive sacrifice attempts by Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella, intended to move runners over, loaded the bases instead. Allie Reynolds replaced Lopat and retired Gil Hodges with a fly to left scoring Snider. Reynolds struck out George Shuba, then induced Carl Furillo to ground out, leaving Robinson at third and the game tied 1–1. In the fifth inning, Gene Woodling homered for the Yankees, and the Dodgers' Billy Cox doubled followed by a Pee Wee Reese single which tied the game at 2–2. Mickey Mantle demonstrated his penchant for coming up big in World Series play with a home run in the sixth inning and RBI single in the seventh (off Preacher Roe) to give the Bronx Bombers a 4–2 lead. The Brooklyn boys loaded the bases again in the seventh, when Vic Raschi walked Furillo, Cox singled and Reese walked. Stengel called on Bob Kuzava, who retired Snider, setting the stage for Billy Martin. With two out and the runners moving, Jackie Robinson popped-up to the right of the mound. Kuzava hesitated, looking to his fielders. Martin charged hard from his position deep at second and caught the ball off his shoetops, to end the inning and save as many as 3 runs. Kuzava then quickly put the Dodgers down in the eighth and ninth to give the Yankees their fourth consecutive World Championship.\nThe Yankees batted .216 and the Dodgers only .215 in this tightly contested series.\nComposite line score.\n1952 World Series (4–3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1951 World Series matched the two-time defending champion New York Yankees against the New York Giants, who had won the National League pennant in a thrilling three-game playoff with the Brooklyn Dodgers on the legendary home run by Bobby Thomson (the Shot Heard 'Round the World).\nIn the Series, the Yankees showed some power of their own, including Gil McDougald's grand slam home run in Game 5, at the Polo Grounds. The Yankees won the Series in six games, for their third straight title and 14th overall. This would be the last World Series for Joe DiMaggio, who retired afterward, and the first for rookies Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle.\nThis was the last Subway Series the Giants played in. Both teams would meet again eleven years later after the Giants relocated to San Francisco. They have not played a World Series against each other since. This was the first World Series announced by Bob Sheppard, who was in his first year as Yankee Stadium's public address announcer. It was also the first World Series to be televised exclusively by one network (NBC) as well as the first to be televised nationwide, as coaxial cable had recently linked both coasts.\nBackground.\nThis World Series also matched up two of baseball's most colorful managers, Casey Stengel of the Yankees and Leo Durocher of the Giants.\nThis was the 13th appearance by the Giants in Series play, their ninth loss, and their first appearance since the 1937 World Series.\n\"The Commerce Comet arrives on the final voyage of the Yankee Clipper.\" (On the Yankees' side, the 1951 World Series was the first for Mickey Mantle and the final for Joe DiMaggio.)\nMantle's bad luck with injuries in the Major Leagues began here. In the fifth inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium, Mays flied to deep right center. DiMaggio and Mantle converged on the ball, DiMaggio called Mantle off, and Mantle stutter-stepped, catching a cleat in a drain cover, and fell to the ground in a heap with a wrenched knee as DiMaggio made the catch. Mantle was done for this Series, but would come back to play many more.\nNew York City became the first city to host an NBA Finals and a World Series in the same calendar year.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nMonte Irvin's daring baserunning got the Giants off to a fast start in this New York – New York series. He singled in the first inning, sped to third on Whitey Lockman's RBI single, then stole home off Yankee starter Allie Reynolds. The Yankees cut the Giants' lead to 2–1 in the second when Gil McDougald doubled with one out off Dave Koslo and scored on Jerry Coleman's single. The scored remained that way until the sixth when Alvin Dark's three-run home run gave the Giants a commanding 5–1 lead. Koslo pitched a complete game to give the Giants a 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nThe first three batters Larry Jansen faced were Mickey Mantle, Phil Rizzuto and Gil McDougald, all of whom singled for a quick 1-0 Yankee lead. It could have been worse, but the next batter Joe DiMaggio bounced into a 6-4-3 double play and Yogi Berra struck out. The next inning, Joe Collins's home run extended the Yankees' lead to 2–0. In the fifth Willie Mays flied out to Joe DiMaggio, who waved off right fielder Mantle, who got his spikes caught in an exposed drain and injured his knee and had to leave the game. This injury would stick with him for the rest of his career. Monte Irvin scored in the seventh, tagging and coming home on pinch-hitter Bill Rigney's bases-loaded sacrifice fly, as the Giants got within 2–1. But winning pitcher Eddie Lopat, who pitched a complete game, helped himself to an insurance run with an RBI single in the eighth after Bobby Brown hit a leadoff single and moved to second on a groundout off George Spencer. The Yankees' 3–1 win tied the series shifting to the Polo Grounds.\nGame 3.\nThe Giants struck first in Game 3 when Bobby Thomson hit a leadoff double and scored on Willie Mays' single in the second, then a five-run fifth inning was the undoing of Yankee starter Vic Raschi. Eddie Stanky walked with one out, moved to third on an error, and scored on Al Dark's single. After a Hank Thompson single, another error on Monte Irvin's fielder's choice allowed another run to score and put two on, then a Whitey Lockman three-run home run gave Giants starter Jim Hearn a comfortable 6–0 lead. The Yankees scored a run in the eighth on a bases-loaded walk to Joe Collins, then in the ninth on Gene Woodling's home run off Sheldon Jones, who retired the next two batters to end the game and give the Giants a 2–1 series lead.\nGame 4.\nIn the rain-delayed Game 4, the Giants again scored first when Al Dark doubled with one out in the opening inning off Allie Reynolds and scored on Monte Irvin's single, but the Yankees tied the game in the second on Joe Collins's RBI single with two on off Sal Maglie. After a single and walk, Reynolds's RBI single in the fourth put the Yankees up 2–1. Joe DiMaggio's first home run of the Series following a Yogi Berra single in the fifth extended their lead to 4–1. In the seventh, reliever Sheldon Jones allowed a single and walk, then an error on a pickoff attempt allowed one run to score before Gil McDougald's RBI single made it 6–1 Yankees. Reynolds allowed a one-out RBI single to Bobby Thomson in the ninth before getting Willie Mays to hit into the game-ending double play as the Yankees tied the series with a 6–2 win.\nGame 5.\nFor the third game in a row, the Giants scored first when Al Dark singled with one out in the first and scored on Monte Irvin's single aided by left fielder Gene Woodling's error, but starter Eddie Lopat kept them scoreless for the rest of Game 5 while the Yankees hammered Larry Jansen, Monty Kennedy and George Spencer. After two one-out walks in the third, Joe DiMaggio's RBI single tied the game, then after an intentional walk loaded the bases, Gil McDougald's grand slam off Jansen put the Yankees up 5–1. Next inning, Phil Rizzuto's home run off Kennedy after a walk extended their lead to 7–1. In the sixth, Rizzuto singled off Spencer before Yogi Berra's single and Johnny Mize's double scored a run each, making it 9–1 Yankees. In the seventh, a bases-loaded walk to Rizzuto forced in a run, then Al Corwin threw a wild pitch that let another run score before DiMaggio's two-run double capped the game's scoring at 13–1 Yankees, who were a win away from the World Series championship as the series returned to Yankee Stadium.\nGame 6.\nThe Yankees struck first in Game 6 on Gil McDougald's bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the first off Dave Koslo. The Giants tied the game in the fifth off Vic Raschi when Willie Mays hit a leadoff single, moved two bases on a wild pitch and sacrifice fly, and scored on Eddie Stanky's sacrifice fly. Playing right field in place of Mickey Mantle, Hank Bauer benefited from a tricky Yankee Stadium wind—as well as the umpire's generous call of a ball on Dave Koslo's two-strike pitch—to belt a bases-loaded triple in the sixth inning that would be the difference. Bauer also ensured that the lead held up. Trailing 4–1 in the ninth, the Giants loaded the bases with no outs on three singles off Johnny Sain. Enter reliever Bob Kuzava, acquired in June from the Washington Senators. After two sacrifice flies and the score now 4–3, pinch hitter Sal Yvars hit a sinking liner to right. The stadium crowd gasped as Bauer momentarily lost the ball in the crowd's white shirts and the shadows. But he located it again and charged forward. Bauer, who played in nine World Series and always came through when it mattered most, slid on his knees to catch the ball inches off the ground to end the game and the 1951 World Series. Game 6 was the last baseball game ever played by Joe DiMaggio.\nComposite line score.\n1951 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)"

        "title": "1950 World Series",
        "text": "The 1950 World Series was the 47th World Series between the American and National Leagues for the championship of Major League Baseball. The Philadelphia Phillies as 1950 champions of the National League and the New York Yankees, as 1950 American League champions, competed to win a best-of-seven game series.\nThe Series began on Wednesday, October 4, and concluded Monday, October 9. The Phillies had home field advantage for the Series, meaning no games would be played at the Yankees' home ballpark, Yankee Stadium, until game 3. The Yankees won their 13th championship in their 41-year history, taking the Series in a four-game sweep. The final game in the Series resulted in the New York Yankees winning, 5–2 over Philadelphia. It was the only game in the Series decided by more than one run. The 1950 World Series title would be the second of a record five straight titles for the New York Yankees (1949–1953). The two teams would not again meet in the Series for 59 years.\nThis was also the last World Series to have no American born black players until 2022, as neither club had integrated in 1950. It was also the last World Series where television coverage was pooled between multiple networks: earlier that year the Mutual Broadcasting System, which had long been the radio home for the World Series, purchased the exclusive TV rights for the following season despite not (and indeed, never) having a television network. They would eventually sell on the rights to NBC, beginning a long relationship with the sport for that network.\nThe Yankees and Phillies faced each other again 59 years later in the 2009 World Series, in which the Yankees also won, this time in six games to win their 27th World Series championship.\nTeams.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nThe Phillies, a particularly young team which came to be known as the \"Whiz Kids\", had won the National League pennant in dramatic fashion on the final day of the season to garner their second pennant—their first in 35 years. But writing in \"The New York Times\" on October 3, 1950, John Drebinger picked the Yankees to win the Series in five games: \"The Stengelers simply have too much over-all pitching. They have the long range power. They rare defensive skill, and they have the poise and experience gained through the past four years which brought them two world championships and three pennants.\" Odds makers made the Yankees 2–5 favorites to win the Series.\nCurt Simmons, a 17-game winner for the Phillies in 1950, had been called to military duty in September and was unavailable for this Series. Simmons was stationed at Camp Atterbury and requested and was granted a leave on October 4 to attend the Series. The Phillies chose not to request that Commissioner Chandler rule Simmons eligible for the Series but Simmons chose to attend to support the team. Simmons' place on the Series roster was taken by pitcher Jocko Thompson. Phillies ace Robin Roberts didn't start Game 1 because he had had three starts in five days including the pennant winner on the final day of the regular season—played October 1, 1950 (three days before Game 1).\nNew York Yankees.\nThe AL champion Yankees finished the regular season with a record of 98–56, three games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. Offensive team leaders were Phil Rizzuto (.324 batting average), Joe DiMaggio (32 home runs, .585 slugging percentage, and .979 OPS), and Yogi Berra (124 RBIs). Pitcher Vic Raschi led the team in wins, with a 21–8 record, and innings pitched. Rizzuto was voted the American League MVP, while Berra finished third, Raschi seventh, and DiMaggio ninth.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nBecause his #1 starter, Robin Roberts, had just pitched in three of the last five games of the frantic 1950 pennant race, Phils manager Eddie Sawyer surprised the world by naming his bullpen ace, Jim Konstanty, to open on the mound for Philadelphia, opposing 21-game winner Vic Raschi of the Yankees. Konstanty was outstanding, allowing just four hits and a run in eight innings, but Raschi was tougher, shutting out the Phils on only two hits en route to a 1–0 victory in the opener. The game's only run came in the fourth when Bobby Brown hit a leadoff double and scored on two fly-outs, the last one a sacrifice fly by Jerry Coleman. This marked the third consecutive year that the World Series opened with a 1–0 game, and the third consecutive year a two-hitter was thrown in the opening game of the World Series.\nGame 2.\nIn what would be the last postseason game ever played in Shibe Park, 20-game winner Robin Roberts and Allie Reynolds both pitched outstanding baseball for nine innings, as strong pitching and stout defense again prevailed in the Series. Gene Woodling drove in Jerry Coleman, who walked with two outs and moved to second on a single, with an RBI single for a Yankee run in the second, and Richie Ashburn's sacrifice fly scored Mike Goliat from third in the fifth, forcing a 1–1 tie which held up through nine full innings. This set the stage for Joe DiMaggio, leading off the tenth inning for the Yankees. With one swing, DiMaggio smashed a home run to left field to provide the difference in a 2–1 extra-inning win for the Yankees as the Series shifted to New York.\nDiMaggio had a hand in holding the Phillies at bay long enough to get his key at-bat. Leading off the sixth inning, Del Ennis hit a deep fly to center, but DiMaggio made a spectacular over-the-shoulder running catch, near the marker at the base of the scoreboard in right-center. This play is far less well-known but was similar-looking to the famous Willie Mays catch in the 1954 World Series. DiMaggio made this play on the road, although in a ballpark which he played in during the regular season (Shibe Park was also the home of the Philadelphia A's). Because there was nobody on when the ball was hit, he was not in a hurry to get the ball back to the infield (Mays' famous 1954 catch was deeper, with two runners on base and nobody out when the ball was hit).\nGame 3.\nPhils lefty Ken Heintzelman started the third game against Yankee stalwart Eddie Lopat. The Yankees struck first in the third when Phil Rizzuto walked with two outs, stole second and scored on a single by Jerry Coleman, who was tagged out at second to end the inning. In the sixth, Del Ennis doubled with two outs and scored on Dick Sisler's single to tie the game. Next inning Granny Hamner hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Mike Goliat's single to put the Phillies up 2–1. Heintzelman continued the Phils' great pitching into the eighth inning, when he lost control and walked the bases loaded after two outs. Konstanty relieved him and got Bobby Brown to ground to shortstop Granny Hamner, but Hamner misplayed the ball to allow the tying run to score. Russ Meyer came on for the Phillies in the last of the ninth. After retiring the first two batters, Meyer allowed consecutive singles to set the stage for Jerry Coleman, who drove in the winning run with a base hit to give the Yankees a 3–2 win.\nIn attendance at the game was Grover Cleveland Alexander, who had led the Phillies to their previous pennant in 1915. It was his first World Series game in 20 years. Ill from the effects of long term alcohol abuse, Alexander was generally ignored. He would be dead less than a month later on November 4, 1950, at age 63.\nGame 4.\nPhillies starter Bob Miller matched up against rookie Whitey Ford, making his first World Series appearance, as the Yankees tried to wrap up the Series in four straight. New York scored two runs in the first inning when Gene Woodling reached when second baseman Mike Goliat misplayed his ground ball, moved to second on a ground ball, and scored on Yogi Berra's single. After a wild pitch, Joe DiMaggio's RBI double made it 2–0 Yankees. Berra hit a leadoff home run in the sixth off of Jim Konstanty, who then hit DiMaggio with a pitch. After a groundout, Bobby Brown's RBI triple and Hank Bauer's sacrifice fly made it 5–0 Yankees. The first two Phils reached base in the ninth via a single and hit-by-pitch before Ford got the next two outs. Andy Seminick then flied to left, but left fielder Gene Woodling dropped what looked like the Series-ending out, allowing two runs to score. Mike Goliat kept the inning going with a hit, and Stengel removed Ford to bring in Allie Reynolds. Reynolds struck out pinch-hitter Stan Lopata, giving the Yanks a 5–2 win and the World Series victory.\nThe Phillies failed to hit a home run in the entire World Series. No other team has matched that dubious feat since.\nComposite box.\n1950 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.)\nThe winning margin of six runs remains the lowest for a four-game sweep, later equaled in 2005."

        "text": "The 1962 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1962 season. The 59th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the defending American League (AL) and World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants. The Yankees won the series in seven games for the 20th championship in team history. It is best remembered for its dramatic conclusion in Game 7; with runners on second and third base and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Giants’ Willie McCovey hit a hard line drive that was caught by Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson to preserve New York's one-run victory. Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\nThe Giants had won their first NL pennant since 1954 and first since moving from New York in 1958. They advanced by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-game playoff. The Giants had a higher cumulative batting average (.226 to .199) and lower earned run average (2.66 to 2.95), had more hits (51 to 44), runs (21 to 20), hit more home runs (5 to 3), triples (2 to 1) and doubles (10 to 6), yet lost the Series. They would not return to the World Series for another 27 years.\nThe Yankees had won their first World Series in 1923; of the 40 Series played between 1923 and 1962, the Yankees won half. After a long dominance of the World Series picture, the Yankees would not win another World Series for 15 years despite appearances in 1963, 1964, and 1976.\nThis World Series, which was closely matched in every game, is also remembered for its then-record length of 13 days, caused by postponements due to rain in both cities.\nSummary.\nNOTE: the series was originally scheduled to begin October 3, but was moved back one day due to the three-game playoff between the Giants and Dodgers to determine the National League pennant.&lt;br&gt;\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nRoger Maris' two-run double in the first inning off Billy O'Dell set up Yankee starter Whitey Ford with a lead, but Willie Mays scored for the Giants on Jose Pagan's single in the second, ending Ford's record World Series consecutive scoreless inning streak at . Chuck Hiller's double and Felipe Alou's single in the third tied the game, but the Yankees broke the tie in the seventh on Clete Boyer's home run. Next inning, Dale Long followed a single and hit-by-pitch with an RBI single to make it 4–2 Yankees and knock O'Dell out of the game. Boyer's sacrifice fly off Don Larsen extended their lead to 5–2. The Yankees got a final run in the ninth on Elston Howard's RBI single off Stu Miller, the run charged to Larsen. Ford's complete-game victory was the first of six in the series, four for the Yankees and two for the Giants.\nGame 2.\nThe Giants scored two runs in Game 2, in the first when Chuck Hiller hit a leadoff double off Ralph Terry and scored on two ground outs, then in the seventh when Willie McCovey smashed a tremendous home run over the right-field fence to boost 24-game winner Jack Sanford to a 2–0 shutout of the Yankees, who managed only three hits.\nGame 3.\nThe Yankees ended a scoreless tie in the seventh with three runs. After two leadoff singles, Roger Maris drove a base hit off starter Billy Pierce for two runs, then after moving to third on a sacrifice fly, he scored the eventual winning run on Clete Boyer's groundout off Don Larsen when the Giants were unable to turn an inning-ending double play. Giants catcher Ed Bailey's two-run home run in the top of the ninth off Bill Stafford left them a run short.\nGame 4.\nFor the second time in as many games, a Giants catcher stroked a two-run home run, when Tom Haller hit one off Whitey Ford in the second inning. After the Yankees tied the score at 2–2 in the sixth on back-to-back walks off reliever Bobby Bolin followed by back-to-back RBI singles by Bill Skowron and Clete Boyer, second baseman Chuck Hiller hit the first National League grand slam in World Series history in the seventh off Marshall Bridges with two of the runs charged to reliever Jim Coates. The Giants scored another run in the ninth off Bridges when Matty Alou hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Chuck Hiller's single. The Yankees got that run back on three straight two-out singles off Billy O'Dell, the last an RBI single by Tom Tresh, but Mickey Mantle hit into a forceout to end the game as the Giants won 7–3. This game marked the only World Series appearance for Juan Marichal, who started for the Giants. Marichal smashed the thumb on his pitching hand while attempting to bunt in the top of the fifth, and was placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the series.\nDon Larsen was the winning pitcher in relief, six years to the day after (and in the same stadium of) his perfect game in the 1956 World Series.\nThe Giants' win tied the series at two games apiece and guaranteed a return trip to San Francisco.\nGame 5.\nGames 5 and 6 were postponed by rain. Game 5 at New York was pushed back one day, but Game 6 in San Francisco was pushed back four days due to torrential rain on the West Coast. Three of the longest World Series in terms of total days, due to various postponements, involved the Giants: the 1911 and the 1989 were the other two.\nIn Game 5, hot-hitting José Pagán hit a leadoff single in the third off Ralph Terry, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, then scored on Chuck Hiller's RBI single. After a wild pitch from Jack Sanford tied the game in the fourth, Pagan's home run in the fifth put the Giants back in front 2–1, but another wild pitch in the sixth by Sanford tied the game again. In the eighth, Bobby Richardson and Tony Kubek hit back-to-back singles before Tom Tresh hit the game-winning three-run home run. The Giants scored a run in the ninth when Willie McCovey hit a leadoff single and scored on Tom Haller's one-out double, but Terry retired the next two hitters to end the game. With the series returning to San Francisco the Yankees had the edge, three games to two, only to have the sixth game delayed four days by rain.\nGame 6.\nIn a battle of left-handed starting pitchers, Billy Pierce outdueled Whitey Ford with a complete-game three-hitter as the Giants evened the series at three wins apiece with a 5–2 victory. They struck first in the fourth when after a single and walk, an error on an attempted pickoff by Ford allowed a run to score, then Orlando Cepeda's double and Jim Davenport's single scored a run each. They added to their lead next inning on RBI singles by Felipe Alou and Cepeda. The Yankees' only runs came on a Maris home run in the fifth inning and an RBI single by Tony Kubek in the eighth inning after a one-out double.\nGame 7.\nThe only run of this classic game came in the fifth inning when Tony Kubek grounded into a double play, Bill Skowron scoring from third. Ralph Terry, pitching the seventh game instead of Jim Bouton because of the rain delays, had given up Bill Mazeroski's Series-winning walk-off home run two years earlier in Pittsburgh, but in his third start stifled the Giants' power hitters. In the bottom of the ninth, pinch-hitter Matty Alou, batting for reliever Billy O'Dell, led off the inning with a bunt hit after first having a foul ball dropped, but Terry struck out the next two batters, Felipe Alou and Hiller. Mays hit a double into the right-field corner, but Maris played the carom well, then hit cutoff man Richardson with a throw that was quickly relayed home. Alou, aware of Maris' strong arm, stopped at third. Facing Willie McCovey with two outs, Terry elected to pitch to him rather than walk the bases loaded, which would have brought up slugger Orlando Cepeda. Terry's inside fastball on the second pitch handcuffed McCovey, who nonetheless adjusted his bat in mid-swing to extend his arms and hit what he later claimed was the hardest ball he had ever struck. The line drive appeared at first to be going over the head of a well-positioned Richardson, but was in fact sinking from topspin and Richardson made the catch without leaping to end the game and the series. Had Richardson not made the catch, McCovey's hit would have driven in Alou for the tying run and quite possibly Mays as the winning run. Terry was named the World Series MVP.\nThe Yankees won their 20th World Series; they would not win another until 1977. The Giants would not win another National League pennant until 1989, when they would lose the World Series to the Oakland A's in a series interrupted by a major earthquake. San Francisco returned to the World Series in 2002 but lost in seven games to the Anaheim Angels. The San Francisco Giants would finally win the World Series for the first time in 2010 (against Texas) their first since 1954 when they were still located in New York. They would go on to win two more in 2012 (against Detroit) and again in 2014 (against Kansas City).\nComposite box.\n1962 World Series (4–3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over San Francisco Giants (N.L.)\nAftermath.\nThe season was a high-mark for Dark in San Francisco, despite some close brushes for further success. Despite winning 88 and 90 games in the next two years, the Giants could only take solace in finishing in the top division of the National League (until division play was instituted in 1969), and Dark was fired after the 1964 season; until 1972, the Giants would finish fourth or better but not win another pennant until 1989. The Yankees would win two further pennants in the 1960s, which included trips to the Series for Houk and then Berra when the former moved to the front office; the Yankees lost both times before the Yankee dynasty soon began to crumble under the chains of retiring players and new management, which resulted in a decade long drought.\nFor the \"Peanuts\" comic strip of December 22, 1962, cartoonist and Giants fan Charles M. Schulz depicted Charlie Brown sitting glumly with Linus, lamenting in the last panel, \"Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?\" The January 28, 1963, strip featured a nearly identical scene, except in the last panel Charlie Brown moaned, \"Or why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball even \"two\" feet higher?\"\nDuring the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Giants radio flagship KNBR rebroadcast Game 7, electronically re-editing NBC Radio announcer George Kell's description to make it sound as if McCovey's ninth-inning liner had gotten past Richardson, with Alou and Mays scoring to win the game and Series for San Francisco.\n48 years later, following additional World Series losses in and , the Giants would finally bring the first Series championship to San Francisco in . During Ring Night ceremonies in April 2011, Mays, McCovey, and Cepeda received honorary 2010 World Series rings."

        "title": "1961 World Series",
        "text": "The 1961 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1961 season. The 58th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees (109–53) against the National League (NL) champion Cincinnati Reds (93–61). The Yankees won in five games to earn their 19th championship in 39 seasons. Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford was named the World Series Most Valuable Player, having won two games while throwing 14 scoreless innings.\nThis World Series was surrounded by Cold War political puns pitting the \"Reds\" against the \"Yanks.\" The louder buzz concerned the \"M&amp;M Boys\", Yankees hitters Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, who had spent the season pursuing Babe Ruth's single-season home run record set in 1927; Mantle finished with 54 while Maris set the record of 61 on the last day of the season.\nThe Yankees were under the leadership of first-year manager Ralph Houk, who had succeeded Casey Stengel. The Yankees won the AL pennant, finishing eight games better than the Detroit Tigers. The Yankees also set an MLB record for most home runs in a season with 240. Along with Maris and Mantle, four other Yankees, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, Bill Skowron, and Johnny Blanchard, hit more than 20 home runs. The pitching staff was led by the Cy Young Award-winner Ford (25–4, 3.21 earned run average).\nThe underdog Reds, skippered by Fred Hutchinson, finished four games ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL and boasted four 20-plus home run hitters of their own: NL MVP Frank Robinson, Gordy Coleman, Gene Freese and Wally Post. The second-base, shortstop, and catcher positions were platooned, while center fielder Vada Pinson led the league in hits with 208 and finished second in batting with a .343 average. Joey Jay (21–10, 3.53) led the staff, along with Jim O'Toole and Bob Purkey.\nFord left the sixth inning of Game 4 due to an injured ankle. He set the record for consecutive scoreless innings during World Series play with 32, when, during the third inning he passed the previous record holder, Babe Ruth, who had pitched consecutive scoreless innings for the Boston Red Sox in and . Ford would extend that record to in the 1962 World Series.\nThe 1961 five-game series was the shortest since , when the New York Giants swept the Cleveland Indians in four games. These two teams would meet again 15 years later in the 1976 World Series, which the Reds would win in a four-game sweep.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nAt Yankee Stadium, Whitey Ford tossed his third straight World Series shutout. A fourth-inning shot into the lower right-field stands by Elston Howard was all Ford would need. Moose Skowron added a sixth-inning shot into the lower left-field to make it 2–0. The two-hour, 11-minute game featured only two hits by the Reds, a first-inning single to left by Eddie Kasko and a fifth-inning single by Wally Post. The only other Reds baserunner was Frank Robinson, who walked in the seventh. Otherwise, Ford had six strikeouts. Jim O'Toole allowed six hits in seven innings.\nFord was also aided by two excellent defensive plays by third baseman Clete Boyer. In the second inning, Boyer backhanded a Gene Freese ground ball close to the bag, wheeled, and threw out his third-base counterpart from his knees. In the eighth, Boyer dove to his left onto his stomach after a Dick Gernert ground ball; coming up with the ball, Boyer threw Gernert out, also from his knees.\nGame 2.\nThe Reds came charging back on superb pitching by Joey Jay to win Game 2 and even the series. Reds first baseman Gordy Coleman and Yankees' left-fielder Yogi Berra traded two-run homers in the fourth. Coleman hit his homer into the right-center field bleachers after Frank Robinson reached on an error by Yankees' third-baseman Clete Boyer. After Roger Maris led off the bottom half of the inning with a walk, Berra tied the score with a drive into the lower right-field stands.\nFrom there, Jay would give up only two more hits, a Berra single in the sixth and a Tony Kubek single to center in the eighth. The Reds continued to score with single runs in the fifth and sixth and two in the eighth. The Reds went ahead for good with two outs in the fifth when Elio Chacón sprinted home from third on an Elston Howard passed ball that didn't get much further than away. Yankee starter Ralph Terry would give up one more run in the sixth on a Wally Post double and a run- scoring single by eighth-place hitter Johnny Edwards, before being lifted in the seventh for pinch-hitter Héctor López.\nLuis Arroyo took over in the eighth and walked Robinson, gave up an infield single to Coleman on a roller between third and the mound and then threw wild to first, with Robinson scoring; Coleman was thrown out trying for third. The next batter, Wally Post, reached safely when Berra misplayed his fly for a three-base error. With Post on third, Gene Freese was intentionally walked for the second time in the game and Edwards followed with his second hit, a bloop double to left, scoring Post. Jay would seal the victory for the Reds by retiring six of the remaining seven batters, allowing only a walk to Clete Boyer in the ninth.\nThe series shifted to Cincinnati with the pressure on New York. After falling to a perceived inferior team (the Pittsburgh Pirates) in the 1960 World Series, a loss that cost long-time manager Casey Stengel his job, fans and media were wondering if it could happen again as the Yankees limped into Cincinnati with the series tied, having scored a total of just four runs and 10 hits in the first two games as several of the Yankee hitters struggled including the \"M&amp;M Boys.\"\nGame 3.\nCincinnati hosted its first World Series in 21 years at Crosley Field. 99-year-old Dummy Hoy, a former Red and the oldest living former Major League player at the time, threw out the first pitch. He would die two months later following a stroke, five months short of his 100th birthday.\nGame 3 pitted New York's 23-year-old right-hander Bill Stafford against Reds' veteran knuckleballer Bob Purkey. Stafford pitched well for innings. Purkey also had outstanding control and kept the Yankee hitters off balance, but New York triumphed on a Maris home run in the ninth. While the Yankees' offense still was stagnant, it was just good enough.\nCincinnati struck first with a run in the bottom of the third when Elio Chacón beat out a bunt and took second when Stafford threw wildly to first. Eddie Kasko fouled out to Bill Skowron and Vada Pinson grounded out to send Chacón to third before Frank Robinson hit a double off the left-field wall to make it 1–0.\nIn the seventh, the Yankees got a big break to tie the game. Tony Kubek led off with a single to center, then took second on a Johnny Edwards passed ball. After Mickey Mantle struck out, Yogi Berra blooped a ball into short right field that neither second baseman Chacón nor right fielder Robinson called before the two collided, allowing the ball to drop as Kubek scored. The Reds regained the lead in their half of the inning when Edwards doubled into the right-field corner and eventually scored on a Kasko single to left. Bud Daley came in to relieve Stafford and retired Pinson on a flyout to right to end the inning.\nThe Reds' lead was short-lived, as the Yankees tied the score in the eighth. With two outs, Johnny Blanchard (pinch-hitting for Daley), smacked a Purkey knuckler into the right-field bleachers. The Reds went quietly in the bottom of the inning, the score tied at 2–2.\nIn the ninth, Maris recorded the first of his only two hits in the Series, but this one went into the right-field bleachers for a go-ahead home run. With ace reliever Luis Arroyo on the mound for the Yankees in the ninth, the Reds had one last shot. After Gene Freese struck out, Leo Cárdenas, batting for Johnny Edwards, doubled off the left-center field scoreboard. Dick Gernert, pinch-hitting for Purkey, grounded to short, Cardenas holding. The third pinch-hitter in the inning, Gus Bell, ended the Reds' comeback attempt by grounding back to the mound, Arroyo to Skowron, to end the thriller and give the Yankees a two games to one Series lead.\nGame 4.\nWhitey Ford started Game 4 for the Yankees in an attempt to continue his post-season shutout streak, but more importantly to give the Bombers a 3–1 lead in the Series. He accomplished both. Ford retired the first nine batters of the game; when Elio Chacón grounded out to Bobby Richardson at second base for the final out in the third, Ford broke Babe Ruth's record of consecutive scoreless innings. Ford remained in the game until the end of the fifth, when an apparent ankle injury forced him to leave, his new record at 32 consecutive scoreless innings. Jim Coates entered the game in the sixth and pitched four scoreless innings.\nThe Yankees scored the game's first run in the fourth. Roger Maris led off with a walk and went to third on a single to left-center by Mickey Mantle. Elston Howard grounded into a double play, Maris scoring. The Yankees added another run in the fifth on a walk to Ford, a Bobby Richardson single to right-center and a run-scoring single by in Tony Kubek.\nIn the sixth, O'Toole was relieved by Jim Brosnan who got into a jam. With one out, Howard doubled to right-center. After Yogi Berra was intentionally walked, Skowron loaded the bases by beating out a slow roller to third. Clete Boyer then doubled to left to plate two runs. The Yankees put on the safety squeeze, only to have Ford bunt right to Reds first baseman Gordy Coleman who tagged first base. Boyer had moved to third and Skowron had come halfway home before stopping. Coleman then raced across the diamond and tagged Skowron, who was trapped between third and home, for an unassisted double play.\nThe Yankees would add three more runs in the seventh to put the game away. New York's seven-run output equaled what the Bronx Bombers were able to put up combined in their first three games as solid Reds starting pitching, combined with a wounded Mantle, kept the New York offense sputtering. That would change in Game 5.\nGame 5.\nFuture Hall-of-Famers Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle sat out Game 5, Berra with a stiff shoulder, Mantle still suffering from a hip abscess. But substitutes Héctor López and Johnny Blanchard more than made up for the absence of the two stars. Lopez drove in five runs with a triple, a home run and a sacrifice bunt, and Blanchard had three hits, including a double and a homer.\nIn the first four games, the Yankees scored a total of nine runs off Cincinnati's starting pitchers. In Game 5, New York scored five in the first inning. Reds starter Joey Jay, with 14 regular-season complete games, would uncharacteristically get just two outs before being relieved. After Bobby Richardson singled to start the game, Jay retired Tony Kubek and Roger Maris on fly balls. But the flood gates opened when Blanchard hit a two-run homer into the right-field bleachers. Elston Howard was awarded a ground-rule double when his blast went through an opening in the left-center field scoreboard. Bill Skowron followed with a long single off the left-field fence, scoring Howard. Jim Maloney entered the game and was greeted with a Lopez triple that scored Skowron. Clete Boyer continued the assault doubling off the scoreboard, scoring Lopez. The ninth batter of the inning, Yankee pitcher Ralph Terry mercifully struck out to end the inning but not until five Yankees had touched home plate.\nNew York added to its lead in the second on a Kubek single and a Maris double just inside the left-field line. The Reds cut the lead in half in the bottom of the third and chased Terry in the process. Don Blasingame led off with a single to center, Eddie Kasko singled to left and Vada Pinson hit a fly moving Blasingame to third. Frank Robinson then took Terry deep with a three-run shot over the right-center field fence. Bud Daley replaced Terry and shut the door on the Reds.\nThe Yankee offense added to its lead with five runs in the fourth, the big blows were a two-run single by Skowron and a three-run home run to dead center by Lopez. The Reds got a little closer after scoring two runs in the bottom of the fifth (on a two-run Wally Post home run) to cut it to 11–5. Then Yankees finished the rout by added two more runs in the sixth on sacrifices by Lopez (on a squeeze play) and Daley (on a fly ball).\nThis was the final World Series game ever played at Crosley Field, and the last postseason game in Cincinnati until the team moved to Riverfront Stadium in 1970\nHouk became only the third skipper in history to win the World Series in his first season.\nComposite line score.\n1961 World Series (4–1): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Cincinnati Reds (N.L.)"

        "title": "1959 World Series",
        "text": "The 1959 World Series featured the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers beating the American League champion Chicago White Sox, 4–2. Each of the three games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum drew record crowds, Game 5's attendance of 92,706 continues to be a World Series record to this day, and one that cannot feasibly be broken in any modern ballpark.\nThis was the first World Series played on the West Coast, outside Major League Baseball's traditional territory that stretched from Boston to Washington, D.C. in the East and to St. Louis in the Midwest from 1876 through 1955, the ended when the Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City. A West Coast World Series had become a possibility only a year before, when the Dodgers and the Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco (from Brooklyn and Manhattan, respectively) prior to the 1958 season.\nFor the White Sox, who had last won a championship in , it was their first World Series appearance since , when the team's unexpected loss to the Cincinnati Reds coincided with the Black Sox Scandal. This was the only World Series to be played in the City of Chicago in the between the Cubs' loss in and the White Sox next win in 2005. \nThe Dodgers won their first National League pennant since moving from Brooklyn after the 1957 season by defeating the Milwaukee Braves (another franchise that had relocated from their original city, Boston, in 1953) 2–0 in a best-of-three tie breaker series. The Dodgers' first world championship in Los Angeles, the win was their second World Series victory in franchise history and their second in five seasons, after beating the New York Yankees in 1955. \n1955 was their first win in the Fall Classic after seven consecutive losses between 1916 and 1953. While the Brooklyn Dodgers had gone 1–8 in the World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers have split their 12 appearances, going 6-6 between 1959 and 2020.\nIt was the first championship for a West Coast team, and it was the first World Series in which no pitcher for either side pitched a complete game. As Vin Scully remarked in his narration for the official World Series film, \"What a change of scenery!\" This was the only Fall Classic played during the period from 1949 through 1964 in which no games were played in New York City.\nRoute to the World Series.\nDodgers.\nAfter finishing seventh in 1958, the Dodgers rebounded in 1959. The National League pennant race was a season-long three-way battle between the Dodgers, the two-time defending N.L. champion Milwaukee Braves and the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers never led by more than two games (and that was at the end of a tie-breaker) and never trailed by more than five. On September 20, the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep in San Francisco so that, with five games to play, they had a game lead on the Braves and a one-game lead over the Giants. Going into the final day, the Dodgers and Braves were tied for first and the Giants were games back; the Giants needed to sweep a doubleheader from the Cardinals and have the Dodgers and Braves both lose to force a three-way tie. But the Dodgers won in Chicago 7–1 and the Braves won at home against the Phillies 5–2; this made the fact that the Giants lost both games of their doubleheader irrelevant.\nIn Game 1 of the best-of-three playoff in Milwaukee, the Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the top of the sixth inning. Dodger reliever Larry Sherry then retired 12 of the last 13 Braves hitters to secure the win.\nGames 2 and 3 (if necessary) were scheduled for Los Angeles. In Game 2, the Dodgers trailed 5–2 in the ninth inning, but rallied to tie the game with five singles and a sacrifice fly. In the top of the 11th, the Braves loaded the bases with two out, but Stan Williams got pinch hitter Joe Adcock to ground out to end the threat. In the bottom of the 12th, Gil Hodges drew a walk with two out and nobody on. Joe Pignatano singled Hodges to second. Carl Furillo hit a ground ball to shortstop Félix Mantilla; Mantilla's throw to first base was in the dirt and skipped past Frank Torre, allowing Hodges to score all the way from second with the pennant-clinching run.\nWhite Sox.\nManaged by Al López, the White Sox were built on pitching, speed and defense. Nicknamed the \"Go-go Sox\", they were last in the A.L. in home runs but led the league in stolen bases, fielding percentage, and lowest team ERA. They battled the Cleveland Indians for the American League pennant, and after a close race, the White Sox built a game lead in early September. The Indians could get no closer than games, and when the White Sox beat Cleveland 4–2 on September 22, they clinched the pennant with three games to play. The White Sox were only the second team besides the Yankees to win the A.L. pennant between 1949 and 1964 inclusive; the other was the 1954 Indians, also managed by Al López.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nHistoric Comiskey Park hosted a crowd of 48,103 that included Hollywood's Joan Crawford and Orson Welles and former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, the 1952 and 1956 Democratic presidential candidate for president.\nGame 1 was the first championship game in 40 years for the White Sox as well as the first postseason game in Chicago in 14 years, when the Chicago Cubs lost to the Detroit Tigers in Game 7 of 1945 World Series.\nOn the pitching mound, Early Wynn of the White Sox faced Roger Craig of the Dodgers. After scoring twice in the first inning on back-to-back RBI singles by Ted Kluszewski and Sherm Lollar after a walk and single, the Sox pounded across seven runs in the third. Nellie Fox doubled with one out and scored on Jim Landis's single before Kluszewski's two-run home run knocked Craig out of the game. Lollar reached second on an error off of Chuck Churn and scored on Billy Goodman's single. Then RBI doubles by Al Smith and Early Wynn and fielder's choice by Jim Rivera aided by two more errors made it 9–0 White Sox. Ted Kluszewski's second home run of the game off of Churn next inning capped the game's scoring as the Sox routed the Dodgers 11–0.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 featured Bob Shaw of the White Sox face Johnny Podres of the Dodgers. Once again, the Sox jumped out to a quick 2–0 lead in the first inning on Ted Kluszewski's RBI groundout with runners on first and third followed by Sherm Lollar's RBI single. In the fifth, Charlie Neal homered for the first Dodger run of the series. Chuck Essegian's two-out home run tied the game tied 2–2 in the seventh, then after a walk, Neal hit his second home run of the day to put the Dodgers ahead for the first time, 4–2. During a Sox uprising in the eighth against Larry Sherry, Al Smith doubled to left with two men on, cutting the lead to 4–3. However, Sherm Lollar was thrown out by a mile at the plate trying to score due to Wally Moon faking a catch that fooled Lollar. Sherry pitched a perfect ninth to notch a save and give the Dodgers the win.\nGame 3.\nIn contrast to the crowd of 36,528 for the tie-breaker playoff game at the Los Angeles Coliseum, 92,394 showed up for the first World Series game ever played on the West Coast. Dick Donovan faced off against the host team's Don Drysdale in Game 3. Six scoreless innings were thrown by the two, with Donovan giving up only one hit. However, Donovan would load the bases in the seventh inning on two walks and a single before being replaced by Gerry Staley. A single by Carl Furillo scored two runs. Drysdale allowed two singles and Larry Sherry hit a batter to load the bases with no outs in the eighth, but gave up just a run on Al Smith's double play. The Dodgers got that run back in the bottom half when Maury Wills hit a leadoff single off of Gerry Staley and scored on Charlie Neal's double. Sherry shut down the Sox in the ninth as the Dodgers won, 3–1 despite being outhit 12–5. The White Sox stranded 11 runners and were 0–for–7 with them in scoring position.\nGame 4.\nEarly Wynn and Roger Craig faced off against each other once again before a crowd of 92,650. Wynn was knocked out by a four-run Dodger third inning. Wally Moon singled with two outs and scored on Norm Larker's single. Larker, who moved to second on an error, scored on Gil Hodges's single. Hodges moved to third on a Don Demeter single and scored on a passed ball, then John Roseboro's RBI single capped the inning's scoring. The Sox tied the game in the seventh on Ted Kluszewski's RBI single with two on followed by Sherm Lollar socking a three-run home run, but Gil Hodges blasted one over the fence in the next inning off of Gerry Staley to give the Dodgers a 5–4 lead, then Larry Sherry pitched a scoreless ninth to put the Dodgers a win away from the World Series championship.\nGame 5.\nA record-breaking crowd of 92,706 turned out, a majority hoping to celebrate a Los Angeles championship. For the first time in World Series history, however, three pitchers combined for a shutout, as Bob Shaw, Billy Pierce and Dick Donovan quieted the Dodgers and their fans 1–0 in Game 5, sending the series back to Chicago. The game's only run scored in the fourth off starter Sandy Koufax, coming when Nellie Fox scored as Lollar grounded into a double play. To date, this remains the largest crowd in World Series history.\nGame 6.\nThe victory in Game 5 gave the Sox hope, heading back home to a \"real ballpark,\" as opposed to L.A.'s converted football stadium. But the change in scenery was no help. Early Wynn started with only two days rest, and after surrendering two runs in the third inning on Duke Snider's home run after a walk, the Dodgers broke open the game with six more in the fourth. Norm Larker hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Maury Wills's single. Wills scored on Johnny Podres's double to knock Wynn out of the game. Dick Donovan walked Jim Gilliam before allowing a two-run double to Charlie Neal and two-run home run to Wally Moon to make it 8–0 Dodgers. Starter Podres was also knocked out in the fourth by Chicago's last gasp, another towering three-run home run by the hottest Sox hitter, Ted Kluszewski, after a walk and hit-by-pitch. In the ninth inning, Chuck Essegian set a World Series record with his second pinch-hit home run of the Series off of Ray Moore, and the Dodgers captured their first championship as a Los Angeles team. Relief pitcher Larry Sherry (who earned the win in relief, finished with a 2–0 record on two saves and allowed one run in 12 innings) was voted Most Valuable Player of the Series.\nComposite line score.\n1959 World Series (4–2): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Chicago White Sox (A.L.)\nRecords and unique characteristics.\nThe Dodgers found an unlikely hero when Chuck Essegian, who hit only one home run in 1959 and had only six in his career to that point, set a World Series record with two pinch-hit home runs.\nDue to the best-of-three N.L. playoff, Game 1 was deferred from Wednesday, September 30, to Thursday, October 1. The normal travel days were retained between Games 2 and 3, and Games 5 and 6, resulting in the rare event of a Series with no Saturday game scheduled.\nGames 3, 4 and 5 were:\nThis was the first World Series to draw more than 400,000 fans.\nLarry Sherry of the Dodgers was the fifth consecutive pitcher to win the World Series Most Valuable Player Award (in only the fifth year it was awarded), following Johnny Podres (Brooklyn, 1955), Don Larsen (New York, 1956), Lew Burdette (Milwaukee, 1957), and Bob Turley (New York, 1958). Sherry, who had been born with club feet, finished all four games the Dodgers won, winning two and saving two. His brother Norm was the Dodgers' backup catcher.\nAlthough he was not voted MVP, Dodger second baseman Charlie Neal batted .370 for the Series, and his two-homer performance in Game 2 came after Chicago's pitching had held L.A. scoreless for 13 consecutive innings.\nTed Kluszewski played for the losing \"Pale Hose\" but still managed to drive in a World Series record-tying ten runs, joining Yogi Berra, who drove in ten in the 1956 World Series. \"Big Klu\" did so in just six games, and his 10 RBIs in the 1959 World Series remain a record for a 6-game World Series, as Berra's 10 RBIs in 1956 came in a 7-game World Series. (However, Bobby Richardson would break the record for RBIs in a World Series, regardless of length, the next year with 12 against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series.) \nThe Dodgers became the second National League team to win a World Series after relocating (the 1957 Milwaukee Braves being the first).\nThe Dodgers became the first team to go from 7th place in one season to World Champion the next.\nThe 1959 World Series was the last one for Comiskey Park, and the only one for Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The White Sox would move into Guaranteed Rate Field, originally \"New Comiskey\", in 1991; the Dodgers moved into Dodger Stadium in 1962. This was the last World Series to host the final World Series games of both its host venues until 2003, as the original Yankee Stadium closed following the 2008 Major League Baseball season and the Florida Marlins moved out of Sun Life Stadium after the 2011 season."

        "text": "The 1958 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1958 season. The 55th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees and the National League champion Milwaukee Braves. In a reversal from 1957, the Yankees defeated the Braves in seven games to win their 18th title, and their seventh in 10 years. With that victory, the Yankees became only the second team in Major League Baseball history to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series; the first was the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1925 (the 1903 Boston Americans came back from a 3–1 deficit in a best-of-nine affair). These teams would meet again in the fall classic 38 years later—by that time, the Braves had moved to Atlanta. As of , this is the most recent World Series featuring the two previous Series winning teams.\nBackground.\nThis was the first year New Yorkers had only one local team to root for; both the Giants and the Dodgers were now playing their home games more than away (in San Francisco and Los Angeles respectively). Both returnees to the Series had no problems repeating as league champions during the regular season. Milwaukee coasted to an eight-game lead over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League and the Yanks bested the Chicago White Sox by ten games in the American. With no pennant race in either league, managers Casey Stengel of the Yankees and Fred Haney of the Braves could rest their aces in preparation for an exciting repeat of the 1957 World Series.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nCasey Stengel called on 14-game winner Whitey Ford (14–7, 2.01) to start Game 1. Although teammate Bob Turley had a better regular season record at 21–7, the experienced, perennial winning southpaw Ford had five post-season victories under his belt. Fred Haney countered with a lefty of his own, 22-game winner Warren Spahn.\nBill Skowron started the scoring with a home run in the top of the fourth inning, but the Braves came storming back with two of their own in the bottom of the frame. Hank Aaron walked and quickly took second on a Yogi Berra passed ball. When Joe Adcock grounded out to third, Aaron held second but advanced to third on Wes Covington's groundout. Then came three straight singles, Del Crandall to left scoring Aaron, Andy Pafko to center, and Warren Spahn to left-center scoring Crandall, to put the Braves up by one.\nIn the top of the fifth, Spahn retired Tony Kubek on a flyout to left but walked the opposing pitcher, Ford. Leadoff hitter Hank Bauer then deposited a Spahn fastball into the left-field bleachers to give the Yankees a 3–2 lead. Milwaukee would tie the game in the eighth on an Eddie Mathews walk, Aaron double and sac-fly by Wes Covington on a deep fly-out to Mickey Mantle in left-center.\nWith no runs in the ninth, extra-innings were played, the Yankees going down 1–2–3 with Spahn still on the hill for the Braves. Ryne Duren, who came into the game to pitch the eighth inning, took his turn at-bat in the 10th and grounded out to the pitcher. Aaron started the bottom of the 10th by striking out and was barely thrown out at first base by Yogi Berra on a dropped third strike. Adcock followed with a clean single to center but Covington made the second out on a fly-out to left. Crandall then singled up the middle, sending Adcock to second base. Bill Bruton, who came into the game pinch-hitting for Pafko in the ninth, lined a single into right-center, scoring Adcock with the game-winning run.\nGame 2.\nLew Burdette (20–10, 2.91), who won three games in the 1957 World Series, took the mound for the Braves while the Yankees went with righty Bob Turley (21–7, 2.91), who won 20 games for the only time in his career during the regular season.\nBurdette started shakily, giving up a leadoff single to Hank Bauer. Eddie Mathews fielded a grounder by Gil McDougald but threw wide to the first, putting runners on second and third. Mickey Mantle was intentionally walked, loading the bases for cleanup hitter Elston Howard. Howard's groundout forced Mantle at second while Bauer came in from third with the game's first run. Burdette got the next batter, Yogi Berra, to ground into an inning ending 4–6–3 double-play; Red Schoendienst, to Johnny Logan, to Frank Torre.\nA shakier Bob Turley would last only a third of an inning. The Braves lit up the scoreboard with seven first inning runs, sparked by a leadoff Bill Bruton home run; he had hit just three in the season. Schoendienst doubled to right, Hank Aaron walked and dependable Wes Covington singled home a run to right-center. Mid-season pickup Duke Maas relieved Turley to get Frank Torre to fly to right for the second out. Del Crandall walked, loading the bases, with Johnny Logan keeping up the onslaught with a two-run single. With the score already 4–1, pitcher Burdette helped his own cause with a three-run homer that left-fielder Howard thought he had a bead on, only to crash into the fence. Burdette was just the sixth pitcher (to date) with a World Series home run. Norm Siebern was summoned to take over for Howard and Johnny Kucks came in to pitch to try to stop the bleeding. The tenth batter of the inning, Bruton, lined to short but the damage was done as the Braves were staked to a 7–1 lead.\nMilwaukee added to its lead in the second inning on another Covington single, this time scoring Eddie Mathews. Things would quiet down a little; Mickey Mantle's shot over the center-field fence in the fourth was the only other scoring until the seventh, when the Braves would score twice more and then thrice more in the eighth. The Yankees found some life in the top of the ninth, scoring three runs off a tiring Burdette. Hank Bauer led off with a home run, followed by a Gil McDougald single to left and then Mantle's second homer of the game, into the left-center field bleachers made it 13–5. Burdette showed some tenacity by retiring Berra, Bill Skowron, and Bobby Richardson, in order, for the win and a 2–0 series lead.\nGame 3.\nArriving at the Bronx for Games 3 through 5, the Yankees found themselves at home in hopes of their first win in this Series. Milwaukee was shut down on a finely pitched game by Don Larsen with a little help from reliever Ryne Duren.\nThe Yankees needed this win to stay within striking distance of the seemingly run-away Braves. Hank Bauer drove in all the Yankees' runs, going 3–for–4 with four runs batted in and scoring once. Bauer singled in Norm Siebern and Gil McDougald in the fifth, to extend his Series hitting streak to 17 games, and then in the seventh hit a two-run homer into the left-field stands. Larsen went seven innings on a six-hitter, striking out eight with three walks. Duren closed the game for his first save, pitching two scoreless innings with three walks and a strikeout. Bob Rush pitched well for the Braves, but his loss helped the Yanks get back into the Series.\nGame 4.\nWarren Spahn was at his much-needed best, winning Game 4 3–0 on a two-hit shutout over Yankee ace Whitey Ford. New York left-fielder Norm Siebern (playing for the injured Elston Howard), had trouble fielding with the afternoon sun blazing, losing fly balls in the sixth and eighth innings, accounting for two of Milwaukee's three runs.\nIt was a much-heralded pitching duel until the top of the sixth when Red Schoendienst led off tripling into deep left-center, the ball slicing between Mickey Mantle in center and Siebern in left. Tony Kubek, who had 28 errors during the season, let a Johnny Logan grounder slip through his legs for an error, letting in the game's first run. In the seventh, Spahn blooped a single to left to score Del Crandall, who was on third after Andy Pafko doubled to right. In the eighth, Logan was credited with a ground-rule double when Siebern lost a fly-ball in the sun. Eddie Mathews followed with a double off the right-center wall, scoring Logan with the game's final run.\nGame 5.\nGame 2 starters, loser Bob Turley and winner Lew Burdette, returned with quite different results. Elston Howard also returned to take his spot in left field back from the ineffective Norm Siebern.\nThe game did not start out very promising for the Yankees as the first six batters were retired without much fanfare. The Braves didn't fare much better as a walk and a single by Schoendienst in the third was all they could muster. Second baseman Gil McDougald would open up the scoring in the bottom of the third with a home run into the screen next to the left-field foul pole. Turley kept cruising retiring the side in order in the fourth and fifth until his Yankee teammates opened the floodgates with a six-run sixth. Burdette could only get one out in the inning giving up five earned runs before being relieved by Juan Pizarro.\nHank Bauer would lead off with a single to left. After Jerry Lumpe struck out bunting a third strike foul, Mickey Mantle singled to left-center advancing Bauer to third. Yogi Berra doubled into the right-field corner scoring Bauer, Mantle stopping at third. Howard was intentionally passed loading the bases but Moose Skowron kept the rally going with a short single to right scoring just Mantle. Pizzaro relieved Burdette, who was responsible for all baserunners, and was greeted with a two-run scoring double into the Milwaukee bullpen by Gil McDougald. With runners on second and third, Tony Kubek struck out but had to be thrown out by Del Crandall at first. Turley stayed in the game to hit and delivered a single to left scoring the sixth run, Skowron, and the seventh, McDougald. Hank Bauer was the third strikeout victim in the inning but six runs had crossed the plate. The Braves would put runners on in the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings but fail to score, giving the Yanks a 7–0 victory. Milwaukee still led 3–2 in the Series.\nGame 6.\nMilwaukee needed a split of two games at home to repeat as champions, but manager Fred Haney acted like his team had its back to the wall. Rather than start Spahn on three days' rest per his normal routine, the 37-year-old warhorse returned one day early. That also meant that Burdette would do the same if the series went to a seventh game. In the process, Haney bypassed veteran Bob Rush, who had an impressive 4-2 record and 1.81 earned run average in the final two months of the regular season and was effective again in Game 3, albeit in a loss.\nIn the top of the first, Spahn recorded two quick outs. Hank Bauer, who would be the Series' top hitter with a .323 batting average, four home runs and eight RBI, stepped to the plate and slammed his fourth homer into the left-field bleachers for an early 1–0 lead. The Braves answered with a run in the bottom of the inning on a Red Schoendienst single, a sacrifice bunt by Johnny Logan, and a run-scoring single to left by Hank Aaron. Spahn settled in and retired the Yankees without a hit in the second.\nAlso pitching on two days' rest, Ford quickly withered in the bottom of the second. After striking out Del Crandall, Wes Covington singled to center on a trap by center fielder Mickey Mantle. Andy Pafko singled to right, advancing Covington to third. Spahn singled to right-center, scoring Covington for a 2–1 lead. An exhausted Ford walked Schoendienst, loading the bases, and Casey Stengel had seen enough, motioning to the bullpen for reliever Art Ditmar. Ditmar faced one batter, Logan, who flied out to Elston Howard, who in turn threw home with a perfect throw to Yogi Berra, doubling up Pafko trying to score on a sac-fly. The RBI single by Spahn would be the last run scored against Ford in the World Series for innings.\nMilwaukee held on to the lead until the top of the sixth inning when the Yankees tied the score on a defensive replacement miscue. Bill Bruton had entered the game to play center for Pafko. After Mantle singled just over the reach of shortstop Logan's glove, Howard followed with single to center. Bruton fumbled the ball, allowing Mantle to reach third on the error. Berra hit a sacrifice fly to center, Mantle scoring after the catch, to tie the game at two.\nSpahn was still on the mound for the Braves going into the 10th, despite throwing 290 innings in the regular season and another 28 in the post-season to that point. Gil McDougald, who was having a fine series himself, led off by hitting a Spahn fastball over the left-field fence. Bauer almost went back-to-back but Bruton made the catch in deep center. Mantle grounded to second for the second out but Howard and Berra followed with singles, setting up runners on first and third. Haney called on Don McMahon to replace Spahn. Moose Skowron struck a single to right, scoring Howard for a two-run lead. Pitcher Ryne Duren stayed in the game to hit but struck out to end the inning.\nThe Braves made some noise in the bottom of the 10th, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Yankee lead. Logan, on first after a walk and with two outs, went to second on defensive indifference (not a stolen base). The ever-dependable Aaron singled to left, scoring Logan, and the Braves were within one run of tying the game. Joe Adcock then singled, sending Aaron to third. Bob Turley came in to relieve Duren and Felix Mantilla pinch-ran for Adcock. With two on and two outs, Frank Torre, pinch-hitting for Del Crandall, lined out to McDougald at the very edge of the outfield grass to end the game and force Game 7.\nGame 7.\nFor the fourth straight year, the World Series went the distance. Yankee manager Casey Stengel again chose Don Larsen to start Game 7. Larsen had only lasted innings starting Game 7 in the 1957 World Series and once again lasted innings in 1958. Braves right-hander Lew Burdette, who pitched a complete game win in Game 2 but gave up six runs in a Game 5 loss, started for the third time in the series.\nThe Yankees failed to score in the first while the Braves tallied a single run on some lack of control by Larsen. Red Schoendienst led off with a single to left, Bill Bruton walked and Frank Torre sacrificed up both runners, Jerry Lumpe to Gil McDougald, who was covering first base. Hank Aaron walked loading the bases; things looking pretty good for the Braves thus far. Wes Covington grounded out to first but Schoendienst scored on the play. Eddie Mathews took an intentional pass, but Del Crandall struck out to end the threat.\nThe Yankees struck back. Cleanup hitter Yogi Berra led off with a walk. Slow-footed but hustling Elston Howard laid down a sacrifice and, incredibly, was called safe on a poorly tossed throw by Torre to pitcher Burdette. Jerry Lumpe grounded again to Torre, who again threw too high to Burdette for another error, loading the bases. The left-handed hitting Torre got the start in place of veteran right-hander Joe Adcock. The next batter, Bill Skowron, forced Lumpe at second, scoring Berra and moving Howard to third. Tony Kubek lifted a sacrifice fly to left, scoring Howard giving the Yankees a 2–1 lead, which held up until the sixth.\nTwo singles in the bottom of the third brought Stengel out to replace Larsen with a short-rested Bob Turley. The stocky right-hander escaped a bases-loaded situation and pitched superb ball the rest of the way. As in Game 6, the score was tied at two after six innings, when Del Crandall homered into the left-field stands with two outs, giving Braves fans a reason to cheer and promise of another title.\nBut that hope would fade as the Yankees came to bat in the top of the eighth inning. With tiring Lew Burdette looking for another complete-game victory, they started an improbable two-out rally. After a McDougald fly out and Mickey Mantle looking at a called third strike, Berra doubled off the wall in the right-field corner. Howard followed with a run-scoring bouncer to center field. Andy Carey singled off Eddie Mathews' glove before Bill Skowron then delivered the back-breaker, a three-run homer to left-center field, to cap a storybook comeback. Other than a lead-off walk to Eddie Mathews and a 2-out pinch-hit single by Joe Adcock in the ninth, Milwaukee went quietly to sleep, and the Yankees had their 18th World Championship.\nHank Bauer (a nine-Series veteran) led with most runs scored (six), most hits (ten), most home runs (four) and most runs batted in (eight). He also paced the victors with a .323 average. Despite less-than-stellar stats in his first four Classics (7-for-57 with a .123 avg.), he combined for 18 hits, six home runs, 14 RBI and a .290 average against the Braves in 1957 and 1958. Even so, Turley became the first relief pitcher to be named World Series MVP, going 2–1 with a save. As of 2023 this would be the final of 4 consecutive World Series to go the maximum 7 games (1955-58).\nComposite line score.\n1958 World Series (4–3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Milwaukee Braves (N.L.)"

        "title": "1920 World Series",
        "text": "The 1920 World Series was the championship series for Major League Baseball's 1920 season. The series was a best-of-nine format played between the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians and the National League (NL) champion Brooklyn Robins, with the Indians defeating the Robins five games to two. The only World Series triple play, the first World Series grand slam, and the first World Series home run by a pitcher all occurred in Game 5 of this series. This was also the first World Series and first Big Four championship series to feature two brothers on opposing teams, with Doc Johnston playing for Cleveland and Jimmy Johnston playing for Brooklyn.\nThe Indians won the series in memory of their former shortstop Ray Chapman, who had been killed earlier in the season when struck in the head by a pitched ball. \nIn Game 5, Cleveland second basemen Bill Wambsganss turned an unassisted triple play. He caught a line drive off the bat of Clarence Mitchell, stepped on second base to put out Pete Kilduff, and tagged Otto Miller coming from first base. It was the second of 15 (as of 2022) unassisted triple plays in major-league baseball history, and it remains the only one in postseason play. Mitchell made history again in the eighth inning by hitting into a double play, accounting for five outs in two straight at-bats.\nThe fifth game also saw the first grand slam in World Series history (hit by Cleveland's Elmer Smith) and the first Series home run by a pitcher (Cleveland's Jim Bagby, Sr.). And in that same game, Brooklyn outhit Cleveland but lost 8–1.\nCleveland had won the American League pennant in a close race with the Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees. The Sox's participation in the Black Sox Scandal the previous year had caught up to them late in the season, and their star players were suspended with three games left in the season, when they were in a virtual tie with the Indians. The Yankees, with their recently acquired star Babe Ruth, were almost ready to start their eventual World Series dynasty. \nThis was the second of three consecutive World Series to use a best-of-nine format, instead of the usual best-of-seven. To reduce travel during the Series, the 2-3-2-2 format that was used in 1919 was changed to 3-4-2. Notably, all seven games of the 1920 World Series were won by the team who scored first. In fact, Game 4 was the only game in which the losing team scored a run before the winning team had scored \"all\" of its runs. The lead never changed hands in any game.\nThis would be the last World Series until to feature two franchises that had not previously won a championship.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nGame 1 took a mere 1 hour, 41 minutes. Steve O'Neill supplied RBI doubles in the second and fourth innings in support of Stan Coveleski, who won it for the visiting Indians with a five-hitter.\nGame 2.\nA first-inning run on a Jimmy Johnston single and Zack Wheat double would be all Dodger pitcher Burleigh Grimes would require in a complete-game shutout.\nGame 3.\nBrooklyn scored twice in the first on hits by Zack Wheat and Hi Myers that chased Cleveland starter Ray Caldwell from the game. The only run winning pitcher Sherry Smith gave up in a three-hitter came when Tris Speaker came all the way around on a double that was misplayed in left field.\nGame 4.\nBrooklyn starter Leon Cadore didn't make it past the first inning. His relievers didn't fare much better, Al Mamaux being removed in the third and Rube Marquard greeted by a George Burns two-run double. Stan Coveleski cruised with a five-hitter for his second win of the Series.\nGame 5.\nThe \"Cleveland Times\" ran the following article on Monday, October 11, 1920, recounting Game 5 and Wambsganss' triple play:\nWamby Makes Unassisted Triple Play\nGame 6.\nEven faster than Game 1, this one was done in just 94 minutes. Duster Mails twirled a three-hit shutout, and the lone run came in the sixth on a Tris Speaker two-out single, followed by a George Burns double.\nGame 7.\nThe Robins didn't score in the last two games. Their pitcher, Burleigh Grimes, committed an error on a Cleveland double steal that resulted in the game's first run. Stan Coveleski needed no more, but got one in the fifth from a Tris Speaker run-scoring triple and another in the seventh on Charlie Jamieson's RBI double. Spitball pitcher Coveleski won for the third time and the Indians celebrated before their home fans.\nComposite line score.\n1920 World Series (5–2): Cleveland Indians (A.L.) over Brooklyn Robins (N.L.)"

        "title": "1921 World Series",
        "text": "The 1921 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1921 season. The 18th edition of the World Series, it matched the National League champion New York Giants and the American League champion New York Yankees.\nThe Series matched two distinct teams in strategy with the Giants, dedicated practitioners of the dead-ball era's \"inside game\" and the Yankees, who relied on the \"power game\" exemplified by Babe Ruth, who was coming off of what was arguably his best year ever statistically. This was the first World Series appearance by the Yankees, who have gone on to play in the Series a record 40 times. The 1921 Series was a closely contested matchup that ended on a double play featuring a baserunning miscue. It was also the last of four World Series to use the best-of-nine format, which had been used in the 1903, 1919, and the 1920 editions. The following year, the World Series permanently switched to a best-of-seven game format where it has remained ever since. It was also the first World Series to be broadcast over radio.\nBackground.\nThe Series was the last of the experimental best-five-of-nine series, which the Giants won five games to three. All eight games were played at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan, New York, each team alternating as the nominal \"home team\" since the Yankees had subleased the stadium from the Giants for the 1913 through 1922 seasons, so that it was the home park for both teams during the regular season in those ten years. This marked the first time in World Series history that the series occurred at a single site. It happened again the following year in the same place with the same two teams, in 1944 at St. Louis' Sportsman's Park between the Cardinals and the Browns, and then again in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the first-ever neutral-site Series played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Tampa Bay Rays. For New Yorkers, this was the first subway Series in World Series history. It was also the first World Series to be broadcast on radio, with Grantland Rice covering the games live through Pittsburgh's KDKA. It was rebroadcast on WBZ in Massachusetts. Announcer Tommy Cowan also recreated the games over Westinghouse-owned WJZ in Newark as he listened to phoned-in reports from the stadium.\nBecause of an infected arm and a bad knee (which he wrenched in Game 5), Babe Ruth did not start the final three games, appearing only as a pinch-hitter in the final inning of Game 8. Following the Series, Ruth and Bob Meusel did some postseason barnstorming, against the rules for Series participants at that time. Both were suspended for a number of games at the start of the 1922 season. Ruth filed a personal appeal with Commissioner Landis, who upheld their suspensions but agreed to rescind the rule effective the end of that season.\nThen New York Governor Nathan L. Miller, described as \"a big baseball fan\" by \"The New York Times\", made plans to attend games as a guest of the Commissioner of Baseball. The Series drew fans to New York City from across the continent, from as far west as California and Mexico to as far south as Cuba. Hotels were booked up, and both the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads made plans to add cars and run their trains in sections if necessary to handle the extra traffic expected. Harry L. Davis, then the Governor of Ohio, was expected to attend the games as were several other VIPs of the time.\nThis was the fourth World Series for Giants' assistant coach \"Eee-yah!\" Hughie Jennings, who had managed young Ty Cobb and the pennant-winning but Series-losing 1907, 1908 &amp; 1909 Detroit Tigers and had been brought in as an assistant coach for the Giants by John McGraw the previous October after Jennings had resigned from the Tigers. The two were teammates on the old Baltimore Orioles in earlier seasons.\nSeveral players on both teams didn't start the 1921 season with either the Giants or the Yankees, and several others moved to other teams during the regular season earlier that year. For the Giants, Johnny Rawlings, Irish Meusel, Casey Stengel and Red Causey started the season as Philadelphia Phillies, who finished last in the National League that year. Outfielder Bill Cunningham had played for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, nor did Cozy Dolan or Red Shea start the season with the Giants, while the Yankees acquired outfielder Elmer Miller and pitcher Tom Rogers during the season. Nonparticipants from either team in the Series included Curt Walker, Lee King, Johnny Monroe, Rube Benton, Goldie Rapp, Ping Bodie, Tom Sheehan and Tom Connelly.\nThis was the first of three consecutive matchups between the Yankees and Giants (1921–1923) and marked the only time (as of 2023) that three straight World Series featured the same two clubs. Brothers Bob and Irish Meusel played against each other in each of those three series, making them the first set of brothers to play against each other on opposing teams in a World Series or any Big Four championship series.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nMays pitched a complete game 5-hit shutout, Frankie Frisch getting 4 of those hits off of Mays in a losing cause for the Giants. This was the first World Series game victory for the Yankees.\nGame 2.\nPitching Ruth carefully, the Giants walked the Babe three times; but after the third walk he stole second and then third base, much to the delight of Yankee fans. But when he slid into third, he scraped his elbow severely and the site became infected. Hoyt held the Giants to two hits, the Yankees jumping to a 2-0 lead in the series.\nGame 3.\nAfter getting outscored 6–0 in the first two games of this series and falling behind 4–0 in the top of the third, the Giants tied it with four runs of their own in the bottom half. Later on, an 8-run 7th inning highlighted by Ross Youngs' bases loaded triple turned the tide as the Giants got their first win of this series. Ruth was taken out in the eighth after again scraping his elbow sliding into a base. The Yankees announced after the game that the elbow would have to be lanced and that he would not return for the rest of the Series.\nGame 4.\nRuth suited up, but stayed on the bench during batting practice. When the game began, however, to everyone's surprise, he popped out of the dugout and jogged to his outfield position. The crowd roared. He kept touching his bandaged arm throughout the game. Despite the injury, he got two hits including a ninth-inning homer, his first World Series home run as well as the first World Series home run in Yankees franchise history. But the Giants won the game and tied the series at 2–2.\nGame 5.\nRuth's arm was still bandaged, but he played again. In the fourth, with the score tied 1–1, he shocked everyone by bunting and beating it out. His teammate Meusel then doubled, scoring Ruth all the way from first base for the go-ahead run in a 3–1 Yankee win.\nGame 6.\nThe Giants battled back from 3–0 and 5–3 deficits to take Game 6.\nGame 7.\nPhil Douglas scattered eight hits and held the Yankees to one run, the Giants winning 2-1 on Frank Snyder's RBI double in the seventh inning.\nGame 8.\nFacing elimination, Yankee manager Miller Huggins sent Ruth out to pinch-hit in the bottom of the ninth. The Babe, nursing both elbow and knee injuries, had sat out this game and missed all of Games 6 and 7. The bases were empty and the Yankees still trailed by the lone run of the game scored by the Giants in the top of the first. A HR would tie the game, and a hit or a walk would give the Yankees a chance. But Ruth grounded out, and shortly afterwards Frank Baker hit into a double play after a walk by Aaron Ward who was thrown out at third base for the final out of the Series, giving the Giants their first world championship since Christy Mathewson's record three complete shutouts in 1905.\nComposite line score.\n1921 World Series (5–3): New York Giants (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1922 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1922 season. The 19th edition of the World Series, it matched the National League champion New York Giants against the American League champion New York Yankees. The Giants beat the Yankees in five games (four games to zero, with one tie) in the first Series with a permanent best-of-seven format. By now, the term \"World Series\" was being used frequently, as opposed to \"World's Series\". As with the 1921 World Series, every game was played at the Polo Grounds because it housed both teams, with the home team alternating; it was also the Yankees' final series to be played at the Polo Grounds as a home team, as they would move into the then-under construction Yankee Stadium for the following season, which ended in them winning the rematch against the Giants.\nThe Giants held Babe Ruth in check (he batted only .118 with just one RBI) and scored just enough runs to win each of the games outside the controversial Game 2 tie. That game was called on account of darkness, but many thought there was sufficient light to have played some more innings (the sun was still in the sky), and there were some suspicions that one or both teams might have \"allowed\" the tie to happen to increase the overall gate receipts. Commissioner Landis was among those who was dissatisfied with the result. One story is that Landis asked Umpire Hildebrand, \"Why the Sam Hill did you call the game?\" The umpire answered, \"There was a temporary haze on the field.\" The game decision was in the hands of the umpires, but the Commissioner's Office controlled the gate receipts. Landis ordered the money, more than $120,000, turned over to World War I charities, thus nullifying any impropriety. The tied game would turn out to be the third (and final) tied game in the history of the World Series. The other two tied games occurred in and . No ties are possible under later rules, which allow for suspension of a tied game and resumption of it at a later date, as with Game 5 of the 2008 World Series.\nAs of 2023, this is the last time the Giants have won the World Series at home, as their next five championships were all clinched on the road. This would prove to be Giants' manager John McGraw's third and final World Series win.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe game and Series remained scoreless until the sixth inning. Whitey Witt tripled off of Art Nehf, then was cut down at home trying to score on a fielder's choice, but a Babe Ruth hit got the run home. The Yankees added another run next inning on Aaron Ward's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. A three-run Giant rally in the eighth knocked out Yankee starter Bullet Joe Bush, who allowed four straight leadoff singles, the last of which to Irish Meusel scoring two. and the winning run coming off reliever Waite Hoyt on a Ross Youngs sacrifice fly.\nGame 2.\nThis was the controversial tie (see above). Pitchers Bob Shawkey and Jesse Barnes went all 10 innings. The Giants scored all three runs in the first on Irish Meusel's three-run home run after two singles. The Yankees scored a run in the first on Wally Pipp's RBI single after Joe Dugan reached second on an error and another run in the fourth on Aaron Ward's home run. The Yankees had tied the game in the eighth on doubles by Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel, but that is the way the game ended.\nGame 3.\nKnuckleballer Jack Scott kept the Yankees off the board. In the bottom of the third with runners on second and third, Frankie Frisch's sacrifice fly and Irish Meusel's RBI single scored a run each for the Giants, who added an insurance run in the seventh on Frankie Frisch's RBI single. The game took just 1 hour, 48 minutes.\nGame 4.\nThis contest moved along even faster than Game 3. It was over in a snappy 1:41, with Giants pitcher Hugh McQuillan going the distance for a 4-3 win. The Yankees scored two runs in the first on back-to-back singles by Wally Pipp and Bob Meusel, but in the fifth after a leadoff single and double, Dave Bancroft's two-run single tied the game. After a single and groundout, Irish Meusel's groundout and Ross Youngs's RBI single scored a run each. Aaron Ward's home run in the seventh cut the Giants' lead to one, but the Yankees did not score after that.\nGame 5.\nArt Nehf's five-hit pitching combined with a three-run eighth inning won the Series for the Giants. The Yankees scored a run in the first when Joe Dugan singled with one out, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Wally Pipp's RBI single, but in the bottom of the second with runners on second and third, Bill Cunningham's two-run single gave the Giants the lead. The Yankees tied the game in the fifth on Bullet Joe Bush's RBI single after a walk and single, then took the lead on Everett Scott's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. The decisive rally began with a Heinie Groh single and Frankie Frisch double. After an intentional walk to Ross Youngs, a two-run single by High Pockets Kelly put the Giants on top. The next batter, Lee King, inserted in the outfield that inning for defensive purposes, delivered an RBI single to make it 5-3, and that's how it ended.\nThis was the second of three consecutive matchups between the Yankees and Giants (1921–1923) marked the only time (as of 2023), that three straight World Series featured the same two clubs. Brothers Bob and Irish Meusel played against each other in each of those three series, making them the first set of brothers to play against each other on opposing teams in a World Series or any Big Four championship series.\nThe Giants became the second NL team to win back-to-back World Series, following the Chicago Cubs in 1907–08, and remained the last until the 1975–76 Cincinnati Reds. This also remains the last World Series to be won by the Giants at home, as their championships of 1933 and 1954 (for New York) and 2010, 2012 and 2014 (for San Francisco) were all clinched as the visiting team.\nComposite line score.\n1922 World Series (4–0–1): New York Giants (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)"

        "title": "1923 World Series",
        "text": "The 1923 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1923 season. The 20th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees against the National League champion New York Giants. The Yankees beat the Giants in six games. This would be the first of the Yankees' 27 World Series championships (as of ). The series was not played in a 2–3–2 format: as with the previous two Series (where both clubs had shared the Polo Grounds) the home field alternated each game, though this time it involved switching ballparks, as the first Yankee Stadium had opened this season.\nBackground.\nThe Yankees opened their new stadium in April on a home run by Babe Ruth, setting the tone for the season and this Series, in which Ruth hit three home runs along with drawing eight walks. In Game 2, second baseman, Aaron Ward hit a home run. The Giants' one bright spot was \"Old Casey\" Stengel, who hit game-winning homers in each of the two Giants' victories. In typically eccentric Stengel fashion, one of them was inside-the-park at the cavernous Yankee Stadium, and his shoe came loose during his run around the bases. Stengel was traded after the season, leading him to quip later in life, \"It's a good thing I didn't hit \"three\" homers in \"three\" games, or McGraw would have traded me to the Three-I League!\". A quarter century later, Stengel would take on the role of Yankees manager, and would guide the Bronx Bombers through one of their most successful eras.\nIn Game 6, the Yankees overcame a 4–1 deficit by staging a five-run rally in the eighth inning to clinch the series.\nThe three consecutive matchups between the Yankees and Giants (1921–1923) marked the only time (as of 2020), that three straight World Series featured the same two clubs. Brothers Bob and Irish Meusel played against each other in each of those three series, making them the first set of brothers to play against each other on opposing teams in a World Series or any Big Four championship series.\nThanks to the large seating capacity of the new Yankee Stadium, coupled with expansion of the Polo Grounds the same year, the 1923 Series was the first to eclipse 300,000 in total attendance (301,430), averaging over 50,000 per game (50,238), with gate receipts over $1 million ($1,063,815.00).\nThis was the third time that a team had inaugurated a new stadium with a World Series win, and would be the last until the St. Louis Cardinals victory in their new ballpark in , and the New York Yankees again won the World Series in in their new Yankee Stadium.\nBabe Ruth had a great series, his first great one as a Yankee, batting .368 and hitting three home runs in the series.\nNeither Lou Gehrig, Bill Terry nor Hack Wilson played in the Series. These future Hall of Famers were each in their first season and had played no more than thirteen games in the regular season. Gehrig had been called up from Hartford to play for the Yankees that year. In that time, however, a team had to have the permission of both the commissioner and the opposing team's manager to make a roster change so late in the season eligible for postseason play. The Yankees gained the permission of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis who then told them to get John McGraw's permission. McGraw and the Yankees had a long history of disdain after both teams had shared a stadium and the Giants had won both the 1921 and 1922 World Series from New York. Therefore, he declined permission and Gehrig would not be allowed to participate in the series which otherwise would have been his first World Series. As noted baseball historian John Thorn said, \"As if the Yankees needed any more reason to hate John McGraw.\"\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nA ninth-inning inside-the-park homer by Casey Stengel beat the Yankees on their home field. Babe Ruth scored in the first inning on a Bob Meusel double. Yankee center fielder Whitey Witt's two-run single in the next inning made it 3-0. The Giants fought back with a four-run third, knocking out Yankee starter Waite Hoyt from the game. It was tied at 4-4 in the ninth inning until Casey came to bat, legging out a long drive to the left-center gap.\nGame 2.\nAfter trading home runs by Aaron Ward and Irish Meusel, a pair of Babe Ruth blasts in the fourth and fifth innings turned out to be the difference.\nGame 3.\nA scoreless pitching duel lasted until the seventh inning, when Casey Stengel struck again, this time with a homer that left the park. It gave Art Nehf the win over Sad Sam Jones, despite the Giants getting just four hits.\nGame 4.\nA six-run second inning chased Giant starter Jack Scott, the first four Yankee batters of that inning reaching safely. Bob Meusel added a two-run triple. A ninth-inning leadoff inside-the-park homer by Ross Youngs gave the home team a flicker of hope, but Herb Pennock mopped up in relief.\nGame 5.\nIt was over in a hurry. Bob Meusel's two-run triple and a Wally Pipp sacrifice fly made it 3-0. Then the Yankees got four more in the second, Joe Dugan's three-run inside-the-park homer the big blow. Bullet Joe Bush surrendered just three hits to the Giants, who now faced elimination.\nGame 6.\nRight off the bat, the Yankees struck with a Babe Ruth two-out homer in the first. But then the Giants and their Polo Grounds crowd came to life. Three singles in the first tied the score. Center fielder Bill Cunningham knocked in a go-ahead run in the fourth, followed by catcher Frank Snyder's homer in the fifth inning. Down 4-1, the Yankees took advantage of two singles followed by 3 consecutive walks. Ruth struck out with the score 4-3, and Bob Meusel hit a clutch two-out single scoring two runs, and a third scoring on an error, making it 6-4 Yankees. Sad Sam Jones would get the 6 out save to win the Yankees their first championship.\nComposite line score.\n1923 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1924 World Series was the championship series of the 1924 Major League Baseball season. A best-of-seven playoff, the series was played between the American League (AL) pennant winner Washington Senators and the National League (NL) pennant winner New York Giants. The Senators defeated the Giants in seven games to win their first championship in club history. The Giants became the first team to play in four consecutive World Series, winning in 1921–1922 and losing in 1923–1924. Their long-time manager, John McGraw, made his ninth and final World Series appearance in 1924. The contest concluded with the second World Series-deciding game which ran to extra innings (the first had occurred in 1912). In 1961, the Senators relocated to Minnesota and were rebranded as the Twins, subsequently winning the World Series in 1987 and in 1991.\nWalter Johnson, after pitching his first 20-victory season (23) since 1919, was making his first World Series appearance, at the age of 36, while nearing the end of his career with the Senators. He lost his two starts, but the Senators battled back to force a Game 7, giving Johnson a chance to redeem himself when he came on in relief in that game. Johnson held on to get the win and give Washington its first championship. The seventh game is widely considered to be one of the most dramatic games in Series history.\nJohnson struck out 12 Giants batters in Game 1 in a losing cause. Although that total matched Ed Walsh's number in the 1906 World Series, it came in 12 innings. Johnson struck out only nine in the first nine innings.\nIn Game 7, with the Senators behind 3–1 in the eighth, Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three. Walter Johnson then came in to pitch the ninth, and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. With the score still 3–3, Washington came up in the 12th. With one out, and runners on first and second, Earl McNeely hit another grounder at Lindstrom, and again the ball took a bad hop, scoring Muddy Ruel with the Series-winning run.\nThis was the first World Series to use the 2–3–2 home game pattern, which would be adapted as the permanent format beginning the following year.\nThis was the Senators' only World Series championship victory during the franchise's time in Washington. As the Minnesota Twins, the team won the World Series in 1987 and . This would be the last World Series win for a Washington based team until the Washington Nationals, who were originally the Montreal Expos, won the World Series in , 95 years after the Senators' only triumph.\nIn 2020, ESPN named it the third greatest World Series of all-time.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Senators tied it at 2–2 with a run in the bottom of the ninth. The Giants scored two in the top of the 12th off the Big Train; Washington fought back for a run in the bottom of the inning, but left the tying run on third.\nGame 2.\nWashington fought back early in the game, scoring 3 runs in 5 innings. But the Giants would quickly fight back in the final three frames to tie the game as it went to the bottom of the ninth. With Joe Judge representing the potential winning run and 1 out, Roger Peckinpaugh hit a double to win the game and tie the series.\nGame 3.\nWashington threatened in the ninth. Ossie Bluege, the only man reliever Claude Jonnard faced, drew a bases-loaded walk to make it 6-4. Mule Watson then came in to nail down the last two outs. Rosy Ryan's fourth-inning home run is to date the only World Series home run by a relief pitcher.\nGame 4.\nGoose Goslin had a big game for the Senators, with three singles and a home run to go 4-for-4 and drive in four runs.\nGame 5.\nJohnson again pitched a complete game but the Giants recorded 13 hits off him, taking a 3–2 lead in the Series. Bentley broke a 1–1 tie in the fifth with a two-run home run, the second homer by a New York pitcher in the Series after Rosy Ryan's in Game 3.\nGame 6.\nBoth Washington runs scored on a single in the fifth inning by manager Bucky Harris. Tom Zachary won his second game of the series, deadlocking the series at three games each.\nGame 7.\nThe unheralded Curly Ogden was given the Game 7 start for Washington – it was his only World Series appearance. He struck out a batter and walked one, and then was pulled for George Mogridge. It was later revealed that manager Bucky Harris started righthander Ogden so that the Giants would be locked into their \"righthanded\" lineup, before he switched to the lefthander Mogridge.\nWith the Senators trailing 3–1 in the eighth inning with bases loaded and two outs, Bucky Harris hit a \"bad hop\" ground ball to third which Fred Lindstrom failed to catch (no error was charged). As a result, two runs scored for a 3–3 tie. In the ninth inning, Walter Johnson would step up as pitcher and pitch four scoreless innings.\nIn the bottom of the 12th inning, Giants catcher Hank Gowdy stepped on his own discarded mask while trying to catch a Muddy Ruel foul pop-up, and dropped the ball for an error. Given a second chance in the at-bat, Ruel doubled. Johnson reached first on another error, and with Ruel on second and Johnson on first, Earl McNeely hit a \"bad hop\" ground ball to Lindstrom that was almost identical to Harris' eighth inning hit. Lindstrom again failed to catch the ball as it bounced over him into left field, and Ruel scored the series-winning run.\nThe game holds the record as the longest Game 7 (by innings) in MLB postseason history. It was also the first World Series Game 7 to be decided in extra innings (although the series ended with a ten-inning Game 8), and the last until .\nIn 2014, on the Series' 90th anniversary, the Library of Congress acquired a newsreel of highlight footage from Game 7, including McNeely's Series-winning base hit. CNN subsequently released this footage on its website.\nThe next time a Washington team won the World Series would come 95 years later in , when the Washington Nationals did so against the Houston Astros.\nComposite line score.\n1924 World Series (4–3): Washington Senators (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1925 World Series was the championship series of the 1925 Major League Baseball season. A best-of-seven playoff, it was played between the National League (NL) pennant winner Pittsburgh Pirates and the Washington Senators. The Pirates defeated the Senators four games to three to win the series.\nIn a reversal of fortune on all counts from the previous 1924 World Series, when Washington's Walter Johnson had come back from two losses to win the seventh and deciding game, Johnson dominated in Games 1 and 4, but lost Game 7.\nThe Senators built up a 3–1 Series lead. After Pittsburgh won the next two games, Johnson again took the mound for Game 7, and carried a 6–4 lead into the bottom of the seventh inning. But errors by shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh in both the seventh and eighth innings led to four unearned runs, and the Pirates become the first team in a best-of-seven Series to overcome a 3–1 Series deficit to win the championship. Peckinpaugh, the Senators' regular shortstop and the 1925 American League Most Valuable Player, had a tough Series in the field, committing a record eight errors.\nPlaying conditions were of no help. The 1925 Series was postponed twice due to poor weather, and Game 7 was played in what soon became a steady downpour, described as \"probably the worst conditions ever for a World Series game.\" Senators outfielder Goose Goslin reported that the fog prevented him from clearly seeing the infield during the last three innings of the game, and claimed that the Series-winning hit was actually a foul ball. In the next day's \"The New York Times\", James Harrison wrote \"In a grave of mud was buried Walter Johnson's ambition to join the select panel of pitchers who have won three victories in one World Series. With mud shackling his ankles and water running down his neck, the grand old man of baseball succumbed to weariness, a sore leg, wretched support and the most miserable weather conditions that ever confronted a pitcher.\"\nTwice in Game 7 the visiting Senators held leads of at least three runs over the Pirates but failed to hold them. In fact, after the top of the first inning, Washington led 4–0. Nevertheless, Pittsburgh eventually won the game, scoring three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to turn a 6–7 deficit into a 9–7 lead. To date, the four-run deficit is the largest ever overcome in the seventh game of the World Series.\nA memorable play occurred during the eighth inning of Game 3. The Senators' Sam Rice ran after an Earl Smith line drive hit into right center field. Rice made a diving \"catch\" into the temporary stands, but did not emerge with the ball for approximately 15 seconds. The Pirates contested the play, saying a fan probably stuffed the ball into Rice's glove. The call stood and Rice parried questions about the incident for the rest of his life—never explicitly saying whether he had or had not really made the catch. His typical answer (including to Commissioner Landis, who said it was a good answer) was always \"The umpire said I caught it.\" Rice left a sealed letter at the Hall of Fame to be opened after his death. In it, he had written: \"At no time did I lose possession of the ball.\"\nWriter Lamont Buchanan wrote, \"In 1925, the Senators hopped the Big Train once too often... earning Bucky [Harris] the criticism of many fans and American League head [Ban] Johnson who dispatched an irate wire to the Senators manager.\" In his telegram, Ban Johnson accused the manager of failing to relieve Walter Johnson \"for sentimental reasons.\" Despite the second-guessing, Harris always said, 'If I had it to do over again, I'd still pitch Johnson.'\" \nThis was Walter Johnson's second and final World Series appearance. By the time the original Washington Senators next reached the Fall Classic in 1933 – their last before they became the Minnesota Twins, and the city's last until the Nationals – Johnson had retired.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThis game remains to date the last road World Series game the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins franchise has won. They have lost their last 14 since. Walter Johnson pitched a complete game and allowed only five hits and struck out ten. The Senators got on the board in the second on Joe Harris's home run off of Lee Meadows. In the fifth, they loaded the bases on three singles with no outs, but after Meadows struck out the next two batters, a two-run single by Sam Rice made it 3–0 Senators. Pie Traynor's leadoff home run in the bottom half gave the Pirates their only run in the game. The Senators added another run in the ninth off of Johnny Morrison when Goose Goslin hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Ossie Bluege's single.\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, Joe Judge's second inning home run off of Vic Aldridge gave the Senators a 1–0 lead, but the Pirates tied the game in the fourth on Glenn Wright's home run in the fourth off of Stan Coveleski. In the eighth, Kiki Cuyler's two-run home run in the eighth following a Roger Peckinpaugh error that let Eddie Moore reached first put the Pirates up 3–1. In the ninth, the Senators loaded the bases with no outs on two walks and a single, but scored only once on Bobby Veach's sacrifice fly as Aldridge retired the next two batters and the Pirates tied the series heading to Washington.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, the Pirates struck first in the second when Pie Traynor hit a leadoff triple off of Alex Ferguson and scored on Glenn Wright's sacrifice fly, but the Senators tied the game in the third off of Ray Kremer when Sam Rice hit a leadoff single and scored on Joe Judge's double. The Pirates regained the lead in the fourth when Kiki Cuyler hit a leadoff single and scored on Clyde Barnhart's double. They added to their lead in the sixth on Kremer's RBI single with two on, but Goose Goslin's home run in the bottom half cut their lead back to one. Next inning, the Senators loaded the bases on a walk and two singles with one out before Judge's sacrifice fly tied the game, then an RBI single by Joe Harris put them up 4–3. A key play occurred in the eighth inning when Earl Smith's line drive into right-center field was caught by Sam Rice who fell into the temporary stands (see overview above). Firpo Marberry pitched two shutout innings to close the game.\nGame 4.\nThis was Johnson's only post-season shutout. A three-run home run by Goose Goslin followed by a solo home run by Joe Harris off of Emil Yde, who pitched just innings, in the third inning put the Senators up 3–1 in the series. Yde became the first pitcher in the history of the World Series to surrender back-to-back home runs.\nGame 5.\nThe Pirates loaded the bases in the first, but failed to score. In the bottom half, Sam Rice hit a leadoff single and scored on Goose Goslin's double. In the third, after two walks, Clyde Barnhart's RBI single tied the game, then Pie Traynor's sacrifice fly put the Pirates up 2–1. Joe Harris's home run in the fourth tied the game. After a walk and single, back-to-back RBI singles by Kiki Cuyler and Clyde Barnhart in the seventh put the Pirates up 4–2 and knock Stan Coveleski out of the game. The Senators cut the lead to 4–3 in the bottom half when Nemo Leibold hit a leadoff double and scored on Sam Rice's single, but the Pirates got the run back in the eighth when Glenn Wright hit a leadoff double off of Tom Zachary and scored on Stuffy McInnis's single. They added another run in the ninth on Wright's RBI single off of Firpo Marberry with the run charged to Zachary. Vic Aldridge retired the Senators in order in the bottom half as the Pirates' 6–3 win forced a Game 6 in Pittsburgh.\nGame 6.\nThe Senators struck first on Goose Goslin's home run in the first, then added another run in the second on Roger Peckinpaugh's RBI double, but Pirates' Ray Kremer would shut them out afterward. In the third, with runners on second and third, Clyde Barnhart's groundout and Pie Traynor's single scored a run each to tie the game. Eddie Moore's fifth inning home run put the Pirates up 3–2. Their lead held, forcing a Game 7.\nGame 7.\nThe Senators loaded the bases in the first on a single and two walks with one out. A walk to Joe Judge and RBI single by Ossie Bluege put them up 2–0 and knock starter Vic Aldridge out of the game. Johnny Morrison came in relief, but a catcher interference call and error allowed two more runs to score. In the third, a leadoff single by Morrison, then RBI hits by Eddie Moore, Max Carey and Clyde Barnhart cut the Senators' lead to 4–3. In the fourth, Joe Harris's two-run double extended Washington's lead to 6–3. Back-to-back doubles by Carey and Kiki Cuyler in the fifth cut the lead to 6–4, then in the seventh, Moore reached first on an error before Carey's RBI double and Traynor's RBI triple tied the game. Roger Peckinpaugh's home run in the eighth off of Ray Kremer put the Senators back atop 7–6, but in the bottom half, back-to-back two-out doubles by Earl Smith and Carson Bigbee tied the game. A walk and fielder's choice loaded the bases before Cuyler's two-run double put the Pirates atop 9–7. Red Oldham retired the Senators in order in the ninth to end the series. The Pirates hit Walter Johnson hard for 15 hits in a 9–7 comeback win in rainy, wet and muddy conditions. The Pirates were the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in a seven-game series.\nComposite line score.\n1925 World Series (4–3): Pittsburgh Pirates (N.L.) defeat Washington Senators (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1926 World Series was the championship series of the 1926 Major League Baseball season. The 23rd edition of the Series, it pitted the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals against the American League champion New York Yankees. The Cardinals defeated the Yankees four games to three in the best-of-seven series, which took place from October 2 to 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium and Sportsman's Park.\nThis was the first World Series appearance (and first National League pennant win) for the Cardinals, and would be the first of 11 World Series championships in Cardinals history. The Yankees were playing in their fourth World Series in six years after winning their first American League pennant in 1921 and their first world championship in 1923. They would play in another 36 World Series (and win 26 of those), as of the end of the 2023 season.\nIn Game 1, Herb Pennock pitched the Yankees to a 2–1 win over the Cards. In Game 2, pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander evened the Series for St. Louis with a 6–2 victory. Knuckleballer Jesse Haines' shutout in Game 3 gave St. Louis a 2–1 Series lead. In the Yankees' 10–5 Game 4 win, Babe Ruth hit three home runs, a World Series record equaled only four times since. According to newspaper reports, Ruth had promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester to hit a home run for him in Game 4. After Ruth's three-homer game, the boy's condition miraculously improved. The newspapers' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it remains one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock again won for the Yankees in Game 5, 3–2.\nCards' player-manager Rogers Hornsby chose Alexander to start Game 6, and used him in relief to close out Game 7. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won the final two games of the series, and thus the world championship. In Game 7, the Yankees, trailing 3–2 in the bottom of the ninth inning and down to their last out, Ruth walked, bringing up Bob Meusel. Ruth, successful in half of his stolen base attempts in his career, took off for second base on the first pitch. Meusel swung and missed, and catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to second baseman Hornsby who tagged Ruth out, ending Game 7 and thereby crowning his Cardinals World Series champions for the first time. The 1926 World Series is the only Series to date which ended with a baserunner being caught stealing.\nThis World Series also started the Cardinals run of dominance in the National League. Between the years 1926 and 1934, St. Louis captured five National League pennants and won three World Series titles.\nSeason summary.\nThe Cardinals won the 1926 National League pennant with 89 wins and 65 losses, two games ahead of the runner-up Cincinnati Reds, after finishing only fourth in 1925 at 77–76. Before 1926 was half over, they traded outfielder Heinie Mueller to the New York Giants for outfielder Billy Southworth. They also claimed future Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander on waivers from the Chicago Cubs. Their starting rotation was led by Flint Rhem with 20 wins and a 3.21 earned run average (ERA), far surpassing his eight wins and 4.92 ERA of 1925. Offensively, the Cardinals were led by Jim Bottomley, Rogers Hornsby (who had batted over .400 in 1925) and catcher Bob O'Farrell, 1926 National League MVP-to-be.\nThe 1926 NL pennant race was heated. During the second and third weeks of September, both the Cardinals and the Reds had multi-game winning streaks and traded first and second place almost every day. On September 17, the Cards took a one-game lead over the Reds and extended their lead when the Reds lost several games in a row. They lost the last game of the season to the Reds on September 26, but still finished two games ahead of them in first place in the final standings.\nThe Yankees had the best record in the AL at 91–63, finishing three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and greatly improving on their 69-win, seventh-place 1925 season. Lou Gehrig played his first full season as the Yankees' starting first baseman, and the team traded for rookie shortstop Tony Lazzeri in the offseason, eventually playing him at second base. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Ruth led the offense, while Pennock and Urban Shocker led the starting rotation with 42 wins between them.\nIn early September 1926, thousands of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians would win the pennant even when they trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians were only two games behind New York, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind.\nOn September 11, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis met with representatives from four of the top teams in each of the two major leagues. The group gave home field to the AL for World Series Games 1–2 (scheduled for October 2 and 3) and 6–7, while the NL would host Games 3–5. Each game was to start at 1:30 p.m. local time.\nSome bookmakers made the Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched. One \"New York Times\" writer found \"little justification for installing either team as the favorite\". Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, \"We're going to come through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's what it takes to win. ... We're going to beat the Yankees. Any of my ball players will tell you that, and we expect to do it.\" Yankee skipper Miller Huggins retorted, \nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nYankee Stadium was filled with 61,658 fans on October 2 for Game 1. Those without tickets gathered at City Hall to watch the game's progress as charted on two large scoreboards. Before the start of the game, New York Supreme Court judge Robert F. Wagner, then a candidate for the United States Senate, threw out the ceremonial first pitch and took his position in the VIP box next to New York City mayor Jimmy Walker. Commissioner Landis and former heavyweight champion of the world Jack Dempsey were also in attendance. Southpaw Bill Sherdel started for the Cardinals, having posted a 16–12 record with 235 innings pitched in the regular season. The Yankees started Pennock, the team's only 20-game winner that season. The future Hall of Fame pitcher, nicknamed \"The Knight of Kennett Square\" for his hometown, had a 3.62 ERA in 266 innings during the regular season, and had finished third in the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting behind winner George Burns and runner-up Johnny Mostil.\nTaylor Douthit led off Game 1 with a double to left, advanced to third on Southworth's slow grounder to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, stayed there on Hornsby's comebacker right to Pennock but came home on \"Sunny Jim\" Bottomley's bloop single for the first run of the Series. In the bottom half, Sherdel walked Earle Combs, Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel, to load the bases. Gehrig scored Combs with a fielder's choice grounder for his first World Series run batted in (RBI), reaching first ahead of the relay. The Cardinals and Yankees were tied 1–1 after the first inning.\nIn the bottom of the third, Ruth singled and Meusel bunted him over, but Ruth split his pants sliding into second, prompting radio announcer Graham McNamee to exclaim, \"Babe is the color of a red brick house!\" Doc Woods, the team's trainer, ran out and sewed up Ruth's pants, much to the amusement of the crowd.\nThe score was still tied at one apiece in the bottom of the sixth, just as rain began to fall. Ruth lined a single past third baseman Les Bell. Meusel again sacrificed Ruth to second. Gehrig followed with a single, scoring Ruth and giving the Yankees the lead. Lazzeri lined a shot to left but Gehrig, on a headfirst dive, was tagged out at third by Bell. Lazzeri advanced to second on the throw. Bell bobbled Dugan's grounder for an error to put runners at first and third, but Hank Severeid forced Dugan at second to end the inning. The Yankees maintained their one-run advantage through the end of the eighth inning.\nIn the top of the ninth, Bottomley singled off Pennock but could not advance, giving the Yankees a 2–1 win in Game 1. Gehrig was their offensive star with both of his team's RBI. Pennock went the distance, striking out four and yielding but three hits, two in the first and one in the ninth. Hard-luck loser Sherdel gave up only two runs and six hits while striking out one.\nGame 2.\nThe second game was played the next day, October 3, at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 63,600. Urban Shocker was the starting pitcher for the Yankees. With 19 wins and 11 losses, Shocker had the second-best pitching record on the team, behind the Game 1 starter, southpaw Herb Pennock. Shocker had a 3.38 ERA in 258 innings, along with 59 strikeouts in the 1926 season. The Cardinals' Game 2 starter was 39-year-old Grover Cleveland \"Old Pete\" Alexander, a veteran player in his 16th major league season. That season, he posted numbers considerably lower than the pitching season statistics from his prime in the late 1910s with the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs. Alexander had compiled a 12–10 record in 200 innings, while posting a 3.05 ERA and 48 strikeouts, compared to the nearly 250 strikeouts he had in 1915 with the Phillies.\nThe Cardinals were first to bat in the game. After giving up a double to Rogers Hornsby, Shocker got a groundout from Jim Bottomley to end the run-scoring threat. In the Yankees' half of the inning, Mark Koenig grounded into a double play, and Babe Ruth followed by striking out. The Cardinals threatened again in the second inning, after back-to-back singles by catcher Bob O'Farrell and shortstop Tommy Thevenow. However, Alexander came to the plate and popped up to Koenig to end the inning. The Yankees scored first in the bottom of the second inning. Bob Meusel hit a single into center field, and Lou Gehrig followed by hitting a grounder to Alexander, which advanced Meusel to second base. Tony Lazzeri then hit a single to left field that scored Meusel from second. Joe Dugan followed with a single of his own, moving Lazzeri to third base. On the following play, Yankees catcher Hank Severeid struck out, and Lazzeri then attempted to steal home plate. Alexander made an error on his throw to catcher Bob O'Farrell, and Lazzeri was able to slide into home plate for the second Yankees run of the inning. O'Farrell then threw the ball to Thevenow, but the tag was late and Dugan was called safe at second base. The inning ended when Alexander struck out Shocker.\nIn the third inning, Taylor Douthit hit an infield single to shortstop Koenig, and Billy Southworth followed with a single to left field, advancing Douthit to second base. Hornsby laid down a sacrifice bunt to Shocker, moving each runner up a base. Bottomley hit a single into left field, scoring both Douthit and Southworth. The next two batters, Les Bell and Chick Hafey, hit into outs to conclude the inning. In the top of the seventh inning. Bob O'Farrell lined a double, and Tommy Thevenow followed with a single into left field. Pitcher Alexander popped up to Lazzeri, and Douthit followed with a fly ball to left field. Southworth then hit a three-run home run, giving the Cardinals a 5–2 advantage over the Yankees. Hornsby then grounded out to Koenig to end the inning. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Dugan all grounded out in the bottom of the seventh inning. In the top of the eighth, Bottomley hit a single into right field. Yankees manager Miller Huggins came out of the dugout and took Shocker out of the game, calling in Bob Shawkey from the bullpen to replace him. Shawkey struck out the first two batters he faced, and Bottomley was tagged out after attempting to steal second base. The Yankees could not produce any runs in their half of the inning.\nIn the ninth inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, replaced Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow had only two other home runs in his career, both of which were inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.\nGame 3.\nAfter Game 2 ended on October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next afternoon so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and paid for by the city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100. As the Cardinals were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman's Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game 3 for a price of $3.30.\nSportsman's Park was filled with 37,708 people on October 5 for Game 3. On the mound for the Cardinals was right-handed knuckleball pitcher Jesse Haines, a future Hall of Famer with a 13–4 record and 3.25 ERA in 183 innings in 1926. Starting for the Yankees was southpaw pitcher Dutch Ruether, who had a 14–9 record with a 4.60 ERA in 1926.\nThe game was rain delayed for 30 minutes during the top half of the fourth inning. Once the game resumed, the Cardinals came to bat and scored the first runs of the game. Les Bell, a .325 hitter with 17 home runs that season, led the Cardinals with a single to center field. Chick Hafey dropped a sacrifice bunt straight to Ruether, who then threw it to second baseman Tony Lazzeri. Bell beat Lazzeri's tag at second base and was called safe by the umpire. Bob O'Farrell was walked, and Tommy Thevenow hit a grounder to Lazzeri, who tossed it to Mark Koenig for the force out at second base. Koenig tagged O'Farrell out, but made an error in his throw to first baseman Lou Gehrig, which resulted in a run. Then, Haines hit a Ruether pitch for a two-run home run.\nThe Cardinals were leading the Yankees 3–0 by the end of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home following a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete-game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.\nGame 4.\nFuture Hall of Famer Waite Hoyt started Game 4 for the Yankees at Sportsman's Park on October 6. Hoyt had a 16–12 record with a 3.85 ERA in 218 innings for the 1926 season. This was Hoyt's fourth World Series with the Yankees, and he entered the 1926 Series with over 35 innings of pitching experience in the championship series. He was opposed by Flint Rhem, the Cardinals' 20-game winner who had led the team with both a .741 winning percentage and 258 innings pitched.\nIn the first inning, after striking out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem gave up a home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came into the bottom of the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.\nThe Cardinals responded by scoring three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning. With one out and no runners on the bases, Hafey hit a single. O'Farrell followed and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O'Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O'Farrell to third base. Cardinals' manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed infielder Specs Toporczer to pinch hit for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a fly ball to Earle Combs in center field, upon which O'Farrell promptly tagged up to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.\nTo start the top of the fifth inning, Art Reinhart was put in as pitcher. Reinhart walked Combs and followed by giving up a run-scoring double to Koenig. He then walked Ruth and Meusel in succession to load the bases for Gehrig. Reinhart walked Gehrig, allowing Koenig to score and keeping the bases loaded with no outs. Hi Bell replaced Reinhart as pitcher, but he was not able to suppress the Yankees' offense. Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly to right field, which scored Ruth and moved Meusel up to third base. Dugan then hit a weak groundball; he was thrown out at first by catcher O'Farrell, but Meusel scored and Gehrig went to second base. Bell then balked, moving Gehrig to third base. Severeid was walked, and pitcher Hoyt ended the inning by hitting into a force play at second base.\nThe Yankees expanded on their three-run lead in the next inning. After the entire Yankees lineup batted in the fifth inning, Combs was back at the plate to start the sixth. Combs hit an infield single past shortstop Thevenow. Koenig followed by striking out. Ruth, with two home runs already in the game, came up to the plate. The count on Ruth went up to three balls and two strikes before he hit a long home run. Ruth's three home runs was a feat equaled only thrice since. As one of the game announcers (either McNamee or Carlin) described the situation:\nIt was measured at over and had cleared the wall in center field, crashing through the window of an auto dealer across the street from the stadium. Locals claimed it was the longest home run ever hit in St. Louis. Meusel then hit a single in right field, but was tagged out as he tried to head for second base. Gehrig followed with a double to the opposite side, but could not score when Lazzeri popped up to Thevenow to end the inning.\nIn the seventh inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time southpaw Bill Hallahan, who served as both a starter and reliever for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10–4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game 5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.\nBabe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester.\nThe 1926 World Series produced one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, \"I'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday\". After Ruth hit three home runs in Game 4 on October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which the boy said to Ruth, \"I'm sorry the Yanks lost the series\". In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, \"Now who the hell is Johnny Sylvester?\"\nThere have been many alternate versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in \"The Babe Ruth Story\", claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would hit a home run for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would \"try to knock you another homer, maybe two today\". Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion. Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized, dying, or if Ruth's three home runs had actually saved the boy's life, as claimed by the newspapers.\nGame 5.\nGame 5, played at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis on October 7, featured a rematch between Game 1 starters Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel. Pennock had pitched a complete game three-hitter in the 2–1 Yankees victory, while Sherdel had pitched seven innings, giving up two runs and six hits.\nThrough the first three innings of the fifth game, both pitchers held the opposing team to no runs and a limited number of hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm.\nThe Cardinals came back to take the lead in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, advancing Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.\nThe Yankees immediately took advantage of Sherdel in the top of the tenth inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at first base, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was hit by a pitch from Sherdel. With the bases loaded again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3–2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters.\nGame 6.\nThe teams moved back to Yankee Stadium for Game 6. Over 48,000 fans came into Yankee Stadium on October 9 to see if the Yankees could win their second World Series in franchise history. The game's pitching matchup was between Grover Cleveland Alexander and Bob Shawkey, both of whom had made appearances in previous games in the series. Shawkey had come in as relief in Games 2 and 3, while Alexander had pitched a complete game against the Yankees in the Cardinals' Game 2 victory. In the 1926 season, Shawkey had made most of his pitching appearances in relief, and had been an occasional starter on the Yankees rotation. He started 10 of his 29 total pitching appearances and posted an 8–7 record with a 3.62 earned run average.\nThe game was lopsided from the start. In the top of the first inning, Shawkey gave up three runs on three hits, with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley double and Les Bell single. Alexander encountered a minor setback in the fourth inning. To open up the bottom of the inning, Bob Meusel launched a triple into left field and scored on the following ground out by Lou Gehrig. Alexander shut down the Yankees for the rest of the inning, and the Cardinals held on to a 3–1 lead. In the top of the fifth inning, the Cardinals expanded their two-run lead. Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth. Alexander laid down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig, but was successful in advancing Thevenow to second base. Wattie Holm, substituting for Taylor Douthit as center fielder, followed by hitting a single into center field, scoring Thevenow on the play. Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning.\nThe Cardinals scored again in the top of the seventh inning. Thevenow again led the inning by hitting a single into left field. Alexander bunted right in front of the plate. Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, but Lazzeri made an error on the play, and both runners were safe at their respective bases. Holm followed by hitting a weak grounder that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base. With runners at first and second base, Southworth lined a double right by Ruth, scoring Alexander and sending Holm to third base. Urban Shocker, the starter in Game 2, then came in to relieve Shawkey as pitcher. Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center field, allowing Holm and Southworth to score. Bottomley then hit a grounder to shortstop Mark Koenig, who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out on the force play. Bell followed with a two-run home run, extending the Cardinals' lead to 9–1. Chick Hafey lined a double into left field, but Bob O'Farrell ended the inning by striking out. In the bottom of the seventh inning, the Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals' lead to seven runs.\nIn the eighth inning, Myles Thomas came in to relieve Shocker, who had given up three hits and two unearned runs in less than an inning of work. Meanwhile, Alexander shut down the Yankees offense for the rest of the game. In the top of the ninth inning, the Cardinals increased their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an RBI groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up 13 hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.\nGame 7.\nThe deciding Game 7 was played on October 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 38,093 people. The game featured two future Hall of Famers, who were both winners in their respective pitching appearances earlier in the series. Jesse Haines took to the mound for the Cardinals; he had pitched in relief in Game 1 and threw a complete-game shutout against the Yankees in Game 3. Waite Hoyt had pitched a complete-game 10–5 Yankees victory in Game 4.\nThe Yankees scored the first run of the game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth home run into the right field bleachers. In the following half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.\nIn the sixth inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid followed with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game 1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.\nRogers Hornsby had to determine who he would put in to replace Haines as pitcher. Although Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a complete game the day before and may have spent the night drinking (Alexander later denied this, saying that Hornsby specifically told him to limit his celebrating since he might be needed the next day), Hornsby decided to trust him after Alexander said he \"had it in easy in there\" in Game 6 and would be ready whenever Hornsby needed him. According to the popular legend, Alexander told Hornsby his strategy: After getting a strike on Lazzeri, Alexander would then throw an inside fastball. Hornsby warned him that that pitch was Lazzeri's favorite. Alexander responded that if Lazzeri swung at it, he would hit it foul, and Alexander would then throw an outside curve to strike him out. Hornsby then supposedly said, \"Who am I to tell \"you\" how to pitch?\" The first two pitches thrown by Alexander to batter Tony Lazzeri went for a strike and a ball, respectively. On the third pitch, Lazzeri hit a fly ball down the left-field line. The ball initially appeared to be going into the stands for a grand slam, but at the last second, it curved several feet into the stands in foul territory. Alexander then threw a curveball that Lazzeri swung at and missed for strike three, ending the inning and the Yankees' threat.\nAlexander retired the Yankees in order in the eighth inning. The Cardinals did nothing offensively in the top of the ninth inning, so it was up to Alexander to preserve the Cardinals' game in the bottom of the ninth. Alexander got the first two batters of the inning, Combs and Dugan, to ground out to third baseman Bell. With two outs and no runners on base, Alexander faced Ruth. Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game. Manager Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander. Alexander told Hornsby that he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him. Alexander's first pitch to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate. Alexander's next pitch fell outside of the strike zone for ball one. Ruth then fouled the next pitch, making the count one ball and two strikes. Alexander's next two pitches fell too low for balls two and three, making it a full count. The following full count pitch was noted by \"New York Herald Tribune\" sportswriter W. O. McGeehan: \"The count went to three and two, Ruth was swaying eagerly. The soupbone creaked again. The ball seemed a fraction of an inch from being a strike. Ruth paused a moment. Even he was uncertain. Then he trotted down to first.\"\nWith two outs and Ruth at first base, left fielder Bob Meusel came up to the plate, with Lou Gehrig waiting in the batting circle after him. Meusel was a .315 hitter that year and had batted in 81 runs in just over 100 regular-season games. Meusel also had success in Game 6 against Alexander, with a double and triple. Just as Meusel was about to take his first pitch, Ruth made the bold move of trying to steal second base. Ruth was known as a good but overly aggressive baserunner, with about a 50% success rate at stealing bases in his career, and his attempt surprised many people throughout the stadium. Meusel swung and missed, and Cardinals catcher Bob O'Farrell immediately threw the ball to second baseman Hornsby. Hornsby reached for the ball, and laid the tag immediately on Ruth. As the game announcer described it, \"Ruth is walked again for the fourth time today. One strike on Bob Meusel. Going down to second! The game is over! Babe tried to steal second and is put out catcher to second!\"\nAs Hornsby recalled later, Ruth \"didn't say a word. He didn't even look around or up at me. He just picked himself up and walked away\". Ruth's failed attempt to steal second base ended the 1926 World Series; it is the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.\nAftermath.\nThe Cardinals went back home to St. Louis to a rapturous fan reception, having won their first undisputed world championship. Each member of the championship team collected $5,584.51, while the Yankees' players were given $3,417.75 each.\nTo date, the Cardinals' 11 world championships are the most won by any National League team, and rank second only to the Yankees' 27. The Cardinals' and Yankees' last wins were within two years of each other (having occurred in 2011 and 2009, respectively). The two teams would meet again in 1928 (which the Yankees swept in four games); 1942 (which the Cardinals won in five games); 1943 (which the Yankees won in five games); and 1964 (which the Cardinals won in seven games).\nAs for the Yankees, Game 7 of the 1926 series marked the last postseason loss for the team in a decade. The Bronx Bombers would go on to sweep their next three World Series, 1927, 1928, and 1932. Their next World Series loss would be Game 1 of the 1936 World Series which the Yankees would eventually win 4 games to 2."

        "text": "The 1927 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1927 season. The 24th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees against the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates. The Yankees won in four games. This was the first sweep of a National League team by an American League team.\nThat year, the Yankees led the American League in runs scored, hits, triples, home runs, base on balls, batting average, slugging average and on-base percentage. It featured legends Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig at their peaks. The team won a then-league record 110 games, finished with a 19-game lead over second place, and are considered by many to be the greatest team in the history of baseball.\nThe 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates, with MVP Paul Waner, led the National League in runs, hits, batting average and on-base percentage.\nTeams.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe 1927 New York Yankees had perhaps the most feared line-up in the history of baseball. Nicknamed \"Murderers Row,\" with Babe Ruth at the peak of his considerable powers, hitting .356 with a then-record 60 home runs and 164 RBI that year. He was complemented by future Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig at first base, who hit .373 with 47 home runs and a league-leading 175 RBI, Tony Lazzeri at second base who drove in 102 runs with a .309 average, and center fielder Earle Combs, who hit .356 and scored 137 runs as the team's leadoff hitter. Left fielder Bob Meusel also drove in over 100 runs, with a .337 average.\nThe team's pitching staff was led by another Hall of Famer, Waite Hoyt, who had his best season with a 22–7 record and a league-leading 2.63 ERA to add to his league-leading wins total. Three more pitchers won 18 or more games, rookie Wilcy Moore (19–7, 2.28), Herb Pennock (19–8, 3.00) and Urban Shocker (18–6, 2.84). Moore would have won the ERA title under current rules, but in those days qualification was based on the number of complete games pitched, and he made only 12 starts all year: 13 of his wins and a league-leading 13 saves (figured retroactively) came during his 38 relief appearances. Rounding out the staff were veteran Dutch Ruether (13–6, 3.38), George Pipgras (10–3, 4.11) and swingman Myles Thomas (7–4, 4.87).\nTo no one's surprise, the Yankees ran away with the pennant under the leadership of manager Miller Huggins. They finished with a record of 110–44, 19 games in front of the second-place Philadelphia Athletics. They were overwhelming favorites to win the World Series.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nThe 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates were by no means a weak team, but they certainly suffer in comparison with their American League rivals. The Pirates went 94–60 for manager Donie Bush during the regular season, finishing games ahead of the defending World Champions St. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Pirates also had their share of future Hall of Famers, but they were not quite of the caliber of those of the Yankees. The team's best hitter was right fielder Paul \"Big Poison\" Waner, who hit a league-leading .380 and drove in 131 runs, also a league-leading total. His brother, rookie center fielder Lloyd \"Little Poison\" Waner hit .355 and scored a league-leading 133 runs, in spite of his almost complete lack of power (he collected just 25 extra-base hits in over 650 plate appearances). Third baseman Pie Traynor hit .342 and drove in over 100 runs, joining shortstop Glenn Wright who also topped the century mark. However, Wright and Paul Waner also led the team in home runs with 9 each, underscoring the huge difference in power with their rivals: the Pirates hit 54 home runs as a team, fewer than Babe Ruth by himself, and barely a third as many as the Yankees' 158.\nOther solid hitters for the Pirates included first baseman Joe Harris, who hit .326 with 73 RBI, second baseman George Grantham (.305) and left fielder Clyde Barnhart (.319). In fact, catcher Johnny Gooch, who hit .258, was the only regular besides Wright to hit below .300, and back-up outfielder Kiki Cuyler added his own .309 average in 285 at-bats to the parade, as the Pirates batted .305 as a team—pitchers included.\nThe Pirates' pitching was not as dominant. Two veterans of the 1925 World Championship team, Lee Meadows and Ray Kremer both posted 19 wins, with Kremer leading the league with a 2.47 ERA. Carmen Hill had pitched part of six seasons in the majors before 1927, never winning more than three games. In 1927, he put everything together, winning a team-leading 22 games against 11 losses, with a 3.24 ERA at age 31. Vic Aldridge went 15–10 as the fourth starter, but his 4.25 ERA was well over the league average. In the bullpen, Johnny Miljus put together a good season, posting a 1.90 ERA in 76 innings, with an 8–3 record.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe 1927 World Series opened under sunny skies and balmy weather at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, October 5. The crowd of 41,467 saw Yankee right-hander Waite Hoyt (22–6, 2.64 ERA) and Pirate ace Ray Kremer (19–8, 2.47 ERA) oppose each other in Game 1.\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, John S. Fisher was at Forbes Field, as well as New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was seated near the Yankees' dugout. National League President John A. Heydler was in another field box.\nAdding to the festivities was a brass band in red coats that paraded around the field before the game. The photographers took pictures of Pirates' Manager Donie Bush and the Yankees' Miller Huggins shaking hands. The Babe was photographed with Huggins, Bush, Mayor Walker, Lou Gehrig, and the Waners.\nWhen the game started, Earle Combs hit the first ball Kremer threw and drove it deep to left field, where Clyde Barnhart caught it. After Mark Koenig struck out swinging, Babe Ruth came up. He swung at the first ball and singled to right field for the first hit of the series. Then on a count of three and two, Gehrig hit a short fly to right field. Paul Waner tried to make a shoestring catch, but the ball got through him for a triple and Ruth scored.\nIn the bottom of the first, the Pirates tied the game at one. Lloyd Waner was hit by a pitch, moved to third on his brother's double, and tagged up on Glenn Wright's sacrifice fly. With one out in the third, second baseman George Grantham kicked Koenig's grounder behind first base for an error. Ruth again hit Kremer's first pitch and smashed a single to right, sending Koenig to third. Gehrig walked.\nWith the bases loaded, Kremer walked Bob Meusel, forcing home Koenig. Tony Lazzeri then grounded to Wright, who got the ball to second in time to force Meusel, but Grantham could not get rid of it in time to complete a double play. Ruth scored. With Gehrig on third and Lazzeri on first, a double steal was attempted. Catcher Earl Smith made a bluff throw to second and then threw to Pie Traynor at third, catching Gehrig halfway between the bases, but Smith let Traynor's return throw to the plate get past him for an error. Gehrig scored. The Yankees led 4–1.\nThe Pirates picked up one run in the bottom of the third on Kremer's double and Paul Waner's single, making the score 4–2. After Hoyt developed a blister on a finger of his pitching hand in the fourth, Huggins watched him carefully. Koenig doubled to center in the fifth and went to third when Ruth grounded out to Grantham. Gehrig's sacrifice fly to Paul Waner scored Koenig.\nThe Pirates came back with one run in the bottom of the inning on Lloyd Waner's double and Barnhart's single to left. After Lazzeri doubled in the sixth, Pirates Manager Donie Bush lifted Kremer and brought in right-hander Johnny Miljus, who retired the side.\nPittsburgh came up in the eighth trailing 5–3. Wright lined a single over Lazzeri's head. Then Traynor lined a single to center. Wright stopped at second. Huggins decided that Hoyt had had enough and called for Wilcy Moore.\nGrantham grounded to Gehrig who threw to Koenig in time to force Traynor at second. On the play, Koenig was bowled over and had the air knocked out of him. Wright went to third on the play and scored on Joe Harris's single to center, making the score 5–4. On a daring run and long slide, Grantham beat Combs's throw to third. Smith then grounded to Gehrig, who stepped on first to end the inning. Moore retired the Pirates in order in the ninth. The Yankees won Game 1 of the World Series, 5–4.\nGame 2.\n41,634 were in attendance for Game 2.\nThe Pirates opened the scoring in the bottom of the first. Lloyd Waner tripled down the left field foul line, and Clyde Barnhart drove Ruth up against the concrete wall in right on his sacrifice fly scoring Waner. The Pirates led 1–0.\nIn the top of the third, Combs singled between Harris and Grantham and raced to third on Koenig's line single over second, scoring on Lloyd Waner's fumble sending Koenig around to third. Ruth's high sacrifice fly to Lloyd Waner scored Koenig. Gehrig doubled to the exit gate in right-center. Wright then made an acrobatic diving stop of Meusel's drive headed for left field but couldn't regain his balance in time to throw Meusel out, Gehrig reaching third base and scoring on Lazzeri's sacrifice fly to Paul Waner. The Yankees led 3–1.\nPipgras pitched beautifully, with a blazing fastball and a sharp-breaking curve, scattering six hits over seven innings. In the top of the eighth, Meusel singled over second. On a hit-and-run play, Lazzeri singled to right, Meusel racing to third. When Aldridge's wild pitch almost knocked Dugan down, Meusel scored and Lazzeri went to second. Dugan attempted a sacrifice bunt, but catcher Johnny Gooch pounced on the ball and threw to third base to get Lazzeri sliding in.\nAldridge then walked Benny Bengough and Pipgras, and southpaw Mike Cvengros relieved him. He hit Combs forcing in Dugan, and gave up a single to Koenig scoring Bengough. The Yankees led 6–1, and held on to win 6–2.\nGame 3.\nThe Series moved to New York for Game 3 without a travel day off.\nStarter Herb Pennock retired leadoff hitter Lloyd Waner on an easy roller to Koenig. Rhyne and Paul Waner both flied to Meusel in left. With the Yankees up in the first, on a count of two and two, leadoff hitter Combs slapped a single over second. Koenig got an infield hit on a ground ball that bounced off starter Lee Meadows' glove and was kicked around by Rhyne, Combs reaching second. After Ruth popped to Wright behind second, Gehrig got hold of a fastball and drove it to the warning track in left-center for a triple scoring both Combs and Koenig, but was thrown out at the plate trying for an inside-the-park home run. The Yankees led 2–0.\nPennock was in total control. He retired the Pirates in order without a hit over the first seven innings. Lazzeri opened the home half of the seventh with a single into short center, only the fifth hit of the game, all by the Yanks. Dugan bunted him to second and beat the throw to first. Huggins sent up Cedric Durst to bat for Grabowski. His grounder moved Lazzeri to third and Dugan to second. Rhyne fielded Pennock's slow grounder but threw to the plate too late to get Lazzeri, Dugan taking third and Pennock reaching first. Koenig's deep double to right wall scored Pennock and put Combs on third. Lefthander Mike Cvengros relieved Meadows, but Ruth crushed a home run high into the right-field bleachers, the crowd cheering wildly as he trotted around the bases behind Combs and Koenig. The inning finally ended when Cvengros struck out Gehrig and Meusel. The Yankees led 8–0, and held on for an 8–1 win. Pennock finished with a three-hitter, walking none.\nGame 4.\nLooking to become the manager of the first American League club to sweep a World Series in four straight games, Huggins sent Wilcy Moore to the mound against the Pirates' Carmen Hill for Game 4.\nLloyd Waner led off the game with a drive off Moore's glove and beat it out for a hit. Koenig threw out Barnhart, sending Little Poison to second. Wright singled to right, scoring Waner. The Yanks tied the game at one in the bottom of the first when the first three hitters, Combs, Koenig and Ruth, all singled to right.\nIn the bottom of the fifth inning, Combs singled to short center. Koenig struck out swinging but Ruth hit his second home run of the Series, to deep center. The Yankees led 3–1.\nIn the top of the seventh inning, Smith would have grounded out third to first base, but Moore dropped Gehrig's toss for an error. Pitcher Emil Yde ran for Smith, and Fred Brickell batted for Hill. Lazzeri, in his haste to make a double play on Brickell's grounder, bobbled the ball and both runners reached, Yde taking second and Brickell making it to first. Lloyd Waner's sacrifice bunt moved them up. Barnhart's single over second scored Yde and sent Brickell to third. Paul Waner's sacrifice fly to center scored Brickell, tying the score at three apiece.\nThere was a new battery for the Pirates in the bottom of the seventh, Johnny Miljus and catcher Johnny Gooch. The score remained tied through the seventh, the eighth and the top of the ninth, bringing the Yanks up in their half of the ninth with a chance to win the game and the series. Miljus opened with a walk to Combs. Koenig beat out a bunt down the third base line for a single, bringing Ruth up. Miljus' wild pitch sent Combs to third and Koenig to second, and manager Bush ordered Miljus to walk Ruth, loading the bases for Gehrig, who struck out swinging\nas did Meusel looking. Lazzeri fouled deep into the left field bleachers for strike one, but on the next pitch Miljus uncorked another wild pitch. Combs raced home with the winning run, and the Series was over with the Yankees winning 4–3. To date, this is the only World Series to end with a runner scoring on a wild pitch.\nComposite line score.\n1927 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Pittsburgh Pirates (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1928 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1928 season. The 25th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees versus the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Yankees beat the Cardinals in four games to win their third championship and become the first team to do back-to-back sweeps.\nBabe Ruth hit .625 (10 for 16) as the Yankees outscored their opponents by a combined score of 27–10. As he had done against the Cards in the Series, Ruth hit three home runs over the right field pavilion in Sportsman's Park in Game 4, the only player to do it in two different World Series through the 2016 season. Unlike 1926, however, it occurred in the final game of a Series won by the Yanks and finished off their two consecutive World Series sweeps.\nLou Gehrig also had a good Series, hitting .545 (6 for 11) with four home runs. He drove in as many runs by himself (9) as the entire Cardinal team combined.\nBill McKechnie became the second manager to lead two different teams to the World Series, and like Pat Moran before him, won one and lost one.\nBackground.\nBefore the series started, Walter Johnson, a retired Major League pitcher at the time, reportedly predicted that the Cardinals would \"make short work of the New York Yankees,\" and that the Yankees \"(hadn't) looked good for a while.\" Both Cardinals and Yankees fans were looking forward to a rematch of the 1926 World Series, which the Cardinals won.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn a fashion similar to 1926, Bill Sherdel took the mound in Game 1 for the Cardinals.\nRuth doubled with 2 outs in the first inning. Gehrig followed with an RBI double. Ruth lashed another double in the fourth and scored ahead of Bob Meusel's home run, one of only four hits off Sherdel in his seven innings. Consecutive singles by Mark Koenig, Ruth and Gehrig-for his second RBI-against Cards reliever Syl Johnson gave the Yankees the 4th run and a 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nThe Cardinals produced 30 percent (3) of their runs in the Series in the second inning of game 2.\nGeorge Harper walked, Jimmie Wilson doubled, Rabbit Maranville singled, and Grover Cleveland Alexander reached on second baseman Tony Lazzeri's errant throw. It tied the game at 3–3.\nAfter that, George Pipgras allowed only two more Cardinal hits, walking 3 other St. Louis batters. Miller Huggins had helped him straighten out a delivery problem. Pipgras consistently struck out the Cardinals with his curveballs, and they didn't score again.\nNew York went ahead 4–3 in the bottom of the second inning off Alexander, who did not do well after that. Ruth led off with a single. Gehrig, having homered earlier (in the first inning to give the Yankees a 3–0 lead), drew a walk, and Meusel drove in a run with a double.\nA hit batsman and another run-scoring hit gave the Yankees a 4-run lead, and that was how it ended.\nGame 3.\nThe Redbirds, as the Cardinals were affectionately called by fans, led only 3 times the entire series and held an advantage in this game for 3 innings, the longest span in the series. They put up a 2–0 score in the 1st inning on singles by Andy High and Frankie Frisch, followed by a line drive that center fielder Cedric Durst couldn't catch, giving Jim Bottomley a 2-run double.\nThe only other St. Louis run came in the 5th inning, when Taylor Douthit was hit by a pitch and scored to make it a 3–3 game on High's double.\nWhere the Cardinals had to scrape together runs, the Yankees did not. Gehrig homered into the right-field pavilion. In the fourth inning, Ruth laced a single and Gehrig followed with a hard line drive that skipped over the head of charging fielder Douthit. The ball rolled to the fence, and Gehrig went around the bases for a two-run inside-the-park homer.\nRuth took to the bases again in the sixth inning when his grounder forced out Koenig. Gehrig then drew a walk. 3rd baseman High fielded Meusel's bouncer and tried to start a double play. His throw got Gehrig at second, but Frisch's relay went wild and rolled to the fence. As Bottomley scampered after the ball, Ruth rounded third base and headed for home. The throw beat him, and umpire Bill McGowan called him out, but the impact from Ruth's hit in the collision jarred the ball loose from catcher Jimmie Wilson, and McGowan changed the call.\nLater in the inning, Meusel scored on a double steal. The Yankees scored another run that inning to make it 6–3. Another run in the seventh was their last of the game, making it 7-3.\nGame 4.\nAfter Game 3, Cardinals manager Bill McKechnie was still hopeful, despite losing 3 games in a row. \"It[sic] they can win three games, so can we. Nothing is impossible. And this thing isn't over until the fourth game is won,\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe Cards led 2–1 in the top of the seventh. 21-game-winning southpaw Will Sherdel had an 0–2 count on Babe Ruth, who turned to say something to catcher Earl Smith. Seizing what he thought was a great opportunity to end the at-bat, Sherdel \"quick-pitched\", or threw without a windup, for what he thought was strike three on the Babe. \"Quick pitches\" were legal in the National League, but not in the American League or the World Series. So NL plate umpire Cy Pfirman called \"no pitch\", causing a vociferous argument with the Cardinals. Ruth then took two balls to even the count at 2–2 before homering to tie the game at two apiece. Gehrig's ensuing back-to-back home run, his fourth of the Series, gave the Yanks a lead they never relinquished. They scored twice more in the seventh, and Ruth finished the inning off with his third homer of the game in the two-run Yankee eighth.\nSt. Louis scored a lone run in the bottom of the ninth to make it 7–3, but that was their last, as future Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch hit a left field foul fly caught on the run by none other than the Babe Ruth up against the stands, as angry Cardinal fans swatted him with newspapers and programs. But Ruth merely kept running right into the dugout, holding the ball in the air and giving the Yankees their second straight World Series sweep.\nIn 1930, Ruth called this game the biggest thrill of his career.\nComposite line score.\n1928 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)\nBroadcast.\nSince 1922, World Series games were broadcast by radio. The announcers for this years Series were Graham McNamee and Phillips Carlin for NBC's radio network. For CBS, J. Andrew White and Ted Husing."

        "title": "1929 World Series",
        "text": "The 1929 World Series featured the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics playing against the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs. The Athletics defeated the Cubs in five games to win the Series.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThis was the first World Series game ever played at Wrigley Field.\nBecause seven of the eight regulars in the Cubs' lineup hit right-handed, Athletics manager Connie Mack started only right-handed pitchers during the series and kept all his left-handed pitchers in the bullpen, even though two of his best starters, Lefty Grove and Rube Walberg, were left-handed.\nThe Athletics' Howard Ehmke, who started his major league career in 1915, had been a good starting pitcher, but by 1929, he was suffering from a sore arm. Pitching only occasionally, he finished the regular season with a 7–2 record, a 3.29 earned run average, and 20 strikeouts in 54.2 innings. Meanwhile, the Athletics had a big lead in the AL standings. In August, Mack told Ehmke that he was going to be released after the season. Ehmke accepted the decision but said that he would like to pitch in a World Series game, having never done so before. In mid-September, with both league pennant races wrapped up, Mack had Ehmke leave the team and go on the road to scout the NL champion Cubs for the last few weeks of the season, telling him to be prepared to start game 1 of the World Series.\nMack kept the pitching decision a secret until the day of the game. The Athletics had plenty of good pitchers available, and players on both teams were surprised that Ehmke was starting. However, with his knowledge of the Cubs' batters and a rested arm, Ehmke pitched a complete game, winning 3–1 with no earned runs allowed and 13 strikeouts. The strikeout total broke the World Series record that had been set by Ed Walsh in 1906; Ehmke's record then stood until it was broken by Carl Erskine in 1953. This ended up being the last win of Ehmke's career and also became one of the most famous games in baseball history.\nAttending the game was nine-year-old John Paul Stevens, who would grow up to become a Supreme Court Justice. A lifelong Cubs fan, Stevens later said, \"And that was my first game, a tragic game for a young boy to go and see in person!\"\nGame 2.\nBehind the pitching of George Earnshaw and Grove, the Athletics won 9–3 and took a 2–0 lead in the series. Jimmie Foxx became the first player to homer in his first two World Series games. Al Simmons also homered and had four runs batted in.\nGame 3.\nGame 3 was a pitchers' duel that featured many tense moments. Guy Bush won this game for the Cubs' only victory, holding the Athletics to one run despite allowing nine hits and two walks. Earnshaw started his second straight game for the Athletics and allowed only one earned run himself.\nGame 4.\nSticking to his right-handed-pitchers-only policy, Mack again made a risky move in Game 4 by starting 46-year-old Jack Quinn. Unlike Ehmke, however, Quinn was no challenge to the Cubs' hitters, who scored seven runs off him before Mack pulled him in the sixth inning.\nTrailing 8–0, the Athletics then scored 10 runs in the bottom of the seventh inning and won the game. In the middle of the rally that became known as the \"Mack Attack\", Cubs center fielder Hack Wilson lost Mule Haas's fly ball in the sun, and Haas circled the bases for a three-run inside-the-park home run, bringing the Athletics to within a run at 8–7. This was the last inside-the-park home run in a World Series game until Game 1 of the 2015 World Series. The eight-run deficit overcome by the Athletics is still the largest in postseason history.\nArt Nehf's relief pitching appearance in this game was his last in the major leagues.\nGame 5.\nMack gave Ehmke his second start of the Series, but without the advantage of surprise, he was less effective, touched for two runs, and taken out in the fourth inning. The Athletics trailed 2–0 going into the bottom of the ninth. However, Haas tied the game up with a two-run homer.

        "title": "1919 World Series",
        "text": "The 1919 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 1919 season. The 16th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Chicago White Sox against the National League champion Cincinnati Reds. Although most World Series have been of the best-of-seven format, the 1919 World Series was a best-of-nine series (along with , , and ). MLB decided to try the best-of-nine format partly to increase popularity of the sport and partly to generate more revenue.\nThe events of the 1919 World Series are often associated with the Black Sox Scandal, in which several members of the Chicago franchise conspired with gamblers, allegedly led by organized crime figure Arnold Rothstein, to throw the series. It was the last World Series to take place without a Commissioner of Baseball in place. In 1920, the various franchise owners installed Kenesaw Mountain Landis as the first \"Commissioner of Baseball\".\nIn August 1921, despite being acquitted from criminal charges, eight players from the White Sox were banned from organized baseball for either fixing the series or having knowledge about the fix without alerting the league.\nTeams.\nChicago White Sox.\nIn 1919, the Chicago White Sox, who had won the World Series two years earlier, had the best record in the American League (AL). Most of the same players had defeated the New York Giants in the 1917 series, four games to two. They had fallen to sixth place in the American League in 1918, largely as a result of losing their best player, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and a few other teammates to World War I service. The team's owner, Charles Comiskey, fired manager Pants Rowland after the season and replaced him with William \"Kid\" Gleason, who had played over twenty years in the majors but had never managed before. The 88–52 White Sox won the American League pennant again in 1919, by games over the Cleveland Indians (world champions the following year).\nJackson was the unquestioned star of the White Sox. The left fielder hit .351 that season, fourth in the league and in the AL's top five in slugging percentage, RBI, total bases and base hits. He was not the only star in a lineup with hardly a weak spot, as former Philadelphia Athletics superstar leadoff hitter Eddie Collins, one of the greatest second basemen of all time, was still going strong in his early thirties, hitting .319 with a .400 on-base percentage. Right fielder Nemo Leibold hit .302 with 81 runs scored. First baseman Chick Gandil hit .290, third baseman Buck Weaver .296, and center fielder Oscar \"Hap\" Felsch hit .275 and tied Jackson for the team lead in home runs with only seven (as the dead-ball era was coming to a close). Even typical \"good field, no hit\" catcher Ray Schalk hit .282 that year, and shortstop Swede Risberg was not an automatic out with the .256 average and 38 RBI. Gleason's bench contained two impressive hitters, outfielder Shano Collins and infielder Fred McMullin, both veterans of the 1917 series.\nThe 1919 pitching staff was led by a pair of aces and a very promising rookie. Knuckleballer Eddie Cicotte had become one of the AL's best pitchers after turning 30 and discovering the \"shine ball;\" he had won 28 games for the 1917 champions, and after an off-year in 1918 had come back with a hefty 29–7, leading the league in wins and second in earned run average to Washington's veteran \"Big Train\" Walter Johnson. Next came Claude \"Lefty\" Williams, at 23–11 and 2.64. Twenty-six-year-old rookie Dickie Kerr started only 17 games, but turned in a solid 13–7 and 2.88. Fourth in the rotation was Urban \"Red\" Faber, who had beaten the Giants three times in the 1917 series but had an off-year in 1919 at 11–9 and 3.83 in 20 starts. He was ill and unable to pitch in the 1919 series, limiting Gleason to three top-of-the-line starters for what could be nine games.\nHowever, all was not well in the White Sox camp. Tension ran high between many of the players and Comiskey given his penny-pinching ways, memorialized in two urban legends: (1) that he told Gleason to shut down Cicotte in the last days of the regular season to prevent him from winning thirty games, a milestone which would have earned him a sizeable $10,000 bonus; (2) that many derided the White Sox as the \"Black Sox\" because Comiskey wouldn't pay to have their uniforms laundered regularly, and they became blacker and blacker due to accumulated sweat, grime and dirt.\nCincinnati Reds.\nIn contrast to the White Sox, the 1919 Cincinnati Reds were upstarts. They had finished no higher than third since 1900, and then only twice, before winning the National League (NL) pennant handily in 1919. Under new manager Pat Moran, best known as the leader of another bunch of unlikely newcomers to the World Series, the 1915 Philadelphia Phillies, the Reds finished nine games in front of the runner-up Giants at 96–44 and at least twenty games ahead of the other six, with the second highest NL won-lost percentage since 1910 at .686.\nThe Reds' greatest star was center fielder Edd Roush, who led the league in hitting at .321 and, like the White Sox's Jackson, was in the top five of their respective leagues in most important hitting categories. Third baseman Heinie Groh was the other great hitter on the team at .310 with a .392 on-base percentage and 79 runs scored. Slick-fielding first baseman Jake Daubert, a two-time National League batting champion with Brooklyn earlier in the decade, also scored 79 runs and hit .276, while catcher Ivey Wingo hit .273. The rest of the team was unheralded, including second baseman Morrie Rath, a .264 hitter with no power but a good on-base percentage, and shortstop Larry Kopf, a .270 singles hitter. The corner outfielders were decidedly weaker hitters, with former Phillies star left fielder Sherry Magee's .215 in 56 games and right fielder Earle \"Greasy\" Neale's .242 with little power. This would prompt Moran to start rookie Pat Duncan in left field in the 1919 series.\nThe Reds' pitching was universally solid, however. The team's big three included Hod Eller (20–9, 2.39), Dutch Ruether (19–6, 1.82) and Slim Sallee (21–7, 2.06), all among the league leaders in various categories. They were backed by three other pitchers who were almost as successful: Jimmy Ring at only 10–9 but 2.26, Ray Fisher at 14–5 and 2.17 with five shutouts, and Cuban Dolf Luque at 10–3 and 2.63, former and future Giant who would win the last game of the 1933 World Series in long relief for New York. It was a deep and talented staff, a definite advantage in a World Series whose format had just been changed from best-of-seven to best-of-nine.\nThe fix.\nThe conspiring players on the White Sox got an unexpected assist when a flu-stricken Faber was left off the World Series roster. Indeed, years later, catcher Schalk said that had Faber been healthy, there never would have been a fix (since he almost certainly would have gotten starts that went to Cicotte or Williams). Despite their many wins on the field, the Sox were an unhappy team. Many observers blame their attitude on Comiskey's stinginess, despite the fact that the 1919 White Sox payroll was third highest in the AL, behind only Boston and New York.\nStories about the scandal have usually included Comiskey in its gallery of subsidiary villains, focusing in particular on his intentions regarding a clause in Cicotte's contract that would have paid the knuckleballer an additional $10,000 bonus for winning thirty games. According to Eliot Asinof's account of the events, \"Eight Men Out\", Cicotte was \"rested\" for the season's final two weeks after reaching his 29th win presumably to deny him the bonus, but the truth may be more complex. Cicotte won his 29th game on September 19, had an ineffective start on September 24 and was pulled after a few innings in a tuneup on the season's final day, September 28 (three days before the World Series opener). In addition, Cicotte reportedly agreed to the fix the same day he won his 29th game before he could have known of any efforts to deny him a chance to win his 30th. The story was probably true with regard to the 1917 season, however, when Cicotte won 28 games and hurled the White Sox to the championship.\nAlthough rumors were swirling among gamblers (according to Tom Meany in his chapter on the 1919 Reds in \"Baseball's Greatest Teams,\" \"Cincinnati money was pouring in\" even though the White Sox were regarded as the overwhelming favorite) and some of the press, most fans and observers were taking the Series at face value. On October 2, the day of Game 2, the \"Philadelphia Bulletin\" published a poem which would quickly prove to be ironic:\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe first game began at 3 pm at Cincinnati's Redland Field, with 30,511 fans in the stands and ticket scalpers outside the park raking in at least $50 per ticket. Chicago failed to score in the top of the first. In the bottom of the inning, Cicotte (who was paid his $10,000 the night before the series began) took the mound and hit the leadoff hitter, Morrie Rath, in the back with his second pitch, a prearranged signal to Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on. Even so, the game remained close for a while, due in part to some excellent defense from the conspirators, seeking to deflect suspicion from themselves. In the fourth, however, Cicotte \"went haywire\" (again according to Meany, \"op. cit.\"), allowing a number of hits in succession climaxed by a two-out triple to the opposing pitcher, as the Reds scored five times to break a 1–1 tie. Cicotte was relieved at that point, but the damage was done and the Reds went on to add three more runs in later innings and win 9–1.\nSportswriters thought that a bad throw by Cicotte to Risberg in the fourth inning, which prevented a possible double play, was suspicious. By that evening, there already were signs that things were going wrong. Only Cicotte, who had shrewdly demanded his $10,000 in advance, had been paid. \"Sleepy\" Bill Burns and Maharg met with Abe Attell, the former world boxing champ and Rothstein's intermediary, but he withheld the next installment ($20,000) nonetheless to bet on the next game. The next morning Gandil met Attell and again demanded money, but again to no avail.\nGame 2.\nAlthough they had not received their money, the players were still willing to go through with the fix. \"Lefty\" Williams, the starting pitcher in Game 2, was not going to be as obvious as Cicotte. After a shaky start, he pitched well until the fourth inning, when he walked three and gave up as many runs. After that he became virtually unhittable again, giving up only one more run; but lack of clutch hitting, with Gandil a particularly guilty party, led to a 4–2 White Sox loss. Attell was still in no mood to pay up afterwards, but Burns managed to get hold of $10,000 and gave it to Gandil, who distributed it among the conspirators. The teams headed northwest to Comiskey Park in Chicago for Game 3 the next day, with no days off for travel in this Series.\nGame 3.\nRookie pitcher Dickey Kerr, the Game 3 starter for the Sox, was not in on the fix. The original plan was for the conspirators, who disliked Kerr, to lose this game, but by now dissent among the players meant that the plan was in disarray. Burns still had faith and gathered the last of his resources to bet on Cincinnati. It was a decision that would leave him broke, as Chicago scored early—with Gandil himself driving in two runs—and Kerr was masterful, holding the Reds to three hits in a 3–0 complete game shutout.\nGame 4.\nCicotte took the mound again for Game 4, and was determined not to look as bad as he had in Game 1. For the first four innings, he and Reds pitcher Jimmy Ring matched zeroes. With one out in the fifth, Cicotte fielded a slow roller by Pat Duncan but threw wildly to first for a two-base error. The next man up, Larry Kopf, singled to left; Cicotte cut off the throw from Jackson and fumbled the ball, allowing Duncan to score. The home crowd was stunned by the veteran pitcher's obvious mistake. Cicotte then surrendered a double to Greasy Neale which scored Kopf to make it 2–0; this was enough of a lead for Ring, who hurled a three-hit shutout of his own, matching Kerr's in Game 3. The Reds led the Series 3–1.\nAfter the game \"Sport\" Sullivan came through with $20,000 for the players, which Gandil split equally among Risberg, Felsch, and Williams, who was due to start Game 5 the next day.\nGame 5.\nGame 5 was postponed by rain for a day. Both starters, Williams and Cincinnati's Hod Eller, pitched excellently at first, with neither allowing a runner past first until the top of the sixth, when Eller himself hit a blooper that fell between Felsch and Jackson. Felsch's throw was offline, sending Eller all the way to third. Leadoff hitter Morrie Rath then singled over the drawn-in infield, scoring Eller. Heinie Groh walked before Edd Roush's double—the result of more doubtful defense from Felsch—brought home two more runs, with Roush scoring shortly thereafter. Eller pitched well enough (he struck out nine batters, including a then-World Series record six in a row, since tied by Moe Drabowsky in the 1966 World Series opener) for the four runs to stand up, and the Reds were only one game away from their first world championship.\nGame 6.\nThe Series reverted to Cincinnati for Game 6. Dickey Kerr, starting for the White Sox, was less dominant than in Game 3. Aided by three White Sox errors, the Reds jumped out to a 4–0 lead before Chicago fought back, tying the game at 4-4 in the sixth, which remained the score into extra innings. In the top of the tenth, Gandil drove in Weaver to make it 5–4, and Kerr closed it out to record his — and Chicago's — second win.\nGame 7.\nDespite the rumors already circulating about Cicotte's erratic performances in Games 1 and 4, White Sox manager Kid Gleason showed faith in his ace for Game 7. This time, the knuckleballer did not let him down. Chicago scored early and, for once, it was Cincinnati that committed errors. The Reds threatened only briefly in the sixth before losing 4–1, and suddenly the Series was relatively close again. This marked the only time in World Series history that the winner of Game 7 did not ultimately go on to win the series.\nThis did not go unnoticed by Sullivan and Rothstein, who were suddenly worried. Before the Series started, the Sox had been strong favorites and few doubted they could win two games in a row—presuming that they were \"trying\" to win. Rothstein had been too smart to bet on individual games, but had $270,000 riding on Cincinnati to win the Series. The night before Game 8, Williams—the scheduled starter—was supposedly visited by an associate of Sullivan's known as Harry F who left no doubt that if he failed to blow the game in the first inning, he and his wife would be in serious danger.\nTo date, this is the only time the White Sox have ever played in a Game 7.\nGame 8.\nWhatever Williams had been told made its impression. In the first, throwing nothing but mediocre fastballs, he gave up four straight one-out hits for three runs before Gleason relieved him with \"Big\" Bill James, who allowed one of Williams' baserunners to score. James continued ineffective and, although the Sox rallied in the eighth, the Reds came away with a 10–5 victory for a five-games-to-three Series win. Jackson hit the only homer of the Series in the third inning after the Reds had built a 5–0 lead. Immediately after the Series ended, rumors were rife from coast to coast that the games had been thrown. Journalist Hugh Fullerton of the \"Chicago Herald and Examiner\", disgusted by the display of ineptitude with which the White Sox had \"thrown\" the series, wrote that no World Series should ever be played again.\nComposite line score.\n1919 World Series (5–3): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) over Chicago White Sox (A.L.)\nNotable performances.\nJackson led all players with his .375 average. Some believed that most of his offensive potency came in games that were not fixed and/or when the game seemed out of reach. He hit the Series' lone home run in the eighth and final game, a solo shot in the third inning, by which time the Reds were already ahead 5–0. His five hits with runners in scoring position came in: Game 6, sixth inning with Kerr pitching; Game 7, first and third innings; Game 8, two in the four-run eighth.\nShoeless Joe had 12 hits overall, a World Series record at that time."

        "text": "The 1930 World Series featured the defending World Series champion (and 1930 American League (AL) champion) Philadelphia Athletics against the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Athletics defeated the Cardinals in six games, 4–2. Philadelphia's pitching ace Lefty Grove, and George Earnshaw, the No. 2 man in Mack's rotation, won two games apiece. Earnshaw also pitched seven scoreless innings as Game 5 starter, but ended up with a no-decision as Grove relieved him in the eighth and took the win on Jimmie Foxx's two-run homer in the top of the ninth for the game's only scoring.\nThe Cardinals led the National League in runs scored and averaged six runs per game in the regular season, but could manage only two runs per game in this World Series.\nThis was the Athletics' fifth World Series championship win (following , , and ), and their last in Philadelphia before moving to Kansas City in 1955 and then Oakland in 1968—where they have since won four more World Series titles (, , , and ). Their win this year tied them with the Boston Red Sox for most World Series wins as of that point (five) until , when the New York Yankees surged ahead of both in World Series wins and have gone on to amass 27 World Series championships as of 2020.\nThe city of Philadelphia would have to wait 50 years until its next World Series championship, when the Phillies defeated the Kansas City Royals and thus became the last of the \"Original Sixteen\" MLB franchises to accomplish the feat.\nThis World Series also marks the beginning of the Cardinals run of dominance in the National League in the early 1930s. They would win the pennant three times between 1930 and 1934 and the World Series in 1931 and '34.\nThis would also be the final World Series where both teams uniforms did not have numbers.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe A's managed only five hits off of Grimes in Game 1, but all were for extra bases and each produced a run in five different innings. Al Simmons and Mickey Cochrane hit solo home runs for the A's, helping Lefty Grove to a 5–2 win. The A's struck first in the bottom of the second when Jimmie Foxx tripled and scored on Bing Miller's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals loaded the bases in the third on three straight leadoff singles, then Taylor Douthit's lineout and Sparky Adams's sacrifice fly scored a run each. Simmons's home run in the fourth tied the game. In the sixth, Max Bishop walked with one out and scored on Foxx's double. Next inning, Mule Haas tripled with one out and scored on Joe Boley's groundout. Cochrane's eighth inning home run gave the A's their last run of the game.\nGame 2.\nGeorge Earnshaw allowed six hits and walked one, putting the A's ahead 2–0. The Athletics scored six runs in the first four innings to put the game out of reach. Mickey Cochrane's two-out home run in the first gave the A's their first run. After Al Simmons singled, Jimmie Foxx's RBI double made it 2–0 A's. George Watkins's home run in the second gave the Cardinals their only run of the game. In the third, Cochrane reached on an error and scored on Simmons's double. After an intentional walk, Bing Miller's RBI single made it 4–1 A's. Philadelphia added two more runs next inning on Jimmy Dykes's double.\nGame 3.\nAfter the A's loaded the bases in the top of the first, Hallahan settled down and pitched a shutout. Philadelphia left a total of 11 men on base. The Cardinals scored the game's first run on Taylor Douthit's home run in the fourth, then next inning hit three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which by Charlie Gelbert scoring a run. In the seventh, Bill Shores allowed three consecutive leadoff singles, the last of which by Jimmie Wilson scoring two runs. Next inning, the Cardinals added another run off of Jack Quinn on back-to-back one-out doubles by Jim Bottomley and Chick Hafey.\nGame 4.\nAn error by Jimmy Dykes in the fourth inning allowed the Cardinals to score two runs. Haines did not allow a hit after the third inning. The A's got on the board in the first on Al Simmons's RBI single, but the Cardinals tied the game in the third when Charlie Gelbert tripled and scored on Jesse Haines's single. In the fourth, Chick Hafey hit a two-out ground rule double and scored on Dykes's error on Ray Blades's ground ball. Blades then scored on Gelbert's RBI single.\nGame 5.\nGeorge Earnshaw dueled Burleigh Grimes scoreless through seven innings before Lefty Grove took over for Earnshaw in the eighth. In the top of the ninth, Grimes walked Mickey Cochrane and then coughed up a home run ball to Jimmie Foxx. It must have been a patented Foxx blast, for Grimes said later, \"he hit it so hard I couldn't feel sorry for myself.\"\nGame 6.\nEarnshaw earned his second win on just one day of rest, pitching a five-hitter; it would be 88 years before another pitcher would start consecutive games in the postseason. Just like in Game 1, the A's seven hits came in five different innings, leading to two runs in the first and fourth innings, and single runs in the third, fifth, and sixth innings. As in Game 1, all the A's hits were extra-base hits, including home runs by Al Simmons and Jimmy Dykes.\nAlthough the A's hit only .197 (35–for–178) in the six game set, 18 of their hits went for extra bases, outscoring the Cardinals, 21–12. St. Louis only managed a .200 batting average in the series.\nThe A's struck first in the first on RBI doubles by Mickey Cochrane and Bing Miller, both after walks. Simmon's home run in the third off of Syl Johnson made it 3–0 A's, then Dykes's home run after a walk in the fourth increased their lead to 5–0. The A's added to their lead next inning when Jimmie Foxx hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a bunt groundout and scored on Mule Haas's sacrifice fly. the A's scored their last run of the game in the sixth off of Jim Lindsey on Cochrane's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals scored their only run of the game on Chick Hafey's RBI double in the ninth.\nComposite line score.\n1930 World Series (4–2): Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1931 World Series featured the two-time defending champion Philadelphia Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals beat the Athletics in seven games, a rematch and reversal of fortunes of the previous World Series.\nThe same two teams faced off during the 1930 World Series and the Athletics were victorious. The only day-to-day player in the Cardinals' lineup who was different in 1931 was the \"Wild Horse of the Osage\", Pepper Martin—a 27-year-old rookie who had spent seven seasons in the minor leagues. He led his team for the Series in runs scored, hits, doubles, runs batted in and stolen bases, and also made a running catch to stifle a ninth-inning rally by the A's in the final game.\nThe spitball pitch had been banned by Major League Baseball in 1920, but those still using it at that time were \"grandfathered\", or permitted to keep throwing it for the balance of their big-league careers. One of those who \"wet his pill\" still active in 1931 was Burleigh Grimes, with two Series starts, two wins and seven innings of no-hit pitching in Game 3. \"Wild\" Bill Hallahan started and won the other two for the Cards, and saved Game 7.\nThe Athletics had captured their third straight American League pennant, winning 107 games (and 313 from 1929–31). But this would prove to be the final World Series for longtime A's manager Connie Mack. As he did after the Boston \"Miracle Braves\" swept his heavily favored A's in the Series, Mack would break up this great team by selling off his best players, this time out of perceived economic necessity rather than pique and competition from the short-lived Federal League. It would be the A's last World Series appearance in Philadelphia and it would be 41 years—and two cities—later before the A's would return to the Fall Classic, after their successive moves to Kansas City in 1955 and Oakland in 1968. This would also be the city of Philadelphia's last appearance in the Series until 1950, and as of 2022 the only Series involving a Philadelphia team to last seven games. It was also the last World Series until the 2017 edition in which both teams who had won at least 100 games in the regular season went the maximum seven games.\nThis was the first World Series to feature a team with numbers on the back of the uniform (Philadelphia).\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe A's scored four runs in the third, enabling Lefty Grove to win Game 1 despite giving up 12 hits, three by Pepper Martin. The Cardinals struck first in the first inning on three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which to Jim Bottomley scoring a run. After a strikeout, Martin's double scored another run. In the top of the third with runners on first and second, Mule Haas's double scored Philadelphia's first run. Two consecutive walks by Paul Derringer loaded the bases and tied the game, then Jimmie Foxx's single scored two more runs. In the top of the seventh, Al Simmons's two-run home run put Philadelphia up 6–2, the game's final.\nGame 2.\nPepper Martin's two hits and two stolen bases, scoring both Cardinal runs, supported Hallahan's three-hit shutout. The Cardinals scored the game's first run in the second when Pepper Martin doubled off of George Earnshaw, stole third and scored on Jimmy Wilson's sacrifice fly, and the game's second run in the seventh when Martin hit a leadoff single, stole second, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Charlie Gelbert's fielder's choice.\nGame 3.\nGrimes pitched a two-hitter and contributed a two-run single in the fourth. He had a shutout until Al Simmons hit a two-run homer with two outs in the ninth. St. Louis struck first in the second when with runners on first and third via a walk and single, Jimmie Wilson's single and Charlie Gelbert's lineout scored a run each. They added to their lead in the fourth off of Lefty Grove on Burleigh Grimes's two-run single with runners on second and third, and added another run in the ninth off of Roy Mahaffey on Jim Bottomley's double.\nGame 4.\nGeorge Earnshaw pitched a brilliant two-hit shutout, walking one and striking out eight. Simmons RBI double in the first inning after a walk and two groundouts was all Earnshaw needed. Philadelphia added to their lead in the sixth off of Syl Johnson on Jimmie Foxx's home run and Jimmy Dykes's single after a Bing Miller double. Martin had both Cardinal hits.\nGame 5.\nMartin was a thorn in the A's side in the series, getting three hits and four RBI to lead St. Louis to a 5-1 victory. Through five games, Martin leads all regulars with a .667 (12-18) average. St. Louis struck first in the first on Pepper Martin's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. Martin's home run after a double in the sixth made it 3–0 Cardinals. The A's scored their only run in the seventh on Bing Miller's groundout after two one-out singles. The Cardinals added to their lead in the eighth when George Watkins walked off of Rube Walberg, stole second and scored on Martin's single and in the ninth off of Eddie Rommel on Charlie Gelbert's single with two on.\nGame 6.\nThe Athletics broke a scoreless tie with four runs in the fifth, Grove winning his second game of the series with a five-hitter, tying the series. After an error and walk off of Paul Derringer, Dib Williams's RBI single scored the game's first run. Two two-out walks loaded the bases and scored another run. Mickey Cochrane's RBI single scored a run, then a walk to Al Simmons scored another. St. Louis scored their only run in the sixth when Jake Flowers doubled and scored on Frankie Frisch's single. The A's added to their lead in the seventh off of Jim Lindsey. Max Bishop hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a bunt groundout, and scored on Al Simmons's single. After a single and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, a walk to Jimmy Dykes scored a run and an error scored two more.\nGame 7.\nThe Cardinals struck first in the first when with runners on second and third via two single and a bunt groundout, a wild pitch by George Earnshaw to Pepper Martin scored a run and a strike three wild pitch to Ernie Orsatti scored another. A two-run home run by George Watkins in the third gave the Cardinals a 4-0 lead, but the Athletics scored two in the ninth on Doc Cramer's bases loaded two-run single, Hallahan getting the last out, saving the victory for Grimes. Despite going 0–for–6 in Games 6 and 7, Pepper Martin was the leading hitter of the series with a .500 (12–for–24) batting average.\nComposite line score.\n1931 World Series (4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1932 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1932 season. The 29th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees versus the National League champions Chicago Cubs. The Yankees won in a four-game sweep. By far it is mostly noteworthy for Babe Ruth's \"called shot\" home run, in his 10th and last World Series. It was punctuated by fiery arguments between the two teams, heating up the atmosphere before the World Series even began. A record 13 future Hall of Famers played in this World Series, with three other future Hall of Famers also participating: umpire Bill Klem, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy, and Cubs manager Rogers Hornsby. It was also the first World Series in which both teams wore uniforms with numbers on the backs of the shirts.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Cubs opened the scoring with two runs in the top of the first inning with three singles, two by Woody English and Riggs Stephenson scoring a run each, but in the bottom of the third inning Earle Combs drew a leadoff walk off Guy Bush, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Babe Ruth's single before a two-run home run by Lou Gehrig put the Yankees up 3–2. In the sixth inning, they loaded the bases on three walks with one out before a two-run single by Bill Dickey and RBI fielder's choice by Ben Chapman knocked Bush out of the game. Burleigh Grimes in relief allowed two-out two-run single to Combs. The Cubs scored two in the seventh on Stephenson's two-run single, but in the bottom half, after a walk and single, Tony Lazzeri's RBI single, Chapman's sacrifice fly, and Grimes's wild pitch put the Yankees up 11–4. In the eighth, Gabby Hartnett hit a leadoff double and scored on Mark Koenig's triple. Billy Herman's groundout scored the Cubs' last run. The Yankees got one more run in the bottom half off Bob Smith when Combs doubled and scored on Joe Sewell's single. Yankee starter Red Ruffing pitched a complete game, striking out 10 Cubs but walking six and giving up six runs, only three of which were earned.\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, Chicago scored first in the top of the first on Riggs Stephenson's sacrifice fly with runners on first and third off Lefty Gomez, but in the bottom half, after two leadoff walks, RBI singles by Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey off Lon Warneke put the Yankees up 2–1. The Cubs tied the game in the third when Stephenson doubled with two outs and scored on Frank Demaree's single, but in the bottom half, Ben Chapman's two-run bases-loaded single put the Yankees ahead 4–2. They added another run in the fifth when Lou Gehrig hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Bill Dickey's single. Both pitchers pitched a complete game. This was the last World Series game Babe Ruth ever played in Yankee Stadium, with a single in his last Fall Classic home at-bat.\nGame 3.\nRoughly 50,000 Cubs fans showed up for Game 3, a very large crowd for the time made possible by the construction of temporary bleachers fronting Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. In a prelude of things to come, Ruth and Gehrig put on an impressive batting display in batting practice. Ruth launched nine balls into the outfield stands, while Gehrig hit seven. As reported in the first edition of \"A Day at the Park\", by William Hartel, p. 82, Ruth said while batting: \"I'd play for half my salary if I could bat in this dump all the time!\"\nCub starter Charlie Root struggled in the opening frame. The first two Yankees reached base on a walk and error, and Babe Ruth followed with a home run into the right-center-field bleachers to put the Yanks up 3–0. The existing newsreel footage showed Gehrig giving Ruth a friendly swat on the buttocks as Ruth crossed the plate. Before their part of the first inning was over, the Yankees got two, two-out singles, but they failed to score any further runs in the inning. In the bottom half, Billy Herman drew a leadoff walk off George Pipgras and scored on Kiki Cuyler's double.\nGehrig hit a home run in the top of the third to put the Yankees up 4–1. In the bottom half, Cuyler homered with one out, then after a single and forceout, Grimm's RBI double cut the Yankees lead to 4–3. Next inning, Billy Jurges doubled to left after Ruth's futile dive for the ball and scored on an error to tie the game.\nIn the top of the fifth, Ruth came up to bat and, after making a series of pointing gestures, eventually hit a home run to centerfield, giving the Yankees the lead and control of the rest of the World Series. The home run, deemed Babe Ruth's called shot, has since become arguably the most iconic home run in baseball history. Many believe Ruth's pointing gestures to have been his declaring he would hit a home run to a specific point in the stands, although evidence has suggested that he was actually pointing his finger tauntingly at the Cubs' dugout. \nRoot would only throw one more pitch, which Gehrig hit for a back-to-back home run, putting the Yankees up 6–4 and knocking Root out of the game. The Yankees got another run in the ninth aided by two errors on Champman's double off Jakie May. Though Gabby Hartnett hit a leadoff home run in the bottom half and Billy Jurges singled off Pipgras, Herb Pennock retired the next three batters to end the game and leave the Yankees one win away from the championship.\nGame 4.\nThe Yankees loaded the bases in the top of the first on two singles and a hit-by-pitch, but scored just once on Lou Gehrig's sacrifice fly. A walk loaded the bases, but Lon Warneke in relief of Guy Bush retired the next two batters to end the inning. In the bottom half, after two singles, Frank Demaree's three-run home run off Johnny Allen put the Cubs atop 3–1. After an error and single, Billy Jurges's RBI single knocked Allen out of the game. Wilcy Moore relieved him and put the fire out, giving up only one additional run in innings. Tony Lazzeri's two-out two-run home run in the third cut the Cubs' lead to 4–3. The Yankees took the lead in the sixth on a two-run single by Gehrig off Jakie May, but in the bottom half, two errors allowed the Cubs to tie the game. In the seventh, after loading the bases, three straight hits by Earle Combs, Joe Sewell and the Babe, the last World Series hits for Sewell and Ruth, put the Yankees up for good, 9–5. A hit-by-pitch reloaded the bases, but Bud Tinning retired two to end the inning. The Yankees blew the game open in the ninth off Burleigh Grimes, starting with a leadoff home run by Earle Combs, then after two outs, Gehrig walked before Lazzeri's second home run of the game made it 12–5 Yankees. They scored one more run when Bill Dickey singled and scored on Ben Chapman's double. In the bottom half, Herb Pennock allowed a leadoff single to Billy Herman who stole second and third on defensive indifferences and scored on Woody English's groundout before Pennock retired the next two hitters to end the series.\nThe Yankees had won their fourth World Series, and their 12th consecutive Series game. It was the last Series for Yankee mainstays Ruth, Combs and Pennock.\nThe Cubs extended their World Series victory drought to 24 years with their humiliating loss, their fourth consecutive in the Fall Classic after 1910, 1918 and 1929 (to the A's, Red Sox and A's again respectively). The Cubs' drought would end up lasting 108 years, having been finally ended when the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in seven games to win the 2016 World Series.\nDespite Ruth heroics, Gehrig was the real hero of the series batting .529 (he collected 9 hits out of 17 times at bat) with 8 RBIs and 3 home runs.\nComposite line score.\n1932 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)\nThe arguments.\nBench jockeying, called \"trash talk\" nowadays, was standard procedure in baseball then as now. No verbal punches were ever pulled, but the jockeying was supposedly taken to new heights (or depths) in this Series stemming from Yankee disrespect for the way the Cubs treated their former teammate, shortstop Mark Koenig, after his acquisition from the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A Mission Reds of the Pacific Coast League on April 25, 1932. Despite Koenig's regular-season contributions (hitting .353 and fielding well), his stingy Cub teammates voted him only half a player's postseason share before the start of the Series because he had only played in 33 games and was unable to play in the Series due to injury. When some of Koenig's Yankee friends got wind of this, they dissed the Cubs as \"cheapskates\" in the press, \"tight\" with their Series money.\nRuth infuriated the Cubs the most when he called them cheapskates. Adding spice to the verbal stew was that Yankee manager Joe McCarthy had been fired by the Cubs a year or two after leading them to the 1929 NL pennant. When the Series started in New York, the Cubs retaliated by calling the Babe \"fat\" and \"washed up\" along with every obscenity they could think of. Guy Bush, Cub starter in Game 1, led the verbal attack on Ruth, calling him \"nigger\" (a common bench-jockey slam against the Babe for his broad nose and thick lips despite his German origin), and banter like this went on for most of the Series.\nThe \"called shot\".\nBabe Ruth's called shot refers to the home run he hit in the fifth inning of Game 3. Existing film shows Ruth made a pointing gesture during this at-bat, but what this signified is ambiguous. Though neither fully confirmed nor refuted, the story goes that Ruth pointed to the center field bleachers, supposedly predicting he would hit a home run there. On the next pitch, he hit what was estimated as a nearly 500' \"Ruthian\" homer to deep center past the flagpole and into the temporary seating in the streets. A few reporters later wrote that Ruth had \"called his shot\" (like a pool shark), and thus the legend was born. Ruth, ever aware of his larger-than-life public image, was quick to confirm the story once he got wind of it. Conflicting testimony and inconclusive film footage have placed that moment high up in the realm of baseball legend."

        "text": "The 1933 World Series was the championship series of the 1933 Major League Baseball season. The 30th edition of the World Series, it matched the National League (NL) pennant winner New York Giants and the American League (AL) pennant winner Washington Senators. The Giants defeated the Senators in five games for their first championship since and their fourth overall. Key to the Giants' World Series triumph was the pitching of aces \"King\" Carl Hubbell and \"Prince\" Hal Schumacher.\nThis would be the last World Series played in Washington, D.C., until . The Giants next won the World Series in , their final title in New York City as the franchise moved to San Francisco after the season.\nBackground.\nNew York Giants majority owner John McGraw retired as manager in 1932 after 30 years at the helm, naming his protégé, young star first baseman Bill Terry, recently the last .400 hitter in the National League, as his player-manager successor. Somewhat similarly, former superstar hurler Walter Johnson also retired in 1932 as Washington Senators manager in favor of young star shortstop Joe Cronin as their new player-manager. (McGraw watched the Series from the stands, and died four months later.)\nThe Senators were the surprise team of 1933, breaking a seven-year monopoly on the AL title jointly held by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Athletics from 1926 to 1932. But this could also be called a joint 13-year monopoly by all three, since the Senators had also won in 1924 and 1925 and the Yankees won from 1921 to 1923. 43-year-old future Hall of Famer Sam Rice, in his last year with the Senators, had only one at bat during the series, picking up a pinch hit single in the second game.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nMel Ott had four hits and three RBI in Game 1, hitting a two-run home run in the first and RBI single in the third with two on, all off of Lefty Stewart. Travis Jackson scored the Giants' last run on a groundout off of Jack Russell. Carl Hubbell struck out ten, allowed two unearned runs (on groundouts by Joe Cronin in the fourth with two on and Joe Kuhel with the bases loaded in the ninth) and pitched a five-hitter.\nGame 2.\nThe Giants overcame a 1–0 deficit (as a result of Goose Goslin's third inning home run) with a six-run sixth inning. They loaded the bases with no outs on a single, double and intentional walk off of General Crowder before Lefty O'Doul hit a pinch-hit single that scored two runs. RBI singles by Travis Jackson, Gus Mancuso, Hal Schumacher and Jo-Jo Moore each scored a run. Hal Schumacher pitched a five-hitter for a 6–1 victory, giving New York a 2–0 lead.\nGame 3.\nThe Senators scored two runs in the first inning on Joe Cronin's RBI groundout with runners on second and third followed by Fred Schulte's RBI double. Next inning, Ossie Bluege hit a leadoff double and scored on Buddy Myer's double. They got one more run in the seventh when Luke Sewell singled, stole second, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Myer's double. Earl Whitehill held New York to five hits in the shutout. To date, this is the last World Series game in which a Washington team won at home.\nGame 4.\nCarl Hubbell went all eleven innings in the 2–1 win. He induced Cliff Bolton to ground out into a bases-loaded, game ending double play. Bill Terry's home run off of Monte Weaver put the Giants up 1–0 in the fourth, but the Senators tied the score in the seventh when Joe Kuhel reached on an error, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Luke Sewell's single. Travis Jackson singled to lead off the 11th, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored the game winning run on Blondy Ryan's single.\nGame 5.\nIn the second, Hal Schumacher's two-run single with runners on second and third put the Giants up 2–0 off of General Crowder. Kiddo Davis hit a leadoff double in the sixth and scored on Gus Mancuso's double to extend the lead to 3–0. Fred Schulte hit a game-tying three run homer in the sixth after two, two-out singles. for the Senators. Mel Ott's second home run of the series in the tenth off of Jack Russell won the Series for New York. Dolf Luque earned the win with 4 shutout innings of relief for Schumacher.\nComposite line score.\n1933 World Series (4–1): New York Giants (N.L.) beat Washington Senators (A.L.)\nAt the time, the winning margin of five runs was second-lowest for a five-game series (later equaled in 1942 and 1974); the 1915 margin was two runs, and three runs in 2000.\nAftermath.\nUntil winning the National League pennant in 2019, Washington, D.C., had not hosted another World Series game since 1933. In 2012, the Washington Nationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, brought postseason play back to Washington for the first time in 79 years but lost the National League Division Series (NLDS) after being one strike away from eliminating the St. Louis Cardinals after their early 6–0 lead had evaporated. In 2019, the Nationals won their first postseason series since their move—the Wild Card Game, NLDS, and NLCS—as their October stints in 2014, 2016, and 2017 had all ended in NLDS losses. (While in Montreal, the franchise made only one postseason appearance, winning the 1981 NLDS that was created due to that season's players' strike, then losing the 1981 NLCS.) The 2019 Nationals went on to win the World Series, which ended a 95-year championship drought for the city, dating back to the Senators' win in .\nThis first Washington Senators franchise became the Minnesota Twins during the 1960–61 offseason, and would not reach the World Series again until as the Twins—since then, they have won two World Series, in and . The second Washington Senators, inaugurated in 1961 to replace the first edition on its way to Minnesota, became the Texas Rangers in 1972, who were also defeated four games to one in their first World Series ever by the now San Francisco Giants in 2010, with both Series 77 years apart starting in the Giants' home park and the Giants losing only Game 3 on the road in each. The Rangers were then defeated again in by the St. Louis Cardinals, when they had two chances to win in Game 6 when they came within one strike of winning. On their third attempt in , they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, four games to one."

        "text": "The 1935 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1935 season. The 32nd edition of the World Series, it matched the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago Cubs. The Tigers won in six games for their first championship in five Series appearances, as they had lost in , , , and . This was the first championship ever won by a Detroit-based team.\nThe Tigers won despite losing the services of first baseman Hank Greenberg. In Game 2, Greenberg collided with Cubs catcher Gabby Hartnett and broke his wrist, sidelining him for the rest of the Series.\nThe Cubs had won 21 consecutive games in September (still a record ), eventually taking the National League pennant by four games over the defending World Series champions, the St. Louis Cardinals.\nIn Game 6, Tommy Bridges pitched a complete-game victory to win the Series for Detroit. With the score tied 3–3 in the top of the ninth inning, Bridges gave up a leadoff triple to Stan Hack, but retired the next three batters without the runner on third scoring. In the bottom of the ninth, Goose Goslin drove in the winning run with two outs. After the game, manager Mickey Cochrane said the following of Bridges' gutsy performance: \"A hundred and fifty pounds of courage. If there ever is a payoff on courage this little 150-pound pitcher is the greatest World Series hero.\"\nIn addition to Bridges, the Tigers had a hitting hero. Right fielder Pete Fox accumulated ten hits and an average of .385 for the Series. Fox hit safely in all six games.\nDetroit owner Frank Navin, then 64 years old, had been running the organization for 30 years and had seen four of his teams win American League pennants, only to lose four World Series. Six weeks after the Tigers finally won the World Series in October 1935, Navin suffered a heart attack while riding a horse and died.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nA pitching duel between Lon Warneke and Schoolboy Rowe, both of whom went the distance, was decided by its leadoff batter, Augie Galan, doubling, and scoring on an error by Rowe that allowed Billy Herman to reach and eventually score on a Gabby Hartnett single. Frank Demaree added a homer in the ninth inning for the visiting Cubs.\nGame 2.\nIn the bottom of the first, Jo-Jo White hit a leadoff single and scored on a double by Mickey Cochrane, who scored on Charlie Gehringer's single before Hank Greenberg's two-run home run knocked Cubs' starter Charlie Root out of the game. In the fourth, Roy Henshaw got two outs before letting the Tigers load the bases on a single, hit-by-pitch and walk. A wild pitch scored a run, then after a walk reloaded the bases, Gehringer's two-run single made it 7–0 Tigers. The Cubs got on the board in the fifth when Phil Cavarretta reached first on an error, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Billy Jurges's single. The Cubs got two more runs in the seventh on Billy Herman's single with runners on second and third, but the Tigers added a run in the bottom half on Pete Fox's RBI single off of Fabian Kowalik. Tommy Bridges pitched a complete game as the Tigers' 8–3 tied the series heading to Chicago.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, Frank Demaree's leadoff home run in the second off of Elden Auker put Chicago on the board. A one-out single and subsequent error put runners on first and third before Bill Lee's ground out made it 2–0 Cubs. They added a run in the fifth when Billy Jurges drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Augie Galan's single. The Tigers got on the board in the sixth when Goose Goslin singled off of Lee and scored on Pete Fox's triple. In the eighth, after a walk and double, Goslin's two-run single tied the game and knocked Lee out. Reliever Lon Warneke allowed two singles, the second of which to Billy Rogell scoring a run, then Fox stole home to make it 5–3 Tigers. Detroit brought back Game 1 starter Schoolboy Rowe in relief. He allowed three straight one-out singles in the ninth, the last of which to Ken O'Dea, before Augie Galan's sacrifice fly sent the game into extra innings, but Rowe nailed down the victory after Jo-Jo White's RBI single scored the winning run off of Larry French in the 11th. This game remarkably featured four ejections, two from each team. The Tigers lost Woody English and coach Del Baker. The Cubs lost Tuck Stainback and manager Charlie Grimm. Neither English nor Stainback were in the game.\nGame 4.\nAlvin \"General\" Crowder did it all for Detroit, pitching a complete-game five-hitter, allowing only one run on Gabby Hartnett's home run in the second, singling in the third and scoring his team's first run on Charlie Gehringer's RBI double, and getting Flea Clifton home as the go-ahead run with a groundout in the sixth off of Tex Carleton aided by two errors. Chicago threatened against Crowder with a pair of one-out hits in the ninth, but Stan Hack grounded into a game-ending 6-4-3 double play.\nGame 5.\nStaving off elimination, the Cubs got a two-run home run from Chuck Klein after a leadoff triple in the second. They added another run in the seventh on Billy Herman's RBI double off of Schoolboy Rowe. They replaced Lon Warneke after six innings with right-hander Bill Lee, who gave up Detroit's only run in the ninth on three consecutive singles (the last of which to Pete Fox before settling down to retire the final three batters.\nThis was the first of three World Series games that the Cubs have won in Wrigley Field (where they had previously lost 6 Series games). The other wins were Game 6 in 1945, and Game 5 in 2016.\nGame 6.\nIn Game 6, Pete Fox's RBI double off of Larry French put the Tigers on the board. Billy Herman's RBI single tied the game in the third off of Tommy Bridges, who put the Tigers back in front in the fourth with an RBI groundout with two on, but Herman's two-run home run in the fifth put the Cubs ahead 3–2. The Tigers tied the game in the sixth when Billy Rogell doubled with two outs and scored on Marv Owen's single. In the ninth, Mickey Cochrane singled and moved to second on a groundout before Goose Goslin's walk-off single won it in front of Detroit's home fans, pitcher Tommy Bridges getting his second win of the Series. Stan Hack tripled to lead off the top of the 9th for the Cubs, but was left stranded at third.\nComposite line score.\n1935 World Series (4–2): Detroit Tigers (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)\nDetroit: \"City of Champions\".\nWhen the Detroit Tigers won the 1935 World Series, the city of Detroit was mired in the Great Depression, which had hit the city and its industries particularly hard. However, with the success of the Tigers and other Detroit teams and athletes in 1935/36, Detroit's luck appeared to be changing, as the city was dubbed the \"City of Champions.\" The Lions continued Detroit's winning ways by capturing the 1935 NFL Championship Game, followed by the Detroit Red Wings winning the 1935–36 Stanley Cup championship. With the Stanley Cup win, the city had seen three major league championships in less than a year. Detroit's \"champions\" included Detroit's \"Brown Bomber\", Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing champion; native Detroiter Gar Wood who was the champion of unlimited powerboat racing and the first man to go 100 miles per hour on water; and Eddie \"the Midnight Express\" Tolan, a black Detroiter who won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter races at the 1932 Summer Olympics."

        "text": "The 1936 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1936 season. The 33rd edition of the World Series, it matched the New York Yankees against the New York Giants, with the Yankees winning in six games to earn their fifth championship.\nThe Yankees played their first World Series without Babe Ruth and their first with Joe DiMaggio, Ruth having been released by the Yankees after the 1934 season. He retired in 1935 as a member of the Boston Braves.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nCarl Hubbell won Game 1, allowing only one run on George Selkirk's home run and seven hits. After Dick Bartell's fifth inning home run off Red Ruffing tied the game, an RBI single by Gus Mancuso scoring Mel Ott, who doubled to lead off, in the sixth inning put the Giants up 2–1. They padded their lead in the eighth inning. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases before a walk to Burgess Whitehead and sacrifice fly by Travis Jackson scored a run each. Hubbell's two-run single capped the game's scoring. He pitched a perfect ninth as the Giants took a 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nThe Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds by an 18–4 count, setting Series records () for the biggest margin of victory in a World Series game (14 runs) and the most runs scored in one game with 18. They loaded the bases with no outs in the first off Hal Schumacher on two singles and a walk before sacrifice flies by Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey put them up 2–0. Two walks and a wild pitch by Lefty Gomez in the second inning allowed the Giants to cut the lead to 2–1, but the Yankees blew the game open in the third inning. A single, walk and error loaded the bases with no outs. Al Smith relieved Schumacher and allowed a two-run single to Gehrig and RBI single to Dickey. A one-out walk reloaded the bases before Tony Lazzeri's grand slam off Dick Coffman made it 9–1 Yankees. The Giants scored their last three runs in the fourth inning on a bases loaded walk to Dick Bartell followed by a two-run single by Bill Terry. The Yankees added a run in the sixth on Joe DiMaggio's sacrifice fly with two on off Frank Gabler, then loaded the bases in the seventh on a walk and two singles before Lazzeri's flyout and Gomez's groundout scored a run each. In the ninth, Jake Powell drew a leadoff walk off Harry Gumbert, stole second, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Gomez's single. After another single, back-to-back RBI singles by Red Rolfe and DiMaggio made it 15–4 Yankees. One out later, Dickey's three-run home run capped the scoring.\nDiMaggio made a tremendous play in Game 2. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Hank Leiber drove the ball deep into dead center, and Joe caught the ball running up the steps of the clubhouse. This remarkable catch was at least further than Willie Mays' far more celebrated catch of Vic Wertz's drive to deep straightaway center in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. After DiMaggio's game-ending grab, President Roosevelt, who was in attendance, saluted Joe for his great catch as he rode off in the presidential limousine. All three ninth-inning outs were made by DiMaggio.\nYankee second baseman Tony Lazzeri became only the second player ever to hit a grand slam home run in the World Series. Elmer Smith of the Cleveland Indians had been the sole achiever of that feat in World Series play, doing so in Game 5 of the 1920 World Series.\nAfter seeing the score of this game, legendary Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully (then 9 years old) became a Giants fan as he felt bad for the losing side. He credited this game as the game that made him fall in love with the game of baseball\nGame 3.\nHard luck-loser Freddie Fitzsimmons allowed only two hits over seven innings, one of them a tremendous home run by Gehrig in the second inning, but after the Giants tied the game in the fifth inning on Jimmy Ripple's home run off Bump Hadley, Frankie Crosetti's single with the count 0–2 and two outs scored Jake Powell with the decisive run in the eighth inning. Pat Malone pitched a scoreless ninth for the save.\nGame 4.\nThe Yankees struck first in the second when Jake Powell reached on an error and scored on George Selkirk's single off Carl Hubbell. Next inning, Frank Crosetti hit a leadoff double and scored on Red Rolfe's single, then Lou Gehrig's two-run home run gave the Yankees a 4–0 lead. Jimmy Ripple's RBI single in the fourth off Monte Pearson put the Giants on the board. Bill Terry's groundout with runners on first and third in the eighth cut the Yankees' lead to two, but they got that run back in the bottom half when Gehrig hit a leadoff double off Frank Gabler and scored on Powell's single. Pearson won his first World Series game (he won three more, in 1937, 1938, and 1939).\nGame 5.\nThe Giants struck first with back-to-back leadoff doubles by Jo-Jo Moore and Dick Bartell off Red Ruffing. RBI singles by Jimmy Ripple and Burgess Whitehead made it 3–0 Giants. George Selkirk's home run off Hal Schumacher in the second put the Yankees on the board. Next inning, with runners on second and third, an error on Frank Crosetti's groundball allowed another run to score. A similar situation in the sixth on Burgess Whitehead's groundball allowed the Giants to pad their lead to 4–2, but in the bottom half, three consecutive two-out singles allowed the Yankees to tie the game. Bill Terry's sacrifice fly in the top of the tenth inning off Pat Malone, scoring Jo-Jo Moore, who doubled to leadoff and moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, helped the Giants win Game 5, 5–4, to extend the series to a Game Six.\nGame 6.\nThe Giants loaded the bases in the first off Lefty Gomez on a single and two walks before Mel Ott drove in two with a double, but Jake Powell's home-run after a two-out triple off Freddie Fitzsimmons tied the game in the second. Next inning, Lou Gehrig's sacrifice fly after two one-out singles put the Yankees up 3–2. They extended their lead to 5–2 in the fourth on four singles, two of which (by Gomez and Red Rolfe) scored a run each. Ott's home run in the fifth cut the lead to 5–3, then in the seventh, Dick Bartell hit a leadoff double and scored on Bill Terry's single to make it a one-run game. Tony Lazzeri's RBI single in the eighth off Slick Castleman made it 6–4 Yankees, but the Giants again cut the lead to one on Jo-Jo Moore's home run in the bottom half off Johnny Murphy. The Yankees, though, blew it open in the ninth. After two leadoff singles off Dick Coffman, an error on Bill Dickey's fielder's choice allowed one run to score. A walk loaded the bases before Powell drove in two more runs for the Yankees with a single. Harry Gumbert relieved Coffman and after a walk loaded the bases, Murphy's single, Crosetti's walk, Rolfe's groundout, and Joe DiMaggio's single scored a run each to make it 13–5 Yankees. It was the first time in history that a team would score seven runs in the 9th inning of a postseason game. No team has surpassed this mark, although five have tied it (the next one to occur after this one took place 34 years later). Murphy retired the Giants in order in the bottom of the ninth to give the Yankees the championship.\nComposite line score.\n1936 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)\nAftermath.\nThe Yankees' fifth championship tied the record at that time, which was shared by the Boston Red Sox and the Philadelphia Athletics, who also had five World Series titles. The Yankees also tied the American League record at that time for the most World Series appearances with eight, also shared with the Athletics. They broke both records the following year. The Giants appeared in their 11th World Series, extending the record they already held at that time, and their seventh World Series defeat also extended the record they already owned.\nDiMaggio would go on to be the only person to play on four World Championship teams in his first four years in the big leagues, the 1936–39 Yankees.\nThe Yankee left fielder Jake Powell started the year with the Washington Senators before coming over in the middle of the year in a trade for Ben Chapman. In this Series, the unheralded Powell would lead all hitters in hits (10), batting average (.455), runs (8) and walks (4), add a home run with five runs batted in, and grab the Yankees' only stolen base. However, it proved to be a fleeting moment of fame for the troubled ballplayer, who gambled away the World Series check not long after before fizzling out with the Yankees by 1940, amidst controversial remarks involving him beating people as a cop to train in the offseason. He died in 1948 at the age of 40 after shooting himself in a police station for passing bad checks."

        "text": "The 1937 World Series featured the defending champion New York Yankees and the New York Giants in a rematch of the 1936 Series. The Yankees won in five games, for their second championship in a row and their sixth in 15 years (1923, 1927–28, 1932, 1936).\nThis was the Yankees' third Series win over the Giants (1923, 1936), finally giving them an overall edge in Series wins over the Giants with three Fall Classic wins to the Giants' two (after they lost the and 1922 Series to the Giants). Currently (), the St. Louis Cardinals are the only \"Classic Eight\" National League (1900–1961) team to hold a Series edge over the Bronx Bombers, with three wins to the Yankees' two. The 1937 victory by the Yankees also broke a three-way tie among themselves, the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox for the most World Series wins all-time (five each). By the time the Athletics and Red Sox each won their sixth World Series (in 1972 and 2004, respectively), the Yankees had far outpaced both teams in world championships with 20 in 1972 and 26 in 2004.\nThe 1937 Series was the first in which a team (in this case, the Yankees) did not commit a single error, handling 179 total chances (132 putouts, 47 assists) perfectly. Game 4 ended with the final World Series innings ever pitched by Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell, who during the ninth inning gave up Hall of Famer Lou Gehrig's final Series home run.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Series opener was a battle of aces, as the Giants sent their \"Mealticket\", screwballer Carl Hubbell, who had won 22 games during the season, to the mound against the Bombers' Lefty Gomez, who had won 21. Hubbell and Gomez matched zeroes until the top of the fifth inning, when Jimmy Ripple singled, moved to third on another single by Johnny McCarthy, and scored the only Giant run of the game when Gus Mancuso hit into a double play.\nHubbell kept the Yankees at bay in the bottom half of the inning, but the wheels came off for him in the sixth. A walk and two singles loaded the bases with one out before Joe DiMaggio's two-run single put the Yankees up 2–1. An intentional walk reloaded the bases before Bill Dickey's RBI single increased the lead to 3-1, then George Selkirk's two-run single following a force out at home chased King Carl. An error on Tony Lazzeri's ground ball made it 6–1 Yankees, then Giant pitcher Dick Coffman issued two walks, including one to Red Rolfe that forced in a run before DiMaggio flew out to end the inning. Tony Lazzeri added a home run in the eighth inning off Al Smith, while Gomez stymied the Giants, holding them to one run and six hits in a complete game, 8–1 victory for a 1–0 Yankee lead in the Series.\nGame 2.\nFor Game 2, the Yankees started veteran Red Ruffing against Giant rookie Cliff Melton. Ruffing would give Melton a rude welcome to postseason play with both his arm and his bat.\nThe Giants touched Ruffing for a run in the first, as Dick Bartell doubled and Mel Ott drove him in with a single with one out. This did not faze Ruffing, who whiffed the next three batters to end the inning. As in Game 1, this would be the only Giant run of the day. Melton was able to neutralize the potent Bombers for the next four innings, giving up only two hits and striking out two. In the fifth, however, the Yankees chased the youngster from the game when they took a 2–1 lead on a leadoff double by Myril Hoag, then RBI singles by George Selkirk and Ruffing.\nJust as in Game 1, the pinstripers opened up the game in the sixth, when Selkirk and Ruffing came through again, this time with two-run doubles after two leadoff singles off of Harry Gumbert. In the seventh, the Yankees tacked on two more runs off of Dick Coffman with leadoff single and walk, followed by a Bill Dickey single that scored Joe DiMaggio and a fly ball by Myril Hoag that plated Lou Gehrig. Ruffing held the fort the rest of the way, scattering seven hits with one run and eight strikeouts. For the second straight game the Yankees won 8–1, for a 2–0 Series lead as the teams moved a few miles south to the Polo Grounds.\nGame 3.\nThe Yankees struck first in Game 3 on Tony Lazzeri's RBI single with two on in the second off of Hal Schumacher. Next inning, Lou Gehrig hit a one out single, and scored on a triple by Bill Dickey, who then scored on a single by George Selkirk. Gehrig added a sacrifice fly next inning with runners on first and third. The Yankees got one more run in the fifth when Selkirk reached second on an error and scored on Myril Hoag's single. The Giants scored their only run in the seventh when Jimmy Ripple singled with one out and scored on Johnny McCarthy's double. Monte Pearson needed last-out help from Johnny Murphy after loading the bases in the bottom of the ninth, inducing Harry Danning, the tying run at the plate, to fly out to centerfield. The Yankees now had a 3–0 lead in the series.\nGame 4.\nThis is the second time in World Series history that a team that has lost the first three games has won a World Series game. This was Carl Hubbell's last World Series appearance. Hubbell allowed only six hits and walked one. Everyone in the NY Giants lineup except Hubbell hit safely. The Yankees scored the game's first run in the first when Red Rolfe hit a leadoff triple and scored on Joe DiMaggio's sacrifice fly, but in the bottom of the second, three consecutive leadoff singles tied the game. Carl Hubbell's fielder's choice and Jo-Jo Moore's single scored a run each. Ivy Andrews relieved Bump Hadley and allowed an RBI single to Dick Bartell. A two-out walk loaded the bases before Hank Leiber's two-run single capped the inning's scoring. The Yankees scored a run in the third without a hit aided by three errors. The Giants added a run in the seventh on Harry Danning's RBI double with two on. Lou Gehrig homered in the ninth for the Yankees, who could get nothing else as the Giants' 7–3 win forced a Game 5.\nGame 5.\nMyril Hoag's home run leading off the second inning and a Joe DiMaggio blast in the third gave Lefty Gomez a 2–0 lead. Mel Ott's two-run home run in the bottom of the third tied it. The Yankees got the game-winning (and Series-winning) runs they needed in the fifth on a Tony Lazzeri triple, an RBI single by Gomez and an RBI double by Lou Gehrig.\nComposite line score.\n1937 World Series (4–1): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)"

        "title": "1939 World Series",
        "text": "The 1939 World Series featured the three-time defending champion New York Yankees against the Cincinnati Reds, who were making their first Series appearance since winning the scandal-tainted 1919 World Series. The Yankees swept the Series in four games for the second straight year, winning their record fourth consecutive title (they would later win five straight from 1949 to 1953). Yankee manager Joe McCarthy won his fifth title, tying the record held by Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack.\nIn the 10th inning of the final game, a famous play at the plate typified the Series. \"King Kong\" Charlie Keller scored when he and the ball both collided with catcher \"Schnoz\" Ernie Lombardi, and then Joe DiMaggio also scored while Lombardi, rolling on the ground, tried in vain to retrieve the ball. Lombardi had been smacked in the groin, but the puritanical press reported it as Lombardi \"napping\" at the plate.\nThe Yankees matched the Reds in hits with 27, but out-homered them 7–0 and out-scored them 20–8. Keller led the Yanks with seven hits, three home runs, six RBI, eight runs scored, a .438 average and a 1.188 slugging percentage. Both teams played sterling defense for most of the series until the ninth inning of Game 4. Up until then the Reds matched the Yankees with committing just one error for the series. But Cincinnati committed a total of three errors in the ninth and 10th innings of Game 4 which led to five unearned runs, sealing the New York sweep.\nKeller broke the record for most homers by a rookie in a World Series game with two in Game 3. Also in Game 3, Junior Thompson gave up five hits in innings worked. Four of the five were home runs, tying the record for long balls allowed during a Series game set by the Cubs' Charlie Root in 1932.\nDespite the loss, the Reds were an organization on the rise, having improved from eighth and last in the National League in 1937 (56–98, .364) to fourth in '38 (82–68, .547) and first as NL champions in '39. Ironically, despite being dominated by the Bronx Bombers in the 1939 Series, the Reds would return in 1940 to win the World Series while the Yankees finished behind Detroit and Cleveland in the AL pennant race, snapping their consecutive World Series streak at four.\nThe Yankees and Reds would not meet again in the World Series until 1961 — a 5-game Yankees win. The two teams would meet again in 1976, with the Reds winning in a 4-game sweep.\nAt a cumulative time of seven hours and five minutes, the 1939 World Series is one of the shortest World Series in real time, and was shorter than the third game of the 2018 World Series that lasted 7 hours, 20 minutes and was 18 innings long.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn the opener, starters Red Ruffing and Paul Derringer pitched complete games. The Reds struck first in the fourth inning when Ival Goodman walked with two outs and scored on Frank McCormick's single, but the Yankees tied the game in the fifth inning Joe Gordon singled and scored on Babe Dahlgren's double. In the bottom of the ninth inning with one out and the score tied 1–1, Charlie Keller tripled. The Reds walked Joe DiMaggio, but Bill Dickey ended it with a walk-off single to center.\nGame 2.\nLasting just 87 minutes, both pitchers threw complete games, Monte Pearson winning it with a two-hitter. In the bottom of the third inning Babe Dahlgren hit a leadoff double and scored on two groundouts. Red Rolfe then singled and scored on Charlie Keller's double. After another single, Bill Dickey's RBI single made it 3–0 Yankees. They added another run in the fourth inning on Dalgren's home run and took a 2–0 series lead heading to Cincinnati.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, Charlie Keller's two-run home run the first off of Gene \"Junior\" Thompson put the Yankees up 2–0. In the bottom half, three consecutive two-out singles, the last an RBI one by Ernie Lombardi, cut the lead to 2–1. Yankees' starter Lefty Gomez left after that inning. In the second, Bump Hadley allowed four singles, the last two of which to Billy Werber and Ival Goodman scoring a run each, but in the third, Joe DiMaggio's two-run home run after a two-out walk to Keller put the Yankees back in front 4–3. They added to their lead in the fifth on Keller's two-run home run and Bill Dickey's home run to knock Thompson out of the game. Their 7–3 win left them one win away from the championship.\nGame 4.\nNeither side scored until the seventh. Home runs by Charlie Keller and Bill Dickey off of starter Paul Derringer put the Yankees on the board, but the Reds struck back in their half of the inning. With runners on second and third via an error and double off of reliever Steve Sundra, Wally Berger's RBI groundout put the Reds on the board, then after a walk, back-to-back RBI singles by Willard Hershberger and Billy Werber put the Reds up 3–2. They added another run next inning when Ival Goodman hit a leadoff double off of Johnny Murphy and scored on Ernie Lombardi's single, but in the ninth after two leadoff singles off of Bucky Walters, Dickey's fielder's choice aided by an error scored a run, then one out later, Joe Gordon's RBI single tied the game. Next inning, with two on via a walk and error, Joe DiMaggio drove them both in with a single and another error allowed DiMaggio himself to score to put the Yankees up 7–4. In the bottom half, Murphy allowed two leadoff singles, but retired the next three batters to end the game and series.\nComposite line score.\n1939 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Cincinnati Reds (N.L.)"

        "text": "The 1940 World Series matched the Cincinnati Reds against the Detroit Tigers, with the Reds winning a closely contested seven-game series. The victory secured the Reds the second championship in their franchise history and came 21 years after their victory over the scandal-tainted Chicago White Sox in . This would be the Reds' last World Series championship for 35 years despite appearances in , , and . Meanwhile, Bill Klem worked the last of his record 18 World Series as an umpire.\nOther story lines marked this series. Henry Quillen Buffkin Newsom, the father of Detroit's star pitcher Bobo Newsom, died in a Cincinnati hotel room the day after watching him win Game 1. Newsom came back to hurl a shutout in Game 5 in his memory. Called on to start a third time after a single day of rest by Tiger manager Del Baker, he pitched well in Game 7 until the seventh inning, when the Reds scored two runs to take the lead and eventually the game and the Series.\nThe Reds' star pitchers Paul Derringer and Bucky Walters won two games apiece, with Derringer winning the decisive seventh game. Walters hurled two complete games, allowing only eight hits and three runs combined. He also hit a home run in Game 6 in the midst of his 4–0 shutout, which sent the Series to a Game 7.\nIt was redemption of sorts for the Reds, who returned to the World Series after being swept by the Yankees squad in 1939. The Reds' win in Game 2 against Detroit snapped a 10-game losing streak for the National League in the Series going back to Game 5 in 1937.\nThe victory culminated a somewhat turbulent season for the Reds, who played large stretches of the season without injured All-Star catcher Ernie Lombardi. And on August 3, Lombardi's backup, Willard Hershberger, committed suicide in Boston a day after a defensive lapse cost the Reds a game against the Bees. Hershberger was hitting .309 at the time of his death. The Reds dedicated the rest of the season to \"Hershie.\" One of the stars in the World Series was 40-year-old Jimmie Wilson. Wilson had been one of the Reds' coaches before Hershberger's suicide forced him back onto the playing field as Lombardi's backup. With Lombardi hurting, Wilson did the bulk of the catching against Detroit and hit .353 for the Series and recorded the team's only stolen base.\nReds' manager Bill McKechnie became the first manager to win a World Series with two different teams, at the helm of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1925, after trailing three games to one against Walter Johnson and the Washington Senators.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nBobo Newsom won Game 1 aided by a five-run second inning by Detroit. Two singles and an error loaded the bases before Pinky Higgins drove in two runs with a single. A walk reloaded the bases before Dick Bartell's two-run single. Bruce Campbell's RBI single knocked starter Paul Derringer out of the game. The Reds got on the board in the fourth when Ival Goodman hit a leadoff double and scored on Jimmy Ripple's single, but Campbell's two-run home run in the fifth off of Whitey Moore extended the Tigers' lead to 7–1. The Reds got another run in the eighth when Billy Werber doubled and scored on Goodman's single, but nothing else as Detroit took a 1–0 series lead.\nThe Tigers' win in Game 1 was the first World Series game won by a non-New York City team since 1935. In every World Series between 1935 and 1940, either both teams were from New York City or a New York City team won in a sweep (1938 and 1939).\nGame 2.\nDetroit struck first in Game 2 Bucky Walters allowed two leadoff walks in the first, then an RBI single to Charlie Gehringer and ground-ball RBI double-play to Hank Greenberg, but the Reds tied it in the second on four singles off of Schoolboy Rowe, two of which by Eddie Joost and Billy Myers scoring a run each. Next inning, Jimmy Ripple's two-run home run put the Reds up 4–2. Back-to-back doubles by Walters and Billy Werber made it 5–2 Reds in the fourth. The Tigers got a run in the sixth on Hank Greenberg's RBI double after a walk and forceout in the sixth, but nothing else besides Pinky Higgins's leadoff double in the fifth as the Reds tied the series with a 5–3 win heading to Detroit.\nGame 3.\nThe Reds struck first in Game 3 when Billy Werber doubled to lead off the first off of Tommy Bridges and scored on Ival Goodman's single, but the Tigers tied it in the fourth on Hank Greenberg's double-play after back-to-back leadoff singles off of Jim Turner. Detroit went up 5–1 in the seventh on two-run home runs by Rudy York and Pinky Higgins. The Reds got a run in the eighth on Mike McCormick's RBI single with two on, but in the bottom half, Greenberg hit a leadoff triple off of Joe Beggs before Bruce Campbell's RBI single and Higgins's RBI double made it 7–2 Tigers. In the ninth after a leadoff single and error, RBI singles by Eddie Joost and Werber made it 7–4 Tigers, but Bridges struck out McCormick to end the game as Detroit took a 2–1 series lead.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, after a leadoff walk off of Dizzy Trout, Ival Goodman's RBI double and Pinky Higgins's error on Jimmy Ripple's ground ball made it 2–0 Reds in the first. They made it 3–0 in the third on Jimmy Ripple's RBI double after two leadoff singles. The Tigers got on the board in the bottom half when Paul Derringer walked Barney McCosky, who moved to second on a groundout and scored on Hank Greenberg's RBI double, but the Reds got back that run in the fourth on Ival Goodman's sacrifice fly off of Clay Smith after a leadoff walk and double. The Tigers got another run in the sixth Bruce Campbell singled with two outs and scored on Higgins's triple, but the Reds again got the run back in the eighth when Billy Werber singled with two outs off of Archie McKain, moved to second on a wild pitch and scored on Mike McCormick's RBI single. Derringer pitched a complete game to give the Reds a 5–2 win, tying the series 2–2.\nGame 5.\nBobo Newsom allowed only three singles and two walks in the shutout, the day after his father died. Detroit got on the board on Hank Greenberg's three-run home run after two leadoff singles in the third. Next inning, Billy Sullivan drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Dick Bartell's double. Two walks by starter Junior Thompson and reliever Whitey Moore loaded the bases before Hank Greenberg's sacrifice fly and after another walk, Bruce Campbell's two-run single made it 7–0 Tigers. They got another run in the eighth on Johnny Hutchings's wild pitch with two on and were just one win way from the championship heading back to Cincinnati.\nGame 6.\nBucky Walters drew the Reds even with a five-hit shutout. He helped his own cause with an RBI fielder's choice in the sixth with the bases loaded off of Johnny Gorsica and a solo home run in the eighth off of Fred Hutchinson. Schoolboy Rowe was knocked out after just of an inning, allowing four hits, including RBI singles to Ival Goodman and Jimmy Ripple. The Reds' 4–0 win forced a final Game 7.\nGame 7.\nGame 7 was over in 1 hour, 47 minutes. Detroit and pitcher Bobo Newsom clung to a 1-0 lead, courtesy of Charlie Gehringer's third inning RBI single off of Paul Derringer, until the seventh. Leadoff doubles by Frank McCormick and Jimmy Ripple tied the score, followed by a sacrifice bunt and Billy Myers' sacrifice fly for the game-winning (and Series-winning) run.\nComposite line score.\n1940 World Series (4–3): Cincinnati Reds (NL) over Detroit Tigers (AL)\nHome runs by pitchers.\nBucky Walters, converted to pitching only after a torn cartilage (not repairable in those days) had slowed him down as a runner, was the fourth National League pitcher to hit a home run during a World Series game.

        "title": "1944 World Series",
        "text": "The 1944 World Series was an all-St. Louis World Series, matching the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns at Sportsman's Park. It marked the third time in World Series history in which both teams had the same home field (the others being the and Series, both played at the Polo Grounds in New York City). It would be 76 years before another World Series had all of its games played in a single ballpark: the Series used Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas as a neutral site due to health concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\n1944 saw perhaps the nadir of 20th-century baseball, as the long-moribund St. Louis Browns won their only American League pennant. Some of the players were 4-Fs, rejected by the military for physical defects (such as one armed Pete Gray) or limitations that precluded duty. Others divided their time between factory work in defense industries and baseball, some being able to play ball only on weekends. Some players avoided the draft by chance, despite being physically able to serve. Stan Musial of the Cardinals was one. Musial, enlisting in early 1945, missed one season. He rejoined the Cardinals in 1946.\nAs both teams called Sportsman's Park home, the traditional 2–3–2 home field assignment was used (instead of the wartime 3–4). The Junior World Series of that same year, partly hosted in Baltimore's converted football stadium, easily outdrew the \"real\" Series and attracted attention to Baltimore as a potential major league city. Ten years later, the Browns transferred there and became the Orioles. The Orioles would go on to win the 1966 World Series, and become the last of the AL's eight charter franchises to do so. Another all-Missouri World Series was played 41 years later, with the Kansas City Royals defeating the Cardinals in seven games.\nThe Series was also known as the \"Trolley Series,\" \"Streetcar Series,\" or the \"St. Louis Showdown.\" Coincidentally, this World Series was played the same year Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the musical film \"Meet Me in St. Louis\". It remains one of two World Series played that featured two teams from the same city other than New York; the other was the 1906 World Series between the two Chicago teams. The 1989 World Series featured two teams from the San Francisco metropolitan area, but not the same city. It was also the first World Series in which both teams played west of the Mississippi River.\nThis is the only World Series to date in which neither team was credited with a stolen base.\nBackground.\nMany of the game's best players were called away for World War II, and the result was a seriously depleted pool of talent. The top team in the American League was the St. Louis Browns, who collectively batted .252 en route to their only pennant in 52 seasons. They only had one .300 hitter in outfielder Mike Kreevich (who barely made it at .301), one man with 20 home runs, shortstop Vern Stephens (who hit exactly 20), and one player over the 85 runs batted in mark, Stephens, who knocked in 109 to lead the league. On the mound, the Browns boasted Nels Potter and Jack Kramer, who combined for 36 victories. The team squeaked into first place by winning 11 out of their final 12 games, including the last 4 in a row over the defending champion New York Yankees. The last victory, combined with Detroit's loss to Washington, enabled St. Louis to finish one game ahead of the Tigers in the American League. Their 89–65 record would be the worst for an AL champion until the Minnesota Twins won the pennant in 1987 with a record of 85–77.\nOn the other side of Sportsman's Park, the other Major League team from St. Louis was doing business as usual. In making off with their third straight National League pennant (leading by games over Pittsburgh), manager Billy Southworth's Cardinals had won 105 games and ran their three-year victory total to 316. The Cardinals were the first National League franchise with three consecutive 100 win seasons. The 1944 club featured league MVP Marty Marion and future Hall of Famer Stan Musial.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nGeorge McQuinn hit the Browns' only home run of the series to put his team ahead in the fourth inning, while Denny Galehouse outpitched World Series veteran Mort Cooper to hold on for the win.\nGame 2.\nBlix Donnelly came in as a relief pitcher in the eighth inning, and tallied no runs, two hits and seven strikeouts for the win. Ken O'Dea's pinch-hit single in the 11th scored the winning run.\nGame 3.\nJack Kramer struck out ten batters on the way to a 6–2 Browns triumph, the last World Series game the team would win until the 1966 World Series, as the Baltimore Orioles.\nGame 4.\nBrowns starter Sig Jakucki had been away from baseball for five years, but returned to win 13 games in 1944. He lasted only three innings giving up four runs. Stan Musial hit a two-run homer in the first, and the Browns never recovered. Harry Brecheen went the distance for the win despite giving up nine hits and four walks.\nGame 5.\nMort Cooper recovered from his opening game loss to beat Galehouse with a seven-hit, 2–0 shutout. In the Cardinals' 1942–1944 stranglehold on the National League championship, Cooper had won 65 games and thrown 23 shutouts.\nGame 6.\nFor Game 6, it was Max Lanier and Ted Wilks (who both had 17 wins and shared a 2.65 ERA) that wrote the final chapter to the Browns' \"Cinderella season\" with a 3–1 victory that wrapped up the Cardinals' second Series title in three years. Ted Wilks was brilliant in relief, retiring all 11 Browns he faced, clinching the Cardinals' fifth World Series title.\nComposite line score.\n1944 World Series (4–2): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over St. Louis Browns (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1947 World Series matched the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Yankees won the Series in seven games for their 11th World Series championship in team history. Yankees manager Bucky Harris won the Series for the first time since managing the Washington Senators to their only title in , a gap of 23 years, the longest between World Series appearances in history. \nIn 1947, Jackie Robinson, a Brooklyn Dodger, desegregated major league baseball. For the first time in World Series history, a racially integrated team played.\nThis was the first World Series televised. However, TV broadcasting was still in its infancy, and thus the series was only seen in four markets via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City; Philadelphia; Schenectady/Albany, New York; Washington, D.C.. Outside of New York, coverage was pooled. The stations in those markets affiliated with NBC televised games 1 and 5; the DuMont stations had games 2, 6, and 7, and those affiliated with CBS broadcast games 3 and 4.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThere was an announced crowd of 73,365 in Yankee Stadium for Game 1. Brooklyn struck first in the first inning on Dixie Walker's RBI single off Spec Shea to score Pete Reiser from second base, but starter Ralph Branca was knocked out in a five-run fifth. A single, walk and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before Johnny Lindell's two-run double put the Yankees up 2–1. After a walk re-loaded the bases, another walk forced in a run, then after a groundout, Tommy Henrich's RBI single to left off Hank Behrman capped the inning's scoring. The Dodgers chipped away at the Yankees lead, getting a run in the sixth on Carl Furillo's RBI single off Joe Page and another in the seventh on Page's wild pitch with Pee Wee Reese at second, but Page held the Dodgers scoreless afterward as the Yankees took a 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nThe Yankees struck first in Game 2 on Johnny Lindell's double-play ground ball after two leadoff singles in the first off Vic Lombardi, scoring Snuffy Stirnweiss, but the Dodgers tied the game in the third on Jackie Robinson's RBI single. The Yankees regained the lead in the bottom half of the inning on Lindell's RBI triple with a runner at third, but the Dodgers again tied the game in the fourth on Dixie Walker's home run. In the bottom half of the fourth, after a leadoff triple, Phil Rizzuto's RBI double put the Yankees back in front 3–2. In the next inning, Tommy Henrich's lead-off home run extended their lead to 4–2. After a ground-rule double knocked Lombardi out of the game, George McQuinn's RBI single off Hal Gregg made it 5–2 Yankees. The Yankees added another run in the sixth on Lindell's sacrifice fly before breaking it open in the seventh. After a leadoff single and wild pitch by Hank Behrman, Billy Johnson's RBI single made it 7–2 Yankees. After a pop out and intentional walk, Reynolds's RBI single made it 8–2 Yankees. Rex Barney relieved Behrman and allowed an RBI single to Snuffy Stirnweiss and threw a wild pitch that turned the Yanks' advantage to 10–2. The Dodgers scored one more run in the ninth on Spider Jorgensen's groundout off Allie Reynolds, who scattered nine hits in a complete-game win.\nGame 3.\nThe series shifted to Ebbets Field. In the second inning the Dodgers rang up six runs. After a one-out walk, Bruce Edwards's double and Pee Wee Reese's single scored a run each. One out later, after a single and passed ball, Eddie Stanky's two-run double was the end for Yankee starter Bobo Newsom, but the runs kept coming with a Carl Furillo two-run double after a single off Vic Raschi. The rest of the day, the Yankees pecked away. Back-to-back RBI singles by Johnny Lindell and Joe DiMaggio off Joe Hatten made it 6–2 Dodgers in the third. After the Dodgers scored a run in the bottom half of the third on Spider Jorgensen's RBI single after a hit-by-pitch and wild pitch by Karl Drews, Sherm Lollar hit an RBI double in the fourth after a walk and Snuffy Stirnweiss added an RBI single. After two walks in the bottom half of the fourth off Spud Chandler, the Dodgers got those runs back on back-to-back RBI singles by Dixie Walker and Gene Hermanski, but Joe DiMaggio hit a two-run home run in the fifth after a walk. Tommy Henrich's RBI double in the next inning and Yogi Berra's home run in the seventh off Ralph Branca made it 9–8 Dodgers. Reliever Hugh Casey set down Billy Johnson, Phil Rizzuto and Berra in order in the ninth.\nGame 4.\nThe Yankees entered Game 4 aiming to take a three games to one lead in the best-of-seven series, and came one out away from doing this. They scored a run in the first on a bases-loaded walk off Harry Taylor and another in the fourth on Johnny Lindell's double after a leadoff triple off Hal Gregg. Bill Bevens, the Yankee starter, pitched innings without allowing a base hit, but allowed a run in the fifth on Pee Wee Reese's fielder's choice after two walks and a sacrifice bunt. No pitcher had ever thrown a no-hitter in a major league World Series game.\nGoing into the bottom of the ninth inning, Bevens and the Yankees led 2–1. Bevens got Bruce Edwards to fly out, and then walked Carl Furillo. Spider Jorgensen fouled out for the 2nd out. Al Gionfriddo pinch-ran for Furillo. Pete Reiser pinch-hit for pitcher Hugh Casey; during the at-bat, Gionfriddo stole second base. The Yankees then intentionally walked Reiser. Eddie Miksis pinch-ran for Reiser, and the Dodgers sent Cookie Lavagetto to pinch-hit for Eddie Stanky. Lavagetto lined a 1–0 fastball to right field; the ball ricocheted off the wall with a peculiar bounce and hit Yankee right fielder Tommy Henrich in the shoulder, as Gionfriddo and Miksis raced around to score. The play ended the no-hitter and won the game for the Dodgers.\nThe hit was the last of Lavagetto's career. Additionally, neither Lavagetto nor Bevens nor Gionfriddo would play in the majors again following this Series.\nThe Dodgers, with this hit, avoided a three-games-to-one deficit, avoided becoming the victim of a no-hitter, and tied the Series at two games each. The rapid and dramatic reversal of fortunes may have provided a momentum swing.\nAs was the case in their only previous World Series encounter six years earlier, the Yankees and Dodgers again played a dramatic Game 4 which was decided on a lead change with two outs in the ninth inning. In both instances the Yankees entered the game with a 2–1 series lead and Hugh Casey ended up being the pitcher of record for the Dodgers (losing in 1941, winning in 1947).\nGame 5.\nNine walks in fewer than five innings proved the undoing of Rex Barney in this start for Brooklyn. A pair of walks and RBI single by opposing pitcher Spec Shea in the fourth put the Yankees up 1–0. Joe DiMaggio homered to left in the fifth. That was all the runs the visiting Yanks would get at Ebbets Field, but this was all Shea needed. A hit by Jackie Robinson in the sixth scored Al Gionfriddo to pull the Dodgers within 2–1. Then in the ninth, after a Bruce Edwards leadoff single and sacrifice bunt by Carl Furillo, the tying run died on base. Shea got Spider Jorgensen on a fly to right, and with Brooklyn's fans on their feet, pinch-hitter Cookie Lavagetto struck out.\nGame 6.\nThe Dodgers won Game 6 to force a seventh and deciding game. Three straight singles loaded the bases in the first with no outs, then Dixie Walker's double play and Allie Reynolds's passed ball scored a run each. In the third, three straight doubles by Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson and Walker made it 4–0 Dodgers. In the bottom of the inning, after a double and wild pitch by Vic Lombardi, an error on Snuffy Stirnweiss's ground ball allowed a run to score. After a single, Johnny Lindell's RBI single cut the Dodgers' lead to 4–2. After another single knocked Lombardie out of the game, RBI singles by Billy Johnson and Bobby Brown off Ralph Branca tied the game. Yogi Berra's RBI single next inning put the Yankees up 5–4. In the sixth, after a leadoff single and double off Joe Page, Cookie Lavagetto's sacrifice fly tied the game, then Bobby Bragan's RBI single put the Dodgers up 6–5. After a single knocked Page out of the game, Reese's two-run single off Bobo Newsom made it 8–5 Dodgers.\nA catch made by Al Gionfriddo, replayed countless times, may be the most remembered play of this game, and one of the most remembered plays of the Series.\nIn the last of the sixth, the Dodgers sent Al Gionfriddo to left field as a defensive replacement for Eddie Miksis. Joe Hatten came in to pitch. With two on and two outs, Joe DiMaggio came to bat for the Yankees, representing the potential tying run. DiMaggio drove the ball deep, and Gionfriddo quickly pedalled back to snare it just in front of the bullpen-alley fence, near the marker posted to the center field side of the bullpen alley (the sign on the left field side of the alley was posted as 402). Radio announcer Red Barber provided the play-by-play, which has often accompanied re-played film footage:\nMany announcers since that time have used variations of the call, especially Chris Berman of ESPN. These announcers have tended to describe the \"ball itself\" as going \"back-back-back\". In Barber's call, it was the \"outfielder\" who was going \"back-back-back\".\nFilms of the play showed DiMaggio, heading for second, kick the dirt in disgust after he realized Gionfriddo had caught the ball. This was a surprise to many who witnessed it, since DiMaggio was known to never show his emotions while playing. Red Barber declared it, \"probably the only time ever that DiMaggio was publicly and visibly upset.\" \nThree of the 1947 Series' prominent figures, Gionfriddo, Lavagetto and Bevens, finished their playing careers in this Series. Gionfriddo did not play in Game 7, and his catch of DiMaggio's drive was his only put-out in this game. So Gionfriddo's famous catch was his final put-out in his major league career.\nThe Yankees loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth off Joe Hatten and Hugh Casey, but scored only once on a groundout.\nGame 7.\nThe scoring began in the second inning, when the Dodgers strung together four consecutive hits: three off of Yankee starter Spec Shea, and a fourth off of reliever Bill Bevens, to put the Dodgers ahead, 2–0, in the top half of the inning. Gene Hermanski tripled, Bruce Edwards drove Hermanski in with a single, and Carl Furillo followed with another single, prompting a pitching change. Spider Jorgensen greeted reliever Bevens with a double, scoring Edwards for the second run.\nIn the bottom half of the second inning, the Yankees cut the lead to 2–1. After Dodger starter Hal Gregg issued two walks, Phil Rizzuto delivered an RBI single, scoring George McQuinn.\nIn the bottom of the fourth, the Yankees took the lead with a two-out rally. With two runners on, Bobby Brown, pinch-hitting for Bevens, doubled off of Gregg, scoring Billy Johnson to tie the game. Hank Behrman replaced Gregg. After a walk loaded the bases, Tommy Henrich stroked an RBI single, scoring Rizzuto and putting the Yankees up 3–2.\nWith this lead, Yankee pitcher Joe Page entered the game to begin the top of the fifth inning, and would close the game out. Over the next five innings, Page retired 13 consecutive Dodger batters. During this time, the Yankees added two runs. Rizzuto lead off the bottom of the sixth with a bunt single, and stole second base; Allie Clark drove him home with a single off of Joe Hatten, making the score 4–2. In the bottom of the seventh, Aaron Robinson hit a sacrifice fly off of Hugh Casey, to score Billy Johnson, who had just tripled.\nIn all, Page pitched five innings of one-hit, shutout relief. With one out in the top of the ninth, he allowed his first and only baserunner of the outing, when Eddie Miksis singled. Page quickly recovered, inducing Edwards to ground into a double play that ended the game.\nComposite line score.\n1947 World Series (4–3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)\nRecords and important events.\nFor the first time, a World Series produced total receipts over $2 million: Gate receipts were $1,781,348.92, radio rights $175,000.00 and television rights $65,000.\nYogi Berra pinch-hit for Sherm Lollar in the seventh inning of Game 3 and hit the first pinch-hit home run in World Series history. Ralph Branca served the pitch.\nThis was the first World Series to be televised, although the games were only seen in a small number of Eastern markets with stations connected via coaxial cable: New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Schenectady, New York; Washington, DC; and environs surrounding these cities. The October 18, 1947 edition of \"Billboard\" reported that a total of over 3.9 million people viewed the seven games, primarily on TV sets located in bars (\"Billboard\" estimated 5,400 tavern TV sets in NYC alone, with 4,870 in use). The October 13, 1947, edition of \"Time\" magazine reported that President Truman, who had just made the first Oval Office TV appearance on October 5, 1947, and received the first TV for the White House, watched parts of the Series but \"skipped the last innings\".\nAt the direction of Commissioner Happy Chandler, the Series, for the first time, used six umpires to make calls. Series from 1918 through 1946 used four umpires in the infield, with two alternates available if needed. However, no alternate had ever been needed, and Chandler believed that enlisting these umpires to make calls along the outfield lines would put these men and their skills to better use. However, it was not until 1964 that the additional two umpires rotated into the infield during the course of the Series.\nThis was the first, and to date only, World Series in which the Yankees won Game 7 in their home stadium."

        "text": "The 1948 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1948 season. The 45th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians and the National League (NL) champion Boston Braves. The Braves had won the National League pennant for the first time since the \"Miracle Braves\" team of , while the Indians had spoiled a chance for the only all-Boston World Series by winning a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox for the American League flag. Though superstar pitcher Bob Feller failed to win either of his two starts, the Indians won the Series in six games to capture their second championship (as well as their most recent) and their first since .\nIt was the first World Series to be televised beyond the previous year's limited New York-Schenectady-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington network and was announced by famed sportcasters Red Barber, Tom Hussey (in Boston) and Van Patrick (in Cleveland). This was the second appearance in the Fall Classic for both teams, with the Indians' lone previous appearance coming in a 1920 win against the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Braves' lone previous appearance coming in a 1914 win against the Philadelphia Athletics. Consequently, this was the first, and to date only, World Series in which both participating teams had previously played in, but not yet lost, a previous World Series. Currently, this phenomenon can only be repeated if the Miami Marlins or the Washington Nationals play against either the Toronto Blue Jays or the Los Angeles Angels in a future World Series.\nTelevision coverage of the World Series increased this year, but due to the medium still being in its infancy coverage was strictly regional. The series was open to any channel with an affiliation with one of the national broadcast networks: NBC, CBS, ABC, or DuMont. But games played in Boston could only be seen in the Northeast, while when the series shifted to Cleveland those games were the first to be aired in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Detroit and Toledo. \nThis was the only World Series played between and not to feature a New York team, and the last not won by a New York team until the 1957 Series (which the Braves, having relocated to Milwaukee, won over the Yankees). The two teams would meet again in the 1995 Series, with the Braves—by then relocated to Atlanta—winning. This was the first World Series, and the last until , in which both teams scored the same number of total runs. This would be the final World Series to feature a team helmed by a player-manager. This World Series also marks the longest active championship drought for the winning team. This is also the only World Series pre-1967 in which the winning team had not won at least one Commissioner's Trophy after its introduction in the 1967 World Series. \nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nBraves pitcher Johnny Sain and Indians pitcher Bob Feller were engaged in a scoreless pitchers' duel when the Braves came to bat in the bottom of the eighth inning. Feller walked Braves catcher Bill Salkeld to open the inning. Braves manager, Billy Southworth then replaced the slow-footed Salkeld with Phil Masi, who entered the game as a pinch runner. Mike McCormick followed with a sacrifice bunt, advancing Masi to second base. Feller issued an intentional walk to Eddie Stanky, who was replaced by Sibby Sisti. Feller then tried to pick off Masi at second base. Indians' shortstop Lou Boudreau appeared to tag Masi out, but umpire Bill Stewart called him safe. Tommy Holmes proceeded to hit a single that allowed Masi to score the only run of the game, giving the Braves a 1–0 victory.\nThe umpire's controversial ruling touched off heated debates among the media and fans, especially after Associated Press photographs of the play were published. Although Feller allowed only two hits, he took the loss in what would be the closest he came to winning a World Series game. Upon his death in 1990, Masi's will revealed that he really was out on the pick-off play.\nGame 2.\nThe second game also made television history when a live broadcast of the Indians–Braves matchup was shown aboard the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's \"Marylander\" passenger train travelling between Washington, D.C., and New York City, using a receiver operated by Bendix Corporation technicians. An Associated Press reporter observing the demonstration said, \"Technically, it was surprisingly good.\" The Braves scored a run in the first off Bob Lemon on Bob Elliott's RBI single with two on, but Lemon held them scoreless for the rest of the game. After three shutout innings, Lou Boudreau hit a leadoff double in the fourth off Warren Spahn, then scored on Joe Gordon's single with Gordon advancing to second on the throw to home. One out later, Larry Doby's RBI single put the Indians up 2–1. Next inning, Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Boudreau's single. The Indians scored one more run in the ninth off Nels Potter when Jim Hegan reached on an error, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on Bob Kennedy's single. The series was tied 1–1 heading to Cleveland.\nGame 3.\nFor the third straight game, no home runs were hit by either team. This would not happen again in a World Series until . The game's two runs came on Larry Doby's groundout in the third after a double and walk and Jim Hegan's RBI single after a single and walk in the fourth, both off Vern Bickford. Gene Bearden pitched a complete shutout, allowing five hits while striking out four, as the Indians took a 2–1 series lead.\nGame 4.\nSteve Gromek of the Indians and Johnny Sain of the Braves pitched complete games each. The Indians struck first when Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff single in the first and scored on Lou Boudreau's double, then added to their lead on Larry Doby's home run in the third. Marv Rickert's leadoff home run in the seventh cut the Indians' lead to 2–1, but they held on to take a 3–1 series lead.\nGame 5.\nSatchel Paige appeared for the Indians, becoming the first black pitcher to take the mound in World Series history. The previous day's single-game attendance record was broken with 86,288 fans. After two leadoff singles, Bob Elliott's three-run home run in the first off Indians starter Bob Feller made it 3–0 Braves. Dale Mitchell's leadoff home run in the bottom half off Nels Potter put the Indians on the board. Elliott's second home run of the game in the third made it 4–1 Braves, but in the fourth after a leadoff single and walk, Walt Judnich's RBI single made it 4–2 Braves, then one out later, Jim Hegan's three-run home run put the Indians in front 5–4 and knock Potter out of the game. Bill Salkeld's home run in the sixth tied the game. Next inning, Tommy Holmes hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Earl Torgeson's RBI single. Ed Klieman relieved Feller and allowed a walk, two-runs single to Marv Rickert, and another walk. Russ Christopher then allowed RBI singles to Mike McCormick and Eddie Stanky. Warren Spahn's sacrifice fly off Paige capped the game's scoring at 11–5. Spahn pitched shutout innings of relief for the win, forcing a Game 6 in Boston.\nGame 6.\nThe Indians struck first in Game 6 when Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff double in the third off Bill Voiselle and scored on Lou Boudreau's RBI double, but the Braves tied the game on Mike McCormick's RBI single with two on off Bob Lemon in the fourth. A walk loaded the bases, but Voiselle grounded out to end the inning. Joe Gordon's leadoff home in the sixth put the Indians back in front 2–1. After a one-out walk and single, Jim Hegan's RBI groundout extended their lead to 3–1. Three straight singles in the eighth by Ken Keltner, Thurman Tucker and Eddie Robinson made it 4–1 Indians. In the bottom of the inning, the Braves loaded the bases off Lemon on a single, double and walk. Clint Conatser's sacrifice fly and Phil Masi's RBI double off Gene Bearden made it 4–3 Indians, but Bearden pitched a scoreless ninth for the save to give the Indians the championship, currently their last.\nComposite box.\n1948 World Series (4–2): Cleveland Indians (AL) over Boston Braves (NL)"

        "text": "The 1949 World Series featured the New York Yankees and Brooklyn Dodgers, with the Yankees winning in five games for their second defeat of the Dodgers in three years, and the 12th championship in team history. This victory would start a record run of five straight World Series championships by the Yankees, and was also the first of 14 AL pennants in 16 years (1949–1964 except for 1954 and 1959) for the Yankees.\nBoth teams finished the regular season with exactly the same records and winning their respective leagues by one game.\nWith improvements in the then-infant television medium, the broadcast of the World Series could now be seen east of the Mississippi River. For the second consecutive season, the games were open to any channel with an affiliation with one of the national broadcast networks: NBC, CBS, ABC, or DuMont.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nDon Newcombe of the Dodgers threw a complete game, five-hitter allowing only one run in a 1–0 losing effort. He struck out 11 Yankees during that game to tie the record for most strikeouts during a World Series game by a losing pitcher. Tommy Henrich led off the bottom of the ninth by tagging Newcombe for the first walk-off home run in World Series history.\nGame 2.\nPreacher Roe pitched a six-hit shutout, getting the only run he needed early when Jackie Robinson doubled and Gil Hodges singled. Yankee Stadium came alive in the ninth with Joe DiMaggio's leadoff hit, but Roe retired the next three Yankees for the win, the second straight 1–0 result of the Series.\nUpon the completion of game 2, 1949 became the first World Series to contain multiple 1–0 games, a distinction only matched in 1966.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, the Yankees struck first in the third on Phil Rizzuto's sacrifice fly with two on off Ralph Branca, but Pee Wee Reese tied the game in the fourth on a home run off Tommy Byrne. In the ninth, two walks and a single loaded the bases with two outs, when Johnny Mize delivered a two-run pinch-hit single to right. Brooklyn starter Ralph Branca was then replaced by Jack Banta, who gave up an RBI single to Jerry Coleman that made it 4–1 Yankees. It seemed safe until Luis Olmo and Roy Campanella homered in the bottom of the ninth, but Joe Page hung on for the win after innings in relief.\nGame 4.\nCliff Mapes broke a scoreless tie in the fourth inning with a two-run double off Don Newcombe. Yankee pitcher Eddie Lopat aided his own cause with an RBI double, and the advantage ballooned to 6–0 after a bases-loaded Bobby Brown triple scored three more in the fifth off Joe Hatten. Lopat pitched five scoreless innings before allowing two lead-off singles in the sixth. After a double play moved Pee Wee Reese to third, Jackie Robinson's RBI single put the Dodgers on the board. After a Gil Hodges single, RBI singles by Luis Olmo, Roy Campanella, and Gene Hermanski chased Lopat and cheered Ebbets Field's fans, bringing the Dodgers back to within 6–4. After that, though, Allie Reynolds held the home team hitless.\nGame 5.\nA shaky start by Rex Barney. proved costly for Brooklyn. In the first, the Yankees loaded the bases on two walks and an error before Joe DiMaggio's sacrifice fly and Bobby Brown's RBI single put them up 2–0. In the third, the Yankees again loaded the bases on two walks and a single before a Jerry Coleman two-run single knocked Barney out of the game. Vic Raschi's RBI single off Jack Banta made it 5–0 Yankees. The Dodgers got on the board in the bottom half off Raschi when Roy Campanella doubled and scored on Pee Wee Reese's single, but the Yankees got that run back with a Joe DiMaggio home run in the fourth. Next inning, Gene Woodling hit a leadoff double and scored on two groundouts. In the sixth, after a walk and single off Carl Erskine, Yogi Berra's sacrifice fly made it 8–1 Yankees, then after a pop out, a Bobby Brown RBI triple aided by an error that allowed Brown himself to score extended their lead to 10–1. The Dodgers got a run in the bottom half on Gene Hermanski's RBI single after a double and walk. Next inning, after a one-out single and walk, Jackie Robinson's sacrifice fly made it 10–3 Yankees, then after another walk, Gil Hodges's three-run home run cut their lead to 10–6. However, Joe Page held the Dodgers scoreless for the rest of the game to give the Yankees the title. \nHistory was made in the ninth inning when the Ebbets Field lights were turned on, making this the first World Series game finished under artificial lights. The first scheduled Series night game would not be held until .\nWith the death of Eddie Robinson in 2021, this is the earliest World Series from which a player is still living.

        "title": "1953 World Series",
        "text": "The 1953 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1953 season. The 50th edition of the World Series, it matched the four-time defending champions New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers in a rematch of the 1952 Series, and the fourth such matchup between the two teams in the past seven seasons. The Yankees won in six games for their fifth consecutive title—a mark which has not been equalled—and their 16th overall. It was also the last of seven consecutive World Series wins by teams from the American League, the longest such streak for the AL in series history. Billy Martin won World Series MVP honors as he hit .500 with a record-tying 12 hits and a walk-off RBI single in Game 6.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nBefore a full house (69,734 in attendance), the Yankees scored four runs in the first inning. Brooklyn starter Carl Erskine did not last past the first. After a one-out walk, an RBI triple by Hank Bauer put the Yankees up 1–0. After a strikeout, two more walks loaded the bases before Billy Martin cleared them with a triple of his own and the Dodgers pinch-hit for Erskine in the top of the second. They did not score off Allie Reynolds until the fifth on a Jim Gilliam home run. Yogi Berra matched it in the bottom of the fifth with a home run of his own, and the Yankee lead looked safe until a leadoff home run by Gil Hodges and two-run home run by pinch-hitter George Shuba chased Reynolds in the sixth. Brooklyn tied it an inning later against Johnny Sain with consecutive leadoff singles by Roy Campanella, Hodges and Carl Furillo. A home run by unsung first baseman Joe Collins proved the game-winner off Clem Labine, with winning pitcher Johnny Sain providing two more runs himself in the eighth off Ben Wade with a two-run double. Sain then scored on a Joe Collins single, and pitched a scoreless ninth to give the Yankees a 9–5 win and 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nHe looked shaky in the first, walking three, hitting a batter, and allowing a sacrifice fly to Yogi Berra for the game's first run, but Brooklyn's Preacher Roe settled down after that and engaged Eddie Lopat in a complete-game pitching duel. Billy Cox's two-run double after back-to-back two-out singles in the fourth inning put the Dodgers up 2–1. Billy Martin's leadoff home run off Roe in the seventh inning tied the score. The game-winning blast came from Mickey Mantle, a two-run shot to left field in the bottom of the eighth. Brooklyn got two runners aboard in the ninth, but Lopat was able to retire Duke Snider on a game-ending grounder to second base.\nGame 3.\nAlthough the Yankees won the Series, Brooklyn had at least one shining moment, as pitcher Carl Erskine set a new Series record by striking out 14 Yankees in Game 3. That broke Howard Ehmke's record by one. Ersk's record would stand until Sandy Koufax got 15 in .\nIn that same game, Yogi Berra was hit twice by Erskine, making him the first American League player in World Series history to be a hit-batsman twice during the same game. The Yankees struck first in the fifth on an RBI single by Gil McDougald with runners on second and third, but the Dodgers tied it in the bottom half on Billy Cox's fielder's choice with Jackie Robinson at third. Robinson's RBI single next inning put the Dodgers up 2–1, but again the game became tied at 2–2 in the eighth on an RBI single by the Yankees' Gene Woodling. The decisive blow came in the bottom of the inning when Vic Raschi surrendered a Roy Campanella home run, which proved to be the game-winner.\nGame 4.\nThe home team won for the fourth consecutive time. Whitey Ford lasted just one inning as the Yankees' starter, allowing a leadoff ground-rule double to Jim Gilliam, who scored on Jackie Robinson's single. After a forceout, wild pitch and intentional walk, Duke Snider's two-run double made it 3–0 Dodgers. Gilliam's double in the fourth off Tom Gorman made it 4–0, but Brooklyn's lead was cut in half in the fifth when Billy Loes gave up a two-run home run to Gil McDougald. Snider's leadoff home run in the sixth off Johnny Sain made it 5–2 Dodgers, then after a double and single, Gilliam's sacrifice fly extended that lead to 6–2. Next inning, after a two-out walk, Snider's RBI double off Art Schallock made it 7–2 Dodgers. In the ninth, two singles and walk loaded the bases with no outs for the Yankees. Clem Labine relieved Loes and got two-outs before Mickey Mantle's RBI single cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–3, but Billy Martin was thrown out trying to score from second base to end the game, tying the series 2–2.\nGame 5.\nYankees manager Casey Stengel gave the ball to Jim McDonald for Game 5 and, while he gave up a dozen hits, he got them a win. Brooklyn starter Johnny Podres was jolted by a Gene Woodling home run to begin the game. After the Dodgers tied the game in the second on two singles followed by shortstop Phil Rizzuto's throwing error on Carl Furillo's ground ball, Podres was chased in a five-run third. Rizzuto drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on two groundouts, and scored on when first baseman Gil Hodges misplayed Joe Collins's groundball. A hit-by-pitch and walk loaded the bases, and the first man Podres's replacement Russ Meyer faced was Mickey Mantle, who greeted him with a grand slam. Duke Snider's RBI single after a hit-by-pitch and single made it 6–2 Yankees in the fifth, but in the seventh, Billy Martin's two-run home run off Meyer extended their lead to 8–2. Rizzuto singled with two outs and scored on McDonald's double. The Yankees added another run in the eighth when Collins hit a leadoff double off Ben Wade, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Yogi Berra's sacrifice fly, but in the bottom of the inning McDonald allowed two singles, then an RBI single to Furillo before a three-run Billy Cox home run cut their lead to 10–6. He was relieved by Bob Kuzava, who struck out Dick Williams to end the inning. Each team got a run in the ninth on a home run, Gil McDougald for the Yankees off Joe Black and Jim Gilliam for the Dodgers off Kuzava. Allie Reynolds was brought in to retire Jackie Robinson for the final out.\nGame 6.\nIn Game 6, after a walk, strikeout and single, Yogi Berra's ground-rule double put the Yankees up 1–0 in the first off Carl Erskine. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, an error on Billy Martin's ground ball made it 2–0 Yankees. Next inning, Gene Woodling's sacrifice fly after two leadoff singles made it 3–0 Yankees. Starter Whitey Ford pitched five shutout innings, but in the sixth, allowed a one-out double to Jackie Robinson, who stole third and scored on Roy Campanella's groundout. Down 3–1 in the ninth, Brooklyn rallied back on a Duke Snider walk followed by a Carl Furillo home run off Allie Reynolds. However, Yankee second baseman Billy Martin—who made a game-saving catch in Game 7 of the 1952 World Series—again ruined the Dodgers' dreams of a championship. In the bottom of the ninth, with a runner on second base, Martin drilled a Clem Labine sinker up the middle for a Series-winning RBI single.\nAftermath.\nDropping their seventh Series without a victory, the Dodgers terminated manager Chuck Dressen's contract; Dressen was demanding two more years. Walter Alston took his place and managed the Dodgers for the next 23 seasons (1954–1976), leading them to four World Series championships in , , , and before being replaced by Tommy Lasorda, who would manage the team for 20 years himself (1976–1996). Lasorda would lead the Dodgers to a pair of World Series championships in and .\nComposite box.\n1953 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)\nBroadcasting.\nThe Series was broadcast on NBC television, with Yankees announcer Mel Allen and Dodgers announcer Vin Scully describing the action; and on Mutual radio, with Al Helfer and Gene Kelly announcing.\nRed Barber, Vin Scully's senior on the Dodgers' broadcast crew, was originally selected to work with Allen on NBC, but was removed from the Series due to a salary dispute with Gillette, which sponsored the broadcasts.

        "text": "The 1954 World Series matched the National League champion New York Giants against the American League champion Cleveland Indians. The Giants swept the Series in four games to win their first championship since , defeating the heavily favored Indians, who had won an AL-record 111 games in the 154-game regular season (a record since broken by the 1998 New York Yankees with 114 and again by the 2001 Seattle Mariners with 116).\n\"The Catch\" occurred during Game 1 of this series, when Giants center fielder Willie Mays snared a long drive by Vic Wertz near the outfield wall with his back to the infield. Utility player Dusty Rhodes had clutch hits in three of the four games, including a pinch-hit walk-off that won Game 1, barely clearing the right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Giants manager Leo Durocher, who had managed teams to three National League championships, won his only World Series title as a manager. The Giants, who moved west to San Francisco in 1958, did not win another World Series until 2010.\nThis was the first time that the Indians had been swept in a World Series and the first time that the Giants had swept an opponent in four games (their 1922 sweep included a controversial tie game). Game 2 was the last World Series and playoff game at the Polo Grounds, and Game 4 was the last World Series and playoff game at Cleveland Stadium. The Indians' next World Series was in , a year after Jacobs Field opened.\nThe National Football League game between the Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions, scheduled for October 3 at Cleveland Stadium, was postponed to December 19. \nThis was the first World Series since 1948 to not feature the Yankees.\nBackground.\nThe Indians, by winning the American League pennant, kept the Yankees from having a chance to win their sixth straight series. The last time the Yankees had been absent from the World Series was 1948, when the Indians defeated the Boston Braves to win the championship. This was also the only World Series from 1949 to 1958 in which the Yankees did not participate.\nThe Indians easily won the 1954 pennant on the strength of the American League's top pitching staff, leading the AL in team earned run average at 2.72 and complete games with 77. Pitchers Early Wynn (23–11, 2.73 earned run average) and Bob Lemon (23–7, 2.72 earned run average) were in top form, with solid contributions from Mike Garcia (19–8, 2.64) and Art Houtterman (15–7, 3.35). Bob Feller, at age 35, could make only 19 starts, and finished at 13–3. Cleveland also had potent hitting, leading the AL in home runs (156) and finishing second in runs scored (746), although the team managed just 30 stolen bases in 63 attempts. Bobby Ávila led the offense with 112 runs and a .341 batting average, while Larry Doby (.272 batting average, 32 home runs, 126 runs batted in) and Al Rosen (.300 batting average, 24 home runs, 102 runs batted in) provided the power. Catcher Jim Hegan made only four errors in 134 games and threw out 44% of would-be base stealers.\nThe Giants entered the World Series with a top-flight pitching staff as well, with Johnny Antonelli (21–7, 2.30 earned run average), Rubén Gómez (17–9, 2.88) and 37-year-old Sal \"The Barber\" Maglie (14–6, 3.26). The Giants relied more heavily on relief pitching with Hoyt Wilhelm (12–7, 2.10, 7 saves) and Marv Grissom (10–7, 2.35, 19 saves) rounding out a staff that led the NL in team earned run average at 3.09 and shutouts with 17. Manager Leo Durocher used a solid, consistent lineup with all of his starters, except for the catching position, playing in at least 135 games. Willie Mays (.345 batting average, 41 home runs, 110 runs batted in) led an offense that also featured Don Mueller (.342 batting average), Alvin Dark (.293 batting average, 98 runs), Hank Thompson (26 home runs, 86 runs batted in) and pinch-hitter extraordinaire Dusty Rhodes (.341 batting average).\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nCleveland got on the board right away against Sal Maglie. Leadoff man Al Smith was hit by a pitch, Bobby Ávila singled and Vic Wertz brought home both with a triple to right. Don Liddle and Marv Grissom held them scoreless for the rest of the game.\nBob Lemon gave two back in the third on singles by Whitey Lockman and Alvin Dark, a run-scoring groundout by Don Mueller, a walk to Willie Mays and a Hank Thompson run-scoring single.\nMays saved the day in the eighth after leadoff singles by Larry Doby and Al Rosen led to starting pitcher Maglie being lifted for Liddle. Wertz's drive to deep center field would have scored both if not for Mays' memorable catch.\nWertz opened the 10th inning with another hard-hit ball in Mays’ direction, which again would have required a great defensive play by the Giants' centerfielder but landed for a double. (Wertz thus ended his afternoon having gone 4-for-5 with three extra-base hits and batting in the Indians’ two runs.) However, this potential 10th-inning rally was to no avail, as the Indians batted only 1-for-16 with runners in scoring position in the game, and went hitless (0-for-13) in such situations after Wertz’s two-run triple in the first inning.\nLemon went all the way for Cleveland, losing it in the 10th when Dusty Rhodes, pinch-hitting for Monte Irvin with two Giants on base, hit a walk-off home run.\nGame 2.\nOnce again, the visitors started quickly but could not hold their lead. Al Smith's leadoff home run off Johnny Antonelli put Cleveland up 1–0. Early Wynn preserved that lead, pitching four perfect innings, but in the fifth inning, Willie Mays walked and Hank Thompson singled, and Dusty Rhodes, again pinch-hitting for Monte Irvin, delivered a run-scoring single. Antonelli gave himself the go-ahead run by scoring Thompson on a groundout. New York had just four hits, but Rhodes padded the Giants' lead with a home run leading off the seventh. Their other hit came in the sixth inning on an Alvin Dark leadoff single. Antonelli walked six but struck out nine, pitching a complete game to give the Giants a 2–0 series lead. This was the last postseason game at the Polo Grounds.\nGame 3.\nA huge crowd of 71,555 hoped to see Cleveland get its first win, but things did not go well for the home team. The Indians trailed 1–0 quickly when Whitey Lockman singled, took second on a groundout and scored on a hit by Willie Mays. The run was scored as unearned because of an error by shortstop George Strickland. With the bases loaded in the third, pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes hit a two-run single. An error by pitcher Mike Garcia on Davey Williams' bunt attempt gave the Giants another run to make it 4–0. The Giants added to their lead on run-scoring singles by Wes Westrum off of Art Houtteman in the fifth and by Mays off of Ray Narleski in the sixth. Ruben Gomez gave up just four hits and two runs (a Vic Wertz home run in the seventh and an error by shortstop Alvin Dark on a ground ball by Al Smith), with knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm mopping up for the save.\nGame 4.\nCleveland's slim comeback chances took a beating as the Indians fell hopelessly behind, 7–0. The scoring started on a pair of Cleveland errors in the second inning. A run-scoring double by Mays in the third scored another run. The Giants' four-run fifth inning broke the game wide open. Starter Bob Lemon loaded the bases and was pulled for Hal Newhouser, who faced just two batters, giving up a walk to Thompson and two-run single to Irvin. The Giants added another run in the inning on Wes Westrum's sacrifice fly against Ray Narleski. A brief glimmer of hope for the home team came in the bottom of the fifth with a couple of Giants errors and a Hank Majeski three-run pinch-hit home run, but except for a meaningless run-scoring single by Rudy Regalado in the seventh off starter Don Liddle, the Indians got nothing more as Hoyt Wilhelm and Game 2 starter Johnny Antonelli came on in relief and the Giants completed a four-game sweep. It was the most unexpected sweep in World Series history, with the Indians having a better regular reason record by 14 games. The only other similar discrepancy in a World Series sweep was the 1990 Cincinnati Reds, who swept an Oakland A's team whose regular season record bested theirs by 12 games. This was also the last World Series before the official World Series MVP award began to be awarded in 1955, though Dusty Rhodes would have been a lock for the award if it had been introduced yet.\nComposite box.\n1954 World Series (4–0): New York Giants (N.L.) over Cleveland Indians (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1955 World Series was the championship series to conclude the 1955 Major League Baseball (MLB) season. The Series matched the National League (NL) pennant winner Brooklyn Dodgers against the American League (AL) pennant winner New York Yankees, with the Dodgers winning the Series in seven games to capture their first championship in franchise history. It would be the only Series the Dodgers won while based in Brooklyn, as the team relocated to Los Angeles after the . This was the fifth time in nine years that the Yankees and the Dodgers met in the World Series, with the Yankees having won in , , , and ; the Yankees would also win in the rematch.\nThis Series also marked the end of a long period of invulnerability for the Yankees in the World Series. It was the Yankees' first loss in a World Series since and only their second since . While the Yankees were 15–2 in Series appearances during that time, they would lose again in , , , and , for a record of 4–5 in World Series over the next decade. \nBackground.\nThis was the sixth World Series contested between the Yankees and Dodgers; the Yankees had won each of the five prior matchups (1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, and 1953). New York manager Casey Stengel had played for the Dodgers from 1912 through 1917.\nBrooklyn Dodgers.\nThe NL champion Dodgers finished the regular season with a record of 98–55, games ahead of the Milwaukee Braves. Offensive team leaders were Duke Snider (.309 batting average, 42 home runs, 136 RBIs, .628 slugging percentage, and 1.046 OPS) and Roy Campanella (.318 batting average, 32 home runs, 107 RBIs, .583 slugging percentage, and .978 OPS). Pitcher Don Newcombe led the team in wins, with a 20–5 record, and innings pitched. Campanella was voted the National League MVP, narrowly edging Snider.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe AL champion Yankees finished the regular season with a record of 96–58, three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians. Offensive team leaders were Mickey Mantle (.306 batting average, 37 home runs, 99 RBIs, .611 slugging percentage, and 1.042 OPS), Yogi Berra (.272 batting average, 27 home runs, 108 RBIs, .470 slugging percentage, and .819 OPS), and Bill Skowron (.319 batting average). Pitcher Whitey Ford led the team in wins, with an 18–7 record, and innings pitched. Berra was voted the American League MVP, while Mantle finished fifth.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn Game 1, Carl Furillo's leadoff home run in the second off Whitey Ford put the Dodgers up 1–0. Jackie Robinson then tripled with one out and scored on Don Zimmer's single, but in the bottom of the inning, after a walk, rookie Elston Howard, in his first World Series at bat, homered to tie the game off Don Newcombe. Duke Snider's leadoff home run next inning put the Dodgers back in front 3–2 (which would eventually help establish a new HR record for a seven-game series at 17), but in the bottom half, the Yankees again tied the score on Irv Noren's RBI groundout with runners on second and third. Joe Collins's leadoff home run next inning put the Yankees ahead 4–3. His two-run home run in the sixth extended their lead to 6–3. In the eighth\n, after a single and error by third baseman Gil McDougald put runners on second and third with one out, Zimmer's sacrifice fly scored a run, then Robinson stole home to cut the Yankees' lead to 6–5, but Ford pitched eight innings for the win while Bob Grim earned the save with a scoreless ninth to give the Yankees a 1–0 series lead.\nRobinson's steal of home.\nJackie Robinson's successful steal of home plate in the 8th inning became a subject of debate between baseball fans that still lingers today. For years, both Yogi Berra and Whitey Ford argued that Robinson was easily out, with Ford pointing out that he knew Robinson was far off of third base, and deliberately did a longer wind-up, instead of pitching from the stretch as pitchers normally do with runners on base, to entice Robinson into trying to steal home plate. Berra claimed that he was able to catch the ball and placed his glove in position for Robinson to slide into the tag. The official World Series newsreel footage was inconclusive, as well as all widely printed photographs. A lesser-known film taken of the play, filmed from the third-base side, showed that Robinson's foot touched the third-base side of home plate, while Berra's glove, with the ball, was briefly on the first-base side before applying the tag, though many baseball fans, particularly Yankee fans, still argue otherwise.\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, Pee Wee Reese lead off the top of the fourth with a double and scored on Duke Snider's single off Tommy Byrne, but in the bottom of the inning, after a two-out single and walk, back-to-back RBI singles by Elston Howard and Billy Martin put the Yankees ahead. After a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, Byrne's two-run single put the Yankees up 4–1 and knocked starter Billy Loes out of the game. The Dodgers got a run in the fifth on Jim Gilliam's RBI single with Jackie Robinson at third, but could not score again off Byrne, who pitched a complete game to give the Yankees a 2–0 series lead heading to Brooklyn.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, Roy Campanella's two-run home run after a walk off Bob Turley in the first put the Dodgers up 2–0, but in the second, Mickey Mantle, who only played in 3 games in this series, hit his only home run of the series. Bill Skowron then doubled and scored on Phil Rizzuto's two-out single to tie the game. In the bottom of the inning, two singles and a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before walks to Jim Gilliam off Turley and Pee Wee Reese off Tom Morgan put the Dodgers up 4–2. In the fourth with two on, Campanella's RBI single and Carl Furillo's sacrifice fly extended the Dodgers' lead to 6–2. In the top of the seventh, Rizzuto walked with two outs and scored on Andy Carey's triple, but in the bottom half, Jackie Robinson doubled with one out off Tom Sturdivant and scored on Sandy Amoros's single. After a forceout and walk, Reese's RBI single extended the Dodgers' lead to 8–3. Johnny Podres pitched a complete game as the Dodgers cut the Yankees' series lead to 2–1. This remains the last World Series game to be played in the month of September.\nGame 4.\nGil McDougald's one-out home run in the first off Carl Erskine put the Yankees up 1–0. In the second, Joe Collins drew a leadoff walk, moved two bases on two groundouts, and scored on Phil Rizzuto's single. In the third, Sandy Amoros drew a leadoff walk off Don Larsen and scored on Jim Gilliam's RBI double. In the top of the fourth, after a leadoff walk and single, Don Bessent relieved Erksine and allowed an RBI single to Billy Martin, but in the bottom of the inning, Roy Campanella hit a leadoff home run and after a single, Gil Hodges's two-run home run put the Dodgers up 4–3. Duke Snider's three-run home run next inning off Johnny Kucks extended their lead to 7–3. In the top of the sixth, Elston Howard hit a leadoff single off Clem Labine and scored on Billy Martin's double. One out later, Eddie Robinson's RBI single cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–5, but the Dodgers added a run in the seventh on three consecutive leadoff singles by Campanella, Carl Furillo and Gil Hodges off Rip Coleman. Labine earned the win with innings to close as the Dodgers tied the series with an 8–5 win.\nGame 5.\nOctober 2, 1955, at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, New York\nIn Game 5, Sandy Amoros's two-run homer in the second off Bob Grim put the Dodgers up 2–0. Next inning, Duke Snider's lead off home run made it 3–0. The Yankees got on the board in the fourth on Billy Martin's RBI single with two off rookie Roger Craig, but Snider's second home run of the game in the fifth gave the Dodgers that run back. Home runs by Bob Cerv in the seventh off Craig and Yogi Berra in the eighth off Clem Labine cut the Dodgers' lead to 4–3, but Brooklyn added an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth off Bob Turley when Carl Furillo hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Jackie Robinson's single. Labine pitched innings in relief for Craig, who won his first World series start, for the save as the Dodgers were one win away from the championship. Snider became the only player from either league with four home runs in two different Series.\nGame 6.\nIn Game 6, the Yankees scored all five of their runs in the first off Karl Spooner. After two walks, back-to-back RBI singles by Yogi Berra and Hank Bauer put them up 2–0 before Bill Skowron capped the scoring with a three-run home run. Whitey Ford pitched a complete game, allowing one run (on Carl Furillo's RBI single in the fourth) and four hits as the Yankees forced a Game 7 with a 5–1 win.\nGame 7.\nThe Dodgers scored the game's only runs on a fourth inning RBI single and sixth inning bases-loaded sacrifice fly, both by Gil Hodges. The RBIs by Hodges were set up by a double by Roy Campanella in the fourth and a lead-off single by Pee Wee Reese in the sixth — the only time a Dodgers lead-off hitter reached base in any inning. While Campanella scored on Hodges' two-out single, Reese had advanced to third on two bunts.\nWhile being shut out by Johnny Podres, the Yankees, meanwhile, scattered eight hits over the six innings in which they were not retired in order. They only mustered one hit with runners in scoring position, though, which ironically was a base hit awarded to Gil McDougald in the third inning, when Phil Rizzuto was hit by a groundball while running the bases. Instead of batting in Rizzuto for a 1–0 Yankees lead, McDougald was thus ruled out to end the inning. Psychologically this may have marked a turning point for the Dodgers, who had never beaten the Yankees in a World Series. Pitcher Carl Erskine saw this play as \"an omen\", as such unfortunate miscues had usually been \"the things that happened to us.\"\nThe Yankees would have three more scoring opportunities against Podres: In the fourth inning, a lead-off double by Yogi Berra was wasted. Then, in the sixth inning, with runners on first and second and one out, left fielder Sandy Amorós made a dramatic game-saving catch of a deep fly ball down the left field line off the bat of Yogi Berra to start a double play. Amorós then threw to Pee Wee Reese and Reese relayed to Gil Hodges, who tagged Yankee Gil McDougald before McDougald could get back to first. This possibly stymied the Yankees' best chance of the day.\nThe Yankees would threaten Podres one last time, when McDougald could not bring a runner in from third with only one out, hitting a short flyball to rightfield, one inning before Elston Howard grounded out to Reese for the final out; the two shared the dubious record for playing in the most losing World Series (six each).\nThis would be the only time in Jackie Robinson's career when he did not play in his team's World Series game. Don Hoak replaced Robinson in the line-up, and played third base.\nFor the first time in Series history, an MVP was selected—Johnny Podres, winning pitcher of Games 3 and 7. He was 2–0, both wins being complete games including the series-clinching Game 7 shutout, and had a 1.00 ERA.\nComposite box.\n1955 World Series (4–3): Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)\nLegacy.\nReferences in popular culture.\nIn her epistolary book (and later stage and film adaptations) 84 Charing Cross Road, the author Helene Hanff reveals herself to be a Brooklyn Dodgers fan and asks her correspondent Frank Doel (along with family) to pray for the Dodgers' fortunes in the series: (sic.) \"I shall be obliged if you will send Nora and the girls to church every Sunday for the next month to pray for the continued health and strength of the messrs. Gilliam, Reese, Snider, Campanella, Robinson, Hodges, Furillo, Podres, Newcombe and Labine, collectively known as The Brooklyn Dodgers.

They won a rematch against the Dodgers the following year, then made three more trips to the World Series during Stengel's tenure, winning in 1958 and losing in 1957 (to Milwaukee) and 1960 (to Pittsburgh). Like this fall classic, Stengel's final four trips as manager went the maximum seven games.\nFor the Dodgers, this was the peak of their success while based in Brooklyn. Three years later, they left Ebbets Field and moved to Los Angeles. Since that time, they have played in 12 World Series, winning six titles, most recently in .\nDodgers pitcher Johnny Podres was the recipient of the very first World Series Most Valuable Player award.\nAs of 2024, Sandy Koufax, although he was not on the World Series roster, is the last living player from the champion Dodgers."

        "title": "1957 World Series",
        "text": "The 1957 World Series featured the defending champion New York Yankees of the American League playing against the Milwaukee Braves of the National League. After finishing just one game behind the N.L. Champion Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956, the Braves came back in 1957 to win their first pennant since moving from Boston in 1953. The Braves won the Series in seven games, behind Lew Burdette's three complete game victories. The Braves would be the only team besides the Yankees, Dodgers, or Giants to win a World Series title in the 1950s.\nThe Yankees had home field advantage in the series. Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 were played at Yankee Stadium, while Milwaukee County Stadium hosted Games 3, 4, and 5. This was the first time since 1946 that the Series included scheduled off days after Games 2 and 5.\nOf the previous ten World Series, the Yankees had participated in eight of them and won seven. This was also the first World Series since 1948 that a team from New York did not win.\nThis is the first of four Yankees-Braves matchups, and the only Series that was won by the Braves; they lost in , and , with the last two instances occurring with the Braves based in Atlanta.\nHank Aaron led all regulars with a .393 average and 11 hits, including a triple, three home runs and seven RBI.\nMilwaukee’s victory marked the first Wisconsin pro championship won by a team other than the Green Bay Packers.\nSummary.\nNote: It was the Braves' first championship since the \"Miracle Braves\" of 1914.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nIn the third inning, the Yankees replaced first baseman Bill Skowron, who was complaining of back pain, with Elston Howard. In the fifth inning the Braves had a runner in scoring position after an error by Howard. The Braves did not manage to capitalize on this opportunity, as second baseman Red Schoendienst grounded out. By the end of the fifth inning, the Braves had left four men on base, with the game still scoreless.\nThe Yankees broke through that inning with a leadoff single by Jerry Coleman, followed by two ground outs which moved the runner to third base, and then a triple by slugger Hank Bauer made the score 1–0. After three consecutive batters reached first base in the Yankees' half of the sixth inning, and a run scored on Andy Carey's single, Milwaukee manager Fred Haney pulled starter Warren Spahn and replaced him with Ernie Johnson.\nThe Yankees scored once more in the sixth inning when Coleman executed a squeeze play, allowing Yogi Berra to score from third base. The Braves managed to score only once, when Wes Covington scored in the seventh on a single by Schoendienst. Whitey Ford pitched a complete game for the Yankees.\nGame 2.\nHank Aaron led off the second inning with a triple, then made it safe at home on Joe Adcock's single. The Yankees responded with one of their own in the bottom half of the second. Again in the third inning, the Yankees and Braves each scored one run, leaving the score 2–2 heading to the fourth inning. Both managers were worried about their starting pitchers, and after three straight singles from Adcock, Andy Pafko, and Wes Covington and with two runs in, Yankees manager Casey Stengel replaced Bobby Shantz with reliever Art Ditmar. Ditmar had finished the regular season with an 8–3 record, a 3.25 ERA and six saves.\nDitmar was able to prevent the Braves from scoring any more runs, but the score was 4–2 in favor of the Braves. After that, Braves starter Lew Burdette's pitching improved significantly. He only gave up four hits for the rest of the game, two of them coming in the ninth inning. After a ground out, Tony Kubek singled to right to start things off. Stengel decided to pinch hit lefty Joe Collins, who was 30–for–149 (.201) that year and was playing what turned out to be his final year, for the right-handed Coleman, who was a better 42–for–157 (.263) and also playing in his final season, to face right-handed pitcher Burdette. Collins popped to Johnny Logan at shortstop for the second out. Then, Stengel again opted to pinch hit for the pitcher, Bob Grim. Howard came up in his spot and singled to advance Kubek to second. Bobby Richardson pinch ran for Howard. Burdette recorded the final out as he got Bauer, the next batter, to ground to short, where Logan forced out Richardson.\nThe Braves' win in Game 2 was the first World Series game won by a non-New York City team since 1948. In every World Series between 1948 and 1957, either both teams were from New York City or a New York City team won in a sweep (1950 and 1954).\nGame 3.\nNew York's Tony Kubek began the scoring with a one-out solo homer in the first inning. After that, things quickly fell apart for Bob Buhl, who had pitched quite well in the regular season (18–7, 2.74 ERA). He walked Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra, then made an error attempting to pick Mantle off at second base. After a sacrifice fly by Gil McDougald and a single by first baseman Harry Simpson, manager Fred Haney pulled Buhl and brought in rookie Juan Pizarro. Pizarro got the final out in the first inning, and followed that with a solid second inning. In the third inning, however, the Yankees began to capitalize on their lead. After allowing hits from Mantle, Berra and Jerry Lumpe, and a walk to Elston Howard, who was pinch-hitting for Harry Simpson, Pizarro was removed from the game. Gene Conley was called in to finish the inning. He did get the last two outs, but gave up a two-run home run to Mantle in the fourth inning.\nBy the bottom of the fifth inning, the score was 7–1 in favor of the Yankees. Logan led off with a single, and Eddie Mathews flied to left. Hank Aaron hit one of his three postseason homers to make the game 7–3. After a Covington walk, Joe Adcock and Bob Hazle each made outs to end the fifth. Yankees relief pitcher Don Larsen had his comfortable lead cut down to just four runs.\nIn the seventh inning the Yankees secured their lead with a five-run inning against reliever Bob Trowbridge. The five runs started with a two-run bases-loaded single by Bauer and a three-run home run by Kubek. The score was 12–3 heading into the bottom of the seventh.\nThere was only one more hit the rest of the game, a single by Aaron in the ninth. Del Crandall made the last out and the series was on to Game 4 with the Yankees up 2–1. Left fielder Kubek was only the second rookie in history to hit two home runs in a World Series game. This was the first World Series game played in the state of Wisconsin.\nGame 4.\nAfter a game with two homers and four RBIs, Tony Kubek led off the first inning for the Yankees, laying down a bunt which ultimately led to a run after Mickey Mantle reached on a fielder's choice, Yogi Berra walked, and Gil McDougald singled.\nThe second inning started with a single by Hank Aaron and then a stolen base by Wes Covington, but they could not convert. The fourth inning began with a walk to Johnny Logan. Eddie Mathews doubled to right field, which sent Logan to third. Aaron then hit a three-run home run which completely cleared the stadium. The next batter, Covington, grounded out. This was followed by a shot off the bat of Frank Torre, a part-time first baseman who was giving Joe Adcock a day off. The Braves were then up 4–1 against Yankees starter Tom Sturdivant.\nThe next four innings for the Yankees were plagued by double plays. Warren Spahn was getting ground out after ground out and the Yankees looked helpless until the ninth. With two outs and a three-run deficit in the top of the ninth, New York found new life in two back-to-back singles. Spahn gave up one to Berra, followed by one to McDougald. With two runners on, Howard hit a three-run homer to tie the game.\nLeft-handed Tommy Byrne had replaced right-handed Johnny Kucks in the eighth inning for New York. This prompted Haney to pinch hit Adcock for Torre. Adcock grounded to shortstop and Milwaukee went 1–2–3 that inning. The game thus went on to extra innings.\nMilwaukee starter Spahn came out for the tenth. Kubek got his second hit in the top of the tenth, followed by a triple by Hank Bauer to score a run. After Mantle flied to right, the Braves got ready for the bottom of the tenth down one. Spahn was due up first for the Braves, and Haney opted to pinch hit with Nippy Jones, who had played in just 30 games that year. In what turned out to be his final appearance, Jones was part of a pivotal play in the inning. A wild Tommy Byrne pitch bounced near Jones, but umpire Donatelli initially called a ball. After an argument hinging on a spot of shoe polish on the baseball, Jones convinced umpire Augie Donatelli that he was hit on the shoe.\nThe inning continued with Felix Mantilla running for Jones. Red Schoendienst hit a sacrifice bunt to advance Mantilla, who scored the tying run on a double by Logan. Mathews followed with a towering two-run home run to win it for the Braves, 7–5, and tied the series at two games apiece.\nGame 5.\nWith the opposing teams' top pitchers, Whitey Ford and Lew Burdette, facing each other, Game 5 was expected to be a low-scoring affair. However, the game started out with the Yankees looking to score in the first inning. After a leadoff single by Hank Bauer and a sacrifice bunt by Tony Kubek, Gil McDougald hit a line drive that turned into the second out of the inning. Yogi Berra then grounded out. After that, Burdette only allowed multiple Yankee baserunners in the fourth inning.\nAt the start of the sixth inning, the game was still scoreless. In the bottom of the sixth with two outs and nobody on, Eddie Mathews, Hank Aaron, and Joe Adcock singled, scoring Mathews and giving the Braves a 1–0 lead that held up for the rest of the game.\nThe Yankees' best scoring chance came in the eighth inning after a hit by Jerry Coleman to right field. Mickey Mantle came in to pinch-run for Coleman, but was caught stealing at second base by catcher Del Crandall. Ford was then taken out and Yankee reliever Bob Turley came in, striking out two batters while giving up no hits in the inning.\nYogi Berra made the last Yankee out in the 1–0 complete-game by Burdette, and the Milwaukee Braves took the series lead three games to two.\nGame 6.\nBob Buhl started for the Braves but did not last very long. In the first two innings, no one scored, although there were some opportunities, including the Yankees' first inning when Enos Slaughter reached third and Yogi Berra got to second on Buhl's wild pitch. Buhl struck out Gil McDougald to end the inning.\nIn the bottom of the third, the Yankees scored two runs to take the lead on a Berra two-run homer, scoring Slaughter. After that Ernie Johnson replaced Buhl. Johnson then held the Yankees scoreless until the seventh inning.\nThe Braves cut the lead in their half in the fifth on Frank Torre's home run, his second of the series. The Braves then tied it in the top of the seventh with a homer by Hank Aaron, his third. The game was now tied and Braves' pitcher Johnson was holding the Yankees to just one hit in innings. Leading off the seventh, pitcher Bob Turley was out on a bunt attempt with two strikes. Then, right fielder Hank Bauer hit a home run off the left-field foul pole to give the Yankees a one-run lead.\nIn the Braves' ninth, after an Eddie Mathews walk, Turley got lefty Wes Covington to ground into a 1–6–3 double play to end the game and force a deciding Game 7.\nGame 7.\nLew Burdette was called in to start game 7 for the Braves on two days' rest when the expected starter, Warren Spahn, was struck with the Asian flu.\nAfter two scoreless innings, the Braves broke through in the third, started by a Bob Hazle single and an error by Tony Kubek at third base; one of three Yankee errors in the game. The inning continued with a hard-hit Eddie Mathews double, which prompted Casey Stengel to take out starter Don Larsen and bring in lefty Bobby Shantz. Shantz then gave up an RBI single to Hank Aaron and a single by Wes Covington advanced Aaron to third. Frank Torre grounded into a fielders' choice which scored Aaron. Felix Mantilla then flied to Hank Bauer in right to end the inning, ending the Braves' scoring at four runs.\nThe Yankees' best chance came in the sixth, when they had runners on first and second with two outs after a Mickey Mantle single and an error by Mathews at third. Gil McDougald then grounded out forcing Mantle at third to end the inning and the threat.\nIn the ninth, after Milwaukee made it 5–0 on a Del Crandall homer, the Yankees attempted to mount a rally. With two outs and McDougald on first base, Jerry Coleman singled to right. Then, Tommy Byrne singled to load the bases for Bill Skowron. With the tying run on deck, Burdette retired Skowron on a ground out to third with Mathews making the final out which secured the world championship for the Braves.\nIn the game, the Yankees were limited to seven hits and one walk. Burdette was named the Series MVP after pitching three complete games and two shutouts. He was the first pitcher since Christy Mathewson to pitch two shutouts in a World Series.\nDespite the Yankees having made 17 more appearances in the World Series since this one, this game, to date, is the most recent time the team has hosted a World Series Game 7.\nComposite line score.\n1957 World Series (4–3): Milwaukee Braves (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1917 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1917 season. The 14th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Chicago White Sox against the National League champion New York Giants. The White Sox won the Series four games to two. The Series was played against the backdrop of World War I, which dominated the American newspapers that year and next.\nThe strong Chicago White Sox club had finished the 1917 season with a 100–54 record: their only 100-win season in franchise history as of 2023. The Sox's next World Series winner in 2005 would finish the regular season with a 99–63 record.\nThe Sox won Game 1 of the Series in Chicago 2–1 behind a complete game by Eddie Cicotte. Happy Felsch hit a home run in the fourth inning that provided the winning margin. The Sox beat the Giants in Game 2 7–2 behind another complete game effort by Red Faber to take a 2–0 lead in the Series.\nBack in New York for Game 3, Cicotte again threw a complete game, but the Sox could not muster a single run against Giants' starter Rube Benton and lost 2–0. In Game 4 the Sox were shut out again 5–0 by Ferdie Schupp. Faber threw another complete game, but the Series was even at 2–2 going back to Chicago.\nReb Russell started Game 5 in Chicago, but only faced three batters before giving way to Cicotte. Going into the bottom of the seventh inning, Chicago was down 5–2, but they rallied to score three in the seventh and three in the eighth to win 8–5. Faber pitched the final two innings for the win. In Game 6 the Sox took an early 3–0 lead and on the strength of another complete-game victory from Faber (his third of the Series) won 4–2 and clinched the World Championship. Eddie Collins was the hitting hero, batting .409 over the six game series while Cicotte and Faber combined to pitch 50 out of a total 52 World Series innings to lead the staff.\nThe decisive game underscored the Giants' post-season frustrations, featuring a famous rundown in which Giants' third baseman Heinie Zimmerman futilely chased the speedy Eddie Collins toward home plate with what would be the Series-winning run. Catcher Bill Rariden had run up the third base line to start a rundown, expecting pitcher Rube Benton or first baseman Walter Holke to cover the plate. However, neither of them budged, forcing Zimmerman to chase Collins while pawing helplessly in the air with the ball in an attempt to tag him. Two years before the issue of baseball betting reached its peak, Zimmerman found himself having to publicly deny purposely allowing the run to score, i.e. to deny that he had \"thrown\" the game. In truth, McGraw blamed Benton and Holke for failing to cover the plate. A quote often attributed to Zim, but actually invented by writer Ring Lardner some years later, was that when asked about the incident Zim replied, \"Who the hell was I supposed to throw to, Klem (umpire Bill Klem, who was working the plate)?\" Conventional wisdom has it that Collins was much faster than Zimmerman, but existing photos of the play show that Zimmerman was only a step or two behind Collins, who actually slid across the plate while Zim jumped over him to avoid trampling him. Zimmerman would eventually be banned for life due to various accusations of corruption.\nThe great athlete Jim Thorpe, better known for football in general, made his only World Series \"appearance\" during Game 5, where he was listed in the lineup card as starting in right field; but for his turn at bat in the top of the first inning he was replaced by a left-handed hitting Dave Robertson.\nThe White Sox, who were essentially dismantled following the 1920 season by baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis due to the Black Sox Scandal in the 1919 World Series, did not make it to another World Series until , and did not win another World Series until .\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nFred McMullin drove in Chicago's first run, and Happy Felsch's homer made it 2–0. Giants pitcher Slim Sallee knocked in his side's only run with a single after a Lew McCarty triple.\nGame 2.\nShoeless Joe Jackson's two-run single capped a five-run fourth inning for the White Sox, who knocked out Giants starter Ferdie Schupp in the second inning.\nGame 3.\nThe home team won for the third straight time as the series moved to New York. The only runs of a snappy 1 hour, 55 minute game came on a Dave Robertson triple, Walter Holke double and a single by George Burns.\nGame 4.\nThe first of a pair of homers by Giants center fielder Benny Kauff was an inside-the-park one that sailed over Sox center fielder Happy Felsch's head. The other came in the eighth off Chicago reliever Dave Danforth.\nGame 5.\nEven though Red Faber would start Games 4 and 6, he was brought in from the bullpen to close Game 5. Taking no chances, the Sox yanked starter Reb Russell after just three batters, all of whom reached base. A three-error third inning behind Eddie Cicotte put the Giants up 4–1. But after a game-tying rally in the seventh, the Sox won it in the eighth as Happy Felsch greeted reliever Pol Perritt with an RBI single. It was the fifth straight win by the home team in this Series.\nGame 6.\nA pair of errors proved costly to the Giants in a three-run fourth when Chick Gandil and Ray Schalk followed with RBI hits. New York's hopes rose with a Buck Herzog triple in the next inning that made it 3–2. But with the workhorse Faber holding the Giants at bay the rest of the way, the Sox got an insurance run in the ninth on hits by Buck Weaver and Nemo Leibold, and the Series was theirs. It would be their last championship until 2005.\nComposite box.\n1917 World Series (4–2): Chicago White Sox (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)"

        "title": "1916 World Series",
        "text": "The 1916 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1916 season. The 13th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Boston Red Sox against the National League champion Brooklyn Robins. The Red Sox won the Series four games to one, capturing their record-setting fourth World Series title. It was the first World Series meeting between the teams.\nCasey Stengel shone on offense for the Robins in the 1916 Series, but the Red Sox pitching corps ultimately proved too much for the denizens of Flatbush. The Sox's Babe Ruth pitched 13 shutout innings in Game 2, starting a consecutive scoreless innings streak that would reach 29 in . As with the Series, the Red Sox played their home games at the larger Braves Field, and it paid off as they drew a then-record 43,620 people for the final game.\nBrooklyn fielded some strong teams under their manager and namesake Wilbert Robinson in the late 1910s. The Robins, also interchangeably called the Dodgers, would win the pennant again in 1920, but the American League teams were generally stronger during that interval. It would be 39 years before the Dodgers would win their first World Series title in .\nThe two franchises met again in the postseason for the first time in 102 years in the 2018 World Series, 60 years after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles. The record for most innings played in a World Series game, set by Game 2 in 1916, at 14, was broken by Game 3 in 2018, at 18. Just like their first matchup in the World Series, the Red Sox would eventually go on to defeat the Dodgers in five games to win their ninth World Series championship overall and fourth World Series championship since 2004.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nUntil the ninth, Boston starter Ernie Shore was in control. Holding a comfortable 6–1 lead, a walk, hit batter, error and bases-loaded walk to Fred Merkle finally forced the Red Sox to call on Carl Mays from the bullpen to preserve a 6–5 win.\nGame 2.\nThe Robins scored in the top of the first on an inside-the-park home run by Hy Myers, and the Red Sox tied it in the bottom of the third, Ruth himself knocking in the run with a ground ball. The game remained 1–1 until the bottom of the 14th, when the Red Sox won it on a pinch-hit single by Del Gainer. The 14-inning game set a World Series record for longest game by innings. That mark was equaled in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros, and then again in Game 1 of the 2015 World Series between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets, before being broken in Game 3 of the 2018 World Series between the Red Sox and Dodgers.\nGame 3.\nA seventh-inning home run by Larry Gardner chased Brooklyn starter Jack Coombs and brought Boston to within one run. Jeff Pfeffer came through with innings of hitless relief to save the victory for Coombs.\nGame 4.\nBrooklyn's first three batters reached safely off Dutch Leonard in a two-run first inning, but that's all the Dodgers would get. Larry Gardner's second home run in two days was an inside-the-park one to left-center that scored two teammates ahead of him, giving Leonard all he would need for the win.\nGame 5.\nThe final game was over in a snappy 1 hour, 43 minutes. Ernie Shore threw a three-hitter. Boston scratched out a run on a walk, sacrifice bunt, ground-out and passed ball. The Red Sox added more in the third, thanks to an error and a Chick Shorten RBI single, and the fifth when Harry Hooper singled and scored on a Hal Janvrin double. Casey Stengel led off the Dodger ninth with a hit, but Shore allowed no more. For the second straight series, Red Sox pitching dominated, this time holding the Robins to a team .200 batting average, contributing to an easy 5-game victory.\nComposite line score.\n1916 World Series (4–1): Boston Red Sox (A.L.) over Brooklyn Robins (N.L.)\nSeries statistics.\nBoston Red Sox.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nBrooklyn Robins.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\""

        "text": "The 1915 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1915 season. The 12th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Boston Red Sox against the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Red Sox won the Series four games to one. It was the last World Series to start on a Friday until the 2022 World Series.\nIn their only World Series before , the Phillies won Game 1 before being swept the rest of the way. It was 65 years before the Phillies won their next Series game. The Red Sox pitching was so strong in the 1915 series that the young Babe Ruth was not used on the mound and only made a single pinch-hitting appearance.\nSeries arrangements.\nArrangements for the Series were made on October 2, 1915, in a meeting of the team owners, league presidents and the National Commission at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan, New York City. Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin lost the coin toss for home field advantage, and Phillies owner William F. Baker chose to have the first two games of the Series in Philadelphia. The league presidents selected the umpires, and it was announced that J. G. Taylor Spink would be one of the official scorers.\nOne controversy surrounded the allocation of tickets to the Red Sox' Royal Rooters fan club. Each visiting team was allocated 200 tickets, but the Red Sox requested an additional 400 on behalf of their supporters. The Phillies' Baker Bowl sat only 20,000, and their above-cited owner, William Baker, refused to allocate additional tickets for visiting fans. The matter was resolved by National Commission chairman Garry Herrmann, who gave the Red Sox tickets from the Commission's own Series allocation.\nSeries summary.\nThe Phillies won Game 1 3–1, although \"The New York Times\" reporter Hugh Fullerton wrote of the future 300+ game-winning Hall of Famer, \"[Grover Cleveland] Alexander pitched a bad game of ball. He had little or nothing\" in his review of the game, headed \"Nothing but luck saved the Phillies.\" The \"Times\" also reported that a crowd of 10,000 gathered in Manhattan's Times Square to view a real-time mechanical recreation of the game on a giant scoreboard sponsored by the newspaper.\nThe Phillies were not to win another postseason game until 1977, nor another World Series game until 1980. The Red Sox swept Games 2–5, all by one run, and by identical scores of 2–1 in Games 2–4.\nIn Game 2, Woodrow Wilson became the first U.S. President to attend a World Series game.\nThis was the second straight year that a Boston team beat a Philadelphia team in the World Series after the Braves had swept the Athletics the year before.\nUnlike the 1913 Series, where the home team won only one of the five games, home field was often very much an advantage in the 1915 October classic. Fenway Park, paradoxically the Braves' home field in their 1914 Series sweep of the A's while Braves Field was still being built, had been the home of the Red Sox for four seasons and was fully functional in 1915; yet the Red Sox played their 1915 Series \"home\" games in the brand-new Braves Field to take advantage of its larger seating capacity. Beyond the added revenue, the long ball was affected by this arrangement, as follows:\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nAlexander scattered eight hits, winning 3–1, in giving the Phillies their only win of the series and their last until Game 1 of the 1980 Series.\nGame 2.\nRube Foster pitched a 3-hitter, allowing no walks, and retiring the last 10 Phillies he faced, and helped his own cause with the game-winning RBI single in the top of the ninth.\nGame 3.\nDutch Leonard and Grover Cleveland Alexander engaged in a classic pitcher's duel, Leonard retiring the last 20 Phillies to face him, winning 2–1 on an RBI single by Duffy Lewis in the bottom of the 9th.\nGame 4.\nErnie Shore held the Phillies scoreless until the eighth inning, winning 2–1, giving the Red Sox a 3–1 series lead.\nGame 5.\nThe Red Sox won on three home runs by two of their outfielders, two cheapies by Harry Hooper (see above) and one by Duffy Lewis. Fred Luderus homered for the Phillies only home run of the series in the bottom of the fourth inning. Those were the only round-trippers in the entire Series, the first four games being pitchers' duels. The Phillies were held to a weak .182 team batting average in the 5-game set.\nComposite Line Score.\n1915 World Series (4–1): Boston Red Sox (A.L.) over Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.)\nThe winning margin of two runs remains the lowest for a five-game series, followed by three runs in 2000, and five runs in 1933, 1942, and 1974.\nSeries Statistics.\nBoston Red Sox.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\""

        "title": "1914 World Series",
        "text": "The 1914 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's 1914 season. The 11th edition of the World Series, it was played between the American League champion and defending World Series champion Philadelphia Athletics and the National League champion Boston Braves.\nThe \"Miracle Braves\" were in last place on July 4, then won the National League pennant by games. The Braves' relatively unknown starting trio of pitchers, with a combined career record of 285–245, outperformed the Athletics vaunted rotation (929–654) in all four games. Hank Gowdy hit .545 (6 of 11) with five extra-base hits and also drew five walks for Boston in the series and was the difference maker in Games 1 and 3.\nAdding to their supposed disadvantages, the Braves arguably lacked a notable home-field advantage. They had abandoned their 43-year-old home field South End Grounds in August 1914, choosing to rent from the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park while awaiting construction of Braves Field (1915). Thus their home games in this Series were also at Fenway.\nThis was the first four-game sweep in World Series history. The Cubs had defeated the Tigers four games to none in , but Game 1 had ended in a tie before the Cubs won the next four in a row.\nAt least one publication, \"To Every Thing A Season\" by Bruce Kuklick, has suggested other factors that might have contributed to the sweep, noting that some of the A's may have been irritated at the penny-pinching ways of their manager/owner Connie Mack and thus did not play hard, and also noting the heavy wagering against Philadelphia placed by entertainer George M. Cohan through bookmaker Sport Sullivan, who was also implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Chief Bender and Eddie Plank jumped to the rival Federal League for the 1915 season. Mack unloaded most of his other high-priced stars soon after and, within two years, the A's achieved the worst winning percentage in modern history (even worse than the 1962 New York Mets or the 2003 Detroit Tigers).\nBackground.\nBecause an AL team had won the last four World Series (the A's had represented the AL in three out of those four), the A's were heavily favored. That the Braves had been in last place in July before coming back to win the pennant contributed to the perception that the AL was simply superior to the NL. The A's roster boasted 5 future hall-of-famers and many agreed they were the better team on paper. A story told about Connie Mack during the 1914 season reflects this attitude among the A's that the Braves would be pushovers. That year, Mack gave star pitcher Chief Bender the week off and told him to scout the Braves personally. Instead, Bender took a vacation. When asked to defend his actions, he replied: \"Why should I check out a bunch of bush league hitters?\"\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\n26-game winner Dick Rudolph scattered five hits while striking out eight as the Braves won the opener in convincing fashion against the Athletics ace, Chief Bender. Catcher Hank Gowdy had a single, double and triple as well as a walk in leading Boston's offensive attack. He was also on the back end of a double steal in the eighth inning, with Butch Schmidt's steal of home the Braves' final run.\nAccording to Tom Meany's 1950 book \"Baseball's Greatest Teams\", with one chapter on each of the then 16 major league teams' one most outstanding season in the author's opinion, the chapter on the Boston Braves was naturally on their one world championship year, 1914. Meany recalled that manager Stallings and the Braves showed utter contempt for Connie Mack's heavily favored A's by spurning the Shibe Park visiting clubhouse for the one in the National League Phillies' deserted home park, Baker Bowl (the NL site of the next World Series, which again featured Boston defeating Philadelphia, but this time Red Sox 4, Phillies 1). Meany may also have been the source for the sensational sidelight that Stallings' motive for this may have been the rumor that the A's may have sabotaged the Shibe Park visiting clubhouse (with war clouds gathering in Europe as World War I was just beginning).\nGame 2.\nBill James, Boston's other 26-game winner, hooked up against Philadelphia's Eddie Plank in a classic pitcher's duel. James allowed only three base runners in the first eight innings, picking off two of them in holding Philadelphia scoreless. Plank matched him until the ninth, when Amos Strunk lost Charlie Deal's fly ball in the sun for a double. Deal then stole third, and scored on a two-out single by Les Mann. James walked two batters in the ninth, but got Eddie Murphy to ground into a game-ending double play to give Boston a 2–0 advantage in the series coming back home to Fenway.\nGame 3.\nLefty Tyler of the Braves went up against Bullet Joe Bush in a 12-inning thriller. Frank \"Home Run\" Baker's two-out single in the tenth plated two runs to give the Athletics a 4–2 lead and a seeming victory to get them back in the series. But Hank Gowdy led off the bottom of the tenth with a home run, and the Braves then tied the game on Joe Connolly's sacrifice fly later in the inning. Game 2 winner Bill James, coming on in relief for Boston in the 11th, earned the win after Gowdy led off the bottom of the 12th with a double and pinch-runner Les Mann scored when Bush threw wildly to third on Herbie Moran's bunt, giving the Braves a commanding 3–0 series lead.\nGame 4.\nJohnny Evers' two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the fifth broke a 1–1 tie and the collective backs of the heavily favored Athletics as the \"Miracle Braves\" completed their improbable sweep. Game 1 winner Dick Rudolph allowed only one base-runner after Evers' tie-breaking hit and struck out seven in notching his second win of the series. The powerful A's were held to a .172 team batting average and no home runs in the series.\nComposite line score.\n1914 World Series (4–0): Boston Braves (N.L.) over Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.)"

The Pirates won the Series in seven games to capture their first championship of the modern Major League Baseball era and the second championship in the club's history. This Series is best remembered for featuring two of the very best players of the time, Pittsburgh shortstop Honus Wagner, and Detroit outfielder Ty Cobb.\nSeries recap.\nSites: games 1, 2 in Pittsburgh; games 3, 4 in Detroit; game 5 in Pittsburgh; games 6, 7 in Detroit.\nThe Pirates had won the National League pennant in 1909 behind the brilliant play of Honus Wagner, who led the league with a .339 batting average and 100 runs batted in.\nDetroit returned for their third consecutive Fall Classic, determined to erase the memories of their previous efforts. The Tigers were also backed up by the heavy bat of Ty Cobb (who had just won his third consecutive American League batting title) and a formidable pitching staff. They might have finally won the Series in their third try, had it not been for Pirates rookie Babe Adams. Manager Fred Clarke started him, on a hunch, in Game 1. Adams won that game and two more, setting a World Series record for rookies. The Tigers thus became the first AL team to win three consecutive pennants and the first team to lose three straight World Series (the New York Giants would lose three straight Series from 1911 to 1913).\nThe Pirates ran at will against the weak Detroit catching corps, stealing 18 bases in seven games.\nFor the first time, four umpires were used at the same time, with the standard plate umpire and base umpire along with two outfield umpires.\nOn June 14, 2009, the series' 100th anniversary was celebrated, when the Tigers and Pirates played each other in Pittsburgh. Both teams wore throwback uniforms similar to those worn in 1909. The stadium's public address and sound systems were also turned off, simulating the game conditions in 1909. The Pirates won the game, 6–3.\nThe \"Krauthead\" story.\nTy Cobb had a fairly quiet Series, going 6-for-26 with two stolen bases and one caught stealing. There is a long-standing legend that Cobb, standing on first base, called the German-ancestored Honus Wagner a \"krauthead\", told him he was going to steal second, and was not only thrown out but that Wagner tagged him in the mouth, ball in hand, drawing blood from Cobb's lip. However, an examination of the play-by-play does not indicate that such a play occurred. In the one \"caught stealing\" charged to Cobb, during the first inning of Game 4, he was actually safe at second due to a throwing error by first baseman Bill Abstein. This story is largely attributed to the creative press at the time, and Wagner and Cobb were actually on good terms.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nRookie Babe Adams, who had compiled a 12–3 record during the regular season, unexpectedly drew the start for Game 1. He responded with a six-hit, 4–1 victory sparked by Clarke's game-tying home run in the bottom of the fourth inning.\nGame 2.\nThe Tigers began their 7–2 comeback win (after a two-run Pirate bottom of the first) with three runs in the top of the third, tying the Series at one game apiece. Ty Cobb stole home to start the rally.\nGame 3.\nHonus Wagner had three hits, three RBI and three stolen bases as the Pirates regained the lead in the Series, two games to one.\nGame 4.\nThe win-swapping continued with Detroit taking Game 4. Tiger ace George Mullin threw a five-hit shutout while striking out 10 Pirates, again evening the Series at two games apiece.\nGame 5.\nBabe Adams threw another six-hitter, for an 8–4 triumph and a 3–2 Series lead for his Pirates.\nGame 6.\nMullin, after being roughed up for three first-inning runs, surrendered only one more and wound up with the win, knotting the Series at three games apiece.\nGame 7.\nWith the Series coming down to a climactic seventh game (the first to go the distance), Pittsburgh's Fred Clarke went with two-game winner Babe Adams as his pitcher, while Detroit Manager Hugh Jennings decided on Bill Donovan, a complete-game winner in Game 2.\nDonovan got off to a miserable start. He hit the first Pirate batter and went on to walk six in the first two innings. He was pulled after three with Adams confidently holding a 2–0 lead. Pittsburgh never looked back, as Babe nailed his third six-hitter and third win of the Series for an 8–0 championship victory.\nHonus Wagner continued to prove his Cooperstown worthiness by hitting .333, with seven RBI and six stolen bases (the latter total standing as a Series record until Lou Brock surpassed it in ). On the other side, Ty Cobb did not fare as well. Appearing in what would be his last Series (although he would remain active through 1928), Cobb batted only .231 although he did lead the Tigers, losers of their third Series in three years, with six RBI.\nNo two professional sports teams from Detroit and Pittsburgh would meet in a postseason game again until Game 1 of the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals between the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins.\nIt was the first time that one team won the odd-numbered games; the other, the even; it did not happen again until .\nComposite line score.\n1909 World Series (4–3): Pittsburgh Pirates (N.L.) beat Detroit Tigers (A.L.)\nFilm coverage.\nThe championship was recorded by Essanay Co., and sold double the expected number of copies. Studio manager A. M. Kennedy speculated that the film would set a world record for sales."

        "text": "The 1908 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1908 season. The fifth edition of the World Series, it matched the defending National League champion Chicago Cubs against the American League champion Detroit Tigers in a rematch of the 1907 Series. In this first-ever rematch of this young event, the Cubs won in five games for their second straight World Series title.\nThe 1908 World Series was significant for being the last World Series championship the Cubs would win until (108 years later). That became the longest World Series victory drought in MLB history. Before the 2016 series, the team would go on to appear in seven World Series; in , , , , , , and , losing each time. The Cubs had been one of baseball's most dominant teams in the early 1900s. This was the year of the infamous \"Merkle's Boner\" play that allowed the Chicago Cubs to reach the World Series after beating the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants) in a one-game \"playoff\", actually the makeup game for the tie that the Merkle play had caused.\nThe Series was anticlimactic after tight pennant races in both leagues. Ty Cobb had a much better World Series than in the previous year, as did the rest of his team. The final two games, held in Detroit, were shutouts. This was also the most poorly attended World Series in history, with the final game drawing a record-low 6,210 fans. Attendance in Chicago was harmed by a ticket-scalping scheme that fans accused the club's owner of participating in, and the World Series was boycotted to some degree.\nFor the first time, four umpires were used in the series, in alternating two-man teams. Games 1, 4, and 5 were played in Detroit, while Games 2 and 3 were played in Chicago. Had the series continued, Game 6 would have been played in Chicago, and the home team for Game 7 would have been decided randomly, \"by lot\".\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Tigers struck first in Game 1 when Matty McIntyre singled to lead off the bottom of the first off of Ed Reulbach, stole second and scored on Ty Cobb's two-out single, but the Cubs responded in the third off of Ed Killian when after a leadoff double and single, Frank Schulte's RBI single tied the game. After a bunt groundout, Harry Steinfeldt's RBI single put Chicago up 2–1. After a walk, Ed Summers relieved Killian and allowed an RBI groundout to Joe Tinker and Johnny Kling reached on an error that allowed another run to score. The Cubs added another run in the seventh on Steinfedlt's sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the inning, with runners on second and third, Boss Schmidt's groundout, Red Downs's ground-rule double, and Summers's single scored a run each. Next inning, Claude Rossman's two-run single off of Mordecai Brown put the Tigers up 6–5. In the top of the ninth, three straight one-out singles loaded the bases before Solly Hofman's single scored two and Joe Tinker's bunt single scored another. After a double steal, Johnny King's two-run single put the Cubs up 10–6. Brown pitched a scoreless bottom of the ninth despite allowing a single and walk as the Cubs went up 1–0 in the series.\nGame 2.\nA scoreless tie in the bottom of the eighth came to an end when Joe Tinker's two-run homer launched a six-run Cub outburst. After a ground-rule double and groundout, RBI singles by Jimmy Sheckard and Johnny Evers and an RBI triple by Frank Schulte (the last two hits coming off after stolen bases) scored a run each. A wild pitch to Frank Chance scored the Cubs' last run. The Tigers avoided a shutout in the ninth when Davy Jones drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Ty Cobb's single. Orval Overall's complete-game win took just 90 minutes.\nGame 3.\nIt was in this game that Ty Cobb enjoyed the finest World Series outing he ever had. The 21-year-old Georgian rapped three singles and a double in five at-bats, and stole two bases. In the top of the ninth, he singled and promptly stole second and third, but then the hyped-up boy wonder pressed his luck and was thrown out trying to steal home. This was the only Tiger win in their back-to-back first two World Series losses to the Cubs. Detroit struck first in the top of the first when Charley O'Leary hit a one-out single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Ty Cobb's single. The Cubs responded in the fourth on Frank Chance's RBI single. After stealing second, an error on Harry Steinfeldt's ground ball and Solly Hofman's triple scored a run each. In the top of the sixth, after a single and walk, singles by Sam Crawford, Ty Cobb, and Claude Rossman scored a run each. After a double play, Ira Thomas's RBI double made it 6–3 Tigers. They added two more runs in the eighth on Bill Coughlin's bases loaded sacrifice fly followed by George Mullin's RBI single.\nGame 4.\nThis one was over in 1 hour and 35 minutes. RBI singles by Harry Steinfeldt and Solly Hofman in the third inning after two walks gave Mordecai Brown all the support he'd need. Brown allowed only four hits and walked none. The Cubs added another run in the ninth when Frank Chance reached on an error with two on.\nGame 5.\nIn the first inning, Overall registered four strikeouts, as Claude Rossman reached on an uncaught third strike. This was the first, and to date only, instance of a four-strikeout inning in a World Series game. Overall allowed only three hits, walking four and striking out 10 for his second win of the series. In innings pitched during the series, he allowed only seven hits and two runs for an ERA of 0.98.\nThe Cubs scored the game's first run in the first on three straight one-out singles, the last of which to Frank Chance scoring a run, then added another run in the fifth on Johnny Evers's double after two walks.\nBoss Schmidt, who made the last out of the 1907 Series with a popup to short, also made the last out of this Series with a feeble catcher-to-first groundout.\nThis was also the first World Series game in which neither team committed an error. The Cubs did not win another World Series title until finally reclaiming the crown in , a drought of 108 years, which remains the longest in MLB history.\nThe attendance during this final game of the series, 6,210, was the smallest crowd in World Series history. It also remains the fastest postseason game in major-league history, at 1 hour 25 minutes.\nComposite line score.\n1908 World Series (4–1): Chicago Cubs (N.L.) over Detroit Tigers (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1907 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1907 season. The fourth edition of the World Series, it featured the defending National League champion Chicago Cubs and the American League champion Detroit Tigers. The Cubs won the Series four games to none (with one tie) for their first championship.\nThe series had been scheduled for two games in Chicago, three games in Detroit, and one game in Chicago (games beyond the first four, only if necessary). Had a seventh game been necessary, its location was to be decided by the league office. After the first game ended in a tie, the series did not move to Detroit until Game 4.\nThe Cubs came back strong from their shocking loss in the 1906 World Series. The Tigers' young star Ty Cobb came into the Series with the first of his many league batting championships. With pitching dominance over the Tigers and Cobb, the Cubs allowed only three runs in the four games they won, while stealing 18 bases off the rattled Tigers.\nEach game was umpired by the two-man crew of Hank O'Day and Jack Sheridan.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Tigers scored three runs, largely due to three Cub errors, in the eighth inning and held a 3–1 lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning. The Cubs loaded the bases on a single, walk and infield error with one out. Detroit conceded a run on a ground ball for the second out, and Cub player-manager Frank Chance then pinch hit Del Howard for Joe Tinker. Wild Bill Donovan (25–4 in the regular season) struck him out, but the ball got away from catcher Boss Schmidt, allowing Harry Steinfeldt to score the tying run. Donovan got the next hitter, but the damage had been done. The teams then played three scoreless extra innings before the game was called on account of darkness and declared a tie, a World Series first.\nDonovan struck out 12 Cubs in the game. Although that matched Ed Walsh's total in Game 3 against the Cubs in 1906, Walsh had done so in nine innings while Donovan only struck out 10 batters in the first nine innings of the game.\nThis was the closest the Tigers came to winning a game in this, their first Series. The Cubs committed five errors and struck out 12 times in the game, but nine stolen base attempts (seven successful) and five bunts (two for hits) set an aggressive offensive tone pressuring the Tigers for the rest of the series.\nGame 2.\nGeorge Mullin, who both won and lost 20 games for Detroit in the regular season, and who had walked over 100 batters in each of his last five seasons, issued a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the second, matching the Tiger run in the top of the inning and tying the score at 1–1. Chicago scored two more in the fourth on a single, sacrifice bunt, RBI single, stolen base and double to take a 3–1 lead. Jack Pfiester, while allowing ten hits, benefited from two double plays and three caught-stealings by battery-mate Johnny Kling and was the winning pitcher for the Cubs. Joe Tinker scored a run and drove in another in Game 2 after being pinch-hit for in the ninth inning of Game 1.\nHughie Jennings was the recipient of the first ejection issued in World Series history when he argued a caught stealing call by Hank O'Day against Germany Schaefer.\nGame 3.\nCub pitcher Ed Reulbach scattered six hits as Chicago jumped on Tiger starter Ed Siever for four runs on seven hits in only four innings en route to their second win. Johnny Evers had three hits, including two doubles, as the Cubs took a 2–0 lead in the Series.\nGame 4.\nIn their first World Series home game, the Tigers took a 1–0 lead on a triple by their 20-year-old batting champion Ty Cobb and an RBI single by Claude Rossman in the bottom of the fourth, shortly before a rain delay in the top of the fifth. Soon after play resumed in the same inning, two Cubs reached base on an error and a walk. After Joe Tinker sacrificed, pitcher Orval Overall drove both runners home on a single to right. The Cubs scored three more in the seventh without the ball leaving the infield, on four bunts (two for hits) and two ground balls. Regular-season 23-game winner Overall was masterful after the rain delay, allowing only one hit in Detroit's final five innings, giving his Cubs a commanding 3–0 lead in the Series.\nGame 5.\nChicago wrapped up the series with a 2–0 victory on \"Three-fingered\" Mordecai Brown's seven-hit shutout. The Cubs scored a run in the top of the first on a walk, stolen base and RBI single by Harry Steinfeldt and scored again in the second on an error, a single, a double-steal and a groundout to drive in the last run of the Series. Detroit had runners on second and third with one out in the last of the fourth, but left them there and never seriously threatened after that.\nThis Series was the closest to a four-game sweep until the first true Series sweep in , when George Stallings' \"miracle\" Boston Braves surged from last place in mid-July to win the NL pennant and upset Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics in the Series.\nFrank Chance remains, at 30, the youngest manager to win a World Series title, breaking the mark set by John McGraw who won the 1905 World Series with the New York Giants at the age of 32. Since then only one other manager has won a World Series under the age of 40, Tom Kelly of the Minnesota Twins won the 1987 World Series at the age of 37.\nComposite line score.\n1907 World Series (4–0–1): Chicago Cubs (N.L.) over Detroit Tigers (A.L.)"

        "text": "The 1906 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1906 season. The third edition of the World Series, it featured a crosstown matchup between the American League champion Chicago White Sox and the National League champion Chicago Cubs. The Cubs had posted the highest regular-season win total (116) and winning percentage (.763) in the major leagues since the advent of the 154-game season. The White Sox, known as the \"Hitless Wonders\" after finishing with the worst team batting average (.230) in the American League, beat the Cubs in six games for one of the greatest upsets in Series history as the Sox out-pitched the Cubs in their first two wins and out-hit them in their last two. The home teams alternated, starting with the National League Cubs being home in Game 1.\nThe teams split the first four games; then the Hitless Wonders (a name coined by sportswriter Charles Dryden) exploded for 26 hits in the last two games. True to their nickname, the White Sox hit only .198 as a team in winning the series, but it beat the .196 average produced by the Cubs. In Game 3, White Sox pitcher Ed Walsh struck out 12 Cubs, breaking the previous record of 11 set by Bill Dinneen in .\nThe 1906 World Series was the first to be played between two teams from the same city. This series and the edition, contested between the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns, are the only such instances outside of New York City. This is also the most recent World Series where both teams were making their first appearance in the Fall Classic.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nWhite Sox starter Nick Altrock faced Cub starter Mordecai \"Three-Fingered\" Brown in game 1. Both were perfect through three innings. The Cubs put a runner on second in the bottom of the fourth inning, but couldn't score. In the top of the fifth, George Rohe tripled to lead off, then scored on an error at home when Patsy Dougherty reached on a fielder's choice. The Sox scored a second run in the top of the sixth. Altrock walked, and was sacrificed to second base by Ed Hahn. Fielder Jones then singled to center but Altrock was thrown out at the plate, Jones taking second on the throw home. He took third on Cub catcher Johnny Kling's passed ball, and Frank Isbell drove him home with a single. The Cubs struck back in their half of the sixth. Kling walked and Brown singled with nobody out. After Solly Hofman sacrificed the runners to second and third, Altrock's wild pitch scored Kling and sent Brown to third, giving him little margin for error with only one out, but he got Jimmy Sheckard to pop out and Frank Schulte to ground out to end the threat. He pitched beautifully for the rest of the game, allowing only one more Cub to reach second, retaining the 2–1 lead for a Game 1 Sox win.\nGame 2.\nEd Reulbach was called on for the Cubs to face White Sox hurler Doc White. After matching 1–2–3 first innings, things started to fall apart for White. After cleanup-hitting first baseman Frank Chance led off the top of the second with a strikeout, third baseman Harry Steinfeldt singled to left field and shortstop Joe Tinker beat out a bunt. Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers then reached on a two-base error by White Sox second baseman Frank Isbell, scoring Steinfeldt for an unearned run and moving Tinker and Evers to second and third. Catcher Johnny Kling was then intentionally walked to load the bases and bring up the pitcher, still with only one out. Reulbach squeeze-bunted Tinker home for a second unearned run, moving Evers to third and Kling to second with two out. Solly Hofman followed with an infield single to shortstop Lee Tannehill, scoring Evers for a third unearned run, but when Kling tried to score from second, he was thrown out at home plate, ending the rally. The Cubs added a fourth unearned run in the third, ending Doc White's day on the mound. The Sox scored in the bottom of the fifth inning with an unearned run, thanks to a wild pitch and an error. The Cubs scored three more runs, all earned, in the sixth and eighth to win Game 2 7–1 and tie the Series at one game apiece. Reulbach pitched the first one-hitter in World Series history.\nGame 3.\nAfter allowing two first-inning hits, Sox starter \"Big Ed\" Walsh didn't give up another and struck out 12, giving the Sox a 2–1 edge in the series. After Fred Schulte's first inning two-out double, Walsh retired the next 25 of 27 Cub batters to face him. Third baseman George Rohe cracked a two-out, bases-loaded triple to left in the top of the sixth off Jack Pfiester for the only runs of the game.\nGame 4.\nLooking to even the Series, the Cubs started Mordecai Brown on one day's rest who pitched innings of no-hit ball for the Cubs before settling for a two-hitter. Nick Altrock, who faced and defeated Brown in game 1, was the hard-luck loser, with the only run of the game coming on Johnny Evers' two-out single in the top of the seventh scoring Frank Chance. The Sox put the tying run on second base in the top of the ninth thanks to a two-out walk and a passed ball, but Frank Isbell grounded out to end the threat. The game took just 96 minutes and evened the Series at two games apiece.\nGame 5.\nGame 5 was a wild affair with a total of 18 hits, ten walks, six errors, two hit batsmen, three wild pitches and a steal of home. The Cubs allowed a first inning run to the Sox, then scored three unearned runs on two Sox errors to take an early lead. The Sox tied the game in the third on George Davis' theft of home on the front end of a double steal and then took the lead for good with a four-run rally in the fourth and held on for the victory to take a 3–2 lead in the series. A 12-hit attack led by Frank Isbell's four doubles were enough to overcome seven unearned runs by the Cubs caused by six errors committed by the normally solid Sox defense. \"Big\" Ed Walsh earned his second win of the series, although he needed three innings of relief help from Doc White.\nGame 6.\nMordecai Brown, again pitching on only one day of rest, didn't make it out of the second inning as the Hitless Wonders White Sox stunned the 116–36 Cubs in the Series finale. The Sox battered Brown for seven runs on eight hits while getting a solid pitching performance from Doc White. Although the Cubs scored a run and loaded the bases in the ninth, White got Frank Schulte to ground out for the final out of the series and the White Sox won the World Series.\nThe powerful Cubs went on to win the next two World Series from the Detroit Tigers, despite falling far short of 116 wins in either season, for the last Cubs win in a World Series for over a hundred years.\nThis game remains the only time the Chicago White Sox have clinched a postseason series in their home ballpark. It was the only time a Chicago-based team had ever clinched a series at home until the Cubs won the 2015 National League Division Series on their home field.\nComposite line score.\n1906 World Series (4–2): Chicago White Sox (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)"

        "title": "Radio Golf",
        "text": "Radio Golf is a play by American playwright, August Wilson, the final installment in his ten-part series, \"The Century Cycle\". It was first performed in 2005 by the Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut and had its Broadway premiere in 2007 at the Cort Theatre. It is Wilson's final work.\nPlot.\nHarmond Wilks, an Ivy League-educated man who has inherited a real estate agency from his father, his ambitious wife Mame, and his friend Roosevelt Hicks want to redevelop the Hill District in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The project, called the Bedford Hills Redevelopment Project, includes two high-rise apartment buildings and high-end chain stores like Starbucks, Whole Foods, and Barnes &amp; Noble. Harmond is also about to declare his candidacy to be Pittsburgh's first black mayor. Roosevelt has just been named a vice-president of Mellon Bank and has been tapped by a Bernie Smith to help him acquire a local radio station at less than market value, which is possible through a minority tax incentive.\nA complication arises when Harmond discovers that the house at 1839 Wylie, slated for demolition, was acquired illegally. Harmond offers the owner of the property market value for the house, but the owner refuses to sell. Harmond decides the only way to proceed is to build around the house, which will require minor modifications to the planned development, and calls the demolition company to cancel the demolition. Roosevelt sees no reason to delay since no one but Harmond, Roosevelt, Mame, and the house's owner know the truth, a view Mame supports. When, on the day of the demolition, which Roosevelt has put back into motion, Harmond refuses to be swayed from his stand, Roosevelt announces he will be buying Harmond out and Bernie Smith will be helping him. Harmond accuses Roosevelt of being Smith's \"black face\" and the two argue over the consequences of Harmond demanding changes in the development plans and if Roosevelt is allowing himself to be used by Bernie Smith. Harmond tells Roosevelt to leave the Bedford Hills Redevelopment office, which is owned by Wilks Realty. The scene ends with Harmond leaving the office to join the group of Hill residents at 1839 Wylie protesting the demolition.\nProductions.\nThe world premiere of \"Radio Golf\" was at the Yale Repertory Theatre from April 22 to May 14, 2005; it was then presented on the West Coast by the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, California, in August 2005. The Yale production was directed by Timothy Douglas. Kenny Leon directed the production at the Mark Taper Forum. It next played at the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston, Massachusetts, in October 2006, and the McCarter Theatre in 2007. The play was performed at the Tricycle Theatre in London, UK between 2 October and 1 November 2008.\nThe play opened on Broadway at the Cort Theatre on May 8, 2007, and closed on July 1, 2007, after 64 performances and 17 previews. Directed by Kenny Leon, the cast featured Anthony Chisholm (Elder Joseph Barlow), John Earl Jelks (Sterling Johnson), Harry Lennix (Harmond Wilks), Tonya Pinkins (Mame Wilks), and James A. Williams (Roosevelt Hicks).\nThe Cort Theatre was also the venue where Wilson's first Broadway play, \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\", opened in 1984. Chicago's Goodman Theatre is the first to mount a production of the complete ten play \"The Pittsburgh Cycle\" with the closing of \"Radio Golf\" in early 2007. The St. Louis Black Repertory Theatre's production of \"Radio Golf\" opened in Feb., 2008. The Studio Theatre in Washington, D.C., produced the play, opening May 20, 2009. The Denver Center Theatre Company also produced the play in April 2009, and was the first theatre company to stage all ten plays of \"The Pittsburgh Cycle\" under one director, Israel Hicks. Geva Theatre Center in Rochester, New York produced the play in March 2011 and is the first theatre to produce all ten plays in decade order as \"August Wilson's American Century.\"\nThe Broadway producers were Jujamcyn Theaters, Margo Lion, Jeffrey Richards/Jerry Frankel, Tamara Tunie/Wendell Pierce, Fran Kirmser, Bunting Management Group, George Frontiere and Open Pictures, Lauren Doll/Steven Greil &amp; The August Wilson Group, Wondercity Inc., Townsend Teague, Jack Viertel, Gordon Davidson."

        "text": "The men's ice hockey tournament at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, United States, was the 14th Olympic Championship. Twelve teams competed in the tournament, which was held from February 12 to 24, 1980. The United States won its second gold medal, including a win over the heavily favored Soviet Union that became known as the held at the Olympic Fieldhouse (8,000) and the Olympic Arena (2,500).\nFormat.\nThe IIHF ceased running a World championship in Olympic years. Nations that did not participate in the Lake Placid Olympics were invited to compete in the inaugural Thayer Tutt Trophy in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.\nGoing into the games, the teams were ranked and divided into two groups. Teams were ranked based on performance during the 1979 World Ice Hockey Championships. Included were the eight teams in the 1979 top Championship Division (Pool \"A\") as well as the top four teams in the 1979, second-tier, \"B\" Pool tournament. While Poland finished 8th place in Pool A, the Netherlands, winners of Pool B, were ranked 8th while Poland was ranked 9th going into the Olympics. The total ranking was: Soviet Union (1), Czechoslovakia (2), Sweden (3), Canada (4), Finland (5), West Germany (6), United States (7), Netherlands (8), Poland (9), Romania (10), Norway (11), Japan (12). East Germany was originally ranked tenth, but declined to participate, with Japan filling their spot.\nOverview.\nThe Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more in Lake Placid. The team consisted primarily of professional players with significant experience in international play. By contrast, the United States' team—led by head coach Herb Brooks—consisted exclusively of amateur players, and was the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history. In the group stage, both the Soviet and U.S. teams were unbeaten; the U.S. achieved several notable results, including a 2–2 draw against Sweden, and a 7–3 upset victory over second-place favorites Czechoslovakia.\nFor the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2–2, and the Soviets leading 3–2 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead during the third and final period, winning the game 4–3. Following the game, the U.S. went on to clinch the gold medal by beating Finland in their last game. The Soviet Union took the silver medal by beating Sweden.\nThe victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports. Equally well-known was the television call of the final seconds of the game by Al Michaels for ABC, in which he declared: \"Do you believe in miracles?! YES!\" In 1999, \"Sports Illustrated\" named the \"Miracle on Ice\" the top sports moment of the 20th century. As part of its centennial celebration in 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) named the \"Miracle on Ice\" as the best international ice hockey story of the past 100 years.\nConsolation round.\nThe third-placed teams in each division played each other to determine fifth place.\nFinal round.\nThe top two teams from each group play the top two teams from the other group once. Points from previous games against their own group carry over, excluding teams who failed to make the medal round. First place team wins gold, second silver, and third bronze.\nHead-to-head results carried forward from group matches:\nFinal round matches:\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nTeam Japan was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 30 years. Gold medalists team USA was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 22 years and 5 months. Silver medalists team USSR averaged 26 years and 5 months. Tournament average was 25 years and 5 months.\nLeading scorers.\nHat trick scorers\nLeading goaltenders.\n\"Goaltenders with 40% or more of their team's total minutes.\"\nShutouts"

        "text": "Kathryn Elizabeth Douglas (born May 7, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player. Her primary position was shooting guard, her secondary was small forward. She was known league-wide as one of the most prominent two-way players for her long-range shooting and high scoring abilities on offense as well as her defensive abilities.\nIn the WNBA, she has been a multiple time WNBA All-Star and has been a selection to both the All-WNBA Team and WNBA All-Defensive First Team. She won WNBA Championship with the Indiana Fever in 2012. In 2023, she was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.\nCollege years.\nAfter attending Perry Meridian High School in Indianapolis, Douglas attended Purdue University and graduated in 2001 as a communications major. She helped lead Purdue to an NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship in 1999 and was a two-time Kodak All-America in 2000 and 2001, as well as being named to the 1999 and 2001 NCAA Women's Final Four All-Tournament Team. She shared Big Ten Conference Player of the Year honors in 2000 with Helen Darling, and in 2001 was the unanimous Big Ten Player of the Year and winner of the Silver Basketball from the \"Chicago Tribune\". Douglas also received the 2001 Big Ten Conference Suzy Favor Award, which is given to the conference's female athlete of the year across all sports. Douglas played at Purdue for head coach Carolyn Peck.\nPurdue statistics.\nSource\nUSA Basketball.\nDouglas played on the team presenting the US at the 1999 World University Games held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The team had a 4–2 record and earned the silver medal. Douglas was the leading scorer on the USA team with 17.6 points per game.\nWNBA career.\nDouglas was selected the 10th overall pick by the Orlando Miracle in the 2001 WNBA draft. She remained with the franchise even when the Miracle relocated to Uncasville, Connecticut, and was renamed the Connecticut Sun prior to the 2003 season. Before becoming an all-star in the league, Douglas earned some WNBA Finals experience early in her career while the Connecticut Sun were championship contenders in both the 2004 and 2005 seasons. The Sun made it to the finals in both seasons but would lose both times to the Seattle Storm and Sacramento Monarchs respectively. Following the 2005 WNBA season, Douglas had a breakout year in 2006, averaging 16.4 ppg and being voted as a WNBA all-star for the first time. Douglas was named to the WNBA All-Defensive First Team and received the Most Valuable Player award in the 2006 WNBA All-Star Game.\nIn 2007, Douglas ranked 5th in the league in steals (65), 7th in scoring (577), and 12th in assists (125). Douglas was again selected for the WNBA All-Defensive First Team.\nOn February 19, 2008, the Connecticut Sun traded Douglas to her hometown team, the Indiana Fever for Tamika Whitmore and the Fever's first round pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft, she would play alongside superstar small forward Tamika Catchings. She would have a solid season in her first year with the team by averaging 15.6 ppg, but unexpectedly struggled in the playoffs, averaging only 7.3 ppg. The Fever had gotten eliminated in the first round 2-1 by the Detroit Shock. In the 2009 season, Douglas would have the best season of her career, she had back-to-back 30+ point games, becoming the first player in franchise history to do so. She also scored a career high and franchise record, 34 points in a regular season game win against the Washington Mystics and averaged a career-high 17.6 ppg. Douglas would be voted into the 2009 WNBA All-Star Game. The Fever would make it to the finals that year, but lost 3–2 to the Phoenix Mercury. A few seasons later, Douglas would win her first WNBA Championship with the Indiana Fever in 2012 as they had beat the Minnesota Lynx 3–1. It was her fourth career WNBA Finals appearance, although she was sidelined for the series after sustaining an ankle injury during the Eastern Conference Finals. With a few seconds left in the final game of the series at home and the Fever with a comfortable lead, Douglas was subbed in while the crowd was giving a standing ovation. En route to her first championship, Douglas had another great year during the 2012 season, averaging 16.5 ppg. In a regular season game win against the Atlanta Dream, Douglas scored 29 points along with a franchise-record 7 three-pointers.\nDouglas wouldn't see much playing time in the 2013 season, missing a huge bulk of the season due to a lower back injury and playing a total of only 4 games. The injury would also cause her to miss the playoffs. This season would be Douglas's last season with the Fever as she became an unrestricted free agent.\nOn March 24, 2014, Douglas returned to the Connecticut Sun in free agency, signing a 2-year deal with a third-year option. She had another productive season averaging 13.1 ppg and was voted into the WNBA all-star game for the fifth time in her career. Despite her stats, the Sun finished last place in the Eastern Conference.\nOn May 1, 2015, Douglas announced her retirement after 14 seasons in the WNBA.\nAmong the WNBA all-time leaders, Douglas ranks 16th in regular season scoring, 6th in regular season 3-pointers made, 5th in regular season steals, 10th in playoff scoring, 4th in playoff 3-pointers made and 4th in playoff steals.\nOverseas career.\nFrom her second year to her thirteenth year in the WNBA, Douglas played overseas every off-season. Douglas went to Greece to play for Ano Liosia Basketball in the 2002-03 off-season. Douglas played in Greece once again for S.U. Glyfada Esperides Kyklos the following off-season. From 2004 to 2007, Douglas played three off-seasons in Lithuania for Lietuvos telekomas / TEO Vilnius. In the 2007-08 off-season, Douglas played for Ros Casares Valencia of the Spanish League. In the 2008-09 off-season, Douglas played for CSKA Moscow before the team folded the same year. Douglas played for Galatasaray of the Turkish League during the 2009-10 off-season with then Indiana Fever teammate Tamika Catchings. Douglas returned to Spain to play once again for Ros Casares Valencia in the 2010-11 off-season. In the 2011-12 off-season, Douglas played for Nadezhda Orenburg in the Russian League and finished off her overseas career playing in Poland for WBC Wisła Kraków in the 2012-13 off-season.\nPersonal life.\nDouglas lost both her parents to cancer; her father in 1997 and her mother less than three years later in 2000. She was awarded the first-ever Jim V Foundation Comeback of the Year Award in 2001 for her perseverance after a string of tragic, personal losses.\nOne week after the 2005 WNBA Finals loss to the Sacramento Monarchs, Douglas married Vasilis Giapalakis in Athens, Greece. Giapalakis is a sports agent who represents male and female basketball players. Douglas, who played for a Lithuanian basketball team in the WNBA offseason, met Giapalakis when she was playing for a Greek club. The couple divorced a few years later.\nIn July 2015, just a couple months after her retirement, Douglas married Fred Poe, who is an owner of a fence company named K &amp; K Fence Co. Douglas and her husband have a second in home in Fort Myers, Florida.\nBusiness ventures.\nIn 2017, Douglas opened an Orangetheory Fitness franchise fitness center in Greenwood, Indiana."

        "title": "Bowling pin shooting",
        "text": "Bowling pin shooting is a shooting sport (primarily for handguns) in which the competitors race against one another to knock standard bowling pins from a table in the shortest elapsed time. Pin shooting is often described as one of the most enjoyable shooting games and one of the easiest means of introducing a new shooter into regular competitive shooting. Pin shooting appeals to both genders. There are many female pin shooters and many distinguished female pin shooters.\nHistory.\nMassad Ayoob credits the origin of bowling pin shooting with Richard Davis in the mid-1970s. The sport peaked in popularity between the mid-1980s and the late 1990s.\nRules.\nDepending on the caliber of handgun used and the table employed, the pins must be knocked backwards up to to be knocked clear of the table and onto the ground. The pin shooting tables typically consist of one of the following varieties:\nTargets used can vary, but are usually tenpin bowling pins. Steel targets or electronic targets are also sometimes used.\nPin shooting is conducted with both revolvers and semi-automatic pistols in calibers ranging from .22 Long Rifle to .500 S&amp;W Magnum, among many others. Bowling pin competition is often recognized to be a big-bore event in which large caliber or high-power handguns such as the .38 Super, .357 Magnum, 10mm Auto, .41 Magnum, .44 Magnum, .45 ACP, and .45 Colt. Other large-bore handguns have the greatest advantage in removing the pins from the table. Frequently, no allowance is made for shooters who shoot lower-power handguns, though some range officers may permit the distance to the back of the table be reduced to for \"minor\" calibers like 9mm Luger and .38 Special so that these \"minor\" calibers can approximate head-to-head equivalency with \"major\" calibers. While handloaded ammunition is regularly employed among pin shooters, it is considered a serious breach of etiquette and sportsmanship for a shooter of a \"minor\" caliber to handload \"minor\" ammunition to levels approaching \"major\" calibers, thus taking unfair advantage of a rule intended to allow novice shooters to participate. Shooters who shoot \"hot\" \"minor\" ammunition should declare such to the range officer and shoot targets from the regular pin placement.\nSome ranges conduct centerfire handgun competition based on class. When classes are employed, three classes often are recognized: revolver, stock, and pin gun. Magazine capacity may be limited to 8 rounds in most competitions in which magazine-fed guns compete only against magazine-fed guns. In events where revolvers compete with magazine-fed guns, magazines are restricted to seven shots, out of respect for the customary six-shot revolver cylinder. The \"pin gun class\" is for highly advanced, often very expensive \"race guns\" in which almost all manner of enhancement is allowed, including optical sights (generally red dot sights) and compensators.\nzz\nThe pins are placed far enough away from each other that they are unlikely to interact when hit, so a separate shot is needed to down each pin. The broad spacing and different levels make it challenging to move from target to target. Indirect hits will result in pins lying on their sides on the table in a situation known as \"deadwood,\" where multiple shots may be required to clear the pin from the table. \"Deadwood\" is further complicated in that one deadwood pin may be lying next to another deadwood pin, interfering with a clear path to knocking either deadwood pin from the table.\nGenerally, .22 Long Rifle competitions shoot the tops of the pins, known as \"pin-tops,\" which are lighter and more easily knocked down by the light, comparatively low energy bullets. Occasionally, a .22 match may be shot by placing pins at the very back of the table so that the comparatively light .22 hit will still knock the pin off the table. Some matches are also shot with a semi-automatic or pump-action shotgun, usually firing buckshot. As shotgun rounds quickly disintegrate the pins, such matches are customarily reserved for the end of a match, when a supply of pins unfit for handgun matches may be put to final utility. There are even less common types of matches that allow carbines or submachine guns.\nTypes of competition.\nBracket-style: \"Bracket-style\" is shot in pairs of shooters. Each shooter will have his or her own table of pins, and the winner of the round is the shooter whose entire obligation of pins hits the ground first. Pins that are merely in flight do not count until they hit the ground. It is similar to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, in which shooters are paired against one another, with the round winner advancing to the next level, until an overall match winner is determined. Matches conducted along such lines are tremendously exciting, as a top shooter may fumble, pause or have a momentary equipment failure, allowing a lesser shooter to claim the round. \"Bracket-style\" competitions often contain a concurrent \"losers' bracket,\" where the losers in the \"winners' bracket\" compete for a lesser bracket win. \"Bracket style\" has sometimes been referred to as a \"gun drag race\".\nTimed: Some ranges conduct matches in a timed format, where a shooter clears three tables in an observed time, and the averages of the three tables are computed in a simple mean. The shooter with the overall fastest average wins the match.\nKing of the Hill: Two shooters conduct a round. The winner shoots against a new shooter, though a sixth pin is added to the winner's table, while the challenger shoots the regular five pins. If the winner takes the subsequent round, a seventh pin is added to the winner's table, until such time as a challenger will be able to clear five pins than the King's ever-growing allotment. When the King of the Hill is beaten, the challenger becomes the new King, and a sixth pin is added, and the round continues until the participants arrive at a stopping point. Magazine restrictions are typically removed for King of the Hill matches.\nThe pins.\nBowling pins are often discarded by bowling alleys after a certain amount of use, at which time pin shooters collect them for use in pin shooting. Modern plastic coated bowling pins are very resilient, and can absorb many rounds before becoming too splintered or unbalanced to function as targets. Generally pins start out as targets for the centerfire handguns, then when they start to disintegrate they are saved for use as shotgun targets.\nAt the start of the event, or when a fresh pin is introduced, a smaller-caliber handgun may be able to remove a pin with comparable authority as a large-bore handgun. As rounds are shot, however, the pins will add weight, as the pins become filled with lead bullets. When the pins add weight, smaller-caliber handguns suffer a great disadvantage, as the smaller round loses ability to move the pin, while the large-bore guns are easily able to clear a bullet-laden pin from the table with speed and authority.\nPins that will no longer stand on their bases have their heads sawed off down to become rimfire targets for the .22 match, where the \"pin tops\" are engaged by the shooter. Given the very light weight of the \"pin top,\" the .22 is quite capable of removing the target from the table with a single well-placed shot.\nThe goal of pin shooting.\nPin shooting is competitive, practical shooting that sharpens one’s handgun skills under time pressure. While winning is the ultimate goal and obviously rewarding, all pin shooters can expect an event that will improve their skills in the company of fellow shooters who are supportive."

        "title": "Shoot boxing",
        "text": " is both a combat sport and a stand-up fighting promotion company based in Tokyo, Japan. The organization was founded by former kickboxer Caesar Takeshi in 1985.\nShootboxing is a mixture of its two parent combat styles of shoot wrestling and kickboxing, allowing for kicks, punches, knees, elbows, throws, and standing submissions (chokeholds, armlocks and wristlocks).\nHistory.\nShoot boxing (commonly written as Shootboxing) was created in August 1985 by former kickboxer Caesar Takeshi.\n The first Shootboxing event took place on September 1, 1985.\nSome mixed martial artists such as Hayato Sakurai began their careers in Shootboxing. Shootboxing has also drawn fighters who became famous in other promotions such as Jens Pulver. Many K-1 World MAX stars also either debuted in Shootboxing or have fought for Shootboxing in the past, including Andy Souwer, Albert Kraus, and Buakaw Banchamek.\nRules.\nShootboxing rules are as follows:\nMatch form.\nProfessional shoot boxing matches fall into one of two classes, Expert class and Freshman class. The length of an Expert class match is five rounds of three minutes each, followed by one or two extra rounds of three minutes each in the event of a tie. The interval between rounds is one minute.\nThe length of a Freshman class match is three rounds of three minutes each, followed by one or two three-minute rounds in the event of a tie. The interval between rounds is also one minute.\nWeight classes.\nProfessional shoot boxers are divided into weight classes as follows:\nSparrowweight was divided into Flyweight and Super flyweight, and Eagleweight was divided into Heavyweight and Super heavyweight since 2001.\nMatch judgment.\nOne way to win a shoot boxing match is to knock one's opponent out. A fighter can be knocked out in different ways. If, after being knocked down, a fighter fails to stand up after a count of ten, or if, after standing up, he fails to assume a fighting stance after a count of eight, he is knocked out. The same occurs if a fighter is knocked out of the ring and fails to return before a count of twenty. A referee may also rule a fighter knocked out if the fighter shows no fighting spirit, appears unable to defend his or her self, or makes a gesture of submission.\nTechnical knockouts can also occur in shoot boxing, in cases where the fighter is injured, the referee rules the fighter knocked out after two knockdowns in the same round, or the fighter's corner throws in the towel. A fight may also be stopped if a doctor rules that continuation would be dangerous to a fighter.\nIf neither a knockout nor a technical knockout occurs, the winner is determined by a decision. Fighters are graded on their effectiveness on attack and defense, their success in achieving and escaping submissions, and how close they have come to ending the match. Decisions generally produce a winner, but can result in a draw.\nA judgement of \"no contest\" may also be returned, if the judges suspect foul play or conclude that the fighters are not fighting sincerely.\nMatch scoring.\nFighters are awarded points for their success in striking, throwing, and applying standing submission holds to their opponent. They are also given points for four categories of performance: number of times down, amount of damage done to opponent, number of clean hits, and aggressiveness. Fighters are graded from 1–10 in each category, with the difference of score in any one category being limited to 4 points.\nExtra points can be awarded at certain points in the match, when the referee makes certain calls. When a fighter performs a front or back throwing technique, the referee calls \"shoot\", denoting one of these opportunities. The other occurs when a fighter achieves a standing submission; at this point, the referee calls \"catch\".\nFouls.\nFoul play is recognized as the following ① to ⑬. After a warning, the fighter will receive a point deduction for further infractions. If the same fighter commits another foul, another point is deducted, and a final warning is given. If a third warning is given to the same fighter, he is disqualified and loses the fight.\nIf the referee feels that it was not a flagrant foul, he may allow the fight to continue.\nWhen either fighter receives a cut from a headbutt, the fighter that made the cut receives a point deduction, even if the headbutt was accidental.\nIf the referee decides that the headbutt was intentional, the fighter receives a two-point deduction.\n\"An attempt to escape attacks\" is defined as the act whose intent is to interrupt the opponent's offense or defense by grappling immediately after an attack.\nA fighter will be disqualified in the case of any of the following situations:\nChampionship history.\nS-Cup World Champions.\nMale S-Cup World Champions.\nS-Cup, the Shoot Boxing World Cup, is the 8 man single elimination World Tournament generally held once every 2 years since 1995. \nGirls S-Cup World Champions.\nGirls S-Cup, is the 8 woman single elimination World Tournament generally held once every year since 2009.\nShoot Boxing Japan champions.\nMen Shoot Boxing Japan champions.\nHeavyweight championship (formerly Super Eagleweight).\n\"Weight limit: 90kg\"\nLight Heavyweight championship (formerly Eagleweight).\n\"Weight limit: 80kg\"\nSuper Middleweight championship (formerly Hawkweight).\n\"Weight limit: 75kg\"\nMiddleweight championship (formerly Junior Hawkweight).\n\"Weight limit: 72.5kg\"\nSuper Welterweight championship (formerly Falconweight).\n\"Weight limit: 70kg\"\nWelterweight championship (formerly Junior Falconweight).\n\"Weight limit: 67.5kg\"\nSuper Lightweight championship (formerly Seagullweight).\n\"Weight limit: 65kg\"\nLightweight championship (formerly Junior Seagullweight).\n\"Weight limit: 62.5kg\"\nSuper Featherweight championship (formerly Cardinalweight).\n\"Weight limit: 60kg\"\nFeatherweight championship (formerly Junior Cardinalweight).\n\"Weight limit: 57.5kg\"\nSuper Bantamweight championship (formerly Owlweight).\n\"Weight limit: 55kg\"\nBantamweight championship (formerly Junior Owlweight).\n\"Weight limit: 52.5kg\"\nWomen Shoot Boxing Japan champions.\nGirls Japan S-cup.\nWomen's Lightweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 65kg\"\nWomen's Flyweight championship (formerly Ladybugweight).\n\"Weight limit: 52kg\"\nWomen's Strawweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 49kg\"\nWomen's Atomweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 46kg\"\nShoot Boxing International Men champions.\nWorld Heavyweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 90kg\"\nWorld Middleweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 75kg\"\nWorld Super Welterweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 70kg\"\nAustralia Super Welterweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 70kg\"\nBrazil Super Welterweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 70kg\"\nAmerica Super Welterweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 70kg\"\nWorld Welterweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 67.5kg\"\nOriental and Pacific Super Welterweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 67.5kg\"\nWorld Super Lightweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 65kg\"\nAmerica Super Featherweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 60kg\"\nShoot Boxing International Women champions.\nWorld Women's Flyweight championship.\n\"Weight limit: 52kg\""

        "text": "The Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) is a large insect native to western North America in rangelands dominated by sagebrush and forbs. \"Anabrus\" is a genus in the shield-backed katydid subfamily in the Tettigoniidae family, commonly called katydids, bush crickets, and previously \"long-horned grasshoppers\". Its common name, \"Mormon cricket\", is a misnomer: true crickets are of the family Gryllidae.\nThe Mormon cricket takes its common name from the prominent role it played in the miracle of the gulls, after the Mormon settlers in Utah had encountered them while pushing westward.\nAlthough flightless, the Mormon cricket may travel up to two kilometres a day in its swarming phase, during which it may be a serious agricultural pest and sometimes a traffic hazard.\nDescription.\nMormon crickets can grow to almost in length. Individuals vary in coloration: the overall color may be black, brown, red, purple or green. The pronotum, the dorsal \"shield\" above the prothorax, covers vestigial wings); in some specimens it bears colored markings. The abdomen may have a striped appearance. Like many Tettigoniidae, females have a long ovipositor, which should not be mistaken for a stinger. \nAs is characteristic of Tettigoniidae, the antennae are long and filamentous. They are in general longer than the head plus body, though the ovipositor extends to beyond the ends of the antennae. \nAs also is the case in swarming locusts, high population densities of swarming Mormon crickets cause them to undergo changes in morphology and coloration: solitaria, individuals in the solitary phase, typically have green or purple coloration, while swarming individuals, gregaria, are often black, brown or red.\nLife cycle.\nMormon cricket eggs hatch mostly in the spring after they are laid, although in some areas eggs may take as many as five years to hatch. Hatching begins when soil temperatures reach . The nymphs pass through seven instars before reaching the adult stage, typically taking 60 to 90 days.\nBreeding begins within 10 to 14 days of reaching the adult stage. The male passes to the female a large spermatophore which can be up to 27% of his body weight. The spermatophore is mostly food for the female to consume but also contains sperm to fertilize her eggs. This nuptial gift causes swarming-phase females to compete for males, a behavior not seen in solitary-phase females.\nThe female lays her eggs by thrusting her long ovipositor deep into the soil. Each female can lay over one hundred eggs, with individual eggs having the appearance of a grain of rice with a gray to purplish color.\nSwarming.\nThe Mormon cricket exists in populations of relatively low density throughout most of its range. At certain times and places, population explosions or infestations occur in which large numbers of the crickets form roving bands. These bands may include millions of individuals and be found with densities of up to 100 individuals per square meter. These infestations may last years or even decades, and are characterized by a gradual increase and then decrease in population. The factors that trigger these infestations are poorly understood, but are thought to be weather-related.\nResearch published in 2006 shows that Mormon crickets move in these migratory bands, firstly to find new sources of the critical nutrients of protein and salt, and secondly to avoid being eaten by hungry crickets approaching from the rear. The Mormon cricket's cannibalistic behavior may lead to swarm behavior because crickets may need to move constantly forward to avoid attacks from behind.\nWhen a large band crosses a road, it can create a safety hazard by causing distracted revulsion on the part of the driver, and by causing the road surface to become slick with crushed crickets. The crickets can cause devastation to agriculture.\nDiet.\nThe Mormon cricket shows a marked preference for forbs, but grasses and shrubs such as sagebrush are also consumed. Mormon crickets also eat insects, including other Mormon crickets, especially individuals that have been killed or injured by automobiles or insecticides. Cannibalistic behavior may be a result of protein and salt deficiency. Swarming behavior may in turn be a strategy to avoid predation by other Mormon crickets. A journal documenting an 1846 journey along the Oregon Trail describes an encounter with the crickets and notes their cannibalistic behavior:\nThe ground, for a strip of about four miles, was covered with black crickets of a large size. I saw some that were about three inches in length, and measuring about three-fourths of an inch in diameter; but the common size were two inches in length and one-half or five-eighths of an inch in diameter; their legs were large in proportion to the size of their bodies. Some were singing on stalks of wild sage; others crawling in every direction. Our teams made great havoc among them; so numerous were they that we crushed them at every step. As soon as one was killed, others of them would alight upon it and devour it.\nControl.\nMormon crickets are preyed upon by a wide variety of birds and mammals. These predators include California gulls, crows, coyotes and various rodents. There are no predators that specialize on Mormon crickets, which may be explained by the cricket's migratory habits and large population fluctuations. \"Gordius robustus\", a species of horsehair worm, is a parasite of the Mormon cricket, as is \"Ooencyrtus anabrivorus\".\nThe most common chemical control method used is carbaryl (typically sold as \"Sevin Dust\") bait. This bait kills both the Mormon crickets that eat the bait, and the crickets that eat crickets that have eaten the bait. Insecticides applied directly to crops may kill the insects, but due to the large size of swarms, this method usually does not save the crop from being destroyed.\nAs Mormon crickets are flightless, physical barriers may be effective. Barriers should be at least two feet high and made of a smooth material. Residents of some small towns have used boom boxes and sound systems playing hard rock music in attempts to divert the moving swarms away from crops and houses.\nAnother method for the control of Mormon crickets is the use of a biopesticide based on the fungus \"Nosema locustae\". \"N. locustae\" is a naturally occurring microbe the spores of which kill orthopterans by interfering with the digestive system. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, its use has no adverse effect on humans or the environment.\nHistorical.\nMormon crickets appear in some traditional Native American diets such as that of the Achomawi.\nAn infestation of Mormon crickets in the Salt Lake Valley the late 1840s decimated the crops of Latter-day Saint colonists in the area, which is why they are referred to as Mormon crickets. This is most famously recalled in the \"Miracle of the gulls\" story.\nIn 2003, officials in Utah, Idaho and Nevada said that year's infestation might be the worst in recent history."

        "title": "College baseball",
        "text": "College baseball is baseball that is played on the intercollegiate level at institutions of higher education. In the United States, college baseball is sanctioned mainly by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA); in Japan, it is governed by the (JUBF).\nIn comparison to American football and basketball, college competition in the United States plays a smaller role in developing professional players, as baseball's professional minor leagues are more extensive, with a greater history of supplying players to Major League Baseball (MLB). Moving directly from high school to the professional level is more common in baseball than in football or basketball. However, if players opt to enroll at a four-year college, they must complete three years of college to regain professional eligibility, or have turned at least age 21 before starting their third year of college. Players who enroll at junior colleges (i.e., two-year institutions) regain eligibility after one year at that level. During the ongoing NCAA regular season, 301 teams have competed at the Division I level in the United States, with top teams progressing through the regular season, various conference tournaments and championship series, and the 2023 NCAA Division I baseball tournament to play for the Division I championship in the 2023 Men's College World Series.\nOrganization.\nAs with most other U.S. intercollegiate sports, competitive college baseball is played under the auspices of either the NCAA, the NAIA, the NJCAA, the CCCAA, or the NWAC. The NCAA writes the rules of play, while each sanctioning body supervises season-ending tournaments. The final rounds of the NCAA Division I tournament is known as the Men's College World Series (MCWS); while each of the three levels of competition sanctioned by the NCAA holds a championship tournament, the \"Men's College World Series\" branding is reserved strictly for the final round of the Division I tournament. The MCWS takes place in Omaha, Nebraska in June, following the regular season. The playoff bracket for Division I consists of 64 teams, with four teams playing at each of 16 regional sites (in a double-elimination format). The 16 winners advance to the Super Regionals at eight sites, played head-to-head in a best-of-three series. The eight winners then advance to the MCWS, a double-elimination tournament (actually two separate four-team brackets) to determine the two national finalists. The finalists play a best-of-three series to determine the Division I national champion. The most recent Men's College World Series winner is LSU.\nHistory.\nThe first intercollegiate baseball game took place in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on July 1, 1859, between squads representing Amherst College and Williams College. Amherst won, 73–32. This game was one of the last played under an earlier version of the game known as \"Massachusetts rules\", which prevailed in New England until the \"Knickerbocker Rules\" (or \"New York Rules\") developed in the 1840s gradually became accepted. The first ever nine-man team college baseball game under the Knickerbocker Rules still in use today was played in New York on November 3, 1859, between the \"Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club\" of St. John's College (now Fordham University) against The College of St. Francis Xavier, now known as Xavier High School.\nStudents at many colleges began organizing games between colleges, particularly after the Civil War, first in the northeastern United States but quickly throughout the country. By the late 1870s, several northeastern schools were playing regular home and home series. The team with the best record claimed a \"National Championship.\" Arguments over professional and graduate players led to the creation of the American College Base Ball Association in late 1879, consisting of six northeastern schools which sought to govern such issues and organize games. This organization lasted until 1887, when it dissolved in acrimony and waves of realignment. The Western Conference and Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association were formed in the 1890s as multi-sport conferences. The first tournament to name a national champion was held at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, resulting in Yale being crowned champion. No other such tournament was held until the first College World Series in 1947.\nTraditionally, college baseball has been played in the early part of the year, with a relatively short schedule and during a time when cold (and/or rainy) weather hinders the ability for games to be played, particularly in the northern and midwestern parts of the U.S. These and other factors have historically led colleges and universities across the nation to effectively consider baseball a minor sport, both in scholarships as well as money and other points of emphasis.\nCollege baseball's popularity has increased greatly since the 1980s. As increased efforts to popularize the sport resulted in better players and overall programs, more television and print media coverage began to emerge. The ESPN family of networks have greatly increased television coverage of the NCAA playoffs and the College World Series since 2003.\nFor 2008 and succeeding seasons, the NCAA mandated the first ever start date for Division I baseball, thirteen weeks before the selection of the NCAA tournament field, which takes place on Memorial Day.\nCollegiate rules.\nThe rules of college baseball are similar to the Official Baseball Rules. Exceptions include the following:\nMetal versus wood bat.\nThough a wood bat is legal in NCAA competition, players overwhelmingly prefer and use a metal bat. The metal bat was implemented in college baseball in 1975. Use of a metal bat is somewhat controversial. Supporters of an aluminum or composite bat note that it can increase offensive performance, as the speed of a ball off a metal bat is generally faster than off a wood bat. Those against metal, and for wood, argue that a metal bat is not safe to use, and that a metal bat does not prepare players for the next level, as professional baseball uses a wood bat exclusively. In the 2011 season the NCAA changed the requirements for a metal bat, reducing the maximum allowed exit speed in a way that is said to produce a feeling more like a wood bat. As a result, in 2011 there was a drop-off in overall \"long\" drives or home runs relative to past years.\nDraft process.\nAll players resident in the U.S. and its territories, plus Canada, are eligible to be selected in Major League Baseball's Rule 4 Draft upon graduating from high school. However, once a player enrolls in a four-year college or university, he is not allowed to be drafted (or re-drafted) until completing three years of school or reaching age 21, whichever comes first. By contrast, players who enroll in junior colleges (i.e., two-year institutions) are eligible for selection at any time. The Rule 4 Draft of eligible college and high school players consists of 20 rounds, most recently reduced from 40 after the 2019 edition. Despite MLB's draft being considerably longer than that of the NFL or NBA, only about 9.1% of all NCAA senior baseball players are drafted by an MLB team.\nOne of the biggest controversies with the draft and these amateur athletes is the use of agents. There have been many cases of college athletes consulting or hiring an agent prematurely in direct violation of NCAA rules. The NCAA came up with the \"no agent rule\" as a result of this, claiming it was to benefit the amateur athletes. The rule states that \"[a]n individual shall be ineligible for participation in an intercollegiate sport if he or she has agreed (orally or in writing) to be represented by an agent for the purpose of marketing his or her athletics ability or reputation in that sport\". Representation of an agent is considered to be any direct contact with the professional team during the contract negotiations. This contact can be made many different ways, whether through direct conversation, via mail or through the telephone. This rule is strongly enforced by the NCAA and has harsh consequences if broken. Recent changes to NCAA rules regarding compensation to college athletes for the use of their name, image, and likeness (NIL) have clarified that players can sign with agents to negotiate endorsement deals without loss of eligibility, though not for negotiating with professional teams.\nRecruitment process.\nThe recruitment process is similar to that of the Major League Draft in that a high school athlete is taking the next step in his career. The NCAA places restrictions on the coaches that are trying to convince athletes to come play for them and attend their university. College baseball programs are only allowed to offer a limited number of scholarships each year, so the process of earning a scholarship is quite competitive. Baseball is classified by the NCAA as an \"equivalency\" sport, meaning that limits on athletic financial aid are set to the equivalent of a fixed number of full scholarships. Division I schools are allowed the equivalent of 11.7 full scholarships; Division II schools, only 9.0. Schools generally choose to award multiple partial scholarships rather than exclusively full scholarships. In Division I, the NCAA also limits the total number of players receiving baseball-related financial aid to 27, and also requires that each of these players receive athletic aid equal to at least 25% of a full scholarship. The 25% rule does not apply to schools that offer aid based solely on financial need (most notably Ivy League members), and also does not apply to a player in his final year of athletic eligibility who has not previously received athletically related aid in baseball at any college. A long-standing official NCAA rules interpretation also allows schools to count aid that would otherwise be exempt by NCAA rule (such as purely academic awards) toward the 25% limit, as long as it also is included in the calculations for the team equivalency limit.\nBefore September 1 of a potential college player's 11th grade year, it is illegal for a college program to give any kind of recruiting materials to the prospect. A phone call is not even permitted to the prospect until July 1 of the student's 11th grade year. Once the player is committed to the school of his choice, he must sign his letter of intent during one of several signing periods. The early signing period for a Division I baseball player is between November 8 and 15; the late signing period dates for these players are April 11 to August 1.\nSubstance policies.\nThe substance policies for college baseball are very strict and set by the NCAA. There is a set list of substances a college baseball player is forbidden to put in his body, and there is severe punishment for those that defy it, whether it would be intentional or unintentional. There is a very long list of these substances, including alcohol, marijuana, anabolic steroids, and heroin, to name just a few. These substances fit into categories such as stimulants, anabolic steroids, diuretics, street drugs, hormones, anti-estrogens, and more. Failure to pass scheduled or random drug tests can result in ineligibility.\nVideo gaming.\nAfter losing its license for Major League Baseball, EA Sports released ', the first college baseball video game. A second game, ', was also released before the series was discontinued due to low sales."

        "title": "North Harbour Rugby Union",
        "text": "The North Harbour Rugby Union (NHRU), commonly known as North Harbour or simply Harbour, is the governing body of rugby union that encompasses a wide geographical area north of Auckland that includes North Shore City, Rodney District, the Hibiscus Coast and part of Waitakere City. There are 12 rugby clubs from Mahurangi RFC, based in Warkworth, Rodney District, in the north through to Massey the southernmost area of the union.\nThe NHRU provincial rugby team that was formed in 1985 by clubs that left the Auckland Rugby Union. It competes in the Mitre 10 Cup, the successor to New Zealand's former domestic competition, the National Provincial Championship (NPC).\nHistory.\nNorth Harbour was formed in 1985 by clubs that broke away from the Auckland Rugby Union. The Hibiscus flower was chosen as the new union's logo in reference to part of the union's catchment area - the Hibiscus Coast.\nThe first side chosen to represent the union was an under 20 side who played Felbridge, a touring side from Britain. Grant Ferguson had the honour of scoring the union's first points via a penalty, with his captain, Alan McCulloch scoring the union's first try.\nThe union expanded in 1989 when the Omaha, Warkworth and Kaipara Flats clubs merged to become the Mahurangi club and switched from the North Auckland union.\nNorth Harbour has enjoyed a great deal of success on the rugby field having produced All Blacks and other New Zealand Representative players, and also winning the 3rd division title in their first year, then promotion to NPC Division 1, and making the finals of the NPC competition on several occasions during the 1990s, including hosting the 1994 final at a capacity-crowd Onewa Domain against Auckland and qualifying for the Super 10 competition in 1993, 1994 and 1995.\nOnewa Domain, Northcote was the former home base for North Harbour rugby. North Harbour players play in the Super Rugby competition as part of the Auckland Blues partnership with the neighbouring Northland and Auckland unions. With the development of the North Harbour Stadium at Albany in the late 1990s, this stadium became the home base of Harbour rugby.\nNorth Harbour play in the Mitre 10 Cup. In 2006 North Harbour were the first team to play the new Tasman Makos winning 33–27 in Blenheim.\nThey would go on to win their next eight of ten games including an historical victory over Canterbury for the Ranfurly Shield.\nHowever they were beaten by Otago 21–56 in the quarter-finals. 2007 was a year of disappointment for North Harbour. Waikato claimed the Ranfurly Shield with a crushing 52–7 over the holders North Harbour. The team would only win four of ten matches including two draws to miss the playoffs. North Harbour won only three matches in 2008 finishing 12th. 2009 was the same with North Harbour finishing 12th, however they defeated the champions Canterbury 22–19 in the opening round and beat Auckland 16–14 at Eden Park. In 2010 North Harbour beat Japan 23–19 to start their 25th Jubilee Celebrations. However the team managed only four wins to finish 11th. In 2011 the team finished 6th in the Championship, but nearly beat Southland 23–25 in a Ranfurly Challenge. 2012 and 2013 were disappointing years for North Harbour finishing last in the Championship with only one win to their seasons.\n2014 was downfall for North Harbour, as they only won 3 games, against Manawatu (24-13), Canterbury (29-24) and Hawkes Bay (28-25)\n2015 seemed the same for North Harbour, they won 3 games again, against Southland (26-25), Counties Manukau (28-20) and Northland (36-12)\n2016 saw North Harbour get promoted up from the Championship division, beating Counties Manukau (20-17), Manawatu (29-25), Southland (35-14), Bay of Plenty (44-34), and Northland (44-28),They defeated Wellington in the semi-final (40-37) and defeating Otago to be promoted to the 2017 Premiership (17-14)\nIn 2017, North Harbour won a lot of their games, beating Otago (19-17), Southland (45-20), their greatest Battle of the Bridge win against Auckland (57-10), Counties Manukau (27-18), Northland (22-31), Hawke's Bay (33-30), Waikato (13-11), They made the semi-finals but did not beat Canterbury (35-24 loss)\n2018 saw North Harbour beat Northland (21-20), Waikato (28-29), Bay of Plenty (32-30), Hawke's Bay (34-51), Taranaki (26-55), Counties Manukau (36-26).\nRanfurly Shield.\nNorth Harbour's first ten challenges for the Ranfurly Shield were unsuccessful, notably in 1996 when they challenged for it three times in 6 weeks against Taranaki, Waikato and Auckland. North Harbour succeeded in their eleventh challenge for the shield on 24 September 2006 by beating the previous holders Canterbury 21–17 at Jade Stadium in Christchurch.\nUnder the rules of the Shield challenge, they had to defend the Shield before the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup season against teams in New Zealand's second tier domestic competition, the semi-professional Heartland Championship. Accordingly, they scheduled defences against Thames Valley on 30 June 2007 and Horowhenua-Kapiti on 14 July. Harbour easily won their first defence 69–0 over Thames Valley, and followed it up two weeks later with a 99–6 victory over Horowhenua-Kapiti.\nAfter defeating Taranaki 19–13 in their first challenge in the Air New Zealand Cup, North Harbour lost the Ranfurly Shield to Waikato by a record margin of 52–7.\nNorth Harbour in Super Rugby.\nNorth Harbour is one of three provinces included in the Blues franchise who play in the Super Rugby competition; their players are eligible to be picked by the Blues without relying on \"player drafting\".\nAt the beginning of Super Rugby, North Harbour was part of the Chiefs franchise as a combined team of Auckland and North Harbour was thought to be unfair by the NZRU; Auckland and North Harbour collectively had a large percentage of the All Blacks of the time. Later however, North Harbour along with Northland were 'swapped' for Counties Manukau and Thames Valley, thus joined the Blues.\nPrior to the professionalisation of rugby, North Harbour competed as a stand-alone union in the predecessor to Super Rugby, the Super 10 competition, in 1993, 1994 and 1995.\nClub and high-school rugby.\nThe North Harbour Club Rugby season runs annually from March through to the beginning of August. The premier title is fought for among senior teams for the right to be crowned North Harbour Club Rugby Champions. The winner receives the ASB Cup.\nThere are also 16 secondary schools fielding close to 100 teams within the North Harbour Region. Due to the ratio of secondary schools to rugby clubs, there is a strong relationship between the two.\nClub Champions.\n\"For list of North Harbour club rugby champions, see\" North Harbour Club Rugby Champions\nFormer players.\nThese are players who have played for North Harbour in the past and have gone on to play international rugby and accomplish other feats as listed:\nMascot.\nThe Harbour Master is the official Mascot for the North Harbour Rugby Union, He is dressed in a naval captain's style suit with a large smiling head and carries with him at all times an oversized pair of binoculars.\n\"2010 ITM Cup Appearances\"\n\"2010 Television Appearances\"\n\"Facts\"\nKit and sponsors.\nApparel is supplied by Paladin Sports.

He went 2–7 with a 6.05 ERA in in 6 starts with the Cubs. He started the year in the Cubs bullpen but was sent down to the Iowa Cubs on June 3. On Opening Day in 2003, Cruz struck out 6 consecutive batters, becoming only the second Cubs reliever to do so.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn March 25, , Cruz, along with Steve Smyth, were acquired by the Atlanta Braves, from the Chicago Cubs, for Andy Pratt and Richard Lewis. In 2004, with the Braves, Cruz went 6–2 with a 2.75 ERA in 50 relief appearances while setting a career high in wins and games pitched, and placed second in the Atlanta bullpen with 8.75 K's per 9 innings. Also, with runners in scoring position, opposing batters only hit .159 against him.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn December 16, 2004, the Oakland Athletics acquired Cruz, along with Dan Meyer and Charles Thomas, from the Atlanta Braves, in exchange for Tim Hudson. In 2005, Cruz struggled in the beginning of the year and was sent down to Triple-A Sacramento in June. Cruz returned to the big-league team in September 2005 when rosters expanded, and he recorded a 4.82 ERA in his last 7 games of the season. His overall stats for the year were an 0–3 record and a 7.44 ERA with 34 strikeouts in 28 games in Oakland. After going 2–0 with 10.1 scoreless innings for Oakland in 2006 Spring Training, Cruz was dealt to the Arizona Diamondbacks for pitcher Brad Halsey.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nIn March 2006, the Oakland Athletics traded Cruz to the Arizona Diamondbacks for pitcher Brad Halsey. Cruz pitched in four scoreless outings for the D'backs in the spring after being traded. Cruz began the year in the starting rotation, and went 3–3 with a 4.05 ERA and 41 K's in 14 games, before being placed on the day-to-day disabled list with shoulder soreness on June 6. Two days later, he was moved to the 15-day DL. Cruz bounced between the bullpen and the rotation in 2006, but was used strictly out of the bullpen in 2007. He was on the disabled list for about three weeks from late-April to early-May 2007.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn February 28, 2009, the Kansas City Royals signed Cruz to a two-year, $5.5 million contract with a club option for the 2011 season. On April 23, 2010, the Royals released Cruz.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn February 3, 2011, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Cruz to a minor league contract.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nCruz signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates on February 1, 2012. He also received an invitation to spring training.\nCruz was called up prior to the season. On August 20, 2012, Cruz was designated for assignment. On August 23, 2012, Cruz refused his assignment to Triple-A and was released.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn January 16, 2013, Cruz signed with the Philadelphia Phillies. But on February 13, 2013, before the first Spring Training workout began, the Phillies released Cruz after they mutually agreed to rescind their agreement.\nPitching style.\nCruz throws five pitches. His primary three pitches are a four-seam fastball (90–95), cut fastball (87–90), and slider (78–80).

        "title": "2005 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2005 proceeded in keeping with rules enacted in 2001. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) held an election to select from recent players, voting Ryne Sandberg and Wade Boggs into the Hall. The Veterans Committee held a separate election to select from players retired more than 20 years, but did not elect anyone.\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown were held July 31 with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1985 or later, but not after 1999; the ballot included candidates from the 2004 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1999. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2005 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 4. The ballot consisted of 27 players; 516 ballots were cast, with 387 votes required for election. A total of 3263 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.32 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (26 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nThe newly-eligible candidates included 10 All Stars (two of whom were not on the ballot), who were selected for a combined total of 43 times. Wade Boggs, a 12-time All Star, and Darryl Strawberry, an eight-time All Star, were the only new candidates selected five or more times. The ballot included one Rookie of the Year (Strawberry), one Cy Young Award-winner (Jack McDowell), and one MVP (Willie McGee).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Paul Assenmacher, Jeff Blauser, Mike Blowers, John Cangelosi, Jim Corsi, Rich DeLucia, Tony Fossas, Carlos García, Jack Howell, Darrin Jackson, Jeff King, Mike Macfarlane, Kirt Manwaring, Derrick May, Brian McRae, Eric Plunk, Mark Portugal, Mel Rojas, Paul Sorrento, and Dale Sveum.\nOf the new players on the ballot, only Wade Boggs was elected; Willie McGee was the only other first-timer to receive enough votes to remain on the ballot, receiving the exact minimum (26) to stay eligible.\nVeterans Committee.\nRules enacted in August 2001 provided that the Veterans Committee would be expanded from its previous 15 members, elected to limited terms, to include the full living membership of the Hall. Elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives) held every fourth year. No candidates were elected from either ballot in 2003. Following 2004, when no Veterans election was held, the Committee voted in 2005 on players who were active no later than 1983; the next such election was in 2007. There was no 2005 election for non-players; the last such election was in 2003, and the next was held in 2007.\nPreliminary phase.\nIn December 2003, a Historical Overview Committee of nine sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met at the Hall of Fame's library and nominated 200 players who were active in the major leagues no later than 1983. They were provided with statistical information by the Elias Sports Bureau, official statistician for Major League Baseball since the 1920s, which also identified the 1,400 players with 10 or more years of play who were eligible.\nThe Historical Overview Committee comprised Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"), Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau), Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"), Moss Klein (Newark \"Star-Ledger\"), Bill Madden (\"New York Daily News\"), Ken Nigro (former \"Baltimore Sun\" writer), Jack O'Connell (\"The Hartford Courant\"), Tracy Ringolsby (\"Rocky Mountain News\"), and Mark Whicker (\"Orange Country Register\"). Their list of 200 players was announced April 19, 2004.\nPlayers. († marks those newly eligible since 2003 (eight). They last played in the majors during 1982 or 1983.)\nBabe Adams - Joe Adcock - Dick Allen - Felipe Alou - Sal Bando - Dick Bartell - Ginger Beaumont - †Mark Belanger - Wally Berger - Bobby Bonds - Ken Boyer - Harry Brecheen - Tommy Bridges - Pete Browning - Charlie Buffinton - Lew Burdette - George H.

Williams - Maury Wills - Smoky Joe Wood - Wilbur Wood - Glenn Wright - Jimmy Wynn - Rudy York\nThe 200 players were almost evenly divided between players retired less than 50 years (99 players retired from 1955 to 1983) and those retired over 50 years (101 players retired 1954 or earlier).\nThe list of 200 was almost identical to the list prepared for the 2003 election; apart from the eight players who were newly eligible, only Larry Doyle, Andy Pafko and Smoky Joe Wood were added to the list, for a net change of 11 individuals. Perhaps due to the reliance on \"official\" statistics – often incomplete in the sport's early years – provided by the Elias Sports Bureau, the committee included very few players from the sport's first half-century, which remained poorly represented in the Hall; only 15 players were included who made their debut before 1893. Although the Hall's current membership included fewer than a dozen non-pitchers of the 1870s and 1880s, compared to nearly 50 from the 1930s and 1940s, the committee included nearly 50 more players from the period between 1920 and 1945, but only 7 who played primarily in the 25 years before 1893: first baseman/outfielder Harry Stovey, shortstop Jack Glasscock, outfielder Pete Browning, and pitchers Charlie Buffinton, Bob Caruthers, Tony Mullane and Will White. The inclusion of Will White was remarkable in that his brother Deacon White is widely accepted as having been a far greater player. In addition to Deacon White, stars of the 19th century who were omitted included Paul Hines, Deacon McGuire, Cupid Childs, Bobby Lowe, George Gore, Hardy Richardson, Ezra Sutton, Arlie Latham, Fred Pfeffer and Joe Start.\nBy primary fielding position the nominees were starting pitchers (66), relief pitchers (9), catchers (10), first basemen (24), second basemen (8), third basemen (13), shortstops (19), left fielders (18), center fielders (17) and right fielders (16).\nPhase two.\nThe Historical Overview nominations were forwarded to a 60-member BBWAA screening committee comprising two writers from each major league city. In summer 2004 they elected 25 players who would appear on the final ballot. (Everyone voted for 25 nominees.) Meanwhile, a committee of six Hall of Fame members independently selected five of the 200 nominees who would appear on the final ballot, which would thereby comprise 25 to 30 players.\nEvidently the writers named all of the Hall of Fame members' five selections, for there were 25 on the final ballot.\nFinal ballot.\nOn December 6, 2004, the final ballot of 25 candidates was announced. Those selected played primarily from the 1950s onward, with only 5 of the 25 candidates having retired before 1960, and only three pitchers – Smoky Joe Wood, Carl Mays and Wes Ferrell – having retired before 1950. The BBWAA screening committee had failed to include any candidates from the era before 1910. This likely reflected a tendency among the voting writers to vote only for those players they had seen themselves, and to withhold votes from earlier players.\nAll 60 living members of the Hall were eligible to cast ballots in the final election, along with the 8 living recipients of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, the 14 living recipients of the Ford C. Frick Award, and the sole additional member of the pre-2001 Veterans Committee whose term had not yet expired (John McHale). Balloting was conducted by mail in January 2005, with voters permitted to vote for up to 10 candidates from the ballot of 25 individuals; \"all\" candidates who received at least 75% of the vote would be elected. Results of the voting by the Veterans Committee were announced on March 2.\nThere were 83 eligible voters, 80 of whom cast ballots; 60 votes were required for election. In all, 458 individual votes were cast, for an average of 5.73 votes per ballot. For the second consecutive Veterans Committee election, no player was elected. Of the 21 candidates who were also on the 2003 ballot, only 7 gained more votes in 2005, with only Joe Torre (7), Ron Santo (6) and Ken Boyer (4) increasing their totals by more than two votes. Candidates who were considered by the Committee for the first time are indicated here with a †; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The complete ballot, with the number of votes cast for each candidate, was:\nReaction.\nHall of Fame chairwoman Jane Forbes Clark responded to the Committee's failure to elect anyone by saying: \"The results of the last two elections show that the writers – by and large – have done a great job of electing players to the Hall of Fame. The current process works by upholding the Hall of Fame's high standards for election and by providing a more open, more inclusive and more understandable process.\" Noting that the top candidates gained slightly from the 2003 voting, she added: \"What's encouraging for me is that this shows the process to be dynamic, not static.\"\nHall of Fame member Tom Seaver, noting that he had voted for three candidates including Gil Hodges, said of the chances of future selections: \"I'm of the opinion it's going to be awfully hard, and maybe that's how it should be.\" He added: \"Will somebody make it out of this committee one day? Absolutely. I'm convinced they will.\"\nBut response from observers in the press and throughout baseball was widely critical. Stephen Cannella of \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote: \"Seaver's right. Hall of Fame standards should be high. But letting the inmates play gatekeeper allows them to make those standards unreachable. ... it might be too much to ask Hall of Famers to be guardians of their realm. ... Would you want to belong to a club that would have anyone else as a member?\"\nMike Downey of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote: \"And once again these gentlemen made it crystal clear they like their society being extremely exclusive. They act as aristocratically as a board from a private school or a homeowners association in the Hamptons. ... if the vote were left strictly to former players, they might not let another soul in.\"\nDave Anderson wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"It's time not only for the Cooperstown pooh-bahs to rethink this realigned committee's selection process, but also to question the responsibility of the do-nothing committee ... after two veterans committee shutouts, it's fair to wonder how responsibly do the Hall of Famers, especially the 58 ex-players among them, take their duty as voters? Do they really study the two pages of statistics, rankings and highlights supplied to them for each of the 25 candidates on the ballot – particularly those of players from other eras whom they never competed against and probably know nothing about? Do they just glance at the list and make a snap judgment?\"\nSome writers specifically lamented the failure to elect particular candidates. Ken Rosenthal wrote for \"The Sporting News\": \"The writers blew it, and now the Veterans Committee is blowing it. Former Cubs third baseman Ron Santo should be in the Hall of Fame. Santo's career .826 OPS is more than 100 points higher than Brooks Robinson's and is only 30 points lower than George Brett's. Nine All-Star Games, five Gold Gloves – what exactly is the problem?\" And Bill Madden of the \"New York Daily News\" wrote: \"Another exercise in futility by the new and expanded Veterans Committee has again left Gil Hodges waiting on the Hall of Fame doorstep.\"\nCandidate Tony Oliva responded to the election by saying: \"It's almost impossible to go into the Hall of Fame the way the system is now. It's ridiculous.\" And Ron Santo said: \"It was a very tough day. ... I'm fortunate to have a wonderful family that puts everything into perspective. ... It was hard to believe no one got in. One thing I can say is the next time I won't be sitting at home waiting for the phone.\"\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nPeter Gammons received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2004 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 2004, and conferred in the summer 2005 ceremonies.)\nThe Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". \nThe recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect. Living recipients were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nThree final candidates, selected by a BBWAA committee, were named on July 13, 2004 in Houston in conjunction with All-Star Game activities; the finalists were: Peter Gammons of \"The Boston Globe\", \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"ESPN The Magazine\"; the late Vern Plagenhoef, who covered the Detroit Tigers for Michigan's Booth Newspaper Group; and Tracy Ringolsby, who has covered the Colorado Rockies for the \"Rocky Mountain News\" since 1993 and has completed 30 seasons as a baseball writer. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\nOn December 12, Peter Gammons was announced as the recipient, having received 248 votes out of the 448 ballots cast, with Ringolsby receiving 134 votes and Plagenhoef receiving 66.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nJerry Coleman received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster.\nThe Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect. Living honorees were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nTo be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two; more than 160 candidates were eligible.\nOn December 13, 2004, 10 finalists were announced. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a research committee at the museum: Jerry Coleman, Ken Coleman, Dizzy Dean, Gene Elston, Tony Kubek, France Laux and Graham McNamee. Three additional candidates – Dave Niehaus, Tom Cheek and Ron Santo – were selected in voting by over 65,000 fans prior to November 2004 at the Hall's official website .\nOn February 22, Jerry Coleman was announced as the 2005 recipient ; a former major league infielder and the voice of the San Diego Padres almost continuously since 1972, he was selected in a January vote by a 20-member committee composed of the 14 living recipients, along with six additional broadcasting historians or columnists: Bob Costas (NBC), Barry Horn (\"The Dallas Morning News\"), Stan Isaacs (formerly of New York \"Newsday\"), Ted Patterson (historian), Curt Smith (historian) and Larry Stewart (\"Los Angeles Times\"). Committee members are asked to base the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans."

        "text": "The New York Knights are a semi-professional rugby league football team based in New York City. The team currently plays in the USA Rugby League. They play their home games at Pier 40 in Hudson River Park.\nOriginally known as the New York Broncos, the team was founded in 1997 and joined the league eventually known as the American National Rugby League (AMNRL) for its inaugural 1998 season. They adopted their current name in 2001 after forming a team partnership with the Newcastle Knights of Australia's National Rugby League, who sent them jerseys. The Knights competed in the AMNRL until it folded in 2014, and joined the USARL the following year. In the AMNRL they won season championships in 2002, 2009, 2011, and 2012.\nHistory.\nThe team was founded in 1997. Originally known as the New York Broncos, they joined Super League America, the predecessor to the modern American National Rugby League, for its inaugural 1998 season. In 2001 the Knights and other teams in the competition departed to form the AMNRL. All teams formed a partnership with teams in Australia's National Rugby League. New York formed a partnership with the Newcastle Knights, who sent them Knights jerseys; the team subsequently changed their name to the New York Knights.\nThe Knights advanced to the AMNRL Grand Final in 2002. A serious thunderstorm interrupted the game, and the Knights, who were leading perennial champions the Glen Mills Bulls 18-12, were declared winners. This was the first time any team besides the Bulls had taken the Grand Final. The Knights made several other playoff appearances, and defeated the Jacksonville Axemen to win the 2009 AMNRL Grand Final. The Knights have provided a total of nine players to the United States national rugby league team to date, as well as one to Japan.\nThe Knights remained in the AMNRL until it folded in 2014. The following year they joined the USA Rugby League, along with other surviving AMNRL clubs.\nUniform and colors.\nSince 2001 the Knights have based their uniforms and team colors on those of the Newcastle Knights of the NRL, due to their team partnership. Following Newcastle their colors are white, red and blue, and the uniforms are predominantly blue. For the 2006 and 2007 seasons the club's major jersey sponsor was Guinness.\nStadium.\nThe Knights currently use the Pier 40, Hudson River Park Stadium in Hudson River Park as their home ground. The stadium is sometimes referred to as \"The Castle\" because of the architecture and surrounding river, give the park a Castle like appearance.\nCurrent season.\nThe Knights finished the 2016 conference season with a record of 7-1. They will play the winners of Boston 13s v Brooklyn Kings in the Playoffs"

        "text": " (also called Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium) is a rugby union stadium located in the Aoyama district of central Tokyo, Japan. It is the spiritual home of Japanese rugby union and the headquarters of the Japan Rugby Football Union. Named for Prince Chichibu, the late brother of Emperor Hirohito, the venue is used mostly for rugby sevens and rugby union matches.\nRedevelopment plans call for the stadium and the adjacent Meiji Jingu Stadium, used for baseball, to be demolished and replaced with new facilities.\nFacilities.\nThe stadium currently can accommodate 27,188 spectators, but only part of the stands are covered. A large electronic scoreboard was added to the grounds as a step toward modernization before the fifth Rugby World Cup in 2003.\nOn April 19, 2007, it was announced that the stadium was to be equipped with lights for night games by the end of July, to assist with the RWC 2015 bid. The first rugby game under lights was Japan v Asian Barbarians in August 2007, the send-off for Japan going to RWC 2007. Since then it has been used for the first Top League game of the 2007–8 season between Suntory Sungoliath and Toshiba Brave Lupus, also played under lights and won 10–3 by the former on October 26, 2008.\nHistory.\nOriginally completed in 1947, it was at first called Tokyo Rugby Stadium. In 1953 the name was changed to Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium. The stadium also served as a venue for football matches in the 1964 Summer Olympics.\nThe name Chichibunomiya commemorates the sporting prince, Prince Chichibu, who was not a rugby union player but was passionately fond of the sport and died in 1953. A statue of the prince in a rugby uniform was erected at the stadium.\nOn February 3, 2008, snow prevented two Top League games being played in the 13th and final round of the fifth season. They were postponed to February 9.\nFrom 2012 through 2015, the stadium hosted the Japan Sevens, a newly created event on the circuit for men's national rugby sevens teams now known as the World Rugby Sevens Series. When inaugurated, the tournament was the seventh on the circuit schedule, and was held in late March/early April. After the 2014–15 series, Japan was removed from the schedule in favor of a return to former series host Singapore.\nFrom 2016, it has been used as the home ground for the Sunwolves Super Rugby team, along with Singapore National Stadium.\nIn 2018, the stadium was used for Nogizaka46 6th Year Birthday Live, they also use Meiji Jingu Stadium who placed beside this stadium simultaneously. All the members run back to back each stadium while performing. \nIn 2019, the Meiji Jingu Gaien, the Japan Sports Council, Mitsui Fudosan and Itochu Corp. groups agreed to redevelop both Meiji Jingu Stadium and the Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium. Under the plans, Meiji Jingu Stadium will be demolished and rebuilt on the site of the rugby ground. The replacement rugby stadium will be built on the current site of the Meiji Jingu Stadium Number 2 field. Officials have announced that the new stadium will have a roof over the field and stands."

The competition took place between February 20 and February 28, 1988.\nThe event included competitors from countries with little history of bobsleigh participation and/or little or no snow. These countries included Jamaica (whose involvement spurred the film \"Cool Runnings\" in 1993), Mexico, and New Zealand. An informal \"Caribbean Cup\" of such countries was won by New Zealand's Alexander Peterson and Peter Henry, who finished equal twentieth.

With nine debutants, more than a third of these were competing in Olympic bobsleigh for the first time. The nations making debuts were Netherlands Antilles, Australia, Bulgaria, U.S. Virgin Islands, Jamaica, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand and Portugal.\nIreland.\nFor the first time, a team from Ireland was also entered in the competition. However, just ten days before the opening ceremony took place, its entry was cancelled by the Olympic Council of Ireland, without explanation. An attempt to overturn the withdrawal in court was unsuccessful. The story is told in the 2020 documentary film \"Breaking Ice\"."

        "title": "Channel surfing",
        "text": "Channel surfing (also known as channel hopping or zapping) is the practice of quickly scanning through different television channels or radio frequencies to find something interesting to watch or listen to. Modern viewers, who may have cable or satellite services beaming down dozens if not hundreds or thousands of channels, are frequently channel surfing. It is common for people to scan channels when commercial broadcasters switch from a show over to running commercials.\nThe term is most commonly associated with television, where the practice became common with the wide availability of the remote control. The first published use of the term is November 1986, in an article by \"The Wall Street Journal\".\nViewers' propensity to channel surf was apparently a factor leading toward the current ATSC standard for terrestrial television, digital television in North America. An ATSC signal can be locked onto and start being decoded within about one second, while it can take several seconds to begin decoding a Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) signal.\nZappers.\nZappers are, according to media scholar Henry Jenkins, people who have a casual relationship with their televisions. Zappers do not remain on one channel for long, but continually skip from show to show, stopping for only a few minutes at a time on a particular channel.\nHistory.\nReferred to in Henry Jenkins' book, \"Convergence Culture\", published in 2006, describes individuals who \"constantly flit across the dial—watching snippets of shows rather than sitting down for a prolonged engagement\" (Jenkins 2006:75). More of a tendency than a defining characteristic, zappers can fluctuate from the habit, depending on what is on at any given time, personal feelings toward a show, amongst other variables. The concept was overstated in the 1990s when Phillip Swann \"wrote in TV.com: How Television is Shaping Our Future: ‘Few viewers today can sit through an entire program without picking up the remote and checking out another channel . . . Today’s viewer needs constant gratification: If she’s not entertained or intrigued for any stretch of time, she will flip the dial'\" (Jenkins 2006:75).\nMedia implications.\nAfter Initiative Media published its magazine \"The Initiative\" declaring that loyal fans are more valuable than zappers, television networks attempted to combat the zapper by increasing the personal appeal of their television shows, converting a zapper into a loyal fan (Jenkins 2006:75). This has led to a movement to slow down the zapper. Reality television has been suggested to be this bridge from zapper to loyal fan, being \"built up of 'attractions,' short, highly emotionally charged units that can be watched in or out of sequence\" (Jenkins 2006:77). \"American Idol\" is one such show, as it is \"designed to pull in every possible viewer and to give each a reason not to change the channel\" (Jenkins 2006:77). This technique has been perfected in \"American Idol\" via the cliffhanger commercial breaks and ending, convincing viewers to \"stay tuned following these messages\" or watch the show the next time it airs (Jenkins 2006:77).\nZapping TV shows.\nThe format or genre was pioneered with the Italian tv show \"Blob\", and was an instant great success. It was first broadcast on April 17, 1989, and shortly after adopted by CanalPlus in France with \"Le Zapping\". Canal Plus will then spread the format to other EU countries."

        "title": "Professional Darts Corporation",
        "text": "The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) is a professional darts organisation in the United Kingdom, established in 1992 when a group of leading players split from the British Darts Organisation (BDO) to form what was initially called the World Darts Council (WDC). Sports promoter Eddie Hearn is the PDC chairman.\nThe PDC developed and holds several championship competitions, including the annual PDC World Darts Championship, the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, UK Open, Premier League, and Grand Slam. It also runs its own world rankings based on players' performances.\nHistory.\nDarts had experienced a boom in the 1980s. A number of tournaments were televised on BBC and ITV, which allowed the top players to make a full time living from the sport and turn professional. However, darts steadily dropped from television schedules and by 1989 the only remaining televised event was the annual Embassy World Championship. Some of the players felt that not enough was being done by the governing body, the British Darts Organisation, to encourage new sponsors into the sport and arrange more television coverage. BDO chairman Olly Croft stated \"I don't owe any dart players a living\" and refused to guarantee more televised tournaments or permit the players to organise their own.\nAs a result, 16 professional players, including every previous BDO world champion who was still active in the game, created their own darts organisation, the World Darts Council (WDC), in January 1992. The players were led by sports promoters Tommy Cox and Dick Allix, both of whom used their own money to fund the fledgling organisation.\nThey wanted to appoint a PR consultant to improve the image of the game. The 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last time there was one unified world championship. The WDC players wore their new insignia on their sleeves during the tournament but were told to remove them by the BDO. The WDC players decided that if they were not going to be recognised by the BDO they would no longer play in the Embassy tournament.\nThe BDO took the step of banning the rebel players from playing in county darts and even threatened to ban any player who participated in exhibition events with WDC players.\nTomlin order.\nThe WDC players took the matter to court in a dispute which accrued large and perhaps unaffordable costs during a protracted legal process. The two bodies reached an out-of-court settlement on 30 June 1997 in the form of a Tomlin order.\nThe BDO recognised the WDC and agreed that all players shall have the freedom of choice as to which open events they wish to play in. The WDC dropped its claim to be a world governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation. The PDC accepted and recognized the World Darts Federation (WDF) as the governing body for the sport of darts worldwide, and the BDO the governing body for darts in the UK. The stated purpose of the agreement was to promote the freedom of individual darts players to participate freely in open competition.\nAnother condition of this Tomlin order is that the top 16 players, and any Home Country players ranked between 17 and 32 in each year's BDO Championship, and the top 16 players in each year's PDC Championship, shall not be permitted to enter the other competition in the immediate following year.\nDespite this condition, Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC within weeks of reaching the 2006 BDO final, later playing in (and winning) the 2007 PDC World Championship – the Tomlin order should have made him ineligible to play.\nThere was further controversy following the 2007 BDO World Championship, when Jelle Klaasen announced that he would be switching to the PDC. As a BDO World Champion, he signed a three-year deal in 2006 to return to the Lakeside event. The BDO threatened to take legal action for breach of contract, but with previous damage and costs incurred by other legal cases it has become less likely that any action will be taken in future with regards to player contracts and the Tomlin Order. 2007 semi-finalist Mervyn King also moved to the PDC, seemingly against the contracted condition that semi-finalists and finalists were bound to appear the next year.\nIn January 2012, the PDC invited the four semi-finalists of the BDO world championships, after obtaining a written agreement to release any player without penalty. Ted Hankey was the first player to move, as well as several players (who were not guaranteed a pro tour card due to not reaching the BDO semi finals) entering the PDC qualifying school, including Dean Winstanley, Tony West, Steve West, and Stuart Kellett.\nTelevision coverage.\nFollowing the breakaway groups first televised event in 1992 (the Lada UK Masters on Anglia Television), satellite broadcaster Sky Sports signed a deal to exclusively cover three PDC tournaments each year. To capitalise on its investment, the channel introduced a number of new techniques to make the coverage more interesting for armchair fans.\nUnlike the BDO world championship, which was covered via the general entertainment BBC Two channel, Sky's dedicated sports channel allowed the PDC matches to be covered in their entirety. Over ten hours per day of live darts on Sky Sports is not uncommon. The British Darts Organisation's events were more limited to selected matches and highlights, although in recent years the BBC increased its interactive TV coverage allowing viewers to see many more events live.\nSky television is an advertisement and subscription based channel, and generally after each set a commercial break is taken. Planet Funk's 2000 single \"Chase the Sun\" is played in the auditorium and it has become a cult track amongst darts fans, who tend to dance along to the tune during the breaks.\nCurrently Sky Sports broadcasts six tournaments live each year in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. PDC events are also televised in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Africa and the United States (One World Sports).\nThe PDC signed a three-year deal with ITV in 2007 with the inaugural Grand Slam of Darts from 2007 and the inaugural Players Championship from 2009. The matches are shown live on ITV4 with highlights on ITV1. ITV being an advertisement channel like Sky Sports, commercial breaks are taken after 5 legs; the tournaments that ITV cover do not play in sets. The Fratellis 2006 single \"Chelsea Dagger\" is played during the breaks on ITV. In 2010, Bravo signed a contract to show the European Championships.\nIn 2007, Sky Sports decided to extend their coverage of the Premier League Darts to 2010 following the high number of viewers to previous tournaments.\nIn February 2016, it was announced the BBC would cover the PDC for the first time with a new tournament being formed using the top 8 players on the PDC Order of Merit after the World Matchplay, known as the Champions League of Darts. As a result, the BBC dropped coverage of the BDO World Darts Championship, which they covered from 1978 to 2016 (this was the original World Championship prior to the formation of the PDC). DJ Ötzi's \"Hey! Baby\" is played during the breaks on the BBC.\nCameras.\nSky Sports introduced more cameras to cover the sport, and many of these innovations have been copied by other broadcasters.\nUnique \"flight cams\" show the trajectory of the dart through the air in slow motion to sometimes surprising results. A tiny camera has also been inserted into the dartboard itself beside the number 16 – one of the most common doubles – that shows the darts being thrown towards the board. Sky Sports have also used a \"player cam\"; a tiny camera was fitted to Dennis Priestley's shirt to capture his view of the action while playing.\nElsewhere, floating video cameras capture the action of the watching crowds. Spectators become far more animated and vocal than their BDO counterparts, often acting similar to a football crowd, while holding up humorous placards – often featuring corny puns – regarding the players, and chanting or singing various songs related to the players or to the event in general. Some supporters even wear face paint or crazy costumes or they dress up as their favourite player via their trademark attire or customary nickname.\nThe players' wives have also been a focus for the cameras, as they cheered or screeched on their husbands. In January 2005, Sky One commissioned a programme entitled \"Darts Players' Wives\", primarily focusing on the wives and their relationships.\nIn December 2008, Sky started to broadcast darts in High Definition (with the exception of the final Las Vegas Desert Classic in 2009), and in July 2010 (at the World Matchplay), broadcast the Semi Finals and Final in 3D to around 1,000 licensed premises in the UK and Republic of Ireland.\nAnother frequent cam is a split-screen camera, with the players on the right, and the dartboard on the left. If the first two darts hit the triple 20, the camera will zoom in to the spot before the third dart is thrown.\nCommentators.\nJohn Gwynne covered 20 PDC World Championships and 20 PDC World Matchplays, from the inaugural 1994 WDC World Darts Championship until his retirement in 2013. Dave Lanning covered all events up until December 2010, when he retired. Contrary to popular belief, long-time BBC darts commentator Sid Waddell did not switch allegiances to Sky until after the 1994 BDO World Championship. He brought his own unique brand of commentary to the game, and was a cult figure amongst darts fans and sport fans alike. He continued to commentate until his death in 2012. \nThe current commentators on Sky include John McDonald (commentator), Rod Studd, Stuart Pyke and Adam Smith, retired player Wayne Mardle and former World Champions John Part and Mark Webster. Jeff Stelling was the original presenter of Sky Sports' darts coverage, before Dave Clark took over in 2002. Clark retired in 2020, since when Emma Paton has been the lead presenter. In addition, the 2005 Premier League was fronted by Gary Newbon. \nITV events were fronted by Matt Smith from 2007 to 2014 but are now hosted by Jacqui Oatley from 2015 who became the first regular female darts host in the UK. Commentary for ITV has been provided by John Rawling, Alan Warriner-Little &amp; Pyke since 2007 with Chris Mason joining the coverage in 2008. Former darts commentators for ITV include Jim Proudfoot, Peter Drury and Steve Beaton. Ned Boulting presents features and interviews and deputises if the presenter is unavailable.\nBBC Sport showed the inaugural PDC Champions League of Darts on BBC One and BBC Two, with 16 hours of coverage over two days presented by BBC Final Score presenter Jason Mohammad alongside PDC professionals Mark Webster, Paul Nicholson and Warriner-Little, commentary by long time BBC darts commentator Vassos Alexander and PDC online reporter and commentator Dan Dawson with reports by Caroline Barker.\nBravo employed James Richardson and Dave Gorman to front its coverage until the channel closed in 2011.\nImage.\nThe PDC sought to attract a younger audience of all genders for darts and market the game as a night out rather than just as a sporting event. Through the years, it was not uncommon to see politicians, musicians, football players, boxers and other sporting personalities attending their events. The British Darts Organisation have subsequently sought to emulate most of these innovations.\nPlayers enter matches with their own signature theme music whilst flanked by security men and, until 2017, female valets down to the oche. A \"big-time\" atmosphere was also created by using smoke machines and pyrotechnics during these sometimes elaborate entrances, similar to those used in boxing or wrestling.\nAt the oche, players only drink iced water during matches. Though this was intended to further the game's image, which had been tarnished by players' reputation for consuming large quantities of alcohol. The water is also needed to prevent dehydration: with the many lights and packed crowds, temperatures have been measured at over 38-degree Celsius (100-degree Fahrenheit) during some games.\nInside the venues, action is relayed via giant video screens for the large crowds. The BDO now also has video screens, while maintaining their traditional \"light boards\" of lightbulbs, showing where each dart lands for the benefit of the crowd.\nNicknames.\nEric Bristow, the most successful player in the first few years of the World Championship, had his nickname \"The Crafty Cockney\" emblazoned on the back of his shirt. Very few dart players had their own nicknames until the Professional Darts Corporation circuit made it almost customary for every player to acquire a nickname. This helps to create a new generation of characters with which its audience could identify.\nSky TV commentator Sid Waddell attempted to christen Phil Taylor \"The Crafty Potter\" – referring to him being both a protégé of Bristow and originating from the Potteries. However, the tag never caught on and it was not until a later tournament that he came out to the tune \"The Power\" by Snap! that his nickname was accidentally born.\nJamie Harvey from Scotland became \"Bravedart\" – a play on words from Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart\" film. Sky Sports even filmed vignettes where a kilt wearing Jamie had his face painted blue and ran through woods throwing his darts whilst looking menacing.\nAs the only player to wear a shirt, tie and waistcoat whilst playing, Rod Harrington's \"Prince of Style\" tag appeared apt.\nThough originally from the BDO circuit, Wayne Mardle is known as \"Hawaii Five-O-One\" due to his colourful Hawaiian shirts (a play on words on \"Hawaii Five-O\" and the starting score in a leg of darts).\nBob Anderson, now living in Clevedon in Somerset, is known as The Limestone Cowboy, after the limestone hills of Wiltshire where Bob used to live, and the fact that he enjoys Country and Western music. This was once taken even further, with Anderson once walking to the stage accompanied by a horse.\nCurrent tournaments.\nThe Professional Darts Corporation has continued to increase its annual UK televised tournaments in recent years: The World Championship, The Premier League, World Cup of Darts, World Grand Prix and World Matchplay are all covered live by Sky Sports. The US Open was shown on Challenge in 2007 and Nuts TV in 2008. Bravo broadcast the European Championships for the first time in 2010, after ITV4 televised the first running in 2008. ITV4 won back the coverage for the European Championship; they also show live coverage of the World Series of Darts, Players Championship, UK Open and the Masters.\nRanked tournaments.\nWorld Championship.\nThe World Championship is a single-elimination seeded tournament beginning in mid December and finishing in early January. It is the biggest of the PDC tournaments and has the largest prize fund of any darts competition. Held at the Circus Tavern, Purfleet between 1994 and 2007, the championship moved to a bigger venue at Alexandra Palace from 2008.\nPhil Taylor has dominated this tournament, reaching the final for the first 14 years between 1994 and 2007 and winning fourteen titles, including eight successive titles between 1995 and 2002. The PDC World Champions have also shared eight BDO World Championships between them, with Van Barneveld winning four, Taylor two, and Part and Priestley one each. These are usually added to each player's haul when describing their achievements – hence Taylor is a 16-time champion, van Barneveld 5, Part 3 and Priestley 2.\nPrevious Winners (1994–2023)\nUK Open.\nHeld each year in June at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton (2003–2013), and from 2014 in March at Butlins, Minehead, the UK Open is played over three days with 168 players in a single elimination tournament. After each round a draw is held where there is no protection for seeded players. This has earned it the nickname The FA Cup of darts. Phil Taylor is the most successful player in the tournament's history, with five victories.\nPrevious Winners (2003–24)\nWorld Matchplay.\nCrowds exceeding 2,000 in number assemble at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool, the longest serving venue in the PDC. Matches are contested over legs rather than sets, presenting the prospect of some surprising results and upsets. Phil Taylor has been the dominant player in this event, winning 16 titles and being undefeated in his first 15 finals.\nPrevious Winners (1994–2023)\nWorld Grand Prix.\nThe World Grand Prix replaced the World Pairs event in 1998. Its original venue was the Casino Rooms in Rochester, Kent until 1999, with one staging in Rosslare in 2000 before moving in 2001 to its current home at the CityWest Hotel in Dublin, Ireland. However, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament has been back in England since 2020.\nThis tournament has shorter opening rounds and players must commence and finish each leg on a double including the option of the bull, which is a format not used in any other major televised event. Taylor has dominated the event since its inception, with 11 victories.\nPrevious Winners (1998–2023)\nGrand Slam of Darts.\nIntroduced in 2007, the Grand Slam was the first tournament staged in the UK to feature players from the two different organisations, the PDC and BDO. Players who had reached the finals of each organisations major tournaments for the previous two years were invited to compete in the Grand Slam. It is held over 9 days during November and shown live on Sky Sports. The first four tournaments were shown live on ITV4, and the 2007 Grand Slam of Darts was ITV's first networked darts tournament since ending its darts coverage in 1988.\nPrevious Winners (2007–23)\nPlayers Championship Finals.\nIntroduced in 2009, this tournament was open to the top 32 players on the Players Championship Order of Merit until 2015. In 2016 the tournament was expanded to 64 players still using the Players Championship Order of Merit. It is broadcast live on ITV4.\nPrevious Winners (2009–23)\nEuropean Championship.\nThe European Championship is a tournament that allows the top players in Europe to compete against the top players in the PDC Order of Merit. In 2016 it changed to the top 32 in the European tour Order of Merit. It started in 2008 and for the first six years had a £200,000 prize fund. It has increased since then. Phil Taylor won the first four editions of the tournament, before Simon Whitlock scooped his first, and so far only, major title in 2012.\nPrevious Winners (2008–23)\nNon-ranked tournaments.\nThe Masters.\nThe Masters is a non-ranking darts tournament featuring the Top 24 players in the world, from the PDC Order of Merit. The first event was held between 1–3 November 2013 at the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, Scotland. Since 2015 it has been held at the Marshall Arena, Milton Keynes and been the first tournament after the World Championship.\nPrevious Winners (2013–24)\nPremier League Darts.\nIn 2005, Sky Sports launched the Premier League Darts television programme. For five months, ten of the biggest names from the PDC circuit compete in a league table, with matches held across the country at different venues. Phil Taylor topped the table after the weekly rounds for the first eight instances the Premier League has been staged, going on to win the play-offs six times. Taylor's reign ended when Michael van Gerwen joined the league in 2013 and topped the table after the weekly rounds in each of the seven times since, winning five times. Glen Durrant was the third player to top the table, doing so in his debut year in 2020. Jonny Clayton became the fourth in 2022.\nPrevious Winners (2005–23)\nWorld Series of Darts.\nThe World Series of Darts is a series of tournaments taking place on various continents. These tournaments are non-ranked. The field of players usually exists out of a number of eight PDC top-players participating on invitation, complemented by another eight national qualifiers. Since 2015, the players earn points over the tour to compete in the World Series of Darts Finals at the end of the year.\nPrevious Winners (2015–23)\nWorld Cup of Darts.\nOne of three new tournaments for 2010, players from 24 countries compete for a prize fund of £150,000. The qualifiers are drawn from the PDC Order of Merit. Sky Sports screen the tournament, which rivals the WDF World Cup. England and the Netherlands have won the title on four occasions, with the pairing of Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis triumphant each time for England, and Raymond van Barneveld being involved in all four Dutch wins. In 2019, Scotland became just the third nation to lift the trophy with a victory over the Republic of Ireland in the final. Wales became the fourth winning nation in 2020, when they whitewashed England in the final, and Australia became the fifth and first non-European nation to win the event in 2022.\nPrevious Winners (2010, 2012–2023)\nPDC World Youth Championship.\nThe second of the new tournaments for 2010 was open to all darts players, from both the BDO and PDC, aged between 18 and 21. The final was televised live on Sky Sports at Alexandra Palace before the final of the World Championship, in later years before the final of the Premier League. The two finalists will also be invited to become PDC ProTour card holders and would receive sponsorship from Rileys Dartzones, the PDC's staging partners in this event. They will also be invited to compete in the Grand Slam of Darts. In 2015 the age limit was changed to under 23.\nDimitri Van den Bergh became the first player to defend his title by beating Martin Schindler in the final 6–3 though he could not retain it for a third time due to his age.\nPrevious Winners (2011–23)\nWomen's World Matchplay.\nAs part of their ever increasing support of the women's game, the PDC unveiled the Women's World Matchplay, a tournament for the Top 8 ladies on the PDC Women's Series Order of Merit. The tournament was played on the same day as the final of the main World Matchplay.\nPrevious Winners (2022–2023)\n! Titles\n! Name\n! Years won"
