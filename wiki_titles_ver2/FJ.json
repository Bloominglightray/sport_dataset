World record holder Aries Merritt was here, just days before a scheduled kidney transplant.\nThe heats will be remembered for the false start disqualification of Ronnie Ash.

Dimitri Bascou was the next to show a microscopic lead which only lasted until he clobbered the third hurdle, giving world #2 Omar McLeod three steps in the lead until he flipped the fourth hurdle. Merritt and Sergey Shubenkov were the next leaders. Merritt seemed to be running too close to the hurdles and had to slow to compensate giving Shubenkov a slight edge. Hansle Parchment built up speed and even though he hit the tenth hurdle, had more speed to the finish. \nHis late rush passed Merritt to earn silver and make for a challenge to Shubenkov for the gold. Shubenkov's 12.98 was a new Russian National Record. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advanced to the Semifinals.

        "text": "The women's 100 metres hurdles at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 27 and 28 August.\nSummary.\nBrianna Rollins of the United States entered the competition as the defending champion. Coming into this meet, on paper, this was an American event as eight of the top ten athletes in the world were Americans, but even with the returning champion, only four could compete here. The returning silver medalist, reigning Olympic Champion and two-time winner Sally Pearson could not return due to a tragic accident in Rome, so the best the world could offer was returning bronze medalist Tiffany Porter. But the hurdles require execution.\nTwo of the Americans disappeared in the semi-finals, Kendra Harrison by false start, 2008 Olympic Champion Dawn Harper-Nelson falling flat at the second hurdle. Making the finals were Rollins, after a tight battle with Andrea Ivančević and world #1 Sharika Nelvis, along with Porter and Jamaica's version of the Williams sisters, Danielle and Shermaine. Danielle along with Alina Talay and Cindy Roleder had to run personal bests just to make it into the finals.\nIn the final, Rollins was clearly the first to the first hurdle, however when she got to the first hurdle she didn't lift her lead leg high enough to clear it instead firmly hitting it with her foot and riding it down. That slight delay gave Danielle the narrow lead, chased by Porter and Nelvis. Porter started to move ahead and Rollins started to come back. At the ninth hurdle, Porter began to lose her balance putting Williams back in the lead. Bracketing the field, Talay in lane 2 and Roleder in lane 8 were running error free races away from the fireworks in the middle of the track. By the sixth hurdle, Talay was almost even with Rollins, while Roleder, last over the first hurdle, was steadily gaining. Coming over the final barrier, Roleder clearly took it the smoothest and had the strongest run to the finish. A perfectly timed lean almost caught Williams. In contrast, the off balance Porter lunged at Rollins way too early and tumbled to the track with a full somersault, while Talay efficiently out leaned Rollins for bronze. It was again a significant personal best for all three medalists with Talay's being a new National Record. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nWind: Heat 1: -1.8 m/s, Heat 2: -1.2 m/s, Heat 3: -1.0 m/s, Heat 4: -0.4 m/s, Heat 5: -1.1 m/s.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nWind: Heat 1: -0.3 m/s, Heat 2: -0.4 m/s, Heat 3: -0.8 m/s\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 21:35.\nWind: -0.3 m/s"

        "text": "The men's 400 metres hurdles at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 22, 23 and 25 August.\nSummary.\nWhile Kenya has dominated the longest hurdle race, the 3000 metres steeplechase since the 1968 Olympics, and John Akii-Bua from neighboring Uganda hinted at what might be the capability of East African athletes in this event, Kenya has never had a medalist at 400 hurdles, until this year. Nicholas Bett was the fastest qualifier in the heats. His teammate Boniface Tumuti was the second fastest in the semi-finals, while Bett struggled into the slowest qualifier into the finals. That put Bett almost unnoticed in the far outside lane. Michael Tinsley was the only returning medalist from recent history and the rest of the world leaders were already eliminated, making for a very open race. The fastest 5 finalists all ran their personal best just to make the final race.\nTinsley was the early leader out of the blocks, but was quickly overtaken by Denis Kudryavtsev down the backstretch. Through the turn Tinsley began to hit hurdles, Kudryavtsev the clear leader coming to the straightaway. A couple of meters behind was a wall of Tinsley, Jeffery Gibson and Kerron Clement, with Bett slightly behind them. Kudryavtsev stretched for the ninth hurdle, Tinsley hit it and Bett stormed past. Reminiscent of Kenyan steeplechase finishes, he took the final barrier somewhat awkwardly but continued with so much power that the rest of the field was left behind him. Kudryavtsev held on for silver with a Russian national record. Gibson won the race to the line for bronze, setting his second Bahamian national record of the competition. The once dominant American team, shut out, while Kenya wins its first medal in the event and it was gold. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: Best 4 (Q) and next 4 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 21:15."

The world leader coming into the event was World Junior Champion Shamier Little. While Little had been almost mechanical in winning the NCAA Championships, the US Championships and the Pan American Games over a long season, in this championship she struggled through the rounds, the slowest qualifier in both. Her slow time in the semi relegated her to the inside lane, lane 2 on Beijing's 9 lane track. \nIn the finals, those were the players, with Hejnová in a clear lead by the final turn, with Little and Tate chasing. Hejnová just continued to build her lead unchallenged to the finish, as Little struggled over hurdle 8, stretching to 9 and again awkward at 10. Still Little's strength was able to beat Tate to the line for silver. Sara Petersen made a late rush at Tate coming into the 10th hurdle, but Tate carried her momentum better into the finish to claim bronze.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: Best 4 (Q) and next 4 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: Best 2 (Q) and next 2 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 20:10."

Coming off the race in Monaco, running the #3 non-Kenyan time in history even after falling over the last barrier and losing three to five seconds, Evan Jager had the confidence to run with the Kenyans at the front of the pack. Still, three of the Kenyans in this race were ahead of him on that list. This was a strategic race, with the Kenyan team asserting dominance in front of the pack but not running away from the field. Non-team player, multi-defending champion Ezekiel Kemboi didn't share the lead duties, instead spending the entire first six laps on the rail about 2-3 runners behind the lead. At the bell, Jager took the lead and tried to launch his sprint. As the race accelerated, only the four Kenyans and Brahim Taleb were able to stay at the front. Conseslus Kipruto and Jairus Kipchoge Birech passed Jager a step before the barrier at the beginning of the backstretch. After landing that barrier, defending champion Kemboi took off sprinting passing Jager on the inside and his compatriots on the outside before taking the next barrier clearly in the lead. After opening up a gap through the water jump, Conseslus came back swinging wide on the home stretch looking like he was going to run past Kemboi. Instead Conseslus had to noticeably adjust his stride, taking the final barrier awkwardly. Kemboi took it smoothly and sprinted home to victory, drifting out only to lane 3 this time in celebration. Behind them, Birech took his final barrier awkwardly and Brimin Kipruto caught him for the bronze medal. \nNow 33 years old, Ezekiel Kemboi proved his illustrious career is not over. He became the first person to win an event in the world championships four times in a row. In addition to the four championships in a row, he took the silver medal in the three World Championships before that, silver or gold seven times in a row. Add to that, a pair of Olympic gold medals in the same time frame. And the scenario remains the same, the final lap backstretch burst and a Kipruto struggling over the last barrier while trying to catch up.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: Best 3 (Q) and next 6 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 21:15."

That race was won by Habiba Ghribi in the world leading time. This final was going to be slower and tactical, everybody was watching each other. A lap into the race, Lalita Babar broke away, building up a 10 to 15 meter gap on the pack. She was treated as a breakaway in a bicycle racing, but the peloton didn't give chase. With 2 laps to go, the pack led by Emma Coburn swallowed up the lead and went past. For the next lap, the pack was content to let Coburn lead, Ghribi coming up to her shoulder and the rest going sometimes five abreast over the barriers. At the bell, Ghribi took the lead, Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi and Coburn battling down the backstretch. Going into the final water jump Jepkemoi finally passed Coburn, with Gesa Felicitas Krause and Sofia Assefa forming a tight pack of five to sprint for the medals. As Krause pressed Ghribi from the inside, Jepkemoi had to swing wide out to lane two to find some running room. Krause took the lead over the final barrier as Ghribi stuttered. Ghribi was stronger to take the lead back from Krause but Jepkemoi ran past both of them on the outside and on to victory. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 21:00."

In the heats, Canada, the Netherlands and Trinidad and Tobago set National Records to get to the finals, T&amp;T did so while resting anchor runner Semoy Hackett for the finals. Jamaica rested two, Veronica Campbell-Brown and Elaine Thompson, but not their superstar Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, in order to make six girls eligible for medals. Jamaica was the number one qualifier. USA ran their A team, to assure qualification but not resting their workhorse Allyson Felix even though Tori Bowie, Dezerea Bryant and Kaylin Whitney had been listed as their entries, unlisted Jasmine Todd anchored.\nIn the finals Jamaica was out early with Campbell-Brown and a quick handoff to Natasha Morrison. Kseniya Ryzhova left too early and Russia never made a handoff, while USA looked to proportionally hold their own against the stagger through the backstretch with Felix. Trinidad and Tobago was also in position, while Dafne Schippers ran past Canada's Kimberly Hyacinthe on the outside. Jamaica continued to build their lead with Elaine Thompson through the tour, handing off smoothly to Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in first place, who further extended their lead. USA was a clear second and Trinidad and Tobago clearly third, each with enough separation that places would not change to the finish. Behind them, the Netherlands was just slightly ahead of the British and German teams. Desiree Henry ran away from the others and was closing on Hackett, while the Dutch team's illegal handover earned them a disqualification.\nThe Jamaican team set a new National Record and the Championship Record, Trinidad and Tobago improved theirs from earlier in the day and the British team set their National Record. In all, five teams set their National Record.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 of each heat (Q) plus the 2 fastest times (q) advance to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 20:45."

Botswana showed immense raw talent but in severe need of coaching in the finesse of running competitive relays. Elite American high school teams like Long Beach Poly, where Bryshon Nellum attended, would have been taught how to deal with handoff traffic and Botswana should have qualified.\nIn the finals, the first legs between Trinidad and Tobago (Renny Quow), Great Britain (Rabah Yousif) and USA (David Verburg) were relatively close, exchanging in that order. France, Belgium and Jamaica were all close in the mix. American Tony McQuay sped around the turn before the break and got enough of a lead to shut the door on the other teams, gaining a couple of metres as they dropped back to regroup and try to pass. Lalonde Gordon was able to put T&amp;T slightly ahead at the handoff with a gap back to Great Britain and France, with Jamaica a few steps further behind. Down the backstretch Rusheen McDonald brought Jamaica around into third. As he paid for his efforts on the home stretch, he served as a blockade for Britain and France, Kevin Borlée brought Belgium around the outside into third by the handoff. On the front, Deon Lendore, chased by Nellum stayed relatively even, with 400 finalist Machel Cedenio taking the baton ahead of 400 silver medalist LaShawn Merritt. Merritt fell in behind Cedenio, who he had beaten by a second and a half four days earlier, to strategically prepare for a final pass. Javon Francis brought Jamaica all the way from fifth place to sprinting past the lead duo on the backstretch. Merritt went around Cedenio and started moving in on Francis for that final move. Coming onto the home stretch, Merritt executed his best move on Francis leaving him behind while Martyn Rooney was edging up on Cedenio. Francis, paying for his early speed, began to look like slow motion while everybody else was in real time. Merritt went on to victory, Cedenio separated from Rooney and sped past Francis for silver, and just at the line, Rooney was able to dip past Francis for bronze so close it took the photo finish readers a minute to determine.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 of each heat (Q) plus the 2 fastest times (q) advance to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 20:25"

        "text": "The women's 4 × 400 metres relay at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 29 and 30 August.\nSummary.\nThe Jamaican team announced their intention to win this race early in the championships by placing all four of their relay team members in the top six of the final of the 400 metres. The American squad had two women in that same race, one of them the winner Allyson Felix. Their ace in the hole was having the top two in the world, prior to the American championships, fail to make the individual event but were available for the relay. Both Olympic Champion Sanya Richards-Ross and World Indoor Champion Francena McCorory demonstrated their occasional ability to run excellent 350 meter races in that meet, their flailing last 50 metres is why they didn't qualify for the individual race. All the other teams ran their season best just to make the finals, Bahamas and Japan set National Records and still failed to qualify.\nIn the final, it was a reminder of 2008 on this same track as Richards-Ross was out aggressively, making up the stagger on Christine Ohuruogu and when she hit the home stretch, she was out of gas. Meanwhile, to their outside, Christine Day was running smoothly to give Jamaica a big lead, Shericka Jackson. Natasha Hastings ran a quick turn to barely hold off Anyika Onuora at the break. Jackson started her leg conservatively, so the gap looked manageable, until she started cranking and the lead gap started growing. Jamaica had an almost two second lead when Jackson handed off to Stephenie Ann McPherson, Hastings helped the USA hold off the British team before handing off to the American's star, Felix. The gap looked impossible at the beginning but Felix closed it down. It took Felix 350 metres to catch McPherson, but it was a steady race throughout and when Felix got there she just continued on by, handing off to world #3 Francena McCorory with the lead. Jamaica had Novlene Williams-Mills on the anchor leg, starting 2 metres down. Down the backstretch and into the final turn, McCorory held the same gap on Williams-Mills, then through the turn the gap started to widen. Onto the home stretch, Williams-Mills moved out to lane 2 to look for running room. 70 metres before the finish, McCorory's arm movement got bigger but her legs got noticeably slower. Williams-Mills cruised on by a helpless McCorory with powerful sprint form across the line for gold. Well behind the leaders, the British team was challenged by Nigeria until Patience Okon George met with a similar collapse. While Seren Bundy-Davies carried the British home for bronze, George was overtaken at the line by Russia's Kseniya Aksyonova. \nFelix's remarkable leg was timed at 47.72, the fastest of her already brilliant history in that category and the third fastest women's relay leg ever measured, just .02 off the fastest measured electronically.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 2 of each heat (Q) plus the 2 fastest times (q) advance to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 20:05"

        "text": "The men's decathlon at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 28 and 29 August.\nThe overwhelming favorite here had to be the World Record Holder, Olympic Champion and defending Champion, Ashton Eaton. This was Eaton's first decathlon of the year. American Trey Hardee entered as the world leader. Pan American Games and Commonwealth Games champion and returning bronze medalist Damian Warner and returning silver medalist and Götzis winner Michael Schrader were also medal contenders.\nEaton won the first event, the 100 metres in 10.23, a World Championship Decathlon best and #139 in the world, but slightly off world record pace. Warner, Rico Freimuth, and Felipe Dos Santos were right behind him in that fourth heat. In the long jump, again Eaton led, his 7.88 slightly off world record pace and behind his seasonal best but still equal to the #93 jump in the world. Schrader was the second best jumper of the day but Dos Santos held on to third place.\nFreimuth took over third place by winning the shot put in 15.50, Eaton's 14.52 a foot improvement over world record pace. A 2.10 high jump moved Kurt Felix into third position, while Eaton's 2.01 lost a little ground to the world record.\nIn the 400 metres, Eaton set a World Decathlon Best at 45.00 seconds. It was equal to the #34 time in the world. This was Eaton's third World Decathlon Best after the 100 metres and Long Jump he set during his world record in Eugene in 2012. The 400 was also a 1.70 second improvement over his world record pace. Freimuth moved back into third place.\nAt the end of the first day, Eaton held a 173-point advantage over Warner, with three Germans, Freimuth, Kai Kazmirek and Schrader bunched behind.\nThe second day began with Warner running the 110 metres hurdles in 13.63, equal to the #100 time in the world, with Eaton right with him in 13.69 (#110 in the world) and Freimuth next in the same race. Eaton only gained .01 over record pace.\nFreimuth won the discus with a 50.17, Eaton's 43.34 gained a half a metre on the world record. Eaton's 5.20 pole vault lost 10 cm to the world record, Ilya Shkurenyov used the same height to move up to fourth place. But the world record became a possibility when Eaton's 63.63 season best improved almost 5 meters on his world record pace. Simply a solid 1500 metres could do it.\nIn the 1500, Eaton had a perfect pace set by Larbi Bourrada who was in the process of setting the African Record, tying up at the end he crossed in 4:17.52, 3 seconds slower than Eugene but good enough for a 6-point world record improvement. 350 points behind, Warner improved upon his Canadian Record for silver. Freimuth continued to the bronze, Bouraada got fifth place with his record and in eighth place Felix improved his Grenadian National Record.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\n100 metres.\nThe 100 metres was held on 28 August at 09:00.\nLong jump.\nThe long jump was held on 28 August at 10:05.\nShot put.\nThe shot put was held on 28 August at 11:55.\nHigh jump.\nThe high jump was held on 28 August at 16:15.\n400 metres.\nThe 400 metres was held on 28 August at 20:20.\n110 metres hurdles.\nThe 110 metres hurdles was held on 29 August at 09:00.\nDiscus throw.\nThe discus throw was held on 29 August at 10:05.\nPole vault.\nThe pole vault was held on 29 August at 13:15.\nJavelin throw.\nThe javelin throw was held on 29 August at 17:00.\n1500 metres.\nThe 1500 metres was held on 29 August at 20:10.\nFinal standings.\n\"After all events.\""

        "text": "The women's heptathlon at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 22 and 23 August.\nSummary.\nHanna Kasyanova (née Melnychenko) of Ukraine entered the competition as defending champion, although the favourite for the competition was the silver medalist of 2013 World Championships Brianne Theisen-Eaton who is the world leader by a margin of more than 250 points. Other potential winners and medalists were 2009 World and 2012 Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, returning from giving birth to her first child, 2015 European pentathlon champion and 2014 world number one Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Nadine Broersen, Carolin Schäfer, Barbara Nwaba, Nadine Visser and Nafissatou Thiam.\nThe returning champion Kasyanova did not start. The American champion Nwaba fell out of contention from the gun of the first race, misstepping the first hurdle and falling at the next. Meanwhile, Olympic champion Ennis-Hill made it clear she was intending to take this championship. Visser started strongly with two personal bests, her 12.81 hurdles just missing the national record that is almost 6 years older than she is. Johnson-Thompson joined her hyphenated British teammate in the medal hunt with a 1.89 high jump and a 200 metres win and personal bests in the other two events. Lurking in fourth place after the first day was returning silver medalist and world leader Theisen-Eaton who had been struggling through her last couple of events.\nAs the second day began, Theisen-Eaton excelled in the long jump while Johnson-Thompson was unable to land a legal jump, taking her out of the hunt and reshuffling the top athletes. Also joining the medal hunt was the top long jumper of the day, Claudia Rath. Anastasiya Mokhnyuk moved into the third-place position while Ennis-Hill's lead was over a hundred points. The javelin throw is not a strong event for any of the jumpers allowing strong throwers Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa and the other Dutch Nadine Broersen to move up into the top four. Theisen-Eaton injured her groin during the javelin but made it to the start line of the final event intending to run for a medal. Theisen-Eaton ran hard at the front of the final group, chased only by Ennis-Hill, the pair clearly outdistancing the rest of the leader group. But Ennis-Hill was not just satisfied by winning on points, she stamped an exclamation point on the win by marking Theisen-Eaton to the final straight then sprinting past. Ikauniece-Admidiņa held on to third place with her Latvian National Record while Boersen and Mokhnyuk suffered several seconds further back. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\n100 metres hurdles.\nThe 100 metres hurdles was held on 22 August at 09:00.\nHigh jump.\nThe high jump was started on 22 August at 10:20.\nShot put.\nThe shot put was held on 22 August at 18:30.\n200 metres.\nThe 200 metres were held on 22 August at 20:15.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: +0.4, Heat 2: −1.3, Heat 3: +0.8, Heat 4: +0.2 m/s.\nLong jump.\nThe long jump was started on 23 August at 09:00.\nJavelin throw.\nThe javelin throw was started on 23 August at 10:50.\n800 metres.\nThe 800 metres were held on 23 August at 19:40.\nFinal standings.\n\"After all events.\""

        "title": "History of the Wales national rugby union team (2004–present)",
        "text": "The history of the Wales national rugby union team from 2005 to present (note that, as of September 2019, and despite reaching Number One in the Men's World Rugby Rankings for the first time in history, for a period of two weeks in late August 2019, the rest of this article barely goes beyond 2015) covers a period where the side won four Grand Slams in the Six Nations Championship, as well as another Championship victory. The Grand Slams, in all the tournament matches, were achieved in 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2019. Their other Six Nations Championship, in 2013, was won without achieving a Grand Slam. The country has not enjoyed as much success against the major southern hemisphere opposition of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. New Zealand have not been defeated by Wales since 1953, and South Africa have only been defeated five times since 2005: a 12–6 victory in 2014, a 27–13 victory in 2016, a 24–22 victory in 2017, a 24–22 victory in Washington DC in 2018 followed by a 20–11 win in Cardiff in 2018. Wales defeated Australia in November 2005, and also in November 2008. Following this, Wales suffered a thirteen-match losing streak to the Wallabies. This ended in 2018, when Wales defeated Australia 9–6.\nWales were defeated by Fiji in a crucial 2007 Rugby World Cup match, which saw the side eliminated from the tournament in pool play. They had greater success in 2011, where they progressed to the semi-finals and faced France. They were eliminated in a 9–8 loss, and eventually finished fourth in the tournament, their best World Cup result since 1987.\nHistory.\nCoached by Mike Ruddock, Wales won their first Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005. They opened with an 11–9 win over England at the Millennium Stadium, thanks to a late long range penalty from Gavin Henson. After a 38–8 win over Italy, Wales faced France, and were behind 15–6 at half-time. Wales fought back in the second half to win 24–18, and the game was arguably one of the most exciting of that year's tournament. Wales beat Scotland away (46–22) and then, in front of a capacity crowd at the Millennium Stadium, played their final game against Ireland. Wales' 32–20 victory gave them their first championship title since 1994 and their first Grand Slam since 1978.\nThe 41–3 loss to the All Blacks at the Millennium Stadium later that year was their biggest loss on Welsh soil. This was followed by a single-point win over Fiji, then a loss to South Africa, and lastly a win over Australia.\nOn 14 February 2006, midway through the Six Nations, Mike Ruddock resigned as the head coach of Wales, for family reasons. Scott Johnson took over as caretaker coach for the remaining games, and Wales eventually finished fifth in the 2006 Championship before Gareth Jenkins was appointed as head coach on 27 April. On 10 May 2007, Wales and Australia decided to celebrate 100 years of Test rugby between the two countries with the establishment of the James Bevan Trophy. It is named after the Australian-born Welsh-raised man who was Welsh team's first captain; Australia won the series 2–0.\nThe revival stuttered at the 2007 World Cup, as Wales failed to advance beyond the pool stage following a loss to Fiji. Coach Gareth Jenkins subsequently lost his job, and Warren Gatland, a New Zealander and former All Black, was appointed as Wales' new head coach on 9 November 2007. He had previously coached New Zealand province Waikato – leading them to success in the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup. His inaugural match as coach was Wales' first match of the 2008 Six Nations Championship, against England at Twickenham. England were favourites and led by 13 points at half-time, before Wales fought back to win 26–19 – their first victory at Twickenham since 1988. Wales went unbeaten throughout the tournament, and won their second Grand Slam in four Championships after defeating France 29–12 at the Millennium Stadium. Wales conceded only two tries in the entire tournament, halving the previous record of four tries conceded by England in both 2002 and 2003.\nIn the 2008 end-of-year Tests Wales were defeated by both New Zealand and South Africa, but claimed wins over Canada and Australia. Wales' 21–18 victory made them the only Northern Hemisphere nation to defeat a Tri-Nations country in 2008, and sent them up to fifth in the world rankings and later fourth. Wales failed to retain their Six Nations Championship in 2009 after losing 17–15 to Ireland on the last day. The defeat gave Ireland the Grand Slam, and left Wales fourth on points difference despite their three wins.\nAt the 2011 World Cup, Wales defeated Fiji, Namibia and Samoa, only narrowly losing to South Africa at the pool stages. In the quarter-finals, they faced Ireland, beating them 22–10, hence reaching the semi-finals for the first time since 1987. It was at the semi-final stage that Wales came up short by the narrowest of margins, losing 9–8 to France after a red card for captain Sam Warburton in the 18th minute.\nOn 17 March 2012, Wales completed their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, with a 16–9 victory over France at the Millennium Stadium in the 2012 Six Nations Championship. The victory over France was seen, by many, as the ultimate revenge for their narrow world cup semi-final defeat. After the 2012 Grand Slam Wales suffered 8 consecutive defeats (4 versus Australia), including a record run of 5 home defeats. The losing streak was broken in round 2 of the 2013 Six Nations Championship with Wales beating France 16–6 in Paris. On 9 March 2013 versus Scotland, Wales achieved a record fifth consecutive away win in the Six Nations. Wales retained the Six Nations Championship after beating England in their final match by a record winning margin 30–3. This was the first time Wales had retained the Championship since their 1978/1979 championship wins.\nDespite these results, Wales was 9th in the World Rankings in December 2012. Therefore, the team was placed in Pot 3 of the pool stage draw for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Wales was drawn in Pool A with Australia and England, which the press described as the group of death."

        "text": "The men's marathon at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 22 August.\nThe name Gebrselassie is familiar in running circles, but this race was won by Haile's sound alike Ghirmay Ghebreslassie from a different country, neighboring Eritrea. Not only was he the youngest winner of a World Championship marathon, he was the first gold medalist for his country ever.\nThe early leader was Ser-Od Bat-Ochir, then Daniele Meucci and Ruggero Pertile getting camera time to the half way mark while the favorites including defending champion Stephen Kiprotich stayed slightly off the pace. Ghebreslassie marked the more experienced runners. Tsepo Ramonene made a breakaway at 25 km opening up a 30-second lead. As he watched two Kenyans drop out and other favorites struggle, Ghebreslassie decided to set loose at 34 km. Over the next couple of kilometers, he made up the gap and passed Ramonene with authority. But a couple of kilometers later Yemane Tsegay passed Ghebreslassie. Tsegay's lead only lasted two minutes until Ghebreslassie took the lead for good. Over the final kilometers, he extended his lead to 40 seconds. Running relaxed and fast like an exuberant teenager, he was handed an Eritrean flag as he entered the stadium. \nHe held his flag but kept on running past the finish line until officials were able to tell him he was done. “I’ve never finished in a stadium before.” Behind him, in comparison, Tsegay, Solomon Mutai and the other runners finished looking as if they had just finished a marathon.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nThe race was started at 07:35."

        "text": "The women's marathon at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 30 August.\nSummary.\nUnder overcast skies the race quickly formed two large packs of about 20 runners. For the next 25K, the lead pack remained about the same size with some runners bridging the gap in time for others to fall off the pace. Between 25K and 30K, the pack dropped to a dozen runners. Just after 31K, defending champion Edna Kiplagat accelerated. In the next 4K, the lead pack cut in half, the remaining athletes were three Kenyans, two Ethiopians and Eunice Kirwa wearing a Bahrain uniform, from Kenya. London Marathon champion Tigist Tufa was the first to fall back, then Kiplagat began to lose contact. But the four person pack remained tougher into the stadium. Four athletes to sprint it out on the track for three medals after running 26 miles. Mare Dibaba (no relation to the other famous Dibaba sisters) led the group toward the tunnel. As they started to speed up, Jemima Sumgong did not have another gear. Kirwa was perfectly positioned to strike but instead Helah Kiprop launched the attack from the back after looking like she was ready to drop off, long striding behind the diminutive Dibaba. 60 metres before the finish they were almost even, but Dibaba would not give that last few inches. \nThen Dibaba sped away to cross the line with almost 7 metres gap. The times had a second between first and second, a four-second gap amongst the medalists and a 7-second gap back to fourth place. On every count, the closest Marathon finish in World Championship history.\nIt was four Kenyan born athletes in places 2–5, Ethiopia and Japan placed three each in the top 14 places.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nThe race was started at 07:30."

        "text": "Sean Michael White (born November 10, 1995) is an American football quarterback who formerly played for the Auburn Tigers. White ranks third in Auburn history for career passing efficiency and fourth in completion percentage.\nEarly years.\nWhite attended Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School in Hollywood, Florida for his first 3 years of high school before transferring to University School of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for his senior year. White finished his high school career with over 8,300 yards and 107 total TDs. The summer before his senior season, White won the Elite 11 QB competition, despite several future NFL starters attending such as Deshaun Watson, Kyle Allen, DeShone Kizer, and Will Grier. He passed for 2,679 yards and 30 touchdowns as a senior, earning 1st-Team All Broward County honors. He was the MVP of the 2014 Under Armour All-America Game after completing 10 of 12 passes for 156 yards with a touchdown. White was rated as a four-star recruit by Rivals.com and was ranked among the top quarterbacks in his class. He committed to Auburn University to play college football.\nCollege career.\nWhite redshirted his first year at Auburn in 2014. He started his redshirt freshman year in 2015 as the backup to Jeremy Johnson. After three games, Johnson was benched and White was named the starter. White started his first college game vs Mississippi State. White started a total of six games in 2015. He became the first freshman QB in Auburn history to throw for 250 or more yards in three straight games, doing so against Kentucky, Arkansas, and Ole Miss. Injuries to left knee and foot caused White to miss the final games of the regular season. White finished the year with 1,167 passing yards, one touchdown pass against four interceptions, and a 58 percent completion percentage.\nIn 2016, White battled Jeremy Johnson and John Franklin III for the starting quarterback job. On August 25, 2016, White was named the starting quarterback by head coach Gus Malzahn. White played in 11 games, including a mid-season 6 game winning streak that pushed Auburn to 7-2 and inside the top 10 (#9). After 10 weeks, White had the #3 comp pct in the FBS, heading into Auburn’s annual rivalry with Georgia. A shoulder injury early derailed that game and subsequently the 2016 season. White returned to play in the Sugar Bowl against Baker Mayfield and Oklahoma, but a broken arm caused White to be replaced in the second quarter. White finished 2016 with 1,679 passing yards, 9 touchdowns, 3 interceptions, and a 63.9 completion percentage. \nIn 2017, White, injured with the broken arm for Spring practice, lost the position of starting quarterback to Baylor transfer Jarrett Stidham.\nOn September 18, 2017, White was dismissed from the team following a public intoxication arrest.\nStatistics\nControversy.\nWhite was arrested and charged with public intoxication shortly before 3 a.m. on Homecoming Night, September 17, 2017. Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn dismissed White from the team the next day, stating: \"He has made poor decisions that are not in the best interest of our program, and more importantly, himself.\" In February 2018, a municipal court judge in the city of Auburn dismissed the public intoxication charge against White.\nPersonal life.\nAfter leaving Auburn, White was left with several injuries and despite offers to join other P5 programs, decided to retire from football and obtain his finance degree from Florida International University. He graduated \"magna cum laude\", and lives in Boston, MA."

A † denotes a recognised, but unofficial match that did not contribute to the IRL World Rankings.\nMay.\nPapua New Guinea vs Fiji men in Australia.\nThe 2016 Melanesian Cup was played between Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Papua New Guinea created history to win their first Melanesian Cup title. The test looked in a similar situation to last year when Fiji took a comfortable lead into the break but this time around Papua New Guinea scored enough points in the second half to outscore their pacific rivals and win their first major title since the 2009 Pacific Cup. Captain David Mead shone for the Kumuls as he made try-saving tackles, assists and even line breaks in a man-of-the-match performance which was a crucial influence to earning his country's first win on away soil since the year 2000. Fiji picked 7 débutantes for the test match, while PNG featured five players making their first ever International appearance for their country. Both teams had a fair share of NRL, Queensland or New South Wales Cup, as well as domestic club players. Papua New Guinea's most capped player was Rod Griffin who made his 10th appearance for his country, while Fiji's most experienced player was Akuila Uate who made his 12th appearance for his country. Gold Coast's David Mead captained Papua New Guinea, and Port Kembla Blacks' James Storer led Fiji.\nNotes:\nSamoa vs Tonga men in Australia.\nThe 2016 Polynesian Cup was played between Samoa and Tonga. Samoa defeated Tonga to win their second consecutive Polynesian Cup title. The strong crowd would always show their passion and loud screaming support throughout the game after big hits, strong runs and intense moments were key talking points. However a total of 29 errors and a completion rate of just over 50% from both countries was a headache for everyone to watch. Despite Tonga having 55% possession and more territory, they didn't score and the Samoans made them pay by taking their few second-half opportunities that were given to them resulting in another Samoan victory over their old 'War rivals'. Samoa picked 7 débutantes for the test match, while Tonga featured three. Both teams' players varied from National Rugby League players to Queensland or New South Wales Cup to Holden Cup and to the Super League. Samoa's most capped player was Leeson Ah Mau who made his 10th appearance for his country, while Tonga's most experienced player was Feleti Mateo who made his 13th appearance for his country. English Super League club Hull F.C. gave permission for two players to leave England and play in the Polynesian Cup test; coincidentally they were captain of both nations. Frank Pritchard captained Samoa, and Sika Manu led Tonga.\nNotes:\nJune.\nChile vs El Salvador men in Australia.\nNotes\nLebanon men in Italy.\nNotes:\nJuly.\nNorway men in Sweden.\nNotes:\nAmerica's Cup.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nAugust.\nEuropean Triangular Series.\nNotes\nNovember.\nWorld Cup European play-off qualifier.\nWith the win Italy became the 14th, and final, team to qualify for the 2017 World Cup.\nNon-RLIF matches.\nNotes:\nNotes:"

Their primary mission is to \"call honorary attention to those professional female boxers (now retired) along with men and women whose contributions to the sport and its athletes, from outside the ring, have been instrumental in growing female boxing.\"\nHistory.\nThe International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame first surged as an idea in 2013, by Sue TL Fox, the Founder and Creator of Women Boxing Archive Network [WBAN]. That year the WBAN, a website dedicated to women's boxing exclusively, announced that steps were being taken to open the Hall of Fame.\nThe Hall of Fame's first inductee class was announced in April, 2014, and its first induction ceremony took place on July 11, 2014, and was attended by among others, Claressa Shields, women's boxing gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympic Games.\nOn July 4, 2021, the International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame announced that the event that takes place on August 14, 2021, at the Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino, in Las Vegas, Nevada, has been declared a \"Proclamation Day\" by the Honorable Carolyn G.

        "title": "Session (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a session is a period of play during which overs are played continuously until a break in play is called.\nIn Test matches, each of the five potential days of the match typically comprises three main sessions, usually referred to as the morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. The morning and afternoon sessions are usually separated by a 40-minute lunch break, and the afternoon and evening sessions by a 20-minute tea break. Each of the three sessions is approximately 30 overs long, and is broken up further into two to three minor sessions varying in length, separated by drinks breaks. The exact timing of these intra-session breaks is the umpiring team's call.\nIn One Day Internationals, matches are played over two innings, with three sessions in each, usually in lengths of 15, 15, and 20 overs. These three sessions may also contain short drinks breaks. Additionally, day-time ODI matches include a lunch break between the first and second innings. In day-night ODI matches, the lunch break is replaced by a dinner break.\nSessions of play often influence a team's tactics for a match, especially as natural light varies over the course of the day, and the pitch wears over the course of a match, whether one-day or Test. For example, teams usually choose opening Test batsmen who can navigate opening bowlers, who often bowl aggressively in the first session of a Test match. Similarly, Test teams sometimes deploy a nightwatchman during the closing session of a day so as not to lose important wickets in conditions that might be difficult for an incoming batsman to manage."

Hosted by University of Santo Tomas, the UST Glowing Goldies defeated the UE Warriors in a single game finals taking their tenth UAAP men's basketball championship.\nFinals.\nThe University of Santo Tomas displayed a well-knit man-to-man defense to smother the defending champion University of the East, 66–55, and regain the UAAP basketball crown before 9,000 fans at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum.\nIt was the first title for the Goldies after four years of so-so performances. Far Eastern University won it in 1956 and UE took over the next two years. FEU was eliminated by UST in the playoffs, 84–67. The victory was largely the work of two men who spent most of their playing time on the UST bench this season – rangy Asencion Aparicio and ex-Goldie skipper Angel Pavilano – and old reliable and slippery Rosendo Libunao. Established stars of the season – UST's Ramon Cotia and Reynaldo Arenas and UE's Roehl Nadurata, Mario Uson, Herman Dionisio and Tomas Paredes – failed to shake off the jitters. Nadurata, who was usually good for 20 points in tight and crucial matches, was held down to four measly points, all scored from the charity stripe, by the 6’3” Aparicio.\nThe lanky Tommie center didn't only excel in the guarding department. He also spearheaded UST’s offensive by scoring 20 points, two points better than Warriors pointman Rizaldo Pabillore's output. Aparicio was assisted ably by Libunao whose flawless heaves from quartercourt went for 16 points and Pavilano who checked top UE scoring aces Dionisio, Pabillore and Maximiano Concepcion from doing too much damage. This championship was the 10th the Goldies bagged since the loop commenced and, with it, they grabbed the second leg of the three-foot trophy, donated in 1955, that would go to the team that tops the loop thrice."

        "text": "Cycling is a mode of transport in Spain with 20% of the people listing the bicycle as their mode of transport, though some Spanish cities as Valencia, Vitoria and Zaragoza well exceed that with 45%.\nThere is some cycling infrastructure such as cycle paths, cycle tracks, protected intersections, and bicycle parking, but lacks cycle paths in regional and, mainly, national roads.\nOn the other hand, in an overview about the traffic, Spain had 8.1 deaths in annual number of deaths from injuries (unintentional and intentional) among 1 to 14-year-old children during 1991–95, expressed per 100,000 children in the age group.\nA \"Plan Estratégico Estatal de la Bicicleta\" (State Strategy Plan of the Bicycle) has been planned, but only two of the more than forty measures have been approved from the reform of the \"Reglamento General de Circulación\" (National Road Rules).\nSport.\nCycling has been an important sport in Spain since the 1940s. The Vuelta a España (Spanish for \"Tour of Spain\") is one of the most important cycling events in the world, together with the Tour de France (French for \"Tour of France\") and Giro d'Italia (Italian for \"Tour of Italy\") racing tournaments.\nSeveral Spanish cycling athletes have won the Tour de France, including Federico Bahamontes, Luis Ocaña, Pedro Delgado, Óscar Pereiro, Alberto Contador, and Carlos Sastre.\nThe most successful Spanish cyclist is Miguel Indurain. He won the Tour de France in five consecutive years between 1991 and 1995. He also won the Giro d'Italia in two consecutive years (1992 and 1993), the 1995 Road World Championship time trial and the gold medal in the 1996 Olympic time trial.\nMore recently, in 2008, Sastre became the seventh and third consecutive Spaniard to win the Tour de France, then followed by Contador winning his second tour in 2009's edition. Contador was thought to have repeated his win in 2010 but the day before Stage 17, the queen stage finishing with atop the Col du Tourmalet, Contador tested positive for performance-enhancing substance Clenbuterol, although he claimed it was a result of consuming contaminated beef and in January 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled him guilty and gave him a two-year ban backdated from July 21, 2010 and had all his results achieved after July 21 erased, including victory in the 2010 Giro d'Italia and a 5th-place finish and most aggressive rider award for stage 19 at the 2011 Tour de France. Since returning from the ban, Contador has won the Vuelta twice, in 2012 and 2014.\nÓscar Freire shares the distinction of being one of four men to win the World Road Racing Championship three times, as well as being a three-time winner of one of the most prestigious one-day classic cycle races, the Milan–San Remo. Abraham Olano won the Vuelta a España in 1998, and is the only man to win World Championships in both the road race (1995) and time trial (1998).\nSpain has also produced some notable mountain bikers like José Antonio Hermida and track racers like olimpic medalists Joan Llaneras, José Manuel Moreno Periñán, José Antonio Escuredo or Sergi Escobar as well as multi-world champion Guillermo Timoner."

        "title": "Rugby Football League expansion",
        "text": "Since the formation of Super League in 1996, the Rugby Football League (RFL) has continually expanded the top three divisions of rugby league in Britain with an aim to expand the competitions outside the traditional heartlands.\nHistory.\nThroughout the 20th century rugby league had tried to expand outside the heartlands of the M62 corridor without success. Teams such as Liverpool Stanley, Nottingham City and Cardiff all failed. Many see London Broncos as the first successful expansion team because in the 1990s, and in the early years of Super League, they challenged for silverware.\nIn the years leading up to the formation of Super League, teams from outside the heartlands were fast tracked into Super League such as London Broncos and PSG. After the failure of PSG and later Gateshead Thunder, the RFL chose to stop entering teams straight into Super League. The last team to be entered straight into Super League were Catalans Dragons in 2007 and are seen by many as the most successful expansion team.\nSince 2003, expansion teams have been entered into the lower leagues although not all teams have entered at the same level. In 2003 London Skolars were entered in League 1 (division three), whereas Toulouse Olympique were entered into the Championship (division two).\nSince 2010 the RFL has said every new team has to enter from the bottom of the professional pyramid in League 1 and work their way up through all the leagues.\nExpansion clubs.\nPrevious expansion.\nThe first team to be entered into the Super League were Paris Saint-Germain in 1996 who played on the opening night of Super League against Sheffield Eagles in Paris. However the French franchise folded in 1997 after only two seasons competing in Super League. The only team playing outside the heartlands of Yorkshire and Lancashire now was the London Broncos. A new franchise, Gateshead Thunder were chosen to replace PSG in 1999 and had a successful first season finishing 6th, just outside the playoffs. Gateshead left the league after one season to merge with Hull Sharks after just one season. In 2000 a new Gateshead Thunder was formed and were accepted into the National League 2 and were promoted in 2008 but relegated the next season. They then finished bottom of League 1 three years in a row.\nIn 2003 a second London team were formed and accepted into National League 2, London Skolars and have not yet been promoted. In 2005 Blackpool Panthers were accepted into the National League 2 and finished as the wooden-spooners two years in a row. They gradually improved until they folded in 2009.\nNo more Super League franchises were awarded for the next few years with promotion and relegation between the Super League and Championship reintroduced. In 2005 however, a new franchise was awarded to the Catalans Dragons, the second French team to be chosen to play in Super League. Despite finishing bottom of the league in their first season, they were seen as a huge success in Super League and in their second season they became the first French team to reach a Challenge Cup final.\nThe next franchise to be introduced was Welsh team Celtic Crusaders in 2006 to enter into the then National League 2 and the next season they won promotion to the Championship. In only their first season in the Championship their licence to play in Super League was accepted and they made their Super League debut in 2009, becoming the first Welsh team to play in the top division of rugby league in Britain. The Crusaders played in only three seasons in Super League, reaching the playoffs once in 2010, went into administration in 2011 and were later dissolved. During the same period a third French team, Toulouse Olympique were accepted to play in the Championship in 2009 and were largely successful until they were relegated to League 1 in 2011 but chose to return to the French Elite One Championship instead.\nIn 2010 it was announced that all new clubs would enter the pyramid at League 1 (rugby league). The first team to be part of the new expansion plans were South Wales Scorpions in 2010, the second Welsh team to play in the pyramid. A new Welsh team North Wales Crusaders, formed to replace the Celtic Crusaders and won promotion to the Championship in 2013 but were relegated the next season due to the restructure of the professional structure.\nIn 2012 three new clubs were announced as part of the expansion; Hemel Stags, Oxford Rugby League and Cheltenham-based Gloucestershire All Golds. These were the first teams in southern England outside London to play professional rugby league.\nIn 2015, Coventry Bears were accepted to play in League 1 having previously played in the now defunct National League 3 and the Conference League South. The same year Toulouse Olympique were offered a return to England for the 2016 season to play in League 1 and again try to achieve promotion to Super League via the Championship.\nIn April 2016 it was announced Toronto Wolfpack would become the first professional trans-Atlantic sports team. The team, which started play in 2017, has a British base in Bradford and plays home and away games in blocks of five.\nFuture expansion.\nAt the Toronto Wolfpack conference, Toronto CEO Eric Perez said if the Toronto team was successful the plan was to establish a professional team in Montreal and possibly Vancouver with the aim to eventually have professional teams on the East Coast of America in Boston and New York. He said they aim to enter a Montreal franchise in 2019.\nIn late 2016 Manchester Rangers had submitted a bid to enter League 1.\nLondon Chargers have also expressed an interest in joining the professional structure.\nIn January 2017 it was announced an American consortium from Florida were in talks with the RFL to enter a team similar to the Toronto Wolfpack. The club would be based in Jacksonville.\nHemel Stags RFL place was bought out by a Canadian consortium, which plans to move the team to Ottawa, Canada. The team was provisionally accepted to join League 1 for the 2020 season, but they later severed this until the 2021 season. The team is likely to be known as Ottawa Aces. A consortium in New York are also attempting to enter the League in 2021 as well, they would be known as New York City Rugby League.\nThere has also been expressions of interest in joining the RFL system from Spain and Serbia through Valencia Huracanes and Red Star Belgrade RL.\nFailed expansion attempts.\nIn 2013 the Rugby Football League (RFL) picked seven teams to be part of the League 1 expansion. Four of those teams were successful and joined the professional ranks of rugby league. The first of these teams to be accepted were Northampton Rebels who were owned by association football club Northampton Town FC but pulled out after Northampton Town decided they did not want to field a team that had no chance of success.\nChester Gladiators also applied but were unsuccessful despite being very close to the rugby league heartlands as they failed to attract players and fans to join the club. Medway Dragons were one of two clubs based around London to apply, the other being Hemel Stags, and would have joined London Broncos and London Skolars as clubs in the professional structure but pulled out as they chose to continue competing in the London and South League."

        "text": "The 1500 metres at the World Championships in Athletics has been contested by both men and women since the inaugural edition in 1983. It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 1500 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has two qualifying rounds leading to a final between twelve athletes. It is one of two middle-distance running events on the programme, alongside the World Championship 800 metres.\nThe championship records for the event are 3:27.65 minute for men, set by Hicham El Guerrouj in 1999, and 3:51.95 minutes for women, set by Sifan Hassan in 2019. The world record has never been broken or equalled at the competition by either men or women, reflecting the lack of pacemaking and athletes' more tactical approach to championship races.\nHicham El Guerrouj of Morocco is the most successful athlete of the event through his four straight wins from 1997 to 2003, as well as a silver in 1995. The next most successful athlete is Faith Kipyegon, who, in additional to three golds, also has won two silvers between 2015 in 2023, making her the most decorated athlete in terms of overall medals.\nRashid Ramzi is the only athlete to have won both middle-distance titles, having done an 800 m/1500 m double at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics. The first two women's champions Mary Decker and Tatyana Dorovskikh both completed 1500 m/3000 m World Championships doubles, while Bernard Lagat and Faith Kipyegon completed a 1500 m/5000 metres double at respectively the 2007 World Championships and 2023 World Championships. Sifan Hassan is the only athlete to win the 1500 m and the 10000 m in a single championships, doing so in 2019.\nBritish runners Steve Cram, the inaugural men's winner, 2022 champion Jake Wightman and 2023 champion Josh Kerr are the only non-African-born men to win the World Championship event.\nKenya is the most successful nation in the discipline, having won ten gold medals across the men's and women's event. Algeria is next, with five gold medals across the men's and women's event. Morocco and Bahrain each have won four gold medals, while Russia and the United States each have three. The United States has the highest total of medals in the events at twelve, with six in both in the men's and women's divisions. Kenya has the highest number of medals in the men's event, with a total of seven.\nTwo medallists have been stripped of their honours in the event due to doping: 1987 bronze medallist Sandra Gasser and 2007 silver medallist Yelena Soboleva.\nAge records.\n The exact date of birth of the youngest male participant, Yahye Abdi Gurre, is unknown but he remains the youngest given his known year of birth and calculating from 1 January of that year.\nDoping.\nThe 1500 m was the event that first saw the disqualification of a World Championships medallist on the grounds of doping. The 1987 women's bronze medallist Sandra Gasser gave a positive test for anabolic steroids at the competition and received a two-year ban from the sport later that month. Twelve years passed without incident in the event, until the disqualification of the first male 1500 m athlete in 1999: Ibrahim Mohamed Aden was disqualified and given a public warning for ephedrine usage due to failing his post-race test after the semi-finals.\nThe 2003 men's finalist Fouad Chouki was banned for two-years after a positive test for EPO. Chouki lost an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in which he claimed that an unknown person had injected him with EPO in the aftermath of the race. Regina Jacobs (a two-time silver medallist) had her 2003 semi-final performance annulled retrospectively following the BALCO scandal, as later analysis of her sample at the 2003 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships showed usage of the novel steroid THG.\nThe women's World Championships 1500 m was affected by doping for three straight editions starting from 2007. Russia's Yelena Soboleva became the second athlete to be stripped of a 1500 m medal after she was banned for her involvement in a doping test manipulation scheme, alongside 2007 finalist Yuliya Fomenko and two-time world champion Tatyana Tomashova (who did not compete in 2007 and whose gold medals from 2003 and 2005 still stand). In 2009 Mariem Alaoui Selsouli withdrew from the final after a sample given earlier that year tested positive for EPO while heats runner Alemitu Bekele Degfa was banned due to biological passport abnormalities. Ukrainian duo Anzhelika Shevchenko and Nataliya Tobias had their 2011 results annulled while Olesya Syreva became the third Russian 1500 m to be disqualified for doping.\nBernard Lagat, the men's gold medallist in 2007, had a positive \"A\" sample test for EPO prior to the 2003 World Championships which was disregarded after the \"B\" sample (taken at the same time) returned a negative result. He was temporarily banned in the interim period of testing and missed the world championships as a result, having been runner-up two years earlier. Lagat and medical advisor Hans Heid were critical of the testing procedure for EPO and advocated the dropping of the technique until more reliable methods were found.\nOutside of the competition, the 2005 men's champion Rashid Ramzi was banned for doping after winning at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Inaugural women's champion Mary Decker was banned for doping later in her career, as were 2003 and 2005 runners-up Süreyya Ayhan and Olga Yegorova."

        "text": "The Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited cricket team, formerly known as Agriculture Development Bank of Pakistan cricket team, was a first-class cricket side in Pakistan. It was sponsored by the Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited. In May 2019, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan revamped the domestic cricket structure in Pakistan, excluding departmental teams like Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited in favour of regional sides. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was criticised in removing departmental sides, with players voicing their concern to revive the teams.\nPlaying history.\nAs the Agriculture Development Bank of Pakistan they played 148 first-class matches from 1985–86 to 2001–02, with 45 wins, 26 losses and 77 draws. When the bank changed its name and structure in 2002, the team also changed its name, beginning with the 2002–03 season, to Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited. Under the name Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited, they played 267 matches, with 86 wins, 68 losses and 113 draws.\nIn April 2018, they won the Patron's Trophy Grade-II tournament to qualify for the 2018–19 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. They won their opening match of the tournament, against Lahore Blues, by 151 runs. However, they finished bottom in their group, and were relegated back to the second-tier for the next season. They also finished bottom of their group in the 2018–19 Quaid-e-Azam One Day Cup, winning just one of their seven games."

For the regular season the teams were divided into two groups of seven teams and competed in a round-robin competition system, with team facing each of their opponents twice. The teams qualified for the eighth-finals based on their ranking after the regular season. Out of the five teams who participated in FIBA Europe Cup competition – Ventspils, Juventus, Šiauliai, TÜ/Rock and Pieno žvaigždės – the latter three didn't qualify for the FIBA Europe Cup playoffs and thus begin their journey at the start of the BBL play-offs, seeded respectively first, second and third based on last season’s results. All play-off games were played in home-and-away series.\nTartu Ülikool/Rock became the first Estonian team to reach the Baltic League finals. In the Finals they lost with an aggregate score of 157–176 to Lithuanian team Šiauliai who won their third title in a row. Third place belonged to Lithuanian side Lietkabelis who beat Latvian team Valmiera/ORDO with aggregate score of 160–154.\nAwards.\nMVP of the Month.\n! align=\"center\"|Month\n! align=\"center\" width=200|Player\n! align=\"center\" width=200|Team\n! align=\"center\" width=|Ref."

        "text": "The James Madison Dukes women's basketball team is the basketball team that represents James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States. The school's team currently competes in the Sun Belt Conference after previously playing in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). The Dukes are led by fifth-year head coach Sean O'Regan.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament thirteen times, most recently in 2023. Including Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) berths, the Dukes have played in a post-season tournament each season since 2006.\nHistory.\nJames Madison's women's basketball program is among the oldest in the nation, being founded in 1920. The program's first coach, Althea Loose Johnston, coached the team to a 106-33-5 record during her 22 year career. Through the end of the 2022–23 season, the Dukes have compiled a record of 1200-585 (.672), the fourth most wins among all Division I programs and only one of four with over 1,200 wins.\nIn the 1986 and 1991 NCAA women's tournaments, they upset the #1 seed (Virginia in the former and Penn State in the latter) while ranked #8 (the lowest seed at the time), being the first team to ever do that on the women's side (the size of the tournament for the former was 40 while the latter had 48 teams). They are one of only three schools to upset a #1 seed while ranked as the lowest seed (the other being Southwest Missouri State in 1992 and Harvard in 1998). They have made the NCAA Tournament in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1996, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2023. They have made the WNIT in 2001, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019, finishing as runner-up in 2012.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division I.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament twelve times. Their overall record in tournament games is 8–12.\nWNIT.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) nine times. They have an overall tournament record of 22-9. In the 2012 tournament, the Dukes finished as runners-up to Oklahoma State.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Dukes, then the Madison College Dukes, made one appearance in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 0–2.

The tour was a companion to the 2015–16 World Rugby Sevens Series for men.\nThe series was won by who won three tour events on their way to claiming their first World Series title. The previous women's champions finished in second place ahead of and .\nThe competition.\nThere were five tournament events in 2015–16. Twelve teams competed at each event; eleven being \"core\" teams, with a twelfth team invited to participate in particular events (similar to previous women's series as well as the men's counterpart). The overall winner of the series was determined by points gained from the standings across the five events.\nFor the second time, the women's series held a core team qualifying tournament, similar to that held in the men's HSBC Sevens World Series. The qualifying event was held at University College Dublin, in Ireland, and resulted in Japan and the hosts Ireland qualifying as core teams for the main 2015-16 tournament.\nTeams.\nEleven \"core teams\" participated in all series events for the 2015–16 series, the same number as the previous season. The top nine finishers in the 2014–15 series were granted core team status for 2014–15:\nTwo additional core teams were determined in a qualifying tournament:\nQualifying tournament.\nThe core team qualifying tournament was held at the UCD Bowl on 22–23 August 2015.\nThe qualifier began with a single round-robin pool stage, with teams divided into three four-team pools. The top two teams from each pool, plus the top two third-place finishers, advanced to a knockout stage. The two finalists (the semifinal winners) qualified as core teams for 2015–16.\nPoints schedule.\nThe season championship is determined by points earned in each tournament. The scoring system is the same used in the previous year's series.\nIn the event of a tournament being abandoned, no series points are allocated.\nIf two or more teams are level on series points at the end of the season, the following tiebreakers are used to determine placement:\nTable.\nFinal standings for the 2015–16 series:"

        "title": "Cycling at the 2016 Summer Paralympics",
        "text": "Cycling at the 2016 Summer Paralympics consisted of 50 events in two main disciplines, track cycling and road cycling. The venues were the Rio Olympic Velodrome for track cycling in the Barra Cluster, and the Flamengo Park for the road cycling disciplines in the Copacapana Cluster. Seventeen events were contested on the track, and 33 on the road.\nClassification.\nCyclists are given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability. This method is known as a functional system and was introduced in 2012. Athletes are classified according to their functional ability across four broad categories (blind or partially sighted tandem, handcycle, tricycle and standard bicycle). The class number indicates the severity of impairment with \"1\" being most impaired. The classification system allows cyclists to compete against others with a similar level of function.\nRiders with recovering or deteriorating conditions such as MS are eligible but must have been reclassified within six months of a World Championships or Paralympic Games to ensure their classification is correct. Specialised equipment including prostheses is only allowed where it has been specifically approved.\nThis class is for athletes who have visual impairments and therefore ride tandem bicycles with a guide (known as a pilot). They may have any level of visual impairment from no light perception in either eye through to a visual acuity of 6/60 and/or a visual field of less than 20 degrees.\nThis class is for athletes who are lower limb amputees, have paraplegia or tetraplegia and ride a handcycle using arms to turn pedals for propulsion. H1–4 cyclists compete in a lying position, whereas H5 cyclists compete in a kneeling position.\nThis class is for athletes who have a neurological condition or an impairment which has a comparable effect on their cycling so that they are not able to compete on a standard bicycle for reasons of balance.\nThis class is for athletes with moderate locomotion impairment who do not require a tricycle. In many cases a modification will be allowed to accommodate a leg or arm prosthesis.\nFactored events.\nSome cycling events, 16 in total across track and road, are factored. This can happen when cyclists from different classes compete against each other and means that the results take into account the severity of the impairments of each competitor. As a result, some riders within an event will have their times ‘factored’ while other riders will not, or will have their time factored in a different calculation. The gold medal goes to the athlete with the fastest time after all the required times have been calculated. It is therefore possible for an athlete to break a paralympic or world record in their event for their specific classification, but to finish behind a differently classified athlete in that event after factoring. In such a case, the record is still treated as an official World, or as the case may be, Paralympic Games record within their classification for that event.\nFactoring should not be confused with certain events where athletes with a greater impairment are entitled to compete in a race for athletes with a 'lesser' impairment, for example double amputees (such as Oscar Pistorius) in a single leg amputee athletics race alongside runners such as Jonnie Peacock or Richard Browne. In such races, no factoring is taken into account. In cycling, a number of the road races are cross-classification and non-factored despite factoring taking place in the time trial for the same classifications.\nEvents.\nEvents in each classification, including factored events in joined classifications are set out below.\nParticipating nations.\n235 cyclists from 45 nations competed.\nMedal summary.\nAs at the Olympic Games, Great Britain had a clear lead in the medal table based on dominance within the velodrome, particularly in the female events where Kadeena Cox became the first British paralympian in 32 years to win golds in two different sports at the same Games, and Sarah Storey confirmed herself as the most successful female paralympian from Great Britain, overtaking the record set by fellow peer Tanni Grey-Thompson.\nOn the road, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy were dominant, with racing driver turned handcyclist Alex Zanardi winning two gold medals and a silver to add to an identical haul from London in 2012. The United States, Australia and China also won more than ten medals each across the 50 events.\nMedal table.\n Host nation (Brazil)"

Of those 22 founding clubs, 9 were from Lancashire.\nThe first Lancashire winners of the newly formed league, the NRFU Championship were Oldham, with Wigan being the most successful with 22 titles. Between 1896 and 1900 teams either played in the Lancashire or Yorkshire League depending on geographical location but still competed in the Challenge Cup. Wigan are the most successful club in the competition with 19 titles.\nIn the Super League era St Helens R.F.C. are the most successful Lancashire club, and second most of all (behind Leeds Rhinos), with seven Super League titles.\nCompetitions.\nLancashire League.\nThe Lancashire League was founded in 1895 for teams in Lancashire to compete in. Wigan and St Helens dominated the league before it was abandoned in 1970 due to the amount of fixtures being played.\nLancashire Cup.\nThe Lancashire Cup was a cup competition for teams in Lancashire. The competition ran from 1905-1992 when it folded due to the amount of fixtures in the calendar and the Rugby Football League (RFL) not seeing it as being a part of the future of modern rugby league.\nRugby league clubs in Lancashire.\nThe table below lists clubs located within the traditional borders of Lancashire: from the top division (the Super League), down to tier 3 of the British rugby league system.\nLocations.\nGreater Manchester.\nGreater Manchester has the strongest concentration of rugby league teams within the traditional boundaries of Lancashire. The most notable team is Wigan Warriors.\nCheshire.\nCheshire had its own rugby league tradition with Runcorn being one of the founder members of the Northern Union in 1895 but this died out. Boundary changes to England's counties in the 1970s brought the formerly Lancastrian towns of Widnes and Warrington into Cheshire.\nMerseyside.\nMerseyside was a county formed in 1974 from parts of Lancashire and Cheshire. Currently St. Helens are the only professional side within Merseyside, but other sides have also existed, notably Liverpool Stanley and Prescott Panthers.\nCumbria.\nCumbria is a county that was created in the 1970s composing of the former counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire. Barrow Raiders are the oldest side in what is now Cumbria and are based in what was part of Lancashire. Other Cumbrian sides exist and have existed in the traditional county of Cumberland, namely Whitehaven, Workington Town and at one time Carlisle. These sides played in the Lancashire cup despite playing outside the boundaries of traditional Lancashire.\nLancashire.\nWithin the current borders of Lancashire there are currently no professional rugby league sides. The most recent side to play is Blackpool Panthers which folded in 2010."

It is one of the home grounds of the Central Districts cricket team and the Hawke's Bay Rugby Union. It has hosted international cricket matches since 1979, the first Test match at the ground taking place between New Zealand and Pakistan in February of that year.

        "text": "Nigel Gilbert (born 20 March 1959) is an English former professional snooker player, famous for wearing a glove on his bridging hand while playing.\nCareer.\nGilbert turned professional in 1986 at the age of 27, and made his first appearance in the latter stages of a tournament at the 1987 International Open. There, he defeated Ian Black 5–3, Jack McLaughlin 5–4, Murdo MacLeod 5–1 and Wayne Jones 5–4, before losing 0–5 to veteran Australian Eddie Charlton in the last 16.\nThe following year, Gilbert reached the quarter-final of the 1988 Grand Prix, where he beat Bill Oliver 5–4, Silvino Francisco 5–4, Eddie Charlton 5–0 in a reverse of the previous year's encounter, and Tony Knowles 5–4 before losing 4–5 to Alain Robidoux.\nHis best performance at the World Championship came in 1990, where he lost in the last 32 to Terry Griffiths 4–10, having at one point led Griffiths 3–2.\nDespite poor form in the first half of the 1990s, Gilbert reached a career-high ranking of 44th in 1994; he retained this position for a year, but having not reached the last 16 of a ranking event since the 1991 Dubai Classic, he slipped to 111th at the end of the 1996–97 season and was relegated from the tour. He won back his place after one season, but was unable to rise higher than 119th, and lost his professional status for the final time in 2001, aged 42."

A first five-eighth, Black represented Otago and Buller at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, selected for the All Blacks, on their 1914 tour of Australia whilst representing the Otago province.\nHe played in six of the matches on tour including the first test and scored three tries. Working as a clerk in the Bank of New South Wales, Black was posted, on his return from Sydney, to Westport where he played two games for Buller in September. He was back in Dunedin in 1915 but Pirates did not field a team in the senior championship so he transferred to the University of Otago club and played twice for Otago.\nBlack enlisted in the Otago Mounted Rifles in November 1915 and, after transferring to the Canterbury Regiment, saw active service in the Battle of the Somme. He was killed in action on 21 September 1916, and he was memorialised on the Caterpillar Valley (New Zealand) Memorial, which commemorates over 1200 New Zealand soldiers who died in the Battles of the Somme in 1916 for whom there is no known grave, although his body was subsequently identified and buried."

        "text": "The 2006 Big League World Series took place from July 29-August 5 in Easley, South Carolina, United States. Thousand Oaks, California defeated San Juan, Puerto Rico in the championship game. It is also known for the infamous \"Goose-Stampede\". \nThe Goose Stampede.\nThe 2006 Big League World Series Goose Stampede was an unusual and memorable incident that occurred during the 2006 Big League Baseball World Series, an international youth baseball tournament held annually in Easley, South Carolina. The event took place on August 4th, 2006, during a game between two competing teams, and it quickly gained widespread attention due to its unexpected and comical nature.\nBackground.\nThe Big League World Series is an annual baseball tournament organized by Little League International, featuring top-level teams of teenage players from around the world. The 2006 edition of the tournament featured teams from the United States, Asia, Latin America, Canada, and other regions, all competing for the title of world champion. The event attracted a large audience and showcased the talent and dedication of young athletes on an international stage.\nThe Incident.\nOn August 4th, 2006, during a pivotal game of the tournament, a bizarre and unexpected event unfolded that temporarily delayed the baseball action. As the two teams battled on the field, a large flock of geese suddenly descended upon the baseball field. These geese, numbering in the hundreds, caused an unexpected and comical interruption to the game.\nThe geese stampede was not a typical occurrence in the world of sports, and the players, coaches, and spectators were taken by surprise. The feathered intruders wandered onto the field, seemingly oblivious to the ongoing baseball game. Their presence caused laughter and amazement among those in attendance, as well as bewilderment among the players and officials.\nEfforts were made to shoo the geese away and resume the game as quickly as possible. Various methods, including waving flags and using loud noises, were attempted to persuade the geese to vacate the field. However, these efforts proved to be largely unsuccessful, as the geese seemed uninterested in leaving. One member of the crowd in particular, Matthew Bain, was seen to be running towards the geese shouting 'Hjonk' attempting to recreate their mating call; some questioned whether this was in an attempt to attract the geese, but this was never proven. Bain, not being a local resident, was quickly chased out of the stadium by local residents. He has since not returned to the country, and has been exiled to Australia where he now lives in solitude.\nAs a result, the game was temporarily halted, and a humorous spectacle ensued. Spectators and players watched as the geese waddled across the field, occasionally flapping their wings and honking. Some players even attempted to gently herd the geese away from the diamond, but the waterfowl were largely uncooperative. The delay continued for several minutes, with the geese providing unexpected entertainment to the crowd.\nResolution.\nAfter several minutes of bemusement and laughter, the geese eventually made their way off the field and continued their journey elsewhere. With the intruders finally departing, the game was able to resume, and the baseball action continued as if nothing had happened.\nDespite the unexpected interruption, the game proceeded, and the 2006 Big League World Series continued as planned. The event remains a memorable and light-hearted moment in the tournament's history, often recounted with amusement by those who were present to witness the goose stampede.\nLegacy.\nThe 2006 Big League World Series Goose Stampede has become a notable and cherished part of the tournament's history, adding a touch of whimsy to an otherwise serious and competitive event. It serves as a reminder that unexpected and humorous moments can occur in even the most competitive and prestigious sporting events.\nThis incident has also gained recognition on social media platforms, with videos and images of the goose stampede circulating online, bringing smiles to a wider audience beyond those who were in attendance. It stands as a reminder that sometimes, even in the world of sports, nature can provide moments of levity and entertainment.\nIn the end, the 2006 Big League World Series Goose Stampede is celebrated as a unique and amusing episode that added an unexpected twist to the world of youth baseball\nResults.\nGroup A\nGroup B\nElimination Round"

        "text": "The city of Durban, South Africa was initially elected as the host for the 2022 Commonwealth Games on 2 September 2015, at a General Assembly in Auckland, New Zealand. It was reported in February 2017 however, Durban may be unable to host the games due to financial constraints. On 13 March 2017, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) stripped Durban of their rights to host. On 21 December 2017, Birmingham was awarded for the 2022 Games as Durban's replacement host. Louise Martin, president of the Commonwealth Games Federation, made the official announcement at a press conference at the Arena Academy in Birmingham.\nBids for the 1st election.\nOfficial bids.\nTwo cities made confirmed bids for the games; Durban, South Africa and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Edmonton withdrew its bid in February 2015, leaving Durban as the only bid to go forward to CGF General Assembly in September 2015.\nProposed bids which did not go to application.\nThe following cities proposed bidding; however, they did not bid or even formally announce their intentions to bid.\nInitial concerns over lack of hosting interest.\nOn 22 January 2014, The BBC reported that the organisers of the Commonwealth Games were concerned about the future of the event, after no member country had expressed serious interest in hosting the 2022 edition with only two months to go before the March 2014 deadline for applicant cities. The high cost of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, with reports of between £500 million and £1 billion, damage to the reputation of the competition following the 2010 Games and disputes between the Commonwealth Games Federation board and member states' sporting federations were all said to be factors in why no serious hosting intentions were being made. Cardiff, who were pursuing a bid for the 2026 games, said it would be \"unlikely\" for them to bring their bid forward to 2022. An emergency general meeting was held in Kuala Lumpur on 24 January to try and resolve these issues and ensure the future of the games.\nOn 31 January 2014 Gideon Sam, vice-president of the Commonwealth Games Federation, was quoted in \"The Namibian\" stating intentions of holding the 2022 games in Africa following meetings in Kuala Lumpur: \"We decided that 2022 will be Africa’s time. Africa makes up a huge number of Commonwealth countries and we now appeal to African leaders to be brave, to club together and to come forward so that we can host the Commonwealth Games\" \"We cannot continue doing what we did in the past, when we voted with Asia, Oceania or the Americas and not for ourselves. The time has come to show the world that there are no lions roaming the streets or naked people walking around\""

        "title": "2026 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "The 2026 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XXIII Commonwealth Games, is a planned multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth of Nations. The 2026 Commonwealth Games would be the first to be held since the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the accession of King Charles III as Head of the Commonwealth on 8 September 2022.\nThe games are currently without a host. The Australian state of Victoria was initially announced as the host in April 2022, after two months of an exclusive dialogue process with the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). However, on 18 July 2023 the Victorian state government announced it had cancelled its plans to host the games, citing an escalation in its cost projections relative to initial estimations. The city of Gold Coast offered to co-host the games with Victoria, but later withdrew their offer for the same reason. If no replacement is found, there is a possibility that the games may be postponed to 2027 or cancelled.\nIf cancellation occurs, it would be the first time that the Commonwealth Games had been cancelled since the 1942 and 1946 games were cancelled due to World War II.\nHost selection.\nFirst selection.\nDuring the CGF General Assembly on 31 March 2017 in Gold Coast, after the troubled 2022 Commonwealth Games host city bid process, the executive board announced that it had planned to award both 2026 and 2030 Commonwealth Games simultaneously at the CGF General Assembly scheduled for Kigali, Rwanda in September 2019. A new model called CGF Partnerships (CGFP) was implemented which aimed to give stronger support to the associations and cities that show interests in hosting future Games, and enhance the overall value of the event. This is similar to the process used by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) since 2017.\nIn 2015 the South African city of Durban originally won the rights to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, but was stripped of this right in 2017 due to financial concerns. As a result, Birmingham moved up its planned Games from 2026 to 2022. This left the 2026 Games without a host and bids from Kuala Lumpur, Cardiff, Calgary, Edmonton and Adelaide were all withdrawn due to concerns over costs, with a hosting decision not made by the Commonwealth Games Federation between 2019 and 2022.\nIn January 2022 the Victorian State Government announced it was giving serious consideration to a late request from the CGF to host the Games. On 16 February 2022, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews confirmed that the state was in exclusive negotiations with the CGF to host the Games. It was stated that if successful in hosting the Games a second time, a Victorian bid would aim to emphasise the state's regional centres—such as Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo—as opposed to being predominantly Melbourne-based, such as in 2006. Bendigo had previously hosted the 2004 Commonwealth Youth Games. Acceptance of the bid would likely also be conditional upon agreement on ways to control costs, such as housing athletes and officials in hotels rather than a dedicated village. This bid was confirmed as successful on 12 April 2022.\nOn 18 July 2023, Andrews and Deputy Premier Jacinta Allan announced the state government intended to cancel the 2026 Victorian Games. Fifteen months after agreeing to host the Games, the Premier said the cost had escalated to an estimated 6–7 billion, double the estimated economic benefits for the state, and the government could not justify the expense. The state said it would terminate its host agreement with the Commonwealth Games Federation and seek a settlement of the contract. The withdrawal prompted a new search for a host for the 2026 Games.\nSecond selection.\nThe Mayor of London Sadiq Khan subsequently said he was \"ready\" to support the London bid to replace Victoria as the host. Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf has also stated that he is \"willing to consider proposals\" for Scotland to host at least some of the events at the Games.\nOn 4 December 2023, the Gold Coast ruled itself out of hosting the games. On the same day, the British government confirmed that there would be \"no UK rescue\" for the games and that they would not be hosted in the United Kingdom, citing that there is no financial appetite or any preliminary planning in place to allow another British city to intervene again after Birmingham 2022.\nMalaysia.\nOn 11 March 2024, the Olympic Council of Malaysia announced that the CGF offered Malaysia around £100 million for the country to take on the responsibility of hosting the event on a smaller scale than originally planned, and that talks were ongoing. On 22 March 2024, the Cabinet of Malaysia declined the invitation, citing that the £100 million offer would not be enough to cover the cost for the games. Additionally, the Federal Government of Malaysia would not want to use taxpayers money to fund the games, as well as the potential of these games, if delayed to 2027, to clash with the 2027 SEA Games, which are also scheduled to be held in Malaysia.\nSingapore.\nOn 14 March 2024, Commonwealth Games Singapore (CGS), the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and Sport Singapore (SportSG) \nannounced that they were assessing the feasibility of hosting the games after it was invited by the CGF to do so. A joint hosting with Malaysia was also considered to reduce costs. Subsequently, on 3 April 2024, CGS and SportSG announced that they would not make any bid to host the games.\nGhana.\nOn 8 April 2024, the Commonwealth Games Federation announced that a new host for the 2026 Games was likely to be announced the following month, and the next day, the Ghana Minister for Youth and Sports Mustapha Ussif confirmed the country's interest in hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games after the capital, Accra, successfully hosted the 2023 African Games in March 2024.\nScotland.\nOn 11 April 2024, it was announced that Glasgow was being considered as a \"last resort\" to host the 2026 Games in the event no other host was forthcoming, to safeguard the Games themselves. It was reported that the Games would reuse venues from the 2014 Commonwealth Games and use existing accommodation for athletes. Furthermore, the costs of the Games would be covered fully by the Commonwealth Games Federation and other corporate sponsors. Discussions were on-going between Commonwealth Games Scotland, the Scottish Government, and EventScotland with a confirmed bid expected by the end of the month, but both the Chair of Commonwealth Games Scotland Paul Bush and Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf had previously expressed support for Scotland hosting."

        "title": "Cycling in Kuala Lumpur",
        "text": "Cycling in Kuala Lumpur () refers to the bicycle uses in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for touring, recreational, work and transportation purpose. It was first appeared on 1938 when there is a first road cycling race that has been introduced in Kuala Lumpur. The introduction of the bicycle in Kuala Lumpur was later become one of the preferred transportation methods for students and mid-class citizens. As Kuala Lumpur begin its rapid urbanization progress since 1960s, the usage of bicycle start to decline as people shifting their transportation method to driving. In recent years however, the roads of the city have seen an increased presence of cyclists, whereas the importance of doing exercise has become more recognized. To match this positive change, and to reduce air pollution, the city urgently needs the introduction of more pavements and bicycle lanes, ideally by leveraging on the vast area that is currently taken up by motorways. Given that Kuala Lumpur lacks many bicycle-friendly routes suitable for cyclists in the city, however, proposals of a bicycle infrastructure of urban bicycling program were drafted, mainly under the Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 and cycling activism by Cycling Kuala Lumpur in order to encourage more citizens of Kuala Lumpur to cycle in the urban area.\nBackground.\nThe history of cycling in Kuala Lumpur dates back to 1938 when there were a few road racing events which were held in the city and became one of the main transportation methods for mid-class citizens during the 1980s. The first bicycle route in Malaysia is Wangsa Maju bike route which is located in the residential area of Wangsa Maju, which costs US$ 320,000 to build, officially opened in 1997 to public while at the same time the mayor of Kuala Lumpur, Tan Sri Dato’ Kamaruzzaman Shariff announced that another US$1.6 million will be allocated for future bike route by encouraging developers of real estate to include bike routes in their residential area. Despite its effort to encourage people to cycle in Kuala Lumpur, many people still prefer to choose driving as their main mode of commuting to Kuala Lumpur at that time due to the urbanization of Kuala Lumpur since 1960s and introduction of automotive industry in Malaysia, particularly the debut of PROTON in 1983.\nHowever, in 2012, Jeffrey Lim, the leader of the cycling activism for Cycling Kuala Lumpur, had an idea of creating a Kuala Lumpur map which is specialized for cyclists to cycle in the city using the possible and suitable routes. The development of the map involving more than 50 volunteers who seeking for suitable routes for cyclist to ride bicycle, which will then marked to the blank map that are given by Lim. During the development of the map, the city still lacks many facilities for cyclists to cycle around the city such as bike routes, segregated bike routes and bicycle parking. The first version of the map was completed in September 2014 and distributed through participating bicycle shops for free and released in English, Malay and Chinese language. This mapping program has attracted the mayor of Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL), Ahmad Phesal Talib, who has cycling as one of his interests, to participate in the introduction and improvements of an urban cycling program.\nIn 2013, Ahmad Phesal Talib announces that the city council has planned to upgrade the cycling infrastructures in Kuala Lumpur to promote healthy lifestyle among peoples in urban zone. This proposal was announced during the Earth Hour session at Kuala Lumpur in 2013. While the construction of the infrastructure must be located in the populated area, its infrastructure must also be connected with the nearby rapid transit system in the city such as RapidKL Rail. In addition to the improvements to the infrastructure, the city hall also announces the construction of the 10 km bicycle highway which is known as Southwest Dedicated Bicycle Highway, which connects from Merdeka Square to Mid Valley Megamall. The 5.5 km Southwest Dedicated Bicycle Highway which costs RM 700,000 to construct, officially opened in April 2015.\nSince 2017 less and less of the bicycle track is accessible due to construction works.\nAim.\nThe aim for the bicycling movement in Kuala Lumpur is to promote travelling in Kuala Lumpur in an alternative way that are healthy, cheaper and reduce traffic congestion and pollution while cultivating the culture of cycling among Malaysian people, to par with existing cycling cultures in Copenhagen and in Stockholm. In addition to the tourism, lifestyle and bicycle culture, the bicycle movement also aims to make Kuala Lumpur as a preferred international cycling destination to attract cyclists from Asian region to cycle in this region.\nBicycle infrastructure.\nBike route.\nCurrently, only few dedicated bicycle routes exist in Kuala Lumpur. These are:\nOther routes for the upcoming bicycle highway / bicycle-friendly routes are confirmed in the blueprint are:\nIn addition to these blueprints, additional facilities will also be installed together with the existing bike route such as Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV), solar panel and revitalization of the landscape surrounding the bike route. Furthermore, additional 4m of the space under elevated railway and monorail has been reserved for bike route purpose. Due to some of the motorists start parking at bike route illegally since the opening of the Southwest Dedicated Bicycle Highway, actions has been taken by the authorities to ensure that no motorists can park their car on the bike route by educating the motorists about rules of the bike route in addition to tow away the car that are parked on the bike lane.\nThere are also some bike routes inside the park and hill area for recreational such as Bukit Kiara and FRIM which is popular for road cycling and mountain biking.\nParking.\nIn most of the bus station and rapid transit station, bicycle parking facilities such as parking rack are provided for cyclists who are not able to carry the bicycle to the bus and train other than foldable bikes. However, due to lack of awareness by commuters who know about the existence of parking facilities provided inside the building, some cyclists choose to park their bicycle near the objects where the cyclists are able to lock their bicycle such as water pipes if they think their bicycle are not very expensive.\nNow, over 42 station in Ampang/Sri Petaling Line and Kelana Jaya Line have “Bike N' Ride” service.\nTransporting bicycles.\nBicycle can now be allowed to carry inside the bus and rapid transit. However, there are some restrictions applies regarding carrying the bike to rapid transit. Only foldable bikes are allowed to carry to the bus and rapid transit due to the size of bicycle that are easy to carry than other types of regular bikes and bikes are also prohibited to carry during peak hour. The maximum people in a cycling group to carry and ride inside the public transportation vary by types of lines and transportation methods. In Ampang Line, maximum five cyclists are allowed to on board, while on Kelana Jaya Line maximum two cyclists are allowed to on-board and only one cyclist is allowed to on board in bus.\nBicycling events.\nIn addition to the improvement of the infrastructure, there are notable bicycling events which are held annually or monthly in Kuala Lumpur.\nPopularity and influences.\nAlthough cycling was used to be the norm transportation methods for mid-class citizen, this however the popularity of cycling has gained momentum from various class of people in Kuala Lumpur due to the usual traffic congestion that often occurs in the city in addition to the increasing price of petroleum, while at the same time people agree that cycling can help them to explore additional places while exercising and easily meet people around. The rising of the bicycling popularity has also benefited the bicycle shop business in Kuala Lumpur that once not being profitable in the past, but however being profitable for now due to the changes of their lifestyle.\nThe recent opening of the cycling cafe and bicycle-themed coffeehouse is also said to be influenced from bicycle culture in other countries where cyclists gathering at cafe for meetup and planning for next ride while at the same time it is designated for cycling community which is currently emerging. It is also one of the preferred transportation methods for students to go to school from home. Foldable bikes has become one of the popular bikes among the cycling community and its transportation methods in Kuala Lumpur due to its portability, environmental friendly transportation and ability to carry the bicycle to the rapid transit system, with its sales of the foldable bikes roses to 35% between 2010 and 2011. \nBrompton is among the most preferred foldable bike brands widely chosen by the customers than any other brands. The growth of the cycling in the region also creates another job opportunity in Kuala Lumpur with the introduction of bike messenger in 2015, which is known as Vélo Express KL, where they responsible for delivering the items through bicycles in the urban area. The team’s aim is to give awareness that cycling can also be used as an alternative transportation to driving or public transportation despite still have lack of bicycle facilities, where one of the member claims that the statement of cycling in Kuala Lumpur is dangerous is false. \nAlthough bike messengers are still new to the city when compared to Indonesia where it already exists, it has already received many delivery requests from employees at office who do not plan to temporary leave the working place during the usual working hours. However, despite the growth of bicycle culture in the area, some of the building management still refused to allow bicycles to enter their building as the security guard looked on bicycles and cyclists around building as suspicious due to the no bicycle policy that is still implemented in some buildings today."

NPC can enter a further two female athletes in women's compound W1 or compound open as world individual or mixed team champion in that event, so a theoretical maximum of fifteen archers is possible across the nine events.\nNPCs that qualify at least a single individual man and woman in a specific discipline – compound W1, compound open or recurve open – are able to enter a two-member mixed team to the relevant team event, while also having each member compete in the individual event. If an NPC qualifies multiple archers in each gender in a specific discipline, however, they remain restricted to a single team in the mixed team event in that discipline.\nSix places are reserved for Brazil as the host nation, one in each individual event, and as a consequence, Brazil will enter a team in each of the Mixed Pairs events. A further eleven will be decided by the Bipartite Commission. The remaining 123 places are then allocated through a qualification process, in which archers earned quota places for their respective NPCs, though not necessarily for themselves.\nTo be eligible to participate in the Paralympic Games after the NPC has obtained a quota place, all archers must be classified with a confirmed or review sports status, to ensure Paralympic eligibility, and have achieved a minimum qualification score (MQS):\nThe MQS must have been achieved between 1 July 2015 and 1 July 2016.\nQualification details.\nPlaces are awarded to the NPC, not the individual athlete. Where an athlete's name appears, the athlete's NPC has selected that athlete to take this place in Rio; this athlete may or may not have gained the qualification.\nMixed team events.\nThere is no direct qualification for the mixed pairs events, and an NPC may enter one team (1 man, 1 woman) per event if they have qualified those archers from individual events. However, since Rio 2016 quota places in individual events were awarded to the top finishers in the equivalent mixed pairs event at the 2015 World Para Archery Championships in Donau, Germany, a minimum number of teams per event is guaranteed.\nOn 5 September 2016, the IPC published the full entry lists for all mixed team events in archery.

Both cities are only separated by 66 km.\nHistory.\nFirst games.\nSince the dissolution of Cajabilbao in 1994, Baskonia was the only Basque team in the Liga ACB until Bilbao Basket, founded in 2003, achieved promotion to the Spanish top league in 2004.\nThe first match between both teams was played on 3 October 2004, in the first round of the 2004–05 ACB season, at Pabellón La Casilla. Baskonia won by a huge 57–104, the biggest loss ever received by Bilbao Basket. After a second defeat, Bilbao won its first derby on 22 January 2006, by 92–78.\nOn 6 January 2007, Bizkaia Arena registered the highest attendance to date for a Liga ACB game with 15,414 people in the 78–92 win by Baskonia.\nRise of the rivalry and cup games.\nAs Bilbao Basket started to improve its level, the rivalry between both teams increased. On 29 September 2007, Baskonia won the Supercopa by defeating Bilbao at Bizkaia Arena by 73–85. One year later, both teams played the first derby in the 2008 Copa del Rey semifinal and Baskonia won again by a narrow 68–66.\nFirst playoffs.\nIn the 2009 ACB Playoffs both teams met in the quarterfinals. Baskonia the series by 2–0 and would repeat this result again in the 2012 edition.\nDerbies at EuroLeague.\nBilbao Basket qualified for the first time to the EuroLeague on 2011, after finishing as runner-up of the 2010–11 ACB season. As Spain had five teams in the competition, both teams were drawn in the same group. Bilbao Basket won both games and eliminated Baskonia in the game played at Bilbao Arena, where the \"Men in black\" won by 77–72. This was the first time Baskonia did not qualify for the Top16 in the modern era of the Euroleague. Bilbao advanced in the competition until the quarterfinals, where they were eliminated by CSKA Moscow.\nBrawl at Bilbao Arena and decline of Bilbao Basket.\nOn March 1, 2015, the derby finished with a brawl where Dejan Todorović of Bilbao and Tornike Shengelia of Baskonia were disqualified and twelve players were ejected due to court invasion during the fight.\nWith four seconds left and Bilbao winning by a huge margin, despite the referee's call for a travelling, Todorović was going to dunk when he was hit by Shengelia. After this, the Serbian player pushed Shengelia from behind and the Georgian forward reacted with a punch. After this, all the players who were in the bench came into the court and started the brawl. When Shengelia was leaving the court after the disqualifying foul, he apologized to a child who was in the first row of the arena.\nThe ACB announced this brawl would have severe consequences and sanctions and would talk with the Spanish Basketball Federation for changing the disciplinary regulations. On March 5, the league provisionally suspended Todorović and Shengelia until the final resolution of the case.\nBoth clubs claimed to have the same sanctions than in 2004, when the brawl Real Madrid and Estudiantes occurred. Finally, on March 11, the Disciplinary Judge accorded to suspend Tornike Shengelia for five games, Dejan Todorović for four and a €3,000 fine to Bilbao Basket player Dairis Bertāns and to Baskonia brothers Mamadou and Ilimane Diop.\nOn 13 May 2018, Baskonia won a derby at Bilbao Arena by 78–74, thus relegating Bilbao Basket to the LEB Oro after 14 consecutive years in the top league. Bilbao returned to Liga ACB at the first opportunity, earning immediate promotion with a second-place finish in the 2018–19 LEB Oro season."

It was the second season in charge for head coach Jimmy Adams. The club captain was England spinner James Tredwell, taking over from Rob Key who had been club captain since 2006. Brendan Nash registered as a Kolpak player, ending his West Indies international career, which allowed Kent to sign another overseas player. South African fast bowler Vernon Philander filled this role, although he was only with the club for a short spell in July. Another new addition to the squad was 22-year-old Calum Haggett from Somerset. Shortly before the end of the season, Kent signed two young fast bowlers: Charlie Hartley and Matt Hunn (Matt Hunn made his debut in the final county championship match of 2013). In addition, Mitchell Claydon joined on loan from Durham on 11 June initially for one month, but this was extended for a second month (he later signed on a permanent basis for 2014).\nKent endured a difficult season, finishing seventh of nine in Division two of the County Championship (despite only losing twice; 11 of their 16 matches were drawn) and making little impact on the List A Yorkshire Bank 40 competition (won 6, lost 6) or the Friends Life t20 (won 3, lost 7).\n23-year-old all-rounder Matt Coles joined Hampshire on loan in August before signing a three-year contract with them in September. Batsman Mike Powell announced his retirement in September after two years with Kent (and previously 15 years with Glamorgan). Despite being Kent's leading wicket taker in the County Championship in 2013, Charlie Shreck was not offered a new contract and he later signed for Leicestershire.\nJames Tredwell received further international recognition for England, playing in all five One Day Internationals of the January 2013 tour of India, and a further 10 ODIs during the English summer - including the final of the 2013 Champions Trophy. Tredwell took a total of 25 wickets in these matches, taking his tally to 36 wickets in 24 ODIs.

He also played for New South Wales City.\nBackground.\nBorn on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Ross played his junior rugby league for the Burleigh Bears and Coogee Randwick Wombats.\nRoss is the son of former Penrith Panthers, South Sydney Rabbitohs and Gold Coast Seagulls player Mark Ross.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nIn 2009, Ross played for the Tweed Heads Seagulls in the Queensland Cup, before returning to the Burleigh Bears in 2010. In 2011, he moved to Newcastle, New South Wales for work, while playing for Lakes United in the Newcastle Rugby League. In 2012, he moved to France to play for Toulouse Olympique, before returning to Lakes United later that year. His form that year, scoring 11 tries in 8 games for Lakes United, was rewarded by getting games with the Newcastle Knights' New South Wales Cup side.\nIn 2013, he signed with the Western Suburbs Rosellas, before leaving without playing a match to do a pre-season with the Knights' first-grade squad. He was unsuccessful with getting a contract so signed with the Kurri Kurri Bulldogs for the 2013 season. As Kurri Kurri made their way to the 2013 Newcastle Rugby League Grand Final, he was considered \"arguably the most lethal player in the competition\".\nIn 2014, he joined the Knights' New South Wales Cup side again on a 1-year contract, as their full-time fullback. On 21 September 2014, he was named at fullback in the 2014 New South Wales Cup Team of the Year, after scoring 17 tries in 16 games that season. On 14 October 2014, he re-signed with the Knights on a 2-year contract, almost signing with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs before the Knights decided to offer him a contract.\n2015.\nOn 31 January and 1 February, Ross played for the Knights in the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines. On 27 April 2015, he was named as 19th man for the New South Wales Residents to play the Queensland Residents. In Round 21 of the 2015 NRL season, he made his NRL debut for the Knights against the St. George Illawarra Dragons, scoring a try on debut. He went on to play in the next remaining 5 games of the season for the Knights. Late in the year, he had his contract with the Knights upgraded for 2016, with an option for 2017.\n2016.\nOn 6 August, after playing in the majority of the Knights' games that season, Ross cancelled his optional contract for 2017 by re-signing with the Knights on a new 2-year contract until the end of 2018.\n2017.\nIn July, he had his Knights contract extended until the end of 2020.\nIn August he fractured his back playing against the New Zealand Warriors.\n2018.\nIn the 2018 season, Ross made 15 appearances and scored 2 tries as Newcastle avoided the wooden spoon for the first time in his career, but failed to reach the finals.\n2019.\nRoss retired from rugby league in April 2019 after suffering irreparable damage to his pelvis. He had also suffered from a persistent groin injury and a compound dislocation to his finger during pre-season, threatening to derail his season before it had started."

        "text": "Headingley Cricket Ground is a cricket ground in the Headingley Stadium complex in Headingley, Leeds, England. It adjoins the Headingley Rugby Stadium through a shared main stand, although the main entrance to the cricket ground is at the opposite Kirkstall Lane end. It has hosted Test cricket since 1899 and has a capacity of 18,350.\nHistory.\nA sports ground at Headingley was developed by a group of benefactors led by Lord Hawke who was instrumental in the establishment of Yorkshire County Cricket Club; initially the ground was intended to be used for six sports; cricket, rugby, football, tennis, bowls and cycling. The first recorded first class cricket match took place at Headingley in September 1890. Prior to 1890 Yorkshire played matches around the county with the initial headquarters being at Bramall Lane in Sheffield. Yorkshire continued to use Bramall Lane as a secondary ground until 1973. In 1903 Yorkshire moved their base to Headingley. The mainstand shared between cricket and rugby was destroyed by fire in 1932; this was promptly replaced by a structure which stood until being demolished in 2018. In 2005 the ground was acquired by Yorkshire County Cricket Club from Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company, the company established by Lord Hawke when the ground was first established. The first redevelopment of the ground undertaken under ownership of Yorkshire County Cricket Club was the development of the Carnegie Pavilion which was completed in 2010.\nNotable sporting moments.\nIn 1902, Yorkshire beat the touring Australians by five wickets, after dismissing them for 23 in their second innings with George Herbert Hirst and Stanley Jackson taking five wickets each.\nDonald Bradman's innings of 334 in the 1930 Ashes Test included 309 runs on the first day, and he followed it in the Australians' next test at Headingley in 1934 with an innings of 304.\nSpinner Hedley Verity took 10 wickets for 10 runs in 1932 for Yorkshire v. Nottinghamshire, still the best bowling analysis ever in first-class cricket. Verity had also taken all ten against Warwickshire at Headingley in 1931.\nIn the Fourth Test of the 1948 Ashes series, Australia scored 404 for three on the last day to beat England. Arthur Morris scored 182 and Bradman scored 173 not out.\nIn the Third Test against New Zealand in 1965 John Edrich hit 53 fours and 5 sixes in his 310 not out. Captain M. J. K. Smith declared before Edrich had a chance to pass Gary Sobers' Test record 365 not out, and England won by an innings and 187 runs.\nIn the third test match of the 1975 Ashes series (a four-Test series), early on Tuesday 19 August head groundsman George Cawthray discovered that campaigners calling for the release from prison of George Davis had dug holes in the pitch and poured oil over one end of the wicket. This led to the match being abandoned and declared a draw, denying England the chance to win back the Ashes.\nIn the 1977 Ashes test, Geoff Boycott scored his hundredth first-class hundred. Four days later, by winning the same game, England won the series and regained the Ashes.\nIn the third Test of the 1981 Ashes England were forced to follow on. However Ian Botham scored 149 not out, and then Bob Willis took eight wickets for 43, to give England an eventual 18-run victory. Two members of the Australian team had taken the 500–1 odds. This was only the second time in the entire history of Test cricket that a side had followed-on and won; something which would not occur again until 2001.\nIn the Test of 1991, Graham Gooch scored a match-winning 154 not out, carrying his bat throughout England's second innings of 252, against the West Indies including Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh.\nIn a game they had to win to stay in the 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup, the eventual cup-winners Australia chased down South Africa's 271 for seven after being 48 for three. Steve Waugh, who had been dropped by Herschelle Gibbs as he attempted to throw the ball up in celebration, scored 120 not out.\nIn 2000, England dismissed the West Indies for 61 to win in two days, with Andrew Caddick taking four wickets in an over. England won again seven years later in 2007, as Ryan Sidebottom took eight wickets for 86 in two innings as England subjected the Windies to their worst Test defeat ever, an innings and 283 runs.\nIn August 2001, England successfully chased 315 to beat Australia, with Mark Butcher scoring an unbeaten 173 as England won by six wickets. However, in August 2009 in the 4th test of The Ashes series, Australia beat England in days by an innings and 80 runs. Australia took twenty wickets with an attack without a spin bowler. England's middle order batsmen (Ravi Bopara, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood) scored 16 runs between them in two innings. However, these were rogue results, with the 2009 series being won by England and the 2001 series won by Australia. \nSachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid slammed centuries when India played England at Headingley from 22 to 26 August 2002. A venue where England used to bank on for home comforts showcased Team India's convincing win as the then visitors thrashed the Three Lions to clinch the 3rd Test of the four-match series.\nWhile Tendulkar top-scored for India with his majestic 193 off 330 balls, Ganguly played an entertaining knock of 128 off 167 balls. Ganguly and Tendulkar added 249 runs for the 4th wicket to help India register its highest total against England in 2002. In reply, Nasser Hussain's team folded for 273 in their 1st innings and India opted to impose a follow-on.\nSkipper Hussain then lifted England with his 110 off 194 in the 2nd innings. However, Hussain's century went in vain as England only mustered 309 in their 2nd innings. India recorded one of the biggest wins over England by winning the 3rd Test by an innings and 46 runs.\nOn 17 August 2017, Yorkshire Vikings posted the highest ever T20 score in English domestic cricket of 260–4, with Adam Lyth scoring the highest individual score (161) in English T20 domestic cricket.\nTwelve days later, Shai Hope scored two centuries in the test match between England and the West Indies, making him the first batsman in first-class cricket at Headingley to score a century in both innings of a match. \nIt hosted four matches at the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup.\nOn 25 August 2019, England chased down their highest ever fourth innings target in the third Test of the 2019 Ashes series against Australia. England scored 362-9 to win, with Ben Stokes scoring 135*, while being latterly partnered by Jack Leach who scored 1*.\nIn the third test of the 2023 Ashes, England had a 3-wicket win against Australia.\nPresent facilities.\nThe ground presently has a spectator capacity of 18,350 making it the fifth largest cricket ground in the United Kingdom by capacity. There is a large media centre to the north of the ground. Corporate facilities are situated in the Emerald Stand, the Carnegie Pavilion and the East Stand. The East Stand also contains banqueting facilities and the Headingley Lodge Hotel. The ground has floodlights enabling late play.\nRecent and future developments.\nYorkshire County Cricket Club are expanding the ground according to a six phase masterplan with points as follows\nRecords at the ground.\nIn Tests, the highest team score achieved at Headingley is 653-4 declared by Australia against England in 1993. The leading run scorers at the ground are Don Bradman (963 runs), Geoff Boycott (897 runs) and John Edrich (849 runs). The leading wicket takers are Stuart Broad (46 wickets), Fred Trueman (44 wickets) and James Anderson (42 wickets).\nIn ODIs, the highest team score achieved at Headingley is 351-9 by England against Pakistan on 19 May 2019. The leading run scorers at the ground are Eoin Morgan (477 runs), Joe Root (421 runs) and Marcus Trescothick (408 runs). The leading wicket takers are Chris Old (12 wickets), Adil Rashid (12 wickets) and Ian Botham (11 wickets).\nOther events.\nHeadingley Cricket Ground's first concert occurred on Friday 18 September 2015 when ska band Madness performed in front of an audience of 7,500.\nSponsorship.\nThe ground was named the Headingley Carnegie Stadium from 2006 to 2013 under a sponsorship deal with Leeds Metropolitan University. Upon the expiry of this deal the grounds name had no sponsor and was named simply Headingley Stadium until 2017 when a deal was done with the Emerald Group Search and Selection making it the Emerald Headingley Stadium. In 2021, Emerald Group pulled out of their sponsorship with immediate effect in the aftermath of the club's racism scandal.\nAccess.\nThe ground is served by Headingley and Burley Park railway stations as well as the First Leeds routes 19, 19A, 56 and 91 which stop right outside the front entrance of the stadium on Kirkstall Lane. \nAlong with this there are other buses which stop a short 5 min walk away on Otley Rd Headingley those are First Leeds services 1,6,8,27 and 28 and Yorkshire Buses service 29 \nOn certain match dates the R66 Shuttle Bus will run from Leeds City Centre to the stadium bus stop on Kirkstall Lane operated by First Leeds"

Normally an openside flanker, Mackay could also play blindside flanker and lock.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe started his rugby career playing for amateur side Glasgow Academicals.\nHe was to move from Academicals to Stirling County. He won the Division 1 championship with the club.\nDuring this time with the Glasgow professional side, Mackay also played for the amateur Glasgow Hawks. He won a league and cup double with them in 1997–98.\nProvincial career.\nHe frequently played for the amateur Glasgow District side and played for a combined Scottish district side against South Africa.\nProfessional career.\nWhen the district sides turned professional in 1996, Mackay played for the new Glasgow professional side in its guises as Glasgow Rugby and Glasgow Caledonians. He was to play for the Glasgow side 17 times. He played for Glasgow in their first European match; a European conference match - now European Challenge Cup - against the Welsh side Newbridge RFC.\nMackay then moved to France to play for Lyon OU. However it was there he suffered a neck injury which ended his rugby career.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped by Scotland Schools (Under 16s) against France and was later to be capped by Scotland's Under-21s against Wales.\nCoaching career.\nHe latterly took up coaching again with Glasgow Academicals. He saved the club from relegation in the 2007–08 season. As well as coaching he was involved in getting sponsorship for the club and getting new floodlights for the club.\nBusiness career.\nAfter his rugby playing career finished he ran the Jellyhill coffee shop in the West End of Glasgow for several years, alongside his wife Irenne. He also became involved in property development.\nDeath.\nHe died at his home in Glasgow with a suspected heart attack on 24 July 2008. Tributes flooded in. Former team-mate and Glasgow captain Gordon Bulloch said that Mackay was one of the best rugby players never to have won a full Scotland cap and another Glasgow team-mate Kenny Logan said that Mackay was one of the few larger than life rugby individuals in the professional era. A tribute match to celebrate his life was played in his honour at Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow Warriors staff Fergus Wallace and Iain Monaghan took part."

Haris Dajč, Vladimir Ninković, Darko Ivić and Nenad Dugić started organizing cricket training with the help of ex-Maharashtra player Mr. Amberish Sarang in October 2007. Soon new members and enthusiasts were added. With the help and support from Ms. Katherine Lawrence from the embassy of the United Kingdom, as well as gentlemen Nandikesh Nayar and Vimal Kumar Yadav from the embassy of the Republic of India, the full equipment was obtained as well as new instructors and players.\nIn 2009 the Serbia national cricket team, playing under the identity of the Belgrade Cricket Association, played their first international match against Slovenian club Mezica CC, winning one match, and losing one. The Serbian Cricket Federation was founded in 2009, and since then have been working hard on development all over the country.\nCurrent state and development.\nCurrently, Serbia have 120 registered cricketers, with plans to expand that to hopefully around 500 in the next few years. Although Serbia are not an ICC member yet, cricket has got the support of the Serbian government, who donate money to Serbian cricket. As a result of that, and their success of finding a number of sponsorship deals, Serbian cricket is completely self-supportive financially.\nOne very good thing about cricket in Serbia is its focus on local development and getting the game to the mainstream, which is very unusual in Europe. As a result, the vast majority of the Serbian players are local, from the mainstream population.\nSerbia cricket has pulled off a major victory for development by securing recognition for cricket as a mainstream sport by the government and the media. This provides Serbia cricket with a fund source, as well as creating interest in new markets for the game. Another byproduct of this is that the domestic and national team matches are covered by the major Serbian newspapers.\nSerbia was accepted as the 58th Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council in June 2015.\nFuture plans.\nSerbia's plans for 2015 included: Further promotion of the game of cricket in Serbia, expanding player basis and improving training conditions, providing basic playing facilities, organization of the first domestic competitions: cup and championship and organization of the first international match of the Serbia National Team and putting Serbia on the world cricket map."

        "title": "Ontario Junior C Lacrosse League",
        "text": "The Ontario Junior C Lacrosse League (OJCLL) is a box lacrosse league sanctioned by the Ontario Lacrosse Association in Canada. The league features teams split into three regional divisions. OJCLL annually play a 16-game schedule and playoffs for the Meredith Cup league championship.\nHistory.\nJunior C lacrosse was first sanctioned in Ontario in 1972. A seven-team league played a 20-game schedule and playoffs. After peaking in 1975 with 18 teams and three divisions, Junior C lacrosse dissolved after the 1979 season.\nA new OJCLL began operation in 2008 with five teams (Caledon Bandits, Centre Wellington Warlords, Innisfil Wolfpack, Shelburne Vets, West Durham Patriots). Caledon Bandits won that first 2008 title over Centre Wellington.\nIn 2009 the league added three more teams in Clarington, Kingston and Peterborough. The Caledon Bandits would defend their title defeating Peterborough 3–1 in the final best of five.\nWhile 2010 saw the same teams in the league however the West Durham team would relocate to Whitby plus we would see a new champion in the Clarington Shamrox which would be their first of three titles in a row as they took out Centre Wellington 3–0 in the final.\nThe 2011 season saw a huge change in the league as it expanded from eight teams with the addition of Halton Hills, Hamilton, Mimico and Wilmot in the west. Eastern expansion included new teams in Brockville, Cornwall, Gloucester, Kahnawake and Nepean. The Huntsville Hawks would also drop down from Junior \"B\" to join the league while the Centre Wellington Warlords ownership changed and were rebranded as the Fergus Thistles. Clarington Shamrox would take their second title with a win over Peterborough Lakers.\nThe 2012 campaign saw the league lose two east clubs after just one season as Nepean and Kahnawake did not return. Clarington would take their third title in a row over Halton Hills in the final.\nIn 2013 the league would stay the same in the number of teams at 16 however there would be a new champion crowned as the Halton Hills Bulldogs took the title in an overtime thriller in Cornwall defeating the three time champs from Clarington 11–10. It was the last year of the tournament format to crown a champion.\nIn 2014 the league lost another eastern team as Brockville Ballistic ceased operations while the Oakville Hawks and the Six Nations Warriors came in. The league switched back to an East-West division format which saw the Cornwall Celtics defeat the defending champions from Halton Hills 3–0 to win their first title.\nThe 2015 season saw the Kingston Kings and Hamilton Bengals cease operations. The Peterborough Lakers would claim their first championship as they swept the Six Nations Warriors 3–0 in the league finals.\nThere was controversy during the 2015 season involving the Six Nations Warriors, who finished with 16 wins and no losses to close out the regular season. It was soon brought to the attention of the Ontario Lacrosse Association that the Warriors had multiple roster violations. In turn, the Warriors forfeited 13 of their wins and dropped from first place in the West Division to seventh. The Warriors would sweep the first two rounds of the playoffs and would not lose a game on the floor until Game 3 of the West Division Finals against the Fergus Thistles. In the 2015 Meredith Cup Finals, the Six Nations Warriors would fall to the Lakers, who swept the series in three games (10–7, 10–3, 9–4).\n2016 would see a shift in power in the West Division. The 2015 West champion Warriors dropped to third in the regular season standings while Wilmot Wild and the Fergus Thistles tied for top spot with identical 14–2 records. Both clubs would coast through the first two rounds of the postseason before meeting up in the West finals for the first time. The Wild would get the better of the Thistles by sweeping the series 3–0 en route to their first-ever Meredith Cup Finals appearance.\nSince 2014, the East division has been dominated by the play of the Peterborough Lakers and the Clarington Shamrox. They faced off in the East finals in 2015 and again in 2016. In what will go down as one of the most tightly contested playoff series in league history, the Shamrox would eventually eke out a 4–3 win in Game 5 in front of a packed Garnett B. Rickard Arena in Clarington. Clarington went on to sweep the Wild 4–0 despite some close contests. It was their fourth Meredith Cup in seven years. The Shelburne Vets, one of the original five teams from the league reboot, would play their last game in 2016.\nAn operating agreement between the OLA and the FCQ in 2018 added two teams to the OJCLL. The North Shore Kodiaks and South Shore Centurions, members of the FCQ from the Montreal area, became the first members of an OLA Junior league from a different province.\nIn 2019, the Whitby Warriors would complete the first-ever perfect season, completing a 16–0 regular season while sweeping each team on route to their first Meredith Cup. After a first-round bye, the Warriors handled the Clarington Shamrox, winning 16–7, 9–5, and 17–10. In the second straight year, the Warriors would battle with the Peterborough Lakers in the East Finals. The Warriors finally got their chance to take down the Lakers, and swept the series by scores of 21–8, 17–10, and 17–6. Whitby would face the Fergus Thistles in the finals with each game decided by one goal. The Warriors finished the series off in Game 4 to cap off the perfect 26–0 season. During the season Matt Shand would set the season points record with 109 (31 goals, 78 assists) in just 14 games. The former Green Gaels Jr. B standout would add another 68 points in nine playoff games. Mike Andersson would set the rookie season points record with 77 (39 goals and 38 assists) and finish second overall in scoring that year.\nThe Orangeville Northmen joined the league in 2022, quickly finding success and winning the Meredith Cup in their very first season.\n2023 ushered in change for the OJCLL, with Barrie's Jim Lowe taking over the role of Commissioner from Reg Hollinshead, who was elected Vice-President Junior to Major Lacrosse for the OLA. The North Shore Kodiaks became the first Quebec team to win a regular season Conference Championship title, while Evan MacDougall of Fergus broke the rookie season points record with 92 (43 goals and 49 assists), becoming the youngest player ever to capture the Junior C scoring title. The Kodiaks would go on to win the Meredith Cup, the only Quebec team to do so in the history of the Championship.\nThe OJCLL welcomed a new expansion team from Akwesasne, the Phantoms, for the 2024 season. A off-season dispute between the OLA and FCQ resulted in the operating agreement that had permitted the Kodiaks and the Centurions to compete in the league. A subsequent agreement provided OLA membership to the Kodiaks for 2024 and 2025, ensuring that the team could attempt to defend its 2023 Meredith Cup Championship."

After spending 2012 and 2013 with Rookie League clubs, in 2014 Perdomo made 2 starts with the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League State College Spikes and 11 starts with the Class A Midwest League Peoria Chiefs, putting up a 4.43 ERA between the two levels. In 2015, Perdomo started the year with the Chiefs. He was named the Cardinals Minor League Baseball Pitcher of the Month for May, posting a 1.42 ERA and striking out 33 in innings. In July, he was the Cardinals representative at the All-Star Futures Game, taking the place of the injured Alex Reyes. After posting a 3.68 ERA in 17 starts with the Chiefs, Perdomo was promoted to the Class A-Advanced Palm Beach Cardinals in August, where he made 5 starts and had a 5.13 ERA.\nPerdomo was selected by the Colorado Rockies in the 2015 Rule 5 draft, and then traded to the San Diego Padres for a player to be named later or cash considerations.\nSan Diego Padres.\nAs a Rule 5 selection, Perdomo was added to the Padres bullpen for 2016 despite being hit hard in Spring Training and never having pitched above the A-Advanced level. He was moved into the rotation in June as the Padres lost other starting pitchers to trades or injuries. On August 28, he threw his first complete game, earning a 3–1 victory over the Miami Marlins. Perdomo finished the season with a 9–10 record and a 5.71 ERA, although he improved over the season and had a better ERA as a starter (4.85) than as a reliever (9.10).\nPerdomo was named the Padres fifth starter coming out of Spring Training in 2017. After missing some time with a sore shoulder in April, Perdomo remained in the starting rotation for the remainder of the year. He posted an 8–11 record and a 4.67 ERA in 29 starts, with 118 strike-outs in innings pitched. He was 3rd on the club in innings pitched, behind Clayton Richard and Jhoulys Chacín, and led the National League in ground ball rate.\nPerdomo won a spot in the Padres' 2018 starting rotation. On April 11 of that year, in a game against the Colorado Rockies, Perdomo threw a pitch behind Nolan Arenado, causing Arenado to charge towards Perdomo. Perdomo flung his glove at Arenado and dodged in a split second to avoid the tackle, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. On April 13, Perdomo was suspended for five games. He was placed on the disabled list on July 28 with a right shoulder strain. He ended the season 1–6 in 12 appearances (10 starts). He had an ERA of 7.05 in innings. In 2019, Perdomo pitched exclusively out of the bullpen, totaling 47 appearances while making just 1 start. He was 2–4 with an even 4.00 ERA.\nIn mid-October 2020, Perdomo underwent Tommy John surgery. On November 20, 2020, the Padres designated Perdomo for assignment.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn December 16, 2020, Perdomo signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers organization. He did not play in a game in 2021 as he recovered from injury. He was assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds to begin the 2022 season.\nOn May 6, 2022, Perdomo was selected to the 40-man and active rosters. In 14 appearances for Milwaukee, he posted a 3.80 ERA with 12 strikeouts in innings pitched. On November 18, Perdomo was non-tendered and became a free agent.\nChiba Lotte Marines.\nOn January 13, 2023, Perdomo signed with the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). The contract came with a $1.3 million guarantee and incentives that can boost the total to $1.8 million. In 53 appearances for the Lotte, he registered a 2.13 ERA with 41 strikeouts across innings of work. Perdomo became a free agent following the season.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn February 8, 2024, Perdomo signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. He was released by Washington on March 21.\nOn April 24, 2024, Perdomo signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League."

The Panthers compete in NCAA Division I as a member of Conference USA (C-USA). The Panthers play their home matches at the GSU Sand Volleyball Complex on the university's Atlanta campus, and are currently led by head coach Beth Van Fleet.\nHistory.\nWith the emergence of football at Georgia State University, due to Title IX scholarship restrictions, it was necessary for GSU to increase the number of women's scholarships available in their athletic program\nThe creation of beach volleyball at Georgia State was announced on September 27, 2011, by Georgia State Athletic Director Cheryl Levick. \nConstruction of the GSU Sand Volleyball Complex, a 340-seat, 3 tiered court set, began in April 2012, and was completed by September 2012. The site has unofficially been nicknamed \"The Beach.\"\nOriginally named as head coach of beach volleyball, head coach Tami Audia was elevated to Director of Volleyball, being replaced by assistant coach Beth Van Fleet in July 2013.\nOn October 20, 2015, Georgia State joined the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association (CCSA) as a beach volleyball member, coinciding with the NCAA's decision to sponsor it and provide a championship, as well as the addition of beach volleyball as an official CCSA sport (which led to that conference changing its name from the original Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association). This also coincided with the NCAA changing the name of the sport from \"sand\" to \"beach\" volleyball.\nDuring the 2020–21 school year, the CCSA entered into a formal beach volleyball partnership with Conference USA (C-USA) that saw the 2021 CCSA tournament split into two divisions, with GSU joining fellow Sun Belt member Louisiana–Monroe and full C-USA members Florida Atlantic, FIU, Southern Miss, and UAB in one of the divisions. After that season, the CCSA and C-USA agreed to split their beach volleyball membership, with the six aforementioned schools and another full Sun Belt member, Coastal Carolina, forming the new C-USA beach volleyball league.\nHome Court/Practice and Training facilities.\nThe GSU Beach Volleyball Complex is the home court and practice facility for the women's beach volleyball team."

It gained membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) the following year, and the Indonesian national team made its debut in 2002.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCricket was introduced to colonial Indonesia (the Dutch East Indies) in the early 1880s, by Dutch workers. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa was reported to have interrupted a match being played in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), by the members of the Bataviasche Cricket Club. That club was joined in September 1893 by the Bataviasche Cricket-Football Club, which was incorporated in May 1894. Cricket and association football were introduced to the country around the same time, and many of the early clubs played both sports. Gymnastiek Vereeniging, founded in Medan in November 1887, was one such club, and in 1890 played fixtures in both sports against a club from Penang (in present-day Malaysia). The Singapore Cricket Club was also reported to have visited. The rise of cricket in the Dutch East Indies coincided with a decline in popularity in the Netherlands, as many Dutch players moved to the colonies. However, Dutchmen were not the sport's only players, with at least one club in Batavia being formed by the British community. That city maintained a cricket ground until the 1960s, on the site of the present National Monument.\nRecent years.\nThe recent history of cricket in Indonesia began in 1981, when the International Sports Club of Indonesia established a cricket section. Indonesia's first cricket league was established in 1992, when the Jakarta Cricket Association (JCA) was founded. Outside of Jakarta, leagues were established in the provinces of Bali and East Nusa Tenggara in the 1990s, and in West Java in the 2000s. The Indonesia Cricket Foundation (now known as Cricket Indonesia) was founded in 2000 by representatives from the Bali and Jakarta leagues. It gained affiliate membership of the ICC in 2001, and an Indonesian national team made its international debut the following year, in a four-team tournament in Perth, Australia, that also featured Japan and South Korea. The national side has since regularly played in ICC East Asia-Pacific regional tournaments. Cricket Indonesia has emphasized on expanding cricket into schools, and in both 2008 and 2009 won ICC development awards for its Ultra Milk Development Programme, which \"reached over 22,000 students in 500 schools\". A 2010 \"Jakarta Post\" article reported that cricket was played by 30,000 Indonesians across 14 provinces. Despite not being included in the original programme, cricket has been included as a sport at the 2018 Asian Games (to be hosted by Jakarta and Palembang), following lobbying efforts by Cricket Indonesia and the Olympic Council of Asia.\nPlayers.\nAt least three first-class cricketers are known to have been born in present-day Indonesia, all of whom were of British descent:"

        "title": "Barbara Stevens (basketball)",
        "text": "Barbara Stevens (born September 20, 1954) is the former head coach of the Bentley University women's basketball team. Stevens had previously served as head basketball coach for Clark University and Massachusetts. Stevens was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. She was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.\nIn January 2018, Stevens became the fifth women's basketball coach to reach the 1,000 win milestone. Bentley defeated Adelphi University 78–66. Bentley had lost to Adelphi in their last four meetings.\nHigh school.\nStevens attended two high schools, Marianhill Central Catholic High School in Southbridge, Massachusetts, then Saint Peter-Marian High School in Worcester, Massachusetts. She played sports, but noted in an article about the history of Title IX, at the time \"it was almost embarrassing sometimes to be known as a female athlete\".\nCollege.\nStevens attended college at Bridgewater State College in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, graduating in 1976. She played on the school basketball team as a point guard, and was named captain. She noted about the experience, \"Those of us who were interested in sports did play, but in front of very few people and with very little fanfare and very little notice. How we practiced, the amount of time and what we did to get ready for season are just so different now.\" In addition to basketball, she also played on the softball team for two years and on the tennis team for two years where she was also named captain.\nCoaching career.\nStevens started her coaching career as an assistant coach at Clark University in 1976. The school was not known as a solid basketball team but she helped the team win the Massachusetts Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (MAIAW) Division III State Championship. The team record was 14–5. Stevens was named as head coach the following year. She remained the head coach at Clark for six seasons with three MAIAW titles and five postseason appearances. Twice, the team reached the NCAA Division III Final Four. In her final year at Clark she was named the WBCA coach of the year for district 1.\nShe took over the head coaching duties at Massachusetts in 1983, inheriting a team that had a record of 5-22 in the prior year. Under Stevens leadership, the team improved to 10–17, but they were unable to reach the .500 mark. Despite the modest record, her skills as a coach were recognized. In her final year at Massachusetts, her team played Connecticut, which at the time was not a recognized basketball power. They were coached by Geno Auriemma, who would go on to be named to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, the Basketball Hall of Fame, and twice named as the Olympic coach, but at the time he was in his first year as a coach. It was his seventh game as a coach. He noted that Massachusetts had beaten UConn the previous year and they were leading by substantial margin in this game. Then he noticed \"something clicked\" and the players began applying what they had learned in practice. UConn ended up winning the game 62–59; Auriemma rates it as one of his favorite memories and said of UMass, \"they are a good team, well coached by Barbara Stevens. She's great.\"\nStevens came to Bentley in 1986. Her first year was a good year as the team achieved a record of 24–5. In her second year the team won 28 games. In 1988, her teams started a five-year string of 30 or more victories each year. Between 1992 and 2014, Stevens was named the National Division II Coach of the Year by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association five times in 1992, 1999, 2001, 2013, and 2014.\nIn 2014, the team went undefeated with a 35–0 record. Bentley reached the national championship game against West Texas A&amp;M. With under six minutes remaining, the team was losing by nine points. One of the players asked the coach if they could go into their full-court pressure defense. Three of the players had four fouls, making such a tactic dangerous but they implemented the press and it was effective. Late in the game, Lauren Battista scored a three-pointer to put the Falcons ahead, then stole the inbounds pass and scored to give Bentley a 65–61 lead to put them ahead for good. The win gave Stevens her first national championship.\nStevens Court.\nIn March 2018, Bentley University made the decision to name the basketball court in the Dana Athletic Center after Stevens. At the naming ceremony, the president of the University, Gloria Cordes Larson said, \"Coach Stevens has arguably become one of the top five coaches in the history of all women’s basketball -- and certainly the best ever in NCAA Division II. It’s hard to imagine that anyone will ever come close to replicating the success she and her program have achieved.\"\nHead coaching record.\nSource"

        "text": "The Cycling Federation of Nigeria or CFN was established in 1972 as the national governing body of cycle racing in Nigeria. It is a member of the International Cycling Union and African Cycling Federation.\nCycling Federation of Nigeria is the body empowered by the Federal Government of Nigeria to govern and promote Cycling sport in Nigeria. Cycling as an organized sporting activity started back in Nigeria since 1972 and has grown over the years to a popular promotional and award-winning sport. Meanwhile, all the Cycling Associations in Nigeria are affiliated to the Cycling Federation of Nigeria.\nCycling is one of the oldest sporting events in Nigeria. Before then, the sport was for leisure, recreation and to keep fit (physical fitness). The national governing body was made up of members nominated and approved from parts of the regions. Cycling is one of the most expensive sports due to cost of equipment and parts which are imported from developed and industrialized countries like Europe, America and Asia. The cost effect, make it difficult for many people or clubs to be involved or procure the special bicycle and outfits.\nIn the early 70s, the governing body of the sport was known as Nigeria Amateur Cycling Association. This body over ruled and regulated other bodies formed in then four (4) regions in Nigeria namely: Northern, Western, Mid Western and Eastern regions. It was introduced into the country as far back as the early days of colonialism. The ownership and use of bicycle by some privileged African then was indeed a mark of arrival. It was prestigious to own a bicycle in those days.\nThe first coaching course took place in Kaduna at the Northern part of Nigeria. The second was at Ibadan, and then the third was at the University of Ife, from 19 August to September, 1976. Cycling competition was first organized in Nigeria on 18 – 24 November 1973.\nThe first Cycling Club in Nigeria known as “ Armstong Cycling Club” was formed in Lagos in 1956 with Pa Sobayo as the founder and first Chairman. Other prominent members of the club then were Rev. Father Slattery, Chief Kunle Oyero and Prince T. O. Alade. A reliable source has it that the first President of Nigeria Hon. Nnamdi Azikwe was the patron of the Club. In 1962, a group of enthusiastic young men, like J. J Umoh, S. S Bassey, O. O Adeke and U. U Samuel joined the club as cyclists.\nThe first known modern cycling race in Nigeria was organized by “Raleigh” and it was held in Lagos in 1962. The race was won by of the pioneer cyclist J. J Umoh, information has it that the race was a distance of 20 miles.\nAfter the creation of States from the then four regions, each State formed their Cycling Associations known as State Amateur Cycling Association. This body became the governing board to oversee the development of cycling. The state associations are overruled by the Nigeria Amateur cycling Association, which became known as Cycling Federation of Nigeria today.\nNigeria Cycling participated for the first time in the African Continental Championship that was held in Sharm-El-Sheik in Egypt in 2013 and won a Silver medal in the Elite Women Team Time Trial."

        "text": "Archery at the 2016 Summer Paralympics was held between 10 and 17 September 2016 at the Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí in the Maracana zone of Rio de Janeiro, and consisted of nine events. The make up of those events changed substantially from the 2012 games, and consisted of three men's events, three women's events and three events for mixed gender teams. Men, women and mixed teams each competed in two events for compound bow, one for wheelchair athletes, the other open, and an open event for recurve bow, the bow used for all Olympic events.\nClassification and events.\nParalympic archers are given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allowed archers to compete against others with a similar level of function. The categories have been reduced by one for 2016, with the two wheelchair classifications combined, and the replacement of 'standing' with an 'open' category. The W1 classification for wheelchair archers has been retained.\nThere are two categories of competition in Paralympic archery in 2016:\nA third recognised Paralympic archery classification, V1, for visually impaired archers, is not part of the 2016 Games.\nQualification.\nIndividual events.\nA National Paralympic Committee (NPC) could be allocated a maximum of thirteen qualification slots across the nine events, except for the NPCs of the 2015 Para Archery World Champions. It could also qualify a maximum of three archers per individual event, and could field a team of one man and one woman in the mixed gender team events, selected from individual qualifiers.\nThe majority of quota places were awarded for performances in the 2015 World Championships, and the continental qualification events (including the 2015 Parapan American Games). A smaller number are then awarded, if applicable, to the host nation, to the highest ranked archers at a Final Paralympic Qualifying tournament, and under the discretion of the tripartite committee.\nMixed team events.\nThere is no direct qualification for the mixed pairs events, and an NPC may enter one team (1 man, 1 woman) per event if they have qualified those archers from individual events. However, since Rio 2016 quota places in individual events were awarded to the top finishers in the equivalent mixed pairs event at the 2015 World Para Archery Championships in Donau, Germany, a minimum number of teams per event is guaranteed.\nCompetition schedule.\nCompetition lasts from 10 to 17 September. Each day from 11 September, 10 September being the Ranking Round for all archers, contains a morning and afternoon session, and will see at least one set of medals awarded.\nThe full daily schedule is set out below.\nParticipating nations.\n137 archers from 40 nations competed.\nMedal summary.\nGreat Britain topped the Archery medal table, thanks mainly to their domination of the W1 events, winning all three golds available, and taking the only clean sweep of the tournament by winning all three medals in the women's individual W1 event; outside of the W1 events, China and Iran were the most successful nations, sharing five golds and nine medals between them. Olympic number one nation, South Korea could not match their Olympic success, and exited the Games with three medals, a silver and two bronze."

        "title": "Women's Professional Motocross",
        "text": "Motocross is an off-road racing sport that is raced on a dirt bike around a track, there are multiple riders going around at a time and the first person to complete the required number of laps in the shortest period of time wins. The women's motocross league is separate from men's motocross because of the different rules, and also the different bike sizes. Women generally race bikes that are 125cc or 250cc because they are not big enough to ride a 450cc. These differences make it hard for men and women to compete together however it is done and is allowed. Women compete in the AMA races but rarely make it into the main event because their practice laps and heat laps are not fast enough. Women's professional motocross has the support of professional male riders also. Male riders think that growing the sport in any way possible is a positive and that the more people riding the better the sport will be. As well as having the support from male riders, females are starting to step up and support their colleagues as well, by helping each other train and practice, there is support from both males and females that is helping the sport to go exponentially.\nBackground and history.\nMotocross started in approximately 1924 over in Europe and spread very quickly to the United States due to immigration and the moving of families for job and freedom opportunities. Women's professional motocross is an organized sports league where females can compete for money and prizes at the highest level of motocross. Women's motocross began in Europe in the early 1950s and 1960s and moved to the United States in the middle of the 1960s. This was during the time that women's equality movements were strong, helping the sport to grow. In 1971 Kerry Kleid was the first woman to receive a professional motocross rider license, which was revoked after it was discovered that she was a woman. When processing her license paperwork, the registry did not know that she was a female because there was no box that indicated this information. When she showed up at the first race in Unadilla, she was told that she could not race because she was a woman. Kerry then went to court and eventually won her license back. However, this was the first time in history when women understood that they could be professionals in the world of motocross. In 1974 the first Powder Puff National Championship took place which marked the first time that a specifically women's National Championship was available for female motocross riders in the United States. The \"Powder Puff\" was a motocross event where women could race in heats in order to qualify for the main event, or the last race of the night with the chance to win the championship. In 1975 the event's name was changed from the Powder Puff National Championship to the Women's Motocross Nationals. The championship took place ever year consecutively from 1975 through today, although in 1982 and 1986 the races were not held. In 1996 the Women's Motocross League (WML) was founded after the first Women's Supercross Championships took place in 1995. Because of this the WML was allowed to petition to be a part of the AMA Pro Motocross Championship, which included the men's ranks and races. This led to the creation of the Women's Motocross Association, which was founded in 2004 and sold to MX Sports, a large motocross corporation, in 2009. The selling of this allows for women's motocross to remain a permanent part of men's motocross and the motocross industry. This also caused a change in the naming of WMA to WMX, so that it would fit in with the rest of the corporation. In order to keep women racing factory teams started to offer female riders contracts so that they could get the women to race their motorcycles. Factory teams are large corporations and the main companies that produce and distribute motorcycles. There are over 250 factory teams in the United States alone including the major ones Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, KTM, and Kawasaki. Without these sponsorships and contracts it is nearly impossible for a person to support a professional race team on their own, the cost is too much. In order to receive a factory ride, the women had to prove that they were on top of the game and that they were willing to work hard and put the hours necessarily in to get better. The training that they endure goes beyond just riding their dirt bike, it happens in the gym and on pedal bikes as well. These riders worked for the best bikes that money could buy, because if they did not they would be out of a job and also unable to support their racing. It costs over $200,000.00 a year for an elite motocross rider to be ready for the season. This includes having the best bike, the best trainers, spare parts, a way to get the bikes to the track, fuel costs and many more expenses.\nCulture.\nWomen's motocross is full of people who have a no quit mentality and are often heard saying things like \" I won't quit until I am physically unable to ride\". These mentalities are what keeps the sport alive and well, without them it would have died long ago. Women's motocross is a sport that requires dedication and constant work, so the people who are involved in it, both the riders and the teams, have to be mentally strong. In order to make this sport a success women had to put in hard work and be mentally strong, they heard the word no more times than most but kept going. Having a strong mentality is what allows women's sports at the professional level to be a success. Much like the male counterpart, professional women's racing requires hours of training in order to be on top. This league is full of only the best riders and the most successful women, so without the mental aspect, these women would not be able to compete in the league. The biological level of mental toughness plays a large role in the success of this sport, women who have had parents who did not allow them to quit and who pushed them harder than they thought they could be pushed often came out on top because they were trained not to quit. There are physiological reasons that some athletes possess the ability to be best, the way that their mind functions and the hormonal excretions in their body allow them to push themselves hard and longer than the regular person. It was in their mind and heart to be the best, much like every other athlete, how a competitor does their job says a lot about who they are as a person, and how far they are willing to go in order to win.\nMost influential female rider.\nThere rider who stands out of the pack when talking about women's motocross is Ashley Fiolek, she has the ability to go above and beyond the normal realm of what is expected of the female rider. , She is the fastest female on the track and knows it, with a confidence that most women dream of having she takes each lap for what it is and has a level head that allows her to keep pushing and progressing.\nAshley Fiolek.\nAshley Fiolek, a native of Dearborn Michigan, born on October 22, 1990, is the most accomplished rider of this generation. She has won more amateur and professional races than anyone else in her age group and has stayed on top for the longest period of time. She was born deaf which is one of the most important reasons for why she starting racing. Because Ashley was unable to hear and participate easily in team sports, she picked up riding due to the fact that she could do it by herself and not have to talk or hear anything other than the bike. Being deaf served as one of her greatest advantages while racing because she could not hear what was going on outside the track, she only had to focus on what she was doing which allowed her to dial in and focus at a level that most other riders are unable to do. She is able to get on the track and block everything else out other than the things that she is focusing on, such as jumping, cornering and passing competitors. Ashley started racing dirt bikes when she was just 7 years old and has been racing ever since. Fiolek is a factory rider for Team Honda, with whom she has been signed ever since she was young. They give her the support that she needs in order to run the cleanest and most successful bike on the track. Through their sponsorship, Ashely is able to ride one of the best bikes available. At the young age of 21 Fiolek walked away from racing in the pros due to the impossible contracts and because the sport that she loved was taking a turn that she did not want to continue on with. Ashley now trains younger riders to be the best racers that they can. Though there are other influential riders in women's motocross, none hold the same list of accomplishments that Ashley does."

        "title": "Ron Dorsey (basketball, born 1983)",
        "text": "Ronald Houdini Dorsey (born November 2, 1983) is an American former professional basketball player. The 6'6\" swingman played two seasons of college basketball for McNeese State before venturing to Europe, where he played in Finland, Lithuania and France. He is most notable for his time spent in Australia and New Zealand, where he helped lead the Cairns Taipans to the 2011 Australian NBL Grand Final and the Auckland Pirates to the 2012 New Zealand NBL Championship.\nCollege career.\nDorsey, a Detroit, Michigan native, played two seasons of junior college for Schoolcraft College before signing with the McNeese State men's basketball program in April 2003. Over two seasons for the Cowboys, Dorsey averaged 6.5 points and 3.3 rebounds in 53 games.\nProfessional career.\nBetween 2005 and 2007, Dorsey had two successful seasons playing in Finland and Lithuania, averaging 23 points per game for Kauhajoen Karhu in 2005–06, and 15 points per game for Neptūnas in 2006–07. He helped Neptūnas finish third in the regular season, as they made it the farthest in the playoffs in club history.\nIn 2007, Dorsey moved to France, where he signed with SPO Rouen Basket of the LNB Pro B. He averaged 16.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game in 2007–08 and helped Rouen finish first on the season, subsequently promoting them to the Pro A for the 2008–09 season. He remained with the team in 2008–09 and averaged 12.5 points per game.\nIn 2009, Dorsey returned to the Pro B, signing with Étendard de Brest. He managed just half a season with Étendard due to a shoulder injury suffered in January 2010. In 15 games, he averaged 12.6 points and 3.1 rebounds per game.\nAfter recovering from the injury, Dorsey received an opportunity to attend a San Antonio Spurs mini camp in September 2010. The following month, he signed with the Cairns Taipans for the 2010–11 NBL season. Dorsey marked a special place in the club's history after draining a miraculous long three-pointer to send Game 2 of the 2011 NBL Grand Final series against the New Zealand Breakers into double overtime. Despite winning that game, they lost the series 2–1, but that didn't stop Dorsey's heroics going down in club folklore. In 33 games for the Taipans in 2010–11, he averaged 13.1 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.4 steals per game.\nOn May 25, 2011, Dorsey signed a two-year deal with the Melbourne Tigers. After averaging 11 points per game in 2011–12, he was released from the second year of his contract.\nIn March 2012, Dorsey signed with the Auckland Pirates for the 2012 New Zealand NBL season. He helped the Pirates win the championship in 2012, scoring 18 points in the team's 89–83 grand final win over the Wellington Saints. In 13 games for the Pirates, he averaged 16.7 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.4 steals per game.\nOn December 21, 2012, Dorsey signed with Rosa Radom of the Polish Basketball League. He spent the rest of the 2012–13 season with the Polish club, where he averaged 5.9 points and 2.2 rebounds in 16 games.\nIn March 2017, after being out of the game for four years, Dorsey joined Mexican team Águilas Doradas de Durango of the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pacífico. In four games for Durango, he averaged 7.0 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.\nPersonal.\nDuring his time away from playing professionally between 2013 and 2017, Dorsey began running a basketball coaching business in Louisiana."

        "title": "Little League World Series (Far East Region)",
        "text": "The Far East East Region was one of four international regions that competed in the Little League World Series from 1962 to 2000. Far East qualifiers won a record 23 titles — 17 from Taiwan, four from Japan, and two from the Republic of Korea.\nTeams from East Asia were first allowed to qualify for the Little League World Series in 1961. A team from Japan lost to Hawaii in the original Pacific Region's qualifying game. The following year the Far East Region was created, with the Japanese champion receiving an automatic berth in the World Series. The first multinational Far East Regional Tournament took place in 1969 and featured six countries.\nIn 2001, the Little League World Series was expanded to sixteen teams. The Far East was split into two regions – the Pacific (consisting of teams from the Pacific Islands, Indonesia, and Oceania) and Asia (consisting of teams from mainland Asia). Originally, Japan was to become its own region. In , the regions were again reconfigured to match the original plan. Japan was given an automatic berth in the Series, while the remaining Asian teams merged with the Pacific teams to create the Asia-Pacific Region.\nControversies.\n1975 ban.\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Taiwan dominated the LLWS, outscoring their opponents 112–2. In , they did not allow a hit.\nOn November 11, 1974, Little League Baseball announced that all non-US teams were banned from competing in the Little League World Series. Initially, travel costs and nationalism were the reasons given. But, many made the connection to the success of the Far East teams. A representative of the Taiwanese Baseball Association also read between the lines, \"We are suffering from a strange phenomenon, we are too good.\"\nSeveral months later, Little League Baseball did give a more detailed reason for the ban. \"There was too much emphasis on this particular age group, and this happened in Latin America, as well as the Far East and other places in which it became a more Olympic type activity.\nDespite being banned from the Little League World Series, international leagues still held regional championships. In the 1975 Far East Tournament, Taiwan defeated Japan in a controversial contest. The ban was only limited to the Little League division. International teams could still compete at the Senior and Big League World Series. Taiwan would win both of those tournaments, the Far East hegemony encompassed each level of youth baseball.\nIn December 1975, the international ban was repealed with a 12–1 vote. The decision came with a caveat; the tournament would now be split into two brackets. One side for the U.S. teams, and the other for the internationals. This would give the U.S. a 50/50 chance of winning the championship every year, but it also made the road easier for the Far East and Latin America teams. The four international regions—Canada, Europe, Far East, and Latin America—were not all at the same skill level. The lesser skill levels of the Canada Region and Europe Region teams therefore turned the international side into a foregone conclusion; the Far East Region or Latin America Region champion would make the final game every year that followed the bracket split.\n1992 Zamboanga City disqualification.\nFor the first time ever, a team from the Philippines won the Far East Region tournament. The team headed to Williamsport and advanced to the final. The championship game, against Long Beach, California, was a blowout, with Zamboanga City winning, 15-4, after a 7-run first inning. The team was hailed as heroes in the Philippines, with President Ramos giving the team a gift of 1 million pesos to contribute to the livelihood of their families. Long Beach head coach Jeff Burroughs remarked that semi-final pitcher Roberto Placious had the poise of a high school or college pitcher.\nThere had been some suspicions about the Zamboanaga City team soon after it arrived in Williamsport. Several committee members didn't think the manager and coach seemed \"typical.\" However, nothing more came of it after assurances were given that the manager and coach were from the same league as the players and had coached in that league during the regular season. A few days after Zamboanga City's triumphant victory, however, journalist Al Mendoza of the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" began publishing stories suggesting that some players were ineligible. He'd received letters from several neighbors and relatives claiming that several players were too old for Little League. Local administrator Armando Andaya was faxed four questions from Little League president Creighton Hale, regarding player ages, birth certificates, residence, and a specific question regarding winning championship game pitcher Ian Tolentino's participation in a tournament in 1990 (possibly with the view of suggesting this would have made him over-age). Andaya admitted to violating rules on district representation - eight players were from outside the Zamboanga City area, some as far away as Luzon, and unable to speak Chabacano, the language most commonly spoken in Zamboanga. Andaya claimed that the eight players replaced, for various reasons, were unable to go to China for the Far East series and that the out-of-district substitutes were only used to make up numbers rather than to give the team an extra edge over their opponents. He also admitted that the team's original coach had been replaced with someone from Manila.\nLittle League Baseball stripped Zamboanga City of its title. Under Little League rules at the time, when a team was found to have used an ineligible player, it forfeited only its most recent game (otherwise they would have to put the entire tournament on hold while the teams that lost to the illegal team were put back into the tournament). Since the revelation was made after the championship game, that game was declared a 6-0 forfeit victory by Long Beach, which was awarded the championship. The exposed players and parents remained defiant, and accused Little League Baseball of denying them due process.\nWith many Filipinos outraged at what they saw as an unpatriotic betrayal by Mendoza, who was given the key to the city of Long Beach, fellow Inquirer journalist Armand N. Nocum conducted further investigation \nand found that even the six true Zamboangueños were over-age, including at least two as old as 15, and thus ineligible. It was discovered that, as with the eight non-district players, the fraud had been maintained by the players' assumption of identities of (eligible) players who had represented the city at the national championships, the families of whom were reportedly willing to reveal all, jealous of the prizes bestowed upon the players who had used their sons' identities to represent their country at the Far East and World Series. In some cases, even the parents of the ineligible players assumed appropriate identities to maintain the appearance of propriety. Nocum, a native of the area, had not wanted to believe such an egregious fraud was taking place, but discovered that even school officials were in on the cover-up. Later, Nocum, seemingly backing Andaya's assertion that the substitutes were not chosen to artificially inflate the team's performance, told \"Sports Illustrated\" that had the original Zamboanga City team participated in the World Series, they would have trounced Long Beach by at least 30-4.\nIn an interesting post-script, Zamboanga City was disqualified from the Filipino national titles the very next year in another over-age player scandal.\n1993 Far East Tournament.\nFollowing the Zamboanga City scandal, Little League announced that they would be enforcing boundary and age limits more strictly. At the 1993 Far East Tournament Taiwan defeated Japan to claim yet another berth in Williamsport. South Korea and China rounded out the top 4. The World Series berth, however, was given to the fifth place team from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands. The top 4 had all failed to meet the new rule requirements and were disqualified. The team from Saipan went 1–2 in Williamsport, making it the first time since 1970 that Far East Champion did not make the semifinals.\nThe Latin America champion from the Dominican Republic was also disqualified under similar circumstances.\nTaiwan leaves Little League.\nIn April 1997, the Taiwan Baseball Association decided that its youth baseball programs would no longer affiliate with Little League. “The leagues in Taiwan were unable at that time to adhere to certain Little League rules and regulations regarding residency, and the area from which a single chartered league could draw its players,” said Stephen D. Keener, president and chief executive officer of Little League Baseball.\nTaiwan would re-join Little League in 2003, their best finish in the LLWS since returning is Runner-Up in 2009.\nLLWS results by country.\nThe following table lists each country's record in the Little League World Series."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured Australia in the 1967-68 season. They played four first-class matches and three other matches between 17 November and 12 December 1967. It was New Zealand's first dedicated tour to Australia since 1925-26. However, no Test matches were played.\nThe team.\nThe manager was Joe Ongley. Bob Cunis had to withdraw from the selected team before the tour owing to a knee injury and was replaced by Collinge. Graham Dowling was unavailable.\nBurgess, Harford, Murray and Thomson were the only players who had not played Test cricket. All four made their Test debuts in the series against India in New Zealand a few weeks later.\nThe tour.\nAs three of the team – Murray, Pollard and Yuile – were opposed to Sunday play, the tour schedule was rearranged slightly to avoid Sundays; the Queensland match was reduced from four days to three.\nThe first match was against South Australia. At the end of the third day, the New Zealanders, needing 188 to win, were 67 for 6, with Dick Motz 12 not out. On the last day Motz hit his way to 94, with 10 fours and six sixes, but the New Zealanders still fell for 163, 25 runs short, Eric Freeman taking 8 for 47. \nThe second match, against Victoria, was drawn, Mark Burgess scoring 98 not out in the first innings, and Paul Sheahan making 161 for Victoria. In the easy victory over a Victorian Country side that followed, Motz hit 76 in 46 minutes, taking four sixes and three fours from one over.\nThe next match, against Queensland, was drawn. The New Zealanders were in a strong position when rain washed out play on the last day: after declaring and setting Queensland 353 to win, they had taken two wickets for 44. In the first innings Pollard scored the New Zealanders' only century of the tour, 125 in four hours; Murray made 98. \nNew South Wales won the last match by 131 runs, led by the speed and swing of David Renneberg and Grahame Corling, who each took eight wickets in the match. Murray, the opening batsman, made 45 and 60.\nMurray was the leading run-scorer, with 351 runs at an average of 43.87. Taylor took the most wickets, 13 at 25.00."

        "text": "The 2015–16 North Florida Ospreys men's basketball team represented the University of North Florida during the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Ospreys were led by seventh-year head coach Matthew Driscoll and played their home games at UNF Arena on the university's campus in Jacksonville, Florida as members of the Atlantic Sun Conference (A-Sun).\nFor the second year in a row, the Ospreys won the A-Sun regular season championship. They finished the season 22–12, 10–4 in A-Sun play. Guard Dallas Moore was named A-Sun Player of the Year, the first such award for a North Florida player. Driscoll and his staff were named A-Sun Coaching Staff of the Year for the second year in a row.\nAs the No.1 seed in the Atlantic Sun tournament, they advanced to the semifinals where they were upset at home by Florida Gulf Coast. As a regular season conference champion who failed to win their conference tournament, the Ospreys received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament. As a No. 7 seed, the Ospreys hosted the No. 2 seed Florida in the first round, where they fell 97–68.\nThe Ospreys made the most three point shots (402) out of all NCAA Division I teams in the 2015–16 season, earning them the nickname \"Birds of Trey\".\nPrevious season.\nThe Ospreys finished the 2014–15 season with a program-best overall record of 23–12, and a 12–2 record in conference play. They won the Atlantic Sun Conference tournament and advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time. As a No. 16 seed in the South Region, they were defeated 81–77 by fellow No. 16 seed Robert Morris in the First Four in Dayton, Ohio.\nPreseason.\nBefore the season, Driscoll agreed to a four-year contract extension to remain the team's head coach through 2022.\nThe Ospreys were picked as preseason favorites to retain their A-Sun Conference title by coaches and media. Multiple players received preseason all-conference honors, including guard/forward Beau Beech who was named A-Sun Preseason Player of the Year.\nSchedule and results.\nNovember.\nThe Ospreys carried their previous season's momentum right into their first game by earning a road upset of Illinois by a score of 93–81. In a game that UNF never trailed, the Ospreys set a program record (at the time) for three-point-shots made with 17. It was the program's second victory over a Big Ten Conference opponent, with the first coming in December 2014 at Purdue. In their home opener, the Ospreys blew out Texas–Rio Grande Valley, 106–84. For the second straight game they connected on 17 three-point-shots, tying the program record. They improved to 2–0 for the first time since the 2005–06 season. It was just the third time UNF has reached 100 points since joining Division I. Guard Dallas Moore recorded his second straight double-double and became UNF's 11th player to score 1,000 career points. On November 18, coach Matthew Driscoll surpassed Matt Kilcullen to become the winningest coach in program history with a 98–69 win over crosstown rival and NAIA member Edward Waters. With the win, UNF started the season 3–0 for the first time since the 1994–95 season when they were members of Division II. Over the next two games, the Ospreys trailed at halftime by only two points at Louisville and one point at Saint Louis, however, they went on to lose those games by margins of 28 and 13 respectively. They won three consecutive games to finish November with a record of 6–2.\nDecember.\nOn December 2, Moore and Beech each scored 31 points (a career high for Beech) in a 108–119 loss at LSU. The Ospreys led 56–48 at halftime, but 43 points by freshman phenom Ben Simmons proved too much for UNF to handle. The Ospreys once again set a program record for three-point-shots made with 19. In their next game, they trailed at Dayton by only three points at halftime, but lost by a margin of 15. On December 12 against Coastal Georgia, the Ospreys scored the most points in program history with a 117–71 victory. In December, North Florida swept a four-game home stand to extend their winning streak at UNF Arena to 14 games, a program record. The Ospreys then lost two in a row at Arkansas and at VCU to close out the month of December.\nJanuary.\nOn January 2, the Ospreys won at Eastern Michigan, 82–77, to finish their non-conference schedule with a record of 11–6. In the game, senior forward Demarcus Daniels set the program record for career blocks with 146. Their 11 wins marked the most non-conference victories in program history. On January 9, the Ospreys defeated crosstown rival Jacksonville for the fifth time in a row in the River City Rumble. On January 16, the Ospreys defeated Kennesaw State, 93–78, despite trailing by 14 points in the first half. In the game, guard Beau Beech scored a career high 33 points, and UNF extended its home winning streak to 17 games. On January 24 in a win at NJIT, the Ospreys made a program record 20 three-point-shots, a record that was broken or tied four times in the 2015–16 season.\nFebruary.\nThe Ospreys had improved to 7–0 in conference play until losing at home to Stetson on February 1. The loss snapped an 18-game home winning streak. The Ospreys lost the following three games, all on the road, to fall into a three-way tie for first place in the A-Sun at 7–4. They snapped their losing streak by defeating NJIT at home, 107–71 on February 18. On February 20, the Ospreys clinched at least a share of the Atlantic Sun regular season title by defeating USC Upstate, 81–78. They secured the regular season championship and No. 1 seed in the Atlantic Sun Tournament with a win at crosstown rival Jacksonville.\nMarch.\nThe Ospreys began their quest to win back-to-back Atlantic Sun Tournament titles by defeating USC Upstate in the quarterfinals, 92–69. However, they were blown-out by 33 points in the semifinals by Florida Gulf Coast. Their 56 points were the fewest they scored in any game this season. Due to renovations at the O'Connell Center, the 7-seed Ospreys hosted the 2-seed Florida Gators in the first round of the 2016 National Invitation Tournament, where they fell 97–68 in front of 6,011 fans at the UNF Arena. \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| Atlantic Sun Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| Atlantic Sun tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| National Invitation tournament\nSource:\nNOTES:"

        "text": "The 2015 Super League Grand Final was the 18th official Grand Final and conclusive and championship-deciding match of the Super League XX season. It was held on Saturday 10 October 2015, at Old Trafford, Manchester, with a 6pm kick-off time. The sellout crowd of 73,512 at Old Trafford set a new Super League Grand Final attendance record, eclipsing the previous record of 72,575 established at the 2006 Super League Grand Final. British indie rock band The Charlatans headlined the pre-match and half-time entertainment.\nThe Leeds Rhinos were crowned champions after defeating the Wigan Warriors by 22-20. This meant that Leeds completed the treble by winning all of the major English domestic trophies - The Challenge Cup, the League Leaders' Shield and the Super League Grand Final.\nBackground.\nRoute to the Final.\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan finished the regular Super League season in second place after beating Castleford 47-12 at the DW Stadium, as Leeds winger Ryan Hall scored a try on the hooter in a 20-16 victory over Huddersfield to claim the 2015 League Leaders' Shield. Wigan then hosted Huddersfield in the Super League play off semi-final and defeated them 32-8 to reach their third consecutive Super League Grand Final.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nLeeds finished the regular Super League season on top of the table to claim the League Leaders' Shield. In the Super League play off semi-final, Leeds hosted St. Helens at Headingley and won 20-13 to reach their first Super League Grand Final since 2012.\nMatch day.\nPre-game.\nThe match was a rematch of the 1998 Super League Grand Final, the first ever, where Wigan won the trophy.\nBefore the match, 7 players of the field were playing their last game for their club. For Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai (Leeds) it was their last game of professional rugby league before retirement. For Matty Bowen it was his last game for Wigan before leaving the club as a free agent. Rugby League legend Kevin Sinfield (Leeds) was also leaving the code to switch to rugby union next year, while Joe Burgess (Wigan) was heading off to the NRL and Larne Patrick (Wigan) would return to the Huddersfield Giants next season after his loan spell would finish. So it was a question in the media as to which team would farewell their players with happy memories, Leeds? Or Wigan?\nMatch details.\nFirst half.\nIn the 4th minute, Wigan played the ball 29 metres out from their own goal-line on the fourth tackle, when they decided to shift the ball using their players that were outnumbering the Leeds right side defence. Two passes behind, the decoy running prop forwards then found Liam Farrell who managed to find a gap, running at Hardaker, and then passed the ball just as soon as Hardaker was about to tackle him. the ball then hit a flying Burgess, who broke out of a desperate dive from a trailing Kallum Watkins, to opening the scoring in the match like they have in their past six matches.\nRight from the next kickoff, Matty Smith dropped the ball 11 metres away from his own team's try line. From the resulting scrum, Leeds would eventually score off a Kevin Sinfield grubber kick, that Danny McGuire delightfully dived on cleanly to score Leeds' first points in the final.\nIn the 28th minute, possibly for some, it was a controversial try, because a long Video Referee decision showed visuals that was difficult to tell if Danny McGuire lost the ball, as it illustrates 'unconvincingly' on some camera angles and lost it sideways 'unconvincingly' on others. However, Video Referee(s) Phil Bentham and Richard Silverwood were initially told that it was a TRY when Ben Thaler sent it upstairs for them to check. There was no problem with Joel Moon's simple run in grounding though. Finally, after 2 minutes and 40 seconds the two video referees couldn't see 'conclusive' evidence to overturn Ben Thaler's initial decision to disallow the T-R-Y, and the TRY was awarded.\nIn the 35th minute, Leeds played the ball on halfway, on the 4th tackle and went on to make a line break out wide after Cuthbertson did what he does best, which is creating second phase play. His offload found Burrow who quickly gave it on to McGuire, who fired a ball over the top out wide to Briscoe, who was in acres of space after Burgess was standing way too far back. He ran it at Burgess and then passed the ball to Watkins, who would then pass the ball back inside, when he realised he was caught behind from a defender. The man running back inside was McGuire who would go over to score his second try of the game, making him the highest scorer of tries in Super Leagues Grand Finals.\nSecond half.\nWigan started this half the better as well as they scored first this time 5 minutes in. The ball was played on the far left hand wing 2 metres out. Burgess passed the ball from dummy half to the five-eighth Williams who was having an off game so far but made amends when he ran at the defensive line stepped one defender and flicked the ball out the back perfectly to O'Loughlin who put up a high bomb to Ryan Hall's wing. Hall caught the ball in mid air but had it stripped by Dom Manfredi before landing on the ground. Manfredi went on to dive over the line for a try, converted by Bowen. 16-12 to Leeds.\nWigan look the fresher and up the tempo. Leeds forwards now start to show tiredness, Walters on.\nOn the 49th minute Wigan played the ball 20 metres out from the Leeds try-line. Matty Smith ran at the defence before passing it behind to Matty Bowen who was slowly tingling his feet and then he performed magic, weaving his way through the Leeds line, creating gaps and breaking tackles which would make him go on to score under the sticks on what the Wigan faithful would hope to be the fairy tale moment for him and his Wigan team in the Grand-Final, converted by Bowen. Wigan hit the front again 16-18. Keinhorst on.\nIn the 61st minute Wigan were awarded a penalty, McIlorum deliberately throws the ball into a crouching offside Watkins - Gamesmanship. 31 metres out and directly in front of the posts, Shaun Wane decides that his team should go for the two-pointer. Matty Bowen converts to continue his 100% record with the boot on the night. Wiganners were now beginning to think \"Bowen for the Harry Sunderland Trophy\".\nIn the 64th minute Leeds played the ball 23 metres out from Wigan's goal-line. It was the last tackle so McGuire hoisted a kick high towards Dom Manfredi. Ryan Hall jumped and knocked it backward to Joel Moon who popped the ball over defender John Bateman to youngster Jimmy Keinhorst who delivers a pass to 20 year old Josh Walters to score what turns out to be the match levelling try 10 metres from the posts, he'll remember that for the rest of his life, Walters off with a hamstring injury. Kevin Sinfield then makes the crucial conversion, extending his record of most points in Super League Grand Finals, to put Leeds back in front with less than 16 minutes still left to play. In the end it proved decisive as Leeds went on to win by 22 points to 20. Peacock finishes his career as a player with a record of most tackles, most carries, most metres, most appearances &amp; most wins in Grand Finals. The play was temporarily halted after 66 minutes when a male streaker ran onto the pitch and was promptly dealt with and ejected.\nPost-match.\nLeeds' victory meant that they completed the treble of winning all of the major English domestic trophies - The Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and the Super League Grand Final. They are the first team to achieve this feat since St Helens in their successful 2006 season.\nIt was the Leeds' trio who were given the fitting farewell with a Grand Final victory.\nDanny McGuire won the Harry Sunderland Trophy.\nWorld Club Series.\nBy winning this match the Rhinos had qualified for the World Club Series Final, to be played on Sunday 21 February 2016 at Headingley Carnegie against the winners of the 2015 NRL Grand Final, the North Queensland Cowboys. Wigan, as the runners up, will play 2015 NRL Grand Final runners up Brisbane Broncos on Saturday 20 February 2016 at the DW Stadium. The third team to enter the World Club Series will see 2014 champions St. Helens take on Sydney Roosters at Langtree Park on Friday 19 February 2016."

        "title": "History of the Ireland national rugby union team",
        "text": "The history of the Ireland national rugby union team began in 1875, when Ireland played its first international match, a 0–7 loss against England. Ireland has competed in the Six Nations (formerly known as the Five Nations, and originally known as the Home Nations) rugby tournament since 1883. Ireland has also competed at the Rugby World Cup every four years since its inception.\nEarly years.\nDublin University was the first organised rugby football club in Ireland, having been founded in 1854. The club was organised by students who had learnt the game while at English public schools. During the third quarter of the nineteenth century, and following the adoption of a set of official rules in 1868, rugby football began to spread quickly throughout Ireland, resulting in the formation of several other clubs which are still in existence, including NIFC (1868); Wanderers (1869); Queen's University (1869); Lansdowne (1873); Dungannon (1873); Co. Carlow (1873); UCC (1874); and Ballinasloe (1875) which amalgamated with Athlone to form Buccaneers.\nIn 1874, the Irish Football Union (reconstituted as the Irish Rugby Football Union after unification with the North of Ireland Union) was formed by Dublin University Football Club, Wanderers, Engineers, Lansdowne Football Club, Bray, Portora, Dungannon RFC and Monaghan. Ireland lost their first test match against England 7–0 at the Oval on 15 February 1875. Both teams fielded 20 players in this match, as was customary in the early years of rugby union; it was not until 1877 that the number of players was reduced from 20 to 15. Ireland's first home game was also against England in the same year held at the Leinster Cricket Club in Rathmines as Lansdowne Road was deemed unsuitable. The first match at Lansdowne Road was held on 11 March 1878, with England beating Ireland by 2 goals and 1 try to nil.\nIt was not until 1881 that Ireland first won a test, beating Scotland at Ormeau in Belfast. Ireland turned up two men short for their game in Cardiff in 1884 and had to borrow two Welsh players. The first victory Ireland had at Lansdowne Road took place on 5 February 1887. It was also their first win over England, by two goals to nil. On the third of March 1888, Ireland recorded their first win over Wales with a goal, a try and a drop goal to nil.\nIn 1894, Ireland followed the Welsh model of using seven backs instead of six for the first time. After victory over England at Blackheath, Ireland won back-to-back matches for the first time when recording their first win over Scotland on 24 February 1894. Ireland went on to beat Wales in Belfast and win the Triple Crown for the first time.\nIn the 1890s, Rugby was primarily a game for the Protestant middle class, the only Catholic in Edmund Forrest's 1894 team was Thomas Crean. Of the eighteen players used in the three games, thirteen were from three Dublin clubs – Wanderers, Dublin University and Bective Rangers – and the remaining five were from Ulster. They went on to win the Home international championship twice more before the old century was out (1896 and 1899), so that by 1901 all four of the Home Unions had tasted success at a game that was growing in popularity with players and spectators.\nEarly 20th century: 1901–45.\nSuch was the level of interest in the visit of the first All Blacks team to Dublin in November 1905 that the IRFU made the match the first all-ticket rugby international in history. Ireland played only seven forwards, copying the then New Zealand method of playing a \"rover\". The game ended New Zealand 15 Ireland 0.\nOn 20 March 1909, Ireland played France for the first time, beating them 19–8. This was Ireland's biggest victory in international rugby at that time, their highest points tally and a record five tries. 30 November 1912 was the first time the Springboks met Ireland at Lansdowne Road, the 1906 tour game having been played at Ravenhill. Ireland with seven new caps were overwhelmed by a record margin of 38–0, still a record loss to South Africa who scored 10 tries. In 1926, Ireland went into their final Five Nations match unbeaten and with the Grand Slam at stake lost to Wales in Swansea. Ireland again came close to a grand slam in 1927 when their sole loss was an 8–6 defeat by England.\nPost-war: 1945–59.\nIn 1948, inspired by tactician and fly-half Jack Kyle, Ireland beat France in Paris, England at Twickenham and a 6–0 win over Scotland at Lansdowne Road. They clinched their first Grand Slam in the Five Nations with a win against Wales at Ravenhill, Belfast. Ireland were champions and Triple Crown winners again in 1949.\nThe Irish used only 19 players in clinching the 1949 Championship and Triple Crown, only the fourth time that the Triple Crown had been retained.\nIn 1951, Ireland were once more crowned outright Five Nations champions and were unbeaten going into their final game. They failed to win the Grand Slam or Triple Crown following a 3–3 draw with Wales in Cardiff.\nThe year of 1952 saw only Ireland's second overseas tour, the first for over half a century – as they headed to Argentina for a nine-match trip which included two Test matches. Ireland won six, drew two and lost one of the matches, their Test record being won one, drawn one.\nOn 27 February 1954, Ireland were due to play Scotland at Ravenhill in Belfast. The new Irish captain, Jim McCarthy, told IRFU president Sarsfield Hogan that the eleven Republic-based players would not stand for \"God Save the Queen\" alongside the Scottish team. It was agreed that an abbreviated anthem, known in Ulster as \"the Salute\", would be played that afternoon and that the Irish team would never play again at Ravenhill. Ireland went on to beat Scotland 6–0 but did not play in Northern Ireland again until 2007.\nOn 18 January 1958, Ireland beat Australia 9–6 in Dublin, this was the first time a major touring team had been defeated.\nLater 20th century: 1960–94.\nIreland managed just three victories in the Five Nations Championship; against England in 1961, Wales in 1963 and England again in 1964. There were also draws against England and Wales at Lansdowne Road to the end of 1964.\n1965 saw an improvement as Ireland drew with France before beating England and Scotland, only for their Triple Crown hopes disappear against Wales in Cardiff. On 10 April 1965 Ireland recorded their first ever win over South Africa. The match, held at Lansdowne Road, was heading for a draw with the score at six points each, when Tom Kiernan won the match for Ireland with a late penalty. Ireland beat Australia again in Dublin in 1967 and became the first of the home nations to win in the Southern Hemisphere when they beat Australia in Sydney in May 1967.\nOn 26 October 1968, Ireland made it four successive wins over the Wallabies with a 16–3 win at Lansdowne Road.\nIn 1969, Ireland claimed a 17–9 victory over France at Lansdowne Road in the Five Nations, a first victory over Les Bleus in 11 years. They were again unbeaten going into their final game in Cardiff but Wales denied them a Grand Slam for the third time. In the autumn of 1969, the Irish Rugby Football Union decided to appoint a coach for the national team for the first time, the role went to Ronnie Dawson.\nThe 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed when Scotland and then Wales refused to play in Ireland following threatening letters to players, purportedly from the IRA. The championship remained unresolved with Wales and Ireland unbeaten. In 1973, despite similar threats, England fulfilled their fixture and were given a standing ovation that lasted for five minutes. Ireland won 18–9 and at the after-match dinner the England captain, John Pullin famously remarked \"We might not be very good but at least we turn up\". Ireland came close to a first win over the All Blacks on 20 January 1973 but with the score at 10–10 an Irish conversion attempt was pushed wide by a gust of wind. In the final match of the 1974 season, Ireland won their first Five Nations Championship since 1951.\nRoly Meates was national coach from 1975 to 1977 and Noel Murphy from 1977 to 1980. Willie John McBride was coach until 1984.\nIn 1982 Ireland came close to winning a Grand Slam but were beaten by France in Paris. They beat Scotland, Wales and England to win the championship and their first Triple Crown in 33 years.\nThree years after their last Triple Crown win, Ireland, coached by Mick Doyle, came out in 1985 and won the Championship and the Triple Crown again. They beat Scotland and Wales. The French again prevented Ireland from claiming a Grand Slam after a 15–15 draw in Dublin. Ireland played England at Lansdowne Road and won the championship with a last minute drop goal from Michael Kiernan. The match ended 13–10 to Ireland. It was Ireland's last silverware until 2004.\nIreland were whitewashed in the 1986 Five Nations Championship but on 1 November 1986, Ireland made history when they scored 10 tries against Romania in a 60–0 win. It was the biggest win in international rugby at the time, equalling the French record set in 1967.\nAt the inaugural World Cup in 1987, two straightforward victories over Tonga and Canada were enough to see Ireland through to the quarter-finals, when they travelled to Sydney to face the joint hosts Australia, only to be beaten 33–15.\nIn the Five Nations, England and France were dominant throughout the decade, resulting in the others scrapping around for the odd Championship title. Ireland didn't manage to win the trophy once in the whole decade and worse never finished outside the bottom two. In 1991, they lost their test series against Namibia.\nThe second Rugby World Cup took place in Britain, Ireland and France in 1991. Ireland found themselves in the same pool as Scotland. After two easy wins over Japan and Zimbabwe, Scotland sneaked a 24–15 win at Murrayfield. Ireland played the Wallabies at Lansdowne Road in the quarter-final and appeared to be on the verge of a shock victory over Australia, when Michael Lynagh scored the winning try to clinch a 19–18 win for Australia.\nAt the 1994 Five Nations Championship, Ireland beat Will Carling's all-conquering England at Twickenham.\nProfessional era begins: 1995–2005.\nAt the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, Ireland were in a group containing the All Blacks and Wales. In a close game in Johannesburg, Ireland went through 24–23 against Wales to make their third consecutive quarter-final appearance. Unfortunately, France proved too strong, with Ireland going down 36–12.\nThe start of the professional era was disappointing for Ireland who finished bottom in the Five Nations Championship three years in succession (1996, 1997 and 1998) and lost to Italy thrice, at home (29-37) and abroad (22-12 and 37-22). Englishman Brian Ashton was head coach between 1997 and 1998, but after a series of disappointing results resigned barely 12 months into the six-year contract he had been awarded by the IRFU.\nWarren Gatland took over as coach in 1998, but was unable to produce immediate success and 1999 was the first time Ireland failed to reach the last eight at a Rugby World Cup. The 1999 World Cup was staged in Wales though Ireland played all their pool games in Dublin. A defeat by the Wallabies in pool play meant Ireland having to go down the play-off route. Playing away from Lansdowne Road for the first time in the competition, Ireland were beaten 28–24 by Argentina in Lens. Statistically speaking, the 1990s was the worst decade in Irish Rugby, with the team achieving only 24 victories in 80 matches, with 10 of those wins coming against non-tier 1 sides.\nFrom this nadir, however, Irish rugby improved rapidly. With the advent of professionalism, the Irish Rugby Football Union decided to convert the four representative provincial sides into \"de facto\" club sides, with the financial capacity to retain top talent in Ireland, yet retaining strong links with amateur clubs and schools to enable young talent to be brought up through the ranks. The close geographical proximity of most of the Irish international squad helped cement relationships between the players. The later formation in 2001 of the Celtic League (now called the Pro14) cemented this strategy by ensuring that provincial sides had a regular schedule of competitive rugby.\nThe advent of the new Six Nations format coincided with this Irish resurgence, and they became the strongest of the Celtic nations. In 2001 the rugby union season was disrupted due to the foot and mouth crisis in Britain. Ireland were good enough to beat France but were unable to play Scotland until the Autumn and were caught cold losing 32–10. They were still good enough to beat England, spoiling their hopes of a Grand Slam, and finishing second on points difference. Eddie O'Sullivan took over as coach from Warren Gatland in November 2001 following the New Zealander's sacking. Gatland's win percentage of 47.4% made him the most successful Irish coach since Ronnie Dawson in the early 1970s.\nThe 2003 Six Nations Championship came down to the wire with Ireland and England playing a Grand Slam decider at Lansdowne Road. England, however, won 42–6. That defeat ended an unbeaten run that stretched back 10 Tests to their Rugby World Cup qualifiers warm up against Romania in September 2002 and included defeats of Pool A rivals Australia and Argentina at Lansdowne Road. In 2004 they lost their opening game against France but became the first team to beat England following their World Cup win. They finished second in the table behind France and won the Triple Crown.\nIn 2005 Ireland were considered slight favourites entering the Six Nations Championships, and won their first three matches, including a 19–13 defeat of England in Dublin. However, Ireland's dreams of their first Grand Slam since 1948 were ended with a 26–19 home loss to France. In the final round, Wales defeated Ireland 32–20 at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to win the Grand Slam. Ireland finished in 3rd place.\n2006–2009.\nIn 2006, Ireland showed the capacity to play top class rugby, but only inconsistently – a rout of Wales was balanced by uncertain victories against England, Scotland and Italy and a comprehensive defeat by winners France. Ireland finished second and won the Triple Crown for the second time in three years, incidentally the first ever time a trophy had been awarded for the feat.\nThey then embarked on their annual tour to the southern hemisphere. There they ran New Zealand close twice before a tired Ireland were thumped by the Wallabies in Perth.\nIn the last Autumn Internationals at Lansdowne Road, Ireland beast he South African experimental side 32–15. Next were Australia, with Ireland posting a 21–6 victory to propel Ireland to a best ever height of 3rd in the IRB World Rankings. In the final international match at Lansdowne, Ireland thumped the Pacific Islanders 61–17.\nIn March 2007, the IRFU created the \"High Performance Select Group\" of up and coming Irish players who have been earmarked for future Irish teams. This group included Luke Fitzgerald, Tommy Bowe, Rob Kearney, Stephen Ferris, and Jamie Heaslip. The aim of the group is to provide young players with support and infrastructure and to ease their future transition into the Irish team.\nWith the announcement of the rebuilding of Lansdowne Road, a new venue was required to stage Ireland's home internationals. The only stadium in Ireland capable of holding major rugby internationals was Croke Park, home of the Gaelic Athletic Association. To accommodate this, the GAA temporarily relaxed its rule governing the playing of so-called \"foreign games\" on its property. Initially, two Six Nations games were played at Croke Park during 2007; the first was a 17–20 loss to France, and the second a 43 to 13 win over England.\nIreland began their 2008 Six Nations Campaign with a narrow win over Italy. France then edged Ireland out in Paris, before they went on to beat Scotland in Dublin, Ireland then lost to eventual Grand Slammers Wales and England.\nIn March 2008, Eddie O'Sullivan resigned as Ireland coach after the disappointing Six Nations and World Cup campaigns.\nDeclan Kidney was subsequently appointed as manager but did not take up this role formally until after Ireland's tour of New Zealand and Australia (losing to the All Blacks 21–11 and Australia 18–12). His first official game in charge was against Canada at Thomond Park which Ireland won 55–0.\nIreland won the 2009 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam by beating Wales at the Millennium Stadium 15–17 on 21 March 2009, the decisive score coming from a dropped goal by Ronan O'Gara. It was the first time they had won the championship since 1985, and the first time they had won the Grand Slam since 1948. Ireland also became only the second team (after Wales in 2005) to win a Six Nations Grand Slam after playing more away games than at home.\nThe Ireland team arrived home at Dublin Airport to a heroes welcome. Afterwards around 18,000 fans turned out at the Mansion House to greet the team after clinching their Grand Slam.\nAfter Autumn Series victories against Fiji and South Africa, and a draw against Australia, Ireland ended 2009 unbeaten.\n2010–2013.\nIreland began the 2010 Six Nations with a home game against Italy, winning 29–11. Their second game was away to France with Ireland losing 33–10. Next Ireland were away to England. Ireland emerged victorious, a Tommy Bowe try and Ronan O'Gara conversion winning the match 16–20. Next Ireland were back at Croke Park against Wales. Ireland were winners, beating Wales 27–12 after a Man-of-the-Match performance from Tomás O'Leary. Ireland's final game of the Six Nations, and the last ever game at Croke Park, was against Scotland. Ireland went into the match with a 5th Triple Crown in sight, but lost to Scotland 20–23.\nIreland began their 2010 Summer Tests with a non-cap friendly against the Barbarians, which they lost 23–29. Their next game saw them take on New Zealand. Following an Jamie Heaslip red card with 15 minutes played, Ireland were thrashed 66–28, their heaviest ever defeat at the time. Ireland's next game was against New Zealand Maori. The side fielded many inexperienced players. The game was level at 18–18 at half-time, but the Maori won 31–28. Ireland's last game of the Summer Tests, was against Australia which they lost 22–15.\nIreland began their 2010 Autumn Tests with a 21–23 defeat by South Africa, the first international at the new Aviva Stadium. Ronan O'Gara won his 100th cap for Ireland during the game. Ireland's next game was against Samoa, which they won 20–10. Ireland's third game of the 2010 Autumn Tests was against New Zealand, which the All-Blacks won 18–38. Ireland's final game of the 2010 Autumn Tests was against Argentina, which Ireland won 29–9.\nThe 2011 Six Nations Championship began for Ireland against Italy in Rome, where a late Ronan O'Gara drop goal secured an 11–13 win for Ireland. Ireland lost 22–25 to France in their second match, the first Six Nations match to be played at the Aviva Stadium. Ireland next played Scotland at Murrayfield, defeating the Scots 18–21. Wales defeated Ireland 19–13 at the Millennium Stadium. During the game, Ronan O'Gara became the first Irishman, and only the fifth player, to cross the 1,000-point barrier in international rugby, and Brian O'Driscoll equalled the Four/Five/Six Nations all-time record for tries scored. Ireland's final game was against England, who were chasing their first Grand Slam in eight years. Ireland won 24–8 to ruin England's hopes, Brian O'Driscoll scored his 25th Championship try to set a new record, and Ronan O'Gara made his 56th Championship appearance to equal the record of countryman Mike Gibson.\nIreland's 2012 Six Nations Championship campaign began with 21–23 defeat at the hands of Wales. Ireland's second game, away to France, was called off due to a frozen pitch. Ireland beat Italy 42–10 in their second fixture of the 2012 Six Nations. Ireland's third game was the re-arranged fixture against France at the Stade de France, which was drawn 17–17. Ireland beat Scotland 32–14 in their Round 4 game. Ireland's final 2012 Six Nations game was away to England, which the hosts won 30–9, meaning Ireland finished third overall with two wins, one draw and two defeats.\nIreland began their three-test 2012 summer tour of New Zealand with a 42–10 defeat. Ireland narrowly lost the second test after a 79th minute Dan Carter drop-goal secured a 22–19 win for New Zealand. New Zealand won the third test 60–0, securing a 3–0 series victory and inflicting upon Ireland their heaviest ever defeat.\nIreland opened their 2012 November tests with a 12–16 defeat at the hands of South Africa. Ireland's second game of the series was an uncapped friendly against Fiji, which the Irish XV won 53–0. Ireland beat Argentina 46–24 in the third and final 2012 November test, securing a place in the IRB Rankings top 8.\nThe 2013 Six Nations Championship began for Ireland with a trip to Wales, where Ireland won 22–30, their first win against Wales since 2010. Ireland lost their second game, at home to England, 6-12, the first time they have lost at home to England in 10 years. Scotland beat Ireland 12–8 in Round 3 of the tournament. Ireland drew 13–13 with France in Round 4, the second consecutive draw between the sides. Ireland went into their final game of the tournament, against Italy. Italy won the game 22–15, their first win over Ireland in the Six Nations, but France ended up with the Wooden Spoon because Ireland had a better points-difference.\nThe IRFU decided not to extend Declan Kidney's contract in the wake of the defeat, meaning Les Kiss would take over as Interim head coach for the North America Tour in June 2013.\nJoe Schmidt Era (2013–2019).\nLeinster's Joe Schmidt was announced as the new permanent Ireland team coach on 29 April 2013. His contract started on 1 July 2013, after Ireland's tour of North America, which was led by Les Kiss. Ireland went to North America for their 2013 Summer Tour, beating the USA 12–15 on 8 June 2013 before beating Canada 14–40 on 15 June 2013. \nIreland opened their 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests with a 40–9 win against Samoa. Ireland lost 15–32 to Australia in the second game of the series on 16 November 2013. Ireland lost 22–24 to New Zealand in their final game of 2013 on 24 November 2013, having led almost throughout the match only to be denied by a late converted try.\nIreland opened their 2014 Six Nations Championship with a 28–6 win over Scotland on 2 February 2014. In their second game, Ireland beat Wales 26–3. Ireland lost 10–13 to England on 22 February 2014. Ireland won their next match against Italy 46–7. Ireland beat France 22–20 in the final round to claim the Six Nations title on points difference. In June 2014 they won over Argentina 29–17 at Resistencia and 23–17 at Tucumán. In November they defeated Georgia 49–7, South Africa 29–15 and Australia 26–23 in Dublin to move to third in the World Rugby Rankings.\nOn 1 March 2015, Ireland won their tenth test match in a row after a 19–9 win against England in the 2015 Six Nations Championship, equalling an Irish record set in 2003. Despite a 23–16 loss to Wales at the Millennium Stadium, Ireland retained the Six Nations Championship on 21 March 2015 with a 10–40 win over Scotland. In the first match of the final round, Wales thrashed Italy 20–61, putting the Welsh on top of the table by points difference with 53, which meant that Ireland had to win by at least 20 points to retain the Championship. Their 30-point win put them top of the standings, leaving England's only chance of snatching the title to beat France by 26 points. However, they fell six points short, and Ireland became Six Nations Champions for the second year running on points difference. In late May Ireland lost to Barbarian F.C. by one point at Limerick. \nIreland opened their 2015 Rugby World Cup campaign on 19 September with a 50–7 win against Canada, and followed that up a week later with a 44–10 win against Romania at Wembley Stadium. In their third match of the World Cup they faced Italy, and won the game 16–9 to book their place in the quarter-finals. In their final match of the World Cup pool stage they faced France, and won the game 24–9 to top pool D.\nOn 18 October 2015, Ireland lost by 43–20 to Argentina in the Quarter-finals.\nEntering the 2016 Six Nations competition with a squad depleted by injury, Ireland won only two matches in the tournament (58–15 against Italy in Round 4, and 35–25 against Scotland in Round 5), and only achieved a 16–16 draw against Wales. The team went on to win the first of their three-match tour of South Africa 26–20, before losing the second and third tests 26–32 and 13–19. In autumn of the same year, Ireland defeated the New Zealand All Blacks for the first time ever on 5 November 2016 in Chicago by 40–29. This was New Zealand's only loss all year, and ended their record-breaking win streak of 18 test matches. Despite New Zealand winning the return fixture in Dublin the following week 21–9, Ireland moved up to fourth in the world rankings.\nIreland placed second in the 2017 Six Nations Championship, behind defending champions England, who the Irish defeated in the final of round of the competition by 13–9, ending England's record-equalling run of 18 victories since 2015. However, they lost to Scotland 22–27 in Round 1 and Wales 9–22 in Round 4 during the same tournament. With many first-choice players selected to tour with the British &amp; Irish Lions, Ireland took a development squad into their summer games that year, which included a 55–19 win over the USA, and a 2–0 test series victory against Japan. In November 2017, Ireland moved to third in the world rankings following their biggest-ever win over South Africa, 38–3, and victories over Fiji and Argentina.\nAfter winning the 2018 Six Nations Championship with a Grand Slam, Ireland moved up to second in the world rankings. A 2–1 series win over Australia in summer that year was followed by a second victory in two years against the world number one All Blacks, by 16–9 which cemented Ireland's number two ranking and most accumulated rating points (91.17) in their history. Following their success in the Six Nations, the Australia tour and the autumn internationals, Ireland were named 2018 World Rugby Team of the Year with Joe Schmidt claiming World Rugby Coach of the Year.\nThe 2019 Six Nations started with a defeat to England, by 20–32. After this, they beat Scotland, Italy and France, but the competition concluded with a loss against Grand Slam winners Wales which ended 7–25. The Welsh led the Irish by 25–0 going into overtime, until a last-gasp try from replacement half-back Jordan Larmour. However, Ireland achieved some redress when they defeated Wales back-to-back, home and away, in the 2019 Rugby World Cup warm-up matches and subsequently reached number 1 in the World Rugby Rankings for the first time in their history, which they retained going in to the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe 2019 Rugby World Cup ended in disappointment for the Irish, who opened their campaign with a rousing 27–3 win over Scotland, but were felled the following round in a shock 12–19 defeat to tournament hosts Japan. Ireland overcame their other pool opponents Russia (35–0) and Samoa (47–5) to reach the quarter-finals, but were knocked out by New Zealand 46–14. The loss to the All Blacks represented Ireland´s seventh exit at the quarter-finals of a World Cup, having never reached a semi-final, and saw their place in the world rankings fall from 1st going into the tournament to 5th by its conclusion.\nAndy Farrell Era (2020–present).\n2020 saw Ireland´s first Six Nations campaign under former defense coach Andy Farrell, who replaced Joe Schmidt after the World Cup, interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the disruption, Ireland notched wins against Scotland (19–12) and Wales (24–14) before losing against England 12–24. Ireland´s fourth round game against Italy was delayed until October that year, with the Irish recording a 50–17 win, going on to a 27–35 defeat against France to finish the truncated tournament in 3rd place. In the subsequent Autumn Nations Cup, Ireland again defeated Wales (32–9) and Scotland (31–16) but were beaten once again by England, 7–18. Their performance in the game against Georgia, although a comfortable win on the scoreboard (23–10) was criticized for a perceived lack of spirit or tactical ingenuity. Ireland finished 2020 with their ranking unchanged, at 5th in the world.\nThe 2021 Six Nations took place again amidst the ongoing pandemic, with spectators still excluded. In this changed environment Ireland would have an indifferent campaign, once again finishing 3rd with wins over Italy (48–10), Scotland (27–24) and England (32–18), after losing their opening two matches to France (13–15) and eventual champions Wales (16–21). Ireland played most of the game against Wales down to 14 men after veteran flanker Peter O'Mahony became the first Irish player to be red carded in a Six Nations match, for a foul on Wynn Jones in the 14th minute. Ireland achieved two victories in the 2021 July tests against Japan (39–31) and the United States (71–10). Ireland finished the season with an 8–2 record, following a clean sweep in the Autumn Nations series, defeating Japan (60–5), New Zealand (29–20) and Argentina (53–7).\nIreland opened their 2022 Six Nations campaign with an emphatic 29–7 victory over Wales, only to lose to France 30–24 the next week at the Stade De France. They then defeated an ill-disciplined Italy in Dublin 57–6 and got their biggest win over England at Twickenham since 1964 (15–32). On the final day of the tournament, Ireland had to win against Scotland and France had to lose against England in order for Ireland to win the Championship. Ireland won the Triple Crown on the final day of the tournament, beating Scotland 26–5 in Dublin, but failed to win the Championship after France beat England 25–13 in Saint-Denis.\nAfter losing the opening test match of the 2022 New Zealand tour, Ireland scored their first victory against the All Blacks on New Zealand soil on 9 July 2022, their fourth win over New Zealand. Three days later, they followed up their historic win with their first victory over the Maori All Blacks in four attempts, beating the side 24–30 in Wellington. On 16 July 2022 Ireland became just the fifth touring side and first in the professional era to achieve a series win in New Zealand, beating the All Blacks 22–32 in Wellington for a 2–1 series victory. Following that victory Ireland officially became the world number one team for the second time in their history.\nIreland followed up their successful New Zealand tour with three wins over South Africa, Fiji and Australia. Their victory over Australia was their 12th successive home win and completed a clean sweep of successes over the southern hemisphere's big three in a calendar year. On 18 March 2023, Ireland won the Grand Slam for the fourth time in a 29–16 victory over England in Dublin. This marked the first time in which Ireland won the Grand Slam in Dublin and the second time in which they won it on Irish soil, with the first occurring Belfast in the 1948 Championship.\nIn September 2023, Ireland opened their 2023 Rugby World Cup campaign with their biggest ever win at a Rugby World Cup beating Romania 82–8. Ireland subsequently won their group matches against eventual champions South Africa 13–8 and against Scotland 36–14 at Stade de France. Despite their group stage success, Ireland still could not overcome the quarter-final hurdle, losing 24–28 to New Zealand. This loss also ended the side's 17 consecutive Test victories, an Irish record.\nIreland's 31–7 victory over Wales in the 2024 Six Nations tied England's record for the most consecutive Six Nations victories at 11 and also extended Ireland's longest run of home wins to 18. Ireland beat Scotland on 16 March 2024, to become back-to-back Six Nations outright champions for only the third time in history, emulating the class of 1949 and 2015."

        "text": "In the sport of cricket, a century is a score of one hundred or more runs by a batter in a single innings. In a women's Twenty20 match, each team plays a single innings, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. A women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) is an international cricket match between two teams, each having WT20I status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's world governing body. The Twenty20 format was originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board for the men's county cricket competition, with the first matches contested on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup. The first women's Twenty20 International match took place on 5 August 2004 when New Zealand defeated England by nine runs at the County Cricket Ground in Hove. This match was held six months before the first men's Twenty20 International, which was contested between Australia and New Zealand in February 2005.\nThe first century in a WT20I match was scored by Deandra Dottin of the West Indies. Dottin posted 112 not out against South Africa in the opening match of the 2010 ICC Women's World Twenty20 at Warner Park in Basseterre. Dottin's innings is the fastest WT20I century (off 38 deliveries), and is the WT20I century with the highest strike rate (248.88). Batting at number six, Dottin's innings is one of two occasions where a WT20I century has been scored by a player batting at number five or lower. The other was when India's Harmanpreet Kaur, who came in at number five, posted 103 against New Zealand during the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20. \nFatuma Kibasu of Tanzania has scored the most WT20I centuries, with three. Dottin, Hayley Matthews of the West Indies, Danni Wyatt of England, Australia's Meg Lanning and Beth Mooney, and Esha Oza of the United Arab Emirates have achieved the feat twice. Both of Wyatt's WT20I centuries were scored in the second innings of the match. The only other instance was when Sri Lanka's Chamari Atapattu made 113 against Australia during the WT20I series in September 2019. Sri Lanka lost the match, and it was one of two occurrences where a team was defeated in spite of a player scoring a century. This match was also one of five occasions where two WT20I centuries were scored in the same match.\nThe highest individual score of 161 not out in WT20Is was achieved by Bahrain's Deepika Rasangika against Saudi Arabia in March 2022. At 38 years and 99 days, she was also the oldest player to score a WT20I century. At the age of 16 years and 233 days, Uganda's Prosscovia Alako became the youngest player to score a WT20I century when she made 116 against Mali at the 2019 Kwibuka Women's T20 Tournament in Rwanda. Australia's Alyssa Healy is the only designated wicket-keeper to have scored a WT20I century. The only woman to have scored back-to-back T20I centuries is Maria Castiñeiras for Argentina against Chile in October 2023.\n, a total of 54 centuries have been scored by 36 different players, from 21 national teams, after over 1,700 WT20I matches."

The ground has hosted 34 Test matches, the first of these was in 1948 between India and the West Indies.&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi / Test matches / Match result list \"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four One Day Internationals (ODIs) have also been played at the ground, the first in 1982 between India and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi / One-Day Internationals matches / Match result list \"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The first bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a Test match at Arun Jaitley Stadium was C. R. Rangachari for India against West Indies in 1948. Anil Kumble became one among only two bowlers in Test history to take ten wickets in an innings, doing so against Pakistan in 1999. His bowling figures of 10 wickets for 75 runs remains the best innings figures at the stadium. As of September 2019, 39 five-wicket hauls have occurred at this ground.\nAs of August 2019, five bowlers have taken ODI five-wicket hauls at the Arun Jaitely Stadium. West Indian Viv Richards was the first to take an ODI five-wicket haul at this ground when he took 6 wickets for 41 runs against India in 1989. Harbhajan Singh was the first Indian to take an ODI five-wicket haul at the ground, doing so against England in 2006.\nNo bowler has taken a five-wicket haul in a T20I match held at the ground."

        "text": "The England cricket team represented England, Scotland and Wales in Test cricket. England played Australia in the first ever Test match, which took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in March 1877. Although four touring parties of English players had visited Australia prior to 1877, the Australian team had not previously been considered strong enough to play on equal terms. The two matches between the English cricketers and the Australians were retrospectively granted Test status.\nBetween 1877 and 1914, when competitive cricket was interrupted by the First World War, England played 123 Test matches, resulting in 59 victories, 22 draws and 42 defeats. For much of this period, England and Australia were the only Test playing countries and played each other every year or two. In 1888–89, England toured South Africa and played two matches subsequently deemed to be Test matches. Subsequently, the sides played each other sporadically and from 1906 fixtures were played as frequently as the Ashes series. In 1912, the three sides competed in a Triangular Tournament, which was deemed a failure, partly due to a damp English summer and in part because of the perceived complexity of the tournament.\nOverall, by 1914, England had played 94 Test matches against Australia and 29 versus South Africa. England won 19 matches by an innings, with their largest victory being by an innings and 230 runs against Australia during the 1891–92 Ashes series, their eighth-best innings win of all time. Their largest victory by runs alone during this period was in 1896 against South Africa, when they won by 288 runs, while they won by 10 wickets on four occasions. England's victories by one wicket during this period are two of the three occasions that England have won by this margin in Test cricket, while their 10-run win over Australia during the 1894–95 Ashes series is their third-narrowest win by runs. In the first match of the 1886–87 Ashes series, England scored their lowest ever innings score in Test cricket, 45 runs. Despite that low score, they won the match by 13 runs."

During this period, England faced India, New Zealand and the West Indies for the first time in Test cricket, having previously only played against Australia and South Africa. The emergence of Don Bradman as an extraordinary batsman for Australia led to England employing Bodyline tactics during the 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia. The tactic, which involved bowling fast deliveries aimed at the batsman, created antagonism between the two teams. The England team of the era featured some of the country's best batsmen; Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond and Len Hutton were all included in the \"ESPNcricinfo\" \"all-time England XI\" in 2009.\nEngland faced Australia most frequently during this period—playing 49 matches against them—followed by South Africa. England won more matches than they lost against every team except Australia, against whom they won 15 matches and lost 22. They did not lose any matches against newcomers India or New Zealand, while against the West Indies they won 8 matches and lost 3. England won 14 matches by an innings, with their largest victory being by an innings and 579 runs against Australia during the 1938 Ashes series, the largest margin of victory by any team in Test cricket. Their largest victory by runs alone during this period was in the 1928–29 Ashes series against Australia, when they won by 675 runs, which is also an all-time record for any team, while they won by ten wickets on two occasions. Conversely, England suffered their largest defeat by runs alone, losing to Australia by 562 runs during the 1934 Ashes series, which ranks behind England's 675 runs victory as the second highest margin of victory by runs."

He has previously played in MLB for the Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants. Alexander played college baseball for Pepperdine University and Sonoma State University. He was selected by the Royals in the sixth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, and made his MLB debut in 2015 with them.\nCareer.\nAmateur career.\nAlexander played Little League Baseball and attended Cardinal Newman High School in Santa Rosa, California, where he was named the North Bay League player of the year as a senior. He set the school records for strikeouts in a season and a career, and led them to the league championship in 2007. \nHe was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 37th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign, and instead attended to play college baseball for the Pepperdine Waves. He was selected to the all-West Coast Conference Freshman team in 2008 when he had a 7–4 win–loss record with a 4.95 earned run average (ERA) and struck out 106 batters. He was 4–5 with a 4.11 ERA as a sophomore, when he was used as both a starter and a reliever. Between his two seasons at Pepperdine he played for the La Crosse Loggers of the Northwoods League. After the 2009 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nDespite describing his time at Pepperdine as a \"great experience,\" he chose to transfer to Sonoma State University for his junior season in order to be closer to home and his ill grandmother. With the Seawolves, he was 3–6 with a 4.50 ERA in 13 starts with 70 strikeouts and was named the fourth-best prospect in NCAA Division II by PGCrosschecker.com.\nKansas City Royals.\nThe Kansas City Royals selected Alexander in the sixth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed with the team on June 11 for a $130,000 signing bonus. He made his professional debut that season with the Idaho Falls Chukars of the Pioneer Baseball League, where he was 1–6 with a 5.73 ERA in 12 games (11 starts). He subsequently missed the entire 2011 season due to left shoulder surgery, and returned in 2012 to pitch in 10 games (six starts) for the Kane County Cougars of the Midwest League where he had a 2.55 ERA.\nAlexander moved between three levels in the Royals farm system in 2013, with five games for the Lexington Legends of the South Atlantic League, 12 for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League, and 24 for the Northwest Arkansas Naturals of the Texas League. Overall, he was 5–1 with a 3.00 ERA and appeared exclusively out of the bullpen. He did not allow a home run all season, and had the second-most innings pitched in the minor leagues (75) without a homer. \nIn 2015 he pitched in 35 games for the Naturals and 11 for the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Pacific Coast League. He finished 2–4 with a 4.52 ERA in 67 innings. He pitched for the Gigantes del Cibao of the Dominican Winter League after the season and then returned to Omaha for 2015, where he was 2–3 with a 2.56 ERA in 63 innings over 41 games. The Royals selected him as their Triple-A Pitcher of the Year.\nAlexander was called up to the majors for the first time on September 1, 2015, and he made his MLB debut the following day against the Detroit Tigers. He pitched a scoreless ninth inning, retiring two batters on groundouts and then striking out Nicholas Castellanos to end the game. He pitched in six innings over four games for the Royals that season, allowing three runs on five hits with three strikeouts.\nIn 2016, he pitched in 22 games for Omaha and 17 for the Royals. In the minors, he was 2–0 with a 3.00 ERA in 30 innings, and in the majors he had a 3.32 ERA in 19 innings. \nHe made seven more appearances in the minors in 2017 but spent most of the year with the Royals, where he was 5–4 with a 2.48 ERA in 69 innings over 58 games. He picked up his first MLB win on July 2 when he pitched two scoreless innings against the Minnesota Twins and his first save on August 22 against the Colorado Rockies.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn January 4, 2018, Alexander was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-team trade that also sent Jake Peters to the Dodgers, Luis Avilán and Joakim Soria to the Chicago White Sox, and Trevor Oaks and Erick Mejia to the Royals. The Dodgers used Alexander as an opener on June 1 due to an injury to Clayton Kershaw. In his first season in L.A, Alexander was 2–1 with three saves as he appeared in 73 games (8th-most in the NL), allowing 27 earned runs in 66 innings for a 3.68 ERA. He appeared in four games in the postseason for the Dodgers, one in the 2018 NLDS, and three in the 2018 World Series, allowing two runs to score on one hit and two walks in 2 innings pitched.\nIn 2019, he pitched in 28 games for the Dodgers, with a 3–2 record and 3.63 ERA in 17.1 innings. Alexander went on the injured list on June 12 as a result of left forearm inflammation, which turned out to be a nerve issue. He underwent season-ending surgery to address the issue in September. Despite the injuries, the Dodgers inked him to a one-year, $875,000, contract following the season, to avoid arbitration. \nAlexander appeared in 13 games for the Dodgers in 2020, and was 2–0 while allowing nine hits and four earned runs for a 2.92 ERA in 12 innings. He was optioned off the active roster on September 2, and spent the remainder of the pandemic-shortened season at the Dodgers alternate training site. \nAlexander had a 2.31 ERA in 13 appearances for the Dodgers in 2021 before he was placed on the 60-day injured list on June 9, with left shoulder inflammation. The Dodgers outrighted him to the minors and removed him from the 40-man roster on November 5. Alexander rejected the outright assignment, and elected free agency.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn May 4, 2022, Alexander signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. In 2022 with three Giants’ minor league teams he was 3–0 with a 0.66 ERA in innings. He was selected to the major league roster on August 26 and was 0–0 with two saves and a 1.04 ERA in innings with one walk over 17 games. In November 2022, he signed a one-year deal with the Giants for $1.15 million.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn February 14, 2024, Alexander signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Athletics. Injured during spring training, Alexander began the 2024 season on the 15-day injured list with a left-rib contusion.\nPersonal life.\nAlexander has Type 1 diabetes, a condition that was diagnosed during the 2016 season. He has three brothers, all of whom played baseball. His older brother, Stu was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 29th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft and played in their minor league system until 2009. His younger brother, Jason, currently pitches for the Milwaukee Brewers."

        "text": "Frederick Roberts (7 April 1882 – 21 July 1956) was a rugby union footballer who played for the New Zealand national team, commonly called the All Blacks. Playing at halfback, he played for the 1905 Original All Blacks, the first New Zealand representative team to tour the British Isles. He was the only halfback taken on the tour, and played in 28 of their 32 matches in the British Isles. New Zealand rugby historian Winston McCarthy wrote of Roberts that he was \"a superb passer, a judicious runner from the scrum, and excellent two-foot kicker and a giant on defence.\" Roberts continued to be selected by the All Blacks until 1910, when he captained the New Zealand team on their tour of Australia.\nOriginal All Blacks.\nHaving represented Wellington since 1901, Roberts was selected for the historic 1905–06 New Zealand team to tour the British Isles. This was the first New Zealand representative side to visit Britain and Ireland, and the team became known as the \"Original All Blacks\". Roberts was the only halfback selected in the squad and this did raise concerns in the press over what would happen if he was injured. However Roberts ended up playing more matches than any other All Black on tour, 30. The side had enormous success, winning 35 of their 36 matches. Their only loss was the famous \"Match of the Century\", a narrow 3–0 defeat to Wales. Roberts played in that Test match, as well as the Tests against England, Ireland and Scotland. He did not play against France, with Billy Stead taking his place. Of their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39, and overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59.\nAfter the British Isles leg of the tour, the team traveled through North America to San Francisco. After playing two matches against British Columbia there, the team returned to New Zealand. Roberts was ill however, and remained in San Francisco for several weeks with Wellington teammate Billy Wallace. After surgery to remove his infected tonsils, Roberts recovered well enough to travel back to New Zealand; only a few weeks after he and Wallace departed, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, destroying the hotel in which they'd been staying.\nLater career.\nRoberts continued to play for both Wellington and New Zealand after the tour. He toured with New Zealand to Australia in 1907, and in 1908 played two Tests against the Anglo-Welsh team in New Zealand. The Anglo-Welsh played three Tests against the All Blacks while on tour, but Roberts missed the second due to injury. The first and third were comfortably won by New Zealand, 32–5 and 29–0.\nRoberts' last appearance for the All Blacks was on their 1910 tour of Australia. He was appointed captain, and appeared in all three Test matches. The New Zealand side was relatively inexperienced, only seven had appeared for New Zealand before, but they won the Test series 2–1 after winning the third Test 28–13. He continued to play provincially for Wellington until 1912, and was involved with his Wellington club Oriental for a number of years. His record of 58 appearances for Wellington was the team's record until overtaken by Ranji Wilson."

        "title": "Common injuries in cricket",
        "text": "The most common injuries in the sport of cricket occur in the lower back, thighs, shoulders, and hands. They can be classified as direct injuries or indirect injuries. Direct injuries are due to impact with the cricket ball, bat, or ground. Indirect injuries occur mostly due to repetitive movement causing overuse of muscles. Fast bowlers have the highest injury prevalence rate followed by batsmen.\nUpper limb injuries.\nShoulder.\nShoulder injuries to cricketers are most often a result of fielding. Overuse of the shoulder when throwing repeatedly during fielding in a cricket game can lead to problems such as tendinitis in the biceps, a tear of the supraspinatus tendon, or even degenerative changes to the rotator cuff which could result in surgery to fix the tear. Impingement, a syndrome that occurs when the rotator cuff muscles are inflamed or irritated, is a major injury risk that can develop amongst bowlers. A 2001–2002 study focused on identifying a workload threshold that would avoid an increased risk of shoulder injuries. The study found that bowlers who produced an average of 123–188 deliveries per week were less likely to face injury whereas bowlers who averaged below 123 deliveries or above 188 deliveries per week were at a greater risk of causing injury.\nElbow.\nInjuries to the elbow are predominantly a result of poor techniques when both batting and bowling. Having a poor technique causes excess strain on the joint resulting in inflammation of the tendons surrounding the elbow. The inflammation can be treated through physiotherapy and rehabilitation to reduce the inflammation and strengthen the imbalance in the forearm.\nHand.\nThe majority of injuries sustained to the hands and wrists of a cricketer are impact injuries from the contact of the ball causing fractures, dislocations, and sprains. Wicket keepers are particularly prone to hand injuries. Injuries to the fingers are the most common regarding the hand. Injured fingers are often splinted and compressed to reduce swelling around the joint. Physiotherapy is essential to ensure the stiffness of the joint does not become too severe so that movement at the joint returns to normal.\nBack injuries.\nThe most common injury location for most cricketers, specifically bowlers, is the back. According to Stretch (1995), 33.3% of schoolboys and 17% of A-grade players suffer from back injuries. A 1984 study in the \"Journal of Human Movement Studies\" compared international bowlers who had a side-on action and those who had a front-on action to determine which was a better option regarding the players back. They concluded that \"an inability to achieve a side-on orientation during the delivery stride was the main cause of back injuries\". One of the most common problems that young bowlers face is pain in the lower back. Performing a bowling action continuously for long periods of time can place excess stress on the lower back muscle tissue, which can then lead to serious stress fractures of the vertebra. These stress fractures can lead to a significant amount of time out of the game.\nLower limb injuries.\nKnee.\nThe most common knee injuries associated with cricket occur when a player is bowling. In the landing stride, bowlers are constantly twisting and putting extreme force through the knee joint, which can result in a strain or even a tear to the collateral ligaments. Patellar tendinopathy frequently occurs in bowlers due to overuse of the tendon, and can lead to the tendon fibres beginning to break down. David Lawrence, an English fast bowler is one particular example of how the landing stride when bowling can cause serious injuries to the knee: on 10 February 1992, his left patella shattered during a delivery.\nFoot and ankle.\nEpidemiological studies looking at the most common injuries that affect fast bowlers found that 11% of injuries involve the foot and the ankle. The majority of the injuries to the feet and ankles of fast bowlers are a result of the impact of the foot planted in the delivery stride. A bowler whose forefoot in their delivery stride is a plantar flex action can cause posterior impingement. After a long duration this plantar flexion can lead to the creation of a bone spur which can then be treated through surgery."

        "text": "The Weber State Wildcats men's tennis team is the men's tennis program that represents Weber State University located in Ogden, Utah. The team competes in the Big Sky Conference of the Division 1 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Wildcats play home tennis matches at the Edman Courts located on the university campus, which supports up to 1000 spectators.\nIn recent years, the team has had great success competing in the Big Sky Conference. The Wildcats have won the regular season championship in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The 'Cats also won the Big Sky tournament championship in 2016, and played in the schools first ever Division 1 NCAA tournament against UCLA in Los Angeles. In 2014, the Wildcats went undefeated (10–0) in Big Sky play and won the regular season championship for the first time in over 20 years. In 2015, the Wildcats went 10–1, and took the regular season championship for the second consecutive year. In 2016, the Wildcats went 10–1 in Conference play, winning their third straight regular season championship, and won the schools first Big Sky tournament championship in over 24 years against the University of Idaho in Sacramento, California at the Big Sky Championships. The Wildcats are coached by Brad Ferreira, who played for the Wildcats from 1986 to 1990, and helped lead the 'Cats to four consecutive Big Sky Championships. Since taking over the program in 2012, Ferreira has compiled a 35–6 Big Sky record, and has brought back three regular season titles to the 'Cats, and a Big Sky tournament championship. With such an impressive three year Big Sky resume, Ferreira was named the 2016 Big Sky Conference tennis coach of the year. Ferreira has recently been named the programs director of tennis for both Weber States men's and women's programs, and has hired Mark Roberts as a full-time assistant. Roberts has coaching experience as an assistant coach of women's programs at UNLV, Southern Methodist University, and UTEP. While coaching at UNLV from 2008 to 2012, Roberts was chosen as the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Mountain Region Assistant Coach of the Year in 2010 and 2012. Roberts played collegiately at Boise State and New Mexico State and earned team MVP as a sophomore playing for Boise State before transferring to New Mexico State.\n2014 season.\nIn the 2014 season, the 'Cats were led by Jakub Gewart, Oliver Good, Todd Fought, Landon Barlow, Caio Poitena, and Sanjay Goswami. Each player had a dominant Big Sky record in helping achieve an undefeated Big Sky record.\n2015 season.\nIn the 2015 season, the 'Cats were led by Jakub Gewart, Todd Fought, Landon Barlow, Sanjay Goswami, Stefan Cooper, and Hou-En Chen. These crop of players helped bring the second consecutive regular season Big Sky championship to Weber State. The team was also awarded as the best athletic team at Weber State for the 2015 season.\n2016 season.\nThe Wildcats returned three Big Sky all-conference selections in Todd Fought, Landon Barlow and Jakub Gewart for the 2016 season. \nThe 2016 season was one for the history books. The 'Cat's won both the regular season championship and the Big Sky Championship match in Sacramento, California against the University of Idaho by a narrow margin of 4–3. The senior trio of Todd Fought, Landon Barlow, and Sanjay Goswami led the 'Cats in securing all three singles wins necessary to clinch the title. The match ended with Sanjay Goswami clinching the win in a three-set battle when the match was tied three-all. With the win, the Wildcats won their first Big Sky Championship since 1992, and were invited for the first time in the program's history to the Division 1 NCAA tennis tournament. The 'Cats played UCLA, the number two ranked team in the country, in the first round of the tournament and lost \n0–4.\nScholarships.\nThe Weber State tennis program is granted up to 4.5 scholarships from the NCAA. These can include up to the following: tuition, student fees, books, and room and board."

        "text": "Rock climbing in Australia originated in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania in the early 1920s, and spread to the rest of Australia after WWII.\nIn 1998 it had a 0.3% participation rate for both genders. It has been featured in magazines like \"Vertical Life\". Competition climbing is managed by Sport Climbing Australia, and has seen a surge in participation since rock climbing's inclusion in the Olympics.\nHistory.\nLike Europe and America, the climbing culture of Australia has its roots in alpinism and exploration. Early European exploration was focused in southeast of New South Wales in the Blue Mountains. There, the seemingly endless sandstone walls and the imagining of the landscape represented in the local newspapers helped to spread interest climbing peaks. Between 1927 and 1938 there were 150 articles, most of which are accompanied by photographs. It became traditional to set peaks on fire after reaching them, to signal success to the rest of the ascensionists' party on the ground.\nLittle is known about rock climbing in Aboriginal Australian culture, but today many mountains are sacred sites.\nThe difficulty of the climbs gradually increased, with some stylistic differences between Queensland and NSW climbers, with the former often climbing free solo and NSW climbers relying heavily on ropes. Some of the early bold ascents include \"Crater Bluff (9)\" by Eric Dark and Dorothy English in 1936, and \"Federation Peak (5)\" in 1949.\nPost-WWII.\nAustralian climbing began pushing into higher grades in the late 1950s with the first grade 17.\nIn the 1960s John Ewbank developed the Ewbank System for grading climbs, the world's first open ended system."

        "title": "Tennis injuries",
        "text": "Muscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis. When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time, bodyweight applies huge amounts of pressure to the lengthened muscle, which can result in the occurrence of muscle strain. Inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle strain occur which resulted in redness, pain and swelling. Overuse is also common in tennis players from all levels. Muscle, cartilage, nerves, bursae, ligaments and tendons may be damaged from overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recover in the most common case among the injury.\nTypes of injuries.\nLateral epicondylitis.\nLateral epicondylitis is an overuse injury that frequently occurs in tennis. It is also known as tennis elbow. This injury categorizes as a tendon injury where it occurs in the forearm muscle called the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB). The injury is regularly developed in recreational players. Experienced players are less likely to develop lateral epicondylitis than the inexperienced players due to poorer technique. Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylalgia is a common injury that occurs in 40-50% of tennis players. It is more prominent at the lower levels of play and usually comes from any incorrect use of the wrist or grip on the forehand or one-handed backhand strokes Players at higher levels often have more relaxed grips and have a larger racquet extension out to the ball after they make contact, where professionals have less emphasis on the arm and more on the use of every part of the body in order exert the natural power behind the ball, lower level players don’t always receive the training on how to use their whole body for a tennis stroke and are often reduced to using their arms in order to exert all of the power, therefore putting heavy strain on the arm. Holding the grip tightly will put more tension on the arm therefore when going for a swing the muscles will be absorbing all of the shock from the initial contact of the ball. Symptoms of tennis elbow includes slow pain, which occurs around the elbow. Simple tasks such as shaking hands or moving the wrist with force, like lifting weights or doing push ups, will worsen the pain Tennis Elbow has actually shown that inflammatory tendons are only part of the early stages or acute stages with a treatment of anti-inflammatory or steroids being appropriate uses for this symptom. Most players respond well to simple rest, but other means of treatment include physical therapy, strength training, and electrical stimulation. Some players will make alterations to their racquet, such as increasing their grip size which will ultimately prevent any unwanted movement of the wrist when extending out and finishing the tennis stroke.\nShoulder.\nShoulder injury is another common type of tennis injury. Shoulder injuries are caused by the repetitive use of shoulder when serving and striking the ball. The injury also relevance to rotator cuff pathology, toscapular dyskinesis or glenohumeral internal rotation deficit which leads to internal impingement and/or labral pathology. There is 24% of the high-level tennis players aged 12–19 suffered from shoulder pain and rise up to 50% for middle-aged players. A way to prevent shoulder injury is to flex and stretch the wrist with an exercise band three to four times a week and to stretch properly before playing a game.\nBack.\nIt is common for tennis players, at all levels of play, to have experienced back injury throughout their career. In fact, more than 85% of the active athletes clarified that they have experienced back pain. According to 148 professional tennis player in one particular study, back pain forced 39% of players to withdraw from the tournament. Furthermore, 29% of the players said they experienced chronic back pain. Lower back pain is another common injury amongst tennis players with instances of postural abnormalities and general overuse which may occur during the back rotation and extension of the serve. In order to relieve pain in the lower back people are often told to rest it, but no longer than two days because of its potential damage to the bones, connecting tissue, and cardiovascular system. Once the back pain has dispersed stretching is recommended in order to prevent the stiffness from the initial pain, with examples being the squatting position or spinal extensions. In order to prevent future lower back injuries strength training to the abdominal muscles is necessary to strengthen the abdomen, and to protect the back from excessive intervertebral disk strain. The straight crunch, the Oblique crunch, and balance exercises with the gym ball are some of the workouts for abdominal strengthening, but the exercises should be done with caution to prevent any further back strain. After the injury is dealt with, players at any level may return to the court, the higher level players will often go through proper stretching before any matches to prevent hurting their back or any other part of their body.\nBlister.\nBlister can be described as a patch that appears on the skin and is filled with a clear fluid and sometimes blood. During physical activities, the continuous force of friction, cutting, squeezing and scratching, which causes the separation of the epidermal cell layer, as a result the blister is formed. Blister (foot) occurs frequently among marathon runners, walk racers, backpackers and in hiking. In tennis, the blister development site often occurs on the hand or around the fingers because the skin is consistently rubbing against the tennis racquet. Blisters can also occur on the backside of the feet due to wearing the wrong sized shoe, worn out shoes, too thin of socks, or improper foot work.\nLeg.\nTennis leg is the most common tennis injury within older tennis players. Tennis leg is an incomplete tear or rupture of the calf muscle. The injury is noticed right away by hearing a popping sound, or a jabbed feeling in the leg. The injury is very painful; players are unable to finish their match if injury occurs. After injury occurs, players should rest, ice, compress, and elevate injury. In most cases, physical therapy is required. Physical therapy lasts from a four to six week period; includes running, stretching, and jumping drills to strengthen the muscle. After recovery, returning to play is slow; prevention includes proper stretching and warmup before play, rolling out muscles, and cross training, such as, Pilates, cycling, or running.\nKnee.\nPatellar tendinopathy is an overuse injury of the patellar tendon. Its more common name is Jumper’s knee. Common injury in tennis players due to constant jarring, jumping, and quick changes of motion while in play. Common symptoms are pain below the knee cap, or an aching pain after playing. Recovery for Jumping knee includes strengthening the thigh muscle, stretching the front and back of the thigh, hamstrings, quadriceps, and coordination training.\nAnother more permanent knee injury is chondromalacia. Unlike jumper’s knee, this injury is unreversible. Symptoms are pain in the front of the kneecap. This condition is due to the gradual breakdown of the cartilage in the knee.\nStress Fractures.\nStress fractures are considered one of the most common injuries in athletes. In tennis, stress fractures are due to repetitive jarring and excessive submaximal loads on bones and muscles. The number one symptom of stress fractures is pain. Symptoms of stress fractures in the feet include tenderness and swelling. Stress fractures are common in hands, feet, shins, and the last five vertebrae of the back. Female tennis players are set at higher risk to stress fractures than males.\nWrist and arm stress fractures can lead to greater issues such as tendonitis."

        "title": "Concussions in rugby union",
        "text": "Concussions in professional rugby union are the most common injury received. Concussion can occur where an individual experiences an impact to the head, and are also notable in high-contact sports, including American football, boxing, MMA and Hockey. Concussions can occur in recreational activities like horse riding, jumping, cycling, and skiing as a result of forceful rotational moment, resulting in injuries to the brain due to the contact with the skull, giving the skull not enough time to move with the body, causing the brain to press against the skull. With the development of equipment and training methods, further education on identifying concussion symptoms, aswell as adjustments to the terms of contact may allow players to make more informed decisions on their conduct on the pitch.\nHistory of concussions.\nA concussion, a subset of traumatic brain injury (TBI), defined as a force comes in contact with the head, neck or face, or fast movement of the head, causes a functional injury to the brain. The severity of any injury depends on the location &amp; strength of the impact. Concussions may result in acute or prolonged impairment of neurological function, the brains ability to process information, which may be resolved in seven to ten days. A loss of consciousness is not a prerequisite for a concussion diagnosis, with blackouts occurring in less than 10% of concussions. Second-impact syndrome is when a player has obtained a second concussion when you either return to field the same day, or return to play before a complete recovery from a previous concussion. This is a result from brain swelling, from vascular congestion and increased intracranial pressure, this can be fatal to a player as it is a very difficult medical injury to control. The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which protects it from light trauma. More severe impacts, or the forces associated with rapid acceleration, may not be absorbed by this cushion. Concussion may be caused by impact forces, in which the head strikes or is struck by something, or impulsive forces, in which the head moves without itself being subject to blunt trauma (for example, when the chest hits something and the head snaps forward). Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or \"CTE\", is an example of the cumulative damage that can occur as the result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to the head. The condition was previously referred to as \"dementia pugilistica\", or \"punch drunk\" syndrome, as it was first noted in boxers. The disease can lead to cognitive and physical handicaps such as parkinsonism, speech and memory problems, slowed mental processing, tremor, depression, and inappropriate behavior. It shares features with Alzheimer's disease.\nIn a 2013 interview, recently retired Scotland international Rory Lamont was critical of the then-current protocols for handling concussions, notably the Pitchside Suspected Concussion Assessment (PSCA) employed at that time::\nConnection with rugby union.\nRugby union has been played since the early 19th century. Being a high contact sport it has the highest announced rates of concussions and outside England also has the highest number of catastrophic injuries out of any team sport. Research finding that during match play, concussion was reported at a higher level, and during training at a lower level, but still at a higher level than most players of another sport to receive. With the game being both physically and mentally demanding, it varies from being at high intensities of sprinting, tackling and rucking, with small intensities of jogging and walking. The position of the forwards consists of them having to have a lot of physical strength to get the ball from the other team, or create gaps for their team to run through. Where as the backs are the players that make the play happen, making runs with the ball, with the protection of the forwards stopping attacks, the backs still do get tackled like any other player on the field, so they have to have physical strength as much as a forward. The Concussion bin was replaced by the head bin in 2012 with the players assessment taking 10 minutes.\nAbout a quarter of rugby players are injured in each season.\nIn the US, college rugby has much higher injury rates than college football. Rugby union has similar injury types to American football but with more common injuries of arms.\nCauses and likelihood of concussion.\nConcussion was the most commonly reported Premiership Rugby match injury in 2015-16 (for the 5th consecutive season), constituting appropriately 25% of all match injuries, and the RFU medical officer said that the tackle is where the overwhelming majority of concussions occur.\nA study found that playing more than 25 matches in the 2015/2016 season meant that sustaining concussion was more likely than not sustaining concussion.\nSigns of concussion.\nSome of the effects that concussion can cause to an individual's mind set can vary, depending on the circumstances and the severity of the impact. The common signs of concussion can be; blank look, slow to get up off of the ground, unsteady on their feet, grabbing their head, confused in where they are or what they are doing, and obviously if they are unconscious. These are the things that a spectator, coach and medical assistant will notice in a player. Sometimes concussion can go unrecognised, so from a players point there can be these symptoms; continual headaches, dizziness, visual problems, feeling of fatigue and drowsiness. These all can occur post game, so a player needs to have knowledge of what these signs could mean.\nSaliva testing.\nAlthough not commonly used at present, novel experimental methods to rapidly diagnose concussion in the field have been developed by research laboratories in the US and UK, based on the detection of RNA biomarkers in saliva.\nTreatment of the injury.\nOnce taken off the field of play due to possible concussion, being unconscious, or showing the symptoms post game, getting medical advice as soon as possible is recommended. At the hospital or medical practice, the player will be under observation, if they are experiencing a headache, mild pain killers will be given. The medical professional will request that no food or drink is to be consumed until advised. They will then assess whether the player needs an x-ray, to check for any possible cervical vertebrae damage, or a computerised axial tomography (CT Scan) to check for any brain or cranium damage. With a mild head injury being sent home to take care and doing activities slower than usual, and maintaining painkillers. If symptoms of concussion do not disappear in the average of seven to ten days, then seek medical advice again as injury could be worse. In post-concussion syndrome, symptoms do not resolve for weeks, months, or years after a concussion, and may occasionally be permanent. About 10% to 20% of people have post concussion syndrome for more than a month.\nControlling concussions.\nIn order to minimise the risk of concussion and repetitive head trauma, the method of the 6 R's is used. Firstly Recognising and Removing a suspected player of concussion, to stop the injury from getting worse. Secondly Refer, whether the player is either recognised or suspected with concussion they must see a medical doctor as soon as possible. 90.8% of players knew they should not continue playing when concussed. 75% of players would continue an important game even if concussed. Of those concussed, 39.1% have tried to influence medical assessment with 78.2% stating it is possible or quite easy to do so. If the player is diagnosed with concussion, they then must Rest, until all signs of concussion are gone. The player must then Recover by just returning to general activities in life, then progressing back to playing. Returning to play, must follow the Graduated Return to Play (GRTP) protocol, by having clearance from a medical professional, and no symptoms of concussion. Despite good knowledge of concussion complications, management players engage in unsafe behaviour with little difference between gender and competition grades. Information regarding symptoms and management should be available to all players, coaches, and parents. On-going education is needed to assist coaches in identifying concussion signs and symptoms. Provision of medical care should be mandatory at every level of competition.\nEffect of concussions on brain functioning in later life.\nA 2017 study found that past participation in rugby or a history of concussion were associated with small to moderate neurocognitive deficits after retirement from competitive sport."

        "text": "William Cunningham (8 July 1874 – 3 September 1927) was a New Zealand rugby union player who represented New Zealand—known as the All Blacks—between 1901 and 1908. Most notably he toured with the Original All Blacks on their 1905–06 tour of the British Isles, France and North America. They were the first New Zealand representative team to visit the British Isles, and of their 32 matches there Cunningham played in 23. He played mainly at lock, and was added to the touring party due to his strong scrummaging ability. He played in three Test matches during the trip: against Scotland, Ireland and France, but did not play in the loss to Wales due to injury, the All Blacks' only defeat on tour.\nBorn near Te Awamutu, Cunningham originally played club rugby in Waihi, in the Coromandel region. Lying within the Auckland Rugby Football Union's boundaries, he was selected to play for Auckland province in 1899 and continued to represent the side until his retirement in 1913. He was first picked for New Zealand in 1901, and played against New South Wales that year, but was not selected again until the 1905 Originals' tour. After the tour he continued to represent New Zealand in both 1907 and 1908. Affiliating to Rongowhakaata, he was a member of the first ever New Zealand Māori team in 1910, and played for them again in 1912. On retirement in 1913 he had appeared for Auckland 45 times, and for New Zealand 39—both large numbers for the time.\nEarly life and family.\nBorn at Rangiaowhia, near Te Awamutu, on 8 July 1874, Cunningham was the son of Hera (Sarah) Ngaihika Halbert and her second husband, James Cunningham. Hera was the daughter of Thomas Halbert, a whaler and trader who landed in Poverty Bay in about 1832, and his fifth wife, Keita Kaikiri, who belonged to the Rongowhakaata iwi. Hera later remarried Paratene Tatae, a cousin of Te Kooti: their daughters included Reremoana Hakiwai, and Keita Kaikiri Paratene, who married Rēweti Kōhere.\nCunningham married Ethel Minnie Dance of Waihi on 23 September 1907. The same year, Ethel gave birth to their son, William Henry Cunningham, however he died at only a day old. This was the only child the couple had.\nEarly career.\nCunningham first played representative rugby union for Auckland province in 1899. He was selected from his club Waihi West (a club in Waihi on the Coromandel Peninsula), which was affiliated to the Goldfield subunion. At the time the Goldfields Rugby Union was a subunion of the Auckland Rugby Football Union, but its constituent clubs are now affiliated to the Thames Valley Rugby Football Union.\nHe was first selected to play for New Zealand in 1901, and played against Wellington and the New South Wales team that was touring New Zealand at the time. Both matches were comfortably won, with the tourists defeated 20–3. Cunningham played his first of four matches for Auckland against international opposition, against the same New South Wales side a week later, with his Auckland team winning 24–3.\nCunningham moved to Auckland in 1902, and played his club rugby for City, before joining Ponsonby the following season. He had been displaced from the national team by this time, with Cantabrian Bernard Fanning preferred at lock. The New Zealanders used a different scrum formation than seen today, and only one lock was ever required.\nDespite not being selected for New Zealand in 1904, Cunningham continued to appear for Auckland, and played in two particularly notable matches that season.\nIn 1904 the first Ranfurly Shield match was played. The shield, a provincial challenge trophy won by defeating the holder, was to become the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their unmatched provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield challenge was played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Cunningham in the side, Auckland lost 6–3. The second notable match that season was against the touring British Isles who were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The Aucklanders defeated the British Isles side 13–0, with Cunningham scoring a try and contributing significantly to the dominance of his team's forwards.\nOriginal All Blacks.\nThe first ever tour of a New Zealand representative team to the British Isles was planned for 1905, and a preliminary tour of Australia and New Zealand was undertaken to help fund the tour. Cunningham was not in the original touring squad, and so played for Auckland against New Zealand. According to Winston McCarthy, New Zealand's forwards were at \"sixes and sevens mainly through want of a good lock.\" Following the conclusion of the preliminary tour of Australia and New Zealand it was clear that a specialist lock forward needed to be added to the side. Fanning, who had kept Cunningham out of the New Zealand side in 1903 and 1904, had retired following the 1904 season and consequently Cunningham did enough to earn selection as the team's only specialist lock.\nThe team departed aboard the \"Rimutaka\" and during the voyage conducted training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by the team's captain, Dave Gallaher, with help from Cunningham. Vice-captain and first five-eighth Billy Stead was in charge of the backs, and consequently the services of the New Zealand Rugby Union-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used.\nAfter a six-week voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8 September 1905. After finally arriving in England, the side opened their tour against Devon. Cunningham played in the match which was won easily by the New Zealanders 55–4. Devon were expected to pose a serious challenge, but were overwhelmed and only managed to score a drop-kick. A series of large victories followed against domestic opposition throughout England, and by the time the All Blacks played their first Test match against Scotland, the team had played and won nineteen matches, and scored 612 points while conceding only 15.\nWhen time for the Scotland Test did arrive, it was discovered that as the ground had not been covered for protection from the elements, and had frozen over. The Scotland Football Union wanted to abandon the match, but Gallaher and the tour manager George Dixon contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw, and the match was eventually allowed to proceed. The Test was closely contested, with Scotland leading 7–6 at half-time, but the All Blacks scored two late tries, including one to Cunningham, to win 12–7; despite the close score-line, the New Zealanders were clearly the better of the two sides.\nCunningham was selected for the Ireland match a week later. The fixture was won 15–0 by New Zealand in front of 12,000 people at Landsdowne Road. The tourists then returned to England, where they defeated England 15–0 at Crystal Palace, but Cunningham was not selected due to injury. He was still injured for the Wales Test, and this may have contributed to New Zealand's defeat. The 3–0 loss, the New Zealander's first of the tour, was narrow and controversial, and according to team manager Dixon, \"New Zealand suffered by the absence from the team of G. W. [George] Smith, W. Cunningham, and J. W. [Billy] Stead.\"\nCunningham recovered to play the team's final Test, against France in Paris, where he played as \"breakaway\" (flanker) rather than his usual position of lock. His last two tour matches were against British Columbia during the American leg of the tour, after which the side returned to New Zealand. The \"Original All Blacks\"—as the team is now known—had played 35 games and lost only once. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles, of which Cunninghham had played 23, New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. The 1905–06 Originals are remembered as perhaps the greatest of All Black sides, and set the standard for all their successors. They introduced a number of innovations to Britain and Ireland, including specialised forward positions and unfamiliar variations in attacking plays.\nLater career.\nCunningham continued to play for Auckland on his return from the Originals' tour. They had regained the Ranfurly Shield in 1905, and he played in a number of shield defences over the subsequent seasons. He was selected for the New Zealand team that toured Australia in 1907 where he played seven matches, including all three Tests against Australia. He was again selected for the All Blacks in 1908, this time to play the touring Anglo-Welsh team, and played in all three Tests. This was his last appearance for New Zealand, which gave him 39 appearances for his national team, including 9 Test matches. He was later selected for the inaugural New Zealand Māori team (now called the Māori All Blacks) on their 1910 tour of Australia, and again for another tour in 1912.\nHe continued to play for Auckland until 1913. This period included two more matches against international opposition: a victory over the 1908 Anglo-Welsh side 11–0, and a defeat of Australia in 1913. Auckland had held the Ranfurly Shield throughout this time, and had endured a number of close shield challenges during their reign. They had 23 successful shield defenses before they faced Taranaki on 16 August 1913. In the match Taranaki scored a converted try (worth five points at the time) four minutes from full-time to end Auckland's shield reign. Cunningham had played in 16 of Auckland's 24 shield matches during their tenure. He retired from provincial rugby at the end of that season.\nPersonal life and playing style.\nCunningham was very physically fit and strong, and was \"remarkably agile\" according to writer Matt Elliott. He was very popular with his teammates and possessed a good sense of humour. Like Billy Stead, the other Māori in the 1905–06 All Black side, Cunningham was able to speak the language. Outside of rugby he spent his early working-life as an axeman, and spent some time as a miner before later working for the Auckland Harbour Board. At the time of his death he was working at an Auckland freezing works.\nDeath and legacy.\nCunningham died suddenly from acute meningitis at Auckland in September 1927, and his funeral was attended by a number of dignitaries, including representatives of the New Zealand, Auckland, New South Wales and Thames Rugby Unions. His pallbearers were all former All Blacks, and included fellow Original All Blacks George Tyler, George Nicholson and George Gillett. After his casket had been lowered into its grave at Hillsborough Cemetery, an Auckland representative jersey was thrown on top.\nSources.\nBooks and newspapers\nWeb"

        "title": "Volleyball injuries",
        "text": "Volleyball is a game played between two opposing sides, with six players on each team, where the players use mainly their hands to hit the ball over a net and try to make the ball land on the opposing team's side of the court. Volleyball is played by over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most popular sports in the world. Volleyball has some risks involved with it because there are some injuries which occur to players that are quite common; these include ankle injuries, shoulder injuries, foot injuries and knee injuries.\nAnkle sprains.\nThe majority of sprained ankles in volleyball occur when a player is at the net, either blocking or spiking. The reason why ankle sprains occur at the net is because both blocking and spiking involve jumping and possibly of landing on an opponent's foot causing the injury. Approximately 50 percent of all sprained ankles in volleyball occur when a blocker lands on the attacking player's foot, while about 25 percent occur when a blocker lands on their own teammate's foot following a block with multiple blockers involved.\nOne possible situation that can cause a player to sprain their ankle is when the ball is set too tight or close to the net. As the ball is too close to the net the player who is attempting to spike the ball has to jump closer to the net meaning that they have a higher possibility of landing on or over the center line on the court. By doing this both the blockers and attacker are at an increased risk of spraining their ankle. There are some simple ways in which ankle sprains can be prevented, which include rule changes, technical training and strapping or bracing the ankle.\nShoulder injuries.\nThere is currently a high number of shoulder injuries in volleyball, and it is still unknown how this number can be managed. Shoulder injuries are great in number because the shoulder is constantly placed under stress during the spiking movements. The stress is caused by the rotation of the arm around the shoulder joint at a high velocity. There are however multiple spiking techniques, including traditional and alternative techniques, that have different risks to the shoulder. The alternative spiking method is said to be a possible prevention to some injuries that occur in the shoulder and also enhance an athlete's performance.\nJumper's knee.\nJumper's knee is injury term used in volleyball circles that describes the injury known as patella tendinopathy, patella tendinosis or patella tendonitis. Jumper's knee is defined as a syndrome of tendon pain, localized tenderness and that is detrimental to an athlete's performance. In the initial phase of the injury the tendons with the knee are usually inflamed. If jumper's knee becomes a chronic injury, which usually occurs as age increases, the tendons show an increasing degree of degeneration and little to no inflation present. As the etiology and pathology of jumper's knee is not known the treatment varies and is largely based on a trial and error basis. \nJumper's knee is said to occur after frequent actions involving quick accelerations and decelerations, eccentric activities and quick cutting actions. As spiking involves jumping, in which a quick acceleration occurs when jumping and quick deceleration when landing, this action is a possible cause of Jumper's knee. Also blocking is a possible cause of Jumper's knee because it to involves jumping and landing quickly. However, Jumper's knee is less common among athletes who compete in beach volleyball rather than those who play indoor volleyball. This is because beach volleyball is played on sand which reduces the impact of landing on the knee.\nPreventative Measures, Treatment, and Other Common Injuries.\nThere are ways to prevent injuries such as stretching, proper hydration, conditioning, and more. Also, knee pads are necessary to help avoid knee injuries and ankle braces are often used as a way to stabilize the ankles when jumping. The most common volleyball associated injuries are found in the ankles, fingers, shoulders, knees, and the back. These include rotator cuff tendonitis, ACL tear, patellar tendonitis, ligament tears or dislocation in fingers, ankle sprains, and low back pain associated with stress or a herniated disk. Treatment for these injuries includes physical therapy, strength training, and occasionally surgery or a brace. If surgery is needed, the time to return to play may vary depending on the severity of the injury. For a torn ACL, recovery to return is anywhere from 6 to 9 months. Often volleyball injuries are due to poor form when blocking and receiving a serve or a hit. Certainly, there are times where the injuries cannot be prevented and are simply accidental. To avoid injuries, conditioning and stretching are very important as well as correctly executing each play."

        "text": "Sam Greene (born 16 August 1994) is an Australian rugby union player. He is a fly-half for Toyota Jido Shokki in the Japanese Top League. He previously played for the Queensland Reds in Super Rugby and for Queensland Country in Australia's National Rugby Championship.\nEarly life and career.\nSam Greene was born in Brisbane. He attended Anglican Church Grammar School until 2009 before moving to the rival Brisbane Grammar School in 2010.\nGreene was a talented athlete in the pool and on the track, breaking school records in each, but shone on the cricket and rugby fields. He represented the BGS First XI and First XV for each of his three years at the school, winning Sportsman of the Year in both 2011 and 2012.\nGreene played understudy to Australian Schoolboys flyhalf Grant Davies in 2010 and 2011, representing the Queensland Schoolboys in 2011 as a fullback.\nIt was not until 2012 that Greene received the opportunity to take the reins of the First XV, going head to head with star flyhalves like The Southport School's Mitch Third (Canberra Vikings NRC 2015), St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace's James Dalgleish (Brisbane City NRC 2015), Brisbane Boys' College's Josh Bowen (Brisbane Bronco's U20s 2014-) and St. Joseph's Nudgee College's Paddy James (Brisbane City NRC).\nGreene's precise kicking from hand and from tee helped Brisbane Grammar win seven from eight matches in the GPS Rugby season, including come-from-behind victories against BBC, Southport and Nudgee. In the final round of the 2012 season Greene helped deliver Brisbane Grammar its first outright Premiership since 1972. Greene would go on to represent the Australia A Schoolboys rugby team in 2012.\nRugby career.\nFollowing the conclusion of high school Greene starred in Wests Rugby's Premier Grade side, amassing 212 points to finish the season as Premier Rugby's leading point-scorer in 2013. He was a finalist for Premier Grade's Player of the Year Award but lost out to Wests team-mate Brett Gillespie. Greene instead won the Colt of Year Award as the best Under-19 Player in Queensland.\nIn 2014 Greene moved to Brothers Old Boys, coached by Brisbane Grammar teachers Anthony Mathison and Carl Marshall to fill the void left by capped-Queensland Reds flyhalf Dallan Murphy. His form for the Reds Under-20s and Brothers throughout the year inspired Brisbane City (rugby team) coach Nick Stiles to select him for a match at Suncorp Stadium. Greene kicked a conversion on debut for Brisbane City, inspiring FoxSports commentator Greg Martin to label him \"the best goal-kicker in Australia at any level\".\nIn 2015 Greene broke Queensland Reds flyhalf Elton Flatley's single-game point-scoring record for Brothers, scoring 33 points against GPS. A few weeks later Greene scored all 23 of Brothers' points against eventual finalists Easts. He finished the 2015 season with 216 points from 15 games, scoring 10 tries and winning the club's Best and Fairest medal in the process, but controversially failed to win the Premier Grade Player of the Year Award, losing to Bond University captain Josh Fuimaono, who had only played half the season.\nGreene made his Queensland Reds debut off the bench against the Melbourne Rebels at Suncorp Stadium in 2015, and signed an Elite Development Squad contract shortly afterwards. He was selected to start at flyhalf Queensland Country (NRC team) in the 2015 National Rugby Championship, reaching 50 career points in just his third start for Country. Greene went on to break the all-time Queensland Country points-scoring record held by Matt Brandon with a week remaining in the competition, finishing with 83 from seven matches.\nHe signed one-year full contract for the 2016 season with the Queensland Reds, where he will compete with Jake McIntyre to fill the void left by Quade Cooper. Greene largely spent the season as McIntyre's understudy and would go on to sign with Toyota Shokki in the Japanese Top League ahead of the 2016–17 season, meanwhile Cooper signed to return from Toulon on a 3-year deal."

        "title": "Arab archery",
        "text": "Arab archery is the traditional style of archery practiced by the Arab peoples of the West Asia and North Africa from ancient to modern times.\nRelease style.\nThe style of Arab archery described in the extant texts is similar to the styles used by Mongol and Turkish archers, drawing with a thumb draw and using a thumb ring to protect the right thumb. however some medieval muslim writers draw some differences between Arab archery and Turkish and Iranian archery stating that the bow of Hejazi Arabs is superior \nArab archery history.\nA Headstone of a Syrian archer was found along Hadrian's Wall, and dates from the 2nd century Common Era, when 200 Syrian archers were sent to reinforce the 8,000 Roman soldiers. The tombstone is now displayed at the .\nArab archers used composite bows from foot, horse, and camel, to good effect from the 7th century.\nArabs used different kinds of arrows, arrow heads, and shafts.\nArchery in Islam.\nProphet Muhammad was quite good with a bow, and appreciated the benefits of archery in sports and warfare. A recurved bow made of bamboo, and ascribed to Muhammad, is held in the Sacred Relics (Topkapı Palace) in the Chamber of the Sacred Relics in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul.\nThere are several comments by Muhammad concerning archery in the Hadith. Umm Salama told of Muhammed coming upon two groups practicing archery, and he praised them.\nMalik ibn Anas spoke about when at the battle of Uhud, the troops left Muhammad behind, where the archer, Talhah, remained behind and protected the Prophet with his shield.\nUqbah ibn Amir relates how Muhammad said that archery shooting was more dear to him than riding.\nThe Prophet owned six bows: az-Zawra’, ar-Rauha’, as-Safra’, al-Bayda’, al-Katum – which was broken during the battle of Battle of Uhud, and was taken by Qatadah bin an-Nu’man – and as-Saddad. The Prophet had a quiver called al-Kafur, and a strap for it made from tanned skin, as well as three silver circular rings, a buckle, and an edge made of silver. According to a medieval Sunni scholar, \"We should mention that Ibn Taymiyyah said that there are no authentic narrations that the Prophet ever wore a strap around his waist.\"\nCamel archers.\nCamels stand higher than horses, and are more resilient in desert warfare. However, camels were often used as transport, and not as a platform for shooting. An account shows an Arab archer dismounting from his camel, and emptying his quiver on the ground before kneeling to shoot.\nCamel archery is also attested by peoples not known to be Arab. The Old Testament shows how Joshua fought the Amalekites at Rephidim, who used camels for their archers. Gideon also fought against the Midianites and their camels during the time of the Judges.\nArab archery today.\nThere are a number of Arab Archery clubs and societies today. Some practice the traditional Arab archery, while others use Western styles of archery in sport competition and hunting. The main organization is FATA, or the \"Fédération Arabe de Tir a L'Arc\" of Lebanon, a member of the World Archery Federation. The Pan Arab Games usually have an archery competition, and the 12th Arab Games in Qatar held in 2011 had 60 archers from nine Arab countries compete."

        "text": "Representing Brentford, now in Greater London and then in Middlesex, the original Brentford Cricket Club was prominent in the 18th century, taking part in matches from 1730 to 1799. According to surviving records, it had no specific venue and is known to have played at Brentford Court Green, Kew Green, Richmond Green and Walworth Common. Brentford teams are recorded, either individually or jointly with other clubs, in at least twelve matches.\nMatches.\nThe earliest known mention of Brentford as a cricket club is a series of three four-a-side single wicket matches in 1730 when Brentford played Edwin Stead's Kent and apparently won.\nThe first mention of Brentford in an eleven-a-side match is when they played Hampton Cricket Club at Moulsey Hurst on Wednesday, 14 July 1731. The result is unknown but a contemporary newspaper announcement, published a day earlier, states that \"above £500 is already laid on their heads, neither side having ever yet been beat\". In 1732, a combined Brentford and Sunbury team lost to London Cricket Club on Walworth Common.\nThere is then a long gap in the sources until a five-a-side single wicket match against Richmond in 1767. The result is unknown. A combined Brentford and Richmond team played Essex in an eleven-a-side match in June 1770. This was on Richmond Green and the result is unknown. In July 1771, there were two matches involving a combined Richmond, Hampton and Brentford team against Chertsey, one of England's strongest clubs at the time. These were played at Laleham Burway and Richmond Green. The results are unknown.\nIn August 1776, there was a match at the Artillery Ground between London and Brentford. The result is unknown but it was one of the last few significant matches both at the Artillery Ground and involving the original London club, the sport's focus having shifted from London to Hambledon. The final known mentions of Brentford's Georgian club occur in June 1799 when the combined Richmond/Brentford team played two matches against Montpelier.\nNoted players.\nKnown to have been associated with the Brentford club are Cook and Shock White. Cook was active in the 1730s and was \"reckoned one of the best bowlers in England\". Shock White, who was more than once referred to as \"Shock White of Brentford\", is known to have been active between 1761 and 1773 at least.\nAfter 1799.\nBrentford Cricket Club is unrecorded after 1799. It may have disbanded in the early part of the 19th century when cricket went into decline due to the impact of the Napoleonic Wars. There is no modern equivalent. The nearest club to Brentford is Kew Cricket Club in neighbouring Kew. This club was established in 1882 through a merger of other local clubs and is currently a member of the Thames Valley Cricket League in the ECB Premier Leagues."

Three seconds behind, Australian rider Michael Matthews and Lithuania's Ramūnas Navardauskas led home a 24-rider group to take the silver and bronze medals respectively.\nCourse.\nAll road races took place on a challenging, technical and inner-city road circuit, in length.

Cyclists took a 180-degree turn at the Jefferson Davis monument and then maneuvered through the Uptown district and Virginia Commonwealth University. Halfway through the circuit, the race headed down into Shockoe Bottom before following the canal and passing Great Shiplock Park, the start of the Virginia Capital Trail. A sharp, off-camber turn at Rocketts Landing brought the riders to the narrow, twisty, cobbled climb up to Libby Hill Park in the historic Church Hill neighborhood. A quick descent, followed by three hard turns led to a climb up 23rd Street. Once atop this steep cobbled hill, riders descended into Shockoe Bottom. This led them to the final climb on Governor Street. At the top, the riders had to take a sharp left turn onto the false-flat finishing straight, to the finish.\nQualification.\nQualification was based on performances on the UCI run tours during 2015. Results from January to the middle of August counted towards the qualification criteria on both the 2015 UCI World Tour and the UCI Continental Circuits across the world, with the rankings being determined upon the release of the numerous tour rankings on August 15, 2015.\nThe following 51 nations qualified.\nThe qualification process became subject to criticism after several nations, including Iran, Turkey and Morocco did not take up their allocation.\nSchedule.\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4).\nFinal classification.\nOf the race's 192 entrants, 110 riders completed the full distance of ."

In the former, Antony Bolsover defeated him 5–3; in the latter, he beat Ryan Day 10–9, Karl Broughton 10–7 and Lee Walker 10–6 before losing 7–10 to Bjorn Haneveer.\nThe following season heralded Butler's best performance in a ranking event; at the 2001 European Open, he beat Noppadon Noppachorn, Neal Foulds, Rod Lawler, Gary Wilkinson, Chris Small and Joe Grech - whitewashing Foulds 5–0 - before himself being beaten 0–5 by Alan McManus in the last 32.\nThe 2002/2003 season was lean for Butler, as he progressed only to the last 64 of one ranking tournament, the 2003 Welsh Open, where he lost 4–5 to Robert Milkins. His highest earning from one event came at the 2003 World Championship, where he defeated Ricky Walden and Munraj Pal, before losing 9–10 to Andy Hicks in the last 80; this brought Butler £5,700.\nAlthough he was ranked 71st, a personal best, for the 2004/2005 season, Butler's form by this time was already declining. He made a break of 116 in losing 2–5 to Joe Jogia in the British Open, but won only two matches - 5–2 over Walker in the Welsh Open, and 5–3 against Brian Salmon in the Malta Cup.\nFollowing his 3–5 defeat to Wilkinson in the 2005 China Open, and his withdrawal from that year's World Championship, Butler finished the season ranked 82nd, dropping off the tour and leaving the competitive game at the age of 31."

The Colt .45s were the first major league team in Houston while the Mets filled the void left when the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers of the NL moved to California after the 1957 season.\nThe expansion was the second part of an initiative that resulted in the addition of four clubs to MLB. The previous year the American League had added the Los Angeles Angels and second incarnation of the Washington Senators.\nBackground.\nFor a 50-year period from 1903 to 1952, MLB's 16-team structure (split into the American and National Leagues) remained intact. No franchises were relocated during this period, and five markets—Boston, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis—had two or more teams. According to authors Andy McCue and Eric Thompson, \"The less financially successful clubs in two-team cities were finding it increasingly difficult to compete\" by the early 1950s. In addition, population changes in the United States were leading to many citizens moving away from the Northeast, where many MLB teams were based, to southern and western locations.\nFrom 1953 to 1955, three franchises were relocated, all of which had been in markets with two or more teams. Prior to the 1958 season, the two New York City teams in the NL, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, moved westward; the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, while San Francisco became the new home of the Giants. New York City sought a replacement NL franchise, and by December 1958 MLB had created an Expansion Committee. Despite the formation of the group, MLB displayed little intention of adding a New York team. The city had beaten MLB to planning for future expansion, with the formation of the Mayor's Committee shortly after the Dodgers and Giants announced their moves; the committee was headed by lawyer William Shea.\nThe relocation of the Dodgers and Giants led to a proposal for a third major league: the Continental League, which would have started by 1961 with franchises in markets MLB had previously ignored. In addition, MLB was facing pressure from the U.S. Congress, which indicated that efforts to prevent future expansion would arouse interest in weakening the sport's exemption from antitrust laws. Congress voted on a bill aimed at repealing the exemption, but it failed. However, MLB moved to expand after a rival league became a possibility. MLB formed an expansion committee, which voted in favor of adding four new teams, two in each league, by 1961–62.\nMLB sought cities that had received interest from the Continental League. Among them were Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The NL announced an expansion as the 1960 World Series was in progress, with new teams in Houston and New York City. Shea had been a supporter of the Continental League concept, and had attracted several investors. A potential Houston team also had numerous partners, many of whom had oil interests. The AL initially showed interest in adding a Houston team, but the investors wanted an NL franchise. MLB granted the two cities franchises on October 17, 1960. Furthermore, the National League season itself was expanded from 154 games (per team) to 162.\nMarkets.\nThe idea of a replacement NL club in New York City was strongly supported by city Mayor Robert Wagner. The city was unable to secure funding for a proposed Flushing Meadows stadium in time for play in 1962, so the Mets played at the Polo Grounds, the previous home of the New York Giants. George Weiss was the president of the team, and seven-time World Series championship-winning manager Casey Stengel was hired to lead the Mets on the field.\nThe Houston Sports Association was formed in 1957 and bought a minor league baseball team four years later. The group was given a controlling interest in Houston's expansion team, which was nicknamed the Colt .45s. It played at Colt Stadium.\nExpansion draft.\nA draft was held on October 10, 1961, to stock the new teams with players from the existing NL clubs. All eight original NL teams were required to make 15 players available to be drafted by the Colt .45s and Mets from their regular rosters. A maximum number of possible selections in the draft was set at 45. The players were divided into three price classes, based on what would be charged to the expansion teams. They could each take 4 \"premium\" players, who cost $125,000 per player, 16 $75,000 players, and 3 $50,000 players; the Mets chose only 2 $50,000 players. A coin toss was held to determine who would receive the first overall pick in the expansion draft; it was won by Houston.\nThe Colt .45s had the first overall pick in the expansion draft and selected San Francisco Giants infielder Eddie Bressoud. The Mets' first selection was another player from the Giants, catcher Hobie Landrith. The Mets' later selections in the draft included Gil Hodges of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Don Zimmer of the Chicago Cubs. The teams alternated choices through the first 36 picks, before the Colt .45s selected Jim Golden and Joey Amalfitano consecutively. Each team then had every other selection until the end of the draft, which came after the Mets picked Lee Walls of the Philadelphia Phillies with the 45th overall choice.\nBoth teams selected five outfielders in the expansion draft. The Colt .45s picked seven infielders, one more than the Mets; New York's three catchers chosen was one more than the two taken by Houston. Seven pitchers were taken by the Mets; the Colt .45s took four.\nPerformance of expansion teams.\nAfter losses in nine straight games to start the 1962 season, the Mets set an MLB record with 120 losses in their 160 games played. The team featured two pitchers who lost at least 20 games and had the lowest batting average in the NL. Despite the repeated setbacks on the field, the Mets proved popular with fans of the previous NL franchises in New York, drawing more than 900,000 fans to the Polo Grounds in 1962. The Mets played one more season at the stadium, before Shea Stadium was built in time for the 1964 season, in which New York drew 1.8 million spectators. By 1969, the Mets had won their first World Series, one of two earned by the franchise. In addition, New York has won five NL pennants and six division titles.\nThe Colt .45s played their first three seasons at Colt Stadium before beginning play at the Astrodome in 1965. The team won its first game, defeating the Chicago Cubs by a score of 11–2. At the end of their first season, the Colt .45s were in eighth place in the NL; the Cubs and Mets were behind them. The franchise did not finish higher than ninth over the next six years, before improving in the following decade. Houston eventually changed their team nickname to the Astros, and won the 2005 NL pennant; in addition, they played in the National League Championship Series three other times. The Astros moved to the American League in the 2013 season. They made their second World Series appearance four years later, winning for the first time. The Astros would win two more AL pennants, in 2019 and 2021, before winning a second World Series title in 2022.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the 1961 expansion that resulted in the addition of the Los Angeles Angels and the second incarnation of the Washington Senators to the AL, the 1962 expansion was part of a series of moves that led to MLB nearly doubling in size to 30 franchises. Four new clubs joined the AL and NL in 1969, in San Diego, Kansas City, Montreal, and Seattle (although the team moved to Milwaukee the following year). Further two-team expansions took place in 1977, 1993, and 1998."

Eight countries qualified for the tournament; five of them did so automatically by virtue of their ranking by the International Ice Hockey Federation, one, South Korea, automatically qualified as hosts, while the two others took part in a qualification tournament. Under a special agreement with the IOC and the IIHF, twelve North Korean players joined the host team to form a united team.

The effort almost worked, as the group ultimately led by Olympic bronze medalist Wang Zhen held the lead until the bell. At almost that moment, returning bronze medalist Miguel Ángel López had finally worked his way back to the lead. The strain of leading showed on Wang's face as Lopez cruised past. Lopez built upon that lead for the final lap and route back into the stadium. Canadian Benjamin Thorne set the Canadian record on his way to the bronze medal in a national record time.\nA deeper story might be in who was not here. After years of the Viktor Chegin drug related cheating scandal, no Russian athlete entered the race, ending their dominance of world podiums. Recent world record setting Yusuke Suzuki also dropped out near the half way mark with a hip injury. Andrés Chocho was making an effort to challenge the leaders late into the race, but instead was invited to leave the course with a red paddle.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nThe race was started at 08:30."

        "text": "Earl Scottie Carreon Thompson (born July 12, 1993) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He is also the team manager for the Perpetual Altas of the Philippines' NCAA.\nEarly life and high school career.\nThompson was born on July 12, 1993, and was named after Scottie Pippen as his father is a big Chicago Bulls fan. Thompson has American roots through his paternal great-grandfather.\nThompson started playing basketball when he was in elementary, but his game took off during his senior year in high school when he played in the Palarong Pambansa (representing Region XI) and was chosen for the Nike Elite Camp. According to him, he had no scholarship offers from top collegiate schools except for Perpetual Help.\nCollege career.\nThompson played college basketball at the University of Perpetual Help System DALTA Altas of the NCAA. In his rookie season, he was the Altas' sixth man, averaging 6.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.9 assists in 18.3 minutes per game. During his MVP year in 2014, he posted an impressive stat line of 26.5 PPG and 10.0 RPG, while leading the Altas to the Final Four. He was also included in the Mythical 5 selection in that same season. Despite dishing off triple-double performances for the Altas, he ended his college career in 2015 after his school bowed out of the Final Four contention.\nIn 2023, Perpetual retired Thompson's jersey #6.\nAmateur career.\nThompson suited up for the Hapee Fresh Fighters in the PBA D-League, where he teamed up with fellow college standouts and future draft batchmates Troy Rosario, Baser Amer, Garvo Lanete and Chris Newsome. Behind his heroics, he helped the Fresh Fighters win its first ever PBA D-League title in 2015.\nProfessional career.\nThompson was drafted fifth overall in the 2015 PBA draft by the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel. In his first game as a pro, he scored 5 points, 3 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 steals in 16 minutes of play in a 78–86 loss over the Purefoods Star Hotshots. Despite the fact that he only practiced with the team for less than a week and with the limited minutes he's given, his stellar play earned him praises from coach Tim Cone. In his third career game back on November 7, 2015, Thompson recorded 8 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in just 14 minutes of playing time in a 93–92 win over the Alaska Aces. On December 5, Thompson almost recorded a triple-double after putting up 9 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists in 102–94 win over the Blackwater Elite. In the semifinals of 2016 PBA Governors' Cup, he registered a triple double performance long after Johnny Abarientos era. He was awarded later the 2016 All-Rookie Team. \nIn 2018 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals, he was awarded the PBA Finals MVP. He eventually won the 2018 PBA Mythical Second Team and PBA Most Improved Player awards.\nIn 2021 PBA Governors' Cup, Thompson won his first PBA Best Player of the Conference Award. In the 2021 PBA Governors' Cup Finals, he won his sixth PBA title and was judged as the Finals MVP for the second time of his career. In June 5, 2022, he was awarded the 2021 PBA Mythical First Team and the 2021 PBA Most Valuable Player.\nIn January 6, 2023, Thompson was awarded with his second Best Player of the Conference award, this time in the 2022–23 PBA Commissioner's Cup. In November 5, 2023, he was included in the 2022–23 PBA Mythical First Team for the second straight season.\nNational team career.\nThompson was part of the 12-man Sinag Pilipinas lineup that competed in the 2015 Southeast Asian Games and 2015 SEABA Championship, both held in Singapore, where they won gold medals in both occasions.\nThompson was included in the 21-man pool for the 2023 FIBA World Cup, where he was eventually included in the final 12-man lineup.\nPBA career statistics.\n\"As of the end of 2022–23 season\"\nPlayer profile.\nThompson is well-known for his offensive mindset and defensive versatility. In college, he accumulated several triple-doubles on account of his all-around capabilities. \nOn offense, his scoring output is not that high, averaging just 9.8 points per game in his career because of his role on the team. However, he focuses on making his teammates better as a facilitator. With his play-making abilities and skills, he averages 5.0 assists per game in his career. \nHe is also highly regarded for his rebounding efforts. At a height of 6'1, he is a great rebounder for his position and size. Thompson credits his prowess to having good positioning. Others credit it to his high energy and hustle. He can outrebound a taller opponent due to his high vertical leap. During the Governor's Cup, he was 2nd in rebounds per game among locals with nearly 10 (behind only the 6'10 June Mar Fajardo). As of the end of the 2022–23 PBA season, he has managed 7.7 rebounds per game. \nWith that, he is often compared to Russell Westbrook of the NBA because of their similar playing style.\nThompson is considered a lockdown defender, especially on the perimeter. He is often asked to guard his opposition over a high volume of minutes. He excels at forcing turnovers against opponents.\nPersonal life.\nThompson founded his own barbershop, the Thompson’s Sports Hair Shop which opened in Digos in October 2016. According to Thompson, he is of partial American descent as his great grandfather is African American.\nIn August 2023, Thompson formally graduated from the University of Perpetual Help System DALTA with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, Major in Marketing Management. He also received the Dr/BGen Antonio Laperal Tamayo Leadership Plaque for Sports and Athletics award."

Knowing that she would be the only Guam athlete, as was the case when she competed in the 2015 World Youth Championships in Athletics weeks before, she said her goal was just to set a personal record. Not having suitable training partners to meet with, Tugade trained largely alone for the race, arriving to her track at 5:30 a.m. on weekdays to prepare before her classes started. After classes ended, Tugade trained with the Guam Central Athletics Club for this race.\nTugade traveled with a larger Oceania team to the Games, sponsored by the Guam Track &amp; Field Association. Though she qualified for both the 100m and 200m in the earlier World Youth Games, her 200m sprint time was \"far from qualifying\" in the senior championships so she decided split the events, doing the 200m at World Youths and saving the 100m for senior Worlds.\nShe finished in sixth place in heat five failing to qualify for the semifinals, her mark of 12.60 seconds placing her 51st overall by time. Though the time was 0.34 seconds off her own and national record, it was only 0.05 seconds off Polara Cobb's previous national record in this event set at the same race four years ago.\nHer decision to run the World Championships rather than the more regional Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea that year was questioned. She decided to run the more competitive senior world championships instead, saying \"It was a late notice and if I wanted to go I would have to raise $2000 on my own.\"\nThough her run was not competitive with other nations, it was her only global senior championship before being recruited for the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland to run track and field. Guam Delegate Madeleine Bordallo said of Tugade following the decision, \"She has made Guam proud in international sports competitions.\""

        "text": "The 2019 Netball World Cup (also known as the 2019 Vitality Netball World Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the 15th edition of the INF Netball World Cup. It was held from 12–21 July 2019 at the Liverpool Arena in Liverpool, England with matches being held on two courts. Host nation England finished their campaign with a bronze medal. New Zealand became 5th time champions after beating Australia in the final and gold medal match.\nSixteen nations contested for the title, which included the top six of the previous tournament which was held in Sydney, Australia. After two group stage rounds, Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa all made it to the semi-finals. In a rematch of the 2015 final, New Zealand would take home their fifth title after defeating Australia by one goal. England finished in third place, after defeating South Africa.\nTrinidad and Tobago's Rhonda John-Davis appeared in her sixth World Cup, a World Cup record.\nOrganisation.\nThe 2019 Netball World Cup was launched in January 2018 at St George's Hall in Liverpool, the host city. Liverpool was selected as the host city for the event in February 2015 by the International Netball Federation.\nVenue.\nAll matches at the event were held at the Liverpool Arena (known for sponsorship reasons as M&amp;S Bank Arena), which has a seating capacity of 11,000. The venue is the centrepiece of the ACC Liverpool sporting and events precinct, allowing the event's other amenities, such as warm-up and administration facilities, to take place within the one location.\nBroadcasters.\nThis is a list of the broadcasters for the tournament in competing countries and regions.\nUmpires.\nSeventeen umpires from seven countries officiated matches at the tournament.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nSixteen teams contested the 2019 title. Five teams automatically qualified by virtue of their high ranking position in the INF World Rankings, and England qualified as the host nation. The remaining ten teams qualified via regional qualification tournaments, with two teams selected from each of the five international netball regions; Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. The five teams (six if England is included) to be granted automatic qualification, in order of seeding were:\nQualification tournaments\nFormat.\nA new format was introduced for the edition. Teams competed in three stages; the Preliminaries Stage One (12–14 July), Preliminaries Stage Two (15–18 July) and the Play-offs and Placings matches (19–21 July).\nPreliminaries Stage One\nThere were four groups (A, B, C and D) of four teams in the first stage, with the top eight teams pre-assigned to their groups and one team from the 9th–12th seeds and one from the 13th–16th seeds drawn randomly into each group. However no more than two teams from the one region can be drawn into the same group. The top three teams from each group progressed to the second preliminaries stage.\nPreliminaries Stage Two\nThe top three teams from Groups A and B formed Group F, and the top three teams from Groups C and D formed Group G. The bottom four finishers from Groups A-D competed against one another in Group E. Where teams in Groups F and G have already played each other in the Preliminaries Stage One (i.e. A1 has already played A2 and A3), these results will carry through to the Preliminaries Stage Two.\nPlay-offs and Placings\nThe teams finishing first and second in Groups F and G went through to the semi-finals, with the top placed team in each group facing the second placed team in the other group. The winners of each semi-final competed for gold in the final, with the losers playing for bronze.\nThe teams finishing third and fourth in Groups F and G competed for final positions fifth to eighth – third in one group plays fourth in the other – with the winners playing off for fifth place and the losers for seventh. The teams that finished fifth in Groups F and G played off for ninth and 10th places. The teams that finished last in Groups F and G played off for 11th and 12th places. The teams that finished first and second in Group E played off for 13th and 14th place and the teams that finish third and fourth in Group E played off for the 15th and 16th places.\nPreliminaries Stage One.\nGroup D.\n(H) Host.\nPreliminaries Stage Two.\nGroup E.\nGroup E contains the four bottom teams from Groups A-D and compete for final placings 13th to 16th.\nGroup F.\nThe top three teams from Groups A and B advance to Group F. All six teams previously played two matches against Group F teams – for example, each team in Group A played the two other Group A teams who advanced to Group F. At the start of Group F the table is initialised to include the results of these two Group A or Group B matches for each team. The former Group A teams play the former Group B teams in three rounds of three matches in Group F.\nTeams finishing first and second in Group F go through to the semi-finals – the top team in Group F plays the second team in Group G and the second team in Group F plays the top team in Group G. The four remaining teams in Group F compete for the final placings from 5th to 12th.\n(Q) Qualified to semi-finals.\nGroup G.\nThe top three teams from Groups C and D advance to Group G. All six teams previously played two matches against Group G teams – for example, each team in Group C played the two other Group C teams who advanced to Group G. At the start of Group G the table is initialised to include the results of these two Group C or Group D matches for each team. The former Group C teams play the former Group D teams in three rounds of three matches in Group G.\nTeams finishing first and second in Group G go through to the semi-finals – the top team in Group G plays the second team in Group F and the second team in Group G plays the top team in Group F. The four remaining teams in Group G compete for the final placings from 5th to 12th.\n(Q) Qualified to semi-finals. (H) Host.\nSemi-finals and medal matches.\nAt the conclusion of qualifying pool play Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand advanced into the semi-finals. It was the first time South Africa had made it to the semi-finals since 1995 when it played in the final after winning its second round group, while Jamaica missed out for the first time since 1995. During pool play Australia had edged New Zealand by one goal to top Group F and England easily beat South Africa to take out Group G. That meant Australia would face South Africa in one semi-final, with England squaring off against New Zealand in the other.\nEngland were favourites in their semi final, being the commonwealth games champions and having gone undefeated for two years against New Zealand. However, New Zealand started stronger, scoring the opening five goals. England came back to take a 24–21 lead at half time. Heading into the final quarter New Zealand were ahead by three goals and managed to hold on for a 47–45 victory.\nAustralia started with a second string side against South Africa in the other semi, resting their captain and leaving some of their stars on the bench. At half time they led 31–23. South Africa fought back to out score Australia in the third quarter and close the gap to just four goals. They continued to push Australia through the last quarter and in the end it required some great defense to close out the game. Australia ended victors with a 55–53 scoreline. \nThe final between Australia and New Zealand was a tense and thrilling match. The opening quarter went back and forth finishing with both teams tied on 10 goals. The second quarter continued in this vein with both teams going tit for tat scoring goals. In the final minute of the quarter New Zealand got on a roll scoring three consecutive times to take a 25–28 lead into the half. They carried this momentum early into the third quarter to extend the lead to seven goals, before Australia fought back to close it to a four-goal advantage by the quarters end. The score leading into the final quarter was 37–41 to New Zealand. Australia pushed hard in the final quarter of the match, but were unable to take the lead. They got within one goal in the final minute, but New Zealand were then able to hold on to possession to close out the match. The final score was 51–52. "

        "title": "10,000 metres at the World Athletics Championships",
        "text": "The 10,000 metres at the World Championships in Athletics has been contested by men since the inaugural edition in 1983 and by women since the subsequent edition in 1987. It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 10,000 metres at the Olympics. The competition format is a straight final with typically between twenty and thirty participants. Before 1999, the event had two qualifying heats leading to a final.\nThe championship records for the event are 26:46.31 minutes for men, set by Kenenisa Bekele in 2009, and 30:04.18 minutes for women, set by Berhane Adere in 2003. The world record has never been broken or equalled at the competition by either men or women, reflecting the lack of pacemaking and athletes' more tactical approach to championship races.\nHaile Gebrselassie is the most successful athlete of the event with four gold medals and also a silver and a bronze, spanning a period from 1993 to 2003. His Ethiopian compatriot Kenenisa Bekele matched his feat of four consecutive titles in 2009. Tirunesh Dibaba is the most successful woman, with three gold medals to her name (2005, 2007, 2013, plus a silver in 2017).\nEthiopia is by far the most successful nation in the discipline, with fifteen gold medals and 33 medals in total. Kenya is comfortably the next most successful with seven gold and 25 medals overall. Great Britain is the only other nation to have won multiple gold medals, with three in the men's and one in the women's division.\nFour winners of the 10,000 m have completed a long-distance double by also winning the 5000 metres at the World Championships in Athletics: Tirunesh Dibaba was the first to do so in 2005, Kenenisa Bekele became the first man to do so in 2009, and Vivian Cheruiyot (2011) and Mo Farah (2013/2015) followed at the subsequent editions. Of these, only Mo Farah has achieved the feat twice, in 2013 and 2015 - either side of which he performed the same feat in consecutive Olympic Games.\nOne athlete, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, has completed a rare 10,000 metres - 1500 metres double, in 2019.\nAge.\nAt 15 years, 153 days, Sally Barsosio won the bronze medal in the women's 10,000 m at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics. This makes her the youngest World Championships medallist in any discipline.\nDoping.\nElvan Abeylegesse of Turkey became the first athlete to be disqualified from the World Championships 10,000 metres for doping. This ban came retrospectively as a 2015 retest of a frozen sample of urine from the 2007 World Championships in Athletics showed the presence of a banned substance. She was stripped of her silver medal.\nNo other competitors have been banned from the event for doping. Outside of the competition, the 2003 women's bronze medallist Sun Yingjie was banned for doping in 2005.\nMedalists.\nMen.\nIn the sixteen editions until 2017, the men's race at the World Championships has been dominated by three men; Ethiopians Haile Gebrselassie and Kenenisa Bekele, and Great Britain's Mo Farah - between them, they have won eleven of the sixteen editions held, won silver twice, and bronze once.\nWomen.\nAlthough no Kenyan or Ethiopian won any of the first four editions of the race, they shared all eleven since, with Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba and Kenya's Vivian Cheruiyot the dominant athletes, with three wins, and two win's respectively, until the West African dominance was interrupted by Dutchwoman Sifan Hassan. The next highest ranked nation, China, won all but one if its medals in the now discredited era of 'Ma's Army', the distance running program run by Ma Junren.\nFinishing times.\nTop ten fastest world championships times"

        "text": "The 2015 Vuelta a España was a three-week Grand Tour cycling race that took place principally in Spain between 22 August and 13 September 2015; two stages also took place partly or wholly in Andorra. The first ten stages took the race from Spain's southern Mediterranean coast to Castellón de la Plana on the eastern coast.\nStage 1 was a team time trial that took place around the Costa del Sol beach resort of Marbella on 22 August. The day before the stage took place, its route was deemed to be dangerous by the race commissaires; the times did not therefore count for the general classification and several teams rode the stage slowly. The second stage was therefore the first whose times counted; it was the first of nine summit finishes in the Vuelta and was won by Esteban Chaves (), who took the leader's red jersey. Stages 3, 4 and 5 were hilly sprint stages, won by Peter Sagan (), Alejandro Valverde () and Caleb Ewan () respectively. Tom Dumoulin () took the red jersey after the fifth stage because of a split in the peloton at the finish line.\nThe race returned to the mountains on stage 6 with a third-category summit finish. This was again won by Chaves, who therefore regained the race lead. He retained this the following day on the first first-category summit finish of the race. This was won by riders from a breakaway; the significant general classification changes were the several seconds won by Fabio Aru () and the time lost by Chris Froome (), the winner of the 2015 Tour de France. Another hilly stage followed: this was won by Jasper Stuyven () from a sprint, despite breaking his scaphoid earlier in the stage. Several other riders crashed during the stage, including Sagan, who was hit by a race motorbike. The ninth stage was the first before the Vuelta's first rest day and was another first-category summit finish. It was won by Dumoulin just ahead of Froome; Dumoulin took back the red jersey.\nAfter a transfer to Andorra and the rest day, the riders took on a very difficult stage at the beginning of the second week. This involved six categorised climbs in just of racing, with very little flat road between them. The stage was won by Mikel Landa (), with his teammate Fabio Aru moving into the race lead and Rodríguez moving into second, with Dumoulin third. Chris Froome (), who had crashed at the very beginning of the stage and ridden the rest of it with a broken foot, withdrew from the race the following morning.\nStage 1.\n22 August 2015 — Puerto Banús to Marbella, (TTT)\nThe first stage was a flat, team time trial along the sea front from Puerto Banús to Marbella. It was scheduled to take place in the evening, with the first team starting at 18:40 and the last team expected to finish at 20:33. Two days before the stage, several riders arrived at the course and raised concerns about safety. Their concerns included the seven changes in road surface, ramps, a section on a rubber mat on the beach and a raised bridge section. Following a meeting between the race organisers, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and the riders' union, it was decided to use the original route but to neutralise the stage for the general classification. The teams would, however, race for stage victory and the times would count for the team classification.\nThe first team to set a time was , who set a time of 8' 40\". This was soon beaten by the next team to start, , who went 22\" quicker. Their lead lasted until the eleventh team to start, , beat them by 7\" to move into the lead. put in a strong ride but were 11\" behind . then moved into the lead by less than a second. then beat this time – again by less than a second. The remaining teams – including , , and – rode carefully and did not attempt to win the stage, as it had no effect on the general classification. BMC therefore won the stage by a narrow margin ahead of ; this was their second team time trial success in successive Grand Tours after a similarly narrow victory over Sky in the Tour de France.\nPeter Velits was the first BMC rider to cross the finish line and was therefore awarded the red jersey as the leader of the race, although all the 198 riders were on the same time. He attributed the team's victory to the tactic of sacrificing several riders who rode very hard at the beginning of the stage, while the remaining riders held on to set the time. Velits had previous success in the Vuelta: he finished on the podium of the 2010 edition. Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) explained after the stage that his team had not attempted to win the stage because it was \"quite dangerous\" and there were \"a lot of vibrations from the different surfaces\", with additional difficulty coming from the time trial bikes.\nStage 2.\n23 August 2015 — Alhaurín de la Torre to Caminito del Rey, \nThe second stage was a route that included the first summit finish of the race. Most of the stage was fairly flat, with only the third-category Alto de Ardales after providing any significant difficulty ( at 4.4%). The finish of the stage, however, was on the third-category Alto de la Mesa. This was at an average of 6.5%, including a section of at almost 9% and shorter sections of 15%. The stage finished near the Caminito del Rey, one of the most famous sights in Málaga.\nThe first crash of the Vuelta came after just of racing: Matteo Pelucchi () was riding at the back of the peloton and crashed on a corner as Movistar rode hard at the front. He suffered abrasions and road rash and was forced to abandon the race. A breakaway escaped approximately later. It was formed of Nelson Oliveira (), Davide Villella (), Walter Pedraza (), Bert-Jan Lindeman (), José Gonçalves () and Matteo Montaguti (). Although the six riders were unable to build a significant lead, they did lead over the first climb of the day; Pedraza won the mountain points at the top of the Vuelta's first climb. At this point, the break's lead was about one minute.\nWith remaining, however, there was a large crash in the peloton, delaying a large number of riders. Vincenzo Nibali and Fabio Aru (both ) were among the riders caught up in the crash. Aru was quickly given a bike and was soon with the main peloton, but Nibali waited a long time before Giuseppe Martinelli provided him with a new bike. Nibali was then forced to make a long chase to return to the peloton. Another Astana rider, Paolo Tiralongo also crashed and was seen after the incident bleeding from his head. After the team lost Pelucchi early in the day, 's David Tanner was also caught in the crash and suffered a broken pelvis.\nOn the climb to the finish, Cyril Gautier () was the first to attack, but was soon caught by Nairo Quintana (Movistar), who was in a group with Nicolas Roche (Sky) and Tom Dumoulin (). After work from his team, Esteban Chaves () attacked and bridged across to the leading three riders. Chaves soon dropped Quintana from the group and, despite an attack from Roche in the final , took the stage victory. This was his first ever Grand Tour stage victory and gave him the leader's jersey. Dumoulin was second on the stage with Roche third. Dan Martin () was fourth, 14\" back, with Joaquim Rodríguez () and Quintana a further 12\" behind. Chris Froome (Sky) and Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) came in together 30\" behind Chaves, with Aru and all the other contenders further behind. As well as taking the overall lead of the race, Chaves also took the lead in the other three classifications (the points classification, the mountains classification and the combination classification).\nAfter the stage, a video emerged of Nibali holding onto his team car as it accelerated away from a group of riders that had been caught up in the crash. The acceleration helped Nibali to rejoin the peloton ahead of the final climb. As a result of the incident, the race jury disqualified Nibali from the race, describing the situation as \"really clear\". One of the team's \"directeurs sportifs\", Alexander Shefer, was also excluded from taking further part in the race. Nibali apologised for the incident after the race, but also expressed his frustration at having been abandoned by his team.\nStage 3.\n24 August 2015 — Mijas to Málaga, \nThe third stage of the race was a mixed, route from Mijas to Málaga. After of flat roads at the start, there was the third-category Alto de Mijas ( at 7%). Following a long descent, there were more flat roads, before the first-category Puerto del León ( at 5.2%). More flat roads followed as the riders approached Málaga along the coast, though there were more small hills in the final . The final kilometres were flat, though there was a tight turn with just over to the finish line.\nA breakaway was formed early into the day, without significant chasing. It included eight riders: Natnael Berhane (MTN-Qhubeka), Sylvain Chavanel (IAM), Omar Fraile (Caja Rural), Walter Pedraza (Colombia), Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step), Alexis Gougeard (), Ilia Koshevoy (Lampre-Merida) and Maarten Tjallingii (LottoNL-Jumbo). They had a three-minute lead over the peloton as they crossed the Alto de Mijas, with Fraile taking the mountains points. The first significant incident of the day was Paolo Tiralongo's abandoning the race; he had failed to recover from the crash on stage 2. Fraile also won the second mountain sprint of the day on the Puerto del León to take the lead of the mountains classification.\nDespite the exposed course of the race, there were no significant winds and the most notable incident was the crash of Nacer Bouhanni () in the main peloton. Bouhanni clashed wheels with Daniele Bennati (Tinkoff-Saxo) with to the end of the stage; both returned to the main peloton. Bouhanni was assisted in getting back to the peloton by a \"sticky bottle\", where his \"directeur sportif\" handed him a bottle of water; handing the bottle over took twelve seconds, during which time the team car accelerated, helping Bouhanni in his chase. The incident drew comparisons with the one that had led to Nibali's disqualification the previous day; Bouhanni, however, was fined .\nAfter the intermediate sprint – won by Chavanel – the breakaway broke up, with Tjallingii and Gougeard continuing in the lead; at one point they were 1' 40\" ahead of the chasing peloton. The peloton was controlled by Tinkoff-Saxo (riding for Peter Sagan) and Giant-Alpecin (riding for John Degenkolb). The combined pressure of these teams caused Caleb Ewan () to be dropped and the breakaway was caught soon afterwards. Giant-Alpecin led out the sprint, but Sagan and Bouhanni were able to come around Degenkolb and Sagan took the stage victory. The victory was Sagan's first in a Grand Tour in over two years, since stage 7 of the 2013 Tour de France.\nStage 4.\n25 August 2015 — Estepona to Vejer de la Frontera, \nThe fourth stage was a route from Estepona to Vejer de la Frontera. The route did not include any categorised climbs. However, it was not expected to suit the sprinters, because there was a sharp incline in the closing part of the stage. With remaining, there was a section at approximately 13%, followed by a flatter section, a short descent and then another incline to the line. The roads used were narrow and twisting; the finale was expected to suit the puncheurs.\nThe breakaway was again swift to form in the early part of the stage. It included six riders: Mickaël Delage (), Bert-Jan Lindeman (LottoNL-Jumbo), Nikolas Maes (Etixx-Quick Step), Jimmy Engoulvent (Europcar), Kristijan Đurasek (Lampre-Merida) and Markel Irizar (Trek Factory Racing). Their lead extended to thirteen minutes early in the stage, but it was quickly cut down by along with Movistar and Katusha, to around seven minutes at the halfway point of the stage. joined the chase in the second half of the stage and the lead was gradually reduced.\nThe most significant moment during the chase came from the finish, when several riders fell on a tight corner. These included Tejay van Garderen (BMC), who was helped to return to the peloton by his teammates. Another rider caught up in the incident was Ben King (), who stood by the side of the road waiting for his team to bring him a new bike. While he was waiting, one spectator stole his bicycle computer and another attempted to ride off on his bike, although a mechanical problem stopped him.\nEngoulvent and Irizar attacked from the breakaway and gained a 30-second lead, but they were caught by the peloton before the ascent in the final kilometres. Tosh Van der Sande () was the first rider to attack; after he fell back, Pello Bilbao (Caja Rural) attacked with to the finish. He was caught later, at which point Samuel Sánchez (BMC) and Nicolas Roche attacked. They initially had a significant lead, but the incline in the final part of the stage allowed the peloton to come back to them. Sánchez was caught first, with Roche caught in the final . Alejandro Valverde won the stage, with Sagan second and Daniel Moreno () third. Roche held on for fourth place on the stage. The stage was the ninth Vuelta stage victory of Valverde's career.\nChaves retained his red jersey and the white jersey of the combination classification, but Sagan took over the lead of the points classification.\nStage 5.\n26 August 2015 — Rota to Alcalá de Guadaíra, \nThe fifth stage was another fairly flat stage: a route from Rota to Alcalá de Guadaíra. \"Cyclingnews.com\" described it as \"on paper, ... the most straightforward stage of the race\". The first part of the course was along the coast, before turning inland towards Jerez de la Frontera then north towards the finish. There was a slight gradient in the final . The principal difficulty in the stage was expected to be the heat, with crosswinds also a possibility.\nThe stage started with a solo attack from Tsgabu Grmay (). After of racing, Iljo Keisse () and Antoine Duchesne () joined him to form a three-man breakaway. The three riders gained a lead of over seven minutes; Giant-Alpecin and Tinkoff-Saxo then began to control the front of the peloton and reduce the breakaway's advantage; with remaining, Grmay, Keisse and Duchesne had a lead of about five minutes. This was reduced further when Cofidis began to assist in the chase in support of Bouhanni. The breakaway broke up after Grmay stopped contributing to the group's effort: Keisse was visibly annoyed at him, then attacked and went off in a solo move. Grmay and Duchesne were first to be caught; Keisse was then brought back by the peloton inside the final .\nThe peloton rode hard on the flat roads approaching the incline at the finish. Astana, Tinkoff-Saxo, Sky and Katusha all contributed at the front of the group before the sprinters' teams took over. MTN-Qhubeka was the first of these, while Cofidis were unable to position Bouhanni correctly. , who had not been involved in the chase for most of the stage, came to the front for the final section, with its several tight corners. Degenkolb was the first to open the sprint with Sagan on his wheel, but 's Caleb Ewan was able to come past both of them to take the stage victory. Degenkolb was second and Sagan third. The stage was Ewan's first Grand Tour stage victory: the Vuelta was his first Grand Tour and came in the first year of his professional career.\nThere were several splits in the peloton at the finish. Fourteen riders – including Chris Froome, Tom Dumoulin, Samuel Sánchez and Rafał Majka – finished two seconds behind Ewan, with most of the other general classification riders – including Chaves, Valverde, Rodríguez and Aru – a further six seconds back. Dumoulin therefore took over the race lead from Chaves by one second; Chaves retained his lead of the combination classification.\nStage 6.\n27 August 2015 — Córdoba to Sierra de Cazorla, \nThe sixth stage was a route from Córdoba to Sierra de Cazorla. The route was consistently undulating, with small hills throughout the first two-thirds. The final third was the most difficult and included two third-category climbs. The first of these was the Alto de Baeza ( at 3.9%), the summit of which came with to the end of the stage. Another undulating section was followed by a descent and then a long climb to the finish. The road climbed consistently for around before a short descent and then the climb to the summit finish, the Alto de Cazorla. This final climb was at 6.3% and was expected to produce some of the biggest gaps of the Vuelta so far.\nThe day's breakaway took a long time to form. Various riders attacked, but the peloton brought back all the moves for the first of racing. Eventually a five-rider breakaway was allowed to form, composed of Steve Cummings (MTN-Qhubeka), Peter Velits (BMC), Kristijan Đurasek (Lampre-Merida), Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step), and Cyril Gautier (Europcar), and they were soon joined by Miguel Ángel Rubiano (Colombia). The six riders gained a lead of over four minutes, but it was already being brought back by the peloton by the time they reached the Alto de Baeza, where Gautier was the first rider to the summit. Giant-Alpecin (on behalf of Dumoulin) and Movistar controlled the pace at the front of the peloton. With remaining, as the roads began to go uphill, the lead was under a minute. Cummings attacked with to the end of the stage and built a lead: with to the finish line his lead was 48 seconds. Terpstra was the only rider from the breakaway to chase him; the other riders sat up and were caught by the peloton.\nCummings's lead was slowly reduced by the peloton; he only had a small lead when the categorised portion of the climb started in the final . Esteban Chaves, who was one second behind Dumoulin going into the stage, attacked the peloton with remaining as the roads reached a gradient of 15%. Chaves said after the stage that he was worried that he had attacked too soon and would not be able to keep a lead to the top of the climb. He quickly caught and passed Cummings. When the gradient eased with remaining, Dumoulin counter-attacked to try to defend his red jersey. Other attacks came from Dan Martin and from Nicolas Roche, but they were unable to catch Chaves, who held on to take the stage victory. Martin finished second, five seconds behind Chaves, with Dumoulin on the same time. A large group, including all the general classification favourites, finished six seconds further back.\nChaves's win was his second of the race and the third for . With the aid of the time bonuses, he moved into a ten-second lead ahead of Dumoulin and took back the red jersey. He also retained the white jersey of the combination classification. Martin moved into third place overall, 33 seconds behind Chaves. Alejandro Valverde said after the stage that he now considered Chaves a \"big rival\" for the overall victory.\nStage 7.\n28 August 2015 — Jódar to La Alpujarra, \nThe seventh stage included the most significant summit finish of the race so far. The route started in Jódar and travelled to La Alpujarra. The route was generally south, looping around the western part of the Sierra Nevada and finishing on the edge of the mountain range. The roads were up and down all day, though there were only two categorised climbs. The first of these was the Puerto de los Blancares ( at 3.3%), the summit of which came after . The next also followed roads that consistently went up and down, with very few flat sections. The final climb started before the finish line and had an average gradient of 5%. This was the Alto de Capileira, which was rated as a first-category climb. The climb came in three sections: the first climbed consistently; there were then around of fairly flat roads; the final were the steepest part of the climb, with sections of around 14% towards the top.\nThe breakaway was quick to form, with five riders going on the attack. These were Carlos Quintero (Colombia), Amets Txurruka (Caja Rural), Ilia Koshevoy (Lampre-Merida), Bert-Jan Lindeman (LottoNL-Jumbo) and Jérôme Cousin (Europcar). The teams in the peloton, especially , were not willing to expend significant effort and the gap was nearly eight minutes after of racing. This increased further and at one point exceeded thirteen minutes. Shortly after this, however, work from Movistar began to reduce the advantage. A large number of riders were dropped from the peloton under Movistar's pressure and the gap fell to five minutes. The pressure continued until the flat section midway up the climb; here their pressure eased and Astana began to take responsibility for the chase.\nCousin was the first of the riders in the breakaway to attack. Txurruka brought him back, but the acceleration was too much for Quintero, who was dropped from the break. Koshevoy then attacked several times; he dropped Txurruka, but Cousin and Lindeman were able to follow him and the breakaway was reduced to three riders. It was reduced further when there was a collision in the final between Cousin and Koshevoy; Koshevoy was able to continue, but Cousin was dropped from the break. Lindeman attacked with about remaining to the finish and took the victory by nine seconds. The victory was Lindeman's first World Tour victory.\nIn the main peloton, Dan Martin was the first to attack, but he was quickly brought back by a group of riders. A significant attack then came from Fabio Aru, who immediately won a gap ahead of the other riders in the group. Aru went past Cousin and finished the stage third, 29\" behind Lindeman. The main group of general classification riders came in seven seconds behind Aru. Aru's attack, however, had dropped a large number of riders from the group, including Chris Froome, Mikel Landa and Tejay van Garderen. Froome fell out of the top ten. Chaves, however, finished in the main group and retained his lead in the general classification. His sixth-place finish also won him enough points to move into the lead of the points classification. Aru moved up two places into eighth; Domenico Pozzovivo () also entered the top ten.\nStage 8.\n29 August 2015 — Puebla de Don Fadrique to Murcia, \nThe eighth stage was a stage from in the province of Granada to , the home town of Alejandro Valverde. The first of the stage were generally downhill. This was followed by a section of flat roads before the riders arrived in Murcia. After passing through an intermediate sprint, the riders left the town for two laps of an circuit. This included the third-category climb of the ( at 7.5%). After the second lap, there were about of flat roads, after which the riders returned to the centre of Murcia for the stage finish. The stage was expected to be too difficult for the sprinters.\nThe stage's early breakaway was formed of six riders: Alex Howes (Cannondale-Garmin), Iljo Keisse (Etixx-Quick-Step), Jimmy Engoulvent (Europcar), Tom Van Asbroeck (LottoNL-Jumbo), Jasper De Buyst (Lotto-Soudal), and Ángel Madrazo (Colombia). They built a lead of nearly five minutes, but Giant-Alpecin and Tinkoff-Saxo controlled their advantage throughout. The first major incident of the day was a crash that came from the finish line, as the peloton approached the first of the day's climbs. This involved more than twenty riders. Four riders were forced to withdraw from the race: Tejay van Garderen (BMC), Dan Martin (Cannondale-Garmin), Kris Boeckmans (Lotto-Soudal) and Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis). Van Garderen suffered a broken shoulder and Martin a broken clavicle. Boeckmans had been at the origin of the crash: he was drinking from a bidon when he hit a hole in the road and fell hard to the ground. He suffered a range of injuries, including facial trauma and fractures, a concussion, broken ribs and a pneumothorax; he was taken to hospital and placed in an induced coma. He remained in the coma for over a week; he left hospital several weeks later following major facial surgery. Among the other riders delayed in the crash were Chaves, the race leader, and Jasper Stuyven ().\nThe breakaway's lead was reduced to less than two minutes at the foot of the first climb. Howes attacked alone, with Madrazo following. On the descent, however, Howes fell. He was passed by Madrazo and by the peloton, which had caught the remainder of the breakaway. On the flat section that followed the climb, several groups, including that of Chaves, came back together. Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) attacked, but was soon caught and passed by his teammate Gianluca Brambilla, who was part of a four-man group that formed on the final ascent of the day. Tom Dumoulin attempted to control the peloton on the climb, but there were attacks from various riders including some of the general classification favourites. After the descent, the groups came back together and the lead group was formed of approximately 40 riders.\nAnother breakaway was then formed by José Gonçalves (), Kenny Elissonde (FDJ) and Alberto Losada (Katusha); although they gained a lead of nearly 20 seconds, they were brought back by Trek and Tinkoff-Saxo. With remaining, there was another crash. This involved Peter Sagan, who was hit from behind by a motorbike belonging to the Shimano neutral service team and knocked to the ground with leg injuries. Following the incident, Sagan gestured towards the motorbike and appeared to kick his own bike and to punch the medical car. He was dropped from the lead group and was unable to contest the sprint.\nOne last attack came from Adam Hansen (Lotto-Soudal) with remaining, but he was unable to escape the bunch. The stage therefore came down to a sprint, which was won by Jasper Stuyven, with Pello Bilbao () second and Kévin Reza (FDJ) third. This was the first win of Stuyven's professional career. Except for Dan Martin's withdrawal, there were no significant changes to the standings in the general classification.\nFollowing the stage, however, it was announced by Trek Factory Racing that Stuyven had suffered a broken scaphoid in the first major crash and he was forced to withdraw from the race. Sagan was also forced to abandon the Vuelta after the stage, as he had suffered cuts and burns on his left side and a contusion in his left arm. Sagan was also fined for his behaviour following the crash, while the rider of the motorbike was excluded from the remainder of the Vuelta.\nStage 9.\n30 August 2015 — Torrevieja to Cumbre del Sol, Benitachell, \nThe ninth stage took the riders along the coast (the Costa Blanca) from Torrevieja to a summit finish on the (also known as the ) outside Benitachell. The first of the stage were fairly straightforward, with no significant climbs. After this, however, the riders entered a complex sequence of roads around the finishing town. First they climbed the first of the , then descended for a loop to the north of Benitachell. They then returned to the same roads that they had used earlier, but continued for the full length of the climb ( at 8.9%). The climb was expected to suit the punchy climbers.\nThe early breakaway included fourteen riders. These were Alexis Gougeard (), Nikolas Maes, Pieter Serry and Maxime Bouet (all Etixx-Quick Step), Geraint Thomas (Sky), Lorenzo Manzin (FDJ), Mattia Cattaneo (Lampre-Merida), Yoann Bagot (Cofidis), Maarten Tjallingii (LottoNL-Jumbo), Omar Fraile (Caja Rural), Tony Hurel (Europcar), Danny van Poppel (Trek Factory Racing), Pavel Brutt (Tinkoff-Saxo) and Songezo Jim (MTN-Qhubeka). The breakaway's lead was over five minutes at one point, but was gradually reduced as the peloton approached the final climb of the day; Katusha did most of the work through the day on behalf of Joaquim Rodríguez. The breakaway led over the first, partial climb of the , with Fraile the first to the top of the climb to extend his lead in the mountains classification.\nThe breakaway was eventually caught at the bottom of the final climb. Valverde, who had crashed earlier in the day, was the first to attack. As soon as he was caught, his teammate Nairo Quintana put in his own attack. These attacks dropped Chris Froome from the front group. Dumoulin was the next to attack, seeking to take back the race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.\nDumoulin led the race under the \"\" with Froome chasing; Rodríguez was by this point the only rider able to stay with Froome. As soon as the two riders caught Dumoulin, Froome attacked again and briefly held the lead. Dumoulin was stronger in the final, steep . He caught Froome and came around to take the stage win and the race lead, finishing 2\" ahead of Froome. Rodríguez was a further 3\" behind, with significant time gaps to the other general classification riders. Chaves finished in fifteenth place, nearly a minute behind Dumoulin, and fell to third on the general classification.\nStage 10.\n31 August 2015 — Valencia to Castellón de la Plana, \nThe tenth stage was the final one before the first rest day. It was a route from Valencia to . The stage again travelled north between two coastal towns; this stage, however, took an inland, hillier route. The first of the day's two climbs was the third-category ( at 4.4%). After the descent from the climb, there were more hilly roads before another descent to sea level. There were then around of flat roads, taking the riders through Castellón and out again to the north, before the day's second climb. This was the second-category ( at 5.6%). From the top of the climb there were of descent and flat roads to the finish line. The stage was expected to suit the sprinters.\nThe breakaway took some time to form; on the first climb of the day, a group of 40 riders went clear, including at least one rider from every team in the race. The group was never allowed to get clear, with Giant-Alpecin and Movistar determined to set up the stage victory for their sprinters. The breakaway's lead was consistently around one minute, with various riders dropping back to the main group and others attacking. The breakaway was caught with remaining in the stage. Niki Terpstra attacked, as he had done on several other stages, but was not able to escape the peloton, which came into the final climb together. Nicolas Roche (Sky) was involved in a crash on a roundabout and received treatment from the medical car as his teammates helped him back into the main pack.\nThere were several attacks on the climb. The first of these came from Alessandro De Marchi (BMC), with Romain Sicard (Europcar) following him. A second attack came from Kenny Elissonde (FDJ) and Jérôme Coppel (). Elissonde caught and passed Sicard and De Marchi and set off alone. Another attack came from Gianluca Brambilla (Etixx-Quick Step), while Dumoulin himself was leading the peloton in order to defend his race lead and set up the sprint for Degenkolb, his teammate. De Marchi and Sicard caught Elissonde at the top of the climb, where they were around 30\" ahead of the peloton. Sergio Henao (Sky) who had suffered a puncture before the climb and was riding hard to get back into the peloton, crashed on the descent and lost his bike over the side of the road; he lost several minutes and fell from fourteenth place overall to twenty-sixth.\nAt the foot of the climb, the leading group only had a small advantage over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.\nStage 11.\n2 September 2015 — Andorra la Vella to Cortals d'Encamp, \nThe eleventh stage came after the first rest day of the Vuelta and a transfer to Andorra la Vella. Although a short stage at just , it was very difficult, with six categorised climbs and few flat roads. It started in Andorra la Vella and immediately climbed the first-category Collada de Beixalis ( at 8.7%). After the descent and some false flat, the riders climbed the first-category Coll D'Ordino ( at 7%), followed by another long descent past Andorra la Vella and onto the next first-category climb, the Coll de la Rabassa ( at 6.6%). Following the descent, the riders climbed the hardest climb of the day, the \"\"-category Collada de la Gallina ( at 8.5%). After the descent, the riders once again went past Andorra la Vella (this time climbing the second-category Alto de la Cormella on the way) to reach the foot of the final climb. This was the Alto Els Cortals d'Encamp and was at 9.1%. The stage was designed by Joaquim Rodríguez; before the stage, he described it as \"dramatic\". The manager of Movistar, Eusebio Unzué, described it as \"the toughest Vuelta stage that he has seen in more than 30 years\". Javier Guillén, the race director, agreed, describing it as \"possibly the hardest stage we have ever put together in terms of the amount of climbing involved\".\nThe first significant moment came in the approach to the Collada de Beixalis, the first climb of the day. Chris Froome hit a wooden barrier and then a wall, injuring his left shoulder and knee and his right foot. He was dropped from the lead group and, with the help of teammates, started a long chase back to the leading group. The first riders to attack were Romain Sicard (Europcar) and Darwin Atapuma (BMC); they were followed by seventeen other riders, including Fraile, the leader of the mountains classification. They led over the summit of the climb, with Fraile the first over the summit to extend his lead in the classification. Froome regained contact with the main group on the descent from the climb.\nThere was another significant incident at the bottom of the first climb. This involved Sérgio Paulinho (Tinkoff-Saxo): he collided with a race motorbike, causing significant cuts to his leg. Paulinho first attempted to continue riding; he was then treated by the race doctor, who put staples in his leg. He lay down on the road for treatment. Although he attempted to continue riding, he was forced to withdraw from the race just before the summit of the climb; he then went to hospital and received seventeen stitches. Paulinho's teammate Peter Sagan had also been hit by a motorbike on stage 8 and the team had issued a statement calling for an apology from the race organisers and measures to prevent such incidents. Following Paulinho's incident, Oleg Tinkov, the team's owner, suggested on Twitter that the team may withdraw from the race; a statement from the team after the stage said, \"the team will consider whether it is safe to continue racing under the current arrangements\".\nRubén Plaza (Lampre-Merida) led the breakaway over the second climb of the day, with Fraile second. The breakaway was around two minutes ahead of the peloton. Imanol Erviti (Movistar) attacked on the descent and led the race solo for some distance; he was first to reach the summit of the next climb, the Coll de la Rabassa, with Fraile again second. He was eventually brought back by work from Mikel Landa (Astana) on the descent. On the Coll de la Gallina the breakaway broke up: the lead group was formed of Landa and Fraile, along with Ian Boswell (Sky), Romain Sicard (Europcar), Nelson Oliveira (Lampre-Merida), Darwin Atapuma (BMC) and Paweł Poljański (Tinkoff-Saxo). Fraile was first over the summit. The climb also caused difficulty in the main group: Chris Froome was unable to stay in the group; his injured shoulder was treated at the medical car and he was then guided through the rest of the stage by Geraint Thomas. Froome lost two minutes on the climb. Nicolas Roche was also dropped from the lead group and Mikel Nieve took over the leadership of Team Sky.\nOn the descent, Valverde and Rodríguez attacked and were joined by teammates from the breakaway. They had a 40-second advantage over a group containing Dumoulin and Fabio Aru. Aru's teammate Dario Cataldo was able to bring him back to Valverde and Rodríguez; Dumoulin was then also able to return to the group.\nLanda attacked the breakaway at the bottom of the final climb, while Aru attacked the group of favourites at approximately the same point. Aru was followed by Valverde and Rodríguez, but another attack from the finish left him alone. Landa, meanwhile, had taken his team radio earpiece out and was ignoring instructions from his team to drop back and assist Aru. Landa rode alone to the top of the climb and took the stage victory. Aru caught and passed Ian Boswell – the only other rider remaining from the breakaway – and finished the stage 1' 22\" behind Landa. Boswell took third place, while Rodríguez was the first of Aru's general classification rivals to finish, 37\" behind him. Tom Dumoulin and Esteban Chaves finished together, losing nearly two minutes. Aru therefore took the lead of the general classification, 27\" ahead of Rodríguez, with Dumoulin 3\" further back in third. Quintana was also dropped on the climb, losing nearly three minutes to Aru, and fell to ninth on the general classification; he later revealed that he had been suffering from a fever. Froome, meanwhile, finished nearly nine minutes down and struggled to put weight on his foot after the stage. An MRI scan revealed a break in his foot and he withdrew from the Vuelta the following morning."

        "title": "2015 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21",
        "text": "The 2015 Vuelta a España was a three-week Grand Tour cycling race that took place principally in Spain between 22 August and 13 September 2015; two stages also took place partly or wholly in Andorra. The final ten stages took the race from the mountains of Andorra to the conclusion of the Vuelta in Madrid. After the first eleven stages, Fabio Aru () held the race lead, around half a minute ahead of Joaquim Rodríguez () and Tom Dumoulin ().\nStage 12 was a flat stage, won by Danny van Poppel (). Stage 13 was won by Nelson Oliveira () from the breakaway; it was followed by a series of three consecutive summit finishes. The first of these was won by Alessandro De Marchi (), as Aru and Rodríguez gained time on Dumoulin. Rodríguez won stage 15, putting him just one second behind Aru, while Dumoulin again lost significant time. Stage 16 was the final summit finish of the race and the final stage of the second week. It was won by Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), again from the breakaway. Rodríguez gained further time on Aru and took over the race lead, though only by a single second, while Dumoulin again lost time. The following day was a rest day.\nThe final week of the race began with an individual time trial on stage 17. This was Dumoulin's speciality and he won the stage by over a minute, with all his rivals for the general classification even further behind. He moved into the race lead, three seconds ahead of Aru, while Rodríguez dropped to more than a minute off the race lead. The subsequent three stages were all won by the breakaway, with Aru and his team trying to attack Dumoulin throughout. They were won by Nicolas Roche (), Alexis Gougeard () and Rubén Plaza () respectively. Plaza's victory came after a solo breakaway. On the same stage, Aru was finally able to escape from Dumoulin, who lost nearly four minutes and fell to sixth place, while Aru took the overall lead. Stage 21, the final stage of the race, was a sprint stage that took the riders into Madrid. It was won by John Degenkolb (Giant-Alpecin), while Aru sealed his overall victory ahead of Rodríguez and Rafał Majka ().\nStage 12.\n3 September 2015 — Escaldes-Engordany, Andorra to Lleida, \nStage 12 started in Escaldes-Engordany, on the outskirts of Andorra la Vella, but the riders immediately left Andorra to return to Spain for the remainder of the Vuelta. The stage was much flatter than the previous day: there was just one categorised climb on the route. This was the second-category Coll de Bóixols ( at 5%). The summit came after of racing, with to the finish line. The remainder of the stage was mostly flat, and the finish was relatively uncomplicated: there were of straight roads leading into Lleida, with only two roundabouts. The stage was expected to suit the sprinters, as their teams would have plenty of time after the climb to catch a breakaway.\nDespite Oleg Tinkov's threat to pull from the race, all the teams started the race in Andorra, with Chris Froome () the only rider not to start the stage. The day's breakaway was fairly quick to form: Maxime Bouet (), Miguel Ángel Rubiano (), Jaco Venter (), Bert-Jan Lindeman () and Alexis Gougeard () escaped early in the stage. Bouet was the best-placed of the riders on the general classification, over twenty minutes behind Fabio Aru (). They led over the Coll de Bóixols (Bouet was the first to the summit) and built a three-minute lead over the peloton. Astana were unwilling to commit to the chase, so the peloton was generally led by and .\nThe five riders in the breakaway rode strongly and the peloton was forced to ride hard all day to chase down their lead. With remaining, the breakaway had a lead of 1' 20\". A few kilometres later, the lead was under a minute. 's efforts stopped around from the end of the stage, when their sprinter Danny van Poppel suffered a flat tyre. After a conversation with the team, van Poppel decided to change his wheel. He then chased back into the peloton through the team cars and several teammates helped him back to the front of the group; other riders remained at the front to chase the breakaway down after van Poppel had rejoined the group.\nWith remaining, the breakaway had not been caught and still had a lead of 20\". Bouet and Gougeard both attacked and were brought back. Venter then attacked in the final , with only Bouet able to follow, but they were caught by the peloton as the road rose to the finish line. The sprint was disorganised, with only attempting to control it. Daryl Impey () sprinted first; van Poppel followed and came around him to take the stage victory. Impey held on to take second place with Tosh Van der Sande () third. The victory was van Poppel's first Grand Tour stage victory. All the general classification riders finished in the peloton with the standings unchanged.\nStage 13.\n4 September 2015 — Calatayud to Tarazona, \nThe thirteenth stage was the last before three consecutive summit finishes. The stage covered a route from Calatayud to Tarazona. There were three categorised climbs: the third-category Alto Collado de Oseja ( at 3.7%) and the first-category Alto de Beratón ( at 4.7%) came in the first half of the stage; the final climb was the third-category Alto de Moncayo ( at 4.5%), the summit of which came with to the finish. The stage was expected to suit riders from a breakaway.\nAs the breakaway was expected to win the stage, the day's racing began with strong competition to get into the move. At one point a group of about 50 riders – more than a quarter of the peloton – was in a lead group, but this was caught before the Alto Collado de Oseja. Sylvain Chavanel () initiated the main move of the day on this first climb. Chavanel was then joined by seven other riders: Nelson Oliveira and Rubén Plaza (both ), Yukiya Arashiro (), Alessandro De Marchi (BMC), Mikaël Cherel (), Jérôme Coppel () and Cameron Meyer (). Plaza was the first of the group to cross the summit of the climb. Nairo Quintana (Movistar), who had been in eighth place before the stage, was dropped from the peloton on the climb; his teammates were able to bring him back to the group after the summit.\nA second group, containing 16 riders, had formed on the road. These were Sergio Henao and Nicolas Roche (Sky), Rinaldo Nocentini (Ag2r–La Mondiale), David Arroyo (), Yoann Bagot and Julien Simon (), Niki Terpstra and Gianluca Brambilla (), Kenny Elissonde and Kévin Reza (FDJ), Valerio Conti (), Maxime Monfort (), José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar), Steve Cummings (), Romain Sicard (Europcar) and Paweł Poljański (). On the climb of the Alto de Beratón, the two lead groups came together to make a 24-man breakaway. Sicard and Brambilla were the two best-placed riders in the breakaway, over six minutes behind Aru, and their presence forced Astana to keep the breakaway within reach; on the descent the lead was around four minutes.\nThe breakaway stayed together until the final climb. Chavanel and Oliveira were the first to attack, but Poljański was able to come past them and led solo at the top of the climb. He was caught before the descent, however, whereupon Oliveira attacked again. He reached speeds of around and had opened up a large lead by the foot of the descent. Oliveira rode the final of the stage alone – using his strong time-trialling skills – and was able to maintain his advantage. He was aided by Plaza and Conti, who marked the attacks that came from the rest of the group, and took a solo stage victory. Simon won the sprint for second place, with Roche in second, as the group finished a minute behind Oliveira. This was the first Grand Tour stage win of Oliveira's career.\nTowards the end of the stage, there was an attack in the main peloton from Gediminas Bagdonas (); he finished 4' 43\" behind Oliveira. \"Cycling Weekly\" described his attack as \"strange\" and suggested that he had briefly thought he could take the stage victory himself. The rest of the peloton came in five seconds later. The top eight in the general classification were unchanged; Quintana and Louis Meintjes (MTN-Qhubeka) dropped out of the top ten, however, with Sicard and Brambilla moving up thanks to their presence in the day's breakaway.\nStage 14.\n5 September 2015 — Vitoria-Gasteiz to Alto Campoo, , \nThe fourteenth stage was the first of three consecutive summit finishes. It began in Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital of the Basque Country, and took the riders to Alto Campoo. The stage included three categorised climbs, all of which came in the second half of the stage. The first of the stage took the riders west, before the riders reached the first categorised climb. This was the third-category Puerto Estacas de Trueba ( at 2.9%). After the descent, the riders immediately climbed the first-category Puerto del Escudo ( at 6.4%). There was then a flat section of around that took the riders to the foot of the final climb. This was the Alto Campoo ( at 5.5%). The climb was fairly regular and, though long, was not particularly steep and was not expected to result in large gaps between the general classification riders.\nThere was again aggressive racing for the first hour to get into the breakaway. Alessandro De Marchi (BMC) attacked three times during this period. The third attack came after and ended up forming the day's main breakaway. De Marchi was joined by Salvatore Puccio (Sky), José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar), Mikaël Cherel (AG2R La Mondiale) and Carlos Quintero (). Cherel was the best-placed rider on the general classification; he was, however, over an hour down, so there was no urgent need for the peloton to chase. At the top of the first climb, the five riders had a lead of over eight minutes. This extended to nearly ten minutes following the descent and was still over nine minutes at the base of the day's final climb. Cherel was the first to attack and Puccio was the first of the riders to be dropped, though he quickly came back to the group. De Marchi pulled the other three riders back to Cherel, whereupon attacks came from Puccio and Rojas. De Marchi dropped Cherel and Quintero, then caught Rojas. With remaining, he passed Puccio and went on to take the stage victory. Puccio finished 21 seconds further back in second place, with Rojas another 11 seconds behind in third.\nAstana, meanwhile, led the peloton in support of Aru. Luis León Sánchez and Mikel Landa were the first to apply pressure on the climb; Tom Dumoulin () was isolated from most of his teammates as the group was reduced to around 40 riders. Dario Cataldo took over and, when he tired, Aru attacked and only Quintana was able to follow for long. Rodríguez and Chaves were eventually able to catch Aru and Quintana. Quintana attacked on the steepest portion of the climb; he crossed the finish line 3' 32\" behind De Marchi in sixth place on the stage. Rodríguez was six seconds behind, with Chaves and Aru a further second back. Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) and Dumoulin finished together, 19 seconds behind Aru. Dumoulin was therefore now 49 seconds behind Aru overall.\nStage 15.\n6 September 2015 — Comillas to Sotres, Cabrales, \nThe fifteenth stage was the second of three consecutive stages with summit finishes. It was a route from Comillas to Sotres. The first of the stage were fairly flat. The first climb was the second-category climb of the Alto del Torno ( at 3.2%). The descent was followed by around of flat roads before the uncategorised climb at Ortiguero. This was followed by more flat roads leading to the base of the final climb, which started after . This was the first-category Alto de Sotres ( at 7.9%). The climb was mixed, with a steep first section, followed by around of false flat, a section of around 7% and then a very steep final section.\nThe breakaway again took a long time to form. The peloton had covered around before a nine-rider group formed. The riders were Blel Kadri (AG2R-La Mondiale), Ricardo Vilela (), Dominique Rollin (Cofidis), Brayan Ramírez (Colombia), Nikolas Maes (Etixx–Quick-Step), Natnael Berhane (MTN-Qhubeka), Pierre Rolland (Europcar), Maarten Tjallingii (Lotto NL-Jumbo), and Haimar Zubeldia (). The breakaway was chased hard by Movistar, who were working to improve Nairo Quintana's overall position in the race and their lead never went over five minutes. After Rollin was the first to the summit of the Alto del Torno, the lead dropped quickly; the breakaway had just two minutes' lead at the base of the final climb.\nAs Movistar continued to ride hard at the beginning of the climb, most of the break was caught, with only Zubeldia able to continue alone for any length of time. He was caught with around remaining. Quintana put in an attack at this point, but he was marked by Luis León Sánchez, as the rest of the Astana team brought the move back. Astana continued setting the pace most of the way up the climb. Dumoulin was struggling to stay with the group with around remaining and he was dropped shortly afterwards. He spent the rest of the climb riding at tempo to attempt to limit his losses. Giovanni Visconti (Movistar) took up the pace-setting at the front of the group. In the last , however, Joaquim Rodríguez put in a strong attack that dropped Quintana, along with most of the other riders. Aru and Majka attempted to chase; Aru then dropped off and was caught by Esteban Chaves (Orica–GreenEDGE), Landa and Quintana. Rodríguez continued on to take the stage victory – his tenth in the Vuelta – with Majka 12 seconds behind in second place. Quintana and Aru finished together, 15 seconds behind Rodríguez. Dumoulin, who had at one point been over 1' 20\" behind, finished in eleventh place on the stage, 51 seconds back.\nAt the end of the stage, Aru retained the red jersey, but Rodríguez was now just one second behind. Dumoulin dropped to fourth place – 1' 25\" behind Aru – with Majka moving up into third. Rodríguez also took the lead in both the points and combination classifications.\nStage 16.\n7 September 2015 — Luarca to Ermita del Alba, Quirós, \nThe sixteenth stage was the final stage of the second week of the race. It was the third of three consecutive summit finishes and included seven categorised climbs as the race entered the Cantabrian Mountains. The stage was a route from Luarca to Quirós. The road climbed from the very start: the third-category Alto de Aristébano ( at 3.4%) began at the end of the neutral zone. After the descent and some small uncategorised climbs came the second-category Alto de Piedratecha ( at 4.8%), the summit of which came after . This was followed by a plateau and a long descent, then the third-category Alto de Cabruñana ( at 6.7%). Around of flat roads followed, before the second-category climb of the Alto del Tenebredo ( at 8.9%). There was then a descent and around of flat roads. At this point there were remaining, which included almost no flat roads. First came the second-category climb of the Alto del Cordal ( at 5.7%), then the first-category Alto de la Cobertoria ( at 8.7%). These climbs often come before the famous climb of the Alto de l'Angliru, but the 2015 edition of the race introduced a new climb, the special-category Alto Ermita de Alba. This was a climb at 11.1%, including sections at over 20%. The Alto Ermita de Alba was described by Javier Guillén, the race director, as \"very tough\".\nA ten-rider breakaway formed quickly at the beginning of the stage. The riders were Fränk Schleck (), Rodolfo Torres (Colombia), Moreno Moser (Cannondale–Garmin), Cyril Lemoine (Cofidis), Larry Warbasse (IAM), George Bennett (LottoNL-Jumbo), Omar Fraile (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Carlos Verona (Etixx–Quick-Step), Pierre Rolland (Europcar) and Tsgabu Grmay (Lampre–Mérida). Fraile won each of the first five climbs of the day to extend his lead in the mountains classification. In the peloton, meanwhile, there was a dispute between Astana and Katusha – the teams of Aru and Rodríguez – over who would lead the chase. At one point the lead was over 20 minutes, but eventually Katusha took on the chase and began to bring the lead group back.\nThe lead group broke up on the penultimate climb, the Alto de la Cobertoria, with Torres and Schleck going clear. They were still 10 minutes ahead of the peloton. The two riders came into the final climb together, with Fraile, Verona and Bennett chasing. Schleck attacked Torres several times on the slopes of the Ermita de Alba. Although Torres was able to follow these initial attacks, Schleck put in another, stronger attack with around to the finish. Schleck rode away on the steepest portion of the climb to take the stage victory – his first victory in a Grand Tour since the 2009 Tour de France and his first ever stage victory in the Vuelta a España. Torres finished second, over a minute behind, with Moser another 38 seconds behind in third.\nIn the main peloton, the main action came on the final three climbs. Tinkoff–Saxo rode hard on the first of these, the Alto del Cordal, before Astana did the same on the Alto de la Cobertoria. This reduced the peloton to a group of fifteen riders. Despite the attempts of the other teams, Dumoulin was able to follow the other riders. On the final climb, Paweł Poljański put in a strong effort on behalf of Majka, before Landa took over at the front of the group. Landa rode hard all the way up the climb; this caused Aru, his teammate, to struggle, as well as several of the other riders. Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) and Chaves were both dropped in the final . Dumoulin held on to the group until the final kilometre. At that moment, Rodríguez attacked and finished first among the general classification riders, nearly nine minutes behind Schleck. Aru chased hard, but finished two seconds behind Rodríguez and so lost the red jersey by one second. Dumoulin lost 27 seconds to Rodríguez, putting him 1' 51\" behind the race leader with his strongest discipline – the individual time trial – to come after the rest day.\nStage 17.\n9 September 2015 — Burgos, Individual time trial (ITT)\nThe seventeenth stage followed the final rest day of the race and was the only individual time trial of the Vuelta. It started and finished in the city of Burgos and was mostly flat. The route approximately followed a figure-of-eight pattern. The first loop left the city to the east and took the riders to Cardeñajimeno. Here the course turned south towards Carcedo de Burgos, passing the monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña in Castrillo del Val. This was the hilliest portion of the course. The route turned to the north-west in Carcedo de Burgos and returned to Burgos itself after . The second loop of the course began by taking the riders west and then north across the Arlanzón River. The route continued west until a tight turn with to the finish line. After this, the route continued east and passed the city centre to the north. With to go, the route turned back into the city. The final part of the course included several tight corners and finished outside Burgos Cathedral. The course was expected to suit the strong rouleurs and time-trialists; it was unusual among recent Vuelta time-trial courses because it did not contain any significant climbs. The course was particularly expected to favour Tom Dumoulin: during the rest day he described the course as \"exactly what I like\".\nThe 167 riders remaining in the Vuelta set off in reverse order. Boy van Poppel (Trek Factory Racing) was in last place on the general classification before the stage and therefore was the first to start. The following 137 riders set off at one-minute intervals; the final 29 riders started at two-minute intervals. Joaquim Rodríguez was the last rider to start.\nThe first rider to set a benchmark time was Gediminas Bagdonas (AG2R-La Mondiale), who finished the course in 49' 22\"; Bagdonas caught Boy van Poppel on the finish line, despite starting four minutes behind him. The first significant time, however, was set by Maciej Bodnar (), the eighteenth rider to start. He completed the course in 47' 05\" and took the lead. Steve Cummings (MTN-Qhubeka) and Vasil Kiryienka (Sky) were among the favourites for the stage victory, but neither was able to challenge Bodnar's time. Two Frenchmen – Jérôme Coppel (IAM) and Romain Sicard (Europcar) – achieved times that would put them in the top 10 at the end of the stage, but Bodnar's time was still leading as the general classification favourites took to the course. As the top five riders were about to start, rain began to fall, although it was not strong enough to affect the riders significantly.\nTom Dumoulin put time into his rivals from the very start of the course. He was first at both the intermediate checkpoints and completed the course in 46' 01\", over a minute ahead of Bodnar. Valverde put in a strong time to finish in third place on the day, with his teammate Quintana sixth. Rodríguez, however, looked uncomfortable on his time trial bicycle throughout the course and lost over three minutes to Dumoulin; he fell to third place overall. Fabio Aru put in a strong ride: he finished tenth on the stage, 1' 53\" behind Dumoulin. Dumoulin therefore took over the race lead, but he was only three seconds ahead of Aru. Aru described his own position in the race as \"not bad at all\".\nStage 18.\n10 September 2015 — Roa de Duero to Riaza, \nStage 18 was a route from Roa de Duero to Riaza. The first part of the stage was fairly flat as the peloton travelled southeast. After was the first climb of the day, the third-category Alto Santibáñez de Ayllón ( at 4%). Soon afterwards was the Alto del Campanario ( at 3.9%). The following were consistently up and down, with barely any flat roads, as the riders travelled south through the Tejera Negra national park, then north towards the stage finish. The final climb of the day came after . This was the first-category Puerto de la Quesera ( at 5.2%). From the summit there were of descent to the finish line in Riaza. The stage was expected to favour riders from a breakaway.\nThe stage again began with a contest to get into the day's breakaway. Eventually a 25-rider breakaway was formed, without any general classification favourites present. Ángel Madrazo () was first at the summit of the first and second climbs of the day, with the peloton over five minutes behind. The break still had a five-minute lead with to the finish line. Astana came to the front of the peloton in order to support Aru and to attempt to isolate Dumoulin from his teammates; Dumoulin stayed close to Aru's wheel. With to race, Joaquim Rodríguez put in an attack, but he was chased down by the Astana team.\nIn the breakaway, Cyril Gautier (Europcar) attacked just before the final climb. On the climb, he was caught and passed by two other riders from the breakaway: Nicolas Roche (Sky) and Haimar Zubeldia (Trek Factory Racing). Roche led over the summit of the Puerto de la Quesera. Astana's work had significantly reduced the breakaway's lead: midway through the climb they were 1' 30\" behind the breakaway. There were several attacks during the climb: Aru attacked Dumoulin six times, with Valverde and Chaves also attempting to escape from the group of favourites. None of them were able to get away, however, and the group came to the top of the climb together, a minute behind Roche and Zubeldia.\nRoche and Zubeldia came to the finish line together. Roche ensured the stage ended in a fast sprint and took the stage victory. This was Roche's second stage victory in the Vuelta and his first for Team Sky. José Gonçalves (), another rider from the early breakaway, finished third, 18\" behind Roche. The group of favourites finished together a further 20\" back, with no changes to the top 10. Omar Fraile, meanwhile, was almost assured of victory in the mountains classification: his 50-point lead over Fränk Schleck was more than the points available on the remaining stages.\nStage 19.\n11 September 2015 — Medina del Campo to Ávila, \nStage 19 was another moderately hilly stage, with a climb and a descent shortly before the finish. It was a route from Medina del Campo to Ávila. The route started with a long section of flat roads that took the riders south through the city of Ávila and across the finish line for the first time, with left in the stage. There was then a loop to the south-east of the city, which began with the climb of the third-category Alto de Valdavia ( at 2.7%). There was then a long descent and a gradual ascent before the final categorised climb of the day. This was the second-category Alto de la Paramera ( at 4.5%). The summit of the climb came with to the finish, and the riders descended back into Ávila. As they entered the city, the road rose steeply on cobbled roads to the finish line.\nUnlike several of the previous days, the breakaway was quick to form. It was made up of 24 riders and went clear after of racing. They quickly built a lead of over 15 minutes. The first significant incident of the day was a crash in the main peloton after . Fabio Aru fell to the ground, while Tom Dumoulin was among the riders delayed. Although Aru made several trips to the medical car after the incident, he was not badly injured. The peloton was led throughout the stage by Giant-Alpecin.\nWith to the end of the stage, Tiago Machado (Katusha) attacked the breakaway. Markel Irizar (Trek Factory Racing) attempted to follow him but suffered a puncture. Although Machado had a lead of 30 seconds at one point, there was a chase from the group behind and his lead fell. Two riders then bridged across to Machado. These were Alexis Gougeard (AG2R-La Mondiale) and Leonardo Duque (Colombia). The three-man group built a lead that increased to 50 seconds. Duque was dropped from the group and was caught by Maxime Monfort (Lotto–Soudal) and Natnael Berhane (MTN-Qhubeka), who had also attacked the breakaway group. On the final categorised climb, with remaining in the stage and an 18-minute lead over the peloton, Machado was dropped by Gougeard, while Berhane was also dropped by the group behind. Monfort caught Machado; they were then joined by Amaël Moinard (BMC) and Andrey Amador (Movistar) to form a four-man group chasing Gougeard. Although they were at times within sight of Gougeard, he was able to stay away and took a solo stage win. On the cobbled section, Nelson Oliveira (Lampre–Mérida) caught and passed the chasing group to take second place on the stage, 40\" behind Gougeard, with Monfort taking third.\nIn the main field, which ultimately finished over 16 minutes behind Gougeard, Valverde attacked on the Alto de la Paramera but was chased by Tinkoff–Saxo. He attacked twice more, eventually being joined by Diego Rosa (Astana) and gaining a few seconds' lead. He dropped Rosa, but the group caught him on the cobbled climb. Dumoulin was supported well by his team: although the lead group had been reduced to 20 riders, he was still accompanied by Lawson Craddock and John Degenkolb. With the assistance of his teammates, Dumoulin attacked on the climb and was joined by Daniel Moreno (Katusha); although Aru chased hard, he lost a further three seconds to Dumoulin, who therefore increased his general classification lead to six seconds. Giant-Alpecin's \"directeur sportif\", Christian Guiberteau, described Degenkolb's riding in support of Dumoulin as \"phenomenal\".\nStage 20.\n12 September 2015 — San Lorenzo de El Escorial to Cercedilla, \nStage 20 was the final mountainous stage of the Vuelta and included four first-category climbs in of racing. The stage began in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, leaving the town to the north and reaching Cercedilla after . The route did not pass the finish line but continued north and started the first climb of the day, the Puerto de Navacerrada ( at 6.6%). After a short plateau and a steep descent, the riders started climbing again with the northern face of the Puerto de la Morcuera ( at 5.4%). After another steep descent, there were around of flat roads, which took the riders around in a loop. They then returned to Cercedilla using the same roads in the opposite direction. This meant that they first climbed the southern face of the Puerto de la Morcuera ( at 6.6%). Following the descent, they reached the final climb of the day, the Puerto de Cotos ( at 5.3%). This brought them back to the plateau with to the finish line. They then descended from the plateau back into Cercedilla to the finish line. The stage was Fabio Aru's last chance to take back time on Tom Dumoulin; before the stage Alasdair Fotheringham wrote on \"Cyclingnews.com\" that the race was still \"too close to call\".\nThe stage again began with a contest to get into the day's breakaway. Eventually a group of ten riders formed. These were Rubén Plaza (Lampre–Mérida), Adam Hansen (Lotto–Soudal), Jaco Venter (MTN-Qhubeka), Larry Warbasse (IAM Cycling), Daniel Navarro (Cofidis), Jay McCarthy (Tinkoff–Saxo), José Gonçalves (Caja Rural-Seguros), Eduard Vorganov (Katusha), Moreno Moser (Cannondale–Garmin), Miguel Ángel Rubiano (Colombia) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). 29 more riders escaped from the peloton and chased the leaders. At the top of the first climb, the lead group had a minute's lead, with a further five minutes to the peloton. On the second climb, Plaza attacked alone and built a lead of over two minutes. The two groups behind came together to form a 38-rider chase group. Plaza by this point was 13 minutes ahead of the peloton. His lead to the chasing group fell on the way to the third climb of the day, but then rose again on the climb to reach three minutes. Plaza's lead was nearly two minutes at the top of the final climb and he held on to take the stage victory. Gonçalves and Alessandro De Marchi (Lotto–Soudal) broke away from the rest of the group and took second and third places respectively, over a minute behind Plaza. Plaza's solo effort started from the finish line and lasted for more than three hours.\nAstana moved to the head of the main peloton after the second climb of the day. Although Dumoulin was still in the group, he had lost most of his teammates. Astana then attacked with remaining on the third climb: Mikel Landa attacked first; Aru followed him and was joined by Quintana and Rafał Majka. Dumoulin was dropped but was then able to ride back to the group. By this point the group contained just eight riders: Landa, Aru, Quintana, Majka, Dumoulin, Rodríguez, Chaves and Mikel Nieve (Sky). Towards the summit, Dumoulin and Nieve were dropped. Dumoulin attempted to ride back to the group on the descent and flat; Aru, however, had three teammates in the group (Luis León Sánchez and Andrey Zeits had dropped back from the early breakaway) and they were able to defend their lead. On the final climb, Quintana and Majka attacked and gained over a minute's lead ahead of the rest of the group; they were assisted by Andrey Amador, Quintana's teammate, who had also been in the breakaway. Rodríguez rode hard at the front of the group to defend his overall position. Quintana and Majka finished around 50\" ahead of Rodríguez, Aru and Chaves. Dumoulin finished nearly four minutes further back. Aru therefore moved into the race lead, with Rodríguez in second and Majka third. Dumoulin dropped to sixth place.\nAru said after the stage that he had been able to tell that Dumoulin was tired. He paid particular credit to his teammates who had encouraged him to attack from a long way out. Dumoulin said that he had been \"just empty\" before he was dropped on the Morcuera. Plaza's stage victory was described as \"extraordinary\" and \"epic\" by \"Cycling Weekly\"; he said after the climb that he knew the climbs well and had intended to ride all the way to the finish when he made his initial attack. The stage victory was his second in the Vuelta (following a time-trial win in 2005) and also his second Grand Tour stage of the season, after he also won a stage of the 2015 Tour de France.\nStage 21.\n13 September 2015 — Alcalá de Henares to Madrid, \nThe final stage of the 2015 Vuelta was short and flat. It began with a section of flat roads that took the riders from Alcalá de Henares to a finishing circuit in the centre of Madrid. The finishing circuit itself was in length, including four sharp corners. The final corner, a hairpin turn, came with a little over to the finish line. The riders rode ten complete laps of the circuit; the stage was in total. The stage was almost entirely flat. The stage took place in the evening and was intended to be a festive conclusion to the Vuelta.\nThe first part of the stage was not ridden competitively. At the end of the first complete lap was the day's intermediate sprint. Joaquim Rodríguez had suffered a puncture immediately before the sprint and Alejandro Valverde, who had been two points behind him in the points classification, took the four points available at the lead of the competition. Rodríguez said after the stage that he was angry that Valverde had taken the green jersey from him when the final stage was meant to be a party; the two riders were known not to get on, following an incident at the 2013 world championships road race. After the sprint, six riders formed a breakaway. These were Ben King (Cannondale–Garmin), Matteo Montaguti (Ag2r–La Mondiale), Omar Fraile (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Laurent Pichon (FDJ), Carlos Verona (Etixx–Quick-Step) and Giovanni Visconti (Movistar). Their lead never exceeded 30\" and they were caught on the penultimate lap. Despite further attacks, the peloton stayed together and the stage ended in a bunch sprint.\nGiant-Alpecin's lead-out train included Tom Dumoulin and they took over at the front of the peloton with to the finish line. The team gave John Degenkolb a perfect lead-out; although Degenkolb started sprinting early, he was able to take the victory by a large margin over Danny van Poppel to take his first stage victory of the 2015 Vuelta. Jempy Drucker (BMC) finished third. Aru was behind a split in the peloton and lost 20\" to Rodríguez; nevertheless, he took the overall victory in the Vuelta by 57\". Degenkolb said after the stage that the victory meant a lot following Dumoulin's loss of the overall lead on the previous stage and that the team would leave Spain with \"positive feelings\"."

The Huskies, led by thirty first year head coach Geno Auriemma, won the NCAA tournament and went undefeated. With their eleventh championship win in 2016, the UConn Huskies became the first NCAA Division I women's basketball team to win four straight national championships.\nMedia.\nEvery single Connecticut game was expected to be televised. Excluding exhibitions, every Connecticut home game and most conference games aired on SNY with a simulcast on Husky Vision. Select games aired on ESPN3, another ESPN Network, or CBS Sports Network. Every game was once again broadcast on the UConn IMG Sports Network with an extra audio broadcast being available online to listen to through Husky Vision.\nOff-season.\nFIBA Americas U16 Championship.\nAndra Espinoza-Hunter, who has committed to play for Connecticut in 2017, played for the USA team at the 2015 FIBA Americas U16 Championship held in Puebla, Mexico. Espinoza-Hunter plays for Blair Academy, but had previously played for Ossining High School where she was a teammate of Saniya Chong. The USA team won their preliminary games, but lost in the semifinals to Brazil. They defeated the host team, Mexico, to earn the bronze medal. In the bronze medal game, Espinoza-Hunter scored ten points, one of four players in double figures.\nFIBA Under-19 World Championship for Women.\nUConn commits Napheesa Collier and Crystal Dangerfield both played at the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Championship for Women, held in Chekhov, Russia from 8 to 26 July 2015. The USA team won all seven games to win the gold medal. In the semi-final against Spain, Collier had 24 points on 10 of 13 shooting from the field. Collier was named to the five player all-tournament squad.\nPan Am games.\nThree UConn players participated in basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada July 10 to 26, 2015. Breanna Stewart and Moriah Jefferson played for the USA team, while Kia Nurse played for the Canadian team.\nCanada opened the preliminary rounds with an easy 101–38 win over Venezuela. The following day they beat Argentina 73–58. The final preliminary game was against Cuba; both teams were 2–0, so the winner would win the group. The game went down to the wire with Canada eking out a 71–68 win. Canada would face Brazil in the semifinal.\nEverything seemed to go right in the semifinal game. Canada opened the game with an 11–2 run on seven consecutive points by Miranda Ayim. Miah-Marie Langlois contributed five assists. In the third quarter Canada strongly out rebounded Brazil and hit 69% of their field goals to score 33 points in the quarter. Lizanne Murphy and Nirra Fields hit three-pointers to help extend the lead to 68–39 at the end of three quarters. Canada continued to dominate in the fourth quarter with three-pointers by Nurse and Kim Gaucher. Canada went on to win the game 91–63 to earn a spot in the gold-medal game against the USA.\nThe gold-medal game matched up the host team Canada against USA, in a sold-out arena dominated by fans in red and white and waving the Canadian flag. The Canadian team, arm in arm, sang \"Oh Canada\" as the respective national anthems were played.\nAfter trading baskets early the US edged out to a double-digit lead in the second quarter. However the Canadians, spurred on by the home crowd cheering, fought back and tied up the game at halftime. In the third quarter, it was Canada's time to shine as they outscore the US 26–15. The lead would reach as high as 18 points. The USA would fight back, but not all the way and Canada won the game and the gold-medal 81–73. It was Canada's first gold-medal in basketball in the Pan Am games. Kia Nurse was the star for Canada with 33 points, hitting 11 of her 12 free-throw attempts in 10 of her 17 field-goal attempts including two of three three-pointers.\nStewart was the leading scorer for the US in the gold-medal game with 17 points. She recorded a double double with 11 rebounds to go along with her points. Jefferson was the third leading scorer for the USA team with 14 points.\nFIBA Americas Women's Championship 2015.\nNurse played for Canada at the 2015 FIBA Americas Women's Championship, a qualifying event used to determine invitations to the 2016 Olympics. The games were held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in August, 2015. Canada was assigned to Group A and played Puerto Rico, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Cuba in the preliminary rounds. Canada won the first three games easily with a 94–57 win over Puerto Rico is the closest match. The final preliminary round game was against undefeated Cuba, a team Canada had faced in the Pan Am games. Cuba played well in that event and was expected to challenge Canada. However, Canada defeated Cuba 92–43 to win first place in the group for a spot in the semifinal against the second-place team in group B, Brazil. Nurse was the leading scorer for Canada with 14 points in the game.\nThe semifinal game against Brazil was much closer. Canada led by only six points at halftime but gradually expanded the lead to end up with an 83–66 win, and a spot in the gold-medal game. With teammate Shona Thorburn sidelined with an injury, Nurse played 35 minutes, the most of any player on the team. The gold-medal game was a rematch with Cuba who won their semifinal game against Argentina. Despite the lopsided result in the preliminary rounds, Canada expected a closer game. Cuba started off strong and had an eight-point lead early in the game. Canada responded with a 16–0 run to take over the lead, but Cuba responded and took a small lead early in the second half. Then Canada took the lead back and gradually expanded the lead to end up with the win, 82–66. As the game wound down to the close, the crowd was chanting \"Rio\",\"Rio\",\"Rio\" in recognition of the fact that the win qualifies Canada for the Olympics in Rio in 2016. Nurse was the leading scorer for Canada with 20 points, and her overall performance earned her the MVP award for the entire event.\nRoster.\nDe'Janae Boykin was only on the roster for the fall semester, after which she transferred from UConn.\nGames.\nExhibition.\nLubbock Christian.\nThe opening exhibition game was played against the Lady Chaps from Lubbock Christian University. The Huskies trailed early, but got untracked quickly, behind 25 points from Stewart, and cruised to a 95–39 win. After the game, Auriemma went to the public address microphone to praise both the team and the fans who made the trip, saying \"Their fans were great. That’s a long way for them to travel, and they did. It was way better than a lot of exhibition games we’ve had.\"\nLubbock Christian would go on to win the Division II national title this season, completing an unbeaten season in its first year of NCAA postseason eligibility after transitioning from the NAIA.\nVanguard.\nThe game outcome was never in doubt–only the final margin of 80 points in the 98–18 win was unknown–but the interesting aspect of the game was neither the opponents nor the outcome, but the rules. The teams agreed to use experimental rules, largely following the European set of rules. This included use of a larger ball, often call the men's ball, as well as a wider lane, a 24–second shot clock, and an 8-second count to cross into the front court. The international distance of 22 feet 1 inch for the three-point line was used rather than the usual 20 feet 9 inches. The experiment was undertaken to provide information to those who might support the inclusion of the rules into regular-season playing rules.\nRegular season.\nOhio State.\nOhio's State's coach Kevin McGuff wanted to challenge his team, although circumstances created a larger challenge than he had intended. He scheduled the number two team in the country South Carolina, then was invited to participate in an early season event that included a game against the number one UConn team, which meant he had to play the number two and number one teams back to back. His team played well against South Carolina, ending up with an 88–80 loss. The result wasn't as close against the Huskies. UConn opened up early with several points, but Ohio State responded, cutting the lead to just three points late in the first quarter; the Huskies then took over. UConn led 50–24 at the half and ended up with 100 points against 56 for Ohio State. Both Stewart and Jefferson scored over 20 points with Stewart scoring 24 and Jefferson scoring 21.\nKansas State.\nThe Huskies took on the Kansas State Wildcats in the second game, on the 30th anniversary of Geno Auriemma's first game, a win against Iona. Breanna Stewart was the leading scorer with 25 points, one of which helped her reach the 2000 career point plateau, making her the 10th all-time scoring leader at UConn. The Huskies led throughout the game, and won by a margin of 40 points, 97–57.\nNebraska.\nFor the first time on the season, UConn found itself trailing. It was very early in the game, but Nebraska had a 7–3 lead. The lead did not last long. Stewart hit her first nine baskets and ended up with 25 points. She also recorded 10 rebounds, three assists, and three blocked shots, helping the Huskies dominate the Huskers and cruise to an 88–46 win.\nChattanooga.\nUConn played Chattanooga at their home court on 30 November. At the time Chattanooga was coached by Jim Foster, who as the head coach of the St. Joseph's women's basketball team in 1978 had hired Geno Auriemma as an assistant, Auriemma's first coaching position. Almost 40 years later, Jim Foster asked Auriemma for a chance to play Connecticut. The game itself was notable for the defense; the Huskies held Chattanooga to 31 points. The game was reasonably close early on. Queen Alford hit a three-pointer early in the third quarter to cut Chattanooga's deficit to only 11, at 37–26, but the Mocs would only manage one more score in the quarter. Connecticut went on a 23–2 run to extend the lead to 32 points, ultimately winning by a score of 79–31.\nDePaul.\nUConn faced DePaul, a team they had regularly played when both were in the Big East; it was now an out-of-conference game. DePaul came into the game ranked # 23 and having won their prior two games by a combined margin of almost 100 points. DePaul's coach Doug Bruno used hockey style subbing, taking out all five players and sending in five new players, to keep the players fresh. DePaul is a proficient three-point shooting team, and hit six of their first twelve three-point attempts. UConn led by seven at one point, but the Blue Demons came back to take a one-point lead 34–33. The Huskies led at the half, but only by three points, 44–41. The game remained close until Katie Lou Samuelson, who had hardly played in the first three quarters, came in and scored ten points in the final quarter to help put the game out of reach. UConn won the game 86–70.\nNotre Dame.\nThe next game, against Notre Dame, represented a rematch of the two teams in the prior year's national championship game. Playing without Taya Reimer and Briana Turner, Notre Dame opted for a guard-oriented, perimeter offense. They tied a school record with 13 three-pointers in the game. Marina Mabrey scored 21 points in the first half for the Irish. UConn's Jefferson announced at halftime she would guard Mabrey in the second half, and Mabrey subsequently only scored two points in the half. Stewart was the leading scorer with 28 points, but Tuck had 21 points, along with eight assists and seven rebounds. The Huskies won by ten points, 91–81.\nColgate.\nAuriemma likes to schedule a game near the home town of seniors. The logical choice for Syracuse native Stewart would be Syracuse, but they declined, so an arrangement was made to play nearby Colgate. The small arena (capacity 1,782) was sold out for the event. The Raiders were unable to keep up with the Huskies, but did manage to accomplish something that recent opponents had exploited, namely, hitting three-pointers. Colgate's Paige Kriftcher had a total of nine three-pointers in her first six games, but went 7 for 8 on the evening. However, the rest of the team was unable to match her performance, and the team scored 50 points to Uconn's 94. Stewart performed well in the game before friends and family, hitting seven of her nine shot attempts for 22 points. Her ten assists gave her a double-double, and she also had seven rebounds, four steals, and two blocks.\nFlorida State.\nUConn faced Florida State in the Hall of Fame Women's Showcase played at the Mohegan Sun Arena. The Seminoles were ranked #11, and came in with a seven-game winning streak. However, the Huskies had a balanced offense, led by Tuck with 18 points, and Stewart with 16, Jefferson with 15, and Nurse with 14; the quartet was more than enough to counter Florida State. The Huskies hit almost 56% of their shot attempts, and went on to win their 45th consecutive game 73–49.\nLSU.\nLSU came to Hartford to play UConn at the XL center. Both teams were playing with shortened rosters. The Huskies' Butler had not played yet, following thumb surgery; she was expected to be ready in December, but still had not yet played. Chong had suffered IT band issues with her legs and was unable to play. Stewart sustained an ankle injury in practice, and was held out as a precaution. However, LSU also had several players out. Both Raigyne Moncrief and Ayana Mitchell had season ending surgery; coach Nikki Fargas held an open tryout to add players, and chose Constance Quinn, a softball player. Unfortunately, playing UConn short-handed with new players is not a recipe for success. Even with some of the Huskies being sidelined, UConn played solid defense, holding LSU scoreless for a six-minute stretch at one time, and held them to just under 26% field goal shooting. The Huskies won easily, 86–40.\nMaryland.\nConnecticut and Maryland played in the Maggie Dixon Classic, held in Madison Square Garden. The Terrapins were ranked sixth in the polls, but the Huskies started out strong, opening up a seven-point lead at the end of the first quarter. Maryland responded in the second quarter, first tying the game at 21 points apiece, then taking a lead 29–27. With two minutes to go in the half, Maryland held a slim, three-point lead, but the Huskies scored the last seven points of the half to go into halftime up 36–34.\nConnecticut continued the run in the opening minutes of the second half, scoring the first four points of the period, but Maryland responded, and retook the lead. The Huskies responded as well, retook the lead, and extended it to twelve points. The Terrapins chipped away at the lead, and cut it to four points with just over a minute to go in the game, when Chong, playing for the first time in four games, nailed a three-pointer to extend the lead to seven. Maryland's Brionna Jones would hit 12 of her 14 field goal attempts and score 22 points, but it was not enough. Maryland would make one more basket, but five three throws by Connecticut extended the final margin to double digits, and a win 81–71.\nCincinnati (away).\nThe next game was against Cincinnati, coached by former UConn player and coach Jamelle Elliott. Despite the relationship, Auriemma did not ease up on the Bearcats. Eight Huskies scored in double digits, and UConn went on to win the game easily, 107–45. The game was notable for factors other than the outcome. Uconn's Natalie Butler had transferred from Georgetown, and so had sat out the required full year, but then had a thumb injury, requiring surgery and rehabilitation. She finally got to play, nearly 18 months after her last game. She did not take long to make her presence known, scoring 21 seconds after entering the game. She ended up with eleven points, hitting five of her seven shots, recording, eight rebounds, blocking two shots. The other notable event was that Stewart, who had passed Diana Taurasi on the UConn scoring list the previous Monday, scored enough to pass Kalena Mosqueda Lewis, Nykesha Sales and Kerry Bascom. She moved to third on UConn's all-time scoring list, trailing only Tina Charles and Maya Moore.\nTulsa (home).\nJefferson did not play in the game against Tulsa, due to a hamstring injury. She had played in all 129 previous games, and had recorded 90 consecutive starts. Chong, still recovering from a leg injury, started in her place, and scored a season-high 18 points. Tuck also scored 18 points, 16 in the first half. The Huskies shot just over 50% from the field and held the Golden Hurricane to under 27%. UConn won its 49th consecutive game 95–35.\nHouston.\nHouston had only four wins against ten losses when they started their game against UConn; no one gave them a legitimate shot at a win. A very early small lead wasn't a surprise, but the lead grew to seven points in the first quarter, giving some hope to the Houston fans in attendance. Even though Houston led at the end of the first quarter, the Huskies had started a 15–0 run that would take back the lead. Although the Cougars would manage a 5–0 run at the end of that run, the Huskies settled down, put together another run (11–0) in the third period and ended with a win 76–37. Tuck did not play with soreness in her leg. Jefferson had missed the prior game, but was back in the line-up. Butler had seven rebounds in her third game back after recovering from thumb surgery.\nSouth Florida (away).\nSouth Florida was the only other ranked team in the American Conference. The game in Tampa started out promisingly for the Bulls, as Kitija Laksa, who had scored 38 points in her previous game, hit her first two three-pointers of the game to give the Bulls an 8–2 lead. They extended the lead to eight points at 14–6, but Stewart and Nurse ht threes to start a 14–1 run by the Huskies to retake the lead. The Bulls cut the lead to a single point in the third quarter on two more threes by Laksa, but UConn responded with seven straight points. In the fourth quarter, Jefferson, Tuck and Samuelson each hit a three in the opening two minutes of the quarter to open up the lead to 18. Although South Florida would cut a 21-point lead to 12 later in the period, they would not get any closer and UConn finished with their 51st consecutive win, 75–59.\nMemphis (away).\nDespite winning by large margins at Houston and South Florida, the Huskies started out slowly in each game, trailing at the end of the first quarter against Houston, and by eight points to South Florida in the first quarter. In the game against Memphis, the team started out better, leading 11–4 early, and scoring 13 consecutive points shortly thereafter. The lead reached 20 points before the end of the quarter. Jefferson had noticed a tendency to shoot with her elbow out, corrected the motion, and hit seven of her eight field goal attempts, leading to a team high 21 points. UConn went on to win 86–46.\nTemple (home).\nPlaying in only its second game on campus for the season, Samuelson got her second start of the year. She responded by scoring 21 points, a new career high, along with six assists. Her coach noted she had been playing better in games as well as in practices. As a 6' 3\" guard, she also opened up the middle of the floor for Stewart, as the Owls needed to guard Samuelson on the perimeter. Stewart hit nine of her eleven field goals attempts and scored 22. The score was tied at five points apiece when the Huskies scored 24 consecutive points. The team hit almost 55% of their field goal attempts, and tied a season high with 13 three-pointers, leading to 104 points, while holding Temple to 49.\nUCF.\nUConn played Central Florida without Tuck, who was out for two weeks to rest a sore knee. Six different players reached double figures, including Natalie Butler, who scored 20 points on nine of eleven shooting, the highest point total in her UConn career. She played without her bandage for the first time this year. Williams had 19 points, while hitting nine of eleven shots. Jefferson was questionable, following a knee and head injury in practice, but played 21 minutes. The Huskies won 106–51.\nSMU (away).\nDallas native Jefferson scored 19 points in home of a home crowd court. Stewart just missed a triple double, with 15 points, 12 rebounds and 9 blocks, while playing only 26 minutes. The Huskies hit over 50% of their shots, while holding the Mustangs to 25% shooting. UConn won 90–37, their 55th consecutive win, breaking a tie with Louisiana Tech for the third longest winning streak in NCAA DI women's basketball (Connecticut holds the first and second places, at 90 and 70 respectively).\nTulsa (away).\nConnecticut held Tulsa to just three points in the opening quarter, and the game result was never in doubt. The Huskies outscored the Golden Hurricane by 64 points to win 94–30, but the win wasn't the story of the day—Stewart came into the game with 997 career rebounds and reached the 1,000 career rebound level. She is one of only six Huskies to score at least 1,000 points and record 1,000 rebounds in her career.\nMemphis (home).\nIn the game against Memphis, five Huskies scored in double digits, led by Stewart's 19 points. UConn recorded assists on 25 of their 32 baskets, hit 58% of their field goal attempts, as well as all ten free throws. The 19 turnovers was one of the few \"downsides\" in the box score, as Connecticut won their 57th consecutive game 83–40.\nTulane (away).\nThe Huskies took on Tulane at their arena. Stewart, who was only 16 points away from second place (held by Tina Charles) on the Huskies all-time scoring list. She scored the first six points of the game and scored or recorded an assist on nine of the twelve baskets scored in the quarter. She reached second place on two free throws late in the first half. Tulane had the second best defense in the conference, holding teams to under 61 points in a game. The Huskies scored 63 by halftime. Tuck played in the game after missing four games with knee soreness, with eleven points and five rebounds in 16 minutes of play. The Huskies defeated the Green Wave 96–38.\nEast Carolina (home).\nConnecticut played at Gampel Arena for only the third time for the season, taking on East Carolina. Nurse, who had been scoreless in the previous game, scored a season-high 20 points as the Huskies defeated the Pirates 92–46. Briana Pulido made a steal near midcourt, which led to a lay-up late in the game.\nSouth Carolina.\nThe match-up between Connecticut and South Carolina featured the top two teams in the country. The two teams had met the previous year, in Storrs, ranked first and second, although South Carolina was the number one team at the time. Coach Auriemma compared the ascendance of the Gamecocks to the path of the 1995 UConn team, which went on to win the national championship, noting that in some ways, the South Carolina team was further along in its development. The game was played in front of a sell-out crowd of 18,000 fans, some of whom were lined up by noon to get in to the seven o'clock game. The Gamecocks were expected to take advantage of their strong frontcourt duo of A'ja Wilson and Alaina Coates, but Tuck's defense against Coates limited her to only two points. Tuck scored 16 points herself, Stewart added 25, and Jefferson \"tired out the Gamecocks guards with her relentlessness\". The Huskies opened up an early lead, never trailed, and extended the lead to 21 points. The final score favored Connecticut 66–54. It was the 22nd meeting between teams ranked one and two in which Connecticut played; they moved to 19–3 in such games.\nTemple (away).\nThe second game of the season against Temple, this time at their arena, turned out very differently than the first match-up. The Owls stole the ball 14 times, and even had a lead in the second quarter. The Huskies pulled out to a 10-point lead at halftime, and cut the lead to six midway through the third quarter before UConn extended the lead out to double digits and then eventually to 25 points. Williams hit all nine of her field-goal attempts. Jefferson had 25 points while Stewart had 24. The final score was 85–60.\nCincinnati (home).\nCoach Auriemma had been concerned that the three seniors on the team were playing so well that the remainder of the team would tend to defer to them too much. While some of the bench players were getting substantial playing time, it was often when the lead was substantial. Auriemma decided to shake things up by using a starting lineup without any of the three seniors. Although the new lineup had an early 15–7 lead, the score was tied at 15 apiece late in the first quarter, when Auriemma brought in the seniors. The Bearcats scored 19 points in the first quarter, but would only score 15 more points in the remainder of the game. The Huskies won 88–34. Natalie Butler, in her first start as a Husky, recorded a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds.\nEast Carolina (away).\nUConn traveled to North Carolina for their last game out of state prior to a possible Final Four game. They played East Carolina, who had been expected to do well in conference but had suffered devastating injuries and were only able to dress seven for the game. Samuelson hit several three-pointers early, scoring 15 points in the first quarter. With the Huskies up by 20 points at the end of the first quarter, the outcome was never in doubt. Stewart had eight blocks, only two away from notching a triple-double for the evening. She moved to second place on the all-time list for UConn behind only Rebecca Lobo with 396 career blocks. The Huskies beat the Pirates 84–41.\nSMU (home).\nThe game against SMU was close for the first few minutes, but the Huskies then opened up a lead they would never relinquish. Tuck did not wear her knee brace and scored 10 points. Samuelson tied her season-high with 21 points. UConn went on to win their 64th consecutive game and their 58th consecutive AAC game, 88–41.\nTulane (home).\nThe game against Tulane was designated as Senior Day, a day when the seniors for the team were honored in pregame ceremonies. The four seniors, Breanna Stewart, Mariah Jefferson, Morgan Tuck, and Brianna Pulido, walked out onto the floor with family members and were given a framed memento including their jersey. The event was a sellout. In addition to honoring the seniors, the day is traditionally the day that members of the Huskies of Honor are announced. This year ceremonies included Stewart and Jefferson, both of whom had attained the first-team All-America status, as well as Chris Dailey, the associate head coach.\nTraditionally, the seniors are designated starters on this day. Though three of the four seniors were regular starters, this game marked Briana Pulido's first start. Fresh from the emotions of the senior day festivities, the team started slower than normal. Tulane was up 13–2 at one point, the first time for the year the Huskies trailed by a double-digit margin. Soon thereafter, the team regained its bearings and ended up with an 80–40 win over the Green Wave. Samuelson hit six three-pointers and scored 21 points for the second straight time. Stewart struggled in the first half but ended up with a double-double — 20 points and 12 rebounds.\nSouth Florida (home).\nUConn found itself in unfamiliar territory, as they went into the halftime break trailing by a single point to South Florida. They had not trailed at the halftime on the season — the last time had been the 2015 NCAA tournament regional semifinal against Dayton. Whether it was good defense or poor offense, both teams were shooting 28% from the field in the first half. In the third quarter the Huskies scored 32 points, 16 of which came from Stewart, who single-handedly outscored the Bulls in the third quarter. South Florida's Courtney Williams scored 15 points in the first half, helping the Bulls take a one-point lead, but did not score in the third quarter. UConn won the final regular-season game 79–59.\nAAC Tournament.\nEast Carolina.\nThe Huskies started out faster in this game than in their prior two games, scoring 32 points in the first quarter and holding the Pirates to 13. Five different Huskies scored in double digits, with Tuck and Samuelson each scoring 16 points. UConn hit 59% of their shots from the field and went on to win 92–51 to extend their winning streak to 67 games.\nTulane.\nUConn faced Tulane in the semifinals of the AAC tournament. The last time the two teams squared off was on senior night in the penultimate game of the regular season. In that game the Huskies missed the first 12 shots and were down by double digits for the first time in the season. This time, the game would start off differently. The Huskies hit their first nine shots and were leading 28–5 at the end of the first quarter. The large lead allowed the coach to rest the starters and give the bench plenty of time on the court. UConn ended up hitting 55% of the shots and finished with the win, 82–35.\nSouth Florida.\nOne week before, South Florida lead UConn at the half in the final game of the regular season. The two teams met again in the American Athletic Conference championship game. The Bulls also had a lead in this game, but this time they led at the end of the first quarter before falling behind and never retaking the lead. Jefferson was given the assignment of guarding Courtney Williams, the best player for South Florida, and held her to a single basket in the first half. In the second half the Huskies hit 15 of their first 19 field-goal attempts to extend the lead to 71–43. UConn won the game 77–51. Jefferson, Tuck and Samuelson were named to the all-tournament team while Stewart was named the tournament's most outstanding player.\nNCAA Tournament.\nRobert Morris.\nIt was an early start for the Huskies, both the game start at 11 AM and the scoring start with 41 points in the first quarter. The last time the Huskies lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament was 1993, before any of the current UConn players were born. They would not stop that streak this day, but would instead extend their current winning streak to 70 consecutive games, which was tied for the second longest winning streak in NCAA women's basketball history. They shared a tie with an earlier UConn streak which was second only to a 90-game UConn winning streak. Samuelson led the scorers with 22 points; Stewart had 18 points but also had three blocked shots which moved her into first place on the UConn career leaderboard for blocked shots. The final score was 101–49.\nDuquesne.\nFor a brief moment, the Duquesne Dukes were leading UConn. The score was 14–13, but the lead lasted only 17 seconds. UConn's Moriah Jefferson hit a three-pointer to start a 17–3 run, which was followed by a 22–4 run. Although the final score was lopsided 97–51, the Dukes made the Huskies work hard for the win. Stewart, Tuck, and Jefferson scored 21, 20 and 20 points respectively.\nMississippi State.\nA day after two number one seeds were upset in the Sweet 16, top-seeded Connecticut faced Mississippi State determined not to be upset themselves. The Huskies scored the first 13 points of the game, leaving little doubt regarding the outcome. At halftime, they were leading 61–12. The lead reached 68 points, and UConn was able to take out two of the starters with just under four minutes left in the third quarter. Despite setting a record for the most wins in program history with 28, the Mississippi State Bulldogs were never in the game, and ended up losing 98–38. The 60 point margin of victory established a new NCAA record in the regional rounds or beyond set by Connecticut in the previous year in a 51-point win over Texas.\nTexas.\nUConn faced Texas in the Elite Eight game. They had played Texas in a Sweet 16 game in the previous year, winning by 51 points, at the time the largest margin of victory in a Sweet 16 game. Although the teams were largely the same, the results were quite different. This year in the first quarter Texas hit three three-pointers, and was only trailing by two points. The Huskies extended the lead in the second quarter but Texas cut the lead back to five points. UConn pushed the lead to 15 points at halftime, and extended it to 21 points early in the third quarter, but Texas hit three more three-pointers and cut the lead to 12 points. UConn increased its defensive intensity and held the Longhorns to only five points over the next 5 ½ minutes. The Huskies finished the game with a 21-point margin 86–65 and headed to their ninth consecutive Final Four.\nOregon State.\nBreanna Stewart picked up her second foul with just over two minutes gone in the first quarter. Although it would not be known until halftime, Katie Lou Samuelson broke a bone in her foot in the first play the game and continue to play until halftime. Stewart continued in the game with the team switching to a zone defense, and switching her defensive responsibilities from 6’6” Ruth Hamblin to Devin Hunter. She managed to avoid picking up a third foul in the first half although it limited their ability to be aggressive. She only scored two points in the first half but transitioned from an emphasis on offense to being a ball distributor. Bench players Gabby Williams and Napheesa Collier contributed points and defense, especially in the opening half. UConn ended with an 80–51 win over Oregon State. The 29 point margin of victory is the largest margin in a national semifinal game in the second largest in Final Four history.\nSyracuse.\nUConn’s opponent in the Championship game was Syracuse, appearing in their first ever Final Four and championship game. UConn opened with the first nine points of the game. Syracuse attempted to respond with three-pointers; they had hit 12 three-pointers in their game against the Washington Huskies, but would only hit two in this game. UConn led in the third quarter 60–27 before Syracuse came back with a 16–0 run; that run still left the Huskies with a double-digit lead. In this game, Stewart did not get into foul trouble, and ended with 24 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists. Tuck had 19 points and Jefferson recorded 13 points. The final score was 82–51. This gave the UConn Huskies their 11th national championship, exceeding the 10 national championships recorded by John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins. The championship was also the fourth consecutive, marking the first time in history that a team won four consecutive championships. Stewart, Tuck, and Jefferson became the only NCAA players in history to have four national championships in their career.\nSchedule.\nThe Huskies' exhibition game with Vanguard featured several experimental rules, many of which have been advocated by head coach Auriemma:\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"| AAC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"|American Athletic Conference women's tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"|NCAA women's tournament\nWNBA draft.\nBreanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck were the first, second and third pick of the 2016 WNBA draft.

        "title": "5000 metres at the World Athletics Championships",
        "text": "The 5000 metres at the World Championships in Athletics has been contested by men since the inaugural edition in 1983 and by women since 1995. Women competed over 3000 metres from 1980 to 1993, in line with championship standards of the time. It is the shortest long-distance running event at the competition, the 10,000 metres and marathon being the other two such events on the programme. It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 5000 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has a two-race heats stage that leads directly to a final between fifteen athletes.\nThe championship records for the event are 12:52.79 minutes for men, set by Eliud Kipchoge in 2003, and 14:26.72 minutes for women, set by Hellen Obiri in 2019. The world record has never been broken or equalled at the competition by either men or women, reflecting the lack of pacemaking and athletes' more tactical approach to championship races. Similarly the women's 3000 metres world record was not improved during its 13-year history. The championship record for that event was set on its last appearance in 1993, by Yunxia Qu with a time of 8:28.71 minutes.\nThe women's 3000 m was among the first ever IAAF World Championship events as it was one of two designated events at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics (alongside women's 400 metres hurdles), which was held after the International Olympic Committee refused to add the women's event to the Olympic programme that year.\nMo Farah of Great Britain is the only athlete to win this title three times, between 2011 and 2015. Meseret Defar is the most successful female athlete of the event, having won two world championship titles and reached the medal podium five times consecutively from 2005 to 2013. Vivian Cheruiyot is the next most successful with two golds and one silver. Six other athletes have won the 5000 m championship twice: Ismael Kirui, Muktar Edris and Jakob Ingebrigtsen on the men's side, and Gabriela Szabo, Tirunesh Dibaba and Hellen Obiri on the women's side. Tatyana Dorovskikh was also a double champion in the women's 3000 m, and the only woman to win multiple medals over that distance.\nKenya is the most successful nation in the discipline, with seven wins in the men's distance and five in the women's, and has the highest medal total at 30. Ethiopia is the next best performer with six women's titles, three men's titles and 30 medals overall. Morocco, Great Britain, Romania, Ireland and Norway are the other nations to have won multiple gold medals in the 5000 m. The Soviet Union won the most 3000 m medals during its run, with two titles and four medals. China produced a medal sweep in 1993.\nEamonn Coghlan and Jakob Ingebrigtsen are the only non-African-born men to win the 5000 m.\nDoping.\nThe World Championship 5000 metres was unaffected by doping until the 2001, when men's silver medallist Ali Saïdi-Sief of Algeria failed his post-race urine test due to nandrolone traces. He was stripped of his medal. Only one other competitor has been disqualified from the 5000 m for doping: Turkey's Alemitu Bekele Degfa, whose unsuccessful run in the heats in 2011 was annulled retrospectively after biological passport irregularities.\nAmong those failing tests outside the competition was 1983 men's bronze medallist Martti Vainio, who admitted to using testosterone supplements and failed a test for steroids in 1984. Marta Domínguez, the women's runner-up in 2001 and 2003, was banned later in her career for abnormalities in her biological passport readings. Additionally, 2023 silver medalist Mohamed Katir was suspended in February 2024 for whereabouts failures.\nIn the women's 3000 m, no athletes were banned during World Championships competition but 1983 medallist Tatyana Kazankina ended her career in 1984 by refusing a drug test, while the 1987 and 1991 world champion for the distance Tetyana Dorovskikh also ended her career with a drugs ban in 1993. The 1983 women's champion Mary Decker was another banned for doping later in her career.\nFinishing times.\nTop ten fastest world championships times (5000 metres)"

        "text": "John Norman Bear (8 August 1944 – 17 March 2007) was a Canadian professional snooker player.\nCareer.\nBorn in Kinistino, Saskatchewan in 1944, Bear spent much of his childhood in Flin Flon where he learned how to play pool as a child and became a hustler.\nIn 1979, he turned professional, entering his first tournament at the 1979 Canadian Open, where he beat Bernie Mikkelsen 5–3 before losing in the second round 7–9 to the young Englishman Joe Johnson. He beat Mikkelsen again in the Canadian Professional Championship of that year by 9 frames to 4, having at one stage led 7–0, but lost his semi-final match 3–9 to Cliff Thorburn. Bear's first attempt at the World Championship resulted in a 5–9 loss in the last 48 to fellow countryman Jim Wych.\nThe following season, Bear entered only the Canadian Open, defeating R. Tammett 9–4 before exiting at the last 16 stage, 4–9 to Terry Griffiths. He recorded a 118 break, the highest of his career and first of only two competitive centuries, in his win over Tammett.\nThe 1981–82 season was similar, but this time, Bear's only event was the 1982 World Championship. Fellow Canadians Cliff Thorburn, Bill Werbeniuk and Kirk Stevens were among the world's top players at this time, and Bear faced two matches in order to play alongside them at the Crucible Theatre. His first was a 9–4 defeat of Frank Jonik, and in the second, he was victorious by the same scoreline over Wych, securing himself a meeting with Werbeniuk in the last 32. Having held Werbeniuk to 2–4 and later recovered from 2–7 to 6–8, Bear eventually lost the match 7–10. Uniquely, each of his three matches in 1982 were between two Canadian players. He did not progress to the main stages of the World Championship again.\nThe only tournament Bear entered the following season was the 1983 World Championship; here, he was unable to repeat his feats of the previous year, losing at the first attempt 7–10 to Paul Medati.\nIn the 1983 Canadian Professional Championship, Bear was defeated 5–9 in the quarter-finals by his brother Jim; the final event he entered as a professional was the 1985 edition, where he beat Mario Morra 5–4 before losing 3–6 to Wych.\nWell-respected in his local community and in the world of pool, Bear died on 17 March 2007 at Royal Jubilee Hospital, aged 62."

        "text": "Kimberly Williams (born October 14, 1974) is a former professional basketball player who played two seasons for the Utah Starzz of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).\nEarly life and college career.\nBorn and raised in South Side, Chicago, Williams graduated from Marshall High School in 1993 and was Illinois \"Ms. Basketball\" as a senior.\nShe helped guide the Westark Community College (now University of Arkansas-Fort Smith) to back-to-back appearances in the NJCAA Women's Basketball Championship. The team were national runner-us in 1994 and won the national championship in 1995, going 67–2 cumulatively in Williams' two seasons. She was the first women's basketball player from Arkansas-Fort Smith to be drafted in the WNBA.\nWilliams transferred to DePaul University, where she played from 1995 to 1997. As a senior at DePaul in 1996–97, Williams was Conference USA Player of the Year after scoring 25.1 points per game, second highest nationally, and leading C-USA in assists (5.6 apg) and steals (4.52 spg).\nProfessional career.\nDrafted in the fourth round (28th overall) by the Utah Starzz in the 1997 WNBA draft, Williams played her debut game on June 21, 1997 in a 61 - 73 loss to the Sacramento Monarchs and recorded 6 points, 3 rebounds and 1 steal. Williams played 58 games in her first two seasons (both with Utah), and averaged 7.8 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 1.8 assists.\nWNBA Comeback Attempts.\nAfter her sophomore season in 1998, Williams never played in the WNBA again, but she did sign multiple contracts amongst different teams from 1999 - 2002. On April 6, 1999, the Minnesota Lynx selected Williams third overall in the 1999 WNBA expansion draft, but Williams was waived two months later on June 8 and never played for the Lynx. \nAfter not being signed by any team and missing the 2000 season entirely, she was signed by the Cleveland Rockers on April 30, 2001. However she was waived a week later on May 8 and went on to miss the entire 2001 season as well.\nOn April 30, 2002, Williams signed a contract with the Los Angeles Sparks but was waived two weeks later before the season started on May 13. And once again, she was not signed by another team and missed the entire 2002 season. After 2002, she did not attempt a WNBA comeback again. And thus, her final WNBA game ever was played on August 17, 1998 in a 64 - 75 loss to the Phoenix Mercury where she recorded 2 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assist and 1 steal on 11% FG shooting (1-11 FG).\nCareer in Other Leagues.\nFollowing the 1998 WNBA season, Williams played overseas, beginning with Sporting in Greece from 1998 to 1999, followed by Holon in Israel from 1999 to 2000 and Fiskobirlik in Turkey from 2000 to 2001.\nIn 2004, Williams returned to the United States with the Chicago Blaze of the National Women's Basketball League, playing two seasons. \nWilliams played in Europe and Israel from 2004 to 2014, most recently with Dynamo Kyiv from 2012 to 2014. Williams left Ukraine as military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine began.\nWilliams signed with the Chicago Lady Steam of the Women's American Basketball Association in 2014. She returned to DePaul University later that year to finish her bachelor's degree."

        "text": "The 2015 Vuelta a España was the 70th edition of the race. It was the last of cycling's three Grand Tours to take place during the 2015 road cycling season. The race started in Marbella on 22 August and finished in Madrid on 13 September; three days were in Andorra, including the whole of stage 11 and the first of the race's two rest days.\nAll 17 UCI World Tour teams were automatically entitled to start the race. In March 2015, five UCI Professional Continental teams were awarded wildcard places in the race by the organisers, Unipublic. As each team was entitled to enter nine riders, the peloton at the beginning of the first stage consisted of 198 riders. The riders came from 37 countries; France, Spain and Italy all had 20 or more riders in the race. The startlist included all of the top four riders from the 2015 Tour de France: Chris Froome (), Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde (both ), and Vincenzo Nibali (). The riders had an average age of 29.13 years: the oldest rider to start the race was 38-year-old Haimar Zubeldia () and the youngest was 20-year-old Matej Mohorič ().\nAt the end of the final stage, there were 158 riders left in the race, with 40 riders failing to finish. Froome and Nibali were both among the riders who left the race before it reached Madrid: Froome abandoned the race after breaking his foot on stage 11; Nibali was disqualified after receiving illegal assistance from his team car during stage 2. The race was won by Fabio Aru (Astana). He first took the red jersey (indicating the lead of the general classification) following the mountainous stage 11. He lost it first to Joaquim Rodríguez () on the uphill finish of stage 16, then to Tom Dumoulin () in the individual time trial on stage 17. Aru was six seconds behind Dumoulin going into the penultimate stage of the race; an attack on the final climb of the Vuelta dropped Dumoulin and Aru was able to take the overall victory in the race. Rodríguez finished second, 57 seconds behind Aru, with Rafał Majka () a further 12 seconds behind in third. Valverde won the points classification and Rodríguez the combination classification. The mountains classification was won by Omar Fraile (). Movistar won the team classification.\nTeams.\nThe 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited to participate in the Vuelta.

        "text": "The women's 20 kilometres walk at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 28 August.\nSummary.\nThe defending champion Elena Lashmanova would not be here, while she serves her drug suspension. In fact the entire Russian team did not compete here amid the drug scandal surrounding their coach Viktor Chegin. It looked like world record holder, world leader Liu Hong, walking on home soil was the prohibitive favorite. Liu's one complication was her teammate Xiuzhi Lu. Like in the men's race, the two Chinese walkers took off hard from the start, only Anežka Drahotová tried to go with them. That lasted about 4 km, from that point on the two walkers were out on their own almost tied by a string, swapping the lead occasionally though Lu was setting the pace the majority of the time. They hit 5K in 22:24; 10K in 44:19 (21:55 split) with a 30-second lead and 15K in 1:06:24 (22:05 split). The chase pack was Lyudmyla Olyanovska, Elisa Rigaudo, Eleonora Giorgi and Érica de Sena. de Sena was the first to fall off pace around 12K, both of the Italians were later asked to leave the course. Between 10 and 15K the lead actually shrunk to 20 seconds, but the closing 5K in 21:22 settled it for everyone but the two Chinese walkers. They battled neck and neck until just about the time they re-entered the stadium, when Lu seemed to concede to Liu and walked the remainder on the track in her footsteps. With the domestic crowd going crazy, Lu crossed the finish line virtually in Liu's shadow, the separation .26 of a second for the closest finish for a race walk in World Championships history. Because it is a road course, the official times are only accurate to one second so both athlete's times round to the same time. Olyanovska continued to hold on, finishing just 28 seconds back for bronze. The rest of the field finished more than 1:15 behind her.\nIt was the first gold medal for the home team at these championships.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nThe race was started at 08:30."

        "text": "Jose Luis Fernandez (born November 18, 1971) is the head coach of the University of South Florida women's basketball team, starting in 2000.\nFernandez was officially named head coach on Nov. 14, 2000, just seven months after arriving at USF as an assistant coach. He has led the Bulls to eight trips to the NCAA Tournament and nine WNIT appearances, which includes the 2009 WNIT title and a semifinal appearance in 2014. The Bulls have also advanced to the American Athletic Conference (AAC) Tournament championship game in six of the past nine seasons and have made at least the semifinal round during every season in the AAC.\nNamed the 2018 and 2021 American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, head coach Jose Fernandez has, during his 20-plus seasons, built the Bulls into a perennial Top 25 program. Under his guidance, USF has transformed from a program with only five winning seasons to a regular participant in the NCAA Tournament.\nDuring the 2020–21 campaign, the Green and Gold made program history winning its first American Athletic Conference regular-season championship and followed that up with The American Tournament title in Fort Worth, Texas. During their tournament run, the Bulls defeated Wichita State, 48–44, Tulane, 51–47, and rival UCF, 64–54, the same Knights team that USF beat, 65–52, to win the regular-season crown on March 2 in the Yuengling Center.\nSeason by season results.\n2023-24\nSouth Florida finished the 2023–24 campaign 19–14 and 10–8 in league play. The 19 overall wins marked Fernandez’s 13th straight and 17th total 19-win season, while it’s the 10th time and fifth straight year the Bulls have collected 10-or more regular season conference victories.\nThe duo of Vittoria Blasigh and Romi Levy were recognized as two of the top players in the American with postseason accolades. Blasigh was tabbed the AAC Freshman of the Year and Levy earned AAC Newcomer of the Year, All-Conference second team, and All-Newcomer team honors. Blasigh is the fifth freshman in program history (fourth Bull in AAC history) to earn the honor, Levy is the second USF performer to earn Newcomer of the Year honors, following Sammie Puisis (2022–23) in back-to-back seasons.\n2022–23 (NCAA Tournament)\nIn 2022–23 South Florida posted a 27–7 overall record and held a 15–1 mark in conference action, which earned the squad the regular season title. The 2022–23 campaign was concluded on a high note, as the program made its ninth appearance in the NCAA Tournament, marking its eighth trip to the Big Dance in the last 11 years.\nIncluded in their 27 wins were ranked victories against No. 22/18 Texas, 70-65, a gritty 66-65 overtime win versus No. 17/19 Arkansas in the San Diego Invitational, and a 67-65, comeback overtime triumph against ninth-seeded Marquette in the first round of March Madness. The season came to an end in the following round, as No. 1/1 South Carolina bested the Bulls, 76-45.\nElena Tsineke and Dulcy Fankam Mendjiadeu, the best players in The American all season, were recognized for just that as both were named Co-Players of the Year and were unanimous picks for First Team All-Conference. It marks the first time that the Bulls have had a player(s) named Player of the Year in The American and it's just the second time in conference history – the first since 2017 – that two individuals have shared the honor. Sammie Puisis was named the conference Newcomer of the Year – another first for South Florida – and was a Second Team selection while Carla Brito was named to the All-Freshman Team.\n2021–22 (NCAA Tournament)\nWith nearly every significant player returning from the AAC regular-season and tournament championship teams, expectations were soaring for the Bulls. USF boosted its stock by defeating No. 9 Oregon 71-62 in the Bad Boy Mowers Battle 4 Atlantis. Then in a standalone game, also in the Bahamas, the Bulls upended No. 7 Stanford, the defending national champion, 57-54 on Sydni Harvey’s 3-pointer from the wing with 2.8 seconds remaining. The Bulls won five straight games to close out the AAC regular season, including a smashing 71-38 romp against Houston on a night in which the 50th anniversary of USF women’s basketball was celebrated. The Bulls reached the AAC Tournament championship game but fell to top-seeded UCF 53-45. In the NCAA Tournament’s opening round, the Bulls were beaten by Miami 78-66.\n2020–21 (NCAA Tournament)\nDespite seeking a sense of normalcy, the Bulls dealt with COVID-19 obstacles all season. But USF still advanced to its seventh NCAA Tournament and its fourth appearance in the Round of 32. USF played a modified regular-season schedule of 24 games – four non-conference and 20 in the AAC – with next to no fans at home games due to restrictions. Eight games were either postponed or canceled, including seven straight, but USF still was 19-4 and 12-2 in the AAC. The Bulls nearly shocked the fourth-ranked Baylor Lady Bears, the defending national champion, but fell 67-62. In the next game, USF defeated the No. 6-ranked Mississippi State Bulldogs in overtime, the highest-ranked team it had ever beaten. It was the first of program-record 13-straight victories for USF, which rose to its highest ranking in program history, No. 12 in the Feb. 15 Associated Press Top 25 poll.\nAfter winning the AAC regular-season title, USF had an impressive showing when the league announced its postseason award winners. Five players were honored, and Fernandez was named the AAC Coach of the Year. Elisa Pinzan was tabbed the league’s Most Improved Player, and Maria Alvarez was chosen as the Co-Sixth Player of the Year. Bethy Mununga and Elena Tsineke were named to the All-AAC first team, Pinzan was a second-team selection and Sydni Harvey earned third-team honors. Following USF’s historic showing in the conference tournament, Harvey was named tournament Most Outstanding Player after averaging a team-high 16.0 points per game. Tsineke, the championship game’s leading scorer (23 points), and Mununga joined Harvey on the All-Tournament Team. In addition, Fernandez was a finalist for the 2021 United States Marine Corps/WBCA NCAA Division I National Coach of the Year and was a semifinalist for the 2021 Werner Ladder Naismith Women’s Coach of the Year.    \n2019–20 * \nIn a basketball season that will include an asterisk moving forward, USF was on the cusp of recording its seventh 20-win season in the last eight years and advancing to its seventh straight postseason tournament. However the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of the remainder of the NCAA basketball season. The Bulls endured a second consecutive year of season-ending and significant injuries, but still recorded a 19-13 record and advanced to the AAC Tournament semifinals for the seventh straight year. After getting as high as No. 21 in the AP and No. 20 in the Coaches poll, USF posted signature non-conference wins against No. 15 Texas, 64-57, and VCU, 77-55, and trailed No. 2 Baylor by three with three minutes left before falling in the end. In addition, the Bulls No. 5 UConn at the half and trailed by just five points entering the fourth quarter before UConn pulled away in its final AAC appearance at the Yuengling Center.\nTsineke, the team’s leading scorer, was tabbed AAC Freshman of the Year, in addition to being named to the All-Freshmen Team and third team All-Conference. Pinzan, the league leader in assists per game, was named third team All-Conference.\n2018–19 (WNIT)\nDecimated by season-ending injuries, USF battled into the AAC Tournament semifinals for the sixth straight season. The Bulls, ranked No. 22 nationally, extended their postseason appearance streak to eight as they advanced to the WNIT second round. USF posted marquee non-conference wins against Ohio State (71-47 on the road), Oklahoma (87-70), UCLA (60-56), and George Washington (63-60), en route to a 9-2 start. The Bulls also nearly stunned No. 2 UConn at the Yuengling Center on Senior Night, trailing the Huskies by one with just over six minutes to play, before UConn ended the game on a 9-0 run. Enna Pehadzic was tabbed a second-team All-Conference selection while Harvey was named to the All-Freshman Team. \n2017–18 (NCAA Tournament)\nUSF reached its fourth straight AAC Tournament championship game and made its fourth straight NCAA Tournament appearance. Fernandez was named AAC Coach of the Year. The Bulls were led by seniors Laia Flores and Jespersen, who earned AP honorable-mention All-America honors, and junior guard Kitija Laksa. USF finished 26-8, which included an 84-65 home trouncing of No. 13 Ohio State.\n2016–17 (NCAA Tournament)\nThe Bulls entered the season being ranked for 22 consecutive weeks. They had the most successful non-conference record. For the second straight year, Fernandez coached the league’s Freshman of the Year (Tamara Henshaw) and a unanimous conference first-team selection (Laksa). On January 17, 2017, Fernandez, the all-time winningest coach in USF basketball history, reached his 300th career win in front of a home crowd at the Yuengling Center. The Bulls reached the AAC Tournament title game for the third straight season.\n2015–16 (NCAA Tournament)\nThe Bulls returned to the NCAA Tournament for the third time in four years and ended the season in the top-25 for the second straight season. Along with coaching the program’s first All-American, Fernandez achieved the highest ranking in program history (No. 15 in both the AP and USA Today Coaches’ polls). USF made its 12th postseason run in 13 seasons and its fourth NCAA Tournament appearance in program history.\nThe graduating class was the first to make three NCAA appearances. It reached the postseason four times and made back-to-back trips to the AAC Tournament title game. Fernandez coached the program’s first WBCA All-American (Williams), and the third-highest drafted Bull in USF Athletics history. Fernandez also guided Laksa to the program’s second conference Freshman of the Year honor.\n2014–15 (NCAA Tournament)\nFernandez posted the program’s sixth 20-win season (and third consecutive). The Bulls made history with two Top 25 rankings in the AP Poll en route to the program’s best record (27-8). The Bulls reached a conference tournament championship game for the first time, grabbed the best NCAA Tournament seed in school history (No. 6), and hosted the early rounds for the first time. Fernandez coached an All-Region player for the third time in three years, and Williams was among the 12 Wade Trophy Finalists.\n2013–14 (WNIT)\nUSF made a deep run in the WNIT Tournament and Fernandez came one game shy of playing for his second WNIT Championship as the Bulls fell to Rutgers at home. The 23-13 season set the stage for the 2014-15 run.\n2012–13 (NCAA Tournament)\nThe Bulls made just the program’s second NCAA Tournament appearance, earning a berth with 21 regular-season wins, including back-to-back wins against No. 12 Louisville on the road and No. 21 Syracuse at home. The Bulls defeated the Texas Tech Red Raiders 71-70 for their first NCAA Tournament victory, then lost to eventual Final Four team California in overtime, after a thrilling second-half comeback. Fernandez was the only coach to play all Final Four teams in 2012-13, defeating Louisville, losing to Notre Dame and California in overtime, and facing UConn in the regular season. Fernandez picked up win No. 200 of his career when USF defeated Detroit 74-60. Andrea Smith was drafted by the Connecticut Sun, adding to the trail of USF’s post-college success.\n2011–12 (WNIT)\nFernandez guided USF to 19 wins despite having no true home games as the Sun Dome underwent renovations. The Bulls advanced to the WNIT’s third round before falling at James Madison.\n2010–11\nUSF finished 12-19 (3-13 slate in conference play) following its big 60-55 home win against No. 17/19 Georgetown in Tampa. After the season concluded, USF broke ground on its state-of-the-art practice facility, the Pam and Les Muma Basketball Center.\n2009–10 (WNIT)\nThe Bulls advanced to their seventh consecutive postseason and posted a 15-16 record.\n2008–09 (WNIT Champions)\nFernandez guided the Bulls to their most successful campaign. USF registered a school-record 27 wins and finished at least .500 (8-8) for the third time in the program’s four years in the BIG EAST Conference. The Bulls had a second-place finish in the Paradise Jam in St. Thomas, U.S.V.I. with wins against Iowa, in overtime, and Texas Tech. The only loss during the event would come at the hands of No. 3 ranked California. USF defeated Rutgers on the road for the first time, and handed DePaul a crucial setback.\nAfter advancing to their sixth consecutive postseason tournament, the Bulls made history by going 5-0 in the WNIT. After defeating Florida Gulf Coast in overtime and Southeastern Conference foe Ole Miss at home, USF embarked on a three-game, 10-day road odyssey that began in western New York with an 80-66 win at St. Bonaventure, then an 82-65 victory at Boston College. The Bulls headed to the nation’s heartland where they handed Kansas a 75-71 loss in the WNIT finals in front of a record crowd of 16,113 at historic Allen Fieldhouse.\n2007–08 (WNIT)\nThe Bulls (16-16) advanced to their fifth consecutive postseason event, facing Florida Gulf Coast in the WNIT. USF knocked off No. 25 DePaul, 78-73, and defeated Syracuse in the BIG EAST Tournament’s first round, 68-67 in overtime. The Orange had just dropped out of the Top 25 prior to their loss to the Bulls.\n2006–07 (WNIT)\nOn Dec. 28, 2006, with a 77-62 win against Vermont in the first round of the Saint Joseph’s University Hawk Classic, Fernandez became the USF women’s basketball team’s career leader in wins, surpassing former Bulls’ head coach and former Charlotte Sting leader Trudi Lacey.\nLater, Fernandez recorded his 100th career win a 66-49 win against Coppin State on March 19, 2007 in the second round of the WNIT. In addition, that appearance in the WNIT was the program’s fourth straight postseason trip for USF, a first for either basketball program at the school.\n2005–06 (NCAA Tournament)\nUSF earned its first NCAA Tournament bid. Although the Bulls fell just short of the win total of the previous year, they made history by earning a No. 9 seed in the Bridgeport Region and were defeated 67-65 by No. 8 seed USC at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va.\nThe Bulls defeated nationally ranked DePaul (79-77 OT) and Notre Dame (68-64 OT). USF boasted a 19-12 record and a 9-7 conference slate (sixth in the BIG EAST).\nThe team’s 2005-06 slate was the toughest in school history. The Bulls faced eventual Final Four participants No. 7/8 North Carolina, No. 13/15 Michigan State, and No. 3/3 LSU all prior to their conference schedule.\n2004–05 (WNIT)\nThe Bulls recorded their best record (21-11) and set a school mark for wins in conference play (9-5). The team advanced to its second-consecutive WNIT, which included a home victory against Florida.\n2003–04 (WNIT)\nThe Bulls’ 33rd ranked class included freshmen Jessica Dickson, Nalini Miller and Rachael Sheats, along with junior college transfer Anedra Gilmore. Along with this core group of newcomers and veteran returnees, Fernandez helped the Bulls advance to the postseason for the first time in school history when they faced Richmond in the first round of the WNIT \n2002–03\nFernandez followed his original recruiting class with a group that was tabbed 40th in America as it entered the 2002–03 campaign.\n2001–02\nFernandez’s first Division I recruiting class was ranked No. 36 in America by the All-Star Girls Report, the highest-ranked class in the history of the women’s basketball program. That class provided instant dividends for USF as the Bulls opened 7-0 en route to their first winning season in four years (14–13) after going 4–24 the previous year. In that seven-game stretch, the Bulls defeated in-state rival and then BIG EAST Conference member Miami before falling to Florida for their first loss of the year.\n2000–01\nFernandez was named head coach of the Bulls on Nov. 14, 2000, and began laying the foundation for what would be the success of the current USF women’s basketball program. \nPrior to USF\nFernandez started in coaching while working on his associate degree at Miami-Dade CC Kendall, where he earned his degree in 1991. Fernandez served as a student assistant coach for the men’s basketball team and was immediately thrown into the fray with on-floor coaching, scouting, and most importantly, overseeing recruiting correspondence and getting his name out in front of coaches around the state.\nIt was at Miami-Dade that Fernandez met Cesar Odio, who not only saw his potential and hired him as a student assistant, then promoted him to a full-time assistant coach in 1991. He stayed at Miami-Dade for one season (1991-92) before becoming the assistant boys’ basketball coach at Miami’s Sunset High School (1992-94).\nFollowing his two seasons at Sunset, Fernandez and Odio renewed acquaintances when Odio was tabbed head men’s basketball coach at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla. (1994-96). Fernandez came along as Odio’s top assistant and immediately established himself as a coach who had a sharp eye for talent and potential. During his two-year stay at Barry, Fernandez helped the Buccaneers to consecutive winning seasons, after the program only produced two in the first 10 years, and a combined 34-21 record.\nFernandez began coaching girls’ basketball in 1996, when he secured his first head coaching job at Miami’s Lourdes Academy. During his three seasons at Lourdes, Fernandez led the Bobcats to a 83-16 (.838) record and a trip to the state Class 5A championship game in 1998 where they finished as the runner-up. In addition to his coaching responsibilities at Lourdes, Fernandez established roots among high school coaches from around Florida and the nation as director and founder of the successful Miami Suns AAU program.\nFernandez broke into collegiate women’s basketball when he returned to Barry for his second of two tours of duty at the school. In his second stint, he served one year (1999-00) as the top assistant coach for the Buccaneers. Although it was just one season, Fernandez helped Barry record the second-most wins in the program’s history as the Buccaneers posted a 22-8 record and the program’s second-best slate ever in the Sunshine State Conference at 10-4. The team’s 22 wins that season is still just one of three 20-wins campaigns for Barry since the women’s basketball team started competing during the 1988-89 season.\nAfter graduating from Miami-Dade Kendall, Fernandez earned his bachelor’s degree in physical education in 1994 from Florida International University. Along with his coaching duties at the beginning of his professional career, Fernandez also taught physical education at Miami’s Coral Reef Senior High School, Southwest Senior High School and Hialeah Middle School.\nFernandez and his wife, Tonya, live in Tampa with their daughters, Sydnie, Alex, Taylor, Brianna, Brooke, and their seven foster dogs."

        "text": "The 2016 Euroleague Final Four was the concluding EuroLeague Final Four tournament of the 2015–16 Euroleague season, which was the 59th season of Europe's premier club basketball tournament, and the 16th season since it has been organised by Euroleague Basketball. The Final Four was played at the Mercedes-Benz Arena, in Berlin, Germany, in May 2016. CSKA Moscow won its 7th EuroLeague title, after beating Fenerbahçe in the championship game, by a score of 101–96, in overtime.\nVenue.\nOn May 11, 2015, Euroleague Basketball announced that the 2016 Final Four would be played at the Mercedes-Benz Arena, in Berlin, Germany. With a seating capacity of 14,500 people for basketball games, it is home to the Alba Berlin basketball team, and is used for ice hockey, basketball, and handball games, as well as concerts. The area surrounding the arena is filled with various entertainment venues, including a cinema, a casino, a hotel, and various bars and restaurants. The arena previously hosted the 2009 Euroleague Final Four. The arena was one of the most prominent elements of the Mediaspree urban redevelopment project, and it quickly gained emblematic status in the debates surrounding the project's impact.\nThe LED construction grid on the facade of the arena was equipped with more than 300,000 LED clusters on a high, and approximately wide section of the semicircular 105° glass facade, with a total area of more than . Light pixels, consisting of two groups of 19 LEDs (colour palette: 16.7 million RGB colours), were attached to the vertical bracing of the facade. The vertical distances were , and the horizontal distances between the axes were .\nChampionship game.\nThe Final was the second Final Four meeting between the two teams. In the 2015 Euroleague Final Four, CSKA Moscow beat Fenerbahçe 86–80, in the third-place game. It was the first European final for Fenerbahçe, while CSKA played in its 13th championship game.\nIn the Final, it seemed early on that CSKA was destined to win its seventh EuroLeague title. After a strong first half, the Russian side led 30–50 at halftime, and had a lead of as many as 21 points in the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, Fenerbahçe surged back, and CSKA player, Victor Khryapa, had to score a tip-in with 1.9 seconds remaining on the game clock, to tie the game. It was the third Final in EuroLeague history that went to overtime. In overtime, CSKA, led by Nando De Colo, took the lead, and finally claimed its seventh EuroLeague title, and its first one in eight years."

The 28 teams were drawn into four groups, two containing eight teams (Groups A and B) and two containing six teams (Groups C and D), with the restriction that teams from the same national association cannot face each other in the same group.\nThe group stage line-up was confirmed on 20 June 2015, allocating 16 teams to Groups A and B and the remaining 12 teams (11 + winner of qualification stage) to Groups C and D.

After completion of the group stage matches, the teams advancing to the knockout stage were determined in the following manner:\nTiebreakers.\nIn the group stage, teams were ranked according to points (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). After completion of the group stage, if two or more teams have scored the same number of points, the ranking was determined as follows (article 4.3.1, section II of regulations):\nIf the ranking of one of these teams is determined, the above criteria are consecutively followed until the ranking of all teams is determined. If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by EHF through drawing of lots.\nDuring the group stage, only criteria 4–5 apply to determine the provisional ranking of teams.\nGroups.\nThe matchdays were 16–20 September, 23–27 September, 30 September–4 October, 7–11 October, 14–18 October, 21–25 October, 11–15 November, 18–22 November, 25–29 November and 2–6 December 2015.

The game is officially licensed by the International Olympic Committee, as are the other games in the series. It was developed by Sega, with assistance from Arzest and Spike Chunsoft, and published by Nintendo. It is the fifth title in the \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" series. The game is a collection of Olympic sports themed mini-games featuring characters from the \"Mario\" series and the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series.\nThe game received generally mixed reviews upon release. A sixth game in the series, \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\", was released in November 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.\nGameplay.\nThe game features forty-two playable characters from \"Mario\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" franchises, as well as the option to use a previously made Mii character in-game. In the Nintendo 3DS version of the game, Mario, Sonic, and Mii are the only characters that can be used in all events; other returning characters are exclusive to two events while new characters are only playable in one. In the Wii U version of the game, all returning characters from previous games are usable in all events, while new playable characters (known as \"guests\" in-game) are only playable in one.\nThe characters new to the series that can be used in both versions of the game include Diddy Kong, Nabbit, Wendy O. Koopa, Larry Koopa, Rosalina, Dry Bowser, Jet the Hawk, Rouge the Bat, Wave the Swallow, Espio the Chameleon, Zavok, Sticks the Badger, and Zazz. In the Wii U version, Toad is featured as an exclusive character. In the 3DS version, Roy Koopa, Ludwig von Koopa, Dry Bones, Birdo, Dr. Eggman Nega, E-123 Omega, and Cream the Rabbit all appear as exclusive characters. Each character has their own individual statistics for 'power', 'speed' and 'technique', which affect the player's performance depending on the variables of the minigame.\nRugby Sevens, Archery, and BMX debut in the game alongside refined versions of returning events, such as athletics, volleyball, archery, swimming and equestrian. \nUnlike prior installments, motion controls have been removed from a majority of events across both versions. The Wii U version's multiplayer mode requires at least all but one player to each use a Wii Remote, usually turned on its side, while allowing one other player to use a Wii U GamePad.\nEach event is held in a re-creation of its corresponding venue in the actual 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was first revealed on the Japanese Nintendo Direct website on May 30, 2015. Like the previous games, the game was officially licensed by the International Olympic Committee. Both versions of the game released worldwide in 2016. An arcade edition of the game was also announced by Sega, which was released in Japan in 2016. It was released in North America and Europe on June 24, 2016, alongside the Wii U version.\nReception.\nOn the review aggregator Metacritic, both the 3DS and Wii U versions of the game received \"mixed or average\" scores of 60 (based on 30 critics) and 65 (based on 26 critics) respectively. The game was criticised for being too similar to past installments of the \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" series. \"Nintendo World Report\" gave the Wii U version a 7/10, stating \"While the limited amount of events are the major downer here, I had fun playing them alone or with friends\".\nStuart Andrews of \"TrustedReviews\" gave the Wii U version a 7/10, stating, \"It’s every bit as shallow and silly as previous titles, taking on a broad range of disciplines without ever really mastering any. Yet, if you’re looking for a fun game to play with the family then it’s one of the most enjoyable I’ve played this year.\""

They have qualified for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio when they secured second place at the 2015 IWRF European Championship. \nThe 2000 Paralympics in Sydney were the inaugural Games for wheelchair rugby after the sport was included as a demonstration event four years earlier. Sweden were one of eight teams competing for medals and were placed in group A, along with Switzerland and eventual gold and silver medalists the United States and Australia. Sweden lost to both the States and Australia, but a good 44 - 35 win over the Swiss, saw them finish the preliminaries in third place. Although out of medal contention, Sweden beat both Germany and Great Britain to finish in fifth place, the highest placed European team and Sweden's best Paralympic placing to date.\nSweden failed to qualify for both the 2004 and 2008 Games, but after winning the 2011 European Championship in Nottwil they qualified for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. The team were placed in group B, with Belgium and in a repeat of their 2000 tournament they were grouped with the eventual gold and silver medalists, this time Australia and Canada. They began the campaign with a convincing 52-42 win over Belgium but this was followed by defeat to Australia and a one point loss to the Canadians. By finishing third Sweden were again unable to play for the medals. In the positional playoffs they started strongly by beating France 58–48, but in their final match they were convincingly beaten by the host nation, Great Britain, to finish in sixth place. "

        "text": "The 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship season was the fifth edition of the FIA World Endurance Championship auto racing series co-organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series was open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-style racing cars meeting four ACO categories. The season began at the Silverstone Circuit in April and ended at the Bahrain International Circuit in November, and included the 84th running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This season was also the last WEC season for Audi Sport Team Joest as they decided not to race in the 2017 FIA World Endurance Championship Season.\nSchedule.\nThe ACO announced a provisional calendar during the 2015 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas in September 2015. The calendar retains the eight rounds from 2015, but adds the 6 Hours of Mexico City at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. The World Sportscar Championship previously visited Mexico City in 1991. The Nürburgring round has been moved a month forward to July to close the gap after Le Mans.\nA test session was held prior to the start of the season at Circuit Paul Ricard in March, while the mandatory test for the 24 Hours of Le Mans was held in the first week of June.\nEntries.\nThe FIA unveiled an entry of 32 cars for the 2016 season on 5 February, divided into four categories: Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) and 2 (LMP2), and Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) and Amateur (LMGTE Am).\nTechnical changes.\nThe FIA have introduced a number of changes to the LMP1 cars for 2016 to reduce their speed. This is due to the 2015 cars being significantly faster than 2014 with most track records broken in 2015. The pace of development of the hybrid powertrains has resulted in cars racing with more than 1000 hp.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below. Invitational entries may have finished ahead of WEC competitors in individual races.\nEntries were required to complete the timed race as well as to complete 70% of the overall winning car's race distance in order to earn championship points. A single bonus point was awarded to the team and all drivers of the pole position car for each category in qualifying. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the race result points allocation was doubled. Furthermore, a race must complete three laps under green flag conditions in order for championship points to be awarded.\nDriver championships.\nFive titles were offered to drivers in the 2016 season. The World Championship was reserved for LMP1 and LMP2 drivers, while the World Cup for GT Drivers was available for drivers in the LMGTE categories. Further, three FIA Endurance Trophies were also awarded to drivers in the LMP2 and LMGTE Am categories, and privateers in the LMP1 category.\nManufacturer championships.\nTwo manufacturers' titles were contested, one for LMPs and one for LMGTEs. The World Endurance Championship for Manufacturers is only open to manufacturer entries in the LMP1 category, while the World Endurance Cup for GT Manufacturers allows all entries from registered manufacturers in LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am to participate. The top two finishing cars from each manufacturer earn points toward their total.\nTeam championships.\nAll categories award a team trophy for each individual entry, although LMP1 is limited to entries not from a manufacturer."

The organization was originally known as the Breezy Point North Stars and was founded as a non-profit corporation operated by Whitebirch, Inc.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 2012, the North Stars were originally managed by Joe Bergquist. The first head coach was Brian Henrichs. The first victory in franchise history came in their ninth league game, a 3–2 win over the Alexandria Blizzard on October 19, 2012.\nAfter two seasons and just 12 victories, Henrichs was replaced by Jeff Worlton, a former minor league player and head coach in the North American Hockey League. In 2016, Worlton would be hired mid-season by the North American Hockey League's Kenai River Brown Bears and assistant coach Josh Dallman would take over as head coach. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Dallman would also leave to work for Worlton again in Kenai and the North Stars would hire Jon Jonasson, former head coach of the Helena Bighorns, as head coach for 2016–17. Jonasson left after one season and was replaced by DJ Vold. Former professional player Mike Muller was hired as the head coach for the 2019–20 season.\nAfter the 2019–20 season, the team stated it would not be participating in the following season. After one dormant season, the franchise was sold in 2021 to MHCPA, LLC, an ownership group composed of Craig Larson, Anthony Maucieri, and former NHL player Chris Stewart. The franchise was reactivated as the Minnesota Loons for the 2021–22 season and the new management re-hired Muller as head coach.\nAfter the 2023-24 season, the Minnesota Loons moved from Breezy Point to Eveleth, Minnesota, where they went under the umbrella of the Minnesota Wilderness. They will use the same name, colors, logos, and uniforms.\nAlumni.\nThe North Stars have had a number of alumni move on to collegiate programs and higher levels of junior ice hockey in the United States and Canada."

Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce entered the competition as the defending champion and the world leading athlete that season with a time of 10.74 seconds.\nSummary.\nThe semi-finals eliminated the second fastest woman in 2015, English Gardner, otherwise it was mostly the expected fastest athletes from the world list. The surprise was Dafne Schippers improving her own national record by almost a tenth of a second to 10.83 while winning the third semi-final. Previous to that, Schippers had one significant win in London at the end of July, a race that only included one other finalist, Blessing Okagbare, and had been soundly defeated by Fraser-Pryce, Gardner and Okagbare in Paris in early June. Schippers time won her a center lane position, towering next to Fraser-Pryce in the final.\nIn the final, the gun went off and as expected Fraser-Pryce, the \"pocket rocket\" was out in front, her first three steps clearly faster than the field. While Schippers had the second best reaction time of the field, she appeared to be slightly behind Natasha Morrison and Michelle-Lee Ahye with veteran Veronica Campbell-Brown out in second place behind her teammate. But as top end speed was reached, Schippers and Tori Bowie behind her began eating into the lead with every stride. \nShe was unable to catch Fraser-Pryce who held her arms up in victory as she crossed the line, running out of time Schippers made a desperate early lean at the finish while Bowie over strided her last few steps also in desperation in third. \nEach of the first 5 were clearly separated by .05 of a second. Schippers 10.81 in second place improved upon her national record for the second time in the same day.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: Best 3 (Q) and next 3 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nWind:\nHeat 1: +0.5 m/s, Heat 2: -1.3 m/s, Heat 3: -1.2 m/s Heat 4: +2.3 m/s, Heat 5: -1.6 m/s, Heat 6: +1.5 m/s, Heat 7: -0.5 m/s\nSemifinals.\nQualification: Best 2 (Q) and next 2 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nWind:\nHeat 1: +0.5 m/s, Heat 2: +0.9 m/s, Heat 3: -0.2 m/s\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 21:35.\nWind: -0.3 m/s"

Reigning Olympic champion, Allyson Felix won a bye to compete by virtue of winning the 2014 IAAF Diamond League, but passed in order to focus on the 400 metres which would hold its final less than an hour before the semi-final round. 2013 silver medalist Murielle Ahouré did not return, and 2013 bronze medalist Blessing Okagbare did not start in the heats.\nIn the finals, two time Olympic Champion and 2011 World Champion Veronica Campbell-Brown relegated to lane 2 after finishing 7th in the semis, was the leader out of the blocks with Dina Asher-Smith and Jeneba Tarmoh also getting good starts. Elaine Thompson was last out of the blocks but rocketed around the turn to be the second to hit the straightaway behind \"VCB.\" Candyce McGrone was about even with Asher-Smith and Dafne Schippers behind them with less than 90 metres to the finish. Thompson continued her speed to the front as Schippers let out her long strides to eat up territory. McGrone and Campbell-Brown were in the battle for bronze, Schippers looking too far back to catch Thompson but gaining with every stride. And Schippers caught her with 5 metres to spare, continuing on to the win. Campbell-Brown held off McGrone for bronze. \nSchippers time of 21.63 made her the #3 performer of all time, Thompson at 21.66 became #5. Neither of them had been on the list prior to this race. It was a .40 improvement of her personal best for Schippers and a .44 improvement for Thompson. Schippers took down Marita Koch's 36-year-old, drug tainted European record and broke the 28 year old Championship Record held by East Germany's Silke Gladisch Moeller. Both runners were faster than Allyson Felix or Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce have ever run. Dina Asher-Smith's 22.07 in fifth place became the new British record and the fastest performance by a teenager, though cannot surpass Felix's junior world record because Asher Smith would turn 20 before the end of the calendar year. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: Best 3 (Q) and next 3 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 21:00."

In the final, both were out ahead, along with Wayde van Niekerk and Isaac Makwala, Africans with none of those credentials. Through the final turn, van Niekerk took sole possession of the lead, Makwala passed James to hit the home stretch with a slight advantage in second. Far off the pace was Luguelín Santos. Down the home stretch, Makwala was unable to hold his position and was passed by a burst from James. James was unable to hold that burst, Merritt cruised past James but was unable to make any headway on van Niekerk's lead. \nMerritt made a desperate lean that actually cost him time but was well beaten, Santos followed Merritt down the home stretch to take fourth beating the National Record he set in the semi-final round. \nvan Niekerk's 43.48 improved upon his own African Record, putting him at number 4 on the all-time list.

Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain entered the competition as the defending champion.\nSummary.\nAllyson Felix is known as a 200 metres specialist, but two years earlier her string of 200 meter championships was snapped along with her hamstring in the final. Based on winning the 2014 Diamond League, Felix was qualified to enter the 200 metres here but chose to forgo that opportunity to put all her eggs in this basket. This was her bid to win the one title she didn't have under her belt, the same event she narrowly lost to Amantle Montsho of Botswana four years prior at 2011 IAAF World Championships. With world leader Francena McCorory unable to qualify to run here at the American Championships, Felix was the name to beat. The defending champion Christine Ohuruogu, known for her late rush, also made the final.\nWith high expectations, Felix took off strongly running her first 200 metres in the dominant fashion one would expect of a 200 metres specialist. She kept building on her lead coming off the final turn several steps ahead of Shericka Jackson the next out of the turn. The question was if she would have the strength to finish, or would her legs turn to jello as happened to Sanya Richards-Ross with the same kind of aggressive start on this same track seven years earlier. \nThe answer was no. While Felix didn't advance her lead, she kept her margin on Jackson for a clear win. \nShaunae Miller made a powerful rush to the finish, passing Jackson for the silver and gaining on Felix down the home stretch. Jackson beat three other Jamaican teammates for the bronze.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 20:40."

        "text": "The men's 800 metres at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 22, 23 and 25 August.\nSummary.\nThere is a definite change in this event. Returning silver medalist Nick Symmonds and returning bronze medalist Ayanleh Souleiman did not enter. Returning champion Mohammed Aman was disqualified for interference in the semi-final round. In fact, of the eight finalists in 2013, only Pierre-Ambroise Bosse returned to the final. Olympic silver medalist, the promising young Nijel Amos got pipped at the line in his slowest heat of the semi-finals and had to watch the final. World record holder David Rudisha did make the final winning that semi, but has not been running the times he ran during his world record years. The only other finalist with Olympic or World Championship 800 finals experience was 2011 sixth placer Adam Kszczot.\nIn the final, as world record holder, Rudisha commanded all eyeballs. The field expected Rudisha to lead and lead he did, but not to a 50-second first lap, but a very slow 54.15. For point of comparison, 54.15 was exactly the same time Mo Farah ran in the last lap of the 10,000 metres in these championships. With his compatriot Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich on his shoulder, the two acted as a wall at the front, but nobody else looked like they wanted to pass. 200 more metres went by at the slow pace, finally Kszczot tried to sneak by on the inside, but Rudisha wouldn't let him, accelerating to maintain the lead and continuing to speed up. With world leader and notable kicker Amel Tuka perfectly aligned to pounce, Rudisha just continued to speed up. Only Kszczot was able to follow but the entire field was losing ground. \nTuka's speed was not in evidence to the same degree as his previous races this season, instead straining to go around Cheruiyot to get the bronze medal. Tuka's medal was the first for Bosnia and Herzegovina. But it was the old guard 1-2 vs the newcomers. \nHow did Rudisha's strategy work against these elite athletes? His last 200 metres was timed at 24.34, a speed most of these athletes are unfamiliar with at the end of a race. Even when a kicker like Tuka, or others with a similar strategy; Symmonds. Borzakovskiy, Robinson or Wottle runs by, they are passing slowing, depleted athletes with a 26+ or high 25 final 200. And most of these competitors are the ones slowing to make that final 200 from a kicker look so impressive. Additionally, with the Kenyan's expert team tactics, Cherulyot's position caused everyone except Kszczot to have to run around Cherulyot at speeds they are not used to. Save Tuka's exceptional finishing speed, the strategy would have gotten Cherulyot a bronze medal.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: Best 3 (Q) and next 6 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 20:55."

        "text": "The men's 1500 metres at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 27, 28 and 30 August.\nSummary.\nThe process of running rounds in the 1500 tends to select strategic experts because nobody would want to run hard three times in four days as this schedule would require. Since 2008 (excepting that bad race at the 2012 Olympics), the expert in this has been two-time defending champion Asbel Kiprop. But in case anybody wanted to run fast, Kiprop also left a message at the fastest race of the year in Monaco, where he blew away many of the members of this field by almost 2 seconds in his near miss of the world record. What makes Kiprop so dangerous is his ability to accelerate from the back of the field and in the final that is exactly where he went. Was he hiding or just waiting to pounce? With three other Kenyan teammates making it to the final, there was talk about a potential sweep. Timothy Cheruiyot and Elijah Motonei Manangoi took the race through an honest first two laps in 1:58.62. Only Aman Wote ran aggressively with them at the front, the other tacticians lining themselves up for the finish. Matthew Centrowitz, Jr. was the first to move forward as they came through for the bell. With 300 metres to go, Olympic champion Taoufik Makhloufi made his move, identical to the Olympics, Kiprop near the back of the pack beating only two Americans and boxed by Wote. Over the next 100 metres, Makhloufi opened a lead chase by Abdalaati Iguider. Kiprop slowed down to get out of the box, then ran around Wote out to lane 3. The tall Kenyan was now clearly moving faster than the rest of the field he was passing on the outside. As Kiprop swept past the field after the North African duo, only Silas Kiplagat came with him, these four breaking from the rest. As Kiprop caught Iguider, he reacted and ran even with Kiprop up to Makhloufi. With 50 metres to go, it was three abreast across the track with Kiplagat chasing Kiprop on the outside less than two metres back. Kiprop broke past the two North Africans and ran on to victory, while Iguider edged ahead of a spent Makhloufi. Out of nowhere (actually a distant fifth place) came sprinting Manangoi, faster than any of the leaders, drifting out to lane 3 for clear sailing. Passing three people in the last 10 metres, Manangoi crossed the finish line just ahead of a desperately diving Iguider to take silver, Iguider doing a full face plant to the track across the finish line holding on to bronze. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 6 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on 30 August at 19:45."

In contrast, the world-leading athlete that season Genzebe Dibaba had broken the long-standing world record for the event the previous month.\nThe semi-finals were definitely a contrast with the second semi run eight seconds faster than the first, still no favorites were left behind. From the gun in the final, the field seemed to drop back in unison, leaving Americans Shannon Rowbury and Jennifer Simpson out front. \nWith no guidance, the two jogged through a 1:17.06 first lap. As the slow pace continued, the overwhelming favorite Dibaba jogged up to the outside of Simpson's shoulder. With just over 2 laps to go, Dibaba took the lead and turned it into an 800-meter race, her first 100 metres of acceleration bringing the second lap time down to 68.58. Simpson tried to chase but Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon, Aregawi and Dawit Seyaum overtook her chasing Dibaba. Dibaba's penultimate lap was 57.9 with Sifan Hassan moving forward, with Chepngetich, then Seyaum continuing to chase and Aregawi falling back. Hassan passed Chepngetich through the final turn and the battle became for the silver medal. With Dibaba pulling away, Hassan couldn't hold her speed. Drifting to the outside of the lane, she gave space for Chepngetich to move through back into second place. Dibaba slowed as she celebrated crossing the finish line arms raised above her head, still her final 800 metres was 1:57.3, only Eunice Sum had run an 800 metres race that fast in 2015. Even Hassan, who was at the back of the pack when the kick started ran faster than any other woman had run an 800 in 2015 by running a 1:57.6.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: Best 6 (Q) and next 6 fastest (q) qualify for the next round.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 20:35."

        "text": "The men's 5000 metres at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 26 and 29 August.\nSummary.\nIt was difficult to predict the results. Down at number 21 was the double Olympic Champion, defending champion attempting to repeat his double from two years earlier, Mo Farah, undoubtedly the favorite. At number 3 was returning silver medalist Hagos Gebrhiwet coming from the fastest race of the year in Rome, won by his Ethiopian teammate, World Junior Champion Yomif Kejelcha. Returning bronze medalist Isiah Koech was down at number 13. 2014 Diamond League Champion and Commonwealth Games Champion Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku was nowhere to be seen in the top 50 in the world, not having to qualify in the Kenyan trials.\nIn the finals, it was a slow pace at the beginning. Absurdly, the organizers placed a water station in lane 9, instead of lane 3 where it was located during the 10,000. At 1200 metres, with the pace dawdling, Farah alone chose to take advantage of the water stop, having to run all the way across the track in both directions, but still maintaining contact with the back of the field. At the front of the pack, by default, was a British uniform, but not Farah, it was Tom Farrell with eyes wandering to the TV monitors. You could sense the entire field was wanting to use a rear view mirror. What is Farah doing back there?\nAfter five and a half laps, Farah casually jogged to the outside past the entire field to behind Farrell. Suddenly the scramble was on, people rushing for position. Imane Merga rushed to the front and took a 2-meter lead. Farah marked that and let Merga lead until four and a half laps to go still at an agonizingly slow pace, then Farah decided to take the lead and move just slightly faster. All of the other favorites jockeyed around but none of them seemed to make an attempt to pass him.\nHaving watched Farah launch his kick from 500 meters out in the 10,000 metres earlier in this meet, Ndiku tried to go one better and started to run for home with more than 800 to go, Farah running to stay in contact, Gebrhiwet, Galen Rupp, Ben True and Kejelcha in tow. For the next lap the field stretched out. Farah made a brief burst tor try to take the lead just before one lap to go, but Ndiku wouldn't let him by. One by one all the other suitors fell off the back, the last Gebrhiwet, finally fading on the backstretch, but Farah crept closer. Around the final turn, Kejelcha passed Gebrhiwet, while Farah moved into position to launch a final kick. \nWith a perfectly executed final sprint, Farah passed Ndiku with 70 metres to go, Ndiku had nothing in the tank to respond with. \nBehind them Gebrhiwet executed a similar pass against his teammate Kejelcha to take the bronze.\nNdiku ran the next to the last lap in 56.3 (Farah slightly slower), Farah completed the last 800 metres in 1:49.0 Despite the assortment of national affiliations listed, the entire pack, the top 13 finishers came from just four countries, three of them neighboring countries of East Africa; Somalia 1-12, Kenya 2-8-9-10-11, Ethiopia 3-4-13 and USA 5-6-7.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 5 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 19:30"

The reigning champion from 2013 Meseret Defar was absent from the competition, having not yet returned from a career break to start a family.\nSummary.\nFrom the gun in the final, the two Japanese runner Misaki Onishi then Ayuko Suzuki took the pace out at a serious level, the women running the same pace as the pedestrian men's race through the first 2,000. After her 1500 metres win and world record, all eyes were clearly on Genzebe Dibaba. On the first lap Dibaba went to the back of the pack. After a lap she decided to move in behind the Japanese runners. Instantly she was marked by world leader Almaz Ayana. Three laps into the race, it was a string of African runners behind the Japanese, with a gap back to all the other non-Africans. From the pace of just under 74 seconds a lap, Ayana then upped the pace, followed immediately by Dibaba and the Kenyan team running as a group led by returning silver medalist Mercy Cherono. Laps started getting quicker, 68, 67, the field stringing out 65, 64 first only Dibaba was able to follow Ayana, then she was broken, Ayana out into an insurmountable lead with three laps to go and still accelerating. More than a hundred metres behind, Senbere Teferi was battling the last of the Kenyans, Viola Kibiwot for the bronze medal position. Ayana slowed a little over the last two laps, the pace falling back to 67 seconds but the damage was done and the race was decided. Ayana pushed home in 14:26.83 to break Genzebe's sister Tirunesh Dibaba's Championship Record. Well behind, Genzebe was content to just finish the race in silver medal position, but the battle for bronze was accelerating. Onto the home stretch, Teferi put her best move on Kibiwot and was sprinting home, but in the process she passed the slowing Dibaba. Dibaba finally noticed Teferi passing and turned into sprinting making for a close finish but Teferi had the edge and took the silver medal.\nIt was a sweep for Ethiopia but not from a tactical situation like many Kenyan team members try to run. These were three rivals who in the process of beating each other, beat the rest of the world. Behind them, the straightaway was empty, it took 15 more seconds for the next Kenyan runner to arrive.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 5 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 19:15"

The Kenyan triumvirate of Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor, Paul Kipngetich Tanui and Bedan Karoki Muchiri took the race out, multiple 64 second laps breaking the race apart to the point that there were only two remaining stragglers, Farah and his American training partner Galen Rupp. Farah, Rupp and Tanui were all returning from top 5 finishes two years earlier. As the pace dropped, Farah briefly showed his intent to win with 3200, 1500 and 1200 to go, but each time Farah poked into the lead the Kenyan team quickly scrambled to retake the lead. Then with 500 metres to go to the finish, Farah boldly launched his long assault for the finish. \nIn championship races, long sprints to the finish usually lead to defeat as the more sprint inclined racers are able to run down the breakaway near the finish, but Farah held the lead as the three, then two Kenyan rivals jockeyed for position to catch him. In the final turn as he was maneuvering through traffic, Kipsang got close enough to clip Farah's heels, with Farah stumbling and almost falling. \nFarah stayed on his feet with Kipsang close behind, then Tanui managed to pull even with Kipsang through the final turn. Coming into the final straight, World Cross Country champion Kipsang looked like he would be able to swing around Farah to victory, but a determined Farah instead accelerated pulling away to a clear win, celebrating as he crossed the finish line. Farah's final lap time was 54.15. For the second time in a row, Tanui found himself in bronze medal position.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nThe race was started at 20:50."

The field adjusted for the final kick through the turn, Gelete Burka the first to pounce as soon as they reached the back stretch. Betsy Saina fell off the back but the rest stayed in close order drill. It took Vivian Cheruiyot another 50 metres to get pas Huddle then she quickly moved to Burka's shoulder, literally bumping shoulders a couple of times as they entered the turn. Cheruiyot moved past Burka who then followed Cheruiyot through the turn repositioning herself for a final kick coming off the turn. Burka made her move, with 100 meters to go Cheruiyot looked directly into Burka's eyes and the battle was on. For the next 50 meters they raced with Cheruiyot always maintaining the edge. Then it was clear Burka would not get there and the gap opened as Burka struggled. Huddle continued chasing, losing ground to the leaders. Behind her Emily Infeld was sprinting and moved past a celebrating Huddle just one meter before the finish line. \nThe top 9 runners were from just three countries.

In that same meet, Olympic Champion Christian Taylor was only 2 cm behind to equal the previous #3, who was the defending world champion Teddy Tamgho. Tamgho was also in Doha, finishing in third behind the fireworks, but Tamgho was coming off a 1-year drug suspension for missing multiple tests. Following that meet, two weeks later Pichardo improved his world lead to 18.08 at home in Havana and then in early July, Taylor improved to 18.06 and beat Pichardo in Lausanne.

Tamgho did not return to defend the championship in Beijing.\nIn the qualification round, only Marian Oprea made an automatic qualifier on his first attempt, it took Taylor two and Pichardo three but there was no doubt either would make the final. In the final Pichardo took the first round lead with 17.52, Taylor made 17.49 on his second attempt and both jumped exactly 17.60 in the third round.

Neither made it giving Drouin the gold and leaving a tie for silver. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: 2.31 m (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q).\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 18:30"

        "text": "The women's high jump at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Beijing National Stadium on 27 and 29 August.\nIt took 1.92 to make the finals, and eight competitors made it cleanly. In the finals, only eight cleared 1.92; Ana Šimić, Doreen Amata, and Levern Spencer, who had jumped it in qualification, missed three times. 1.95 lost Jeanelle Scheper and Eleanor Patterson, but the remaining six all made it through three heights to 1.99. Two-time champion Blanka Vlašić looked like her dominant self from six years earlier with a large clearance at 2.01, but she had one failure at 1.92. Mariya Kuchina, whose best achievement had been a tie for the World Indoor Championship, cleared it next as a personal best, and she was still clean. The 2012 Olympic champion Anna Chicherova cleared it on her second attempt. Kamila Lićwinko (the other half of that tie), returning bronze medalist Ruth Beitia, and Marie-Laurence Jungfleisch were unable to make 2.01, so the medals were settled. The bar went up to 2.03, but nobody could make it, so the results were decided by the count back. Chicherova needed two attempts at the winning height, so she finished third. Of the two who made it their first time, that mistake earlier in the competition gave Vlašić another silver medal (her fourth in major competition), while Kuchina's perfect series was rewarded with the gold medal. \nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: 1.94 m (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q).\nFinal.\nThe final started at 18:30."

He cleared it with one foot to spare on his first attempt. It is believed to be the highest opening height ever attempted. At the end of that round, only six jumpers remained and three others, Shawnacy Barber, Piotr Lisek and 2011 winner Paweł Wojciechowski also had no misses. Returning champion Raphael Holzdeppe also was one of the six to clear 5.80, including several misses.\nAt the next height, 5.90, Lavillenie cleared the bar easily, but in the wrong position. Each time he knocked it off on his way down. Barber, the National High School Record holder and NCAA Champion from the University of Akron, cleared on his first attempt. On his last attempt Holzdeppe cleared 5.90 to stay in the competition, leaving a three-way tie for the bronze medal between Wojciechowski, Lisek, and Lavillenie. \nBarber and Holzdeppe competed for the gold medal at a height of 6.00; both athletes failed to clear it on all three attempts, neither really getting off a serious attempt. Barber's initial success at 5.90 in the previous round gave him the gold medal over Holzdeppe.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: 5.70 m (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q).\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 19:05."

Both Silva and Murer made 4.85 on their first attempt, giving Murer the lead. Murer also again equalled her own South American record. Kyriakopoulou missed at what would have been her National Record. Having no strategic advantage to clearing it with one miss, she passed to 4.90.

Murer was unable to answer on her final attempt and had to settle for silver. Murer was pleased to win a medal in Beijing seven years after the 2008 Olympics, where she underperformed following her poles being misplaced by the organization, and became optimistic for the 2016 Summer Olympics at her own Brazil, when she will have to set a masters world record to be in the medal hunt.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the established records were as follows.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: 4.60 m (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q).\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 19:00."

The league was established by nine commercial teams, some of which have played in the PBA D-League. The chairman of the league was Buddy Encarnado, who was also the board governor representing the Sta. Lucia Realtors during its stint in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA).\nThe PCBL was sanctioned and officiated by the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP), the Philippine governing body of basketball. The league was tasked by the SBP to form the national basketball teams that will participate in the Southeast Asia Basketball (SEABA) and the Southeast Asian Games, replacing the Gilas Cadets program.\nHistory.\nThe league envisioned a three-conference first season (2015-2016). Its inaugural conference, the Founders Cup, began on October 11, 2015. The games were held at the Pasig City Sports Center and Filoil Flying V Arena. Games are aired on AksyonTV on a delayed basis.\nThe second conference, which started in March 2016, was envisioned to be an import-reinforced tournament, while the third conference called the Commissioner's Cup will be an invitational tournament, and the fourth conference Homegrown Cup will be an All-Filipino conference. The PCBL also planned to have out-of-town games in Baguio, Lipa, Batangas and Lucena.\nThe PCBL's second conference was headed by four returning teams - Jumbo Plastic Linoleum Giants, Euro-Med, Supremo Lex Builders, Foton, Sta. Lucia Realty, and new teams, Mighty Sports and SCTEX Road Warriors.\nOn May 27, 2016, the 2016 PCBL Chairman's Cup title was awarded to Jumbo Plastic Linoleum Giants, setting the first record for back to back championship wins for the Pilipinas Commercial Basketball League, after beating the star-studded Mighty Sports 80–68 on game 3.\nPCBL champions.\nEven though the league only operated for several months, the league crowned Jumbo Plastic Linoleum Giants as its champions for both conferences in its one and only season."

        "text": "Julian King is an American retired professional basketball player who most recently was the head coach for the Saint John Mill Rats of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL). He played at the collegiate level with Temple and Coppin State after graduating Dodge County High School. As a pro player, King has experience competing in various minor leagues across the United States, multiple NBA camps, and in countries such as Mexico, Germany, Switzerland, Paraguay, and Argentina. He is currently a trainer based in Bethesda, Maryland.\nHigh school career.\nKing attended Dodge County High School in Eastman, Georgia, where he played basketball as a wing forward. In his senior season, he averaged 20 points and 8 rebounds. King chose to play college basketball for Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after meeting the academic requirements.\nCollegiate career.\nKing played with the Temple Owls men's basketball team under Hall of Fame head coach John Chaney for his first two seasons. He transferred to Coppin State as a junior and remained there for his final year. In 1997, King and David Houston, who went on to become the head coach of West Potomac High School, powered the Eagles to second round appearance at the NCAA Tournament. At Coppin State, King was coached by Fang Mitchell, who he considered to be a future Hall of Famer.\nProfessional career.\nKing competed with the Magic City Snowbears of the International Basketball Association (IBA) from 1999 to 2000. He played under head coach Rob Spon, whom he would later cross paths with in his own coaching career. From 2006 to 2007, he served as a player-coach with the Boston Frenzy of the American Basketball Association (ABA). In early February 2007, King signed with the Quad City Riverhawks, who also played in the ABA. However, he was waived just over a week later after suffering a broken finger. The move eventually ended King's playing career.\nCoaching career.\nT. C. Williams High School.\nFollowing his retirement from playing basketball, King decided to return to the court as a coach, so that he could mentor young players and pass on his own knowledge. He also approached the idea because it provided him with a \"mental challenge.\" King was initially a physical education teacher at a private school in Washington, D.C. However, he landed an assistant coaching job at T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia in 2007. While on the Titans' staff in his first season, King's team won the Virginia AAA state championship. In July 2008, head coach Ivan Thomas announced his resignation and King began assuming his position. He inherited a high school basketball program that went 78–11 overall and a perfect 52–0 in the Patriot District in Thomas's final three years at its helm. The former coach said, \"Are you really feeling the pressure of winning back-to-back? The thing he has to do is be Julian King, not Ivan Thomas. He'll be fine, regardless of what people say...I think Julian will do a great job here.\" King would spend six seasons at T. C Williams, leading the school to 3 district titles, 2 Northern Region championships and 2 appearances at the state tournament. In his final year, the Titans finished with a 4–16 record. In mid-March 2014, he resigned as the team's head coach. Athletics director Steve Colantuoni said, \"Julian's been very successful here, so it did kind of take me aback when he resigned. But we’re grateful for all he's done\" Over that summer, King was an advance scout with the Connecticut Sun of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).\nSaint John Mill Rats.\nOn August 12, 2014, King was announced as the head coach of the Saint John Mill Rats, a professional team from the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL). The former coach, Rob Spon, joined the Rochester Razorsharks of the PBL. Spon considered hiring King as an assistant coach with the Razorsharks if he was not approached by the Mill Rats. By the end of the season, King led Saint John to a 17–15 regular season record and a semifinals appearance in the playoffs. On May 7, 2015, King was replaced by Spon, who returned to the Mill Rats organization after leading Rochester to a PBL championship and an undefeated season.\nTraining career.\nFollowing his departure from the Saint John Mill Rats, King became a basketball instructor at E-Train University, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland. Other members of the program included former Clemson college player Dave Potter, ex-Richmond Spider Eric Poole, and Boston Celtics draft pick and player Junior Burrough."

        "text": "Samuel H. Kennedy (born 1973) is an American professional baseball executive who is the president and chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) and CEO of Fenway Sports Group (FSG).\nEarly life and education.\nThe son of an Episcopal priest, Kennedy is a native of Brookline, Massachusetts. He attended Brookline High School and was a classmate of Theo Epstein, later an executive with the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. At Brookline High School, Kennedy was captain of both the boys' hockey and baseball teams. He then attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where he played baseball and earned a bachelor's degree in 1995.\nCareer.\nAfter an internship with the New York Yankees in 1995, and a period in advertising sales with two major New York City radio stations, WABC and WFAN, Kennedy returned to baseball in 1996 with the San Diego Padres, where he worked under Larry Lucchino and was reunited with Epstein.\nKennedy began his San Diego career as an account executive, and had risen to executive director/corporate accounts and broadcasting when (along with Lucchino and, eventually, Epstein) he joined the Red Sox front office during the 2001–02 offseason upon the team's purchase by Fenway Sports Group (FSG). He rose from vice president/sales and corporate partnerships to senior vice president/sales and marketing to executive vice president/chief marketing officer before becoming the Red Sox' chief operating officer.\nKennedy also worked to enlarge the footprint of parent company FSG. In 2004, working under chief operating officer Mike Dee, he was tasked with the creation of Fenway Sports Management (FSM), a sports marketing agency that operates under the aegis of the Fenway Sports Group, where he served as president following Dee's 2009 departure and subsequently as chief executive officer. In 2010, Kennedy was involved in FSG's purchase of the Premier League association football club Liverpool F.C., with FSM placed in charge of expanding the club's global \"commercial operations.\" Kennedy was considered for top-level positions in sports management outside Boston and baseball, including a possible higher-management role with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment in Toronto, prior to the 2015 season.\nKennedy was named the successor to longtime Red Sox president Lucchino on August 1, 2015, when Lucchino announced his decision to retire from his executive positions at the close of the team's 2015 season. Lucchino's CEO post was initially left vacant, and on August 18, 2015, the Red Sox also named veteran MLB executive Dave Dombrowski to the new position of president, baseball operations. On August 2, 2017, the Red Sox and FSM announced Kennedy's appointment as CEO, and signed him to a new five-year contract as both CEO and president. In March 2021, FSG announced that Kennedy had joined its ownership group and become a partner. Three years later, Kennedy was promoted to FSG's chief executive post.\nPersonal life.\nKennedy and his family reside in Wellesley, Massachusetts."

Birch's performances were inconsistent, but such inconsistency was enough to warrant his position as a middle-ranked 'journeyman' player; he appeared in the last 16 at the 1997 European Open in 1996–97, where again, he lost to Hendry, this time 5–3. At the end of the next season, he reached his career-highest ranking of 42nd.\nIn the 1997 Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, Birch played Mark Fenton in the last 128, compiling three century breaks in five frames as he beat the Welshman 5–4; Birch would progress to the quarter-final, where he lost 1–5 to another Welshman, Paul Davies.\nHe defeated a declining Steve Davis 5–2 en route to losing to Ali Carter by the same scoreline in the last 32 of the 1999 Grand Prix; Birch had made a 52 break in the final frame against Carter but lost it 59–69.\nBirch maintained sufficient form to hold a position within the top 50 in the rankings until 2003, but slipped to 64th at the end of the 2003/2004 season, and after dropping a further twenty places to 84th during the next, was relegated from the tour in 2005, aged 37."

        "text": "The 2016 Major League Lacrosse season was the 16th season of Major League Lacrosse. The season featured 9 teams (all in the United States) after the addition of the Atlanta Blaze via expansion. It was the first season since 2008 that the league fielded more than eight teams. The defending champion New York Lizards were coming off their third Steinfeld Cup victory in franchise history and first since 2003 after defeating the Rochester Rattlers 15–12 August 8, 2015 at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw, Georgia. On August 20, the Denver Outlaws won their second Steinfeld Cup trophy in three years, coming back to defeat the Ohio Machine, 19–18.\nThe 2016 season was a particularly unusual one. Going into the final week of the regular season, all four playoff spots were still up for grabs. In the end, seven teams finished at 8–6. With the tiebreaker procedures, the teams that were rewarded with a playoff berth were the Ohio Machine, New York Lizards, Denver Outlaws (who had started the season 2–6), and the Charlotte Hounds. The 8–6 teams left out of the postseason were the Boston Cannons, Chesapeake Bayhawks, and Rochester Rattlers. 2016 was the first season since the season expanded to 14 games and no team finished with more than eight wins.\nAll Star Game.\nThe 2016 All Star Game took place in Orange County, California at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium on July 9. In the first professional lacrosse game in Southern California since the Los Angeles Riptide left, Team Riptide narrowly defeated Team Rolling Thunder, 21–20 in front of 4,217 fans. Goaltender for the Ohio Machine and Team Riptide, Scotty Rodgers, went onto win the MVP award.\nPlayoffs.\nOn March 9, the league announced the two semifinals games would be held at separate neutral locations for the first time ever. One (Denver vs. New York) was held in Fairfield, Connecticut, and the other (Charlotte vs. Ohio) was held in Blaine, Minnesota. For the third straight year, the championship game was held at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Atlanta."

A sharp, off-camber turn at Rocketts Landing brought the riders to the narrow, twisty, cobbled climb up to Libby Hill Park in the historic Church Hill neighborhood. A quick descent, followed by three hard turns led to a climb up 23rd Street. Once atop this steep cobbled hill, riders descended into Shockoe Bottom.

The Belgian team, composed of Bruynooghe and Das who were ranked 46th and 60th in Europe, defeated 2005 WPA World Nine-ball Championship winner Wu Jia-qing and world championship semi-finalist Yang Ching-shun from Taiwan 8–6. The defending champion Filipino team completed a 8–0 whitewash over the Croatians. France and China were tied at 5–5 before Vincent Faquet completed a to lead 6–5. During the next two racks, the French failed to escape from allowing the Chinese team of Li Hewen and Fu Jianbo to win them before they rack 13 for victory. The Singapore team also defeated Austria 8–2, for all four quarter-finalists in the top half coming from Asia.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 29 September as a race to nine racks. Japan defeated Singapore 9–5 in the first quarter-final, making jokes throughout the match to the crowd. In rack 10, Ōi made a three ball to pot the on the first shot after the break, both players jumping up and down in celebration after the shot. Having defeated the Taiwan team in the second round, the Belgian duo were \"drained\" according to reporters, and were only able to win four racks against Canada. The Filipino pair were defeated by the Chinese team 6–9. The Chinese team took an early four rack lead, but their lead was reduced to 7–6. In rack 14, Reyes missed a simple shot on the , and China won the rack, before running rack 15. The last quarter-final saw Finland's Mika Immonen and Markus Juva defeat Switzerland 9–4.\nThe semi-finals were played on 30 September as a race to nine racks. The first semi-final saw the 10th seeded Finland play the 11th seeded Canadian team. Finland won the , but made a in the opening rack. They still won the opening rack, and retained the break throughout the match as they won 9–0. The Canadian team only played nine shots in the entire match. The other semi-final match was played between China, seeded 8th, and the unseeded Japanese team. The Chinese team ran the first two racks, before three players missed a shot at the 9-ball in rack three; Hewen finally potted to increase the lead to 3–0. China then won four of the next five racks to lead 7–1. Hewen missed a shot on the the following rack allowing Japan to the table, who won the next three racks. China capitalised on a missed to win the next two racks, and complete a 9–4 victory.\nThe final was also played on 30 September, but as a race-to-11 racks. The Chinese team of Hewen and Jianbo met the Finland pair of Juva and Immonen. The final had many dry breaks, six in the first 15 racks, there having been just ten in the rest of the tournament. There was just one rack between the two sides until China led 6–4 and then 7–5. China won three of the next four to go to the , leading 10–6. The Finland team then won four straight frames to level the match at 10–10. At the table in the deciding rack, Immonen potted a ball from the break, and left a combination shot for Juva to pot the 9-ball to win the tournament; the shot did not come off, and the Chinese pair ran the rest of the rack to win the tournament.\nMain draw.\nBelow are the results from the event.

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The 2022 Winter Olympics took place between the 4 and 20 February 2022 and were hosted by in China in the capital city of Beijing. The country selected was the subject of various concerns and controversies about their cost, environmental impact, censorship, espionage, COVID-19, sportswashing, and human rights issues.\nThere have been diplomatic boycotts of the Olympics largely due to the human rights situation in China, and the persecution of Uyghurs in China in particular. Additional reasons for diplomatic boycotts include China's alleged politicization of the games.\nCriticism of host selection.\nAmerican sportscaster Bob Costas criticized the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) decision to award the games to China saying \"The IOC deserves all of the disdain and disgust that comes their way for going back to China yet again\" referencing China's human rights record.\nAfter winning two gold medals and returning to his home country of Sweden skater Nils van der Poel criticized the IOC's selection of China as the host saying \"I think it is extremely irresponsible to give it to a country that violates human rights as blatantly as the Chinese regime is doing.\" He had declined to criticize China before leaving for the games saying \"I don't think it would be particularly wise for me to criticize the system I'm about to transition to, if I want to live a long and productive life.\"\nOrganizing concerns and controversies.\nCost and climate.\nSeveral cities withdrew their applications during the bidding process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support to host the 2022 games, leaving Almaty in Kazakhstan and Beijing as the only candidate cities by 1 October 2014.\nThe decision to bid for the Olympics was controversial in China (and outside), because Beijing itself, and especially some of the proposed outdoor venues, would not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.\nPromotional song.\nSome commentators alleged that one of the early promotional songs for the 2022 Winter Olympics, \"The Snow and Ice Dance\", sung by Sun Nan and Tan Jing, had suspicious similarities with \"Let It Go\", one of the songs from the 2013 Disney film, \"Frozen\". A Chinese media outlet cited technical analysis of the two songs: both songs employ a piano as the major instrument, have similar prelude chords and an eight-beat introduction, and they run at almost exactly the same tempo.\nDiplomatic boycotts or non-attendance.\n&lt;section begin=boycotts /&gt;\nSeveral countries declined to send any diplomats or official representatives to the games. The following countries have either specifically called their non-attendance a \"boycott\" or have explicitly stated that their non-attendance is due to human rights concerns:\nThe following countries and regions also did not send any official representatives, but stated that their non-attendance was due to the COVID-19 pandemic or explicitly denied that they considered their non-attendance to be a diplomatic boycott:\n&lt;section end=boycotts /&gt;\nSpecifically:\nBackground.\nAfter China had won the bid to host the 2022 Olympics, many Tibetan protesters had criticized the IOC for allowing China to host the games again due to its policies against Tibetans. In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers, the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, China's hostage diplomacy and the persecution of Uyghurs in China, calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Games. In November 2021 the disappearance of former Olympian Peng Shuai after she made allegations of sexual assault against Zhang Gaoli, former Vice Premier of China and a high ranking Chinese Communist Party (CCP) member, has put pressure on the International Olympic Committee.\nSome human rights organizations have called for a diplomatic boycott that would mean countries not sending their heads of state or high-ranking officials to the Olympics but still sending athletes. In a 30 July 2020 letter, the World Uyghur Congress urged the IOC to reconsider holding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of the Uyghur genocide. The World Uyghur Congress does not support a full boycott; instead, they want athletes to use the games as a chance to raise awareness about the Uyghur genocide, similar to the way that athletes have raised the profile of the Black Lives Matter movement. The IOC met with activists in late 2020 about their request to move the Olympics. In March 2021, the IOC president Thomas Bach opposed a boycott, which would also damage the IOC image and finances, and said that the IOC must stay out of politics. On 14 October 2021, the executive vice-president of the IOC, John Coates, said that the IOC would not challenge the Chinese government over the issue of the Uyghurs, stating that it was \"not within the IOC's remit\".\nOn 23 June 2021 (Olympic Day), multiple Tibetan, Uyghur, Hongkonger, Chinese, Taiwanese and Southern Mongolian representatives staged protests in 50 cities worldwide, calling for a mass boycott.\nOn 7 September 2021, human rights groups called on Olympics broadcasters, including NBC, to cancel the broadcasting plans for 2022 Olympics due to China's human rights issue.\nIn January 2022, it was reported that the United States is considering legislation to strip the IOC of its federal tax-exempt status in response to the IOC's \"refusal to challenge China on human rights abuses\".\nMore than 200 human rights organizations have voiced support for a boycott of the games. Groups protesting the games have called them the \"Genocide Games.\"\nUnited States.\nIn October 2018, Senator Marco Rubio, on behalf of the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China, asked that China be deprived of the hosting rights for the 2022 Olympics due to the \"dire human rights situation\" there. In September 2020, United States Senator Rick Scott spoke with the IOC Vice President about reconsidering the IOC's decision to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in China. On 25 February 2021, U.S. Representative John Katko stated that China is \"a country that's engaged in genocide\" and called upon the United States to boycott participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics. In March 2021, Senator Mitt Romney called for an \"economic and diplomatic boycott\" of the 2022 Winter Olympics, in which U.S. athletes would still participate, but no American spectators or dignitaries would attend. In May 2021, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called for a diplomatic boycott and said heads of state should not \"honor China\" by attending the Olympic Games. In July 2021, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China called on the IOC to relocate or postpone the games.\nIn April 2021, it was reported that the Biden administration was \"not discussing any joint boycott with allies and partners.\"\nIn a survey taken in August 2021, 49 per cent of Americans believe that China's human rights record should prevent it from hosting the winter Olympics in 2022 and 33 per cent are not sure.\nOn 18 November 2021, President Joe Biden said the U.S. is \"considering\" a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Some, like US senator Tom Cotton, called for a full boycott of the games, which would bar U.S. athletes from competing and bar U.S. companies from sponsoring the games. Due to a change in the last version of the Olympic Charter, a full boycott by the United States, like the one at the 1980 Summer Olympics, could result in the most severe punishment, which is the suspension by the National Olympic Committee for 2 years of the Olympic Games, a similar situation to what happened with North Korea in the 2020 games.\nOn 6 December 2021, White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, announced that the Biden administration would initiate a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2022 Winter Paralympics. The diplomatic boycott would bar all US government officials from attending the games in an official capacity. The White House cited China's mistreatment of the Uyghur people as the reason for the boycott. The White House said it stopped short of a full boycott, because \"it would not be fair to punish athletes who have trained for years\".\nOn 27 December 2021, the Chinese foreign ministry said it has received visa applications for 18 US officials to attend the games. The US said that the visa applications were consistent with its diplomatic boycott as the applicants would only be providing \"consular and diplomatic security services\" to its athletes.\nAustralia.\nChina's alleged use of coercive diplomacy against Australia has led to increased calls within Australia to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics. In November 2020, Australian Senators Jacqui Lambie and Rex Patrick officially proposed a boycott, but their proposal was voted down. Australia has decided that no Australian based politician or officials will be attending the games, and Canberra has also refused to sign the Olympic Truce for the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nOn 7 December 2021, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that Australia would join with the United States in the diplomatic boycott of the 2022 games. He stated that it was \"human rights abuses,\" referencing the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, as well as \"many other issues that Australia has consistently raised\". He went on to state that it was \"no surprise\" that Canberra would do this following consistent deterioration of relations between Canberra and Beijing. Morrison also stated that the decision was \"in Australia's national interest,\" and that it is the \"right thing to do.\"\nIndia.\nAfter it was revealed that People's Liberation Army regimental commander Qi Fabao, who led the Chinese troops during skirmishes against Indian troops during the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, would be one of the torchbearers during the opening ceremony of the games, Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi stated: \"It is indeed regrettable that the Chinese side has chosen to politicize an event like the Olympics\". Bagchi also stated that the \"chargé d'affaires\" of the Embassy of India in Beijing will not attend the opening or closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. The CEO of Prasar Bharati, India's public broadcaster, announced that they will not air the 2022 Winter Olympics opening and closing ceremony.\nQi Fabao had been captured in June 2020 by Indian forces when he tried to mount an attack on Indian forces in the Galwan Valley, according to an investigative report by the Australian newspaper \"The Klaxon\". According to the report, 38 Chinese troops drowned in the early stages of the 15–16 June face-off between Indian and Chinese forces while attempting to cross the Galwan River at Line of Actual Control in the dark. The Chinese government accepted four casualties.\nCalls for boycotts by other countries.\nIn a non-binding motion in February 2021, the Canadian House of Commons called for the IOC to move the Olympics to a new location. In a nationwide survey conducted in March 2021, 54% of Canadians said the country should boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, while 24% believed it should not and 21% were not sure.\nIn July 2021, the European Parliament and the Parliament of the United Kingdom voted in favor of a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nOn 19 November 2021, 17 members of the Lithuanian national parliament Seimas released an official letter encouraging Lithuania to withdraw from the 2022 Olympics due human rights violations in China. Daina Gudzinevičiūtė, president of National Olympic Committee of Lithuania, released a statement that Olympic games should be politically neutral and confirmed that committee has no plans to boycott the games. Lithuania's president, Gitanas Nauseda, released a statement confirming the Lithuanian diplomatic boycott on 3 December 2021. This was due to concerns of human rights abuses in China.\nOn 8 December 2021, the United Kingdom and Canada joined the United States and Australia, whom both announced diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nIn December 2021, the government of Latvia announced that it would not send diplomats to the games.\nIn January 2022, the governments of Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands separately announced that they will not send diplomats to the games.\nChinese Government response.\nIn February 2021, the Chinese Communist Party-owned tabloid \"Global Times\" warned that China could \"seriously sanction any country that follows a boycott.\" In March 2021, Chinese spokesperson Guo Weimin stated that any attempt to boycott the Olympics would be doomed to fail. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also told the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that they should attend the games to \"enhance exchanges on winter sport,\" and to \"foster new highlights\" in bilateral cooperation.\nOn 29 November 2021, Chinese media reported that China reportedly does not plan to invite Western politicians who threaten a diplomatic boycott to the Beijing Winter Olympics.\nIOC response.\nThe IOC has stated that the diplomatic boycotts are \"a purely political decision for each government, which the IOC in its political neutrality fully respects.\" It has also stated that the award of hosting the games does not signal agreement with the host country's political or social situation or its human rights standards. When prompted by Agence France-Presse, the IOC responded: \"We've repeatedly said it: the IOC isn't responsible for the government. It only gives the rights and opportunity for the staging of the Olympic Games. That doesn't mean we agree with all the politics, all the social or human rights issues in the country. And it doesn't mean we approve of all the human rights violations of a person or people.\" This position has generated criticism, with Jules Boykoff accusing the IOC of hypocrisy by saying that it ignores its charter that promotes equality and anti-discrimination when it is convenient to do so and that the IOC has shown an \"unfortunate propensity for turning away from human rights atrocities to make sure that the games go on.\"\nOn 8 September 2021, after the IOC suspended the North Korean NOC for not being present at the 2020 Summer Olympics, there was speculation about whether the IOC was also intending to send a message to nations considering a boycott of the games that they could be banned from participation in future Olympic Games if they chose to boycott this edition. On 14 October 2021, the executive vice-president of the IOC, Australian John Coates, said that the IOC would not challenge the Chinese government over the issue of the Uyghurs, stating that it was \"not within the IOC's remit\".\nHowever, during the opening ceremony, IOC president, Thomas Bach had called for the end of various types of discrimination during his speech indirectly referring to the human rights abuses in China. On 17 February 2022 towards the end of the Games, when a BOCOG spokesperson referred to questions about Xinjiang as \"lies\", the IOC reminded BOCOG to remain politically neutral.\nAthletes and team officials complaints.\nAthletes participating have said, the games \"are not living up to the hype — especially considering how China promised the world a \"streamlined, safe and most splendid Games.\" Team officials from delegations including Belgium, Germany and the Russian Olympic Committee have all brought up issues facing their athletes in quarantine hotels, among them no internet, low-quality food, insufficient facilities and no training equipment.\nQuarantine facilities.\nPolish short track speed skater Natalia Maliszewska posted on Twitter, \"I don't believe in anything anymore. In no tests. No games. It's a big joke for me\" after a series of mistakes by Chinese officials conducting COVID-19 tests on her. Meanwhile, Finnish men's ice hockey team's coach Jukka Jalonen accused China of not respecting the human rights of athlete Marko Anttila, who had not received food and was under a lot of stress while in quarantine.\nOn February 2, Belgian skeleton athlete Kim Meylemans posted on social media and was in tears about the conditions she faced while in quarantine. Meylemans was supposed to be transported to the village after her time in quarantine was over, but was transported to a different quarantine facility instead. After the video was posted, Belgian Olympic team officials and the International Olympic Committee had to intervene, and Meylemans was moved to the Athletes Village in Yanqing. Moreover, Dirk Schimmelpfennig, Germany's chef de mission called the hotel accommodations provided for Olympic gold medalist in Nordic Combined Eric Frenzel as \"unreasonable\".\nFood.\nThe food being served at the games was also criticized. During the men's downhill event in alpine skiing, German coach Christian Schweiger said the following, \"the catering is extremely questionable. I would have expected that the Olympic Committee is capable of providing hot meals, there are crisps, some nuts and chocolate and nothing else. This shows a lack of focus on high-performance sport\". Also, Russian Olympic Committee biathlete Valeria Vasnetsova posted on social media that she was served the same food for all three meals and posted \"My stomach hurts, I'm very pale and I have huge black circles around my eyes\". Vasnetsova said she was only able to eat the pasta served as the rest of the food was inedible. The United States delegation brought extra food, such as bags of pasta, anticipating issues with the food at the games. Also, a manager from a restaurant in the \"bubble\" for the games admitted the food served there was \"disgusting\" and only low quality packaged food items were available at the Main Media Centre. The International Olympic Committee would release a statement acknowledging the issues raised by athletes, \"particularly with regard to food temperature, variety and portion size\".\nWeather conditions.\nOther complaints included the weather conditions at the games, with athletes raising complaints about competing in unsafe weather conditions. The Swedish team requested the races be moved to earlier in the day to protect athletes from the cold weather. This was done after athlete Frida Karlsson nearly fainted at the conclusion of the women's skiathlon cross-country race. Some athletes resorted to putting tape on their faces and noses to protect them from the bitter cold.\nTeam Russia.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA will allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2022 Winter Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The title of the neutral banner was yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.\nRussia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020, to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed from four to two years. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.\nThe IOC announced on 19 February 2021 that Russia would compete in both the 2020 Summer Olympics (which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2022 Winter Olympics under the acronym \"ROC\", after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. On 22 April 2021, the IOC approved a fragment of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 to be used in place of the Russian national anthem.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine.\nRussia was criticized for its troops build-up near the Ukrainian border. There were also calls to remove Russia from the Olympic sports committees. On 24 February 2022, president Vladimir Putin commenced a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, resulting in further sporting sanctions against Russia. Many news outlets have alleged that China suggested to Russia not to conduct the latter's invasion on Ukraine before the conclusion of the Beijing Olympics.\nEnvironmental and health issues.\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in qualifying for curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. The World Curling Federation proposed that qualification for curling be based on placement in the 2021 world championships and a dedicated qualification tournament to complete the field (in place of points earned across the 2020 and 2021 world championships). The IIHF based its qualification for the women's tournament upon existing IIHF World Rankings, without holding the 2020 Women's World Championship. The Asian Winter Games was also not held before this Olympics, potentially affecting the qualifications for some athletes.\nOn 23 December 2021, the National Hockey League (NHL) announced it will not be sending players to the Games, citing health and safety concerns, and a need to use the timeframe of the Olympics to make up the large number of games postponed since December 2021 due to Omicron variant.\nInsufficient snowfall.\nDuring the bidding process, critics questioned the Beijing bid, citing that the proposed outdoor venue sites do not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.\nEnergy crisis.\nThe 2021 global energy crisis has intensified pressures on China ahead of the Winter Olympics. Al-Jazeera reported that \"China's energy crisis is partially of its own making as President Xi Jinping tries to ensure blue skies at the Winter Olympics in Beijing next February and show the international community he's serious about de-carbonizing the economy.\"\nImpact on Songshan National Nature Reserve.\nThe environmental impact of hosting the Games near Beijing has been questioned. Some of the proposed venues will be adjacent to the Songshan National Nature Reserve and part of the same mountain system, and the environmental impact on the nature reserve of construction, and artificially covering parts of the mountain with snow, is uncertain. The Government of China has responded to these concerns by expanding the nature reserve by 31% of its original size.\nHuman rights issues.\nConcerns over China's human rights record have cast a shadow over Beijing's Olympic Games, including a diplomatic boycott over serious human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the country. Rights experts stated that crackdowns on human rights defenders, which can range from closing social media accounts to enforced disappearances, were typical in the lead up to sensitive events in China, where the Chinese Communist Party kept a tight lid on dissent.\nSportswashing.\nCritics say that the 2022 Winter Olympics is being used by the Chinese government for the purpose of sportswashing, a practice by which a country uses sporting events to distract from human rights abuses or other issues.\nIn January 2022 Amnesty International warned the international community against participating in China's sportswashing efforts. According to Amnesty \"China is hoping for sportswashing gold and it's vital that every effort is made to counteract that.\" Amnesty also criticized the IOC directly.\nAccording to Amnesty International, Swedish Olympic champion Nils van der Poel gave his Beijing 2022 gold medal to the daughter of a Hong Kong dissident to protest the Chinese Government's devastating human rights record. He won the gold medal in men's 10,000 metre speed skating.\nAthlete safety.\nMembers of the American congress from both major parties have expressed concerns about athlete safety. Retired Olympic cross-country skier Noah Hoffman has also expressed concerns about athlete safety citing China's human rights record and a lack of concern shown by the IOC.\nAthlete's freedom of speech.\nIn January 2022 the Beijing Organizing Committee warned that \"Any behavior or speech that is against the Olympic spirit, especially against Chinese laws and regulations, are also subject to certain punishment.\"\nCompetitors have been warned by Human Rights Watch that speaking out is not tolerated in China and as a result if they speak out about human rights or other issues in China they face significant legal penalties. For their protection the American team has been shielded from question related to human rights.\nUyghur and Tibetan activists have encouraged athletes, sponsors, and other international participants in the games to use the platform to speak out on human rights.\nProtests.\nOn 18 October 2021 activists from Free Tibet and Students for a Free Tibet disrupted the Olympic flame lighting ceremony at Olympia in Greece. Three people, Chemi Lhamo, Fern MacDougal and Jason Leith, were arrested and detained for several days. They were charged and their trial was set to occur immediately before the games opened but it was immediately adjourned and a new date set for 1 December 2022.\nIn November 2021 activists held a 57-hour vigil outside the White House in Washington D.C.\nIn January 2022 a protest against China's hosting of the games was held in Washington, D.C. outside the Chinese embassy. Attendees included civil rights activist Chen Guangcheng and New Jersey politician Chris Smith. Smith described the 2022 Olympics as the \"Genocide Games.\"\nTo protest the games and China's human rights record the artist Badiucao created an NFT collection entitled \"Beijing 2022 Olympic\" which featured works mixing Olympic imagery with human rights messaging.\nA number of athletes have stated that they would boycott the Olympics opening ceremony.\nOn 4 February, a large protest against the games was held in Istanbul. Protesters included members of Turkey's Uyghur diaspora community. Hundreds of people in several countries protested against China's repression of its Uyghur minority and Tibetans.\nPropaganda and information operations issues.\nPropaganda and information operations.\nThe Chinese government's internet troll networks were mobilized before the Games to support government messaging. This has included campaigns of intimidation against human rights activists abroad. The Ministry of Public Security's Spamouflage disinformation network transitioned to primarily push Olympic messaging in December 2021.\nIn the run up to the Olympics, the Chinese government deployed dozens of fake Twitter accounts to push the Government's position in the Peng Shuai scandal and the IOC's involvement. The \"New York Times\" and \"ProPublica\" identified a network of more than 3,000 inauthentic-looking Twitter accounts that appeared to be coordinating. Such accounts appeared to operate solely to amplify state media, as most of these accounts were recently created with very few followers, and their activity consisted solely of reposting China comments including from one account called \"Spicy Panda\" whose cartoons and videos rallied against the Olympic boycott. A Twitter spokesperson said that hundreds of accounts included in the investigation's findings have since been suspended for violating the \"platform manipulation and spam policy,\" which prohibits \"coordinated activity that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts and automation.\"\nCensorship.\nDomestic Chinese criticism and debate on the potential environmental impacts caused by the Games are censored by the Chinese government on the press and internet. In recent years, censorship has been significantly stepped up. The government has banned, for example, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and, since 2019, Wikipedia.\nThe Citizen Lab report on the My2022 app (see below) discovered a \"censorship keywords\" list built into the app, and a feature that allows people to flag other \"politically sensitive\" expressions. The list of words included the names of Chinese leaders and government agencies, as well as references to the 1989 killing of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, and the religious group Falun Gong.\nNegative news censored during the games.\nOn 28 January 2022, a few days before the opening ceremony, the Xuzhou chained woman incident was exposed on Chinese social media. Several media figures, including Han Song from the state-controlled Xinhua News Agency argued that people should be more concerned about the incident than the Winter Olympics. However, to avoid any negative news that could divert the public's attention from the Olympics, Chinese news media outlets were order by authorities to avoid reporting such cases, with many social media posts related to the incident censored. Some people who tried to dig into the story by investigating the case in Feng County were even detained by the police.\nAlleged suspension of US athlete's Twitter account.\nUS athlete Aaron Blunck alleged that he was suspended by Twitter after he praised the 2022 Beijing Olympics. He reposted a fan's comment that read: \"Aaron Blunck [is] out here telling the truth and getting punished by his own government.\" He later also shared a commentator's tweet accusing the US government of causing his account to be shut down: \"Twitter has executed the order of the Western ruling cabals... Punishment comes pretty fast.\" In his Instagram post, he tagged Twitter and asked: \"What'd I do?\"\nHowever, it was revealed that the account had been suspended in September the previous year, over five months prior to the games. Twitter responded to the allegations saying that the account had been suspended in error and had since been recovered.\nEspionage directed at athletes.\nChina's espionage of athletes serves its political interests as well as addresses safety and COVID concerns. The smartphone app associated with the games, My2022, has been a particular subject of espionage concern.\nAll attendees to the Games, including athletes, audience members, and media, are required to use the My2022 app purportedly for daily Covid monitoring. The cybersecurity group Citizen Lab, a research institute at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, warned that the My2022 app fails to provide encryption on many of its files, and has security weaknesses that leave users exposed to data breaches. The Citizen Lab disclosed the concerns about the app on 3 December 2021, giving the organizing 15 days to respond and 45 days to fix the issues. A new iOS version of MY2022 was released on 6 January 2022, which failed to fix these problems, while adding a new \"Green Health Code\", feature that collects more medical data and also lacks SSL certificate validation making it vulnerable to attacks.\nNumerous Olympic committees, including the British Olympic Association, the Australian Olympic Committee, Canadian Olympic Committee, NOC*NSF, and United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee, have recommended that attendees use burner phones, virtual private networks (VPNs), and create email accounts for their time in China, while leaving personal smartphones and laptops at home.\nCyber security firm Internet 2.0 has also warned of potential security risks during the Olympics, when it examined the technology sponsors of the Games and their products that show \"the sophisticated and broad surveillance culture that exists in China\". Internet 2.0 noted that \"China's national data security laws are not designed with the Western values of privacy and liberty and do not offer the same level of protection\" as the laws allow the government to request access to the user data captured by these products.\nSjoerd den Daas incident.\nOn 4 February 2022, a Chinese security guard dragged Dutch journalist Sjoerd den Daas away from his camera during a live broadcast. This forced den Daas to interrupt his broadcast. He was not harmed and was able to resume his broadcast elsewhere a few minutes later. It was not immediately clear why Chinese officials decided to forcibly move den Daas in the middle of his broadcast.\nThe IOC described the guard as \"overzealous\". The IOC's spokesperson said \"These things do happen and I think it's a one-off. I hope it's a one-off and we will assure you that within the closed loop you will be able to carry on your work.\" Den Daas criticized the IOC for portraying what had happened as an \"isolated incident\". Yan Jiarong, spokeswoman for the Beijing Olympics, said \"we welcome all the international media\" and will protect their legal rights. According to his employer, the Dutch broadcaster NOS, the situation \"is increasingly becoming a daily reality for journalists in China\".\nOlympic torch relay.\nThe choice of Qi Fabao, a People's Liberation Army commander who had been seriously injured after participating in the 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes, as one of the torchbearers has been controversial in India. As a result, India joined the diplomatic boycott of the games.\nAmid human rights scrutiny, China chose a Uyghur athlete to help deliver the Olympic flame. For the final torch lighting, the Olympic flame was placed inside a giant snowflake in the \"Bird's Nest\" National Stadium by two athletes, Uyghur cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang from Xinjiang and Nordic combined competitor Zhao Jiawen.\nKamaltürk Yalqun, a torchbearer in the 2008 Olympics of Uyghur descent, supported a full boycott of the 2022 games and heavily criticized the Chinese government's treatment of his people.\nHanbok row.\nDuring the opening ceremony and the parade representing the 56 ethnic groups of China, one of the performers, reportedly representing Korean Chinese, wore a \"hanbok\". The display of the \"hanbok\" has drawn criticism and anger among some South Koreans and their politicians, who accused China of misappropriating the country's traditional clothing. Lee So-young, MP of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, said he regretted seeing the use of a \"hanbok\" during the ceremony. Presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung referred to it as cultural appropriation. The opposition People Power Party also called the move a \"rude act\" and urged the Moon Jae-in government to act tough on China. Hwang Hee, the South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, attended the ceremony while dressed in a \"hanbok\" himself.\nHowever, some South Koreans saw the \"hanbok\"-wearing woman as a representation of the estimated 2 million ethnic Koreans living in China and felt that the reactions were unnecessary. The Chinese Embassy in South Korea later responded that China respected the historical and cultural traditions of South Korea and that the \"hanbok\" belongs to ethnic Koreans everywhere, including those in China.\nAccidents.\nDuring training at the Yanqing National Sliding Centre in November 2021, Polish luger Mateusz Sochowicz encountered a closed gate despite being given a green light. He suffered a fractured knee cap and a cut to the leg bone. The track team \"didn't know what to do\", and Sochowicz spent half an hour on the ice before being transported to surgery. Had he not taken evasive action during the run, the incident could have ended in \"tragedy\". At the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili was killed during training after he lost control and was thrown into a support pole. Following Sochowicz's injury, the International Luge Federation announced additional safety measures such as setting up \"blockades at a start height\" and installing a screen where lanes merge \"to identify the exact position of the switch/barrier\".\nTaiwan athlete outfit row.\nIn early 2022, Huang Yu-Ting garnered much controversy after a video that she posted on 23 January, went viral of her wearing an outfit labeled \"China\" during practice, and she was later criticised heavily by Taiwanese netizens, especially those with pan-green political views, who had flooded her Facebook and Instagram account with hate comments. In response, Huang claimed on Instagram that the outfit was a gift from an athlete who was on the Chinese team, whom she befriended in Germany. She also posted a Taylor Swift music video, \"Shake It Off,\" which is famed for its lyrics, \"Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate,\" and she wrote alongside the video, \"My dear haters, this song is for you.\"\nHuang later removed the video post of her wearing the outfit, due to the social media backlash that came afterwards. According to a translation by the \"South China Morning Post\", Huang separately made a post on Facebook where she wrote, \"Thank you to everyone who cheered me up...I have removed the video due to too many unnecessary private messages!...\"Sport is sport and in the world of sports, we do not differentiate between nationalities. After the Games, we all are good friends.\"\nHo Chih-wei, a Legislative Yuan member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) criticised Huang Yu-Ting, calling her \"brainless\" and demanding that she \"shut up\", as well as supporting a law that would punish athletes such as Huang with bans from sport events. Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang from the ruling DPP called for an investigation and punishment for Huang.\nNational identity is a highly sensitive issue in Taiwan. After the communist forces won the Chinese Civil War, the mainland was not represented at the Olympics, and the only Chinese team competing came from Taiwan. After most nations and the UN switched their recognition to Beijing, however, Taiwan has been competing as Chinese Taipei.\nParticipation of women.\nNordic combined remained the only Winter discipline that women could not compete in, with World Cup champion Tara Geraghty-Moats quoted as saying, \"The IOC (International Olympic Committee) lets transgendered people into the Olympics in all sports, but not women into all sports.\" The International Ski Federation has said that it has been developing women's Nordic combined and intends for it to be added to the Olympic programme in the future. A previous request was rejected in 2018. According to the IOC, female quota positions for the 2022 Winter Games increased from 41 per cent to 45.44 per cent.\nSporting controversies.\nBy the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total five athletes were reported for doping violations.\nMixed team ski jumping normal hill event.\nDuring the mixed team normal hill event of ski jumping, the previous Olympic medalists, Daniela Iraschko-Stolz of Austria, Katharina Althaus of Germany, and Sara Takanashi of Japan, as well as the former world championship medalists Anna Odine Stroem and Silje Opseth of Norway were all disqualified prior to the start due to the concern that their jumpsuits were not tight enough. According to the officials at the event, jumpsuits had to fit tight enough to not yield the advantage over air, which was part of the newly updated International Ski Federation (FIS) regulations. The Japanese, Austrian, Norwegian, and German teams all suffered the heavy impact as their disqualified athletes automatically received 0 point for failing to make an attempt, which placed the four teams in fourth, fifth, eight, and ninth place respectively, while the Russian and Canadian teams capitalized on that and won silver and bronze medals respectively.\nAfter the game, Althaus expressed her dissatisfaction with the disqualification, emphasizing that she wore the same jumpsuit which was approved for the individual normal hill event that took place two days before. Clas Brede Bråthen, the former ski jumper and manager of the Norwegian team who had the two team members disqualified, also raised the complaint, claiming the event as one of the sport's darker days. Bråthen added that \"this is something we should have cleaned up in before the Olympics\". After her disqualification, Opseth also said \"I am just shocked. I do not understand anything about what happened today\". Takanashi deeply apologized for her suit violation as the Japanese team could have been in the medal zone if it was not for her disqualification. After the controversy, Aga Baczkowska from FIS told the Norway's media NRK that the inspections at the event followed the new regulation. Baczkowska stated that it was the responsibility of the participating athletes to ensure that their jumpsuits were in compliance.\nMixed team 2000 metre short-track speed-skating event.\nIn the semi-final heat of the 2000 metre mixed team relay in short-track speed-skating, the United States was disqualified after narrowly finishing in the second place behind Hungary. This allowed the Chinese team, who came in third, to claim the second place and advance to the finals to eventually win the gold medal. According to the officials at the event, the team was disqualified for causing the \"interference inside the track with skaters coming in to take an exchange\" upon the replay review. Ryan Pivirotto, the skater who was identified as the cause of the penalty, stated \"The call came to me, on what I did. I don't even know really what I did, because there was no contact\". Maame Biney, who was representing the United States in the Olympics but did not participate in the relay, found the decision to be an \"interesting call\". Andrew Heo, another member of the relay team, said \"Obviously things didn't work out, but I think we believe that we belonged there. And I think we could've done really well in the final\".\nMen's 1000 metre short-track speedskating event.\nDuring the Heat 1 of the semi-finals in the men's 1000 metres short track speedskating event, Hwang Dae-heon of South Korea was disqualified after finishing first, which was followed in the Heat 2 by his countryman Lee June-seo being disqualified for a lane change that caused contact. As a result of their disqualifications, Li Wenlong and Wu Dajing of China advanced to the Final A race. In the Final A race, Shaolin Sándor Liu from Hungary was disqualified after crossing the finish line first, ultimately resulting in Ren Ziwei and Li Wenlong of China who finished after Liu to be awarded with the gold and silver medal, respectively. After the event, both the South Korean and the Hungarian team filed protests to the International Skating Union.\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) received and rejected the two protests from Hungary and South Korea on February 7, 2022. The ISU stated that the decisions in regards to any disqualification for rule violations cannot be challenged, adding that their Chief Referee had reviewed the incident with the Video Referee and stood by the final decisions. According to the ISU, Hwang Dae-heon was disqualified for the \"illegal late pass causing contact\" while the disqualification of Shaolin Sándor Liu was due to a \"straight lane change from inside to out causing contact\" and an \"arm block at the finish\". The Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee later filed an official appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nWomen's 500 metre short-track speed-skating event.\nAfter the close-up video of the incident surfaced on Reddit, some viewers of the quarter-finals in the women's 500 metres short track speedskating event noticed and accused the Chinese skater Fan Kexin of reaching over the leg of another competitor to flick a track marker at the Canadian skater Alyson Charles, which seemingly caused Charles to trip and crash along with Fan during the race. While no call was made on the incident, Charles was advanced to the semi-finals after it was assessed that she was impeded by another Canadian skater Florence Brunelle who got disqualified. Fan, who came in third after the crash, failed to advance.\nMen's 5000 metres relay short-track speed skating event.\nDuring the 5000 metres relay event, also in short track speed skating, in the semifinals of the event, the Chinese team fell with 10 laps to go. This happened at a point in the race where Pascal Dion (from Canada) and a Chinese skater had their skates come into contact. The team was advanced to the A final, with no team disqualified during the race. The Chinese team were advanced, even though they finished last in the race and there was no impeding action on the team.\nMen's snowboard slopestyle.\nIn the men's snowboard slopestyle, Canada's Max Parrot had won the gold medal and China's Su Yiming won the silver. However the medal results stirred controversy on social media when BBC commentator Ed Leigh believed the gold medal should have been awarded to Su, and pointed out that Parrot, during his frontside 1440 in his second run, had actually committed a 'cardinal sin' by grabbing his knee instead of the board, and should have been deducted for it, but the judges had apparently failed to spot it. Replays showed him \"failing to grab his board and instead clutching around his lower leg, meaning that the maneuver was incomplete and should have been marked down. Leigh wrote in the BBC, \"The judges have put execution at such a premium that something like that should have cost him two or three points. So the gold has gone wrong there. ... I think Su Yiming actually took the gold there. This is a mistake on the judges' part.\"\nMoreover, bronze medalist Mark McMorris felt he had the best run of the day, and should have been the gold medalist, \"but knowing that I kind of had the run of the day and one of the best rounds of my life and the whole industry knows what happened\". Parrot, acknowledged the error and still felt like he deserved the gold medal, \"But in the end, it's a judged sport and the fact is I had the most technical run of the day on pretty much every feature\". Lead judge for the event, Iztok Sumatic said, \"there are so many factors. All I can say, in Max's defence, regarding this specific run, is that it was still an insane run. He killed it, especially on the rails.\" Ultimately the blame lay with the organizers, who failed to provide multiple angles of the event. Parrot reviewed the runs by the three medalists and, \"he spotted three \"little mistakes\" during McMorris' turn, and also noted a few errors by Su\", while Parrot, \"didn't have any mistakes on five of the six features, and on the one jump, I had a bigger mistake\".\nMen's snowboard halfpipe.\nPublic outrage was sparked by the controversially low judgment of Japanese snowboarder Ayumu Hirano's second run scoring which had made commentators and fans cry \"foul\" on the judges. Hirano then had to repeat the exceptional performance in his third run, and successfully landing the very \"dangerous\" triple cork again, this time under greater public scrutiny of the judges, and moving from second place to winning the gold medal.\nMen's speed skating 500 metres.\nIn the men's 500 metres speed skating event, a false start was called in the last two heats, one of which included current World Cup champion Laurent Dubreuil. This was questioned by 1992 Winter Olympics Champion Bart Veldkamp, who called it \"very suspicious\". According to Yetta Claytone of the Taylor Daily Press, due to the false start, Dubreuil had to be more cautious on his start, and his reaction time was slower than the initial start. According to Sportnieuws.nl, a false start would have disrupted the athletes' concentration, and also used up energy. However, Dubreuil believed the false start shouldn't be used as an excuse as it was, \"something that's totally possible to overcome and that it shouldn't make a difference\".\nFigure skating.\nThe medal ceremony for the figure skating team event, originally scheduled for Tuesday, 8 February, was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required \"legal consultation\" with the International Skating Union. Several media outlets reported on Wednesday that the issue was over a positive test, held in December 2021, for trimetazidine by the ROC's Kamila Valieva, which was officially confirmed on February 11. The results are pending investigation. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), previously under suspension from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2015 for its years of serving solely to hide the positive doping results of Russian athletes (re-instated in September 2018), cleared Valieva on February 9, a day after the December test results were released, two months after the test. The IOC, WADA, and International Skating Union (ISU) are appealing RUSADA's decision.\nOn February 14, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that Valieva should be allowed to compete in the women's single event, deciding that preventing her from competing \"would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances\", though her gold medal in the team event was still under consideration. The favorable decision from the court was made in part due to her age, as minor athletes are subject to different rules than adult athletes. The IOC announced that the medal ceremony would not take place until the investigation is over and there is a concrete decision whether to strip Russia of their medals.\nBy 9 March 2022, Travis Tygart of the USADA reported that Valieva had not requested that her \"B\" sample be tested, apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance TMZ belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements. Tygart further stated that as a minor Valieva could still be either fully exculpated or given a warning concerning her testing positive depending on the extent of findings in the on-going RUSADA investigation of doping. According to Tygart, an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a two-year suspension, which is half of the suspension time which could be assessed for adults.\nOn 29 January 2024, the CAS disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation. On 30 January 2024 the ISU reallocated medals to upgrade the United States to gold and Japan to silver while downgrading ROC to bronze, but this decision has not yet been ratified by the IOC. Although Valieva would technically be made eligible for participation in the 2026 Winter Olympics following her four year suspension, the previous full-scale invasion by Russia of Ukraine in 2022 resulted in further sporting sanctions against Russia which remain in full effect as of February 2024, which would prevent her from participating in the 2026 Winter Olympics unless lifted sufficiently early.\nMen's Mass Start.\nThe U.S. speedskater Joey Mantia alleged that the South Korean speedskater Lee Seung-hoon made contact by pulling his arm back, costing him the bronze medal during the Mass Start final. Mantia lost by a 0.002-second margin. According to Mantia, he felt contact and told his coach \"He got me\" after the race. Mantia recalled \"Coming up on him, I thought my blade was in front of his, and then he put his back in front of mine. I don't know if there was contact ... it felt like maybe a little bit, maybe not on purpose, but it happens.\" When asked if he made the contact with Mantia, Lee said he could not remember since he was flustered during the final moment at the finish line. Mantia and his coaches watched the replay several times, and protested that he had been pulled back at the finish line. However, the team did not expect any changes to the result because the Mass Final is a new event with minimal precedent for rules. The United States team lodged a challenge, but Lee was awarded with the bronze medal."

The name of the dish in Chinese, \"Mayishangshu\", has been translated as \"ants climbing a tree\", \"ants on the tree\", \"ants creeping up a tree\", \"ants climbing a hill\" or \"ants climbing a log\". It is so called because the dish has bits of ground meat clinging to noodles, evoking an image of ants walking on twigs. The dish consists of ground meat, such as pork, cooked in a sauce and poured over bean thread noodles. \nOther ingredients in the dish may include rice vinegar, soy sauce, vegetable oil, sesame oil, scallions, garlic, ginger, and chili paste.\nTo make the \"ants\", meat is marinated for a short time at room temperature while the noodles are soaked to soften. In a wok, oil is heated until almost smoking. The scallions, garlic, and ginger are cooked slightly in the wok before the marinated meat is added. The softened noodles are added to the wok to soak up the flavor and juices.\nDry noodles that have not yet been softened can also be fried in hot oil to add texture to the dish. The noodles will puff immediately and can be removed with a bamboo or stainless wire skimmer, then set on paper towels to drain before adding to the rest of the dish."

        "text": "The 4×100 metres relay at the World Championships in Athletics has been contested by both men and women since the inaugural edition in 1983. It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 4×100 metres relay at the Olympics. The competition format typically has one qualifying round leading to a final between eight teams. As of 2015, nations can qualify for the competition through a top eight finish at the previous IAAF World Relays event, with the remaining teams coming through the more traditional route of ranking highly on time in the seasonal lists. This system was modified due to the postponement of 2023 World Athletics Relays to 2024: therefore, the eight teams directly qualified are those of the \n2022 World Championships, in Eugene, completed by eight more 2022-2023 top lists' teams.\nThe championship records for the event are 37.04 seconds for men, set by Jamaica in 2011, and 41.03 seconds for women, set by the United States in 2023. The men's world record has been broken or equalled at the competition on four occasions. The women's world record has never been broken or equalled at the competition.\nThe United States is the most successful nation in the discipline, with nine men's gold medals and nine women's gold medals. The next most successful nation is Jamaica, which has won four gold medals for men's and five for the women's events. Jamaica won in 1991, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2019. The USA has won the most overall medals at 26 with Jamaica having the second most at 24. Canada, with three golds, and France, with two, are the only other nations to have won multiple titles. Great Britain has the third highest overall medal tally in the event with 15 medals.\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is the most successful athlete of the event, with four gold medals and four silver medals. Her compatriot Usain Bolt is the next most successful, with four consecutive gold medals from 2009 to 2015 and a silver medal in 2007. Kerron Stewart and Nesta Carter of Jamaica and Carl Lewis of the USA are the only other athletes to have won three gold medals in the relay event.\nThe United States has twice been stripped of the gold medal due to doping by athletes on the national team, having lost both men's and women's titles in 2001.\nDoping.\nThe men's event was affected by doping in its debut tournament in 1983, with Ben Johnson running for Canada, although the team did not progress beyond the first round. Johnson's drug use was only self-admitted during this period and he did not fail a drug test that year. Johnson ran for the fourth-placed Canada team at the 1987 event. His Canadian team mate Angella Issajenko later became the first female relay athlete to be sanctioned – she helped Canada to fifth at the same edition.\nThe positive drug test for Nigeria's Innocent Asonze in 1999 marked the first instance where a medal-winning team was disqualified at the World Championships in Athletics. Brazil was elevated to the bronze medal as a result. Doping persisted two years later, as France's Christophe Cheval was disqualified after a positive test for nandrolone shortly before the event (the team were semi-finalists only). The greatest disqualifications yet followed after the BALCO scandal in 2005. Tim Montgomery of the 2001-winning men's team was later disqualified following his admission of doping during the period, meaning that the American gold medallists were stricken from the record (South Africa were elevated as champions). Similarly, Marion Jones's and Kelli White's admitted usage led to the disqualification of the winning American women's team (Germany were made champions as a result).\nThe impact of the BALCO scandal extended to the 2003 edition, as medals were again reassigned as a result of British athlete Dwain Chambers doping. Brazil were elevated to silver and the Netherlands became the bronze medallists. The next doping disqualification to occur in the relay was in 2009, when Nigerian women's runner Toyin Augustus had her team's first round result annulled. A similar fate met Lim Hee-Nam and the South Korean men in 2011. The fourth-placed Trinidad and Tobago team had their result retrospectively disqualified due to Semoy Hackett's failed doping test prior to the competition. A third straight championships was affected as a result of Ukraine's Yelyzaveta Bryzhina failing a doping test for drostanolone (as of 2015 the Ukrainian relay team's first round result still stands, however)."

He is a very mobile big with a good post skillset.\"\nFootball.\nCurtis had experience playing American football at the semi-professional level. In 2012, he decided to return to the sport, which he had not played since high school. He signed with the North County Cobras of the LaBelle Community Football League (LCFL) as a wide receiver and tight end. The Cobras are based in Vista, California. In his first game, Curtis recorded a touchdown reception against the San Diego Riptide. He said, \"I've been feeling football. Football's my first sport, and over the years going through high school my mom didn't want me to play football because of the dangers.\" He was coached by Tony Vinson, who praised him for his determination.\nDeath.\nCurtis was shot and killed outside of a Home Depot in Victorville, California, on May 27, 2017. A person was arrested on Wednesday, May 31 for the shooting."

        "text": "The qualifying Round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic was held from February 11 to September 25, 2016. Teams which participated at the 2013 World Baseball Classic were automatically qualified for the 2017 tournament except the four nations which ended up last in their respective groups: Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Spain had to play in the qualifiers along with 12 other national teams. 16 teams participated, divided into four groups of four teams each. The winners of each of the four groups qualified for the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\nThe qualifiers were organized as four independent modified double-elimination tournaments featuring four teams each. The final game was winner-take-all, even if won by the team emerging from the loser's bracket. That is, the team emerging from the winner's bracket might be eliminated despite losing only one game.\nAustralia, Mexico, Colombia, and Israel won their qualifiers and participated in the 2017 tournament. In their respective brackets, both Australia and Mexico were top seed (signified by home-field advantage) as well as the team that had competed in the 2013 tournament. However, Colombia defeated top seed Panama as well as 2013 participant Spain to advance, while top seed Israel defeated 2013 participant Brazil.\nPlayers.\nMinor league players.\nQualifier 1 featured 16 players who were affiliated with Major League clubs. Nine MLB-affiliated players were on the Australia roster, three on the South Africa roster, two on the New Zealand roster, and two on the Philippines roster.\nQualifier 2 featured 34 players who were affiliated with Major League clubs. Sixteen MLB-affiliated players were on the Mexico roster (representing 57% of the Mexico roster), eleven on the Nicaragua roster, six on the Germany roster, and one on the Czech Republic roster.\nQualifier 3 featured 31 players who were affiliated with Major League clubs. Sixteen MLB-affiliated players were on the Colombia roster (representing 57% of the Colombia roster), ten on the Panama roster, four on the Spain roster, and one on the France roster.\nQualifier 4 featured 41 players who were affiliated with Major League clubs. Twenty MLB-affiliated players were on the Israel roster and four more Israel players were recent Major Leaguers (together representing 86% of the Israel roster), twelve MLB-affiliated players were on the Great Britain roster, nine on the Brazil roster, and none on the Pakistan roster.\nExperienced Major League players.\nOnly a few experienced Major Leaguers participated in the spring qualifiers. These included relief pitcher Peter Moylan of Australia, first baseman Adrián González and pitcher Óliver Pérez, both of Mexico, and catcher Carlos Ruiz of Panama.\nQualifier 4 took place in September, after the end of the minor league season but during the Major League season, and thus no active Major League players participated. Although Brazil had a few young Major League players, Israel was the team most likely to be adversely affected by this circumstance. In 2013, Israel also was placed in a qualifier that took place during the Major League season and thus was unable to include a number of Major League players of Jewish descent who had expressed interest in playing for Israel. Without these players, Israel narrowly lost its 2013 qualifier to Spain.\nIsrael's roster included eight former Major Leaguers: catcher Ryan Lavarnway, infielders Ike Davis, Cody Decker, Nate Freiman and Josh Satin, and pitchers Josh Zeid, Jason Marquis and Craig Breslow. On the other hand, infielder Ty Kelly, one of Israel's twenty minor leaguers, had to withdraw from the qualifier after he was called up to the New York Mets.\nVenues.\nFour stadiums were used during the qualifying round:\nPools composition.\nPakistan was the only team in the 2017 qualifiers participating in the World Baseball Classic for the first time. It replaced Thailand, which participated in the 2013 qualifiers.\nQualifying round.\nQualifier 1.\nAustralia won all three of its games to advance. South Africa defeated New Zealand in the opening round and again in the losers' bracket to reach the final game, but lost to Australia 12–5.\nQualifier 2.\nMexico won all three of its games to advance. Nicaragua defeated both of the other two teams but lost by wide margins in both of its games against Mexico. The Czech Republic performed surprisingly well, giving close games to both Mexico and Nicaragua and defeating Germany by a wide margin.\nQualifier 3.\nIn the opening round, hosts Panama defeated France while 2013 participant Spain fell to Colombia. France then eliminated Spain while Colombia defeated Panama. Panama eliminated France to gain a rematch against Colombia, which won the final game 2–1.\nQualifier 4.\nIn the opening round, Israel defeated Great Britain while 2013 participant Brazil defeated Pakistan. Great Britain then eliminated Pakistan while Israel defeated Brazil. Great Britain eliminated Brazil to gain a rematch against Israel, which won the final game 9–1.\nAttendance.\n111,795 (avg. 4,658; pct. 33.0%)\nAdditional rules.\nA pitcher threw no more than 85 pitches per game in the Qualifying Round unless the pitcher needed more to complete a batter's plate appearance.\nA pitcher must:\nA mercy rule came into effect when one team led by either fifteen runs after five innings, or ten runs after seven innings.\nAn alternative version of the IBAF's extra inning rule was also used. If after 10 innings the score is still tied, each half inning thereafter starts with runners on second and first base. The runners are the eighth and ninth hitters due in that inning respectively. For example, if the number five hitter is due to lead off the inning, the number three hitter is on second base, and the number four hitter on first base. For the first time in the World Baseball Classic, this rule was actually employed in this year's qualifiers, as the Qualifier 2 game between Nicaragua and the Czech Republic went into the 11th inning. Nicaragua scored three runs in the top of the inning, the Czech Republic only two in the bottom, so Nicaragua went on to the final game of the bracket."

        "text": "Allen Lamont Smith (born October 19, 1975) is an American former college basketball coach, who was most recently an assistant coach at the University of Texas at El Paso for the UTEP Miners men's basketball team. He was previously the head coach at his alma mater University of San Diego, which he left in March 2018. Smith resigned from UTEP in March 2019 after the University of San Diego revealed that Smith was accused of accepting a bribe in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal.\nEarly life.\nBorn and raised in The Colony, Texas, Smith played for the San Diego Toreros from 1995 to 1999. He earned team defensive player of the year honors in 1997 and 1999. Smith graduated from the University of San Diego in 1998 with a bachelor's degree in communications.\nCoaching career.\nSmith began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Saint Louis. He was an assistant coach at Saint Mary's from 2001 to 2007, when he took an assistant gig at Santa Clara University. Smith was at Santa Clara for one season, and he left to fill an assistant position at Arizona State. At Arizona State, he helped develop James Harden and the Sun Devils experienced two 20-win seasons in his four years with the team. Smith became an assistant coach at the University of Washington in 2012 and spent one season on the bench with the Huskies. From 2013 to 2015 Smith served as an assistant coach at the University of New Mexico.\nOn April 1, 2015, Smith was hired as head coach of the San Diego Toreros. He takes over for the fired Bill Grier. \"We're irrelevant right now in terms of basketball in this city,\" said Smith. San Diego went 9–21 in his first season of 2015–16 and improved to 13–18 in 2016–17. As of the last game he coached on February 24, 2018, San Diego was 18–12 (9–9 WCC), the most successful record during his tenure.\nLegal issues.\nSan Diego placed Smith on administrative leave on February 26, 2018, a day after Smith was arrested at the Oakland International Airport on charges of domestic violence, assault with force likely to commit great bodily injury, and false imprisonment. The arrest was shortly before the team's flight back to San Diego following a win over San Francisco on February 24. Smith was released from jail on a reported $115,000 bail.\nOn March 7, 2018, Smith resigned after three seasons as San Diego's head coach, just hours after the domestic violence charges against him were dropped. A month later, on April 11, he was hired by Rodney Terry to be an assistant coach for the UTEP Miners men's basketball team.\nSmith resigned from UTEP on March 20, 2019, after the University of San Diego revealed that Smith was accused of accepting a bribe in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal for allegedly illegally helping a Beverly Hills real estate developer's children gain admission to the university. On November 13, 2020, Martin Fox was sentenced to three months in prison, three months of home confinement, 250 hours of community service, forfeiture of $245,000 and an additional fine of $95,000 after pleading guilty to bribing Smith. In March 2022, it was reported that of all of the coaches implicated in the 2019 college admissions scandal, which included Smith, Jovan Vavic was the only one of these coaches to challenge the charges brought against them in court, and, unlike Smith, the only coach to remain a defendant in the case as well. Unlike Martin Fox and other plaintiffs, Department of Justice does not list Smith as among those who were charged during the admission scandal's investigation."

        "text": "George Albert Williams (1856 – 27 April 1925), also known as Bully Williams, was a New Zealand rugby union player who toured with the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team to the British Isles and Australia. Williams was one of five non-Māori players in the Natives' side.\nWilliams was born in Auckland in 1856, and did not start playing rugby until the age of 24. He was a member of the Wellington club Poneke, and was selected for Wellington province from the club in 1886, 1887 and 1888.\nIn early 1888, Joe Warbrick, a member of the 1884 New Zealand team that toured Australia, started planning for a squad of Māori rugby players to tour the British Isles. As Warbrick was scouting for players throughout 1888, his plans changed, and he decided to include a number of Pākehā (European non-Māori) in the side. Eventually five Pākehā were included in the squad of twenty-six, and the side was consequently named the New Zealand Native football team.\nAt 32, Williams was the oldest player in the team, and only joined a day before their first match. The tour became the longest in rugby history; 107 matches were played during the 14-month tour, which had legs in Australia, the British Isles, and New Zealand. Of these 107 matches, 74 were in the British Isles, and an average of a game every 2.3 days on that leg. Williams played in 53 of these, scoring 12 tries in the process, and captained the team on a number of occasions. In total, Williams played at least 75 matches on tour (a number of team lists are missing).\nWilliams played in all three of the Natives' \"international\" matches while on tour; a victory over Ireland, a narrow loss to Wales, and a controversial loss to England.\nWilliams retired as a player after the tour, but continued to be involved in the game as a referee. Along with two other players, he contributed to tour manager Thomas Eyton's \"Rugby Football Past and Present\", published in 1896, that gave an account of the tour. He contributed a number of article to the \"New Zealand Truth\" before the departure of the 1924 All Blacks. Outside of rugby, Williams was a police officer, and was involved in the arrest of the Maori spiritual leader Te Whiti o Rongomai. He served throughout New Zealand, including in Wellington, Hastings, Invercargill and Marlborough.\nWilliams' native team cap, donated by his grandson Rob Williams, is held in the collection of the New Zealand Rugby Museum."

He served as Mayor of Timaru between 1901 and 1902.\nEarly life and family.\nBorn in Timaru in 1869, Macintosh was educated at Timaru Boys' High School. On 28 May 1890 he married Lydia Beatrice Thompson in Timaru. Their children included the anaesthetist Robert Macintosh, who was born in 1897.\nRugby union.\nA forward, Macintosh represented at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, on their 1893 tour of Australia. On that tour he played in four matches, including wins over New South Wales and Queensland.\nPolitical career.\nMacintosh was first elected as a member of the Timaru Borough Council in 1896. In 1898 he was also elected to the Timaru Harbour Board. Despite the local newspaper, \"The Timaru Herald\", not supporting him, he was elected Mayor of Timaru in 1901, and served a one-year term, after which he stood down.\nLater life.\nOn 29 April 1903 Macintosh left Timaru, saying that he was visiting a farm near Temuka. Instead, he travelled by train to Lyttelton and then ship to Wellington, from where he sailed for South America. A warrant for his arrest was issued on 4 May, relating to a charge of fraud in a property transaction, and on 22 June 1903 he was declared bankrupt.\nMacintosh settled and worked in commerce in Buenos Aires. He died while on business in Rio de Janeiro in 1918. In 1940 his son, John Nicholson Macintosh, was appointed British vice-consul in Santa Fe, Argentina."

She also played in the WNBA in 1997 for the Phoenix Mercury and in 2000 for the Portland Fire.\nAuburn statistics.\nSource\nWNBA.\nAlthough not part of the initial player allocation, elite draft or college draft, Williams was fortunately able to sign a contract with Phoenix Mercury on May 22, 1997 for the WNBA's inaugural season in 1997. Her debut game was played on June 22, 1997 in a 76 - 59 win over the Charlotte Sting where she recorded 9 points and 4 rebounds. Williams would only play in 12 of the Mercury's 28 regular season games (mostly missing the month of July where she played in 1 out of 12 games). The Mercury finished 1st in the western conference with a 16 - 12 record and made it to the playoffs where they would be defeated by the New York Liberty 41 - 59 in the semi-finals. Williams had a playing time of only 52 seconds, and this game would end up being Williams only playoff game in her career.\nWilliams would be moved from the Mercury to the Detroit Shock on February 18, 1998 as part of the expansion drive for newly-formed teams. Unfortunately, she would never play for the Shock and missed the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Looking for a comeback, Williams would sign with the Sacramento Monarchs for the 2000 season. But two weeks before the Monarchs' was set to have their season opener, Williams was waived by the team on May 15, 2000.\nThe newly formed Portland Fire would be the next stop for Williams. After missing two back-to-back seasons, the team picked up her contract and she played her first game for the team on June 3, 2000 recording 10 points, 2 rebounds and 1 steal. Williams played in many more games for the Fire than she did her rookie year with the Mercury, appearing in 26 of the Fire's 32 games. The Fire finished with a 10 - 22 record and missed the playoffs. \nWilliams would be waived by the Fire on April 17, 2001 (three days before the 2001 Draft) and did not play in the WNBA again. The final game of her career was the Fire's final regular season game that season. The game coincidentally took place against William's former team (Mercury) on August 9, 2000 and the Fire would lose the game 60 - 68 with Williams scoring 7 points.\nFor her career, Williams played in 38 games and averaged 3.1 points, 0.7 rebounds and 0.4 assists."

        "text": "Edinburgh Academical Cricket Club, generally known as Edinburgh Accies, is a cricket club founded in 1855 and based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The club is the oldest Old Boys cricket club in Scotland.\nIn 1854, the Edinburgh Academy acquired a playing field at Raeburn Place, Stockbridge, and Edinburgh Accies was founded the following year. Former pupils of the Edinburgh Academy and members of EACC were integral in the development of Scottish cricket, and within a few years all the private schools in Scotland had private cricket grounds.\nThe club's distinguished history includes 42 Academicals who have played representative cricket, 6 have played both rugby and cricket for Scotland, and a few have played for the MCC. The club won the Scottish Cup in 1974, and Masterton Trophy in 1970 and 1977.\nEdinburgh Accies, originally an exclusive club for alumni of the Edinburgh Academy, has signed professionals since 1981, and membership today is open for anyone to join.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe origin of Edinburgh Accies can be traced back to before the club was officially formed to the establishment of the Edinburgh Academy in 1824. Cricket was played at the academy almost as soon as it was open in the \"Yards\" which surround the main school building. T.H. Shepherd's drawing of \"The New Academy\" (1828), shows two boys holding cricket bats. One of the boys in the drawing was William Moncreiff, who joined the school on its opening day and was one of the founders of The Grange Cricket Club in 1832.\nFirst 50 years (1855 - 1904).\nThe first cricket match, for which any scores have been traced, appeared in The Courant of 17 April 1855. Academy cricket flourished through the 1860s with the 1866 XI winning all its school matches. \nThe 1860s and 1870s produced a number of notable cricketers and also a distinguished cricket writer in Andrew Lang (Captain of the Academy 2nd XI in 1861). T.R. Marshall went on to play for the MCC and Scotland. He and two other Academicals, R.H. Johnston and H.J. Stevenson were in the Scottish XI which defeated a strong Gloucestershire XI (including W. G. Grace) in 1891. \nL. M. Balfour-Melville who was captain of the Academy XI in 1871, ranks with T.R. Marshall as the best Academical batsman before 1900. He captained the Scotland XI which defeated the Australians in 1872 at the age of 18. \nH.J. Stevenson was one of the great lob bowlers, and his notes were included in an MCC booklet \"Instructions to Cricket Coaches at Lord's\". In 1886 for the academy he took five wickets in five balls and repeated this feat for The Academicals in a club match in 1894. On one occasion he took all ten wickets in a match against Perthshire Cricket Club.\nFirst half of 20th century (1905 - 1953).\nAfter the turn of the century, the fixture list became stabilised, with H. J. Stevenson in command the club built a reputation for attractive and effective cricket. Academical cricket ceased during World War I, resuming in 1919. \nThe 1930s saw a peak for the club with a strong 1st XI including eight of its playing members who had represented Scotland, and two other competitive teams. Academical cricket at Raeburn Place was once again interrupted during the Second World War, with the playing field ploughed up for agricultural use, with the Academicals not returning until 18 June 1949.\nAdvent of competitive cricket (1953 - 1969).\nThe East of Scotland District League was formed in 1953, with the Academicals first winning the league in 1957. \nThe Centenary of the Field was celebrated in 1954 with a cricket week, including a two-day match between the Academicals and the MCC and a Centenary Dinner at which the Toast of 'The Field' was proposed by Alec Douglas-Home. \nThe 1960s with J. M. Allan as captain led the club to its first ever international tour to Ireland in 1963, with the venture repeated the following year, and an overseas tour to Canada in 1969.\nPaths of glory (1970s).\nThe 1970s saw the club's most successful decade for silverware. In 1970, the Masterton Trophy was won for the first time, and again in 1977. The Academicals won the Scottish section of the National Club Knock Out Competition on four occasions, in 1971 reaching the last 8 before losing to Scarborough who went on to win that year. In 1974 the Club won the Scottish Cup for the first time. The league structure was reformed in 1975 into 3 main divisions, with the club going open the following year allowing non-former pupils of the Edinburgh Academy to join. In 1979 as part of the 125th anniversary celebrations, the club undertook a tour to the North American continent with games from Vancouver to California.\nProfessional era (1980s &amp; 1990s).\nIn 1981 George Reifer who represented Barbados and later Scotland, became the club's first professional. Other notable professionals during this period include Nehemiah Perry who played four Tests and 21 One Day Internationals for the West Indies and Peter Steindl who played for Scotland.\nRecent times.\nDue to current redevelopment at Raeburn Place, the club has spent its longest period away from their home ground since the Second World War, and currently plays at its second ground New Field, which it shares with the Edinburgh Academy school.\nBadge, colours and name.\nThe monogram of the Academical Cricket Club (ACC) symbolise the cricket activities of both the Academy and the Academicals, as the club was originally intended for both boys and Old Boys. It was not thought necessary to include Edinburgh in the title. The monogram is still used on 1st Academical XI caps, and badges. \nIn the 1860s cricket shirts were brightened up by coloured shirts, with the Academy XI wearing white shirts with narrow blue stripes. In 1871 the academy striped shirt was discarded, and a white shirt with a blue and white sash was approved instead.\nGrounds.\nRaeburn Place.\nThe Academical Field at Raeburn Place was purchased by the Edinburgh Academy in 1854, and has several unique claims to fame - the first school playing field (of its kind) in Scotland, the oldest private cricket ground in Edinburgh and one of the oldest in Scotland, the \"cradle of Rugby Football\" in Scotland, being the scene of the first International Football Match and Scotland's 'home ground' for 24 years. \nThe Academical Field at Raeburn Place is home to both the EACC - the oldest Old Boys' Cricket Club in Scotland, and the EAFC - one of the oldest Football Clubs in the world.\nNew Field.\nNine acres to the north of Inverleith Place was acquired by the Edinburgh Academy in 1895 which became the academy's \"New Field\". The Academical club has often played matches there as a second ground, notably in recent years while the Raeburn Place ground is being redeveloped.\nNotable players.\nThe following Academicals have played Representative Cricket.\nSince 1955.\nA number of Edinburgh Academicals have represented Scotland at both rugby and cricket, these include: Henry Stevenson, T. R. Marshall, L.M. Balfour, E.M. Bannerman, W.E. Maclagan and K.W. Marshall"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career batting average leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, the batting average (BA) is defined by the number of hits divided by at bats. It is usually reported to three decimal places and pronounced as if it were multiplied by 1,000: a player with a batting average of .300 is \"batting three-hundred.\" A point (or percentage point) is understood to be .001. If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken to more than three decimal places.\nOutfielder Ty Cobb, whose career ended in 1928, has the highest batting average in Major League Baseball (MLB) history. He batted .366 over 24 seasons, mostly with the Detroit Tigers. In addition, he won a record 11 batting titles for leading the American League in BA over the course of an entire season. He batted over .360 in 11 consecutive seasons from 1909 to 1919. Oscar Charleston is second all-time with a career batting average of .364. He had the highest career batting average in the history of the combined Negro leagues from 1920 to 1948. Rogers Hornsby has the third highest BA of all-time, at .358. He won seven batting titles in the National League (NL) and has the highest NL average in a single season since 1900, when he batted .424 in 1924. He batted over .370 in six consecutive seasons.\nOther notable players include: Shoeless Joe Jackson batted .356 over 13 seasons before he was permanently suspended from organized baseball in 1921 for his role in the Black Sox Scandal. Jud Wilson played professionally from 1922 to 1945 and twice played on Negro World Series championship teams. Lefty O'Doul first came to the major leagues as a pitcher, but after developing a sore arm, he converted to an outfielder and won two batting titles. Turkey Stearnes twice led the Negro National League in batting average. Ed Delahanty's career was cut short when he fell into the Niagara Falls and died during the 1903 season. Ted Williams remains the most recent player to bat .400 in a major-league season. Babe Ruth hit for a career .342 average and held the major-league record for career home runs from 1921 until 1974.\nA player must have a minimum of 3,000 plate appearances to qualify for the list.\nList.\nDifferent sources of baseball records present somewhat differing lists of career batting average leaders. There is consensus that Ty Cobb leads this category. Further rankings vary by source, primarily due to differences in minimums needed to qualify (number of games played or plate appearances), or differences in early baseball records. Baseball-Reference.com includes the Negro League teams considered major leagues by Major League Baseball, as reflected in the below listing (top 100). Career batting average leaders (top 10) per some alternate sources can be found at \"Batting average (baseball)#All-time leaders\".\n, no active player appears in the below list. The active player ranking highest is José Altuve, at 136th with a .3071 career batting average.\nSource:"

The Cosimo statue stands in front of the north corner of the Palazzo della Signoria, the northernmost of the row of statues, adjacent to the Fountain of Neptune (1563) by Ammannati, that had been commissioned by Cosimo himself. Together this duo celebrates the land and sea ambitions of Cosimo. The base of the statue has reliefs with scenes from the life of Cosimo, including his coronation in Rome as grand duke in 1570 and his entrance into Siena as a ruler (1557) after his victory over that republic.\nThe posture of the trotting horse in this statue is similar to those of prior statues, with right leg raised; however, unlike Marcus Aurelius, Cosimo uses stirrups and his horse shows the restraint of the bridle, albeit without much tension. Cosimo, like Gattamelata, holds a military baton, armor, and sheathed sword.\nSome sources state the man and horse were cast separately, and the combined weight of the two was 23 thousand pounds. A few decades hence, Ferdinando I would have his own equestrian monument in Piazza dell'Annunziata."

        "title": "Australian Cycling Corps",
        "text": "The Australian Cycling Corps was formed in Egypt in 1916 as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and fought on the Western Front in France and Belgium during World War I. They were used mainly as despatch riders, while also conducting reconnaissance and patrolling. It was disbanded in 1919.\nHistory.\nWhen the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was reorganised and expanded in Egypt in 1916 following its evacuation from Gallipoli, each of its five infantry divisions was allocated a company of cyclists in accordance with the British New Army establishment adopted at that time. At this time each company had an establishment of a headquarters and six cycle platoons with a total strength of 204 men. These companies were formed in March and April 1916 from volunteers from other AIF units in the Middle East. However, following their arrival in France, they were subsequently reorganised as corps troops, with the 1st and 2nd Cyclist Battalions being formed and attached to the I and II ANZAC Corps respectively in May and July. Meanwhile, a Cyclist Training Company was also formed in England. The 2nd Battalion included two companies of New Zealanders, and was commanded mostly by New Zealand officers. The establishment of each battalion included a headquarters and three companies, each of three platoons with a total of 26 officers and 310 other ranks.\nThe cyclist battalions were organised like the infantry, and were mainly used as despatch riders. Later, during the periods of semi-open warfare in 1917 and 1918 they operated in a manner similar to cavalry, conducting reconnaissance and patrolling. However, the nature of trench warfare and the mud and rubble that was often encountered on the battlefield meant that they were mostly unsuited to this role. Other tasks performed included laying communications cabling, traffic control, unloading stores from railway wagons, harvesting crops, and burial of the dead. The soldiers were equipped with a variety of bicycle models made by the Birmingham Small Arms Company, ranging from the Mark I to the Mark IV, and were issued the standard Short Magazine Lee Enfield (SMLE) rifle, which was either attached to the bicycle's down tube, or slung across their back. Lewis guns were also used.\nFollowing the formation of the Australian Corps in 1917, the II ANZAC Corps became the XXII Corps. As a result, in March 1918 the 1st Cyclist Battalion was assigned to the Australian Corps, while the Australian personnel serving in the 2nd Cyclist Battalion were returned to other units of the AIF (mainly artillery and infantry) as reinforcements and the remaining New Zealand personnel were used to form the XXII Corps Cycle Battalion. Although the battalions were not used as fighting units, their personnel were regularly exposed to the dangers of artillery fire and attacks by hostile aircraft. However, cyclist detachments were used in the last stages of the war, as the German Army withdrew to the Hindenburg Line. During the war the 1st Cyclist Battalion lost 13 men killed, while the 2nd Cyclist Battalion lost 59 dead. The Australian Corps Cyclist Battalion was disbanded on 30 April 1919. Approximately 3,000 men served in the Australian Cycling Corps, although many probably did not serve in operational units.\nUnits.\nThe corps consisted of the following units:\nNotes.\nFootnotes\nCitations"

The classification system allowed riders to compete against others with a similar level of function.\nAthletes are classified according to their functional ability when mounted across four grades and five categories (Ia and Ib, II, III and IV). The grading determines the complexity of the movements riders perform with their horses during their tests, ensuring that the tests are judged on the skill of the rider, regardless of their impairment. Riders may use permitted assistive devices such as dressage whips, connecting rein bars looped reins, and the like. Riders who have visual impairments are permitted to use 'callers' to help them navigate around the arena.\nRiders with recovering or deteriorating conditions such as MS are eligible but must have been reclassified within six months of a World Championships or Paralympic Games to ensure their classification is correct.\nSpecialised equipment including prostheses is only allowed where it has been specifically approved.\nQualification.\nThe following teams and individuals have attained quota places for the 2016 Summer Paralympics Equestrian event.

In his last-32 match, Marshall in turn led Willie Thorne 3–1, but lost 3–6. After winning his first professional play-off match against Darren Clarke 10–5, compiling his first century break, an effort of 106, in the process, he finished the season ranked 119th.\nMarshall's second season on tour brought mild success, with runs to the last 64 at the 1989 Classic and the last 32 at that year's British Open. In the former, he overcame Ian Black 5–0 and Ray Edmonds 5–2 before losing 1–5 to Tony Drago; the latter featured wins over Jim Chambers, Kirk Stevens and Bob Chaperon, but ended with a 1–5 defeat to Thorne.\nAt the 1989 International Open, Marshall reached the last-16 stage, defeating Paul Watchorn, Colin Roscoe, Dean Reynolds and Eddie Charlton before exiting 3–5 to Welshman Cliff Wilson. He registered the best performance of his career at the 1990 British Open, where his opponents en route to the semi-final included Nigel Gilbert, David Roe, Joe Johnson, Eugene Hughes and Steve Newbury. Drawn against Chaperon, Marshall led the Canadian 3–2 but, on this occasion, lost 5–9 to the eventual champion.\nRanked at a career-best 46th for the 1990/1991 season, Marshall defeated Tony Wilson of the Isle of Man, fellow Englishman Mark Johnston-Allen and South African Peter Francisco - all 10–9 - to qualify for the main stages of the 1991 World Championship, his first appearance at the Crucible Theatre. In his last-32 match against Reynolds, he led 4–2 but went on to lose 8–10.\nThe following season proved fruitless, and Marshall began 1992/1993 ranked 70th. By 1994, he had fallen further; although he won five matches to reach the last 64 at the 1995 Thailand Open - where he lost 2–5 to Jason Wallace - he concluded the season having slipped to 162nd. He had made a break of 133 in his 1995 World Championship qualifying match against Kieran McMahon, but lost 4–5 to the Northern Irishman and did not play professionally again; he was relegated from the tour in 1996, aged 31.\nAfter seventeen years out of the competitive game, Marshall entered Event 3 of the 2013 European Tour as an amateur, but lost his pre-qualifying match 3–4 to Oliver Brown."

The world championship events in all of these sports were immediately rebranded as \"World Para\" championships. At the same time, the IPC changed the official name of the sport to \"shooting Para sport\". Accordingly, future IPC shooting championships are known as \"World Shooting Para Sport Championships\".\nClassification.\nParalympic shooters were classified according to the extent of their disability. The classification system allowed shooters to compete against others with a similar level of function.\nShooting classifications are:\nWorld records.\nAt the championships eight new world records were set and one was equaled. \nMedal summary.\nMedal table.\nThis ranking sorts countries by the number of gold medals earned by their shooters (in this context a nation is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee).

        "title": "Rugby World Cup 2015 (video game)",
        "text": "Rugby World Cup 2015 is a rugby union video game developed by HB Studios.\nThe game is the official video game of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and was released worldwide on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on 4 September 2015.\nGame modes include the official Rugby World Cup tournament and a Custom Cup mode allowing players to create their own version of the tournament. All twenty teams that have qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup appear, but only ten of them are fully licensed. The England team is one of those unlicensed due to their likeness already appearing on rival game \"Rugby Challenge 3\". An edit function allows fake player names for unlicensed teams to be edited, but these only apply for exhibition and custom cup modes, the Rugby World Cup game mode retains the fake names.\nUsing the same control system that had been implemented in \"Rugby15\", the game has been overwhelmingly panned by reviewers. The lack of official squad licensing, no licensed stadiums, absence of an online game mode, poor graphics and outdated gameplay presentation has also not gone unnoticed.\nReception.\n\"Rugby World Cup 2015\" was universally panned by critics, with reviews noting that the game contained few improvements over HB Studios' similarly-criticized \"Rugby 15\"—and believing that the game was rushed so that it could be released in time for the tournament itself.\nIGN gave the game a 1.5 out of 10, noting major bugs, that the game's AI was still poorly implemented, that it still used pre-determined outcomes for tackles, and that while less buggy than the same system in \"Rugby 15\", the ruck implementation had an \"emphasis on speediness [that] results in a lot of frustration and an overall lack of control.\" In conclusion, it was felt that the game was essentially a re-branded version of \"Rugby 15\" rushed out in time for the actual World Cup. A reviewer also noted that a feature which uses statistical data to simulate matches between two sides sometimes resulted in implausible results, arguing that \"nobody is going to complain if one-thousand times out of one-thousand South Africa crushes Japan\" because \"in no reality does that happen\". Ironically, during the actual Rugby World Cup, Japan would notably upset South Africa in an opening round match.\nGamesradar was somewhat more positive on \"Rugby World Cup 2015\" in comparison to \"Rugby 15\", noting some improvements to the overall gameplay and mechanics that made the game feel more like actual rugby union, including television-styled instant replays, and being \"the first rugby title in years which rewards running hard and straight, rather prancing sideways in an attempt to glitch past defences\". However, the game was otherwise criticized for otherwise only featuring minor improvements over \"Rugby 15\", commenting that \"there's nothing here that suggests an understanding of scrums—which is forgivable, since most international referees don't either—but there's certainly no attempt to twist the complex battle of binding, shoving and probably-biting into something that belongs in a game. Instead, it's reduced to 'hook' and 'push'.\" It was also pointed out that half of the game's teams (including, ironically, tournament host England) were not licensed and thus composed of fictional players, and that none of the tournament's actual venues were featured either. Giving \"Rugby World Cup 2015\" 2 out of 5 stars, what improvements were present in the game were considered \"nothing more than a fig leaf which barely covers the game's otherwise gruesome nudity.\""

        "text": "Javier Alexis Guerra (born September 25, 1995) is a Panamanian professional baseball pitcher for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Guerra began his career as an infielder, reaching MLB as such in 2018 with the San Diego Padres, before converting to pitching in 2019. He has also played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays and Milwaukee Brewers.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Red Sox.\nGuerra signed as a shortstop with the Boston Red Sox as an international free agent in 2012, coming to terms on a contract calling for a reported signing bonus of $250,000. At the time Guerra drew mixed reviews for his defense because he had fringy speed, but he showed a very quick first step and excellent range to both sides. He had very soft but quick hands and was assured in the field, which complemented his arm, perhaps the strongest in the Red Sox system.\nGuerra made his professional debut with the Rookie league Dominican Summer League Red Sox in 2013, hitting .248/.356/.290 with nine doubles and 23 runs batted in in 60 games. He then played for the Rookie league Gulf Coast Red Sox in 2014, batting .269/.286/.408 with two home runs and 26 RBI in the Gulf Coast League.\nHe had a breakout season with the Class A Greenville Drive in 2015, where he displayed highlight-reel defensive plays at shortstop with the ability to drive the ball. Guerra put up a .279/.329/.449 slash line with 68 RBI, along with 23 doubles, three triples and 15 home runs in a career-high 116 games, while earning a selection to the South Atlantic League All-Star Game. In addition, Guerra ranked among the best hitters in the Red Sox system, ending second in home runs, third in RBI and total bases (195), fourth in slugging (.449) and fifth in runs scored (64). On defense, he made 27 errors at shortstop, and had a .954 fielding percentage.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn November 13, 2015, the Red Sox traded Guerra, Carlos Asuaje, Manuel Margot, and Logan Allen to the San Diego Padres for Craig Kimbrel. He spent 2016 with the High-A Lake Elsinore Storm, where he batted .202/.264/.325 with nine home runs and 41 RBIs in 105 games, as on defense he made 30 errors at shortstop and had a .940 fielding percentage. The Padres added him to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season.\nHe spent 2017 with Lake Elsinore and the Double-A San Antonio Missions, batting .222/.266/.349 with nine home runs and 53 RBIs in 128 games between both teams. He began 2018 with the Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas, for whom he batted .223/.269/.398 in 122 games. Through 2018, in 582 minor league games he had batted .237/.290/.374, while playing nearly all the games at shortstop.\nGuerra was called up to the majors for the first time on May 4, 2018 and made his MLB debut that night. In 16 at-bats in 2018 with the Padres, he batted .125 with one RBI.\nConversion to pitcher.\nDuring 2019 spring training, Guerra was converted into a relief pitcher. Guerra opened the season on the injured list due to an oblique injury. After being activated, he was assigned to Lake Elsinore. He was promoted to the Amarillo Sod Poodles on August 20. On September 1, Guerra was promoted to the major leagues as a pitcher for the first time.\nIn 2020, Guerra pitched to a 1-0 record with a 10.13 ERA and 12 strikeouts in 13.1 innings of work across 14 appearances. On April 5, 2021, Guerra was placed on the 60-day injured list with a grade 1 UCL sprain. On September 21, Guerra was activated off of the injured list.\nOn April 13, 2022, Guerra was designated for assignment by the Padres following the waiver claim of Kyle Tyler. He had allowed four runs in 2.0 innings pitched two days prior against the Arizona Diamondbacks in his only appearance of the season.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn April 16, 2022, the Padres traded Guerra to the Tampa Bay Rays for cash considerations. He pitched to an 8.44 ERA across six appearances for the Rays before he was designated for assignment on May 1. On May 6, Guerra cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Durham Bulls. He was promoted back to the active roster on June 30, 2022. He was returned to Triple-A on July 4, 2022. He had his contract selected on September 12. On November 15, Guerra was designated for assignment.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn November 18, 2022, the Rays traded Guerra to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for a player to be named later. He made 8 appearances for Milwaukee in 2023, struggling to an 8.64 ERA with 5 strikeouts in 8.1 innings pitched. On April 24, 2023, Guerra was designated for assignment by Milwaukee following the promotion of Alex Claudio.\nTampa Bay Rays (second stint).\nOn April 29, 2023, Guerra was traded back to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for cash considerations. In 6 appearances for the Rays, Guerra surrendered 2 runs across 5.0 innings pitched (3.60 ERA), walking 9 and striking out 4. On May 14, Guerra was designated for assignment. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to the Triple-A Durham Bulls on May 17. On July 8, the Rays selected Guerra back to the major league roster. In 3 games for Tampa Bay, he allowed three earned runs on three hits and four walks. On July 19, Guerra was again designated for assignment. On October 9, Guerra elected free agency.\nHanshin Tigers.\nOn November 18, 2023, Guerra signed with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\nInternational career.\nOn August 13, 2022, Guerra was named as part of the Panama national baseball team roster for the 2023 World Baseball Classic qualifiers, to be played at Estadio Nacional Rod Carew in Panama City."

        "title": "Swimming injuries",
        "text": "Swimming injuries have many different causes, and can occur immediately or can occur as the result of a long-term swimming career. Some ways that swimmers can increase the risk of an injury are by overuse of a specific part of the body, lacking crucial flexibility and strength, etc. These injuries, like swimmer's shoulder and breaststroker’s knee, cause pain to the swimmer in certain regions that permit necessary movement for the required precise technique. Although these injuries can halt a professional swimmer's career, many can be treated and some can even be prevented. There are different procedures and exercises that can either prevent an injury or help with recovering from an injury. Many of the exercises are specific to the injury and vary in helpfulness according to the person and the technique used for the exercise.\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, competitive swimmers are at higher than average risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization among children and teenagers.\nSwimmer's Shoulder.\nSwimmer's Shoulder is the name given to a broad range of repetitive motion injuries that typically occur in swimmers. Typical swim-related shoulder pain occurs in the front and side of the upper shoulder complex. Pain often will radiate into the upper arm or can extend into the lower neck and upper back region. Pain associated with Swimmer's Shoulder often starts as an irritating soreness following swim training and can persist, escalating to a constant, intense pain that limits shoulder mobility and ultimately athletic performance.\nWhile there are a number of contributing factors leading to the development of Swimmer's Shoulder, it is believed that the three main causes of Swimmer's Shoulder are: 1. faulty swim stroke technique, 2. repetitive use with inadequate rest, and 3. overdeveloped anterior shoulder and chest musculature.\nThe primary cause of Swimmer's Shoulder is faulty biomechanics due to improper swim stroke technique. Professional swim coaches are trained on finding and correcting improper swim stroke technique before it becomes a problem for the athlete. Correcting the swimmer's technique is key to the recovery process. If a swimmer is allowed to continue with improper technique, repetitive irritation of the shoulder structures occurs, eventually creating a \"pincher-type impingement\" within the shoulder. Elevating the arm and forward circumduction of the shoulder becomes painful. A few examples of improper techniques that can contribute to a swimmer's Shoulder are initiating an arm pull before finishing a breath, training with unilateral breathing, and faulty hand placement during entry.\nAnother cause of Swimmer's Shoulder is repetitive use with inadequate rest. Overuse of the shoulder muscles and surrounding muscles can lead to fatigue of the muscles. When muscles are fatigued, they respond less effectively. With each stroke, biomechanics break down causing vital structures to inflame. If the soft tissue structures such as tendons and ligaments are not given enough time to repair and for the swelling to resolve, the structures can become damaged.\nTreatment methods.\nSome treatment methods include; warming up slowly prior to training, avoiding strokes and positions that cause pain (butterfly or freestyle), fixing any bad technique that could be causing the pain, adjusting the distance and frequency of training to avoid further overuse of the muscles, discontinue the use of paddles, increase kick sets to allow the shoulder to rest however limit the use of kickboards and avoid pulling sets. Increase the use of fins to assist with maintaining a good body position and to avoid drag, avoid dry land upper body weight training, ice the shoulder daily, consider the use of anti-inflammatory creams and medicines, and seek the advice of a medical professional.\nBreaststroker's Knee.\nBreaststroker’s Knee is the name given to pain felt within and around the knee that is experienced by swimmers. It is named this due to the fact it is most commonly only breaststrokers that experience pain within the knee and around the knee. Most swimmers will have no problems with their knees however ‘the majority (86%) of breaststroke swimmers will have experienced knee pain at one point in their career and 47.2% of them will have had this problem at least one time every week.’ \nThere are several factors that increase the swimmer's chances of developing knee pain and inflammation of the knee muscles such as the increasing age of the swimmer, the length of the competitive career, the length of the event, inadequate warm-up, strength imbalance of hip abductors/adductors and flexibility imbalance of hip abductors/adductors.\nPrevention and treatment.\nIn order to prevent the development of knee pain and inflammation of the knee muscles it is recommended that swimmers use a well-designed strength and stretching program, warm up adequately, use the correct breaststroke kick technique, gradually build up the distance of breaststroke swimming and a balanced training program that focuses on not only breaststroke and also has training sessions that allows for adequate recovery of the knee muscles to prevent fatigue of the muscles causing overuse, inflammation, and pain.\nTreatment of breaststroker's knee includes resting the knee muscles, icing daily, elevating the limb, strengthening and stretching, support e.g. strapping or knee braces, seeking medical advice which can lead to physiotherapy, cortisone injections, and in few cases surgery."

        "text": "The 1969–70 Serie A basketball championship was the 47th season of the Serie A, the highest professional basketball league in Italy.\nThe regular season ran from 2 November 1969 to 12 April 1970, twelve teams played 22 games each. The team ranked first at the end of the season, Ignis Varese, was crowned champion (earning the single spot in the European Champions Cup) whilst the two lowest ranked teams, Splugen Brau Gorizia and Brill Cagliari, were relegated to the Serie A.\nIgnis Varese won their second consecutive league title, fourth overall.\nSeason narrative.\nPreseason.\nAll clubs were allowed only one foreign player though the two clubs engaged in European competition (Ignis Varese and Fides Napoli) recruited another one to play in those competitions and All'Onesta' Milano's Tony Gennari, an American of Italian heritage, had controversially been naturalised as an Italian a few years prior.\nNearly all of those foreigners were American, with Varese's Manuel Raga - from Mexico - a notable exception.\nThe only two clubs without a sponsored name - widely the major source of revenue for clubs - were Virtus Bologna, who had chosen to keep their name intact, and Pallacanestro Cantù, whose sponsor Oransoda had withdrawn from basketball sponsorship.\nIgnis Varese, who had won both the domestic league and cup the previous season, was seen as the strong favourite to retain its title, with Simmenthal Milano, All'Onesta' Milano, Virtus Bologna and Fides Napoli cited as their main adversaries.\nThe defending champions had named Aleksandar Nikolić as coach and reinforced a squad already containing Raga, Dino Meneghin, Aldo Ossola and Ottorino Flaborea with former league top-scorer Paolo Vittori, Simmenthal had two arrivals (including Renzo Bariviera) for two departures, with the form of key duo Massimo Masini and Jim Tillman cause for concern, All'Onesta' were counting on American pair Gennari and Joe Isaac, Virtus Bologna - led by captain Dado Lombardi and 1969 NBA draft fourth-pick Terry Driscoll with recent Italy coach Nello Paratore at the helm - were seen as the dark horse for the title, with Napoli – minus Vittori – described as having a competitive but aging squad.\nRegular season.\nAfter nine straight wins to open the season, Varese was undone 73-76 after one overtime by Simmenthal Milano on 11 January 1970, allowing the Milanese to close the gap between the two front runners to two points.\nThe Ignis-sponsored club lost only once more, an 80-88 defeat to Snaidero Udine on 22 March 1970, right before playing Real Madrid in the European Champions Cup.\nAn 82-72 win over Simmenthal during the penultimate game on 6 April took Varese's lead to an unassailable six points over Milano, the only serious contender for the title during a season which saw the holders in near unattainable form, adding the European Champions Cup, Italian Cup and Intercontinental Cup later that year.\nThe last round of the season took part on 12 April, with only honour at stake, Brill Cagliari - relegated long before with only two wins - upset Virtus Bologna 81-77 at home to earn their third win, the only notable result as all top-ranked sides won.\nIt was another setback for Virtus, who failed to meet predictions as they finished eighth, far behind both Milano squads and Napoli who placed according to forecasts.\nSplugen Brau Gorizia, the other promoted side that season besides Cagliari, had seen their relegation confirmed the previous round, despite their player Elnardo Webster leading the league in scoring with 593 points (26.9 per game) to Raga's 558 (25.4 pg).\nStandings.\nSource: Lega Basket\nIndividual scoring table.\n\"Source: unofficial statistics compiled by Giganti del Basket magazine (official statistics started from the 1975–76 season).\"\nItalian Cup.\nIgnis Varese also won the Italian Cup after beating Simmenthal Milano 75-66 in the final, played in Rome on 19 April 1970.

Racers then went past Meadow Event Park, home to the State Fair of Virginia and the birthplace of thoroughbred racing legend Secretariat. Racers headed south on long, open straights past the Hanover County Courthouse, the third oldest courthouse still in use in the U.S. and dating back to about 1740. Long hills on Brook and Wilkinson roads brought the racers back into the city through Virginia Union University before turning downtown. Nearly half the turns of the entire route fell within the closing kilometers, the second to last of which was to ascend on Governor Street.

        "text": "Over the course of 129 seasons (from 1892 to 2023 excluding 1981, 1994, and 2020), 116 teams have won 100 or more games in a single Major League Baseball season. While this makes the feat a relatively common occurrence, the 100-win threshold remains the hallmark of the best teams in a given season.\nThe franchise with the most 100-win seasons is the New York Yankees, who have done so 21 times, with the Los Angeles Dodgers being second with eleven occasions. Sixty different managers have led a team to a 100-win season, with only one occasion where a 100-win team was led by multiple managers. Twenty-four managers have led a franchise to two or more 100-win seasons; Sparky Anderson, Whitey Herzog, Tony La Russa, Dusty Baker and Buck Showalter are the only managers to have led multiple franchises to a 100-win season. Joe McCarthy and Bobby Cox have the most 100-win seasons by a manager with six. Seven of the 30 major league franchises have never recorded a season with 100 wins. Among rookie managers, seven have accomplished 100 wins in their inaugural season, with the first being Mickey Cochrane in 1934 and the last being Rocco Baldelli in 2019. 68 of the 116 100-win teams have advanced to the World Series (), with 38 of them going on to win the Series (for a percentage of ), while 23 teams that have won 100 games have lost in the first round of the postseason, with 22 being in the Division Series and one being in the Wild Card Series (introduced in 2022 full-time).\nListed below are the Major League Baseball franchises that have had seasons with 100 or more wins.\nDistinctions.\nOn eight occasions, the level of high-quality competition within a league or division has resulted in a team winning 100 games but still failing to qualify for postseason play. Six of these eight seasons occurred before the start of the two-division league structure and expanded playoff format introduced in 1969, and none have occurred since the first year under the Divisional Series format in 1995.\nWhile there have been 25 seasons with two or more 100-win teams, only ten times have at least three teams finished at or above the mark, and 2019 and 2022 are the only instances of four teams finishing at or above the 100-win threshold.\nThe 2018 season was the first time both leagues had more than two teams win 100 or more games in the same season; the Boston Red Sox, Houston Astros, and New York Yankees of the American League each won 100 or more games, with two led by rookie managers (no season had ever seen more than 100 wins from two managers before). There were no 100-win teams in the National League that season. The 2019 season marked the first time four Major League teams won 100 or more games, with the American League's Houston Astros, New York Yankees, and Minnesota Twins winning their divisions with at least 100 wins, and the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League doing the same.\nWith the Divisional Series and Wild Card format in place today, it is extremely unlikely for a team with a 100-win regular season to fail to qualify for at least a Wild Card berth. Only the 2001 Oakland Athletics, the 2018 New York Yankees, the 2021 Los Angeles Dodgers and the 2022 New York Mets made the playoffs as 100-win Wild Card teams.\nThe following teams missed the postseason despite winning 100 games or more during the regular season:"

By the end of the straightaway, he was overtaken by new M50 1500 metres world record holder David Heath. Through the turn Michael Sherar was able to work his way around Wang and Lebourne tried to follow, but tripped and spent several strides trying to regain his balance. Wang entered the home stretch a bit wide giving Lebourne an opening to squeeze through. Heath hit the bell at 59.73 two seconds up, with Lebourne just passing Sherar to take over second place. 1988 Olympian Paul Osland led the rest of the field past Wang along the back stretch while Lebourne separated from pack now more than 20 metres behind Heath who hit 600 metres at 1:28.57. Onto the home stretch, Heath looked powerful way ahead of the field. Lebourne began to struggle, ten metres out from the finish line, Gunnar Rune Durén went by, then Sherar dipped by a step before the finish line for bronze.\nLebourne's time of 2:03.75 fully automatic time is technically better than Stan Immelmann's hand timed 2:03.7 M55 world record from January 2001. Lebrun ran 2:02.16, a significantly faster time, indoors in February. As of December 2015, WMA has not ratified Lebourne for the world record, USATF ratified his 2:04.79 performance in Lyon as the American record."

He is the brother of fellow snooker player Alex Davies.\nCareer.\nDavies competed as an amateur in his early teens before reaching the last 32, at three Challenge Tour events in the 2003/2004 season. These performances, coupled with a run to the last 128 at the 2004 World Snooker Championship, earned him a place on the professional tour for the following two seasons.\nIn his first season, as a professional, Davies won four matches, defeating Darren Morgan in the 2004 British Open, Paul Davies in the 2005 Welsh Open, Simon Bedford in the 2005 China Open and, latterly, the former world number six Mike Hallett 10–5 in the World Championship. However, he did not progress beyond the last 80 at any event, and earned no prize money.\nDavies' second season on tour proved no better; entering seven tournaments, he played six matches and won only one. His 5–4 victory over Bjorn Haneveer in the 2006 China Open led to a meeting with Justin Astley in the last 80, which he did lead 3–1, but lost 3–5. At the last 96 stage of the 2006 World Championship, Davies was defeated 7–10 by Mark Allen; he was ranked 89th at the season's conclusion, and lost his professional status.\nDavies entered qualifying events to regain his place on tour the following season; he reached the semi-final at one of these but, needing to win to re-qualify, remained an amateur. Further attempts in the 2007/2008 and 2009/2010 seasons were also without success."

The Padang became a major recreational area when two clubs, the Singapore Cricket Club in 1870 and the Singapore Recreation Club in 1883 were established at both ends of the field. It was used for exercising horses in the 1920s and became the scene for the New Year sporting activities.\nCricket's development in the colony took a back seat due to the world wars, However, after World War II the ground played host to teams such as the touring Australians of 1959. In 2003 came the club was given the go-ahead to pursue extensive re-development to the cost of $17 million, the first change to its structure for nearly 120 years. Improvements include the appropriately named Stumps bar which boasts an outdoor seating area and views of the ground. Further modernisations have improved the gym and other sporting facilities, In 1996 Padang Cricket Ground became the first venue in Singapore to host One Day International (ODI's).

        "title": "Oregon Ducks women's basketball",
        "text": "The Oregon Ducks women's basketball team is the official women's basketball team of the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. Basketball is one of 11 varsity women's sports at the University of Oregon. The team is a member of the Pac-12 Conference and a Division I team in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Matthew Knight Arena is the home venue for both women's and men's basketball and women's volleyball. Nike provides the official team uniforms for University of Oregon sports teams.\nHistory.\nWomen's basketball (as a zoned, single-dribble game) at the University of Oregon started as a club in 1899, brought to Oregon by physical education instructor Alice Chapman, wife of University President Charles Chapman. With a women's intercollegiate game emerging at Willamette University, Oregon Agricultural College, Pacific University, and elsewhere, an effort was made during the 1902–03 academic year to organize a women's university team. This effort was waylaid by the Oregon faculty athletic committee early in January 1903, however, with the committee deeming it \"not advisable\" for the \"young ladies' basketball team\" to enter into intercollegiate games. Instead, it was hoped that two campus teams could be organized to keep competition on a local level.\nThe sport became an \"interest group\" in 1965. Intercollegiate games also began in 1965, and in 1966, the women's team entered the Northwest College Women's Sports Association (which would eventually become the AIAW Region 9 conference). The program became official in 1973, the year following the passage of Title IX, which required federally supported universities to offer equal opportunities in men's and women's athletics. They have an all-time record (as of the end of the 2015–16 season) of 706–507. They previously played in the Northwest Basketball League from 1977 to 1982 (47–5 all-time record) and the NorPac Conference from 1982 to 1986 (34–12 all-time record) before the Pacific-10 Conference, now known as the Pac-12 Conference, began sponsoring women's sports in 1986. The Ducks' current all-time conference record is 260–280. They won the Women's National Invitation Tournament in 2002 54–52 over Houston.\nIndividual accomplishments.\nIndividual National Award Winners.\nPlayers\nIndividual Conference Award Winners.\n† Shared Award\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Ducks have appeared in 17 NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 17–16.\nHistorical NCAA Tournament Seeding.\nPac-10/12 Tournament Seeding\nCoaching history.\nJane Spearing coached the first official season for the Ducks in 1973–74. The team finished that season with a 3–8 losing record. The 1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons were coached by Nancy Mikleton and the team posted 2–10 and 5–15 records, respectively. Head coach Elwin Heiny took over the program in 1976 and remained coach until 1993. Heiny was the first full-time coach hired for women's basketball. In his first season as head coach, Heiny coached the team to its first winning record (11–6). Jody Runge took over as head coach in 1993 and coached until 2001. She coached the Ducks to NCAA tournament appearances during each of her eight seasons as coach. Runge also spoke out for equality in women's athletics. From 2001 to 2009, former Oregon Ducks All-American Bev Smith coached the team, posting an 83–69 overall record. Paul Westhead coached the Ducks from the 2009–10 season through the 2013–14 season. The current head coach is Kelly Graves, assisted by Associate Head Coach Mark Campbell, and Assistant Coaches Jodie Berry and Xavi López.\nFacilities.\nThe early women's basketball clubs played in Gerlinger Hall on the University of Oregon campus, built in 1927 to serve as the women's gymnasium. Games eventually moved to McArthur Court (also called Mac Court and \"The Pit\") — one of the most renowned college athletic facilities of all time. Admission was first charged for women's games at Mac Court in 1978. The Ducks relocated when Matthew Knight Arena opened in 2011. In their first game in Matthew Knight, the women's team defeated Oregon State University in the \"Civil War,\" 81–72.\nStatistical leaders.\nCurrent through Oregon's game against Oregon State on December 13, 2020.

        "title": "Vaqueros de Bayamón (baseball)",
        "text": "The Vaqueros de Bayamón was a professional baseball club which played from 1974 through 2003 in the Professional Baseball League of Puerto Rico. The Vaqueros joined the league as a replacement team for the departed Senadores de San Juan. They were based in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, and played their home games at Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium.\nThe Vaqueros won league pennants in the 1974–75, 1975–76, 1979–80 and 2001–02 seasons, winning the championship in its inaugural season and the right to represent Puerto Rico in the 1975 Caribbean Series, which was held at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Bayamón club clinched the Series and was managed by José Pagán, winning five games in a row before losing to the Dominican Republic's Águilas Cibaeñas in the closing game, 5 to 4.\nLeading the offensive charge in the Series was Ken Griffey, Sr., who won the batting title with a .500 average (12-for-24) and scored the most runs in the tournament (eight). Other contributions came from Félix Millán, who hit .435 (10-for-23) for the second best average, and Willie Montañez, who led all hitters with 11 runs batted in and tied for the most home runs (2), earning Most Valuable Player honors.\nThe Puerto Rican team also had a well-balanced lineup that included Orlando Álvarez, Sergio Ferrer, Art Howe, Jay Johnstone, Jerry Morales and Eliseo Rodríguez. On the other side, the pitching staff was headed by John Montague, who hurled a four-hit shutout, backed up by Tom Walker and Tom Hilgendorf, each winners in their respective starts. A solid bullpen was anchored by John Candelaria, Ed Figueroa, Jaime Navarro and Carlos Velázquez.\nIn the 2001–02 season Bayamón was the team nobody picked to win the Puerto Rican league crown. Nevertheless, the franchise that Carlos Baerga saved from bankruptcy two seasons prior headed to their first Caribbean Series since 1980. Since Baerga bought the ailing club it had failed to even make the playoffs. Then this time the underdog Vaqueros managed by Carmelo Martínez beat the highly favored Cangrejeros de Santurce of Mako Oliveras in the championship series, being guided by Baerga, who posted a .500 batting average with three RBI and seven runs scored, leading him subsequently to be named series MVP en route to the 2002 Caribbean Series.\nBut the Vaqueros failed from Day 1 at the Caribbean Series held in Caracas, Venezuela. Bayamón's import pitching, solid and sharp in the Puerto Rico playoffs, opted not to join the team for the trip. As a result, none of Bayamón's emergency starters in its first three games in Caracas made it past the fifth inning. It was not until Game 4 with the team 0–3 and all but mathematically eliminated from contention, that Puerto Rico won a game on a solid pitching effort. The team that Baerga built pulled out an 8–4 victory over their rivals Tigres del Licey of the Dominican Republic, with Omar Olivares allowing just four hits and two runs over seven innings of work. But was too late for Puerto Rico, whose role in the tournament would be as a spoiler for the other three teams, ending with a 2–4 record while tying for third place with the local Navegantes de Magallanes, behind Mexico's Tomateros de Culiacán (5–1) and the Dominican's Tigres del Licey (3–3).\nBeside the aforementioned, the Vaqueros also featured players as Luis Aguayo, Benny Ayala, Carlos Beltrán, Dave Bergman, Tony Bernazard, Wade Boggs, Doug Corbett, Héctor Cruz, Dan Driessen, Darrell Evans, Tim Foli, Rubén Gómez, Tony Gwynn, Odell Jones, Frank LaCorte, Ricky Ledée, Doug Linton, Héctor Mercado, Kevin McReynolds, José Morales, John Rocker, Benito Santiago, Dave Smith, Dickie Thon and Denny Walling, among others in the history of the team.\nThe Vaqueros de Bayamón folded in 2003 after the league was unable to find a new owner."

Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 to win a record-extending 13th title, their third title in a row and fourth in five seasons.\nAs winners, Real Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative for the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, Atlético Madrid, in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup, winning the former. Additionally, they would have been automatically qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stage, but since they had already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the champions of the 2017–18 Czech First League, the 11th-ranked association according to the 2018–19 access list.\nThis edition of the Champions League was particularly influenced by controversial refereeing decisions, such as two clear penalties not given to AS Roma in the semifinal. These controversies were among the reasons that pushed UEFA to introduce VAR in the competition starting from the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League.\nAssociation team allocation.\n79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nKosovo, who became a UEFA member on 3 May 2016, made their debut in the UEFA Champions League.\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2016 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2011–12 to 2015–16.\nApart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\nDistribution.\nIn the default access list, the Champions League title holders entered the group stage. However, since Real Madrid already qualified for the group stage (as the champions of the 2016–17 La Liga), the Champions League title holders berth in the group stage was given to the Europa League title holders, Manchester United. and the following changes to the default allocation system are made:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season qualified via league position shown in parentheses. Manchester United qualified as Europa League title holders.

Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nThird qualifying round.\nThe third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: Champions Route (for league champions) and League Route (for league non-champions). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League play-off round.\nPlay-off round.\nThe play-off round was split into two separate sections: Champions Route (for league champions) and League Route (for league non-champions). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League group stage.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 24 August 2017, 18:00 CEST, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (introduced starting 2015–16 season):\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League round of 32. The matchdays were 12–13 September, 26–27 September, 17–18 October, 31 October – 1 November, 21–22 November, and 5–6 December 2017.\nThe youth teams of the clubs that qualified for the group stage also participated in the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League on the same matchdays, where they competed in the UEFA Champions League Path (the youth domestic champions of the top 32 associations competed in a separate Domestic Champions Path until the play-offs).\nSeventeen national associations were represented in the group stage. Qarabağ and RB Leipzig made their debut appearances in the group stage. Qarabağ were the first team from Azerbaijan to play in the Champions League group stage. For the first time since the 1997–98 edition, England's Arsenal did not qualify for the group stage.\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.\nSquad of the season.\nThe UEFA technical study group selected the following 18 players as the squad of the tournament.\nPlayers of the season.\nVotes were cast for players of the season by coaches of the 32 teams in the group stage, together with 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, representing each of UEFA's member associations. The coaches were not allowed to vote for players from their own teams. Jury members selected their top three players, with the first receiving five points, the second three and the third one. The shortlist of the top three players were announced on 9 August 2018.

        "text": "Davis Cup Tennis (known in Europe as Davis Cup) is a 2002 tennis video game for the Game Boy Advance developed by Hokus Pokus Games and published by Ubisoft.\nIn the game's two game modes, the player assumes control of either a tennis player during a single match or an entire country's team in the Davis Cup, an international competition. Multiplayer is supported through the link cable. The game garnered mixed reviews from critics, who overall felt that it paled in comparison to 2002's \"Virtua Tennis\" and earlier versions of \"Mario Tennis\".\nGameplay.\nThe game follows the rules of tennis closely. Each match has a minimum of 5 sets by default. Players are able to control the difficulty of the AI before starting their game as well. The player can either choose to play a \"Quick Play\" mode which allows for a single tennis match, or to play through the full Davis Cup, where the player must choose the team captain and compete through the entire tournament with the rotating player rotation.\nThe tennis players are represented by two-dimensional sprites, while the court is given the illusion of being three-dimensional. Players are able to control the power of their initial serve, but cannot control how hard they hit balls already in play.\nReception.\n\"Davis Cup Tennis\" garnered mixed reviews from gaming press, who felt that the game was lackluster compared to \"Virtua Tennis\". GameSpot's Frank Provo and IGN's Craig Harris both criticized the lack of an in-game save option that you could activate during your match, with Craig Harris remarking that the design \"isn't exactly handheld friendly\". Frank Provo felt that the larger variety of techniques found in \"Virtua Tennis\" made it \"the better option\". GameSpy's Avi Fryman remarked on the game's averageness in comparison to its competitors, commenting \"... if all available copies of \"Virtua Tennis\" and \"Mario Tennis\" suddenly vaporized, there might be a reason for casual gamers to pick this one up.\""

The two first-class matches were both drawn and Sri Lanka won the ODI series against Ireland 2–0.\nIn April 2016, the ECB made a proposal that the series uses a points-based scoring system across all three formats, with both teams agreeing to the idea in principle. The following month, the points system was named \"Super Series\" and approved for this series and England's series against Pakistan. Four points were awarded for winning a Test match and two points for wins in ODIs or T20Is matches. No overall trophy was awarded, but there was a prize of £25,000, to be split amongst the players. England won the Super Series 20–4.\nEngland.\nSquads.\nKusal Perera replaced Dhammika Prasad in Sri Lanka's Test squad.

Dushmantha Chameera suffered a stress fracture in his lower back and was ruled out of the tour. Chaminda Bandara was named as Chameera's replacement. Following the ODI matches in Ireland, Shaminda Eranga was admitted to hospital in Dublin to undergo tests on his heart. However, on the same day, he was suspended from bowling in international matches by the International Cricket Council (ICC) due to an illegal action reported during the second Test. Prior to the third ODI, Lahiru Thirimanne was ruled out of the rest of the series with a lower back strain."

        "text": "The FIFA Women's Club World Cup is an international women's association football competition that is proposed by the \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body.\nHistory.\nThe International Women's Club Championship (IWCC) was the first international annual competition contested by women's champion clubs. The competition was founded and organised by the Japan Football Association and the L. League. The first International Women's Club Championship took place in Japan in November 2012 with participation from four teams: Olympique Lyonnais (Europe), Canberra United (Australia), INAC Kobe Leonessa (Japan) and NTV Beleza (cup winner, Japan).\nIn October 2012, L-League's senior executive, Yoshinori Taguchi, announced that he intended the IWCC run for three years and expand to include more continental champions. It was also envisaged that FIFA would ultimately endorse the tournament as a female equivalent of the FIFA Club World Cup.\nIn October 2013, FIFA's executive committee heard a proposal from their Women's Football Task Force to explore the idea of an official FIFA Women's Club World Cup. The board of the Brazilian club São José, winner of the 2013 Copa Libertadores Femenina, went so far as to say that FIFA had approved the holding of an interclub tournament between the South American champions and 2012–13 UEFA Women's Champions League champions VfL Wolfsburg during 2014. However, the proposed match between the two continental champions never progressed beyond the planning stages.\nIn 2015 the FIFA Women's Football Task Force again proposed the creation of the FIFA Women's Club World Cup. The Task Force also proposed an increase in teams and in development of competitions at confederation level in relation to the FIFA Women's Club World Cup.\nA friendly played between Arsenal L.F.C. (FA Women's Cup holders) and Seattle Reign FC (NWSL Shield holders) on 26 May 2016 (finished with a draw of 1–1) at Memorial Stadium in Seattle was described as \"a stepping stone to the grand idea of a FIFA Women's Club World Cup.\"\nIn 2017, Chief Women's Football Officer Sarai Bareman mentioned the possibility of a Women's Club World Cup, in saying that \"we have to be very careful about how we introduce it, when we introduce it and it has to include all regions. As you well know, not all regions are at the same development level but there’s an amazing opportunity that exists, but we have to be very strategic and careful about how we do it.\"\nDuring the closing press conference for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, president Gianni Infantino outlined a proposal for the creation of the tournament \"starting as soon as possible\" as a step towards the future development of women's football. In December 2022 FIFA announced plans to establish a Women's Club World Cup, but the women's football calendar would remain unchanged until 2025.\nIn January 2024, \"The Athletic\" reports that FIFA aims for an inaugural Women's Club World Cup in 2026."

        "text": "John Giles (born 24 July 1969) is an English former professional snooker player.\nCareer.\nBorn in 1969, Giles turned professional in 1992. In his debut season, he won the majority of the matches he played, but due to the vast number of players competing in qualifying for each event, did not progress beyond the last 128 of any of the ranking tournaments for most of that season. He won six matches in the 1992 Dubai Classic but was defeated by Mark Davis 1–5 in the seventh qualifying round, losing his eighth match in that year's Grand Prix also to Davis by the same scoreline, and lost 4–5 to Andrew Cairns in the last 128 at the British Open.\nAt the 1993 World Championship, qualifying for which was held near the start of the season, Giles defeated Tessa Davidson 5–3, Stan Haslam 5–1, Paul Maskell by the same scoreline, Barry Bunn 5–2, Simon Haggerty 5–0, Jamie Woodman 5–2, Andrew Cairns 10–2, Tony Meo 10–9, John Campbell 10–3 and Tony Knowles 10–6 to reach the last 32 stage - the first round at the Crucible Theatre.\nGiles had won ten matches to qualify for the televised stages of the tournament, a feat bettered only by Spencer Dunn, who won eleven matches in the same event. In the event, Giles could not replicate his stellar form in his match against Steve James; he held James to 1–3 but came to trail 1–9. Although Giles won the eleventh frame and had left James requiring a snooker in the next, James recovered to win it 73–70, and was victorious by ten frames to two.\nReaching the Crucible earned Giles £8,000, but his best performance the following season was a run to the last 96 of the 1993 UK Championship, where he lost 1–5 to a resurgent Alex Higgins. In spite of his poor form, Giles reached his highest ranking, 108th, for the 1994/1995 season.\nGiles progressed to the last 96 at two ranking events the following season; at the 1994 UK Championship, he lost 4–5 to Danny Fowler, and at the 1995 British Open, Steve Newbury defeated him 5–2.\nSome success came in 1995/1996; Giles reached the last 32 at the 1996 Welsh Open, defeating Hugh Abernethy, Joe Jogia, Les Dodd and Martin Clark before being whitewashed 5–0 by Drew Henry.\nThe following season, Giles met Steve Davis in the last 64 at the 1996 Grand Prix, where he lost 2–5.\nHaving lost his professional status at the end of the 1996/1997 season, Giles entered ten qualifying events to regain it for the following season, and was successful. However, he dropped off the tour once more in 1999, aged 29. Giles' last professional match was another against Dodd, in the 1999 World Championship; on this occasion, Dodd won their third-round qualifying encounter 10–8."

His debut season featured a run to the last 32 of the 1992 Asian Open, where he lost 4–5 to Steve Campbell, and the last 64 at both the 1991 UK Championship - losing to Gary Wilkinson 5–9 having led 5–3 - and the 1992 British Open, where he was defeated 5–1 by Nigel Bond. The season included victories over Peter Francisco, Andy Hicks, Barry Pinches and most notably, in the 1992 European Open, a 5–0 whitewash of John Spencer, who played only one more match before his retirement that year.\nReardon's world ranking rose to 88th for the 1992/1993 season; he next made any progress in a ranking event at the 1993 European Open, where he lost in the last 64, 3–5 to Noppadon Noppachorn.\nIn 1995, after several years of poor form, Reardon progressed to the last 64 at the Grand Prix and the last 32 of the UK Championship, losing 3–5 to Jason Ferguson in the former and 4–9 to Jimmy White in the latter. En route to reaching the last 16 of that season's Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, Reardon had beaten nineteen-year-old Stuart Bingham 5–1, in the process making a break of 115.\nReardon dropped off the tour in 1997 as the world number 129, but successfully re-qualified in time for the 1998/1999 season. Earning only £405 during that season, he was again forced to qualify, and again, despite losing all of his qualifying matches, he was successful. At the 2000 UK Championship, he reached the last 96, his best showing for several years; there, he again met Bingham, and Bingham this time compiled a century break of his own in defeating Reardon 5–2.\nHaving finished the 2000/2001 season ranked 139th, Reardon lost his professional status for a third time, at the age of 32. He attempted to regain his place over the following two seasons, but was unable to progress far enough in any tournament to do so.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1992, Reardon was jailed for six months for reckless driving, following an incident in January of that year which resulted in the deaths of two of his passengers, fellow snooker players Martin Carolan and Chris Brooks."

        "text": "The individual show jumping event, part of the equestrian program at the 1996 Summer Olympics, was held from 29 July to 1 August 1996 at the Georgia International Horse Park, in Conyers, Georgia. Like all other equestrian events, the jumping competition was mixed gender, with both male and female athletes competing in the same division. There were 82 competitors from 24 nations. Each nation could have up to 4 riders. The event was won by Ulrich Kirchhoff of Germany, the nation's second consecutive victory in the individual jumping (and third overall, tying Italy for second-most all-time after France's four). It was the fourth consecutive Games at which Germany competed that the nation reached the podium in the event—gold in 1936 and bronze in 1952 (with no Games in 1940 or 1944, Germany disinvited in 1948, and either United Team of Germany or separate West Germany and East Germany teams competing from 1956 to 1988), before gold again in 1992 and 1996. The silver medal went to Wilhelm Melliger of Switzerland and the bronze to Alexandra Ledermann of France, the two of whom came out on top of a seven-way jump-off for second place.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nSeven of the top 10 riders from the 1992 Games returned: gold medalist Ludger Beerbaum of Germany, fourth-place finisher Hervé Godignon of France, fifth-place finisher (and 1988 seventh-place finisher) Jan Tops of the Netherlands, sixth-place finisher Maria Gretzer of Sweden, seventh-place finisher Ludo Philippaerts of Belgium, ninth-place finisher Rodrigo Pessoa of Brazil, and tenth-place finisher Michael Matz of the United States. The reigning World Champion was Franke Sloothaak of Germany.\nSaudi Arabia made its debut in the event. France competed for the 18th time, most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition underwent a smaller format change than in the two previous Games. The three-run qualifying and two-run final continued, though the number of finalists was reduced to 25 (from half the field) and there was no cut during the qualifying round or during the final round (only between qualifying and the final). The qualifying round also returned to the traditional fault scoring, rather than the positive points system used in 1988 and 1992.\nAll riders competed in the three runs of the qualifying round. The three-run total counted as the qualifying score. The top 25 riders advanced to the final, with a maximum of three riders per nation. The final consisted of two runs. The total of the two runs was used for the final score. A jump-off would be used if necessary to break ties for medal positions; other ties would not be broken.\nResults.\nTop 25 riders advanced to the final round, maximum of three riders per nation. Qualification round held 21 to 24 July. All scores were reset to zero after the third qualifying round. Final held 4 August 1996. 7 riders tied for second so an additional jump-off round was held.\nThe Argentine team was disqualified for animal cruelty during training."

        "text": "An English cricket team, under the auspices of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), toured Australia from October to December 1935 before going to New Zealand for a three-month tour. It played first-class matches against each of the five mainland state teams, and one match against an Australian XI.\nBackground.\nThe Bodyline tour of 1932-33 had caused such lingering ill-will in Australia that MCC decided to precede England's Test tour of Australia in 1936-37 with a non-Test tour in 1935-36 aimed at restoring good-will between the two cricketing nations. They chose the Surrey amateur Errol Holmes to captain the team, and instructed him to ensure the players' demeanour was \"cheerful and pleasant\" and that they would play the game \"in the proper spirit\". Each player was \"carefully selected, not only for his cricketing abilities but, equally, for his ambassadorial potentialities\".\nThe team.\nBob Wyatt was offered the captaincy but declined, saying he needed a rest. In order to limit the expense of the tour, only six professionals (Barber, Hardstaff, Langridge, Parks, Sims and Smith) were chosen, and there was no manager. The team was the youngest-ever English touring team, with an average age of 26. Holmes judged his team to be \"just about representative of England's second XI at the time\".\nThe tour.\nThe team arrived on 29 October and played the first match of the tour, a three-day game against Western Australia, beginning on 31 October. The match ended in a draw. The remaining Australian matches were all scheduled for four days.\nThe next match, against South Australia, was Don Bradman's first match for South Australia. He scored 15 and 50, falling lbw in each innings, and MCC won by 36 runs. The match against Victoria was drawn, and MCC then lost their only match of the tour by 10 wickets to New South Wales, captained by Alan McGilvray. MCC then beat Queensland by an innings, Human and Smith scoring MCC's first centuries of the tour.\nThe final match was against an Australian XI in Sydney beginning on 6 December. As the Australian Test team was touring South Africa, this match was effectively between the two national second elevens. MCC batted first and declared at 9 for 411, Hardstaff making 230 not out. The Australian XI made 227, and MCC declared again at 9 for 207. Needing 392 to win, the Australian XI were dismissed for 188, giving MCC victory by 203 runs.\nHardstaff was the leading batsman on the tour, with 634 runs at an average of 70.44. Sims was the leading wicket-taker, with 33 wickets at 25.27.\nIn assessing the tour, Holmes believed the team had \"carried out [its] mission\": \nNot a single member of the side had put a foot wrong, and our cricket had been more than adequate. I genuinely believe that we had contributed not a little towards healing the wounds which undoubtedly existed, in the cricket world, between Australia and ourselves before our arrival."

        "text": "M. A. Chidambaram Stadium (MAC), also known as the Chepauk Stadium or simply Chepauk due its location in the city's locality of Chepauk, is a sports ground in Chennai, India that has hosted international cricket matches along with provincial games. Named after M. A. Chidambaram, former President of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the venue was formerly known as the Madras Cricket Club ground. It has a capacity of 38,000 spectators for international matches. It is the home ground of the Tamil Nadu cricket team and the Indian Premier League team Chennai Super Kings. The first Test at this venue took place in 1934, between India and England. As of February 2021, it has hosted a further 33 Test matches. Chepauk has also staged 22 One Day International (ODI) matches, the first of which was in 1987 when Australia defeated India in a group-match during the 1987 World Cup.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The first bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a Test match at Chepauk was Amar Singh for India against England in 1934; he finished the innings with bowling figures of 7 wickets for 86 runs. Australia's Ashley Mallett became the first to take two five-wicket hauls in the same match at Chepauk, when he took 5 for 91 and 5 for 53 in the second and fourth innings of the fifth Test of Australia's 1969–70 tour of India. Narendra Hirwani is the most recent cricketer and the first Indian to take two five-wicket hauls on debut. He took 8 for 61 and 8 for 75 against the West Indies during the fourth Test of the 1987–88 series between the teams, which was held at this ground, and finished the match with bowling figures of 16 for 136. These are also the best match-figures by any bowler on Test debut. The best figures in Test cricket at Chepauk are 8 for 55, taken by India's Vinoo Mankad against England in 1952. Axar Patel took the most recent five-wicket haul at Chepauk, with figures of 5 for 60 against England in their 2020–21 tour of India. As of February 2021, 32 bowlers have taken 51 Test match five-wicket hauls at this ground.\nAs of November 2017, two bowlers have taken five-wicket hauls during ODIs at Chepauk. The first player to do so was Aaqib Javed of Pakistan, who achieved the feat when he took 5 wickets for 61 runs against India during the 1997 Pepsi Independence Cup. The other five-wicket haul was made by West Indies' Ravi Rampaul, which is also the best figures in ODI cricket at this ground. He took 5 for 51 against India during the 2011 World Cup. As of November 2017, a match between India and New Zealand is the only Twenty20 International (T20I) to be held at the ground, which New Zealand won by one run. The best bowling figures in T20I cricket at Chepauk are Irfan Pathan's 3 wickets for 31 runs."

His first few seasons hailed no significant progress, although he enjoyed victories over Bob Chaperon in the 1991 Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, and the veteran Rex Williams in qualifying for the 1994 World Championship.\nMcLellan reached his first quarter-final at Event 2 of the 1994 Minor Tour, where he defeated nineteen-year-old John Higgins 3–1, Drew Henry 3–0, Scott MacFarlane 3–1 and Robin Hull 5–2, before losing 3–5 to Jason Weston.\nThe following season at the 1996 International Open, he beat Jason Smith, Yasin Merchant, Steve Judd, Mark Johnston-Allen and Steve James, before losing 4–5 to compatriot Chris Small in the last 32. McLellan repeated this feat at the next year's edition of the tournament, defeated this time 5–0 by Peter Ebdon.\nAt the 1997 World Championship, McLellan won five matches to reach the main stages at the Crucible Theatre; he defeated Joe Jogia, Peter Lines and Tony Jones all 10–9, Nick Dyson 10–6 and Neal Foulds 10–9 to set up a meeting with the six-time World Champion Steve Davis in the last 32. In the event, Davis led 5–0, and prevailed 10–2.\nAfter this success, McLellan's form slipped, and he did not progress beyond the last 64 of a ranking tournament again. However, in a match against Steve Meakin at the 2000 Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, he compiled a 147 maximum break; McLellan beat Meakin 5–3 but lost in the last 64 to Sean Storey.\nHaving lost his professional status in 2001, McLellan entered tour qualifying events the following season to regain it; he was successful, but dropped off the tour once more at the end of the 2002/2003 season, leaving professional snooker at the age of 33."

Zimbabwe were going to play the two Tests in Bangladesh, before returning in January 2016 to complete the limited-overs fixtures.\nHowever, on 16 October 2015, the BCB announced that the Tests would be substituted for limited-overs matches.

        "title": "Bradley Jones (snooker player)",
        "text": "Bradley Jones (born 16 May 1974) is an English former professional snooker player.\nCareer.\nBorn in 1974, Jones turned professional in 1991. His first few years on the tour were low-key, but he reached the first semi-final of his career at Event 1 of the 1994 Strachan Challenge; there, he defeated Wayne Lloyd, John Giles, Darren Limbug, Billy Snaddon and Matt Wilson before losing 4–5 to Andy Hicks.\nThe following season, runs to the last 16 of the 1994 Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, where he lost 2–5 to the rising Rod Lawler, and the quarter-final of Event 5 of the 1995 Minor Tour, where twenty-year-old John Higgins defeated him 4–0, were highlights, although Jones' prize money from these exploits amounted only to £1,575.\nThe 1995/1996 season was very poor for Jones, and having earned nothing from ten tournaments, he dropped to 199th in the world rankings. However, he enjoyed a vast upturn in form from 1996; Jones reached the last 32 of the 1997 International Open, losing 1–5 to Paul Wykes, having earlier defeated the prominent Canadian Alain Robidoux 5–4, and also that year's Thailand Open, where the 1996 World finalist Peter Ebdon beat him 5–3. The highlight of this season was Jones' début appearance at the Crucible Theatre in the last 32 of the 1997 World Championship; he held John Parrott to 9–9, before losing the deciding frame by 44 points to 54.\nJones' performances in 1996/1997 had seen him rise 119 places in the rankings to 80th, and 1997/1998 saw more good form; having entered qualifying school to ensure he would keep his place on tour, Jones reached the last 32 of the 1997 UK Championship, losing 6–9 to Darren Morgan, and the last 48 of the 1998 Thailand Masters and that year's World Championship, meeting Jimmy White in both. In the former, he had led White 4–1 but lost 4–5, while the latter encounter resulted in a more comfortable 10–5 victory for White. Jones finished that season 44th in the world rankings, a rise of 155 places over two seasons.\nIn the 1998/1999 season, Jones was defeated 2–5 by Ken Doherty in the last 16 of the 1998 Irish Open, and 3–5 by James Wattana in the last 32 of the 1998 Thailand Masters, Wattana's home event. Several more last-32 runs ensured that Jones would finish the season in the highest position of his career, 33rd in the world.\nNow an established top-64 player, Jones reached the quarter-final of the 2000 Welsh Open, defeating Jamie Burnett, Jimmy Michie and Drew Henry before losing 1–5 to Higgins, who would go on to win the tournament.\nThe highlight of season 2000/2001 for Jones was a run to the last 16 of the 2000 China Open; there, he lost 3–5 to Henry.\nAfter reaching the last 32 of the 2002 Scottish Open, where he lost to Dave Harold, Jones' form declined sharply once more. He failed to progress beyond the last 64 of another ranking event and, ranked 104th at the end of the 2003/2004 season, lost his professional status immediately thereafter at the age of 30.\nJones' attempts to requalify the following season were in vain. He won three matches to set up an encounter against seventeen-year-old Judd Trump in qualifying for the 2007 World Championship; Trump made two century breaks in defeating Jones 10–8 and would make his début at the Crucible later that year, but Jones did not play professionally again.\nIn 2016, Jones won several matches at Q-School, in another attempt to regain his professional status; in Event 1, he lost 1–4 in the last 64 to Lyu Chenwei, and at the last-32 stage in Event 2, Adam Duffy defeated him 4–3. In light of his high finishing place on the Q-School order of merit - a rankings list based on performances at both events - Jones was invited to participate in several ranking events during the 2016/2017 season.\nAt the Riga Masters, in his first-round match, he led Morgan - by now also playing as an amateur - 3–1, but could not prevent a 3–4 loss; similar form followed in the 2016 European Masters, where David John whitewashed him 4–0.\nAfter losing 0–6 to Jimmy Robertson in the International Championship in September 2016, Jones did not play in a tournament until the 2017 Snooker Shoot-Out, five months later; he beat Sanderson Lam 80–7 in the first round - his first win in a ranking event since 2007 - but was eliminated at the last-64 stage, 27–34 by Darryl Hill."

They found major success in women's gymnastics starting in 1976. At that year's Olympics, Nadia Comăneci made history, leading Romania to the team silver medal, winning the individual all-around gold medal, and becoming the first woman to score a perfect 10. She scored seven 10s during the Games and subsequently became the most famous gymnast in the world. Romania built on that and for years was the second-best country in women's gymnastics, after the Soviet Union. With Comăneci, they also won the gold medal at the 1979 World Championships and the silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics.\nIn the mid to late-1980s, the team was led by future Hall of Famers Ecaterina Szabo and Daniela Silivaș. They won gold at the 1984 Olympics and silver at the 1988 Olympics. Romania then had their greatest period of success in the 1990s. The team featured three Hall of Famers during that decade: Lavinia Miloșovici, Gina Gogean, and Simona Amânar. They won silver at the 1992 Olympics, bronze at the 1996 Olympics, and gold at the 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1999 World Championships. In 2000, they won their second Olympic team gold medal, and Amânar won the individual all-around title.\nRomania continued their success into the 2000s and won another Olympic gold in 2004. However, since then, they have not finished higher than third at the Olympics or Worlds. Their run as one of the sport's top countries ended when they did not qualify for the 2016 Olympics team competition.\nOverview.\nAt the Olympic Games, Romania has competed in the women's artistic gymnastics team competition 15 times. The team has won 12 medals, including gold medals in 1984, 2000, and 2004. Romania has also won the women's team competition seven times at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nMost decorated gymnasts.\nThis list includes all Romanian female artistic gymnasts who have won at least four medals at the Olympic Games and the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships combined.\nHall of Famers.\nNine national team gymnasts and two national team coaches have been inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame:"

        "title": "Lauberhorn ski races",
        "text": "The Lauberhorn ski races (Lauberhorn World Cup alpine ski races () (downhill, slalom, and combined) are among the highest-attended winter sports events in the world, attracting around 30,000 spectators each year. An established attraction is the airshow by the Patrouille Suisse, the aerobatic demonstration team of the Swiss Air Force. The 2016 races were held 15–17 January (super-combined, downhill, and slalom).\nThe races in Wengen in the Bernese Oberland are held in mid-January, usually the week prior to the Hahnenkamm, in Kitzbühel, Austria, another classic downhill race run since the early 1930s.\nThe Lauberhorn is a mountain in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland, located between Wengen and Grindelwald, north of the Kleine Scheidegg. Its summit is at an elevation of above sea level.\nThe downhill course is the longest in the world; its length of over results in run times of two and a half minutes (about 30–45 seconds longer than standard downhill races); top speeds approach on its \"Haneggschuss\", the highest speeds on the World Cup circuit.\nThe Lauberhorn downhill run is surrounded by the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau above the Lauterbrunnen valley. It is known for run arrangements such as the \"Hundschopf\", a signature jump over a rock nose, the \"Kernen-S\" (passing over a bridge at around and the \"Wasserstation\" tunnel (underpassing the viaduct of the Wengernalpbahn).\nRaces are held on two famous courses \"Lauberhorn\" (downhill) and \"Männlichen / Jungfrau\" (slalom).\nKey sections.\nMany of the named portions of the course are due to historic falls or crashes by racers. The best known sections of the Lauberhorn downhill, or \"Lauberhornrennen\", race are the following (in descending order):\nHistory.\nOne of the first reports of skiing from the Lauberhorn to Wengen was in 1912 when the Roberts of Candahar Ski Challenge Cup was offered. By 1927 it was just known as the Lauberhorn Ski Cup.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously-held ski races. The \"Russisprung\" was originally built in the spring for a television show and was incorporated into the course by organizers the following year. The \"Minsch-Kante\" is where Josef Minsch fell in 1965 and was hospitalized for weeks. The \"Canadian Corner\" is named after two of the Crazy Canucks, Dave Irwin and Ken Read, who aggressively attacked this part of the course in 1976 and subsequently fell during the race. The \"Kernen-S\" was renamed for 2003 winner Bruno Kernen after his crash in 2006 at the former \"Brüggli-S\". The \"Silberhornsprung\" was introduced in 2003 with the pyramid-shaped Silberhorn mountain in the background for television viewers. The \"Österreicherloch\" (Austrian hole) got its name in 1954 when almost all participating Austrian skiers (including Toni Sailer) fell there; 1960s Austrian great Karl Schranz later fell there as well.\nIn 1991, a tragic death occurred during training for the race at the \"Ziel-S\" (Finish-S). The young Austrian skier Gernot Reinstadler was not able to finish the S-curve properly and therefore jumped into the slope boundary (because he was too far to the right), where he hooked one ski in the security net and suffered severe injuries to the lower body. He died shortly after the accident from internal bleeding. The race was not held that year. In reaction to this tragic event, the slope boundary at that place was also equipped with rejection canvas and the gates were moved upwards and more to the left.\nSnowmaking was added in the mid-1990s, and the combined race has been a run as a \"super combined\" since the World Cup debut of the format at Wengen in 2005. The \"super-combi\" consists of a shortened downhill and with a slalom run, both on the same day, instead of three runs (one downhill and two slalom) of the traditional combined. On the World Cup circuit, the traditional combined is usually not run as separate races, but determined \"on paper\" from the results of the primary downhill and slalom races, which are run on separate days. (The Olympics and world championships are the exceptions, holding separate races for the combined.) At the Winter Olympics, the super-combined format replaced the traditional combined at the 2010 Winter Games."

        "text": "The marathon at the World Championships in Athletics has been contested by both men and women since the inaugural edition in 1983. It is the second most prestigious global title in the discipline after the marathon at the Olympics. From 1997 to 2011 it hosted the World Marathon Cup team event. It currently forms part of the World Marathon Majors circuit, which includes the six top annual races. The competition format has separate men's and women's races, which both serve as a straight final. Participation typically numbers between sixty and eighty runners per race. The event usually starts and ends in the main stadium, with the rest of the race taking place on the surrounding roads of the host city.\nThe championship records for the event are 2:06:54 hours for men, set by Abel Kirui in 2009, and 2:20:57 hours for women, set by Paula Radcliffe in 2005. The world record has never been broken or equalled at the competition by either men or women, reflecting the lack of pacemaking and athletes' more tactical approach to championship races.\nCatherine Ndereba and Edna Kiplagat are the most successful athletes of the event, having each won two gold medals and one silver medal in the women's marathon. In addition, Kiplagat finished top five in five consecutive World Athletics Championship Marathons from 2011-2019. Three other athletes have won the World Championships marathon twice: Abel Antón, Jaouad Gharib, and Abel Kirui – all of whom along with Edna Kiplagat had back-to-back victories.\nKenya is the most successful nation in the discipline, having won eight gold medals overall (four in each division). Japan is the next most successful, with three gold medallists, and shares the highest medal total of fourteen with Kenya. Spain has won three gold medals, while Ethiopia has won ten medals in the men's race (the highest).\nAge.\nPatrick Dupouy of French Polynesia became the oldest male competitor of World Championships history in 2007, at the age of 46 years and 85 days. Under current regulations, the records for the youngest participants will remain indefinitely as any athlete in the junior category (under-20) that year, or younger, is ineligible to enter the marathon.\nDoping.\nThe first doping ban to effect the World Championships marathon came in 2001, when Italy's Roberto Barbi (60th in the men's race) was disqualified. Original eighth-placer Nailiya Yulamanova was disqualified from the 2009 women's race and another Russian, Mikhail Lemayev, had his result annulled from the men's race that year. Biological passport irregularities saw Abderrahim Goumri's runs in 2009 and 2011 retrospectively annulled. The anti-doping programme at the 2013 championships saw Jeremías Saloj disqualified from the men's race for doping."

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Stuart Broad",
        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only 48 bowlers have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls at the international level. Stuart Broada right-arm fast-medium bowleris a former Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricketer who represented England. Broad has taken 604 wickets in Test matches, 178 wickets in ODIs and 65 wickets in T20Is. , Broad has 21 five-wicket hauls across all formats in his international career and ranks twenty-eighth in the all-time list, and fourth in the equivalent list for England.\nBroad made his Test debut against Sri Lanka during England's tour in 2007 with bowling figures of one wicket for 77 runs. His first five-wicket haul came against the West Indies during the first Test of the 2008–09 series at Sabina Park, taking five wickets for 85 runs in the first innings. His best bowling figures are eight wickets for 15 runs which he took in the first innings of the fourth and decisive Test of the 2015 Ashes series at Trent Bridge. Securing the five wickets in 19 deliveries, Broad equalled the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history, set in 1947 by Ernie Toshack for Australia against India, and recorded the best Test bowling figures ever at Trent Bridge, surpassing Muttiah Muralitharan's eight for 70 against England in June 2006. Broad has been most successful against Australia, taking eight Test five-wicket hauls.\nBroad made his ODI debut against Pakistan during the latter's tour of England and Scotland in 2006. He took the only wicket of the second innings, that of Shoaib Malik, in a rain-curtailed match. His only five-wicket haul in the ODI format came against South Africa in 2008. Broad took five wickets for 23 runs in the match, which England won by 10 wickets. The performance earned him the man-of-the-match award. Broad made his first T20I appearance in 2008 and is yet to take a five-wicket haul in the format . His figures of four wickets for 24 runs against New Zealand in Auckland in 2013 remain his best in this variant of the game."

        "title": "Bettinardi Golf",
        "text": "Bettinardi Golf is an American sports equipment company that produces a wide range of golf equipment and clothing. Bettinardi was founded in 1998 by Robert J. Bettinardi, \nSome of the products manufactured and marketed include putters, wedges, and accessories (tees, headcovers, grips, bags). Bettinardi also markets a clothing line that includes t-shirts, polo shirts, and belts.\nHistory.\nRobert Bettinardi started his work in the putting industry in 1991 when he saw an advertisement from Callaway in a golf shop for a putter milled on a Bridgeport milling machine. At the time, Bettinardi owned his own manufacturing facility with CNC (computer numerical control) machines that did work for hydraulic companies and the communications industries. Bettinardi called Callaway and was put in touch with the company's then designer. Bettinardi was able to pick up work from this particular designer and make all of his putters from 1991 to 1993. At the time, putting technology entailed milling the head and the neck of the putter separately, then welding the neck on to the head. It was during this time that Bettinardi created the first ever one-piece milled putter out of a solid block of steel.\nOther designers in the golf industry noticed Bettinardi's work which led to Robert making putters for Scotty Cameron from 1993 to 1998. All Titleist putters during this timeframe were milled by Robert in his own manufacturing facility and finished in California. During this time frame, Bettinardi was the go-to for milled putters from all of the other top original equipment manufacturers in the industry.\nIn 1998, Robert set out on his own to create his own brand, Bettinardi Golf.\nBettinardi Golf saw immediate success with victories on tour within the first few years of the company's founding. The uniqueness came from the patented Honeycomb milling pattern that Bettinardi created using a jewelers bit to create a perfectly flat face.\nFrom 2003 to 2005, Bettinardi aligned with the Ben Hogan Golf company, producing putters for them as \"Hogan Milled By Bettinardi\". The most notable victory during this period came from Jim Furyk at the 2003 US Open played at Olympia Fields CC.\nBettinardi left Hogan after Spalding, who owned Ben Hogan at the time was purchased by Callaway Golf.\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Bettinardi partnered with Mizuno Golf, and again made products under the Mizuno brand named \"Mizuno by Bettinardi\". This partnership lasted three years and at the end of the agreement Bettinardi decided to branch out on his own again.\nSince the partnership ended, Bettinardi Golf has earned 10 victories on the PGA Tour, and 3 on the Champions Tour. Most notably and presently, Matt Kuchar, Fred Couples, Jim Herman, Brian Gay, Edoardo Molinari, and Steven Bowditch use their putters.\nIn 2018, at the request of the Philadelphia Eagles, the company produced a limited edition Bettinardi BB1 blade putter featuring engravings honoring the team's first Super Bowl title with the date and 41-33 final score on the bumpers.\nSponsorships.\nGolfers that won tournaments using Bettinardi equipment were:"

It was the 40th year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the venue. The event was tenth and last event that carries ranking points of the 2015–16 snooker season.\nStuart Bingham was the defending champion, having defeated Shaun Murphy in the 2015 event final. Bingham lost 9–10 against Ali Carter in the first round, falling to the Crucible curse and becoming the 17th first-time champion unable to defend his title at the venue. Alan McManus and Ding Junhui set a record in their semi-final for the most century breaks achieved in a professional match, scoring ten. Ding also set a record for the most centuries by one player in a single World Championship match with seven. Ding defeated McManus to become the first Asian player to reach a World Championship final. In the other semi-final, Englishman Mark Selby and Hongkonger Marco Fu set a record for the longest of snooker ever played at the Crucible, at 76 minutes 11 seconds.\nAfter beating Robert Milkins 10–6, Sam Baird 13–11, Kyren Wilson 13–8, and Fu 17–15, Selby defeated Ding 18–14 in the final to claim his second World title, having won the 2014 event previously. A total of 86 century breaks were made at the event, the same number as the previous year; Kyren Wilson made the tournament's highest break of 143. The global audiences for the tournament exceeded 300 million, 210 million viewers in China alone. The afternoon sessions of the final were watched by audiences of 45 million in China, the country's largest audience for a sporting event that year. During the tournament, six-time champion Steve Davis played the last professional match of his 38-year career against Fergal O'Brien in the qualifier and announced his retirement during the first round of the event.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and is the official professional world championship of the game of snooker. The sport of snooker was founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India.\nThe world championship sees 32 professional players compete in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several . The 32 players for the event are selected through a mix of the world snooker rankings and pre-tournament qualification rounds. The first world championship was held in 1927 at Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England, and was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.\n, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O’Sullivan are the event's most successful participants in the modern era, having both won the championship seven times. The previous year's championship had been won by England's Stuart Bingham, who defeated Shaun Murphy in the final 18–15. This was Bingham's first championship win. The winner of the 2016 event earned prize money of £330,000, from a total pool of £1.5 million. The event was the tenth and last ranking event of the 2015–2016 season.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize money of the event was raised to £1,500,100 from £1,364,000 the previous year. The breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nThe prize for a maximum break stood at £20,000.\nTournament summary.\nSeeding and qualifying rounds.\nThe top 16 seeds automatically qualified for the first round. Defending champion Bingham was seeded first, and other seeded places were allocated based on the latest world rankings. Professional players below 17th place in rankings, and 16 invited amateur players started in the first round of qualifying, and were required to win three best-of-19-frame matches to reach the Crucible. Qualifying rounds were held at the Ponds Forge International Sports Centre in Sheffield from 6 to 13 April 2016.\nEleven former world champions competed in the tournament. Six-time champion Davis lost 4–10 to Fergal O'Brien in the first round of qualifying, and subsequently announced his retirement from the sport after 38 years as a professional. The 1997 champion Ken Doherty lost 6–10 to Ryan Day in the final round of qualifying. Former world number one Ding Junhui was no longer in the top 16 ranked players before the tournament, and had to qualify to the Crucible. He did that with the loss of only seven frames, defeating Greg Casey 10–4, Ross Muir 10–1, and the 1995 runner-up Nigel Bond 10–2.\nThepchaiya Un-Nooh missed the final in attempting a maximum break against Anthony McGill in the fourth frame of their final qualifying round match. Un-Nooh had also missed the last black in attempting a maximum break earlier in the season, in a match against Neil Robertson in the 2015 UK Championship. Hong Kong's Ng On-yee attempted to become the first woman ever to reach the main stage of the event; she lost 1–10 against Peter Lines in the first round of qualifying.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 16 and 21 April as best-of-19-frame matches. Mitchell Mann was the only player making his Crucible debut. He lost 3–10 in the first round to Mark Allen. Steve Davis announced his retirement on live television during the tournament's first weekend, before play began on the first Sunday afternoon.\nPlaying the defending champion Bingham, Ali Carter led 5–1 and 8–5 before Bingham won four consecutive frames to lead 9–8. Carter tied the match with a century break in the 18th frame, before taking the to win 10–9. The loss made Bingham the 17th player to succumb to the Crucible curse, as no first time defending champion won the event the following season. Shaun Murphy, the previous year's runner-up, also received a first-round exit when he lost 8–10 to McGill. This was the first time since the 1980 championship that both of the previous year's finalists lost the first matches they played upon their return.\nStephen Maguire lost 7–10 to Alan McManus in his fourth consecutive first-round defeat at the Crucible. As a result, Maguire was guaranteed to be outside of the world's top 16 at the end of the tournament. After his 10–7 victory over David Gilbert, Ronnie O'Sullivan refused to attend a post-match meeting with the press or talk to tournament broadcasters, and received a formal warning from World Snooker. Following losses by Ebdon and Dott, Robertson became the fifth former champion to exit in the first round when Michael Holt defeated him 10–6. This meant that O'Sullivan, Selby, Williams, and Higgins were the only former winners to reach the second round.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played between 21 and 25 April as best-of-25-frames, over three sessions. McManus won 13–11 over Carter, who had defeated him 10–5 in the first round in 2015. Ding Junhui won 13–10 over Judd Trump, who had defeated him 13–4 in the previous year's quarter-finals. Carter was strongly critical of the table on which he played McManus, calling it \"the worst I have ever played on.\" Tournament organisers later changed the cloth and cushions used on the tables.\nKyren Wilson led at both 7–0 and then 11–5 over Allen before Allen won four straight frames to trail 11–9, but Wilson won the next two to win the match 13–9 and advance to his first World Championship quarter-final. Mark Selby led Sam Baird 11–7 before Baird won four consecutive frames to level at 11–11. Selby then won the next two frames to win 13–11. Four-time champion John Higgins beat Ricky Walden 13–8, and two-time champion Mark Williams defeated Michael Holt, also 13–8, to get past the second round for only the second time since 2006. Marco Fu defeated Anthony McGill 13–9 to reach his first quarter-final in a decade.\nTrailing Barry Hawkins 9–12, Ronnie O'Sullivan won three consecutive frames to take the match to a deciding frame. Hawkins prevailed in the decider to win the match 13–12, the first time in 14 years that he had beaten O'Sullivan in a competitive match. This was also only the second time in 13 years that O'Sullivan had failed to reach the quarter-finals. Despite losing, O'Sullivan made four century breaks and eight more breaks over 50, scoring 1,409 points to Hawkins's 1,135.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played between 26 and 27 April as best-of-25-frames, over three sessions. Ding's 13–3 victory over Mark Williams saw him win the match with a session to spare to reach his second Crucible semi-final, after his first appearance in 2011. After going 6–0 ahead, Mark Selby defeated Kyren Wilson 13–8. Wilson made a 143 break in the 20th frame, the highest of the tournament.\nAlan McManus came from 9–11 behind against John Higgins to win 13–11 and reach his first Crucible semi-final since 1993. At the age of 45, he became the oldest Crucible semi-finalist since Ray Reardon, who was 52 when he reached that stage in 1985. Marco Fu led Hawkins by 9–1 before Hawkins won five straight frames. Fu won 13–11 to reach his second Crucible semi-final, a decade after his first in 2006.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played from 28 to 30 April over four sessions as best-of-33-frame matches. In the first, Ding was leading McManus 5–0 and 9–3, scoring five centuries in nine frames. McManus won six consecutive frames to trail 8–9. Ding increased his lead to 12–8, and won 17–11 to reach his first World Championship final. In frame 20, Ding attempted a maximum break, but missed the 15th black for a break of 113, his sixth century. In the 27th frame, Ding made his seventh century to set a new record for the most centuries made by a player in a World Championship match. The record surpassed the previous record of six centuries set by Davis in 1946, Mark Selby in 2011, and Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2013. Ding's seven centuries equalled the record for the most by one player in any professional snooker match, set by Hendry in the 1994 UK Championship final. In total, 10 centuries were made in the match, which was a record in professional play.\nIn the opening session of the other semi-final, Mark Selby took a 3–0 and 5–3 lead, before Marco Fu ended the second session all-square at 8–8. Fu's cue tip separated from his cue in the 15th frame as he was chalking it. A ten-minute break was called while the tip was glued back on. Frame 24, won by Selby to level at 12–12, lasted 76 minutes 11 seconds. This was the longest frame ever played at the Crucible, breaking the previous record of 74 minutes 58 seconds set in the 2009 match between Maguire and Mark King. The match was later tied at 15–15 until Selby won the final two frames to win the match 17–15. Frame 32 also lasted more than an hour.\nFinal.\nThe final was played 1–2 May, held as best-of-35-frames, over four sessions. Ding was the first qualifier to play the World final since Trump was beaten by John Higgins in 2011. Ding also became the first Asian finalist in the championships.\nIn the first session of the final, Mark Selby took a 6–0 lead, before Ding won the last two frames of the session to leave Selby 6–2 ahead. Ding won five of the next seven frames to trail by only one frame at 7–8, but Selby won the final two frames of the day for a 10–7 overnight lead. Some frames in the second session were lengthy, and play did not end at the Crucible until 00:24 local time on Monday morning.\nOn the second day of the final, Ding again fought back to trailing by only one frame at 10–11; Selby won three of the session's last four frames to go into the final session 14–11 ahead. Selby won the next two frames to need only two more frames for victory. Ding won three more frames in the evening session – coming from 16 to 11 behind to 16–14. Selby clinched the match by 18 frames to 14 to claim his second world title, along with the £330,000 prize. The match ended just minutes after Selby's home city of Leicester celebrated Leicester City F.C.'s first ever Premier League title win. The afternoon session of the final was watched by 45 million people in China, the country's largest audience for a sporting event that year. The event as a whole attracted 300 million viewers in China, including 210 million on CCTV-5.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round.

        "text": "Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level. A Test match is scheduled to take place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nZimbabwe played their first test match in 1992, becoming the ninth test nation. Since then, they have played 113 test matches, compiling a record of 13 wins, 25 draws, and 75 defeats. As of March 2023, Zimbabwe's win percentage of 9% is the second-lowest of any test nation to have played at least ten matches, ahead of Bangladesh, and lower overall than any other nation except Ireland. Despite being a test nation since 1992, they accepted a voluntary suspension from test cricket in 2005, and did not play test cricket again until 2011.\nThis is a list of Zimbabwe Test cricket records. It is based on the List of Test cricket records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with Zimbabwean Test cricket team, and any cricketers who have played for that team.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for Zimbabwe only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nTeam wins, losses, draws and ties.\n, Zimbabwe played 115 Test matches resulting in 13 victories, 74 defeats and 28 draws for an overall winning percentage of 11.30.\nIndividual records.\nBatting records.\nMost triple centuries.\nNo Zimbabwe batsmen has scored a triple century yet in Test cricket.\nAll-round Records.\n1000 runs and 100 wickets.\nA total of 71 players have achieved the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in their Test career.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed."
