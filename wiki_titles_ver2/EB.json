        "text": "In basketball, a steal is the act of legally gaining possession of the ball by a defensive player who causes the opponent to turn the ball over. The steal statistic was first compiled by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) during the 1985–86 season. All of the players on this list have recorded 11 or more steals in a single game in NCAA Division I competition.\nThe all-time single game steals record holder is Daron \"Mookie\" Blaylock of Oklahoma, who twice recorded 13 steals. The first instance occurred on December 12, 1987 against Centenary, while the second instance happened nearly one year later to the day on December 17, 1988 against Loyola Marymount. Blaylock and Darron Brittman of Chicago State are the only two Division I players who have recorded at least 11 steals on two occasions. Chris Thomas of Notre Dame, meanwhile, is the only freshman to achieve the feat."

        "title": "2010 Rafael Nadal tennis season",
        "text": "The 2010 Rafael Nadal tennis season is lauded as one of the greatest seasons of all time. Nadal himself also called it his best year. In the 2010 season, Nadal became the first male player in tennis history to win Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard court) in the same year, referred to as a Surface Slam. He became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the French-Wimbledon-US triplet in a calendar year, being the fourth in history. At 24 years, 3 months and 10 days, after his win at the US Open, he simultaneously became the youngest player in the Open Era to complete both (in singles) the Career Grand Slam, and the Career Golden Slam. With this achievement, he was only the second man in history to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles, after Andre Agassi did so in 1996. He also became the second man to win at least two majors on three different surfaces in his career (Double Career Surface Slam). Nadal further cemented his place in history by becoming the first, and only player to-date, to win Monte-Carlo Masters, Madrid Masters, Rome Masters, and the French Open in a calendar year, a feat known as the Clay Slam.\nYear summary.\nCapital World Tennis Championship.\nNadal began the year by participating in the Capitala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. He defeated compatriot David Ferrer (7-6(3), 6-3) to reach his second final in the exhibition tournament. In the final, Nadal defeated Robin Söderling (7-6(3), 7-5).\nQatar ExxonMobil Open.\nSecondly, Nadal participated in the Australian Open warm-up tournament, the Qatar ExxonMobil Open ATP 250 event in Doha, where he lost in the final. He defeated the Italians Simone Bolelli in the first round (6-3, 6-3) and Potito Starace (6-2, 6-2) in the second round. In the quarter-finals, the Spaniard defeated the Belgian Steve Darcis: 6-1, 2-0(ret). After that, in the semi-final, Nadal defeated the fifth seed Viktor Troicki (6-1, 6-3), winning eleven games in a row. In the final, Nadal lost to Russian Nikolay Davydenko (6-0, 6-7(8), 4-6), despite dominating the opening set and holding two match points in the second set. Davydenko had also defeated Roger Federer in the semi-final before facing Nadal in the final.\nAustralian Open.\nIn the first round of the Australian Open, Nadal defeated the Australian Peter Luczak (7-6(0), 6-1, 6-4). In the second round, he beat Lukáš Lacko (6-2, 6-2, 6-2). In the third round, he was tested by Philipp Kohlschreiber, finally beating him in four sets (6-4, 6-2, 2-6, 7-5). In the fourth round, he beat the Croatian Ivo Karlović, (6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4). In the quarter-finals, Nadal pulled out in the third set against Andy Murray, having lost the first two sets (6-3, 7-6(2)). After having his knee examined, doctors told Nadal to take two weeks of rest followed by two weeks of rehabilitation.\nIn singles, Nadal reached the semi-finals at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells as the current defending champion. However, the eventual winner, Ivan Ljubičić, defeated him in three sets. He and López won the doubles title by defeating the number one seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić. This boosted Nadal's doubles ranking 175 places, going from number 241 to being number 66 in the world. After Indian Wells, Nadal reached the semi-finals of Sony Ericsson Open where he lost to the eventual champion Andy Roddick in three sets.\nMonte Carlo Rolex Masters.\nNadal reached the final of the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters in Monaco after beating the fellow Spaniard David Ferrer (6-3, 6-2) in the semi-finals. This was Nadal's first tour final since Doha earlier that year. He won the final with a (6-0, 6-1) score over his compatriot Fernando Verdasco. He lost fourteen games throughout all five matches, the fewest he had ever lost en route to a championship, and the tournament's final was the shortest Masters 1000 final in terms of games. With this win, Nadal became the first player in open history to win a tournament title for six straight years.\nUnlike previous years, Nadal chose to skip the Barcelona tournament despite the fact that he was the five-time defending champion.\nInternazional BNL d'Italia.\nHis next tournament was the 2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia. He defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber, Victor Hănescu, and Stanislas Wawrinka all in straight sets to win his 57th straight match, in April. In the semi-finals, he faced a resilient Ernests Gulbis, who defeated Roger Federer earlier in the tournament and battled Nadal into a three-set-match for the first time in this clay court season. Nadal eventually prevailed with a (6-4, 3-6, 6-4) in two hours and forty minutes. Then he defeated compatriot David Ferrer in the final (7-5, 6-2) for his fifth title at Rome, to equal Andre Agassi's record of winning 17 ATP Masters 1000 titles.\nMadrid Open.\nNadal then entered the 2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open, where he had finished runner-up the previous year. By being one of the top eight seeds, he received a bye in the first round. In the second round, he defeated the qualifier Oleksandr Dolgopolov, Jr. in straight sets. He then played the six-foot-nine American John Isner, and Nadal comfortably came through in straight sets, (7-5, 6-4). In the quarter-finals, he defeated Gaël Monfils (6-1, 6-3) and then his countryman Nicolás Almagro, who was playing the first Masters 1000 semifinal of his career, (4-6, 6-2, 6-2). The first set of his match against Almagro would be just the second set he lost on clay courts up to this point in 2010. Nadal then defeated his longtime rival Roger Federer (6-4, 7-6(5)), avenging his 2009 final loss to Federer. The win gave him his 18th Masters 1000 title, breaking the all-time record. He became the first player to win all three clay court Masters 1000 titles in a single year and the first player to win three consecutive Masters events. Nadal moved back to No. 2 in the rankings the following day.\nFrench Open.\nEntering the French Open, many were expecting another Nadal-Federer final. However, this became impossible when rival Robin Söderling defeated Federer (3-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4) in the quarter-finals. The failure of Federer to reach the semi-finals would allow Nadal to regain the world number 1 ranking, if he were to win the tournament. Nadal advanced to the final and defeated Soderling (6-4, 6-2, 6-4) to win the French Open. The win gave Nadal his seventh Grand Slam, tying him with John McEnroe, John Newcombe and Mats Wilander on the all-time list, and allowed Nadal to reclaim the position of ATP World Number One; denying his biggest rival Roger Federer the all-time record for weeks at No. 1. With this win, Nadal became the first man to win the three Masters series on clay and the French Open; this was dubbed by the media as the \"Clay Slam\". This victory at Roland Garros marked the second time that Nadal had won the French Open without dropping a single set (tying the record held by Björn Borg). With the win in Paris he also booked his place at the World Tour Finals in London, and became the first player to win five French Open titles in six years.\nAs of 2017, Nadal's clay season was the second most successful in his career, as he earned 5,000 points after winning 4 titles. This was only surpassed by his 2013 season, in which Nadal earned 5,100 points after winning Barcelona, Madrid, Rome and the French Open, and being runner-up in Monte-Carlo.\nAegon Championships.\nIn June, Nadal entered the Aegon Championships—which he won in 2008—at the prestigious Queen's Club. He played singles and doubles at this grass court tournament as a warm up for the Wimbledon Championships. By being one of the top eight seeds, he received a bye in the first round. In the second round, where he played his first match on grass since winning Wimbledon in 2008, he defeated the Brazilian Marcos Daniel easily in two sets, (6-2, 6-2). In the third round, he played Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan, whom he defeated (7-6(4), 4-6, 6-4), to advance to the quarter-finals. However, in the quarter-finals he was defeated by his compatriot Feliciano López (6-7(5), 4-6), and left the competition without a title.\nWimbledon.\nAt the 2010 Wimbledon Championships Nadal started by beating Kei Nishikori (6-2, 6-4, 6-4) in the first round. In the second round, he fought hard and succeeded against Robin Haase after five sets (5-7, 6-2, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3). In the third round, he defeated Philipp Petzschner. The match was a 5-set thriller with Nadal triumphing (6-4, 4-6, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3). During this match, Nadal was warned twice for receiving coaching from his coach and uncle, Toni Nadal, resulting in a $2,000 fine by Wimbledon officials. Allegedly, encouraging words for Nadal shouted during the match were some sort of coaching code signal. After that, Nadal comfortably beat the French Paul-Henri Mathieu in three sets (6-4, 6-2, 6-2). In the quarter-finals, he got past the Swedish Robin Söderling in four sets (3-6, 6-3, 7-6(7-4), 6-1). He then defeated Andy Murray in straight sets (6-4, 7-6(8-6), 6-4) to reach his fourth Wimbledon final.\nIn the 2010 Wimbledon men's title, Nadal won the tournament by defeating Tomáš Berdych in straight sets (6-3, 7-5, 6-4). After the win, Rafa said, \"It is more than a dream for me\" and thanked the crowd for being both kind and supportive to him during this match and also in the semi-final against Andy Murray. The win gave him a second Wimbledon title and an eighth career major title, at the age of 24.\nRogers Cup.\nIn his first hard-court tournament since Miami, Nadal advanced to the semi-finals of the Rogers Cup, along with No. 2 Novak Djokovic, No. 3 Roger Federer, and No. 4 Andy Murray, after coming back from a one-set deficit to defeat the German Philipp Kohlschreiber (3-6, 6-3, 6-4). In the semifinal, defending champion Andy Murray defeated Nadal (6-3, 6-4), becoming the only player to triumph over the Spaniard twice in 2010. Nadal also competed in the doubles tournament with Novak Djokovic in a one-time, high-profile partnership, not seen since 1976 when Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe as World No.1 and No.2 paired up, making a double dream team. However, they lost in the first round to Canadians Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil.\nThe next week, Nadal was the top seed at the Cincinnati Masters, losing in the quarter-finals to 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis.\nUS Open.\nAt the 2010 US Open, Nadal was the top seed for the second time in three years. He defeated Teymuraz Gabashvili, Denis Istomin, Gilles Simon, 23rd seed Feliciano López, 8th seed Fernando Verdasco, and 12th seed Mikhail Youzhny, all without dropping a set, to reach his first US Open final. By doing that he became the 8th man in the Open Era to reach the final of all four majors at the age 24; the second youngest to ever do so, behind only Jim Courier. In the final, he defeated 3rd seed Novak Djokovic (6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2), which completed the Career Grand Slam for Nadal, and he became the second male after Andre Agassi to complete a Career Golden Slam. Nadal also became the first man to win Grand Slams on clay, grass, and hard court surfaces in the same year (later accomplished by Djokovic in 2021 after winning the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon Championships), and the first to win the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open in the same year since Rod Laver in 1969. With the US Open win, Nadal became, along with Mats Wilander, the only male players to win at least two Grand Slams each on clay, grass, and hard court in their careers (Novak Djokovic later completed this feat with his second French Open title in 2021). After all that, he also became the first left-handed man to win the US Open since John McEnroe in 1984. This victory also clinched the year-end number one ranking for 2010, making Nadal the third player (after Ivan Lendl in 1989 and Roger Federer in 2009) to regain the year-end number one ranking after having lost it.\nThailand Open.\nNadal began his Asian tour at 2010 PTT Thailand Open in Bangkok, where he reached the semi-finals, losing to his compatriot Guillermo García-López.\nJapan Open.\nHe was able to regroup, and at the 2010 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo (debut), he defeated Santiago Giraldo, Milos Raonic and Dmitry Tursunov. In the semi-finals against Viktor Troicki, Nadal saved two match points in the deciding-set tiebreaker, to win it 9-7 in the end. In the final, Nadal comfortably defeated Gaël Monfils (6-1, 7-5) for his 7th title of the season.\nShanghai Rolex Masters.\nNadal next played in the 2010 Shanghai Rolex Masters, in Shanghai, where he was the top seed, but lost to world's number twelve, Jürgen Melzer in the third round, stopping his record streak of 21 consecutive Masters quarter-finals. On 5 November, Nadal announced that he was pulling out of the Paris Masters due to tendinitis in his left shoulder.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nAt the ATP World Tour Finals in London, Nadal defeated Andy Roddick (3-6, 7-6(5), 6-4) in the first match. He then beat Djokovic in a tight match where Djokovic had trouble with his contact lenses, prevailing (7-5, 6-2). A further victory against Berdych, (7-6(3), 6-1), sent him to his third World Tour Final semi-final. It was the first time he had won all three round-robins, in stark contrast to the previous year. In the semi-finals, he was thrice two points from defeat and was able to win the match on his third match point (7-6(5), 3-6, 7-6(6)). In the final, Nadal lost against Roger Federer with a score of (3-6, 6-3, 1-6). This was Nadal's last tournament in the 2010 professional tennis season.\nMatch for Africa.\nFinally, he played Federer in the two-match exhibition Match for Africa for the Roger Federer Foundation and the Rafa Nadal Foundation. The first match took place in Zürich on December 21, 2010, and was won by Federer, (4-6, 6-3, and 6-3). The following match was played in Madrid, and Nadal beat Federer with a score of (7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-1).\nAll matches.\nSingles.\nSource (ATP)\nDoubles.\nSource (ATP)"

        "title": "American Football Association (1977–1983)",
        "text": "The American Football Association (AFA) was a professional American football minor league that operated from 1977 to 1983.\nThe AFA was concentrated in the southern United States and served as the second tier of professional football between the World Football League, which folded in 1975, and the United States Football League, which began play in 1983. Unlike the WFL or USFL, the AFA always fashioned itself as a minor league, and never planned to rival the National Football League for \"major league\" status. Players were paid one percent of gross gate revenue, which often meant players were paid only menial sums for their service (often comparable to minimum wage for three hours of work), and the league struggled to acquire recognizable players.\nThe league played its games on Saturday nights in the summer (beginning its season Memorial Day weekend and ending in August) to avoid direct competition against other football in the fall, a move that foreshadowed the USFL's similar spring football schedule. The AFA ended operations in 1983, unable to take advantage of the strike that hit the NFL the year prior or weather the competition from the USFL.\nTeams and cities represented.\nMany nicknames came from previous leagues, with minor alterations to avoid trademark disputes: the Steamer, Vulcans and Fire all took their names from WFL teams, while the Rockets borrowed their moniker from a Continental Football League and United Football League team of the same name.\nThe operations were often fly-by-night, with most teams lasting only one season (or less) before folding, and players played for a paycheck equal to one percent of the net gate receipts after expenses (In August 1980, Shreveport Times sports reporter Ron Higgins estimated the average Steamer game check to be about $35 per man).\nDespite its minor-league status, the league's teams often were able to secure leases for unusually large stadiums, often those used by the WFL and the USFL: the Orlando Americans, in their lone season, played in the 70,000-seat Citrus Bowl, while the Vulcans and Magic played at similarly-sized Legion Field, Houston played at 73,000 seat Rice Stadium, and the Fire played at Soldier Field. The Mustangs played at 30,000-seat Skelly Stadium. The Jacksonville Firebirds played in the Gator Bowl.\nHistory.\nThe AFA was founded in May 1977 and began to play that summer. It was formed to take advantage of the places where the WFL was the most popular, while avoiding the overspending that led to that league's demise.\nBilly Kilmer, the former NFL quarterback (and coach of the AFA's Shreveport Steamer in 1979), was named commissioner in 1981. Kilmer lasted one season as commissioner, working unpaid, during which he encountered numerous problems in the AFA, including a scandal in San Antonio which a player named Robert Lee Johnson misrepresented himself as former NFL offensive lineman Randy Johnson. The Carolina Chargers, one of the league's more successful and stable teams, dropped out of the league mid-season but re-emerged in 1982 under new ownership as the Carolina Storm.\nIn 1982, with former San Antonio Wings executive Roger Gill at the helm, the league attempted to expand northward by absorbing other semi-pro teams in Buffalo, New York, Racine, Wisconsin and Canton, Ohio.\nThe USFL's securing of a TV contract, especially after the AFA had failed to do so (the AFA was only able to get a few of its teams onto local cable stations, still a nascent technology at the time), led to the AFA eventually declining into semi-pro status and folding after its 1983 season.\nThe AFA lasted six seasons, one of the longest runs of a minor professional football organization in the sport's history, and considered the strongest league in the era between the WFL and the USFL. The development of arena football and its numerous imitators has effectively reduced most outdoor leagues to amateur or semi-pro status.\nThe modern American Football Association, a sanctioning body for semi-pro and amateur football, is unrelated to the former AFA.\n1977.\nHarry Lander and Roger Gill, from the existing San Antonio Charros amateur club, decided to create a new minor league football league and attract local investors. Five other clubs from Houston, Fort Worth, Austin, Wichita Falls, and Oklahoma City joined the Charros to establish the AFA.\nThe plan was to play two exhibition games, and then each team would play twelve regular-season games beginning on July 2. The players were promised 1% of each game's gate receipts.\nAfter three games (including two preseason) where they failed to score any points, the Fort Worth Stars were forced out of the league, while the Houston franchise—which had failed to secure a home stadium, pay their league dues, or secure medical insurance for their players—folded mid-August.\nThe San Antonio Charros finished undefeated in the regular season and were declared league champions.\n1978.\nThe AFA entered an agreement for a loose affiliation with the California Football League for the 1978 season, that both leagues will play their normal league schedules, and at the end of the season the champions of each league will play in the \"King Kong Bowl\" to determine the \"national champion\".\nPlayoffs.\n\"Indicates overtime victory.\"\nKing Kong Bowl \n(September 30 at State Fair Stadium) \nSan Jose Tigers 32 vs. Shreveport Steamer 6\n1979.\nThe league grow to nine teams and had plans to divide to Eastern and Western divisions, but after Tulsa Mustangs folded the remaining teams has gone from two divisions format to one, with the top four teams making the playoffs.\n1980.\nThe AFA started the season with eight teams and split up to Eastern and Western divisions. The league revoked Kentucky Trackers license after several cases of misconduct with four remaining weeks in the regular season. The Trackers' remaining games was filled with semi-pro teams from the Atlantic Coast League and the Dixie League, but those games did not count in AFA standings.\n1981.\nBilly Kilmer was introduced as the first full-time commissioner of the American Football Association. Also, for the first time, the league expended behind southern United States, when they add the Chicago Fire.The Chargers players voted to walk out on the team four games into the season, while both Shreveport Steamer and Austin Texans folded before season end, resulting in Kilmer resignation before the American Bowl. He was replaced by AFA president Roger Gill.\nDuring the season a member of the Orlando Americans admits he impersonated former NFL guard Randy Johnson to make the team. He was discovered when he couldn't crack the starting lineup.\n\"Includes forfeit games.\"\n1982.\nThe AFA expanded to 18 teams, and split up to three divisions, while two teams (Florida Sun and Roanoke Valley Express) folded mid-season.\n\"Includes forfeit games.\"\nPlayoffs.\nFirst Round (August 7): \n\"Racine 44\" vs. Akron 6\n\"Carolina 61\" vs. West Virginia 18\n\"Texas 17\" vs. Oklahoma 14\n\"Shreveport 42\" vs. Georgia 35\n1983.\nIt was the seventh and final year of the AFA. The United Football Teams of America league champion – Oklahoma City Drillers – joined the league but later announced that they would play the season as a travelling team before folding altogether after two weeks. The majority of the teams followed, and the league decided that division champions Carolina and San Antonio would meet in the final American Bowl.\nThe Bulls knew before season's end that they would join the United States Football League as an expansion team for the 1984 season, where they played as the San Antonio Gunslingers (as the Jacksonville Bulls had already claimed rights to the \"Bulls\" name)."

        "text": "WrestleMania XXX was the 30th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on April 6, 2014, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana and was the first WWE event simultaneously broadcast live on PPV and livestreamed on WWE's subscription streaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan served as the host of the event.\nSeven matches were contested on the event's card, including one on the Pre-Show. In the main event, Daniel Bryan defeated Batista and defending champion Randy Orton in a triple threat match to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship after Bryan qualified for the match by defeating Triple H in the opening bout. In other prominent matches, John Cena defeated Bray Wyatt and Brock Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to end his undefeated streak at WrestleMania. The event also saw the WWE Divas Championship defended on the main card, the first and only time it was contested for at WrestleMania.\nWWE claimed $10.9 million in ticket revenue for WrestleMania XXX and estimated a $142.2 million economic impact on New Orleans. The event has received highly positive reviews, and is often regarded as one of the greatest WrestleMania events of all time. \"SLAM! Wrestling\" rated the show a 4.5 out of 5, while \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" rated the event 8.75 out of 10 and \"The Times-Picayune\" described it as \"spectacular\". Particular praise has been given to the overall Daniel Bryan vs. The Authority storyline, which culminated at the event. Despite the event's positive reception, the decision to have Brock Lesnar end The Undertaker's undefeated streak polarized fans, critics, and former wrestlers.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. \nOn February 18, 2013, WWE announced that WrestleMania XXX would be held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana on April 6, 2014. The event is alternatively known as WrestleMania 30. On August 12, travel packages for WrestleMania XXX went on sale, which included tickets to WrestleMania, hotel room accommodation, and other activities including WrestleMania Axxess, the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, and the next \"Raw\"; the cheapest package cost $795 per person. On November 16, individual tickets went on sale through Ticketmaster, with prices ranging from $25 to $850. \nIn addition to being sold as a pay-per-view through television providers (with prices ranging from $55–$70), WrestleMania XXX was the first WWE PPV event to be livestreamed in simulcast on the WWE Network—WWE's subscription streaming service that launched in February with video on demand access to WWE's library, original programming, and pay-per-view events, costing $9.99 per month with a six-month contract. \nThe event was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Louisiana. There were three official theme songs for the event, \"Celebrate\" by Kid Rock, \"Legacy\" by Eminem, and \"\" by Mark Collie. A promotional poster for the event was released through pay-per-view providers such as In Demand, with the tagline \"laissez les bons temps rouler\". The WrestleMania set was built by a crew of roughly 400 workers over two weeks, assembling equipment carried by 85 semi-trailer trucks.\nAfter the Royal Rumble event in late January 2014, CM Punk reportedly legitimately walked out on WWE while still under contract and WWE stopped promoting him for future events; which \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" editor Wade Keller analysed as playing a part in Daniel Bryan's WrestleMania journey. In May 2014, Bryan revealed in an interview that he also believed that WWE decided to give him the big WrestleMania spotlight only after Punk quit.\nDaniel Bryan entered the event as the bookmakers' favorite to walk out of WrestleMania as champion, while the biggest favorite to earn a victory was the Undertaker, which \"Forbes\" endorsed as \"as close to a sure thing as you're going to find\".\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including one on the Pre-Show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nDaniel Bryan's eight-month road to WrestleMania began at SummerSlam in August 2013, when he started feuding with Triple H and Randy Orton. Since June, Bryan had been praised as one of the top performers in WWE by critics and veterans of the professional wrestling industry, as his rise in status led him to a title shot at SummerSlam. At SummerSlam, Bryan defeated John Cena to win his first WWE Championship with Triple H as the special guest referee. After the match, Triple H turned heel by attacking Bryan, which directly led to Orton using his Money in the Bank title opportunity for an immediate title shot. Orton pinned a downed Bryan to capture the WWE Championship. After SummerSlam, Triple H claimed that it was a \"business decision\" to sabotage Bryan because Bryan did not fit the type of wrestler that the company was looking for as its champion; therefore, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon (later known as The Authority) instead endorsed Orton as the \"face of the WWE\". Over the next few months, Bryan was constantly sabotaged in his attempts to gain and hold on to the WWE Championship. Bryan defeated Orton to regain the WWE Championship at Night of Champions, but due to referee Scott Armstrong making a fast count, Triple H stripped Bryan of the title the next night on \"Raw\". At Battleground, a match between Bryan and Orton for the vacant title ended in a no contest when Big Show (who had been manipulated by the Authority in the weeks prior) attacked both men. Bryan once again challenged Orton in a Hell in a Cell match for the vacant championship at Hell in a Cell; Triple H interfered in the match and was attacked by Bryan, resulting in special guest referee Shawn Michaels attacking Bryan, which led to Orton capturing the WWE Championship again.\nAt , WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena in a TLC match to unify the two titles into the new WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In January 2014, Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010, and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Batista's win and Daniel Bryan's lack of participation in the Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live crowd at the Royal Rumble. At Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista (who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Daniel Bryan also participated in the Elimination Chamber match, but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane, who was affiliated with the Authority.\nFrustrated over being constantly cost the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority, Bryan challenged Triple H to a match at WrestleMania XXX. When Triple H refused Bryan's challenge, Bryan brought a large group of fans on the March 10 episode of \"Raw\" to \"occupy\" the ring and refused to leave. An irate Triple H agreed to Bryan's demand for a WrestleMania match with the stipulation that if Bryan won, he would be inserted into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. On the March 17 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H voiced his frustrations over Orton and Batista, then changed the stipulation of his own match, guaranteeing that the winner between him and Bryan would be added to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match, thus assuring a triple threat match for the title.\nOn the February 24 episode of \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their complaints about Lesnar not being in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, in his first appearance since April 2013, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's challenge by stabbing Lesnar with a pen and performing a chokeslam on Lesnar through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar would attempt to break The Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania.\nAt the Royal Rumble, The Wyatt Family (Luke Harper, Erick Rowan, and Bray Wyatt) cost John Cena his match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Randy Orton. At the Elimination Chamber event, the Wyatt Family attacked Cena during his Elimination Chamber match for the same championship, which directly led to Cena's elimination from the match. Wyatt was motivated by a desire to end \"this era of lies\", beginning with Cena, because he wanted to expose to the world that Cena being an upholder of all that is moral and good and right was merely a hollow illusion. Proving that Cena was a fraud would ruin his legacy, but Wyatt wanted to take it one step further by turning Cena into a monster. On the March 10 episode of \"Raw\", Cena issued Wyatt a challenge for a match at WrestleMania, which Wyatt accepted.\nEvent.\nCommentary.\nAnalysis was hosted by Josh Mathews with Mick Foley, Booker T, and Shawn Michaels; joining midway were retired National Football League linebacker Shawne Merriman, Jimmy Hart, Alex Riley, and Trish Stratus. Renee Young directed social media discussion, while Byron Saxton and Tom Phillips conducted backstage interviews.\nPre-show.\nThe WrestleMania Pre-Show was split into two segments, each an hour long; the first half could be watched for free on WWE.com, YouTube, and other social media outlets, while the second half (which had the pre-show match) was only available on the WWE Network.\nThe Pre-Show match was a fatal four-way elimination tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship between defending champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), RybAxel (Ryback and Curtis Axel), Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando), accompanied by El Torito, and The Real Americans (Jack Swagger and Cesaro), (accompanied by Zeb Colter). Swagger applied the Patriot Lock on Fernando to eliminate Los Matadores, followed by Cesaro, who performed a European uppercut after throwing Ryback in the air and hit a Neutralizer on Ryback to eliminate RybAxel. In the closing moments, after Jey Uso threw Cesaro into Swagger, Jimmy Uso tagged in and the Usos performed a double superkick and then a double top rope diving splash on Cesaro to retain the titles. Following the match, Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and applied the Patriot Lock in Cesaro. Colter demanded that they put their differences aside, however, Cesaro performed the giant swing on Swagger and walked off.\nMiscellaneous.\nThe English commentators for the event were Michael Cole, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, and Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, while there were also Spanish and French commentators at ringside. Justin Roberts and Lilian Garcia acted as ring announcers. Charles Robinson and John Cone were noted to have refereed Triple H's and John Cena's matches respectively.\nDuring the event, the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame inductees (Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, Mr. T, Carlos Colon, Lita, Scott Hall, and The Ultimate Warrior), along with brothers Daniel and Paul Moody, real life sons of deceased Hall of Fame inductee Paul Bearer, who appeared before the live audience after Howard Finkel introduced them. Two backstage segments included WWE veterans; the first consisted of Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Sgt. Slaughter, Ricky Steamboat, \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and Ron Simmons. The second consisted of wrestlers involved in the main event match at WrestleMania I, with Hulk Hogan, Mr. T, Rowdy Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff. Pat Patterson, and Mean Gene Okerlund also appeared. Meanwhile, WWE Hall of Famers Bruno Sammartino, Harley Race, Bob Backlund, Dusty Rhodes, and Bret Hart were shown at ringside.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view event started when host Hulk Hogan came down to the ring for a segment, at one point accidentally calling the Superdome the \"Silverdome\". A few moments later, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin joined him in the ring, teasing a confrontation between the two. After that, The Rock also came down to the ring. The three reminisced about past WrestleManias and led the crowd in their signature chants and catchphrases. They then shared a number of beers together before departing the ring.\nIn the first match on the pay-per-view, Daniel Bryan faced Triple H (who was accompanied by Stephanie McMahon) where the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night. Bryan kicked away Triple H's handshake and started the match strongly, including performing a tornado DDT off the apron. Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a hammerlock belly-to-back suplex on the apron. Triple H applied the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface on Bryan, however, Bryan did not submit. Bryan applied a Yes! Lock\" on Triple H, however, Triple H reached the ropes to void the submission. As Bryan attempted a running knee, Triple H countered with a spinebuster and Pedigree for a nearfall. In the end, Bryan performed the running knee on Triple H to win the match. Following the match, McMahon slapped Bryan and distracting him long enough for Triple H to attack him from behind. Triple H placed Bryan's injured arm against the ring post and struck it with a steel folding chair. Medical staff tended to Bryan while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage.\nNext, The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and Kane faced The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns). In the end, Reigns performed a Spear on Kane, and Reigns then performed another Spear on both Outlaws simultaneously. The Shield then performed their Triple Powerbomb maneuver on both Outlaws to win the match.\nAfter that, the battle royal for the André the Giant Memorial Trophy was contested. Yoshi Tatsu, Brad Maddox and Brodus Clay were eliminated by The Great Khali. Khali was eliminated by all three members of 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal). Mark Henry then eliminated 3MB, followed by Big Show eliminating Henry. Fandango eliminated Big E and showboated on the ring apron, prompting Sheamus to perform over 20 forearm clubs to Fandango's chest and eliminate him. Cesaro, an unannounced entrant who had wrestled on the pre-show, eliminated Rey Mysterio with a European uppercut and then threw Kofi Kingston out of the ring, however, Kingston survived as his feet landed on the ring steps. Kingston returned to the match only for Sheamus to eliminate him. Alberto Del Rio, who had earlier eliminated Goldust and Cody Rhodes, eliminated Dolph Ziggler. The final four were Del Rio, Sheamus, Cesaro and Show. Del Rio and Sheamus eliminated each other, leaving Cesaro and Show to fight back and forth until Cesaro lifted Show and body slammed him out of the ring to win the match and trophy, mirroring Hulk Hogan's momentous body slam of André the Giant at WrestleMania III in March 1987.\nNext, John Cena faced Bray Wyatt (who was accompanied by Luke Harper and Erick Rowan). Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and imploring Cena to become the monster that he is and to finish him off, however, Cena refused. Wyatt then continued to taunt Cena which led to Cena's aggressive retaliation. As Cena was about to perform a Five Knuckle Shuffle on Wyatt, Wyatt responded with a 'crab pose' that shocked Cena into retreating. Wyatt performed a DDT on Cena on the apron for a nearfall. Cena performed a Crossbody on Harper and Rowan who were at ringside. Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Wyatt for a nearfall. Cena applied the STF on Wyatt, however, Wyatt reached the ropes to void the submission. Wyatt performed a Sister Abigail on Cena for a near fall. In the closing moments, Wyatt obtained a steel folding chair and tossed it to Cena, once again imploring Cena to use it on him, however, Cena instead attacked Rowan (who was standing on the ring apron), and Wyatt capitalized by rolling Cena up for a near-fall. Cena then countered another Sister Abigail attempt and performed an Attitude Adjustment to win the match.\nIn the next match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) faced The Undertaker. The match started out with Lesnar clotheslining Undertaker over the top rope, with the latter landing on his feet; both men went into early chokeslam and F-5 teases, but easily avoided the finishers. They then moved out of the ring; almost six minutes in, Lesnar slammed Undertaker onto the floor, resulting in a serious head concussion that would last throughout the match. Lesnar then sent Undertaker onto a guardrail, before getting him back to the ring. After a few jabs from Lesnar, Undertaker hit him with a DDT off the ropes to buy some time. At 12 minutes, Undertaker put the Snake Eyes into a big boot and dropped the leg for a two-count, followed by a chokeslam, and then an attempted Tombstone Piledriver before Lesnar countered with an F-5, which Undertaker kicked out of. Undertaker applied the Hell's Gate on Lesnar, however, Lesnar broke the hold by lifting Undertaker up and powerbombing him. After some more Hell's Gates and Kimura Locks applied by both men, Lesnar countered an Old School attempt by Undertaker into another F-5 for a nearfall. Undertaker responded with a Last Ride powerbomb and a Tombstone Piledriver for a nearfall. As Undertaker attempted a second Tombstone Piledriver, Lesnar countered and performed an F-5 on Undertaker to win the match, ending the Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania. Heyman then \"freaked out\" at the result and WWE did not play Lesnar's theme music immediately after his victory, highlighting the reaction of a shocked and stunned crowd, just before Justin Roberts announced Lesnar as the winner. Instead, a graphic was displaying on the stadiums screens showing the Undertaker's WrestleMania record of \"21-1\". The crowd eventually booed Lesnar as he left. Undertaker was left in the ring, where he gathered himself. As he slowly walked up the entrance ramp, WWE's announcers gave him a standing ovation while the crowd chanted his name which was accompanied by various \"thank you Taker\" chants.\nThe penultimate match was the 14-Diva single-fall Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational for the WWE Divas Championship in which AJ Lee defended the title against the entire Divas division; this marked the only time the title was defended at a WrestleMania. The match started with the other wrestlers attacking Lee and her bodyguard, Tamina Snuka. As the match progressed, Aksana met Naomi at the top rope. Natalya performed a powerbomb superplex combination on Aksana. Snuka pulled Aksana out of the ring to prevent Natalya from winning, so Natalya clotheslined Snuka on the outside but was prevented from re-entering the ring due to Lee kicking her. In the end, Lee applied the Black Widow on Naomi, who submitted, to retain the title. WWE reported that Lee won by moving Naomi's hand unto the mat to deceive the referee into thinking that Naomi had submitted.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Randy Orton defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Daniel Bryan and Batista. During the match, Orton began to target Bryan's injured arm to momentarily neutralize him. Later, as Bryan applied the Yes! Lock on Orton, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage and pulled the referee out of the ring. Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf, distracting Bryan. Batista took advantage and performed the Batista Bomb on Bryan for a nearfall. Bryan kicked Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H, Stephanie, and Armstrong. Triple H obtained a sledgehammer, however, Bryan snatched it and used the sledgehammer on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron and ending Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's interference in the match. Batista performed a Batista Bomb on Bryan onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of an RKO. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher, however, Bryan refused medical attention and continued the match. Orton performed an RKO on Batista for a near fall. Orton attempted to hit a punt kick to Batista, but Bryan performed a running knee on Orton, only for Batista to toss Bryan out of the ring and pin Orton instead, which resulted in a near fall. In the end, after Batista performed a Batista Bomb on Orton, Bryan performed a running knee on Batista and applied the \"Yes! Lock\". Batista fought the hold but eventually had to submit, giving the win and the title to Bryan. The pay-per-view ended with Bryan celebrating his win, including fireworks, confetti, pyrotechnics and Bryan leading the crowd in a \"Yes!\" chant.\nReception.\nThe event was a critical and commercial success. On the day of the event, WWE claimed that the event had drawn $10.9 million in ticket revenue at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans with an attendance figure of 75,167. WWE also claimed it was the fifth consecutive year that WrestleMania broke the host venue's highest-grossing entertainment event record. Within a week of the event, WWE management and New Orleans city officials declared WrestleMania XXX to be a big success, with SMG general manager Alan Freeman declaring that New Orleans \"certainly would like to host the event again ... anything after 2018 is probably open at this point\". WWE later claimed that WrestleMania XXX had a $142.2 million economic impact on New Orleans, generated $24.3 million in local taxes and that 79% of attendees were from outside of New Orleans. The figures were higher than those of the previous two WrestleManias.\nThe day after the event, WWE revealed that the initial number of WWE Network subscribers was 667,287, therefore that was the maximum number of people who could have watched the event on the WWE Network. Bandwidth optimizing company Qwilt reported that WrestleMania XXX led to WWE accounting for 6.5% of all online video traffic in North America on that day, ranking third below Netflix and YouTube but above Amazon, Hulu, and HBO. WrestleMania XXX generated 20 times more traffic for the WWE Network than what the Network would have gained on a regular day at the time. On April 15, WWE announced \"nearly 400,000 domestic PPV buys\" for the event, while the previous year's WrestleMania (before the existence of the WWE Network) had earned 1,039,000 buys. In June 2014, WWE reported 690,000 total buys from both domestic and international sources.\nThe Associated Press article on WrestleMania XXX focused on Hulk Hogan's hosting of the event, commenting that \"the Hulkster showed he can host, 30 years later.\" Hogan was \"overseeing the mayhem for 75,000-plus fans, and countless more watching on TV ... and what a scene it was\", referring to Cesaro winning the Andre the Giant battle royal \"by heaving the sizeable Big Show over the top rope\". Brock Lesnar's win over the Undertaker was simply described as \"the night's shocker\".\n\"The Times-Picayune\" reported on the event, with Daniel Bryan's win of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship win being profiled on the front page with the headline \"YES, INDEED!\". Gene Guillot of \"The Times-Picayune\" also reviewed the event; describing it as \"spectacular\" and that it \"delivered three memorable moments, one for each X\". Regarding the setup, Guillot wrote that \"the set was magnificent, the pyro and lighting impeccable and the pageantry unparalleled\". Guillot described the first moment which started the show as \"classic\" when \"the three biggest stars in the history of the business were in the same ring\"; The Rock, Hulk Hogan and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Next, Guillot wrote that \"the second indelible moment nearly stopped the show\", describing the end of the Undertaker's Streak as \"the biggest surprise ending in WrestleMania history—and maybe even wrestling history\". Finally, the third moment which closed the show was \"Bryan holding and hoisting in unison the two championships that represent the WWE World Heavyweight Championship while on his knees in the ring\", which Guillot predicted \"will go down among the greatest moments in WrestleMania history\".\nNolan Howell of \"Slam! Wrestling\" commented that \"WrestleMania XXX brings the beginning and end of eras\". His star ratings out of 5 stars (*****) for each match are as follows; *** for the pre-show match, ****1/2 for Bryan-HHH, **1/2 for the Shield's match, **3/4 for the battle royal, **** for Cena-Wyatt, ** for Undertaker-Lesnar, 0.75 stars for the Divas' match and lastly ***3/4 for the main event. Overall, he gave the event 4.5 out of 5 stars.\nDave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" summed up WrestleMania XXX as a \"very newsworthy show to say the least\". Daniel Bryan's first match was described as a long technical one, and although Meltzer did not consider it \"a match of the year or probably even the week\", it \"was the caliber of a good PPV main event\". Triple H's post-match attack on Bryan was said to be a \"very basic\" storyline \"but it's also exactly what they should have done\". Bryan's second match in the main event was described as \"really great\" with many twists and turns, while the match result was \"again exactly what they should have done\" and \"the crowd reacted the way you would expect\". Meltzer thought that \"the people just weren't into\" the Undertaker's match as \"nobody bought that Lesnar could win\". Meanwhile, he felt that the Undertaker's departure was \"certainly teased like a retirement\". For the battle royal, Meltzer noted the lack of (surprise) entrants such as Rob Van Dam, Alexander Rusev, Christian, or Wade Barrett. In other notes, Meltzer described the strong fan support for Cesaro and also labeled Cena's win as a \"genuine upset\".\nJustin LaBar of the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" summed up WrestleMania XXX as \"shocking\", but \"one of the best\". LaBar commented that he was \"bored\" with the Undertaker's match, just waiting for the final stretch as \"Undertaker was going to win anyway\". When Lesnar won, LaBar said that he had \"never been part of a more real and emotionally driven moment\". LaBar also commented that \"Antonio Cesaro is here to stay\" and described WWE as \"the ultimate puppet master\" because \"Daniel Bryan \"finally\" wins the world title and it still isn't the top story from that event.\"\nBenjamin Tucker of the \"Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter\" attended the event, and he scored the event 8.75 out of 10. He stated, that WrestleMania XXX \"served as an event meant to respect the past while looking forward to the future\" just like WrestleMania XX, with wrestlers like Bryan and Cesaro \"spotlighted as the future of WWE\". However, Tucker noted that \"saying goodbye to the past proved harder than anyone could imagine\" with the end of the Undertaker's Streak. He said this, and not WrestleMania 28, was the true \"End of an Era\" but Tucker did not \"think it could have ended on a worse note\" with over 15 minutes of \"slow, subpar action\". Tucker commented that the lack of hype before the event of the Streak being in jeopardy made it less of a defining moment when Lesnar broke it and more of \"an indictment on whoever okay'ed the decision to let this happen\". However, \"Bryan was there to save the day\" with two well-executed matches, making those in \"attendance momentarily forget about Taker and root for the underdog who was finally getting his chance to shine\". Tucker praised the booking of the match as perfect with its numerous false finishes.\nFor the rest of the event, Tucker commented that Wyatt \"lost nothing by losing, but Cena certainly lost a lot by winning. The man shows no weakness\". Tucker also noted that the segment involving Hogan, Austin and the Rock was \"meaningless, surreal and a lot of fun\". Tucker concluded by saying that the event was \"easily one of the best Manias of the last ten years\" and that \"the future certainly does look bright. If only we could have said our good-byes properly\".\nReflecting in March 2016 just before WrestleMania 32, Luke Winkie of \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote that the WrestleMania XXX resulted in \"pure, cathartic, we-have-this-moment forever joy\".\nIn 2019, Troy L. Smith of \"cleveland.com\" released a list of the \"50 greatest wrestling pay-per-views of all time\" from every professional wrestling promotion in the world, with WrestleMania XXX ranked at number 20.\nCritical analysis.\nThe dramaturgist A.C. Tate noted the audience's role in Daniel Bryan's victory was analogous to that of the chorus in Greek drama. Despite the actor's limited stature, the actor was astute to crowd expectations, thereby ingratiating himself to the layman audience, despite perhaps different expectations from WWE's writers.\nWilson Koch, a cultural anthropologist, commented that Bryan's crowd interactions facilitated diegetic interaction with WWE's fictional universe. In Koch's view, these interactions added authenticity to the worked shoot storyline, allowing fans to suspend disbelief despite the generally cartoonish nature of the performance.\nAftermath.\nThe Ultimate Warrior's first WrestleMania appearance since WrestleMania XII, headlining the unveiling of the 2014 Hall of Famers, would be his last. On April 8, the day after making his last public appearance on \"Raw\" to speak to the fans, Warrior suddenly collapsed and died at age 54 in Arizona. WWE paid tribute to Warrior on the April 14 episode of \"Raw\".\nWWE held an online charity auction centered around WrestleMania XXX from March 31 to April 8, 2014. It raised over $400,000 for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees's \"The Brees Dream Foundation\".\nThe Undertaker was reportedly taken away from the Superdome in an ambulance, which WWE later confirmed was due to him suffering a \"severe concussion\"; he was discharged the next day. In May 2014, Shawn Michaels said that Vince McMahon made the final decision to end the Undertaker's streak about four hours before WrestleMania XXX. McMahon confirmed in December 2014 that it was indeed him who made the final decision and that the Undertaker was initially shocked at the decision. The decision was made due to McMahon believing that it would make a huge deal out of Brock Lesnar to set up the next WrestleMania event. McMahon also said that he did not foresee other viable candidates on the roster to fill Lesnar's role within the near future.\nShort-term.\nDuring the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\" the next night, Triple H immediately used his authority as WWE COO to grant himself a title match against WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan later that night. As Stephanie McMahon tried to persuade Randy Orton, Batista, Kane, and the Shield to help Triple H in his title match, Kane inadvertently revealed that Triple H was the mastermind behind the attack on the Shield on the previous month's \"SmackDown\". As a result, Bryan was attacked by Orton, Batista, and Kane just before his title match, which began anyway at the order of Triple H. However, the title match ended in a no contest with Bryan retaining the title when the Shield interfered, attacked and chased away Triple H, Orton, Batista, and Kane.\nThe following week, Triple H, Orton and Batista reformed Evolution to take on the Shield. Meanwhile, Stephanie McMahon enticed Kane to return to his masked self; Kane complied and was granted a future title match against Bryan, and proceeded to carry out attacks against Bryan and his wife, Brie Bella. At the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, the Shield defeated Evolution while Bryan defeated Kane in an Extreme Rules match to retain the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.\nThe rivalry between John Cena and Bray Wyatt continued. At Extreme Rules, Wyatt defeated Cena in a Steel Cage match, after interference from the rest of the Wyatt Family and a demonic child.\nAlso on the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", Cesaro was endorsed by Hulk Hogan, who presented him with the Andre the Giant battle royal trophy. Cesaro went on to reveal that he found a new manager in Paul Heyman, who would replace Zeb Colter. Cesaro was attacked by his former partner, Jack Swagger, who dismantled Cesaro's trophy. Swagger later cost Cesaro his match against Rob Van Dam in the semi-finals of the Intercontinental Championship #1 contender tournament, while Van Dam later lost in the tournament final due to Cesaro's interference. At Extreme Rules, Cesaro defeated Swagger and Van Dam in an elimination match.\nOn the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", as WWE Divas Champion AJ Lee celebrated her successful title defense at WrestleMania, NXT Women's Champion Paige debuted on the main roster and congratulated Lee on her win. Lee reacted by slapping Paige and challenging her to an impromptu match with the Divas Championship on the line, resulting in Paige pulling out a quick surprise victory to capture the title.\nLong-term.\nDaniel Bryan announced on May 12 that due to injuries, he would require neck surgery, which he underwent on May 15. Bryan was stripped off the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority on June 9 as he was not healthy enough to defend his championship. Due to his injury, Bryan was largely removed from WWE television. John Cena's feud with Bray Wyatt culminated with a Last Man Standing match at Payback on June 1, where Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match and end the feud. Cena won Bryan's vacated WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank on June 29. Brock Lesnar returned on July 21 and proceeded to decisively defeat Cena at SummerSlam to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.\nAt Payback, the Shield ended their feud with Evolution by defeating them in a six-man No Holds Barred elimination match. On the next \"Raw\" on June 2, Batista quit WWE in the storyline as Triple H, in wanting to continue the feud with the Shield, refused to grant Batista a one-on-one match for the WWE World Heavyweight title. Later that night, Seth Rollins turned on his Shield teammates and allied himself with Triple H's Authority, eventually winning the Money in the Bank briefcase. The remaining members of the Shield, Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, went their separate ways by the end of June. Cesaro ended his association with Paul Heyman in July on the night of Brock Lesnar's return. By that time, Cesaro had failed to win title matches for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the Intercontinental Championship and the United States Championship.\nAt Night of Champions in September 2014, the Usos' tag title reign ended at the hands of Gold and Stardust. Also at the event, AJ Lee became a three-time Divas Champion by capturing the title from Paige. Paige and AJ had exchanged the Divas Championship several times after WrestleMania, firstly on the June 30 episode of \"Raw\" and secondly at SummerSlam.\nIn January 2015, Daniel Bryan returned to the ring having recovered from his injury. That month at the Royal Rumble event, Brock Lesnar retained his title in a triple threat match against John Cena and Seth Rollins; the New Age Outlaws' return to the ring saw them lose to the Ascension, while Roman Reigns won the Royal Rumble match. The live audience booed Reigns' win and Bryan's early elimination from the match. In February, Reigns defeated Bryan at Fastlane to receive a WrestleMania main event title match against Lesnar, while Cesaro and Tyson Kidd won the Tag Team Championship from the Usos.\nAt WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, the main event began as a singles match for champion Brock Lesnar against challenger Roman Reigns. More than ten minutes into the match, Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to make it a triple threat match; Rollins pinned Reigns shortly after to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In other matches, Daniel Bryan wrestled in the pay-per-view opener, a seven-man ladder match, and won the Intercontinental Championship from Bad News Barrett. Next, Rollins lost a singles match to Randy Orton. Then, Triple H defeated Sting in another singles match. A tag match followed where AJ Lee teamed with Paige to defeat Nikki Bella and Brie Bella. Next, Cena scored another WrestleMania victory, this time at the expense of Rusev, while Cena captured the United States Championship. In the penultimate match, the Undertaker (in his return to TV) defeated Bray Wyatt. On the pre-show, Cesaro and Tyson Kidd successfully defended the tag titles, while Big Show won the second Andre the Giant memorial battle royal.\nThe Undertaker reignited his feud with Brock Lesnar at Battleground by causing a no contest for his WWE World Heavyweight Championship match against Seth Rollins and then proceeded to controversially defeat Lesnar in a rematch at SummerSlam. The feud ended at the 2015 Hell in a Cell event with Lesnar defeating Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match.\nA fictionalised version of WrestleMania XXX was depicted in the film \"Fighting with My Family\" (2019), a biopic of the wrestler Paige."

        "text": "Joe Taylor (born May 7, 1950) is an American college athletics administrator and former football coach. He is the athletic director at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, a position he has held since 2013. Taylor served as the head football coach at Howard University in 1983, Virginia Union from 1984 to 1991, Hampton University from 1992 to 2007, and Florida A&amp;M University from 2008 to 2012, compiling a career college football coaching record of 232–96–4. Taylor led the Hampton Pirates to five black college football national championships (1994, 1997, 2004, 2005, and 2006) and eight conference titles. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2019.\nEarly years.\nTaylor is a native of Washington, D.C. He graduated from Western Illinois University in 1972 and began his coaching career at H. D. Woodson High School in Washington, D.C. He served as a physical education teacher, head wrestling coach, and assistant football and baseball coach in the District of Columbia schools.\nIn 1978, Taylor was hired as the offensive line coach at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. He helped lead Eastern Illinois to the 1978 NCAA Division II Football Championship.\nIn 1980, Taylor was hired as the offensive coordinator at Virginia Union University, a historically black university (HBCU) located in Richmond, Virginia. After two years at Virginia Union, Taylor became the defensive coordinator at Howard University, an HBCU in Washington, D.C. He was named the head football coach at Howard in 1983. He had a 1–9 record in his only season as head coach at Howard.\nVirginia Union.\nIn 1984, Taylor was hired by Virginia Union as its head football coach. In 1986, Taylor led Virginia Union to an undefeated regular season, a Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship and a berth in the NCAA Division II playoffs. His teams also made the Division II playoffs in 1990 and 1991. The 1990 team went undefeated as well. In eight years as the head coach at Virginia Union, Taylor compiled a record of 60–19–3 for a .750 winning percentage.\nHampton.\nFrom 1992 to 2007, Taylor was the head football coach at Hampton University, an HBCU located in Hampton, Virginia. In his first three years at Hampton, the school played in NCAA Division II and the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA). In 1993, Taylor's team was undefeated in the regular season, advanced to the quarterfinal round of the national playoffs, and became the first CIAA team in history to win 12 games in a season. In 1994, Hampton broke the CIAA total offense record with 5,575 yards and became the first CIAA team to average more than 500 yards of total offense per game. By the end of the 1994 season, Hampton had won 23 straight games against CIAA opponents. In recognition of his achievement, Taylor selected as College Coach of the Year in Virginia for 1994 by the Portsmouth Sports Club.\nIn 1995, Hampton moved up to NCAA Division I-AA (now known as Division I FCS) play and joined the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) in 1996. Taylor continued to win at the Division I-AA level and became \"the most successful football coach in Hampton history.\" Taylor's Hampton teams won five black college national championships (1994, 1997, 2004, 2005, and 2006), eight conference titles (three in the CIAA and five in the MEAC), the 1999 Heritage Bowl, and seven trips to the NCAA playoffs. He was also named MEAC Coach of the Year for three straight years from 2004 to 2006.\nThe seniors on Taylor's 2006 team won three consecutive black college national championships. Taylor called the 2006 squad the best in Hampton history. He said, \"Start by looking at what they've accomplished as a group. The seniors are 22–2 in the conference the past three seasons. They are 31–4 overall during that time and 38–8 for the four years. Because of their record, they went onto the field with a bull's-eye on our back every game this year. The kids survived that onslaught and got better, while dealing with a higher number of injuries than ever before.\"\nIn 2004, a New Jersey newspaper published a feature story on Taylor. Hampton athletic director Dennis Thomas asserted that Taylor had earned his chance to coach a major Division I-A program, but noted that he wouldn't be able to name a black coach out of a black university getting a chance to be a big-time college football coach, \"It's never happened. What's that telling you?\" Taylor insisted that the lack of offers did not eat at him or leave him bitter. He noted:\"I've always seen coaching more about being a ministry than about X's and O's. I want to make a difference, and I think I do that where I'm coaching now. You won't hear me bellyache. You can do anything in this world if you believe in it and map it out. If one man can do it, that means another man can do it too. Do what Sylvester Croom has done. Do what Tyrone Willingham has done. There's a road map out there, I tell the young coaches now. Follow what they did.\"\nIn 16 years as the head coach at Hampton, he compiled a record of 136 wins, 49 losses and one tie for a .734 winning percentage. Taylor's tenure produced a good number of great Hampton Pirate players who went on to the National Football League and Canadian Football League. The list include: Kendall Langford, Justin Durant, Nevin McCaskill, Alonzo Coleman, Zuriel Smith, Jerome Mathis, Marquay McDaniel, Onrea Jones, Travarous Bain, Darian Barnes, Cordell Taylor and Isaac Hilton. These players were All-MEAC selections, as well as Black College Football All-Americans, and Div I-AA All-Americans during their college careers.\nFlorida A&amp;M.\nIn December 2007, Taylor announced that he would leave Hampton to coach at Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU), an HBCU in Tallahassee, Florida. Taylor's contract with FAMU was reported to be for five years with a base salary of $225,000 and a $12,000 housing allowance. FAMU plays in the NCAA Division I Football Championship. When Taylor took over, the FAMU football team was coming off a 3–8 season, had gone 29–35 since 2001, and was \"reeling after the loss of 14 scholarships in four years.\" In his first two seasons at FAMU, Taylor turned the program into a winner, compiling records of 9–3 in 2008 and 8–3 in 2009. In November 2009, FAMU athletic director Bill Hayes praised Taylor's contributions, \"He has recruited better, and he has inspired and organized the program in such a way that he has been able to maximize the talent here. Joe had such a solid plan and approach to building winners until the players just bought in. They bought into what he was trying to do, and it didn't take him long.\"\nOn Saturday, November 3, 2012, he announced his retirement at the end of the season to his players during their pre-game breakfast prior to that day's game against North Carolina Central. The Rattlers lost that game, falling to 3–6 and ensuring the first losing season in Taylor's tenure at Florida A&amp;M. Just four days later, Taylor announced he was resigning effective immediately.\nPersonal life.\nTaylor is married to the former Beverly Richardson. They have two adult sons, Aaron Taylor and Dennis Taylor. Member of the Noble Klan of Men, Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, Zeta Mu chapter."

        "text": "Eric Hamilton (born September 19, 1953) is an American former college football coach. He served as head football coach at The College of New Jersey from 1977 to 2012, compiling a record of 212–144–6.\nAthlete.\nA native of Bordentown, New Jersey, Hamilton graduated from Bordentown Regional High School in 1971, where he earned all-area and all-league honors playing center for the football team and also competing in track and field.\nHe subsequently attended Trenton State College, now known as The College of New Jersey (\"TCNJ\" or \"New Jersey\"), in the early 1970s. He played center for the Trenton State Lions football teams from 1971 to 1974. He was named an all-conference player three times and received All-ECAC honors in 1973 and 1974. He also received All-American designations in 1974 from Kodak, the Associated Press, the United Press International.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from Trenton State in 1974, Hamilton became a graduate assistant for the Trenton State football team in 1975 and 1976. In January 1977, Hamilton was named the head football coach at TCNJ at age 23. At the time, he was the youngest head football coach at any college in the United States. Interviewed Princeton TV30 in 2008, Hamilton said that his most memorable experience was his first game as head coach at Trenton State. At age 23, he was \"scared to death\" to play on the road on a Friday night in a rain storm and wasn't sure what to say to the team. He put on scuba flippers, and a scuba mask, walked into the locker room and said, \"All right guys, let's go out and play.\" The team won 14–0 in the mud and the rain, and he recalled it as \"the most fun he ever had.\"\nIn 36 years as the head coach, he led the TCNJ Lions football teams to eight New Jersey Athletic Conference championships. His teams also played in NCAA tournaments in 1990, 1996, 1997, and 2007, and in ECAC tournaments in 1995 and 2003. He became the winningest football coach in Trenton State/TCNJ history in 1985 when he won his 56th game at age 32. In 1990, \"The New York Times\" praised the Trenton State team as \"a typical Hamilton team noted for its discipline.\" He has had one 10-win season (1990), three 9-win seasons (1982, 1997, and 2007) and seven 8-win seasons (1980, 1983, 1988, 1989, 1995, 1996 and 1998).\nHamilton reached the 200 career win milestone on October 30, 2010, when TCNJ defeated Western Connecticut State 22–16.\nHamilton is also a leader of the Sunshine Football Classic, an annual football game for high school all-stars held at TCNJ's Lion Stadium to raise money for chronically ill, seriously ill, physically challenged or abused children ages 3–18. The Sunshine Football Classic has been played each year since 1997.\nHamilton retired shortly before the start of TCNJ's 2013 season. During an October 2012 home game against Kean, he and his son Matthew, an assistant at TCNJ, had been involved in a verbal altercation with Kean officers. The elder Hamilton was facing a two-game suspension imposed by the school as a result of the incident; in addition, Matthew was not rehired. In an unrelated matter, Hamilton was also facing an ethics complaint stemming from his prior tenure on a local school board.\nNCAA Football Rules Committee.\nIn 2004, Hamilton began serving a four-year term on the important NCAA football rules committee. Hamilton was involved in the decision to implement, and voted in favor of, the use of instant replay in college football.\nOverall coaching record and awards.\nHamilton compiled a record of 212 wins, 144 losses, and 6 ties. He has received numerous awards for his accomplishments and contributions to the sport of college football, including the following:\nPersonal life.\nHamilton and his wife, Kathleen Hamilton, have five adult children. As noted earlier, one of his sons had been an assistant under him until being released after the 2012 season.\nA resident of Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, Hamilton served on the board of education of the Hamilton Township School District from 1998 to 2012."

        "title": "Lamar Cardinals basketball",
        "text": "The Lamar Cardinals basketball team represents Lamar University in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. The Cardinals currently play in the Southland Conference following a return from the Western Athletic Conference on July 11, 2022. They were one of four programs, all from Texas, that left the Southland Conference on July 1, 2021, to join the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). Lamar left the Southland Conference for the second time, having initially joined at the league's formation in 1963, left in 1987, and returned in 1999. After one season in the WAC, Lamar returned to the Southland Conference. The Cardinals have played home games in the Montagne Center since 1984. The Lamar University basketball team is one of the school's most storied athletic programs. The Cardinals have competed in NCAA Tournament play eleven times (five at the NCAA College Division (Division II) level) and six times at the NCAA Division I level with the most recent appearance in the 2012 tournament. The 1979–80 team was one of the 1980 tournament's Sweet Sixteen teams. The Cardinals have also competed in four NIT tournaments. Heading into the 2014–2015 season Lamar had a 284–143 record in the Montagne Center. The Cardinals overall record going into the 2014–2015 season was 922–818.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nBasketball began in 1923 with the founding of South Park Junior College (renamed Lamar in 1932). In the early years the squad was hurt by a lack of common opponents and routinely had to play local high schools or city amateur teams. By 1931 the squad had been reduced to an intramural level. In 1946 the program was revived as Lamar entered the Southwestern Junior College Conference. The revived squad was an immediate success finishing 2nd with a 10–4 record by head coach Dave Engman. The next year under the veteran coaching of Elbert Pickell the 1947–1948 team pulled an enormous upset by capturing the state title with a 13–3 record. The following year the Cardinals continued to prosper under head coach Thurman \"Slue\" Hull who complied 49–30 record at Lamar before being hired away by the University of Texas. The following year the Cardinals began their transition to play against 4 year college competition with newly hired head coach Jack Martin.\nJack Martin years.\nJack Martin was the first head basketball coach for Lamar as a four-year college. He was also the longest serving head coach in Lamar's history. He came to Lamar after coaching three seasons at his alma mater, Hardin-Simmons University. Martin began coaching the Cardinals as they entered the college division Lone Star Conference in 1951. Martin coached Billy Tubbs from 1955 to 1957, Tubbs would later become the first player or student to return and coach Lamar Basketball. In 1964 Lamar began its transition into division I and the Southland Conference. Coach Martin's Cardinals won the Lone Star Conference title three seasons, the Southland Conference title two seasons, and competed in five NCAA College Division (now NCAA Division II) tournaments. After the 1975–76 season, Coach Martin was replaced by one of his former players and former assistant coach, Billy Tubbs. The Cardinals compiled a 334–283 record under Martin.\nMartin coached one AP NCAA College Division All-American, Don Bryson (1965), and one AP NCAA Division I All-American, Earl Dow (1969). One of Coach Martin's players, Luke Adams, was drafted by the NBA.\n1968–69 Season\nThe highlight of Jack Martin's career would be his 1968–1969 squad that earned a #1 national ranking in the Associated Press college division poll. Martin's squad that year won its first 15 games of the season against very strong competition. The Cardinals won their first game against Pepperdine 65–64 then traveled to Memphis and beat a strong Memphis State team, 82–69. A week later, they quieted a stunned crowd in College Station's G. Rollie White Coliseum by strumming Southwest Conference champion Texas A&amp;M, 98–87. With the Cardinals sitting at 6–0 and sixth-ranked University of Tulsa coming to town, most observers figured the good times were at an end. Instead, they kept rolling as Martin's flashy Cards decked Tulsa, 103–77.\n\"Since we had gone 8–17 the previous season, what that team did to start that year has to be one of the greatest surprises ever in Lamar basketball, at least up until that point,\" said Joe Lee Smith, then LU's director of sports information. \"They beat a good Pepperdine team and an outstanding Memphis State team to get started, then they beat Texas A&amp;M on the road, which was totally unexpected.\n\"Tulsa was ranked No. 6, but we kicked the dog out of them. That triggered a lot of national attention. It was the first year for us to be fully Division I, and after that win we started getting a few votes in the major college polls.\"\nAfter the Cardinals held off Arkansas State 84–81 in Jonesboro to tie the school record of 12-straight wins, they rose to No. 18 in the United Press International major college poll. They were the only team ranked in both polls.\nA few nights later, the prominent Houston Cougars, who had been to the Final Four the previous season, came to McDonald Gym. Coach Guy Lewis' Cougars had never lost to Lamar, up until this point. With 8:15 left in the game, the Cardinals trailed 56–44, but they rallied to go ahead 61–59 in the final minute. The Cougars scored in the final seconds, however, and the teams went into overtime tied at 61.\nThe overflow throng in McDonald Gym and those viewing the game by closed-circuit television in a nearby dining hall erupted into bedlam when forward Jim Nicholson stole the ball and went in for a layup seconds after the overtime tipoff. Then, spindly guard Earl Dow popped in a corner jumper to give the Cards a four-point lead, and they controlled the rest of overtime, winning 71–65.\nOn a cold Feb. 1 night in Abilene, the record streak reached 15 games with an 85–72 victory over Abilene Christian. Two nights later on \"The Stage\" in Arlington, it ended with a 76–71 loss to Texas–Arlington.\nBilly Tubbs years.\nCoach Tubbs (1976–1980) was the first former player and alumnus to coach the Lamar men's basketball team. Tubbs led the Cardinals to their first NCAA Division I basketball tournament in 1979. The tenth seeded Cardinals upset the number seven seed Detroit before falling to tournament champion Michigan State in the second round. The following year, the Cardinals under Coach Tubbs, had a Cinderella story in the 1980 NCAA basketball tournament as a ten seed advancing to the Sweet 16. The Cardinals defeated number seven seed Weber State and number two seed Oregon State before falling to six seed Clemson.\nCoach Tubbs left the Cardinals after the 1979–1980 season to take the head basketball coach job at Oklahoma. During Tubbs's reign at Lamar he recruited one player, Mike Olliver who would become an all-American for Lamar. One of Coach Tubbs' recruits, Clarence Kea, was drafted by the NBA while Tubbs was still at Lamar. Three other Tubbs recruited players, Mike Olliver, B. B. Davis, and Alvin Brooks, were drafted the year following Tubbs' departure.\nThe 1979 Cardinal Basketball team set records when it beat Portland State University 141–84; at the time, that game set an NCAA record for points in a single game. During the game, Mike Olliver set the single game scoring record at Lamar with 50 points; that record stood until January 4, 2011.\nCoach Tubbs' Cardinals began the 80 game seventh longest NCAA home court winning streak (discussed below) winning the first 31 games.\nPat Foster years.\nPat Foster (1980–1986) was hired to replace Billy Tubbs. Foster came to Lamar as an assistant coach under Eddie Sutton at Arkansas. He continued Lamar's men's basketball success by leading the Cardinals to 3 Southland Conference titles and post season play each of the six years he was head coach at Lamar. Post-season included two (2) NCAA Tournament appearances advancing to the second round in both. The Cardinals also participated in the NIT four (4) times advancing to the second round once. The Cardinals won twenty (20) or more games five of Coach Foster's six seasons at Lamar.

        "text": "A three-point field goal (also known as a \"three-pointer\" or \"3-pointer\") is a field goal in a basketball game, made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. The statistic was first recognized in the 1986–87 season when 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA. From the 1986–87 season through the 2007–08 season, the three-point perimeter was marked at for both men's and women's college basketball. On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's basketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the men's three-point line back to ; the women's line remained at the original distance until it was moved to match the then-current men's distance effective in 2011–12. On June 5, 2019, the NCAA men's rules committee voted to extend the men's three-point line to the FIBA distance of , effective in 2019–20 in Division I and 2020–21 in lower NCAA divisions. The women's line remained at 20 ft 9 in until being moved to the FIBA distance in 2021–22.\nThe all-time leader in three-point field goals made \"and\" attempts is Antoine Davis of Detroit Mercy, who made 588 threes in 1,566 attempts. Only one player in the top 25 all-time earned his way onto this list in only three seasons: Stephen Curry of Davidson played from 2006–07 through 2008–09 but left for the National Basketball Association (NBA) after his junior season. Curry also played in the fewest games (104) out of all of the other players in the top 25 and currently ranks 20th all-time.\nFive players split their collegiate careers at two schools apiece, and two players split their careers among three programs. Keith Veney, who made 409 threes, first played at Lamar before transferring to Marshall; Akeem Richmond (416) started at Rhode Island before transferring to East Carolina; Andrew Rowsey (404) played two seasons apiece at UNC Asheville and Marquette; Kamdyn Curfman (463) started at VMI before spending a graduate season at Marshall; and Max Abmas (512) spent four years at Oral Roberts before one graduate season at Texas. Umoja Gibson (428), meanwhile, started at North Texas before transferring to Oklahoma and later to DePaul. Cameron Tyson (460) played for Idaho, Houston, and Seattle. The player with the highest three-point percentage for his career on this list is Fletcher Magee of Wofford at 43.5%. Damon Lynn of NJIT has the lowest (35.4%).\nAmong the current career leaders, seven have played in more than four seasons: Davis, Kevin Foster, Darius McGhee, Tyson, and Abmas each played in five seasons, while Jordan Bohannon and Gibson each played in six. Normally, the only way for a player to play in more than four NCAA seasons is to qualify for a \"medical redshirt\", officially known by the NCAA as a \"hardship waiver\". To be eligible, a player must have participated in fewer than 30% of his team's games in that season, and cannot have participated in any games in the second half of the season. Also, the NCAA ruled that the 2020–21 season, seriously disrupted by COVID-19, would not count against any player's period of eligibility. Foster benefited from the hardship waiver, Davis and McGhee from the COVID-19 waiver, and Bohannon and Gibson from both waivers."

        "text": "The Israel women's national volleyball team participates in international volleyball competitions and friendly matches. It is governed by the Israel Volleyball Association (IVA). As in any other sports, even though Israel is geographically located in Asia, it competes in European (CEV) competitions. Its best result so far was a fourth place, in the 2010 European League, in Turkey. On September 11, 2010, after losing the first leg of the repechage against Belarus side by 3:2, and beating them by 3:1 at home, the team qualified for the 2011 European Championship after thirty nine years of absence on this competition.\nHistory.\nIn the beginning of the State of Israel, volleyball was one of the sports with regular contests, including women's championships. But because of the 1947–1949 Palestine war, like most of the Israeli sports, volleyball was suspended, in order to help the army in the battlefield.\nThe first time Israel women's national team participated in a prestigious competition, was the 1956 World Championship, in France. The squad was seeded in a group along with the Soviet Union, United States and Luxembourg. Israel finished third in the group, and then went on to dispute from 11th to 17th places, where it got a final 14th, whereas Brazil finished 11th and the Soviet Union claimed the world championship.\nIn 1967, the Israeli national team celebrated her first European Championship. The tournament was held in Istanbul, Turkey, and the team played in the group stages, finishing second, after Turkey and before Sweden and Bulgaria. The next stage, the final round, had the top eight teams in the tournament. There, Israel has achieved two wins and seven losses and finished eighth in the final rankings.\nFour years later, in 1971, the Israeli national team again reached the European Championship finals tournament. The tournament was held in Italy, where the team played the preliminary round, reaching the second place in its group, after Hungary and before England. This second place led to the 7th–12th spots placement games. Israel has achieved one win and suffered four losses in its last appearance on the European championship tournament, finishing 11th.\nProject Selinger.\nIsraeli women's national team in recent years has become a success model for imitation in other Israeli sports. Since the return of Dr. Arie Selinger to the Israeli coach's position, the Israeli team was dubbed \"\"Project Selinger\".\" The project was launched in the summer of 2007 with the goal of qualifying for the London 2012 Olympics. Special daily trainings were made for the evolution of the team.\nIn the spring of 2010, the Israeli team played in 2011 European Championship qualifier in Group C along with the sides of Ukraine, United Kingdom and Slovakia. The first two stages, when Israel played Ukraine and Great Britain, finished in second place, with four wins and two losses. Not qualifying directly, the Israelis had to dispute playoff games to define the last spots. On the playoffs, Israel had to face Belarus in two matches. After losing in Minsk on September 4, by 3:2 (19–25, 18–25, 25–18, 27–25, 15–13), a week later, in Ra'anana, Israel came back for a 3:1 win (25–22, 16–25, 25–20, 26–24) in front of 1,500 spectators, giving them the spot for the final round of the 2011 competition, after thirty nine years since they last took part on the finals.\nIn June 2010 women's team began the campaign debut in the European League. Israel has been inserted to Group B together with Turkey, Spain and Greece at the end the group stage, qualified for four major teams tournament held in late July 2010 in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. Losing by 3:0 to Serbia and 3:0 to Turkey, Israel got the fourth place of the league, its best result so far in any tournament."

The event was won by Dunc Gray of Australia, the nation's first victory in the men's track time trial. Gray was the first man to win two medals in the event, adding the gold to his 1928 bronze. Jacques van Egmond gave the Netherlands its second consecutive silver medal in the event. Charles Rampelberg of France took bronze, the nation's first medal since 1896 (36 years but only two appearances of the event before).\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and 1928. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. The only returning cyclist from 1928 was bronze medalist Dunc Gray of Australia. Gray had the flu shortly before the competition, but received a \"miracle drug\" from his coach containing brandy.\nMexico and the United States each made their debut in the men's track time trial. France and Great Britain each made their third appearance, having competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Each cyclist raced one kilometre from a standing start.\nRecords.\nThe following was the Olympic record prior to the competition.\nDunc Gray set the new Olympic record at 1:13.0. The top five cyclists all beat the old record."

Golf equipment include balls, tees, gloves, apart from fashion accessories such as hats and wallets.\n\"Early recognition of Penfold's ability came when the solid guttie ball was standard. The gutta then used for balls was often dirty gray, full of foreign particles and none too easy to find on the imperfect fairways of that day. Then, when a leading authority made the statement in his presence that white gutta-percha would make a fortune for the inventor, Penfold spent an intensive period in the laboratory. A pure white gutta-percha was his initial contribution to golf.\"\nThe Royal and Ancient had a ball made which they believed would set a limit to the distance potentialities of all golf balls. Penfold and other ball manufacturers were called in and shown the specifications of the new ball which was supposed to be the perfect 'restrictor.' During the inspection Penfold startled the assembly making the quiet statement that he could build a ball to those very specifications that would out drive any ball then made.\n\"The first test of the Penfold production was held on a Sunday prior to a British Open Championship on a course near St. Andrews. When the selected Driver hit the first Penfold designed ball it carried far beyond the furthermost markers. Other Penfold balls gave identical results. Examination followed the demonstration, and the Penfold test ball was found to conform to the letter of the restricting specification.\"\nA.E. Penfold began his career with the Silvertown company where he was involved in golf ball development. In 1919 he joined Dunlop and designed the famous “Maxfli” ball. Penfold left Dunlop in 1927 to form his own company, Golf Ball Developments Ltd, based at Bromford Lane, Ward End, Birmingham.\nIn the early 1930s, Penfold launched his \"Latticed\" ball which was an instant success at home and in export markets.\nPenfold devised a winding technique which permitted extreme tension of the rubber thread and unerring accuracy. The trick in winding was to prevent too many loops of the rubber thread crossing at exactly the same point.\nOn 17 February 1941 A.E. Penfold was lost at sea aboard the Prince Line cargo ship \"Siamese Prince\", which was torpedoed by the off the coast of Ireland.\nThe company continued manufacturing golf balls at Bromford Lane up until the late 1990s, and became an Iconic brand featuring in Ian Fleming's, James Bond story and film \"Goldfinger\". The Penfold Heart golf ball used and identified by 007 became an iconic brand in the world of golf. Following the policies of A.E Penfold manufacturing to high standards, after which the production of golf balls was out sourced to Korea. Nothing remains of the Bromford Lane factory which was sold for redevelopment. Penfold Golf Ltd, continues to market and distribute Penfold branded golf balls, gloves and clothing from its head office in Dudley."

They won the first World Championship organized by FIFA under the Olympic Committee umbrella with true representation from all continents; before then, football in the Olympics comprised only European teams. Uruguay then won the next two World Cups (Jules Rimet Trophy) in which they participated; these tournaments, the 1930 and 1950 FIFA World Cups, were fully independent from the Olympics and employed clear rules distinguishing professional and amateur football players. Since 1924 marked the beginning of true international football competition, organized by FIFA, FIFA recognizes Uruguay as four-time world champions and allows the team to wear four stars on their uniforms during official international football competitions. (Before 1974, the FIFA World Cup was referred to as the Football World Championship, and the nine champions from 1930 to 1970 received replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy.) Uruguay hosted and won the first FIFA World Cup in 1930, beating Argentina 4–2 in the final. They won their second and last title in 1950, upsetting host Brazil 2–1 in the final match. The team have qualified for fourteen World Cups, reaching the second round in ten, the semi-finals five times, and the final twice. They also won the gold medal in Olympic football twice, in 1924 and 1928, before the creation of the World Cup. Uruguay won the 1980 Mundialito, a tournament comprising former World Cup champions hosted in Uruguay to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first World Championship. Uruguay is one of the most successful teams in the world, having won nineteen FIFA official titles: two World Cups, two Olympic Games, and fifteen Copa América championships.\nUruguay refused to participate in 1934 and defend their title because many European nations declined to take part in 1930 held in Uruguay. They also refused to enter in 1938 because FIFA's decision to hold the tournament in France caused outrage in South America where it was believed that the venue would alternate between the two continents."

The tournament began on 7 October 2010, with the final played on 20 May 2011 at Cardiff City Stadium, the day before the 2011 Heineken Cup Final in the same city at Millennium Stadium. A total of 23 teams from six countries participated. The competition began with 20 teams; three more teams that began their seasons in the Heineken Cup parachuted into the knockout stage. Cardiff Blues did not defend their title, as by winning the 2009–10 cup, they qualified for the 2010–11 Heineken Cup, and did not parachute into the Challenge Cup.\nHarlequins claimed the title with a 19–18 win over Stade Français, becoming the first team to win the Challenge Cup three times. The victory also sent Quins into the 2011–12 Heineken Cup.\nTeams.\nThe allocation of teams is as follows:\nSeeding.\nTeams that did not qualify for the 2010–11 Heineken Cup were ordered into four tiers according to the European Rugby Club Ranking. Five pools of four teams were drawn comprising one team from each tier.\nThe brackets show each team's European Rugby Club Ranking at the end of the 2009–10 season.\nPool stage.\nThe draw for the pool stage took place on 9 June 2010.\nKnockout stage.\nSeeding.\nFollowing the end of the pool stage, the 5 pool winners were seeded alongside the top 3 2010–11 Heineken Cup pool runners-up who failed to qualify for the Heineken Cup quarter-finals.\n(HC) Means a team has entered the competition from the Heineken Cup\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were decided based on the above seeding. All game times are local.\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals of both the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup took place after the Pool 6 Heinieken Cup match between London Wasps and Toulouse on 23 January 2011. The draw was conducted in the Sky Sports booth by Ieuan Evans and Jean-Pierre Lux, Chairman of ERC, at Adams Park, High Wycombe.\nIn last season's Challenge Cup, any semi-final that involved a club that started the season in the Challenge Cup and a club that started in the Heineken Cup would be hosted by the club that started in the Challenge Cup. This rule was abandoned for 2010–11; the home club in each semi-final is now determined strictly by the draw.\nFinal.\nThe final of the Amlin Challenge Cup took place at Cardiff City Stadium on 20 May 2011. Harlequins won the trophy for the third time with a 19–18 victory over Stade Francais."

        "title": "Germany at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "This is a record of the men's Germany and West Germany's results at the FIFA World Cup. For Germany's World Cup history, FIFA considers only the teams managed by the German Football Association, comprising three periods: Germany (during Nazi era), West Germany and reunified Germany. The men's Germany national football team is one of the most successful national teams at the FIFA World Cup, winning four titles, earning second-place and third-place finishes four times each and one fourth-place finish. Germany's 12 podium finishes (3rd place or better) in 20 tournaments add up to at least three more than any other nation. In addition, Germany are the only team which has stood on the podium at least once during the completed decades in which at least one tournament was held (1930s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s). Along with Argentina, Brazil and Spain, they are one of the four national teams to win outside their continental confederation, with the title of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in South America. The team qualified for every FIFA World Cup tournament they have entered (20 out of the 22), the second most frequent, and only failed to reach the quarter-finals three times, in 1938, 2018, and 2022. With this, Germany's 8th place or better (quarter-finals) in 17 out of 20 tournaments (85%) ranks highest in FIFA World Cup finals history. It makes Germany the best team in the history of the tournament in terms of final positions, if points were awarded proportionally for a title, runner-up finish, third-place finish, semi-final and quarter-final appearances.\nRecords.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Tournament played fully or partially on home soil  \nFIFA World Cup finals.\n1954 World Cup Final v Hungary.\nOnly 14 days before the final, West Germany played the favoured Hungarian Golden Team in the first round of the tournament and suffered a 3–8 loss, their highest World Cup defeat to this day. In the final, Hungary was up by two goals after only eight minutes, so it came as a surprise that the West German team not only quickly equalized but turned the game around in the 84th minute with a goal scored by Helmut Rahn.\n1966 World Cup Final v England.\nThe strongly contested game between host nation England and West Germany went into extra time after a score of 2-2 after 90 minutes. Geoff Hurst's goal in the 101st minute is one of the most controversial in football history: His shot bounced off the cross-bar onto the ground and back away from the goal. After a brief discussion with the Soviet linesman Tofiq Bahramov, referee Gottfried Dienst awarded the goal. With the West Germans forced to press for the equalizer, Hurst converted a counterattack in the 120th minute and decided the match for England.\n1974 World Cup Final v the Netherlands.\nWest Germany reached the final as host nation in 1974 and were facing their neighbours and rivals from the Netherlands. After an early penalty scored by Johan Neeskens, West Germany turned the game around to win their second World Cup trophy.\n1982 World Cup Final v Italy.\nPaul Breitner became only the third player in World Cup history to have scored in two separate finals, but only after the Italians had already taken a 3–0 lead after 81 minutes.\n1986 World Cup Final v Argentina.\nWith the highest attendance ever at a FIFA World Cup final, West Germany faced Argentina in Mexico City. Although the Argentinian star player Diego Maradona was closely guarded by the West German team, he assisted the decisive 3-2 scored by Jorge Burruchaga, ensuring his country's second World Cup win. Late during the match, three yellow cards were given to Argentinians for time wasting.\n1990 World Cup Final v Argentina.\nFor this re-match of the 1986 Final, Argentina played extremely defensively. Defender Pedro Monzón became the first player ever to receive a red card in a World Cup final, only to be joined by teammate Gustavo Dezotti 22 minutes later. Although West Germany was the dominating side with 23:1 shots, it is fitting that the rough match was decided by a penalty kick taken by Andreas Brehme.\nFranz Beckenbauer achieved the feat to lose and then win a World Cup final each as player (1966, 1974) and manager (1986, 1990).\n2002 World Cup Final v Brazil.\nWith only one goal conceded during the six matches leading up to the final, hopes were on the German defence to withstand Brazil's star quality strikers. Germany's playmaker Michael Ballack was suspended for the final after picking his second yellow card of the tournament in the semi-final against South Korea. Two goals from Ronaldo in the middle of the second half decided the match in favour of the South Americans and ensured their record fifth title.\n2014 World Cup Final v Argentina.\nDespite defeating host country Brazil 7–1, Germany was supported by the home fans due to Brazil's rivalry with Argentina. This record third match-up of two teams in World Cup finals saw good chances for both sides in regular time, but stayed goalless until substitute striker Mario Götze scored during the second half of extra time, in the 113th minute. The fourth title was the first since Germany's reunification in October 1990.\nRecord players.\nLothar Matthäus is the FIFA World Cup's all-time record appearance maker. In addition, along with Antonio Carbajal and Rafael Márquez from Mexico, he is one of the few players to have been fielded in five FIFA World Cups.\nMiroslav Klose, who is only one match behind, also holds the record for most victories at FIFA World Cups (17).\nTop goalscorers.\nSince 2014, Miroslav Klose is the all-time top goalscorer at FIFA World Cup final tournaments. Gerd Müller used to be the holder of that record from 1974 until it was broken by Ronaldo in 2006.\nBy opponent.\nA * indicates national team is now defunct"

        "text": "The Johns Hopkins–Loyola lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between Baltimore City's Johns Hopkins Blue Jays and Loyola Greyhounds. The teams first met in 1939, when Hopkins prevailed with a score of 20–1.\nThe series is known as both the \"Charles Street Massacre\" and the \"Battle of Charles Street,\" depending on the school. Hopkins fans use the term \"Charles Street Massacre\" to refer to the historically lopsided on-field results and its continued dominance in the series. Loyola fans and some media outlets refer to the game using the more neutral sounding \"Battle of Charles Street.\" Johns Hopkins won 31 straight meetings until Loyola finally snapped the streak with a victory of its own in 1994. Both schools' campuses are located adjacent to Charles Street, which runs north-to-south through the city of Baltimore. Both teams maintain similar cross-street series with the Towson Tigers (see Loyola–Towson lacrosse rivalry).\nAfter the Blue Jays' 29th consecutive victory in 1969, Loyola dropped Hopkins from its schedule. Loyola was an NCAA Division II program from 1973 to 1982 when it moved to I, while Johns Hopkins was Division I during that period. Subsequently, there was a 24-year hiatus in the series before its renewal in 1992. \"The Baltimore Sun\" asserted that in the later years before its revival, Johns Hopkins wished to avoid Loyola, as its team had grown significantly more competitive.\nAfter its first victory in 1994, Loyola won again in 1998 and 1999. All three Loyola wins came under the guidance of head coach Dave Cottle. In the 1998 game, the Greyhounds set a school record of eleven consecutive wins by beating Johns Hopkins. Loyola (#1) entered the contest on April 28, 2012 ranked ahead of Hopkins (#10), but lost a 10–9 overtime decision at the Ridley Athletic Complex. This loss was the Greyhounds' only blemish on its first-ever national championship season.\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "text": "The 2003 Cricket World Cup Final was a One Day International (ODI) match played on 23 March 2003 at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. It marked the culmination of the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the eighth edition of the tournament. It was the first time these two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup. For defending champions Australia it was their fifth World Cup final, while for India it was the second after their 1983 victory. Australia won the match by 125 runs to claim the title for the third time.\nBoth teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final. Australia was unbeaten thus far, while India had lost one game—against Australia in the first stage. Australia—led by Ricky Ponting—entered the game as firm favourites. After winning the toss, India captain Sourav Ganguly decided to field first before a crowd of nearly 32,000. The Australian opening pair, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden, added 105 runs in 14 overs. After their dismissals, Ponting (140 not out) and Damien Martyn (88 not out) were involved in a partnership of 234 runs, then an Australian record, and took the total to 359 runs for 2 at the end of the innings. Harbhajan Singh took two of the Australian wickets, conceding 47 runs.\nIn response, India lost their key batsman, Sachin Tendulkar, at the start of the innings. Despite a brief interruption by rain after the 17th over, no time was lost from the game. Once play resumed, India lost wickets at regular intervals. Virender Sehwag top-scored for India with 88 runs, before the team's innings ended for 234 all out in the 40th over. For Australia, Glenn McGrath took three wickets for 52 runs, while Brett Lee and Andrew Symonds claimed two wickets each. Ponting was named man of the match for his 140 not out, and Tendulkar, the tournament's leading run-scorer (675 runs), was awarded the man of the series. The final was Australia's seventeenth successive ODI win, a record, and they were the first team to win three World Cups. Ganguly's decision to bowl first in the match was criticised by journalists and former cricketers.\nBackground.\nFormat.\nThe 2003 Cricket World Cup was the eighth World Cup, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The competition took place between 9February and 23 March 2003, lasting 43 days. Co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, the tournament was the first World Cup to be played in Africa. There were 14 participating teams, the largest number in a World Cup until then. As well as the 10 Test-playing nations, four associate teams took part. Kenya, by virtue of its ODI status, automatically qualified for the tournament; Canada, Namibia and Netherlands—the top three teams of the 2001 ICC Trophy—formed the rest.\nThe structure of the tournament was similar to that of the 1999 World Cup. The 14 countries were separated into two groups of seven; each team played the others in its group once. The most successful three from each group qualified for the Super Sixes stage, a format which was introduced in the 1999 tournament. Each qualifier carried forward their points from the first stage and played one game against each of the three teams from the other group. The top four teams from the Super Sixes qualified for the semi-finals, and the winners of those matches contested the final. A total of 54 matches were played in the tournament.\nThe matches were played according to the standard rules of a One Day International (ODI). Each side batted for a maximum of 50 overs, and fielding restrictions applied for the bowling side. For the first 15 overs only two fielders were allowed outside the infield, and for the rest of the innings four fielders (including a bowler and the wicket-keeper) had to be deployed in the infield. No player was allowed to bowl more than 10 overs in an innings.\nSquads.\nThe Australian Cricket Board announced their squad for the World Cup on 31 December 2002, but several changes were made to the team before the tournament was completed. In January 2003, Shane Watson was ruled out following a stress fracture and was replaced by Ian Harvey. A day before the tournament started, Australia's key spinner Shane Warne was found guilty of using a prohibited diuretic drug during an ODI series held in Australia before the World Cup. He was sent home after he tested positive, and banned from playing for one year. Later, Australia's fast bowler Jason Gillespie was ruled out from the tournament following a tendon injury. Warne and Gillespie were replaced by Nathan Hauritz (on 24 February 2003) and Nathan Bracken (on 5March 2003), respectively. An ongoing dispute between the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Indian players over product endorsements ensured a delay in the announcement of a provisional squad for the World Cup. The BCCI announced the final selection of 15 members on 31 December 2002. Sachin Tendulkar made into the final squad despite three ongoing injuries, including a major one on the ankle.\nHaving won 15 out of their 18 ODIs leading up the start of the tournament, the defending champions Australia were deemed one of the favourites to reach the semi-finals. They had previously won the 1987 and 1999 tournaments. In contrast, some commentators considered it doubtful whether India would qualify for the Super Sixes stage. They had won the competition once, in 1983, but had recently lost an ODI series against West Indies at home, and were defeated heavily in their tour of New Zealand.\nRoute to the final.\nGroup stage.\nAustralia and India were both in Pool A of the competition. Australia won all their matches in the group stage. Except for their win against England, when they recovered from 135 for 8to reach the target of 205 runs, they won all their matches comfortably.\nIndia had a shaky start to the tournament. In their opening match against the Netherlands, they were bowled out for 204 runs. Although they won the game by 68 runs, the team was criticised for failing to bat out their 50 overs. After they were dismissed for 125 runs against Australia and lost the match by nine wickets, angry fans in India burned effigies of the players; Mohammad Kaif's house and Rahul Dravid's car were vandalised. India won all the remaining games of the stage—against Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Namibia and England.\nAustralia, India and Zimbabwe finished the group as the top three teams and qualified for the Super Sixes from Pool A, while Pool B had Sri Lanka, Kenya and New Zealand progress for the next stage.\nSuper Sixes.\nIn the first match of the Super Sixes against Sri Lanka, Australia made 319 runs for five wickets. The Australian captain Ricky Ponting and his deputy, Adam Gilchrist, scored 114 not out and 99 respectively. Sri Lanka in reply managed 223 runs in 47.4 overs. Aravinda de Silva top-scored with 92 while Brett Lee captured three wickets for Australia. In the next match against New Zealand, Shane Bond's six wickets for 23 runs reduced Australia to 84 runs for seven wickets in 27 overs before Michael Bevan and Andrew Bichel took the total to 208 runs. Lee's five wickets for 42 runs helped to bowl New Zealand out for 112 runs, their lowest total in World Cup. Australia won their final game by five wickets after bowling out Kenya for 174 runs.\nAfter losing the toss against Kenya in their first match, India were set a target of 226 runs. Despite an initial collapse, their captain Sourav Ganguly (107 not out) and Yuvraj Singh (58 not out) ensured India's victory. In the next game against Sri Lanka, India made 292 runs; Tendulkar (97) and Sehwag (66) top-scored for the team. Srinath took four wickets as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 109, and India won the match by a margin of 183 runs. In their final match of the stage, India played New Zealand. Zaheer Khan returned career-best figures of four wickets for 42 runs, and New Zealand were dismissed for 146 runs. India lost three wickets for 21 runs, before Dravid, their vice-captain, and Kaif added 129 runs for the fourth wicket and ensured a seven-wicket win. The match marked the seventh consecutive victory for India in the tournament.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first semi-final was played between Australia and Sri Lanka on 18 March at St. George's Park, Port Elizabeth. Australia won the toss and opted to bat first. They managed 212 runs for the loss of 7wickets at the end of 50 overs. Symonds top-scored for the team with 91 not out, while Chaminda Vaas picked up three wickets for Sri Lanka. With 213 runs needed for victory, Sri Lanka lost both the openers after which the play was interrupted by rain. The target was revised to 172 runs from 38.1 overs using the Duckworth–Lewis method, a mathematical formulation used to calculate revised targets for teams batting second in case of matches being interrupted by bad weather or rain. Kumar Sangakkara and Vaas made 47 runs together for the eighth wicket, the highest partnership of the innings, but the team managed to score only 123 runs in the allotted overs. Australia progressed into the final as Sri Lanka fell 48 runs short of the target.\nThe second semi-final was played between India and Kenya on 20 March 2003 at Kingsmead, Durban. Kenya became the first non-Test team to play a World Cup semi-final. India won the toss and made 270 runs for four wickets. Ganguly and Tendulkar made 111 not out and 83 respectively. In reply, Kenya were bowled out for 179 in 46.2 overs. Their captain Steve Tikolo top-scored with 56 runs, while Zaheer Khan took three wickets for 14 runs. Ganguly was adjudged the Man of the match.\nBuild up.\nMany journalists considered Australia, undefeated throughout the tournament, to be favourites in the final. The Indian industrialist Vijay Mallya organised special flights, including a few chartered ones, to transport film actors, politicians and businessmen to Johannesburg; most of these people supported India. Some South African airlines also extended their support to India. The air tickets from Mumbai to Johannesburg were completely sold out immediately after India entered the Super Sixes stage. Although most journalists and analysts favoured Australia, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan believed India were favourites. Former Australia cricketer Greg Chappell complimented Brett Lee: he said, except for Lee, no Australian bowler was a serious threat to the Indian batsmen, and also remarked that the \"duel\" between Lee and Tendulkar would be crucial.\nOn the eve of the match, which would be his 100th ODI as India's captain, Ganguly issued a statement saying his team were honoured to play the World Cup final. He cited India's victories at the 1983 World Cup and the 1985 World Championship of Cricket as his inspirations. Although acknowledging Australia as the best side in the world, he said they were not \"unbeatable\". Australia's main concern was Tendulkar, the tournament's top-scorer, of whom the Indian fans had high expectations. Ponting hinted about the possibility that his bowlers, Lee and Glenn McGrath, had \"special\" plans to restrict him. He also said that in crucial matches his team \"tries to reach another level\".\nAustralia were making their 5th appearance in a World Cup final. Previously, they won finals in 1987 and 1999, and lost in 1975 and 1996. India was appearing in their second World Cup final. They were successful in their only previous final appearance, in 1983, against the West Indies. Before the match, the two teams had faced each other eight times in World Cups; Australia had won six of them. In the 2003 tournament, Australia won all their matches to that point; India's only defeat came in the group stage against Australia. For all the Indian players it was their first World Cup final, whereas six of the Australians had appeared in at least one previous final.\nFinal.\nSummary.\nThe final was played on 23 March 2003 at the Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg. This was the fifth match to be played at the ground in the tournament. The match, watched by a crowd of 31,779, began at 10:00 SAST. Simon Wilde, writing for the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", said the venue was one of the \"most bountiful\" grounds for batsmen. However, on that day the pitch was moist and the outfield was damp as a result of the thunderstorms the previous evening. A short shower that morning forced the ground staff to blow dry air over the pitch. The sky was overcast with a chance of further rainfall. For the umpires—David Shepherd and Steve Bucknor—it was their third World Cup Final. Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden were appointed as the third and fourth umpires, respectively. Former Sri Lankan cricketer Ranjan Madugalle served as the match referee.\nIndia remained unchanged from the side that played the semi-final, while Australia excluded Ian Harvey and brought back Damien Martyn into the side. Ganguly won the toss and elected to field first. Zaheer Khan opened the bowling for India along with Javagal Srinath. The Australian openers scored aggressively from the beginning of the innings as Khan conceded 15 runs in the first over. Gilchrist in particular hit both Khan and Srinath for many runs and reached his 50 from 40 balls. When Ganguly turned to his spin bowlers as early as the tenth over, Gilchrist slowed his scoring rate. In the fourteenth over, when Harbhajan Singh was brought back to bowl, Gilchrist (57 off 48 balls) tried to hit him over the mid-wicket, but was beaten by the ball's extra bounce and caught in the deep by Virender Sehwag. The pair had added 105 runs for the first wicket. Harbhajan struck again in the twentieth over when he dismissed Hayden (37 runs off 54 balls), leaving the score at 125 runs.\nAfter Hayden's departure, Ponting was joined by Martyn, who completed his half-century in 46 balls. Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50 off 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two sixes off Harbhajan and one off Ashish Nehra. The pair added 100 runs off 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came off 29 balls. At the end of the innings, Australia had scored 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting had scored 140 not out (off 121 balls; four fours and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 not out (off 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the 2019 competition, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 extras. Srinath conceded 79 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what was his last international game.\nIndia came out to bat with Tendulkar and Sehwag. McGrath opened the bowling for Australia. Tendulkar hit a boundary off the fourth ball of the over but was dismissed off the next delivery. Ganguly joined Sehwag and the pair scored at a run-a-ball before the former was dismissed by Lee in the tenth over. Kaif, the next man, was dismissed in the same over with the score 46 runs for 3wickets. Dravid and Sehwag scored steadily from then on until the seventeenth over, when rain interrupted play with the score at 103 runs. After play resumed, Ponting brought in Australia's spinners, Brad Hogg and Darren Lehmann. Sehwag was more aggressive against both, hitting Lehmann for three consecutive fours and Hogg for a four and six; Dravid played a secondary role to Sehwag, pushing often for singles. They were dismissed in quick succession after making 122 (off 111 balls) and 77 (off 77 balls) respectively. Following that, India began to lose wickets at regular intervals. Except for Yuvraj Singh (34), Dinesh Mongia (15), Ashish Nehra (25) and Harbhajan Singh (28) the rest of the players were out for single-digit scores. India were bowled out for 234 after 39.4 overs. Australia won the match by 125 runs. It was their second successive World Cup trophy and their third overall. Ponting was declared the Man of the match for his 140 not out.\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1–105 (Gilchrist, 13.6 ov), 2–125 (Hayden, 19.5 ov)\nFall of wickets: 4-1 (Tendulkar, 0.5), 58-2 (S Ganguly, 9.5), 59-3 (M Kaif, 10.3), 147-4 (Sehwag, 23.5), 187-5 (Dravid, 31.5), 208-6 (Yuvraj, 34.5), 209-7 (D Mongia, 35.2), 223-8 (Harbhajan, 37.1), 226-9 (J Srinath, 38.2), 234-10 (Zaheer, 39.2)\nMatch officials\nKey\nAftermath.\nAustralia became the first team to win three World Cups, and registered a record 17 consecutive ODI wins. They also became the third team to win all the matches in a World Cup tournament. Writing for the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", Simon Wilde remarked that Australia would have beaten a Rest of the World XI had they been asked.\nAt the post-match press conference, Ponting said the Indian players showed no signs of winning the match at any point in time. On Australia's win he said, \"It's not that we think we are ahead of the others. It's just the way we play.\" Nevertheless, he complimented both teams by saying India and Australia were the two best teams in the tournament, and that the Indian players deserved to be in the final. Ganguly praised the Australian batsmen and said they played like \"real champions\".\nGanguly's decision to bowl first was criticised by the media: \"The New York Times\", for instance, said it \"backfired horribly\". Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, while denouncing Ganguly's decision, also criticised his idea of going into the match with an unchanged side. He said India should have played their leg spinner Anil Kumble as the ball was \"gripping [in] the surface\". The journalist and former England cricketer Mike Selvey believed Ganguly may have been influenced by the possibility of the Duckworth–Lewis method affecting the result. Indian journalist Boria Majumdar in his book, \"Cricketing Cultures in Conflict\" (2004), remarked about the possibility of Australia losing the rain-interrupted final, if the result were to be decided by this method. Ganguly defended his decision, saying the overcast conditions and moisture in the pitch meant it was favourable to the bowlers, but they failed to use it properly. Ponting said he would have opted to bat first had they won the toss. His teammate Symonds, in an interview later, recalled that India's decision to bowl first gave them an impression that they were not \"confident enough to take the fight\".\nAustralia were rewarded with prize money totaling , while India received $800,000. Tendulkar's aggregate of 675 runs in the tournament fetched him the Man of the series accolade. Ponting's innings of 140 not out was placed among the best innings of the tournament by Rediff, and among the top 10 performances in a World Cup final by the ICC. Tendulkar and Hayden were included among the \"Highest impact World XI\", a World Cup team released by the \"Wisden\" India owned website Impact Index, in February 2015. Srinath, who was then India's leading wicket-taker in ODIs, retired a few months after the competition. The match also marked the end of India coach John Wright's contract. On his request the Board of Control for Cricket in India retained his position in which he continued to serve until 2005."

He won the Grade-3 Tremont Breeders' Cup Stakes, the Grade-1 Champagne Stakes, the Grade-1 Breeders' Cup Juvenile, the Grade-2 Hutcheson Stakes, the Grade-2 Fountain of Youth Stakes and the Grade-1 Florida Derby. Through these wins, he had already defeated most of the field in various races.\nBest Pal also had an impressive resume with multiple wins at the Grade-3 1990 Balboa Stakes, the Grade-2 Del Mar Futurity, the Grade-1 Norfolk Stakes and the Grade-1 Hollywood Futurity. He also finished ahead of Sea Cadet at the 1991 Santa Anita Derby.\nHansel had won the Grade-3 July 1990 Tremont Breeders' Cup Stakes, the Grade-2 September 1990 Arlington-Washington Futurity Stakes, the March 1991 Grade-2 Jim Beam Stakes(where he defeated Wilder Than Ever) and the April 1991 Grade-2 Lexington Stakes.

He was considered an early favorite for the Kentucky Derby, but suffered a foreleg injury and was declared out.\nOlympio, winner of the 1991 Arkansas Derby, who had traded wins with Dinard, was also seen as a possible candidate for the Kentucky Derby. However, his owners decided to skip the race for the 1991 Preakness Stakes, where he finished 7th.\nCahill Road was also seen as a contender after winning the April 1991 Wood Memorial Stakes, but injured his left front leg in the victory and was retired."

Sunday Silence completed his two-year-old season with only one victory from three starts and was described as looking like a \"skinny teenager\" from Hancock. Between two and three years old, the colt matured and began his three-year-old season as a front runner for the Kentucky Derby. Sunday Silence won both the San Felipe Stakes and the Santa Anita Derby and anticipation built for the confrontation between Sunday Silence and his competition for the Kentucky Derby, Easy Goer. Sunday Silence's win at the Derby was largely attributed to the muddy track, which Easy Goer was claimed to have not liked. Sunday Silence bested Easy Goer by a win of 2 1/2 lengths."

        "text": "The final of the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup was played on 28 April 2007 at the Kensington Oval, Barbados. Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 53 runs (under the Duckworth–Lewis method) to win their 4th World Cup and 3rd in succession.\nRoad to the final.\nAustralia reached the final by defeating South Africa by 7 wickets, while Sri Lanka reached the final by defeating New Zealand by 81 runs in the semi-finals.\nDetails.\nThis was the first World Cup final to be a repeat – the sides previously met in the 1996 World Cup Final, which Sri Lanka won. Australia has won every World Cup match against Sri Lanka apart from that loss. The match was Sri Lanka's second World Cup final appearance and Australia's sixth, their fourth in a row.\nRicky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Adam Gilchrist's score of 149 – the highest in a World Cup final – helped give Australia an imposing total of 281. Sri Lankan batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya added 116 for the second wicket, before falling with the score at 123 and 145 respectively. Despite the regular loss of wickets, Sri Lanka managed to maintain a run rate of over 6 an over. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the culmination of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted Duckworth-Lewis target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light.\nWhile Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day.

        "title": "Power Snooker",
        "text": "Power Snooker is a cue sport, a variant format of snooker. The sport was conceived in 2010. Its concept was derived from the game of snooker and the game of nine-ball pool, with racks being used and the nine red balls which featured one red and white striped power ball set up in a diamond formation as in nine-ball pool. It was first played in October 2010.\nThe first tournament was played in London in the United Kingdom.\nBarry Hearn, the promoter of World Snooker, stated that Power Snooker is \"designed to be fast and very exciting with its power zones and double points scoring\". Players competed in time-limited based on total points scored, instead of the number of racks won. Power Snooker uses nine red balls which includes one red and white striped power ball. When the power ball is potted a two-minute power play starts and all points scored during this period count as double. The balls are continually re-racked at the end of each rack until the end of the match. Total match play lasts for a fixed 30 minutes, with the winner being the player who has scored the most points overall, irrespective of racks played or won. A 20-second shot clock is imposed on each shot, while additional rules also included a power ball, power plays and power zones which included the scoring of double points, quadruple points and the awarding of an extra 50 bonus points if a century break was made. A time foul carried a penalty of 20 points. if a player committed a foul during a power play or in the power zone the penalty was doubled.\nThe first Power Snooker tournament to be staged was played at The O2 in London on 30 October 2010. Eight players competed for a first prize of £35,000. \nPower Snooker had to receive sanction from the WPBSA to allow their players to take part in the cue sport tournament. It was organised and promoted independently by the Power Snooker Group and not by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) which organise snooker events. Ronnie O'Sullivan won the inaugural tournament.\nA second tournament was played in 2011. This was the last Power Snooker event that was staged.\nBackground.\nInception.\nPower Snooker was created by Rod Gunner and Ed Simons, both producers with backgrounds in the entertainment industry. Gunner had been involved with Michael Flatley's \"Lord of the Dance\", while Simons was co-producer of the film \"The Lawnmower Man\". Boxing promoter Frank Warren, a longtime business partner of Simons, also has a non-controlling stake in Power Snooker.\nAccording to Simons, the pair had \"liked snooker but wanted to create their own game a cue sport which was both fast and exciting\". Gunner stated \"It had struck me for some time that Power Snooker would be a new and exciting transfusion\", and that he took his inspiration from \"seeing how Twenty20 cricket had revitalised cricket\".\nPower Snooker officially launched on 22 July 2010 with former World Champion Ronnie O'Sullivan as the main snooker player endorsement. O'Sullivan said of the new cue sport \"the crowd will love it and the public will enjoy it\".\nRelationship to World Snooker.\nPower Snooker is independent of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, organisers of the World Snooker Championship and other ranking tournaments, and regulators of the professional game. This new cue sport format has however been officially sanctioned by the WPBSA's chief shareholder, Barry Hearn. Simons had stated that he sees Power Snooker as simply being one a new cue sport and he hoped Hearn would approve since he took control of World Snooker, rather than being a threat to the established format of the traditional game or a competitor to WPBSA tournaments.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", Hearn sees Power Snooker as \"an element of [the WPBSA's] ongoing attempt to overhaul the sport and introduce it to new audiences\". Hearn stated on the launch that \"We are 100% behind Power Snooker. In this new time for World Snooker, it is important for us to embrace new formats and new ideas\", stating that he believed it would bring new audiences and fans to snooker. \"The Guardian\" also stated that Hearn believes these new formats will hopefully draw new fans into the traditional form of the sport, and that he compared it to the Prizefighter series he had recently introduced to boxing, and his recent revamp of the Professional Darts Corporation. Hearn has not invested financially in the format, with Simons stating that \"Our feeling is that he'll [Hearn] take a look at the [first tournament], see how it goes, and then we'll have another conversation\".\nFormat.\nGeneral play.\nPower Snooker is played on traditional-sized snooker tables, but with a \"modern design and a bespoke Power Snooker baize\". Unlike traditional snooker, in which are played to a certain number of irrespective of time taken, Power Snooker matches are played for a fixed 30 minute game play period, with the balls being continually re-racked. The winner is the player who has scored more cumulative points by the end of the fixed game play period, with ties settled with a single . The 30 minute game clock is halted between racks. Also unlike traditional Snooker, which uses 15 racked in a triangle shape, Power Snooker matches use just nine red balls racked in a nine ball pool style diamond shape.\nScoring and shot clock.\nPower Snooker is different from traditional snooker. As the person who takes the shot gets to keep their turn at the table as long as two reds hit a after their break off shot. Power Snooker play is kept to a quick pace through the use of a shot clock with all shots having a twenty-second limit. If the player exceeds the shot clock the player is penalised 20 points, and their opponent can resume play, or can elect to let the other player play on. A century break is rewarded with 50 bonus points, and if the player can repeat this in the second consecutive frame, this doubles to 100 points, and in a third consecutive frame, to 200 points. This reward for century breaks was, however, removed in 2011. After a , the opponent gets a \"\" and can resume play from anywhere in the .\nPower Ball, Power Play, and Power Zone.\nPower Snooker uses the concepts of the Power Ball, Power Play, and Power Zone. The Power Ball is dark red and is placed in the centre of the diamond rack, identified by a special logo, and is worth two points. When the Power Ball is potted, a two-minute Power Play period starts, where all points values are doubled. If a shot is missed however, the opponent can also benefit from the remaining Power Play time. The Power Ball changed in 2011 to a red striped ball. On the Power Snooker table, the is known as the Power Zone. Any potted from a shot originating in the Power Zone counts as double points, and if potted during a Power Play, quadruple points. In 2011 this was extended to the as well. If a player during a Power Play or in the Power Zone, their points penalty doubles, and if the foul shot originated in a Power Zone and during a Power Play, the penalty quadruples.\nTournament presentation and audience interaction.\nIn contrast to traditional snooker, in which play occurs in quiet surroundings, with an audience expected to remain silent during shots, Power Snooker aimed \"to encourage audience interaction with the players\", loud music and 'spectacular' theatrical lighting were also a feature. Players also had the option to wear a live microphone during play, \"to facilitate and encourage audience interaction\". According to the creators, the Power Snooker format \"isn't about sitting quietly watching, it's about noise and interaction; we want the audience to feel a part of it and enjoy themselves.\".\nIn order to \"add glamour\" to the Power Snooker tournaments, players are encouraged to wear designer outfits, while the referees were exclusively female and were \"dressed to impress\". Tournaments also featured \"Power Girls\". According to the organisers, \"It was important the girls matched the Power Snooker brand criteria; Power Girls are sexy, sassy and very elegant\".\nReception.\n\"The Guardian\", while reserving judgement on whether the revamped Power Snooker could emulate the success of Twenty20 cricket, pointed out that on the eve of the inaugural tournament the format had yet to find a bookmaker partner, and also drew an unfavourable comparison with the failure of PowerPlay Golf to generate much money. They also described Ronnie O'Sullivan's comments on launching the format, that the current WPBSA organised World Championship was \"really boring\", as being \"not quite a Gerald Ratner moment\", referring to the time when Ratner inadvertently devalued his jewellery business after he publicly criticised his product's value."

Later he was a NSW state selector and representative team manager.\nPre-war.\nBorn in Sydney, Walker was schooled at Sydney Grammar and then joined the Eastern Suburbs club. At aged nineteen, before he had made any state representative appearances, he was selected for the 1912 Australia rugby union tour of Canada and the United States. He played in nine games of the tour, including the sole Test match against the United States which Australia won 12–8. He did not gain state or national selection in the few Tests and touring matches of the 1913 and 1914 Australian seasons.\nHe enlisted late in the 1st AIF late World War I joining the 1st Light Horse from the 4th General Service Reinforcement.

With no Queensland Rugby Union administration or competition in place from 1919 to 1929, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of their fixtures of 1920s played against full international opposition were decreed by the Australian Rugby Union in 1986 as official Test matches. Thus Walker's fifteen Waratahs' appearances against international sides from 1920, including the eleven when he captained the side, were all later decreed as Tests. Walker took over the Waratahs captaincy from the first match against the visiting South Africans in 1921 at the Sydney Showground and led the side in all three Tests.\nWalaker captained the Waratahs on their 1921 tour of New Zealand playing in eight games of the tour and the sole Test in Christchurch.

His international debut was made during the Wallabies 1913 tour of New Zealand captained by Larry Dwyer. Thompson played in all three Tests of the tour. In 1914 the All Blacks came to Australia and again Thompson played in all three Tests, twice as number 8 and once at flanker. His rugby career ended with the start of World War I with a tally of six international rugby caps for Australia.\nHe enlisted in Sydney in the AIF in January 1915 six months after war was declared, citing his occupation as carpenter. He embarked as a Private with the 13th Battalion (3rd reinforcement) from Sydney on 11 February 1915 on board the \"HMAT A49 Seang Choon\". He saw active service at Gallipoli and was there killed in action on 29 May 1915. He is buried in the Shrapnel Valley Cemetery at Gallipoli."

        "text": "AMF Bowling 2004 is a video game developed by Black Market Games and published by Mud Duck Productions exclusively for the Xbox in the US on December 1, 2003. Licensed by AMF Bowling, the game is a simulation of traditional ten-pin bowling, with modes for individual and local multiplayer and tournament play. \"AMF Bowling\" received negative reviews, with critics citing its lack of gameplay features and variety and sub-par presentation of the game's character models and environment design. The game was the first in a series of licensed bowling games published by Mud Duck Productions, succeeded by \"AMF Bowling Pinbusters!\" for the Nintendo Wii and DS in 2007. \nGameplay.\n\"AMF Bowling 2004\" is a simulation of ten-pin bowling over ten frames. Players control the ball using a circular overlay with three regions and a pointer arrow. The player presses the A button four times to start the bowl, determine the power of the bowl, the accuracy of the bowl, and the level of spin. Lanes feature other mechanics, including an oil pattern that determines the level of grip on a lane, influencing how much spin can be applied to a bowl. The game supports a scoreboard and replay controls to view a completed bowl. Players are also able to create and modify the appearance of their own bowler and change the texture, logo, surface and hook of their ball.\n\"AMF Bowling 2004\" supports two modes. In 'Open Bowling' mode, players can complete a regular local game with up to three human or computer opponents, a team game in groups of competitors, or a practice mode in which pins can be removed during frames. In 'Tournament' mode, players complete in rounds against 8, 16, or 32 competitors, either in a match play mode with bowlers eliminated in head-to-head rounds, or a shootout mode where players where eliminations are decided in groups of three, with the top two players facing off to determine the winner.\nReception.\n\"AMF Bowling 2004\" received a negative reception from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic stating the game received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" with an average score of 48% across six reviews. Critics were mixed on the merits of the bowling gameplay. Hilary Goldstein of \"IGN\" praised the physics as \"good as they can get in a bowling game\", but found the core gameplay \"bare bones\" and \"boring\". Similarly, Alex Navarro of \"GameSpot\" praised the game's \"realistic delivery\", but found the game \"isn't much fun\" due to the game's \"complete and utter lack of variety...with no rule variations\", also critiquing the game's poor explanation of mechanics, stating \"oil patterns and aiming marks may be true to life, but they aren't exactly intuitive...the game never really explains how these elements come into play.\" However, Russ Garbutt of \"Xbox Nation\" found the game to be \"fun\", stating \"the ball, pin and lane physics are as spot-on as the developers claim they are.\" Dale Nardozzi of \"Team Xbox\" stated the game was \"stripped down\" and \"fails on pretty much every gameplay level\", finding the lack of options led to a \"purely score-based game\" with no unlockable features or motivation to play.\nSeveral critics dismissed the visual presentation and sparse design of the game. Writing for \"IGN\", Hilary Goldstein critiqued the game as having \"no frills, weak animations, terrible character models, and a lack of visual pop\". Similarly, Alex Navarro of \"GameSpot\" stated the game's \"graphics and sound leave quite a lot to be desired\", dismissing the bowler models as \"a complete joke, with badly shaped bodies and no real detail to speak of\", and finding the \"remaining set pieces and components (to be) pretty low-res and generally not nice to look at\". Russ Garbutt of \"Xbox Nation\" stated \"the title does very little to impress...the flashy balls and pins are artistically rendered, but these are last-generation graphics.\" Dale Nardozzi of \"Team Xbox\" dismissed the graphics as a \"full-frontal insult\", disliking the \"poor animations\", \"sheer lack of detail\", and \"terrible\" surrounding details."

It goes more for the flash-in-the-pan presentation rather than on the gameplay, where it struggles completely by being merely nothing at all. Had more emphasis been on the actual bowling, its physics, and the fun of multiplayer, we would be getting somewhere. As is, the game's just a flash-in-the-pan cheaper title that even bowling zealots should avoid. Just do the real thing instead\" \nIGN gave the game a 2 of 10 stating \"With graphics and sound that do nothing to enhance the package, AMF Xtreme Bowling 2006 isn't just a gutter ball, it's tossing a shot seven lanes over and crashing it through the floor\"\nJon Miller of IGN listed the game at number 9 of his personal favorite games of 2006."

        "text": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball tournament is a single-elimination tournament for men's college basketball teams in the United States. It determines the champion of Division I, the top level of play in the NCAA, and the media often describes the winner as the national champion of college basketball. The NCAA Tournament has been held annually since 1939, except for 2020, when it was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Its field grew from eight teams in the beginning to sixty-five teams by 2001; as of 2011, sixty-eight teams take part in the tournament. Teams can gain invitations by winning a conference championship or receiving an at-large bid from a 10-person committee. The semifinals of the tournament are known as the Final Four and are held in a different city each year, along with the championship game; Indianapolis, the city where the NCAA is based, will host the Final Four every five years until 2040. Each winning university receives a rectangular, gold-plated trophy made of wood.\nThe first NCAA tournament was organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46–33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event was given to the NCAA. In the early years of the tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New York City-based event. Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did so—Utah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950—won the NCAA Tournament. The 1949–50 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat. By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events, and in 1971 the NCAA barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited to the NCAA Tournament. The 2013 championship won by Louisville was the first men's basketball national title to ever be vacated by the NCAA after the school and its coach at the time, Rick Pitino, were implicated in a 2015 sex scandal involving recruits.\nThe University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has been the most successful college in the NCAA Tournament, winning 11 national titles. Ten of those championships came during a 12-year stretch from 1964 to 1975. UCLA also holds the record for the most consecutive championships, winning seven in a row from 1967 to 1973. Kentucky has the second-most titles, with eight. North Carolina and Connecticut tie for third with six championships each, while Duke and Indiana follow with five each. Connecticut is the most recent champion, with consecutive wins against San Diego State in the final of the 2023 tournament and Purdue in 2024. Among head coaches, John Wooden is the all-time leader with 10 championships; he coached UCLA during their period of success in the 1960s and 1970s. Duke's Mike Krzyzewski is second all-time with five titles.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

This is aptly named as Sunny Side is located on the north side of the river. During the summer the water warms up to around 24-25°C (75-77°F), so the river is visited by swimmers, kayakers and fishermen.\nHistory.\nBolted routes started being set during the late eighties / early nineties. Nanaimo River is not, and has never been, a developed or maintained park.\nSunny Side.\nGetting there.\nDriving north past the Nanaimo Airport, take the first right off the #1 highway onto Nanaimo River Road. This road will pass under the highway, and cross over railroad tracks. Continue until major power lines pass over head. This is where you park. Walk under the power lines to the south. The trail will fork into three: the first right will take you to the top of the cliffs, the second right will take you down some steps to the bottom of the cliffs, and the final path continues to the left and takes you to the swimming area.\nClimbs.\nThere are several cliff faces on the Sunny Side. The First Cliffs are literally the first set of cliffs you pass when approaching from the stairs. The Upper Deck is the higher portion of the cliffs that can either be approached from the top via the first path turning off. The Lower Deck is directly underneath the Upper Deck, and can either be approached by a rappel, or by scrambling over rocks from an approach path between the first cliffs, and the Upper Deck."

        "text": "The Northamptonshire Women's cricket team is the women's representative cricket team for the English historic county of Northamptonshire. They play their home games at various grounds across the county, including Dolben Cricket Ground, Finedon and Northampton Road, Brixworth. They are captained by Patricia Hankins. In 2019, they played in Division Three of the final season of the Women's County Championship, and have since competed in the Women's Twenty20 Cup. They are partnered with the regional side Sunrisers.\nHistory.\nNorthamptonshire Women joined the national women's cricket structure in 2001, playing in the Emerging Counties competition: prior to this, they had only played one-off games, combined with other county sides. They were promoted from the Emerging Counties league in 2002, and after this moved between Division Three of the Women's County Championship, and the County Challenge Cup, the tier below the Championship. In 2008, Northamptonshire were promoted from Division 5 Midlands, after which they were a consistent Division 4 and Division 3 side. In 2009, they also joined the Women's Twenty20 Cup for its inaugural season, and consistently competed in the lower tiers of the competition.\n2017 was Northamptonshire's most successful year, seeing them promoted in both the Championship and the T20 Cup, from Division 3 to Division 2. They lost only one game all season across both competitions, and were promoted in the Championship by beating Durham in a play-off by 5 wickets. Northamptonshire batter Alicia Presland was the 7th highest run-scorer across the Twenty20 Cup, with 224 runs.\nNorthamptonshire were relegated in both competitions the following season, 2018, however. In 2019, they bounced back, again topping their division in both competitions. However, due to a restructure of women's cricket, there was no promotion in 2019, with the County Championship being discontinued and the 2021 Women's Twenty20 Cup being regionalised. In 2021, they competed in the East Midlands Group of the Twenty20 Cup, but finished bottom with one victory. In 2022, they finished top of Group 5 of the 2022 Women's Twenty20 Cup, but lost in the final to Leicestershire. They also joined the East of England Women's County Championship in 2022, finishing fourth out of seven in their first season. They won their regional group of the 2023 Women's Twenty20 Cup, defeating Hertfordshire in the final, and finished fourth in the East of England Women's County Championship that same season.\nPlayers.\nNotable players.\nPlayers who have played for Northamptonshire and played internationally are listed below, in order of first international appearance (given in brackets):"

        "title": "Boxing (1981 video game)",
        "text": "Boxing is a multiplayer sports video game written by Tom Loughry and published by Mattel Electronics for its Intellivision video game system in 1981. The game simulates a 15-round boxing match with the goal of knocking out the opponent; at the time of the game's release a real-life professional boxing match may have lasted up to 15 rounds.\nGameplay.\n\"Boxing\" allows each player to select one of six boxers, each with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. To start the game one must select a fighting speed by pushing the numbers one, two or three on the keypad or the directional disc. The #3 is the slowest speed, #2 is medium speed, #1 is medium fast and the directional disc is the fastest. Once a desirable speed has been selected then one must choose a boxer. The #1 blue boxer has strong defensive skills while the #2 red boxer has strong offensive power. The #3 tan boxer has strong endurance, and the #4 and #5 the dark green and light green boxers each have a balanced skill set. The #6 yellow boxer is considered \"unpredictable,\" and will be given a random set of abilities by the computer. All boxers are right handed and the players may not choose the same boxer. After the selections are made, the two boxers are placed within a simulated boxing ring and the match begins. Each round of the match lasts 90 seconds in simulated time; compared to three minutes in real life.\nPlayer 1 always faces towards the right, while Player 2 always faces to the left. Using the controller's directional pad, players can move their boxers closer to or away from their opponent in order to throw punches. Punches are thrown using the keypad on the controller. Punches using the boxer's left arm are thrown using the keys on the left side of the pad, and punches using the right arm are mapped to the keys on the right side. There are four types of punches used: a feint punch, a head punch, a chest punch and a stomach punch. The keys in the middle allow the player to duck or to pull his punches.\nA player wins the match if they are able to knock out the opposing boxer, either with a single punch or if the boxer is unable to get to his feet within ten seconds. The computer determines if a boxer is able to continue. If no knockout occurs, the round winner is determined by points. Players score points each time a punch is landed successfully, with the player who scored the most points winning that round. If neither player is knocked out by the end of the fifteenth round, the player that has the most cumulative points is named the winner. A \"double knockdown\" is possible but it is extremely rare to have a \"double knockout\" which results in a draw.\nLegacy.\n\"Boxing\" has been re-released in the \"Intellivision Lives!\" compilation and on Microsoft's \"Game Room\" service in May 2010."

        "title": "Surfing the Void",
        "text": "Surfing the Void is the second studio album by British indie rock band Klaxons, released on 23 August 2010 through Polydor Records. The album was produced by Ross Robinson, and was recorded in Los Angeles, California. The album was preceded by lead single \"Echoes\" on 16 August.\nFollowing the release of the band's Mercury Prize-winning debut \"Myths of the Near Future\" in 2007, Klaxons began working on their second effort the following year. The band returned to working with original producer James Ford, aiming for release in early 2009. In March 2009, it was reported that the band had been told to re-record parts of their second album, with initial efforts rejected by Polydor for being \"too experimental for release\". The album was eventually recorded between November 2009 and February 2010 with producer Ross Robinson.\n\"Surfing the Void\" reached number ten on the UK Albums Chart, as well as multiple charts worldwide. The album marked Klaxons' first entry into the Australian market at the time, debuting at number 15 on the ARIA Charts. Critical reception to the album was generally favourable, with many reviewers commenting on the band's progression from their debut.\nProduction and recording.\nIn July 2007, bassist and vocalist Jamie Reynolds stated that the band were to begin writing parts of their second album individually, aiming to compile at the conclusion of their then-current touring schedule. Reynolds would go on to describe the work as a \"prog doom\" album. Later in the year during the band's November–December tour of the United Kingdom, Simon Taylor-Davis told \"NME\" that the band were currently playing an untitled prog track during soundcheck. Later in the year, the band confirmed they were heading to France to record with James Ford, aiming to be completed by Christmas for release in early 2009.\nIn March 2009, it was reported that the band had been told to re-record parts of their second album, after it was rejected by label Polydor. \nReynolds said that \"...we've made a really dense, psychedelic record\" and that \"it isn't the right thing for us [the band]\". In an interview with BBC News, Reynolds revealed that \"Moonhead\" and new track \"Marble Fields and the Hydrolight Head of Delusion\" were \"probably going to make it\", and that they were working with \"Simian Mobile Disco production\" during April–May 2009. Reynolds added that \"Valley of the Calm Trees\" had been retitled \"The Parhelion\", to reflect its lyrical content. James Ford - of Simian Mobile Disco - confirmed working with the band later in the year, stating in an interview with \"Newsbeat\" that they were \"...trying to keep it melodic and vocal because that's one of their great strong points\".\nIt was announced during November 2009 that the band were now working with producer Ross Robinson, with Robinson confirming through his Twitter account. The band stated that work with Ford had gone astray, reaching difficulties with Ford acting as both producer and drummer. Recording was completed to the satisfaction of both band and label in February 2010.\nThe band released some of the material from the original sessions on a free EP titled \"Landmarks of Lunacy\" via their website on 25 December 2010.\nPromotion.\n In October 2008, Klaxons made their live return with a series of gigs in Europe and South America, debuting new tracks \"Valley of the Calm Trees\" and \"Moonhead\". These were the band's first performances since \"NME\"'s Big Gig eight months prior. The band would then join Modular Records's NeverEverLand festival, which toured Australia throughout December 2008. The band made their live return to the United Kingdom at the beginning of 2009, playing a small club show at Madame Jojo's in London. During the set, the band featured new songs \"Imaginary Pleasures\" and \"In Silver Forest\", together with the previously aired \"Moonhead\" and \"Valley of the Calm Trees\".\nOn 22 May 2009, the band announced a one-off show at Coventry's Kasbah nightclub, their only scheduled headline UK performance. The concert, to take place on June 3, sparked rumours that the band may feature at the 2009 Glastonbury Festival. The band supported Blur at their comeback show at the Manchester Evening News Arena on June 26, before playing a surprise set at Glastonbury the following day. The set included further new songs \"Hoodoo Bora\", \"Future Memory\" and \"Echoes\". In addition to Glastonbury, the band featured at numerous other festivals including Bestival, Ibiza Rocks, and headlined the Croatian Hartera festival. In June 2009, Klaxons announced that the release date of the album had been pushed back to early 2010, with Reynolds stating: \"We'd really like to put out the first great record of the 2010s rather than the last great one of this decade.\"\nIn March 2010, it was confirmed that the band would be playing Open'er Festival in Poland as well as the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the United Kingdom, where they are to headline the BBC Radio 1/\"NME\" Stage. Taylor-Davies suggested Reading and Leeds would be a UK-exclusive, saying \"I think in England it's just going to be Reading and Leeds, in terms of festivals, this summer\". The band have also announced an eight date tour of the United Kingdom and France in support of the new album, taking place during May–July 2010. For live performances, they are to be joined by Anthony Rossomando (formerly of Dirty Pretty Things) as a touring member. Further festival performances include Spain's Benicàssim Festival, Pohoda in Slovakia, and EXIT in Serbia.\nArtwork.\nIn January 2011 it was announced that the cover had won a prize for the best album artwork of 2010.\nRelease.\nThe album's title was revealed on 25 May 2010. Zane Lowe premiered the promotional track \"Flashover\" on BBC Radio 1, naming the track his \"Hottest Record in the World\" for 25 May 2010. From 8pm the same day, the track was made available to listen to from the band's website. The album's first official single was announced as \"Echoes\", which was released on 16 August 2010. The track peaked at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Surfing the Void\" entered the UK Albums Chart upon its release, peaking at number ten in the week beginning 29 August 2010. Worldwide, the album reached number fifteen in the Australian ARIA Charts, as well charting on the Irish, Swiss and Belgian (Wallonia) Album Charts. Second single \"Twin Flames\" was released on 25 October 2010.\nReception.\nMedia response to \"Surfing the Void\" was generally favourable, with many professional reviews commented on the band's progression from their debut album. Aggregating website Metacritic reported a normalised rating of 68, based on thirteen positive and ten mixed critical reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews. Dorian Lynskey of \"The Guardian\" awarded the album three stars out of five, applauding the band's efforts to stand out from conventional indie music. BBC reviewer Andy Fyfe noted the band's move away from their new rave labelling, comparing the band favourably to The Prodigy and Depeche Mode. In December 2010, \"Hot Press\" noted: \"Despite being an excellent collection of catchy psych-rock tunes, the record's tortured creation [...] did [Klaxons] no favours and there was a feeling of anti-climax when it finally surfaced late this summer.\"\nTrack listing.\nAll songs composed by Simon Taylor-Davies, James Righton and Jamie Reynolds, except where noted."

North Korea progressed to the second round, thus making them the first Asian country to have qualified past the first round. However, they lost to Portugal in the quarter-finals. Seven players were consistently fielded during these matches.\nNorth Korea was the lowest-ranking team to qualify for the 2010 World Cup and did not pass the group stage after losing in all three group matches.\nNorth Korea had four top goalscorers in 1966, and only one goalscorer in the 2010 World Cup.\nPrior to North Korea's debut in 1966, Korean Empire had entered qualification for the FIFA World Cup in 1930, 1934, and 1938 as part of Japan because Korea was occupied by Japan at that time. In later years, North Korea either withdrew (1970 and 1978), or did not enter or qualify for the World Cup.\nSummary.\n1966 in England.\nAfter South Africa being disqualified and South Korea having withdrawn due to logistical reasons, North Korea had to compete in a play-off match against Australia in order to qualify, which they won 9–2 on aggregate.\nIn the third and decisive group match, North Korea beat title contenders Italy 1–0, eliminating them from the competition and advancing to the second stage.

The Koreans lost their final match against Ivory Coast 0–3 on 25 June. Having lost all three group matches, they were knocked out, finishing at the bottom of Group G. It was reported that the apparent North Korean football fans were actually Chinese people who bought tickets reserved for North Korean government officials.

After a brief stint in the top division in 2000, Sussex became an established Division One side from 2002 onwards, and won their first title in 2003. This began a prosperous era for Sussex Women, going on to be County Champions three times in a row, with victories in 2004 and 2005. Other the next eight seasons, until 2013, Sussex never dropped out of the top 3 of Division One, and recorded three more title wins, in 2008, 2010 and 2013. Key to this success was players such as Rosalie Birch, Alexia Walker and Clare Connor, who were regularly top run-scorers for the side.\nSussex also joined the Women's Twenty20 Cup for its inaugural season in 2009, and qualified for the knockout stages in every season from 2010 to 2013. Sussex won the title in 2012, beating Berkshire by ten wickets in the final: bowling their opponents out for 52, with Sussex bowler Izi Noakes taking 3/5. Sussex went on to win their second T20 title in 2015, topping Division One with six wins from eight games, and finishing ahead of Yorkshire and Kent on Net Run Rate.\nIn recent years, Sussex have struggled to replicate their early success in the County Championship, and were relegated from Division One in 2017. They managed to bounce straight back however, winning Division Two in 2018, and finished 3rd in Division One in 2019. In 2021, they competed in the South East Group of the Twenty20 Cup, finishing 4th with 3 victories, as well as joining the Women's London Championship for its second season, in which they finished 4th out of 5 teams.

        "title": "Viva World Cup",
        "text": "The VIVA World Cup was an international association football tournament organized by the N.F.-Board, an umbrella association for teams unaffiliated with FIFA, held five times between 2006 and 2012.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe oldest precedent of the VIVA World Cup was the Alternative Worldwide Cup of 1988, developed in Jordan.\nInauguration.\nIn April 2005, the NF-Board announced that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus had been chosen to host the inaugural VIVA World Cup, having successfully hosted the KTFF 50th Anniversary Cup, a tournament to celebrate 50 years of the Cyprus Turkish Football Federation, featuring fellow NF-Board member Sápmi and FIFA-unaffiliated Kosovo. The NF-Board hoped that sixteen teams would take part, drawn from across its membership.\nControversy.\nIn spring 2005, the new government elected in the Cyprus Turkish Football Federation (KTFF) was keen to foster relations with other nations. The NF-Board claim that the government of Ferdi Sabit Soyer insisted on restricting which teams could and could not take part in order to head off potential political arguments. For their part, the KTFF claim that the NF-Board made unreasonable financial demands.\nThe upshot of this was that the NF-Board decided to grant the hosting rights for the tournament to Occitania. In response, the KTFF announced that they would hold their own tournament, the ELF Cup, scheduled for the same time as the VIVA World Cup. Some NF-Board members accepted the invitations to take part in the ELF Cup.\nOccitania 2006.\nOccitania announced that the tournament would still be held on 19–25 November 2006, with games played in and around Hyères les Palmiers, near Toulon. The number of entrants was reduced to eight, in anticipation of the ELF Cup (which agreed to pay expenses) drawing NF-Board members away from the VIVA World Cup. A lack of suitable competitors meant that the tournament was to include six teams: Monaco, the Romani, the Sápmi, Southern Cameroons, West Papua, and the Occitania national football teams.\nHowever, the failure of West Papua and Southern Cameroon to attend the NF-Board General Assembly in September 2006, and logistical problems facing the Romani, threw new doubt on the tournament, which looked as though it might go ahead with just three teams. Four teams - twelve fewer than initially hoped for - were set to take part when Southern Cameroons agreed to send a team; unfortunately, they were unable to take part because of visa problems, resulting in walkovers in all their games. By the end of the week, Sápmi had triumphed, scoring 42 goals in their three games, and lifting the first VIVA World Cup trophy, destroying Monaco 21–1 in the final.\nSápmi 2008.\nThe second VIVA World Cup was played in the Swedish town of Gällivare in Sápmi from 7 to 13 July 2008. The matches were played under the midnight sun. Twelve teams had expressed an interest in participating in the men's tournament; however, only five teams took part, and Padania emerged as winners, beating the Aramean team 2-0. The host, Sápmi, finished in third place.\nThe women's tournament had only two teams, and the host, Sapmi, beat Kurdistan.\nPadania 2009.\nPadania was the host for the 2009 edition. The tournament was played in some important stadiums in northern Italy. The final was held in Verona on June 27, 2009, and saw Padania retain the title, defeating Kurdistan 2-0.\nGozo 2010.\nThe Gozitans hosted the tournament at the newly refurbished artificial turf ground of 2009-10 Champions Sannat Lions, as well as the 4,000 capacity Gozo Stadium in Xewkija. From May 31 to June 6, teams from Padania, Kurdistan, Provence, Occitania, Two Sicilies and Gozo competed for the Nelson Mandela Trophy. Only two teams, Gozo and Padania, took part in the women's tournament. The Tibet national football team was looking for sponsors to participate to the VIVA World Cup 2010 but failed to come.\nKurdistan 2012.\nIn December 2009, the NF-Board came to an agreement with the Island Games Association that the VIVA World Cup would be held alternately with the Island Games in a deal that would see the IGA assist the NF-Board in its attempts to provide competition for its members and potential members. As a result of this agreement, the fifth VIVA World Cup was awarded to Kurdistan, to take place in 2012. This tournament had the most participating teams of any Non-FIFA tournament. The hosts beat Northern Cyprus in the final (the first time the latter failed to win a non-FIFA tournament in which they took part).\nTournament results.\n^ \"Withdrew before the start of the tournament due to visa problems.\"\nTrophy.\nThe VIVA World Cup Trophy was designed by French sculptor Gérard Pigault, and is named The Nelson Mandela Trophy, in honour of the former South African president."

        "text": "Turn Back the Clock is the name associated with the promotion by Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises when they wear throwback uniforms. Often, the uniforms signify a special event in the team or regions history. The promotion was originated in 1990 by the Chicago White Sox. Since then, multiple other teams have made it a yearly tradition.\nOrigin.\nIn 1990, the Chicago White Sox set up a \"Turn Back the Clock\" game against the Milwaukee Brewers on July 11. The White Sox dressed in 1917 uniforms, while the Brewers wore their normal uniforms. The promotion was aimed at celebrating Comiskey Park's final season. To set the early baseball atmosphere, ballpark ushers wore dated dress and some had megaphones to announce lineups. Also, ticket prices for general admission were $.50 and all other tickets were half price. The 1917 season was selected because it was the last time (at the time of the promotion) that the White Sox won a World Series. The promotion was considered successful.\nLeague-wide promotion.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies were the second team to hold a TBTC game, June 16,1991 against the Cincinnati Reds. Both teams wore throwback uniforms from the 1957 season. The Baltimore Orioles were the third team to use the marketing strategy after the Chicago White Sox. In that game, against the Minnesota Twins, the Orioles wore attire from the 1966 season and bleacher ticket prices were reduced to $.75. After that, the Chicago Cubs mimicked the promotion in 1992 wearing throwback uniforms. Likewise, the Milwaukee Brewers used the promotion in 1993 by wearing uniforms from the 1920s Milwaukee Brewers. Multiple other teams built off the concept over the seasons (including the wearing of Negro league uniforms).\nA faux-back Turn Back the Clock game was featured on June 30, 2012, featuring the Tampa Bay Rays and the Detroit Tigers wearing uniforms from the season. The Rays, who did not exist as a franchise in 1979 (they were enfranchised in ), wore specially-designed throwback uniforms for the game, using popular design cues of the time such as two-tone caps, colored pants and pullover tops. \n\"Turn Ahead the Clock\".\nIn 1998, the Seattle Mariners marketing team developed a concept off the \"Turn Back the Clock\" promotion. In the \"Turn Ahead the Clock\", the team's uniforms would be transformed into a \"futuristic\" style. The Mariners promotion was successful, and in 1999 it was sold by Major League Baseball to Century 21 Real Estate, who made it into a league-wide marketing campaign. The league-wide promotion proved unsuccessful despite the success seen by the Mariners."

Prior to their win in 2010, Spain's best World Cup result was a fourth-place finish in 1950.\nSpain have reached the semi-finals twice and the quarter-finals six times, but have not reached the last 8 since their triumph in 2010.\n2010 World Cup.\nThe Spanish team went to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as European champions and enjoyed a record unbeaten streak of 35 matches from 2007 to 2009. Although they lost their first match 1–0 against Switzerland, they went on to win the group after victories over Honduras and Chile, while the Swiss failed to win another match and were eliminated.\nThe Spanish team won all three following knockout matches by a score of 1–0, always scoring in the second half of regular time. The opponents were Portugal, Paraguay and Germany.\n2010 World Cup Final v the Netherlands.\nIt was Spain's first and the Netherlands' third appearance in a World Cup final, but neither had ever won a trophy. Spain was the dominating side with 57% ball possession, but the Dutch opponents had several chances as well. In a rough match, referee Howard Webb showed fourteen yellow cards and sent off Dutch defender John Heitinga in the second half of extra time, after regular time ended goalless. However, even with the five yellow cards received in the final, the Spanish team was awarded the FIFA Fair Play Trophy after collecting only eight yellow cards in seven matches.\nThe winning goal was scored by Andrés Iniesta, a right foot strike from inside the box after an assist by Cesc Fàbregas.\nRecord players.\nIker Casillas has captained Spain to their World Cup title in 2010 and won the Golden Glove award for best keeper at the same tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\nNo Spanish player has ever won the Golden Boot, but Emilio Butragueño and Spain's record World Cup scorer David Villa have each won the Silver Boot after scoring five goals in 1986 and 2010 respectively."

        "text": "The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially known by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the \"VII Olympic Winter Games\", were a winter multi-sport event held in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from 26 January to 5 February 1956. A total of 821 athletes representing 32 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these Games in 24 events across 8 disciplines. The Olympic program was similar to four years prior, with two new cross-country events added to the competition. Both men and women competed at these Games, though women only contested events in alpine skiing, figure skating, and cross-country skiing. The Soviet Union attempted to secure the inclusion of a women's speed skating event, but this was rejected by the IOC at its 49th session in Athens in 1954. Women would compete in speed skating four years later at the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics.\nA total of 131 athletes won medals in Cortina d'Ampezzo. In their Winter Olympic debut, athletes from the Soviet Union won sixteen medals, seven of which were gold. Both medal totals were the most of any NOC at the Games. Two of these seven medals were earned in a single event, the 1500 meters speed skating competition, when two Soviet skaters tied for first place in a world record time. Athletes from Austria and Sweden won the second and third most medals, with 11 and 10 respectively. Of the 32 NOCs that competed in Cortina d'Ampezzo, 13 won at least one medal. Host nation Italy won three medals, all in bobsleigh.\nCross-country skier Sixten Jernberg of Sweden won four medals, and Austrian Toni Sailer won three gold medals in alpine skiing, both of which were the most of any athlete in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Tenley Albright improved on her silver medal from four years prior in Oslo to win the gold medal in ladies figure skating. The Soviet Union won six medals—exactly half of the medals awarded—in speed skating, with two each being won by Yevgeny Grishin and Oleg Goncharenko. Grishin would repeat his performance with golds in the same two events four years later in Squaw Valley.\nMultiple medalists.\nAthletes who won multiple medals during the 1956 Winter Olympics are listed below."

        "title": "Cycling in Minnesota",
        "text": "Cycling in Minnesota is a popular form of recreation, commuting, and competitive sport that has grown in prominence over the years. It has been a popular activity in the state since the late 19th century.\nMinnesota offers an expansive network of cycling routes and bike-friendly amenities. The state has developed a variety of cycling paths, including urban routes, long-distance trails, and mountain biking terrains. Cycling in Minnesota is supported by an active community of cyclists, advocacy groups, and public initiatives aimed at improving cycling infrastructure and safety.\nMinnesota was ranked as the 2nd most bicycle-friendly state by the League of American Bicyclists in 2017. Much of the state's bicycle culture is centered in Minneapolis, the state's largest city, but the extensive network of trails has helped make cycling common throughout the state.\nHistory.\nBicycles were a popular means of personal transportation in the U.S. and Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries before the automobile became more widely available. As in many other states, bicyclists in Minnesota were early backers of the Good Roads Movement. Cyclists also formed clubs to gather and hold competitions. In the 1890s, Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis became home to a mile-long cycling track that was used for racing. Minneapolis was already building an extensive park system during this time, which was built upon during succeeding generations—including a significant amount of help during the Great Depression when the Civilian Conservation Corps made improvements. Today, a nearly continuous system of parkways, bike paths, and pedestrian walkways encircle the city as the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. Other cities, particularly Twin Cities suburbs have also built large networks of bike paths, but it's an idea that has spread to other places such as Rochester, which has about as much park land as Minneapolis despite having a significantly smaller population.\nCycling gained new life during the bike boom of the 1960s and 1970s. During this period, many bike shops in Minnesota were established, including Penn Cycle in Richfield, which became the first dealer for Trek bicycles in the late 1970s. Erik's Bike Shop, another Richfield-based chain, opened its first store in 1977. Minnesota capitalized on its rich railroading history by transforming half of the state's abandoned rail lines into cycling trails. The Heartland State Trail, opened in 1977, was Minnesota's first paved rail trail. \nTrail building in the state has continued rapidly since then, with various organizations including the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), counties, cities, and non-profits contributing to the development. Many of these trails are multi-use, accommodating activities like hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking, as well as wintertime activities like skiing and snowmobiling. Notably, trails like the Root River Trail have revitalized small towns by promoting tourism.\nDuring the 1980s, Minneapolis became the home of the Rollerblade company, which popularized inline skating. Inline skaters benefited from the smoothly paved trails, and the activity became part of the state's recreational landscape. In the same decade, cyclist Greg LeMond, who had moved to Minnesota, became the first American to win the Tour de France, doing so three times in 1986, 1989, and 1990.\nIn the mid-1990s, the Yellow Bike Coalition formed in the Twin Cities and initiated one of the region's first bike-sharing programs. Despite initial enthusiasm, the program eventually folded due to vandalism and theft. Some supporters of this initiative later established the Sibley Bike Depot, a non-profit community bike shop, in Saint Paul in 2001. A more successful bike-sharing program, Nice Ride Minnesota, began in 2010 but faced financial challenges in the wake of competing scooter-sharing services. The program was eventually shut down in 2023 when Lyft, which had taken over its operations, lost its sponsorship with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota.\nGeography and trails.\nUrban cycling.\nCities like Minneapolis and St. Paul offer extensive bike lanes, cycling programs, and bike-sharing systems. Minneapolis, in particular, has been consistently ranked as one of the most bike-friendly cities in the United States.\nLong-distance trails.\nMinnesota offers several long-distance trails. Trails have been built by many different organizations across the state. While the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) operates a system of State Trails, counties, cities, and non-profit organizations have also worked to build bike paths. Most trails operated by the DNR are multi-use trails, supporting a range of activities including hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and wintertime activities like skiing and snowmobiling. Minneapolis was also home to the Rollerblade company, which popularized inline skating in the 1980s.\nSome of the popular cycle routes include:\nFor off-road enthusiasts, destinations like the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area offer challenging terrains and are known for their mountain biking trails.\nUnited States Bicycle Route System.\nThe United States Bicycle Route System, a national network using existing roads and trails, is in its early planning stages in Minnesota. According to an April 2010 plan by the Adventure Cycling Association, five U.S. Bicycle Routes are anticipated to pass through the state, all converging in the Twin Cities region. These include three east–west corridors: U.S. Bicycle Route 10 (USBR 10), U.S. Bicycle Route 20 (USBR 20), and U.S. U.S. Bicycle Route 30 (USBR 30). Additionally, two north–south corridors are designated: U.S. Bicycle Route 41 (USBR 41) and U.S. Bicycle Route 45 (USBR 45).\nUSBR 45 is expected to largely parallel the present Mississippi River Trail, while USBR 41 is planned to diverge near the Twin Cities, passing through Duluth and extending up the North Shore of Lake Superior. USBR 45 became the first route to receive official designation in Minnesota, achieving this milestone in 2012. Signage for the route was completed in 2013.\nThough planning for these routes in Minnesota had a late start compared to states like Michigan and Wisconsin, the Minnesota Department of Transportation is actively working to integrate these national routes into the state's existing cycling infrastructure."

        "title": "UAAP Season 73 basketball tournaments",
        "text": "The University Athletic Association of the Philippines Season 73 basketball tournaments are the basketball events of UAAP's 2010-11 season. The basketball season began on July 10, 2010 at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City with an opening ceremony hosted by De La Salle University, followed by a couple of men's basketball games. Hosts De La Salle Green Archers defeated the UP Fighting Maroons, and the UST Growling Tigers defeated the UE Red Warriors in the last game of the day.\nAto Badolato, former head coach of the San Beda Red Cubs, was named commissioner for basketball for the 2010 season.\nResults.\nJuniors.\nThe Juniors were the first of the three basketball tournaments to be finished. The Ateneo Blue Eaglets forced the step ladder format, putting themselves directly into the finals. Four other teams battled it out for the one spot left in the finals, with UST triumphing after beating out La Salle, 74–60. Since Ateneo cleared the eliminations, they were given an automatic 1–0 lead in the finals series. However, UST tied it up with a 77–71 win. Ateneo then continued on to sweep the next two games, 76–66 in game 2, and 76–59 in game 3. This was the Juniors' 17th title, and 3rd consecutive championship.\nWomen.\nSecond-seed Adamson Lady Falcons has advanced to the finals with a win over the UST Lady Tigresses, 72–59. However, fourth-seed La Salle Lady Archers edged out first-seed FEU Lady Tamaraws to extend the series, where the winner will advance and face Adamson. FEU won the knockout match to set up a finals showdown with Adamson.\nMen.\nFirst-seed FEU Tamaraws advanced to the finals after beating the De La Salle Green Archers in overtime, 69–59. They faced off against the defending champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who blew past the Adamson Falcons, 68–55. Ateneo started off with an outstanding win, sweeping the Tamaraws by 23 points in game one (72–49), which was the lowest output by a team in the finals since UAAP Season 61, by the same school. The Tamaraws looked ahead for a comeback, being only down by one point, 56–57, in the last 3 minutes of the 4th quarter. However. the Blue Eagles managed to distance, with 2 successive baskets, and a good free throw. FEU scored 3 successful free throws to go up 59–61 against the Ateneans, at the final minute of the championship. However, with a critical hold by Ateneo, Ryan Buenafe pulled off a three-point shot to give Ateneo a 64–59 lead while heading into the final 20 seconds of the game. FEU managed to score just one more three-pointer, but still went down, 62–65. The Ateneo Blue Eagles became the fifth successful team to achieve 3 consecutive championships, and capture their 6th championship title.\nFinals MVP.\nIn Game 2, Ryan Buenafe delivered a season high of 23 points, and a critical three-point shot that lead to the championship. He was named Finals MVP.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nMost games were held at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City and the PhilSports Arena in Pasig, with a single gameday played at Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan.\nWomen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Women's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Women's standings\" /&gt;\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Women's bracket\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Women's bracket\" /&gt;\nJuniors' tournament.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' bracket\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' bracket\" /&gt;\nStepladder semifinals.\n(3) NU vs. (4) DLSZ.\nThis is a single-elimination game.\n(2) UST vs. (4) DLSZ.\nUST has the twice-to-beat advantage, where they only have to win once, while their opponents twice, to progress.\nFinals.\nAteneo has to win two times, while their opponent has to win three times."

        "title": "African nations at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "Association football is the most popular sport in nearly every African country, and thirteen members of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) have competed at the sport's biggest event – the FIFA World Cup.\nResults.\nTeam results by tournament.\nThe team ranking in each tournament is according to FIFA. The rankings, apart from the top four positions (top two in 1930), are not a result of direct competition between the teams; instead, teams eliminated in the same round are ranked by their full results in the tournament.\nFor each tournament, the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown.\nOverall team records.\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws. 3 points per win, 1 point per draw and 0 points per loss.\nAppearances.\nNot qualified.\n41 of the 54 active FIFA and CAF members have never qualified for the final tournament.\nSummary of performance.\nThis table shows for each world cup the number of countries at the World Cup, the number of entries (#E) from around the world (including any rejections and withdrawals), the number of African entries (#A), how many of those African entries withdrew (#A-) before/during qualification or were rejected by FIFA, the African representatives at the World Cup finals, the number of World Cup Qualifiers each African representative had to play to get to the World Cup (#WCQ), the furthest stage they reached, their results, and their coaches.\nPerformance at individual World Cups.\n1930s: Egypt's early appearance.\nThe inaugural 1930 FIFA World Cup was the only one without any qualification process. No African teams entered.\nThe Pharaohs of Egypt were the only African team to apply to feature at the 1934 FIFA World Cup. As there were 32 countries competing for 16 places, FIFA organized the first qualification round. Egypt was placed in a group with Turkey and Palestine, then a British mandate. Turkey withdrew, and Egypt beat Palestine 7–1 in Cairo and 4–1 in Jerusalem to qualify for the World Cup finals.\nThe 1934 FIFA World Cup finals was organized as a straight knock-out. Egypt lost 4–2 to Hungary in Naples with Abdulrahman Fawzi scoring twice to become the first African to score at the World Cup finals. However, a third goal by Fawzi was ruled offside by the Italian referee despite the player having dribbled from the middle of the pitch, and the fourth Hungarian goal involved a scuffle where the Hungarian striker broke the Egyptian goalkeeper's nose with his elbow. The Italian newspapers heavily criticized their referee, but Egypt sailed home and only returned to the World Cup finals 56 years later.\n1938–1966: World Cup without Africa.\nEgypt was the only African country to apply to compete at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, but withdrew before playing any matches.\nNo African countries applied to compete at the 1950 FIFA World Cup.\nEgypt was the only African country to apply to compete at the 1954 World Cup. They were placed in a two-team group with Italy, but lost 1–2 in Cairo and 1–5 in Milan, and thus did not qualify for the World Cup.\nEgypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan all applied to enter the qualification process for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, but Ethiopia's entry was rejected by FIFA.\nEgypt and Sudan competed in an Africa/Asia zone with ten Asian countries for one spot at the World Cup. Egypt progressed to the next round after Cyprus withdrew, but then itself withdrew. Sudan defeated Syria 2–1 on aggregate but eventually withdrew in protest at having to play Israel. (Eventually, the spot originally reserved for Africa and Asia was taken by Wales.)\nSeven African countries entered the qualification process for the 1962 FIFA World Cup : Ghana, United Arab Republic (a joint football association by Egypt and Syria, who were politically united between 1958 and 1961), Ethiopia, Morocco, Nigeria, Sudan and Tunisia. Ethiopia entered through the UEFA qualification process, where it was eliminated by Israel, while the rest entered through the CAF qualification process. Both Sudan and U.A.R. withdrew as FIFA would not allow them to rearrange matches to avoid the monsoon season, so the four teams formed two two-team groups. In the first group, Morocco and Tunisia both beat each other 2–1 at home, and then played a third match at a neutral location (Palermo, Italy) which ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time. Since penalty shootouts were not used by FIFA till the 1970s, Morocco advanced by drawing lots to eliminate Tunisia. Morocco then eliminated Ghana with a draw and a win to proceed to a UEFA/CAF playoff with Spain. They lost both legs of this playoff, meaning that no African nation made it to the World Cup finals for the fifth time in a row.\nSeventeen African countries entered the qualification process for the 1966 FIFA World Cup : Algeria, Cameroon, French Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, and Tunisia. FIFA rejected the application of French Congo, and had already suspended South Africa for apartheid, resulting in their disqualification.\nFIFA's allocation of only one place to three continents (Africa, Asia, Oceania) was subject to significant criticism, especially given the large increase in applications from newly independent African countries. After FIFA confirmed the allocation, the remaining fifteen African nations withdrew in protest.\n1970: Morocco returns Africa to the World Cup.\nFourteen African countries entered the qualification process for the 1970 World Cup : Algeria, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Libya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Senegal, Sudan, Tunisia, Zaire, and Zambia. FIFA rejected the applications of Guinea and Zaire. The Atlas Lions of Morocco played ten matches to qualify for the single CAF spot at the World Cup, advancing along the way past Tunisia by virtue of a coin toss.\nRhodesia, having been expelled from CAF for having a white minority government, entered through the Asia/Oceania qualifying group, where they had to play against Australia in Portuguese-held Mozambique (there was a boycott against playing matches in Rhodesia). The first two matches were drawn, thanks in large part to the excellent Rhodesian goalkeeper Robin Jordan, and the desperate Australians hired a Mozambican sangoma to 'curse' him. In the third match, Jordan was taken off injured after a collision with another player, Australia won 3–1, then refused to pay the sangoma, got 'cursed' by the irate man, and were eliminated two weeks later by Israel. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's CAF expulsion was soon followed by a FIFA expulsion, with Zimbabwe readmitted in 1980.\nAt the 1970 World Cup, Morocco was placed in Group 4 along with West Germany, Peru, and Bulgaria. They lost 1–2 to eventual semi-finalists West Germany, lost 0–3 to Peru, and drew 1–1 with Bulgaria. The two goalscorers were Houmane Jarir (against West Germany) and Maouhoub Ghazouani (against Bulgaria), who were thus the second and third ever African goalscorers at the World Cup. Morocco finished bottom of the group, on goal difference, with one point – the first African point in the World Cup.\n1974: Zaire makes an impression.\n24 African countries entered the qualification process for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, with the Leopards of Zaire eventually qualifying quite comfortably, scoring 18 goals and conceding 5 in the ten matches they played to qualify.\nAt the 1974 FIFA World Cup, Zaire were placed in Group 2 along with Scotland, Yugoslavia (home of Zaire coach and 1970 Morocco coach Blagoje Vidinić), and Brazil. In their first match against Scotland, they impressed with their fast attacking style, and lost just 0–2. Scottish centre-half Jim Holton said after the match \"Let's face it, we underestimated them. For fifteen minutes I wondered what the hell was going on, where the devil had this lot come from, playing stuff like that!\"\nThe next opponents Yugoslavia had noted holes in the Zairean defence, and fully exploited them to hammer Zaire 9–0 in a then record win for World Cup finals, with all but three of their outfield players getting on the scoresheet. Zaire striker Mulamba Ndaye, who was sent off for protesting that a goal by the Yugoslavians was offside, said after the match, \"The management had made off with our match bonuses, and we'd threatened not to play the game. Frankly we'd lost our morale. We could easily have let in 20 goals.\"\nAfter the defeat, the Zairean team were told by the country's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko – who had rewarded the players for qualifying with a house and a car each – not to come home if defending champions Brazil beat them 4–0 or worse. Zaire managed to keep Brazil to merely a 0–3 defeat with Zairean defender Mwepu Ilunga receiving a yellow card for interfering with a free kick. Zaire left the tournament without scoring a goal.\n1978: Tunisia becomes the first African team to win at the World Cup.\n26 African countries entered the qualification process for 1 spot at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. In comparison, 22 Asia/Oceania countries also competed for 1 spot, while 31 European countries competed for 8.5 spots. Les Aigles de Carthage (The Carthage Eagles) of Tunisia eventually qualified, along the way eliminating Morocco in the first ever penalty shootout in World Cup qualification history. This was a major change for Tunisia, who had been eliminated by Morocco quite literally by chance on three previous occasions in the 1960s.\nTunisia were placed in Group 2 with West Germany, Poland, and Mexico. After Zaire's fate in 1974, they were not expected to do well. They were 1–0 down to Mexico at half-time when their Tunisian coach Abdelmajid Chetali told them that they treated their opponents with too much respect and that they could still win the game if they tackled hard and imposed their belief and self-confidence. Buoyed by the pep talk, the North Africans scored three times in the second half to win 3–1 and become the first African team to win a match at the World Cup. They lost their next match to Poland 1–0, missing several chances, and held West Germany to a goalless draw. While this was not enough to progress to the next round, African football pride had been restored.\n1982: Algeria wins twice but eliminated.\nThis was the first World Cup with 24 teams, and Africa's representation was doubled. So 29 African countries competed for 2 spots in World Cup qualification. In comparison, 21 Asian nations also competed for 2 spots, but 33 European nations competed for 13 spots. 1978 finalists Tunisia were eliminated in the first round by Nigeria on penalties. Four series of knockout rounds were played, with the final two spots going down to Nigeria vs Algeria, and Morocco vs Cameroon. Both Les Fennecs\" \"(The Desert Foxes)\" of Algeria and \"Les Lions Indomptables (The Indomitable Lions) of Cameroon won 2–0 away and 2–1 at home and qualified for the World Cup for the first time.\nCameroon were placed in Group 1, where they surprised everyone by remaining undefeated. They drew 0–0 with Peru, 0–0 with Poland, and 1–1 with Italy. Grégoire Mbida scored Cameroon's first World Cup finals goal. Italy had also drawn its three matches, so also had a goal difference of 0, but had scored two goals to Cameroon's one, so Cameroon were eliminated. This was especially painful because in their opening match against Peru, Cameroon striker Roger Milla had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside.\nAlgeria were placed in Group 2 with West Germany, Austria, and Chile. The Africans produced a major upset in the first match, beating West Germany 2–1 with goals by Rabah Madjer and Lakhdar Belloumi. They lost their second match 0–2 to Austria, then produced another surprise by beating Chile 3–2. The day after the Algeria vs Chile match, West Germany and Austria played the final group match in Gijón knowing that a 1–0 or 2–0 win for West Germany would result in both European teams qualifying at the expense of Algeria on goal difference. West Germany scored after ten minutes, and then both teams appeared to pass the ball aimlessly around for the remaining 80 minutes.\nThis performance was widely deplored by all observers. The Spanish crowd shouted, \"Fuera, fuera!\" (\"Out, out!\") while angry Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players to suggest that the game was fixed. Even the two sides' fans were disgusted, with an Austrian television commentator advising viewers to turn off their TV sets, a German television commentator refusing to commentate further, and a German fan burning his national flag in protest. Furious Algerian football officials lodged an official protest, but the two teams denied any collusion. As nothing could be proved and the two teams had technically broken no rules, FIFA allowed the result to stand. FIFA did change the rules – in future World Cups, the final two games in each group are played simultaneously. Thus Algeria were eliminated from the 1982 FIFA World Cup at the first hurdle despite two wins.\n1986: Morocco becomes first African team into the Round of 16.\nAs with 1982, 29 African countries entered the qualification process for two spots at the World Cup. There were four series of knockout rounds, with four Mediterranean countries making the final round. Algeria beat neighbours Tunisia 7–1 on aggregate and becomes the first African team to qualify consecutively for the second time to World Cup. Morocco beat Libya 3–1 on aggregate and also qualified for their second World Cup.\nAlgeria were placed in Group D with Brazil, Spain, and Northern Ireland. They did not reach the heights of its previous finals appearance, drawing 1–1 with Northern Ireland, losing 0–1 to Brazil, and losing 0–3 to Spain.\nMorocco shocked both Poland and England with goalless draws, and then defeated Portugal 3–1 to become the first African team to progress beyond the first round. In the second round, they faced a West German side that had seven survivors from the Disgrace of Gijón match. Goalkeeper Badou Zaki kept Morocco in the game with a series of excellent saves, but was finally beaten in the 87th minute by Gijón substitute Lothar Matthäus. West Germany won 1–0 and went on to reach their second successive final.\n1990: Cameroon's Indomitable Lions reach the Quarter Finals.\n26 African countries entered the qualification process for 2 spots at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. This was the first time African qualification moved from a mostly straight home-away knockout format to include group stages early on. Finally it came down to four teams playing in two playoffs for the final: Algeria vs Egypt and Tunisia vs Cameroon. Cameroon beat Tunisia 2–0 at home and 1–0 away, and qualified for their second World Cup. However, the playoff between the two North African sides was significantly more ill-tempered.\nAfter a goalless draw in Constantine, Egypt beat Algeria 1–0 in Cairo to qualify for the World Cup. After the Cairo match, an Algerian player gouged out an Egyptian team doctor's eye with a broken bottle. The player blamed, Lakhdar Belloumi (who scored the winning goal in Algeria's 2–1 defeat of West Germany in 1982), was not allowed to travel outside Algeria owing to an Interpol international arrest warrant for twenty years until the (financially compensated) Egyptian doctor dropped the charges in 2009. Belloumi always claimed innocence in the incident, with him and other players pointing the finger at Algerian goalkeeper Kamel Kadri instead.\nThere was tragedy during the second round Group C match between Nigeria and Angola on 12 August 1989 at the Lagos National Stadium when 24-year-old Nigerian midfielder (and qualified lawyer) Samuel Okwaraji collapsed and died of congestive heart failure in the 77th minute.\nEgypt were placed in Group F with England, Netherlands, and Ireland. It turned out to be one of the tightest groups in World Cup history, with five draws in six games. Egypt drew 1–1 with the Netherlands, drew 0–0 with Ireland, but lost their final match 0–1 to England. Egypt's only goal of the tournament was a penalty by Magdi Abdelghani against the Netherlands. Egypt were thus eliminated from World Cup, still without a win after losing their only match in 1934.\nCameroon were undoubtedly the surprise package of the tournament. Led by Russian tactician, manager Valery Nepomnyashchy, in their first match, they shocked Diego Maradona's defending champions Argentina 1–0 through a goal by François Omam-Biyik, despite finishing their match with nine men. In their next match, they defeated Romania 2–1 thanks to two goals from 38-year-old substitute Roger Milla. These were Milla's first official goals in the World Cup; he had had a goal against Peru wrongly disallowed for offside during the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Having already qualified for the next round, Cameroon then suffered their first loss (after three draws and two wins) in World Cup history, losing 4–0 to the already eliminated Soviet Union. In the second round, Cameroon defeated Colombia 2–1, with Milla again coming on as a second-half substitute to score twice, famously dispossessing Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita for one of them. By this time, Roger Milla, his post-goal celebrations, and Cameroon had firmly implanted themselves in the global footballing consciousness. In the quarter finals, they were seven minutes from qualifying for the semi-finals when England were awarded a penalty. England won the match 3–2 after extra time, with three of the five goals coming from penalties (1 for Cameroon, 2 for England).\n1994: Zambian air tragedy, Nigeria reaches Round of 16.\n40 African countries entered the qualification process for 3 spots at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The extra spot was awarded after the strong performances of Cameroon and Egypt at Italia 90. However, only 28 played all their matches after FIFA rejected Libya (due to UN sanctions) and 11 other nations withdrew at various stages. There was a new qualification format, with two group stages. The big casualty of the first stage was 1990 finalists Egypt, as crowd trouble in Cairo turned a 2–1 home victory over Zimbabwe into a crucial 0–0 draw when FIFA ordered the match replayed at a neutral location.\nIn the new second stage of qualification were three groups of three, with winners qualifying for the World Cup. The Super Eagles of Nigeria won Group A on goal difference, beating both Ivory Coast and Algeria 4–1 in Lagos. In Group C, Cameroon won the group with 3 wins and a loss away to second placed Zimbabwe, with Guinea coming third.\nIn Group B were Morocco, Senegal, and Zambia. In the first match, Morocco beat Senegal 1–0. In the second match, Zambia were to face Senegal in Dakar. However, the plane carrying the Zambian team crashed en route on 28 April 1993. The crash, attributed to mechanical problems and pilot error, killed all thirty people on board, including nearly the entire football team – 18 players – and coaches, support staff, and plane crew. (The Zambian government had yet to release a report on the investigation of the crash of the military plane even ten years later.) Only two European-based players from the original squad missed the flight – Charles Musonda of Anderlecht, who was injured, and captain Kalusha Bwalya, who was flying in from Europe where he played with PSV Eindhoven. All matches in the group were postponed for a month. Zambia hastily put together a new team, captained by Bwalya, and defeated Morocco 2–1 in Lusaka in the first match with the new team with goals from Kalusha Bwalya and Johnson Bwalya (not related). However, they lost their final group match 0–1 to Morocco in Casablanca and Morocco won Group B by one point. Amazingly, the rebuilt Chipolopolo (Copper Bullets) also went on to reach the finals of the 1994 African Cup of Nations.\nAt the 1994 FIFA World Cup finals in the U.S., Cameroon drew their first game in Group B with eventual semi-finalists Sweden 2–2 and lost their second to eventual winners Brazil 0–3. They were 0–3 down to Russia in their third match when half-time substitute Roger Milla scored in the 46th minute (becoming at 42 the oldest man ever to score at the World Cup finals) and sparked brief hopes of a miracle comeback. However, the final score was a 1–6 loss to Russia, with Oleg Salenko netting a record-breaking five goals in vain. In Group F, Morocco lost its three matches by a goal each, 0–1 to Belgium, 1–2 to Saudi Arabia, and 1–2 to the Netherlands.\nIn Group D, Nigeria thumped eventual semi-finalists Bulgaria 3–0, then fell to a 1–2 loss to Argentina before beating Greece 2–0. Nigeria, Bulgaria, and Argentina all finished on six points and qualified for the second round. In the second round, Nigeria faced Italy. Emmanuel Amuneke scored in the 25th minute, leaving Nigeria with a 1–0 lead two minutes from the next round when Roberto Baggio scored in the 88th minute. Baggio scored again in extra time to send Nigeria home.\nThis was the third successive World Cup where an African team progressed beyond the first stage, after Morocco in 1986 and Cameroon in 1990. This was a major factor in FIFA increasing Africa's allocation from 3 to 5 spots as the World Cup expanded from 24 to 32 four years later.\n1998: Nigeria reaches the Round of 16 again.\n38 African countries entered the qualification process for 5 spots at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the two new spots resulting from the tournament's expansion from 24 to 32 teams. This was the first time that three points, instead of two, were awarded for a win. Burundi won both their first round qualification matches but then had to withdraw due to civil war. Sierra Leone, who they had just eliminated, took their place in the second round, and then became the first nation in World Cup qualifying history to be eliminated twice in the same qualifying campaign. Eventually, Cameroon, Morocco, Nigeria, and Tunisia qualified for the World Cup finals along with newcomers Bafana Bafana of South Africa, who had only been readmitted to FIFA in 1992.\nThe five African teams all took European coaches (three Frenchmen, one Serb, one Pole) to the finals, making it the first time since 1974 that there was no African coach at the World Cup.\nIn Group A, Morocco drew their first match 2–2 with Norway and then lost 0–3 to Brazil. The last two matches in the group were played simultaneously (as they had after the Disgrace of Gijón in 1982) – with ten minutes left, Morocco were leading Scotland 2–0 while Brazil led Norway 1–0. But Norway scored twice in the 83rd and 88th minutes to beat Brazil 2–1. Morocco also scored once more to beat Scotland 3–0, but went home.\nIn Group B, Cameroon drew their first match 1–1 with Austria (the Austrians equalizing in the 90th minute) but then lost 0–3 to Italy. Cameroon could have progressed if they won their final group match against Chile, but they drew 1–1 and went home. During the final match, Cameroon's Rigobert Song became the first man to pick up red cards at two World Cups – he was sent off as a 17-year-old against Brazil in 1994. (The second man to be red carded at two World Cups would be Zinedine Zidane eight years later.)\nIn Group C, South Africa began their debut World Cup finals campaign with a 0–3 loss to hosts and eventual champions France. They then drew 1–1 with Denmark, Benni McCarthy scoring their first World Cup finals goal. They needed to win big in their final match against Saudi Arabia but could only manage a 2–2 draw, giving away two penalties and only managing to equalize late into injury time with their own penalty, taken by brace-scorer Shaun Bartlett.\nIn Group D, Nigeria opened with a 3–2 win over fancied Spain and another 1–0 win over Bulgaria. Having qualified for the next stage, they then lost 1–3 to Paraguay. Both Nigeria and Paraguay qualified for the next stage, with Spain losing out despite thumping Bulgaria 6–1. However, in the Round of 16, Nigeria were beaten 1–4 by Denmark. All Nigeria's six goals in the tournament came from six different players.\nIn Group G, Tunisia lost their first two matches 0–2 to England and 0–1 to Colombia. They then managed to draw 1–1 with Romania, who had won their first two matches and topped the group. Thus Tunisia's second appearance at the World Cup (after 1978) ended in them scoring only one goal, a penalty.\nThus only 2 of Africa's 5 representatives came away with at least one win. However, there was an African representative in the second round for the fourth time in succession.\n2002: Senegal reaches the quarterfinals.\n51 African countries entered the qualification process for five spots at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Four of the five 1998 finalists again made it through, with Les Lions de la Teranga (Teranga Lions) of Senegal replacing Morocco. Senegal and Morocco topped the same qualification group each with four wins, three draws, and a loss, but Senegal had a seven-goal superior goal difference thanks to their 9–0 aggregate thrashings of group minnows Namibia. In contrast, the Namibians had managed to hold Morocco to a goalless draw in Windhoek.\nLike Cameroon 12 years earlier, Senegal started with a shock 1–0 win over the defending champions and went on to reach the quarter finals. In Group A, after beating France 1–0 with a goal from Papa Bouba Diop, they drew 1–1 with eventual group winners Denmark. In their final match against Uruguay, they were leading 3–0 at half-time. In the second half, the South Americans – for whom a win would have them progress at Senegal's expense – scored twice, and then a third time with an 88th-minute penalty kick. Senegal survived the frenetic final minutes of the game to hang on to a 3–3 result. Thus Denmark and Senegal progressed to the next round while former champions Uruguay and France went home. In the Round of 16, a golden goal in extra time (to add to his 37th-minute strike) from Henri Camara took Senegal 2–1 past Sweden after extra time. But in the quarter-finals against Turkey, they were eliminated by a golden goal four minutes into extra time.\nIn Group B, South Africa drew 2–2 with Paraguay with an injury time penalty, then scored their first ever World Cup win by beating Slovenia 1–0. However a 2–3 loss to Spain then sent South Africa home. In Group E, Cameroon drew 1–1 with Republic of Ireland, beat Saudi Arabia 1–0, and then lost 0–2 to Germany. In Group F, Nigeria lost 0–1 to Argentina, lost 1–2 to Sweden, and having been eliminated, held England to a 0–0 draw. In Group H, Tunisia lost 0–2 to Russia, drew 1–1 with Belgium, and lost 0–2 to co-hosts Japan.\nOf Africa's five representatives, three won at least once, but only one progressed beyond the first round. Still, Senegal's surprise run made it the fifth successive time an African nation had made it to the Round of 16, and the second time an African country had reached the quarter finals. Three of the five African nations (South Africa, Nigeria, Tunisia) took a local coach to the World Cup; only one of those three scored a win.\n2006: Ghana reaches the Round of 16.\n51 African countries entered the race for 5 spots at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in a qualification process that doubled as one for the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. In the final qualification round, teams were organized into five groups of six teams, with winners qualifying for the World Cup and the top three for the continental tournament. More matches were needed to qualify – while at both the 1998 and 2002 32-team World Cups, 3 of the 5 African teams played only 6 matches to get to the finals, here 3 of the 5 teams that qualified played 12 matches.\nFour of Africa's five representatives to the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals were debutants, in contrast to 2002 when four of five had appeared at the previous World Cup.\nIn Group 1, Togo beat 2002 World Cup quarterfinalists Senegal by two points. The Black Stars of Ghana won Group 2 by five points while in Group 3, Les Éléphants of Ivory Coast lost both its matches to Cameroon but won the group since Cameroon drew too often. In Group 5, Tunisia won the group one point ahead of 1998 finalists and perennial rivals Morocco. Although Morocco was the only African team (of those who played a match) to remain undefeated, it drew half its matches. In Group 4, Angola and Nigeria both finished with 21 points after 10 matches, with Nigeria having a far superior goal difference thanks largely to scoring five goals against both Algeria and 3rd placed Zimbabwe in their last two matches. However, it had already been decided that head-to-head results were to be used to break such ties in 2006 World Cup Qualification before goal difference. The Palancas Negras (Black Antelopes) of Angola, having beaten Nigeria 2–1 on aggregate, qualified for the World Cup.\nAt the World Cup Finals, Ivory Coast lost its first two Group C matches 1–2 to Argentina and 1–2 to the Netherlands before coming back from 0–2 down to beat Serbia and Montenegro 3–2. In Group D, Angola – the only African team at the finals with a local coach (Luís Oliveira Gonçalves) – lost their first match 0–1 to Portugal, then drew 0–0 with Mexico and 1–1 with Iran. In Group G, Togo made more news off the pitch with disputes over team bonuses causing coach Otto Pfister to walk out on the team until just before the first match and FIFA officials having to step in to stop players threatening to boycott the second match. Togo lost 1–2 to South Korea, lost 0–2 to Switzerland, and 0–2 to eventual finalists France. In Group H, Tunisia drew 2–2 with Saudi Arabia, lost 1–3 to Spain (including an injury time penalty from Fernando Torres), and 0–1 to Ukraine.\nIn Group E, Ghana began with up a 0–2 loss to eventual winners Italy with a 2–0 win over the Czech Republic and a 2–1 win over the U.S. Thus the debutants ensured an African representative in the Round of 16 for the sixth successive World Cup. They lost 3–0 to Brazil in the Round of 16. The match was later alleged to have been fixed, charges immediately denied by the Ghana Football Association.\nWhile for the sixth successive time there was an African team in the Round of 16, Africa remained the only continent (other than Oceania) to never have two teams reach the Round of 16 at the same World Cup.\n2010: Ghana gets to Quarter Final.\nThe 2010 FIFA World Cup was the first time that the FIFA World Cup was staged in Africa, with South Africa being the hosts and thus qualifying automatically, to be a sixth African team in the draw alongside the now-regular five who made it through the qualifying process. Their national team became the first World Cup hosts to get knocked out in the first round, though only on goal difference after a draw with Mexico in their opening match (in which South Africa's Katlego Mphela hit the post in the last minute), then a 3–0 loss to Uruguay followed by a 2–1 win over France (in which Mphela was again unlucky, scoring one of the goals but being denied three more by two fine saves and the woodwork again): Mexico finished second ahead of them by virtue of a smaller loss to Uruguay and a larger win over France. Nigeria, Algeria, Ivory Coast and Cameroon also exited the tournament after the Group stages.\nHowever, Ghana progressed beyond the group stages of the FIFA World Cup for the second time in a row, and defeated the U.S. 2–1 after extra time in the Round of 16, which saw them reach the quarter-finals, becoming the third African nation to do so. In the quarter-finals, they were eliminated by Uruguay. Ghana were defeated by Uruguay on penalties after Luis Suárez controversially handballed on the goal line deep into extra time, denying Ghana an almost certain winning goal. The penalty that followed was missed by Asamoah Gyan. Had Ghana won their quarter final they would have become the very first African nation to progress to the semifinals of the world cup. Of the 32 countries that participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, FIFA ranked Ghana 7th.\n2014: Algeria and Nigeria: 2 African teams to the Round of 16.\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil marked the first time more than one African team went beyond the group stages. While Ghana and Cameroon both collected disappointing results (apart from Ghana's 2–2 draw with later champions Germany, which saw them becoming the only team not to lose against the Germans in the entire tournament) and eventually ended fourth in their group, Ivory Coast were also knocked out in the first round after a last-minute penalty kick against Greece and ended third in Group C, above Japan, whom they had defeated 2–1 in their first match.\nAfrica's pride, however, was saved by both Nigeria and Algeria. The Nigerians kicked off their Group F campaign with a disappointing 0–0 draw against Iran, before eventually defeating debutants Bosnia and Herzegovina 1–0. Stephen Keshi's team went down 3–2 to later finalists Argentina in their final match, leaving them on the brink of elimination, but Iran lost to the Bosnians 3–1 and Nigeria went through to the Round of 16 for the third time in history, after 1998 and 1994.\nAlgeria lost 2–1 to a strong Belgium in their opening match in Group H, a loss which was followed by an unexpected 4–2 victory over the South Korea in Porto Alegre in their second match. In their final Group H encounter, a hard-won 1–1 draw with Russia was enough to send the North Africans through to the next round.\nIn the Round of 16, both African teams fell just short to beat the likes of France (Nigeria) and Germany (Algeria), but the fact that two African nations had reached that far, was a reason to be optimistic about the future of African football.\nDuring the 2014 edition, Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan became Africa's all-time leading topscorer at the FIFA World Cup, having scored 6 goals in 3 World Cups, thus exceeding Cameroon veteran Roger Milla's 5 goals.\n2018: No African teams in the Round of 16 for the first time since 1982.\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia saw early elimination for Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia who all lost their first two group games. Nigeria also lost their first group game against Croatia 2–0, but the team got a win in their second game, over Iceland 2–0, leaving them with a chance if they could get a result against 2014 finalists Argentina. However, they lost the decisive game, Argentina scoring the winner with just four minutes left to win 2–1, and were eliminated after finishing third in Group D.\nSenegal won their opening game against Poland 2–1, and drew their second game against Japan 2-2, leaving them needing a draw in their final game against Colombia to be sure of progressing. However, they went down 0–1, and because Japan lost 0–1 as well, Senegal and Japan were level on points (4), goal difference (+0), goals scored (4) and on the head-to-head result between the teams (2-2). However, they bowed out due to the fair play tiebreaker - the first team ever to be eliminated by this particular tiebreaker method, implemented for the first time that year - having received six yellow cards to Japan's four over the course of the three games, finishing third in Group H, resulting in all African teams being eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1982.\n2022: Morocco's semi-finalists lead African charge in Qatar.\nOut of 54 teams that entered the qualifying competition, Africa's five qualifiers for the World Cup were Senegal, Tunisia, Morocco, Cameroon and Ghana. Ghana's qualification was particularly close: needing to win their last match against South Africa in the second-round group stage, their 1–0 win saw them just pip South Africa on goals scored, the teams being level on goal difference and points. The other nine group winners all won their groups outright on points, to put ten teams into the third round consisting of five two-legged playoffs. And then in Ghana's play-off against Nigeria, both matches were drawn 0-0 and 1-1, but Ghana qualified on away goals. Cameroon also required the away-goals rule against Algeria, and Senegal went through only on a penalty shoot-out against Egypt. Morocco defeated DR Congo, and Tunisia defeated Mali, to complete the third qualification round. All five African teams won at least one match, four of them defeating the group's official top-seed favourites (although this includes hosts Qatar, who were only a \"top seed\" by virtue of being the hosts). Senegal and Morocco in fact were each to score two victories in the group stages (the first time two African teams had achieved this in the same World Cup), en route to qualifying for the second round.\nSenegal, in Group A, had to play Holland in their opening match, giving a good account of themselves but conceding two late goals to lose 2–0. They performed better against the host team Qatar, beating them 3–1, and found themselves in the position of needing to beat Ecuador in their final match to qualify. They duly won 2–1 to finish second in their group behind the Dutch, and set up a second-round tie against England - becoming in the process the first African team to win two matches in the group stage since Nigeria in 1998. Senegal had a couple of good chances early on - Sarr had one shot saved, and spooned another over the bar - but England's Henderson and Kane both scored before half-time, and another was added afterwards by Saka, to preserve their unbeaten record against African nations with a 3–0 win and end Senegal's run.\nTunisia, in Group D, drew their opening match with Denmark 0-0, but then lost 1–0 to Australia and went into their final match needing to beat the current world champions, France and hoping for a draw in the other match. Tunisia scored the upset win that they needed - a late French equalizer being denied for offside - but Australia and Denmark failed to oblige, Australia's victory keeping them in second place ahead of the African team, who finished third in the group.\nMorocco fared better in Group F. Although drawn in a group with Croatia and Belgium, who had come second and third in the previous 2018 FIFA World Cup, they managed a 0–0 draw against Croatia and followed up with a 2–0 victory over Belgium. A draw against group minnows Canada, the latter already mathematically eliminated, would have been enough to qualify for the second stage, and in fact Morocco took a 2–0 lead with half an hour gone. They conceded an own-goal just before half-time, but that was the final goal of the game: Morocco's 2–1 victory was enough not just to qualify but to win the group, thanks to a draw between Belgium and Croatia. Morocco thus became the first African side to go through the group stage unbeaten since Senegal in 2002 (Morocco themselves having also achieved the feat in 1986): and the second African team to take first place in their group twice, following on from Nigeria in 1994 and 1998 and Morocco's own exploits of 1986. Morocco's 7 points (2 wins, 1 draw) was a new African record as well (ahead of Nigeria's achievements in 1994 and 1998)\nThe second-round match against Spain was a dour, defensive affair in which Spain had nearly all the possession but few clear chances at goal, Morocco too had only two shots on target and both were saved. In the last minute of extra time, Sarabia hit the post for Spain: the game went to penalties, and after the first three for each side, Morocco were 2-0 up, all three Spaniards having missed. Morocco's fourth penalty was scored by Hakimi, the player born in Madrid knocking Spain out of the World Cup and sending Morocco to the quarter-finals for the first time. And in the quarter-final, Morocco were to play Portugal - who, like Spain, had the majority of the possession but not many chances, Morocco prepared to sit back and try to counter-attack. A couple of chances thus fell to Youssef En-Nesyri, who missed the first two, but scored just before half-time to give Morocco the lead. Portugal were unable to force an equalizer. Bruno Fernandes hit the post, and both Cristiano Ronaldo's shot and Pepe's late header in injury-time flew wide of the post. Even though the injury-time dismissal of Cheddira for a second bookable offence saw them reduced to ten men, Morocco held on to their 1–0 lead and became the first African nation to reach the semi-finals. Unfortunately, Morocco's fairy tale journey ended as they faltered 2–0 to France in the semi-finals, despite dominating possession and a nearly equal amount of shots to the world champions, and thus Morocco failed to make history as the first African team in the final of a FIFA World Cup. In the third place battle against Croatia, Morocco lost 2–1 to the European opponents and thus, matched the result of South Korea in 2002 as Morocco took a fourth-place finish.\nCameroon fared less well in Group G. A 1–0 defeat against Switzerland was followed by a ding-dong 3–3 draw against Serbia in which Cameroon took the lead but conceded two goals in first-half injury time, to go in trailing at the break: Serbia scored a third before Cameroon rallied and levelled the score, but neither team was able to force a winner. This unfortunately left Cameroon with the tall order of needing a victory against Brazil, who were already qualified as top of the group and made nine changes to give their second-string players a game, and still needing to hope that Switzerland failed to beat Serbia. Surprisingly, Cameroon did in fact beat Brazil with an injury-time winner from Vincent Aboubakar - who received his second yellow card of the game for his over-enthusiastic celebration and was thus red-carded: Cameroon became the first team to beat Brazil in a group-stage match since Norway in 1998, the first African team to beat Brazil in the FIFA World Cup, and also Cameroon's first-ever win since 2002, but it was to no avail since Switzerland beat Serbia 3–2 to hold on to second place and leave Cameroon in third.\nGhana's first two matches, in Group H, saw a lot of goals. Against Portugal, the match was goalless till halfway through the second half, when an incident in the penalty area saw video evidence used to award Portugal a penalty, from which they scored. Ghana equalized shortly afterwards, but then conceded two more quick goals to trail 3–1, pulling back a late goal in the last minute but failing to force an equalizer in injury time, Ghana eventually lost 3–2. In the second match against South Korea, Ghana surged into a 2–0 lead at half-time: South Korea pulled both goals back early in the second half, only for Ghana to score a third shortly afterwards and then withstand Korean pressure to hold on for a 3–2 win. This left them in second place in the group before their final match against Uruguay: a win or a draw would have put them through, and things looked promising when Ghana were awarded an early penalty, which was taken by André Ayew - the only remaining Ghanaian player from the 2010 quarter-final against Uruguay. However, it was saved: then Uruguay scored two goals before half-time. South Korea's injury-time victory over Portugal in the other match, putting them ahead of Uruguay on goals scored, forced both sides to go for broke in the final stages - Uruguay in search of a third to improve their goal difference, Ghana in search of getting some goals back - but neither side was able to put the ball in the net, Uruguay's victory serving only to overtake Ghana for third place and condemn the Africans to last place in the group."

        "text": "The Baseball Assistance Team (B.A.T.) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization affiliated with Major League Baseball. The organization's mission is to \"confidentially support members of the \"Baseball Family\" in need of assistance.\" The baseball family includes former players, both from the Major and Minor Leagues, former Negro leagues and All-American Girls Professional Baseball League players, umpires, scouts, athletic trainers and MLB and MiLB team personnel.\nHistory.\nThe Baseball Assistance Team was founded in 1986 during the term of Commissioner Peter Ueberroth as a way for Major League Baseball and its players to take care of former players who have fallen upon hard times. Eligibility for help from B.A.T. has since been expanded to include those with two years of service as Major League and Minor League front office personnel, umpires, scouts, Minor League players, athletic trainers, former Negro leagues players, women from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, former Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) employees, and their widows, widowers, and children under the age of 23. B.A.T. has expanded its efforts into Latin America where they have provided help to players from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. This organization was founded with the goal of helping members of the \"Baseball Family\" during times of hardship, not as a long-term program but as a bridge to help people become self-sufficient. In 1991, a contribution from Major League Baseball, the MLBPA, and the Freedom Foundation established an endowment for B.A.T. While B.A.T. was not, and is not, meant to be a substitute for a pension or retirement savings, it is able to assist in times of need.\nIn 2018, B.A.T. created a scholarship program for former Major and Minor League players. The program is designed to provide financial assistance in the pursuit of educational and vocational opportunities related to career growth goals.\nFundraising.\nMajor League Baseball provides for the overhead expenses of the Baseball Assistance Team, including salary and travel expenses, which allows all funds raised to be donated to grant recipients. To date, the Baseball Assistance Team has awarded more than $62 million in grants, benefiting more than 10,400 members of the \"Baseball Family\", including current and former, on-field Major &amp; Minor League personnel (players, managers, coaches) as well as scouts, umpires, athletic trainers, Major &amp; Minor League front office personnel, Negro League players, and players from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\nSpring Training Visits.\nThe annual B.A.T. Spring Training Fundraising Tour is another major endeavor for B.A.T. Since 2003, B.A.T. board members, staff, and former applicants, have visited each team in Major League Baseball and solicited donations, all of which are given back to former players and members of the \"Baseball Family\" in need. Through the payroll deduction program, players and coaches can pledge a portion of their salary to B.A.T. which goes directly to the grants. Most importantly, the visits also educate the players to be the eyes and the ears of B.A.T. by notifying the organization about anyone who may be in need of assistance. The teams that donate the most money to B.A.T. are honored each year with the Bobby Murcer Award. The 2023 Bobby Murcer Award recipients are the San Diego Padres and the Chicago White Sox.\nAwards.\nB.A.T. Life Time Achievement Award.\nThe Lifetime Achievement Award B.A.T. Award, The B.A.T. Lifetime Achievement Award recognizes an individual who has dedicated their services for the betterment of individuals and families who are in need of assistance. Past award winners include Michael Weiner, Bob Gibson, Cookie Rojas, Frank Torre, Bob Watson, and Sam McDowell.\nBig B.A.T. / Frank Slocum Award.\nThe Frank Slocum Big B.A.T. Award, named for the first Executive Director of the Baseball Assistance Team, is given to \"an individual or a group of individuals whose exemplary service to B.A.T. has helped provide dignity and self-esteem to members of the \"Baseball Family\".\" Past award winners include Commissioners Bud Selig, Peter Ueberroth and Fay Vincent, as well as Bob Costas, Bob Uecker, John Carter, Jane Clark, Richard McWilliams, Rick White, Phil Laskawy, Slocum Family, Joe Malone, Edward Stack, Ozzie Smith, George Brett, the late George M. Steinbrenner, Don Zimmer, Bob Watson, Brad Lidge, Adam Jones, and Jake Peavy.\nBart Giamatti Award.\nThe Bart Giamatti award is given to the \"individual associated with baseball who best exemplifies the compassion demonstrated by the late commissioner.\" Generally, it is given to a player involved in a wide range of charity work, benefiting both those involved with the game of baseball and those in the community at large.

        "title": "Golf on ESPN",
        "text": "Golf coverage on ESPN has been a regular feature of the cable sports channels' programming since soon after ESPN's launch in the United States in 1979.\nAlthough ESPN no longer owns any share of the rights to the week-to-week events on the PGA Tour, LPGA Tour, or Champions Tour, it is the cable rightsholder for two of the men's majors as of 2020 — the Masters Tournament (since 2008) and the PGA Championship (since 2020). In both cases, the telecasts are produced in association with CBS Sports (which serves as the U.S. broadcast television rightsholder for both tournaments) and have incorporated talent from the network's own golf telecasts.\nCoverage history since 2010.\n\"Continued from PGA Tour on ABC\"\nPrior to 2007, ESPN and ABC shared some announcers, but the main ABC coverage team did not generally work on ESPN except for events that ABC had weekend rights to, in which case the full ABC team would work on ESPN's weekday telecasts. After losing PGA Tour rights following the 2006 season, what remained of ESPN and ABC's coverage team's merged, as did the production, with all ABC broadcasts being branded as ESPN broadcasts as part of ESPN on ABC. History of the ESPN golf team during the period when some telecasts were still shown on ABC (2007–2009) can be found at the PGA Tour on ABC article.\n2010–present.\nIn 2010, all coverage was moved to ESPN, with highlight presentations being shown on ABC during the afternoons on Open Championship weekend. This meant that in 2010, for regular men's golf, ESPN showed The Masters, the U.S. Open, the Open Championship, and the Ryder Cup.\nESPN revamped its coverage team in 2010 as well. Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger remained the lead booth announcers. Curtis Strange returned as a hole announcer, while Scott Van Pelt moved from the studio host position to become a hole announcer as well. Sean McDonough joined the coverage team as another hole announcer. Andy North, Judy Rankin and Billy Kratzert all returned as on-course reporters. Terry Gannon moved from a hole announcer role to the role of studio host during live coverage, for highlight updates. Tom Weiskopf, who had been a hole announcer, became an analyst for holes Van Pelt was assigned to, and was joined by Peter Alliss in this role for one hour per day at the Open Championship. At the Ryder Cup, Alliss took Van Pelt's place as a hole announcer, while Van Pelt and Weiskopf worked on the studio set. Tom Rinaldi remained the lead interviewer and essayist.\nIn 2011, Olin Browne joined as an additional on-course reporter. Alliss began to only appear as a guest at the Open Championship, still for one hour per day, and still working as Van Pelt's analyst. In 2012, Gannon's role was eliminated and he joined NBC Sports and the Golf Channel.\n2012 would also be ESPN's final Ryder Cup. The network traded its Friday rights to the 2014 event back to NBC for additional Premier League highlights. NBC then signed a rights deal covering the 2016–2030 editions of the event, ending ESPN's chances of a comeback.\nSeveral changes occurred in 2013. Dottie Pepper replaced Browne as an on-course reporter. Weiskopf was moved to a position in which he would appear once during the telecast to discuss the architecture of the course and how it would affect play, as he is a noted course designer. Alliss also had his guest role cut to only Thursday and Friday coverage of the Open Championship. However, his role as an analyst for holes Van Pelt is assigned to is unchanged for those days.\nIn 2015, Weiskopf left to be a studio analyst for Fox Sports' coverage of USGA tournaments.\nFrom 2008–2014, guest analysts were used during the Open Championship, in various roles, usually for a few hours each day scheduled around their own play in the event. Tom Watson fulfilled this role from 2008 to 2010 and David Duval performed this duty from 2011 through 2014.\nThe 2015 Open Championship was the final event covered by the full ESPN/ABC team, nine years after first losing rights to the PGA Tour. Several members of the team did cover one more event, the LPGA's CME Group Tour Championship in December 2015.\nSince 2008, ESPN has carried early-round coverage of the Masters Tournament, which remained the only major professional golf event still carried by ESPN until 2020. This coverage is co-produced by CBS Sports as part of its presentation of the event, and largely features its personalities, joined by an ESPN studio host (initially Mike Tirico before his departure for NBC, and later Scott Van Pelt).\nIn October 2018, it was announced that early-round and weekend morning coverage of the PGA Championship would move from TNT to ESPN beginning 2020, with ESPN+ holding rights to stream supplemental coverage prior to ESPN's broadcast window, and during CBS weekend windows. As with the Masters, the coverage is co-produced by CBS Sports with the involvement of personalities from both networks.\nFor the 2022 PGA Championship, ESPN announced that it would air a secondary broadcast modeled after its \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" broadcasts for \"Monday Night Football\", which will feature ESPN's new lead NFL commentator Joe Buck (in his first on-air appearance at ESPN after leaving Fox—where he had also briefly served as a golf commentator), ESPN golf analyst Michael Collins, and various celebrity guests (such as Buck's NFL partner Troy Aikman, Fred Couples, Ken Griffey Jr., J. J. Watt, and Peyton and Eli Manning—who will produce the broadcast, among others). It will serve as the opening hour of ESPN's coverage for each round of the tournament, after which it will air on ESPN2 (first and second rounds) or ESPN+ (third and final rounds).\nAnnouncers.\nScott Van Pelt is currently the lead golf host for ESPN."

        "title": "Mike Hoffman (ice hockey, born 1989)",
        "text": "Michael Hoffman (born November 24, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey winger for the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the fifth round, 130th overall, by the Ottawa Senators in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Hoffman has also previously played for the Florida Panthers, Montreal Canadiens, and St. Louis Blues.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nHoffman started his junior hockey career with the Kitchener Dutchmen of the Mid-Western Junior Hockey League in 2006–07. earning a rookie of the year nomination. At the end of the 2006–07 season, the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) called him up for two games in the season, and four in the playoffs. At the start of the 2007–08 season, he failed to make the Rangers. Since no OHL team picked him up, he transferred to the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), where he played until 2010.\nHoffman first joined the Gatineau Olympiques of the QMJHL but was released after 19 games. In 2010, Olympiques General Manager Charlie Henry said that Hoffman was \"a good player for us, but he didn't work as hard as he works today.\" The last-place Drummondville Voltigeurs eventually picked him up and he finished the season with 24 goals in 62 games. He was not selected in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, his first year of eligibility. However, he attended the Philadelphia Flyers' training camp on an amateur tryout and was released on September 29.\nHoffman then returned to Drummondville. In the 2008–09 season, he achieved prominence by scoring 52 goals in 62 games with the Voltigeurs, who came from last in the 2007–08 season to win the 2009 QMJHL championship title and a berth in the 2009 Memorial Cup. In Game 7 for the QMJHL championship, Hoffman scored a goal and an assist in Drummondville's 3–2 win over the Shawinigan Cataractes, finishing with 21 goals in 19 games in the playoffs. He was then selected by the Senators 130th overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft at the age of 19. The Senators could have signed him after the Draft as a free agent had he gone unselected, but 14 other NHL teams had shown interest in drafting him, necessitating Ottawa's selection. Hoffman subsequently attended the Senators' development and training camps and played in a pre-season game against the Montreal Canadiens, but was designated for assignment and returned to the QMJHL.\nHoffman played the 2009–10 season, his \"over-age\" season, for the Saint John Sea Dogs, who traded a second-round draft choice to Drummondville for the player. Hoffman recorded 85 points (46 goals, 39 assists) in 56 games. His goal scoring broke the all-time goal single-season scoring record for the Sea Dogs, surpassing Scott Howes' goal total. His point total also placed him third in the QMJHL in goals, tied for second in power-play goals (17) and seventh in overall scoring. Hoffman was also named a First Team QMJHL All-Star, won the League Most Valuable Player trophy, the League Sportsman of the Year trophy and was a finalist for the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Player of the Year award.\nProfessional.\nOttawa Senators.\nIn July 2010, Hoffman attended the Ottawa Senators' development camp, and on July 22, 2010, he signed an entry-level contract with the NHL club. After attending rookie camp and training camp with Ottawa, Hoffman was assigned to the Binghamton Senators, the Senators' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. Hoffman played the majority of the season with Binghamton and was a member of the 2011 Calder Cup-winning team. He also spent time in the ECHL with the Elmira Jackals during the season, Ottawa's second-tier affiliate.\nHoffman returned to Binghamton for the 2011–12 season. He was called up to Ottawa in December 2011 and made his NHL debut on December 23, 2011, against the Carolina Hurricanes; he was held pointless in his debut.\nHoffman was the leading scorer for Binghamton during the 2012–13 season prior to suffering a broken collarbone just before the AHL All-Star Game. He played three games with Ottawa before re-injuring the collarbone and missing the last 12 regular season and first 10 playoff games.\nHoffman began the 2013–14 season in Binghamton. He was recalled to Ottawa on December 2, 2013, after recording 26 points in 21 games, the second-highest point total in the AHL at the time. He was returned to Binghamton, but returned to Ottawa in February 2014 and remained with the team for the final 23 games. In 2014–15, Hoffman played the whole season in Ottawa and his 27 goals led the team. He was selected to play in the NHL All-Star weekend and led all NHL rookies in goals. He finished sixth in voting for the Calder Trophy for NHL rookie of the year.\nFollowing the 2014–15 NHL season Hoffman became a restricted free agent under the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Ottawa Senators made him a qualifying offer to retain his NHL rights and, on July 5, 2015, Hoffman filed for salary arbitration. According to media reports, Hoffman asked for $3.4 million, while the Senators countered with $1.7 million. Hoffman was awarded a one-year $2 million deal, which the Senators accepted. Hoffman became a restricted free agent at the end of the 2015–16 season. On July 27, 2016, he re-signed with the Senators to a four-year, $20.75M deal, thereby avoiding arbitration. On December 16, 2016, Hoffman was suspended for two games for a cross-checking incident on Logan Couture of the San Jose Sharks.\nFiancée harassment controversy.\nOn May 4, 2018, teammate Erik Karlsson's wife, Melinda, filed an order of protection against Hoffman's fiancée, Monika Caryk. The order came in response to a large number of harassing messages directed toward the Karlssons over an extended period of time, allegedly originating from Caryk. The alleged harassment included utilizing multiple fake social media accounts to direct over 1,000 \"negative and derogatory\" comments towards the Karlssons, including comments wishing that someone would injure Erik Karlsson’s legs to end his career, and others wishing Karlsson's wife and her then-unborn child dead. The Karlssons' son was later stillborn.\nDuring a 2018 court deposition, Caryk burst into tears and threatened to leave the room during questioning. She told the court that she and Melinda Karlsson began as friends and that the Karlssons were never outwardly hostile towards her. When asked how the friendship deteriorated, Caryk stated that she became offended after her Facebook and Instagram posts stopped receiving \"likes\" from Melinda Karlsson, and Caryk became more upset when she stopped receiving invitations to team dinners organized for wives and girlfriends of Senators' players. The deposition revealed that wives and girlfriends of several players associated with the Senators and other organizations had contacted Caryk privately before the matter had ever gone public, admonishing her for her continued and increasing hostility towards the Karlssons.\nAlthough the allegations against Caryk remain unproven in a court of law, Hoffman was swiftly traded from Ottawa once the harassment allegations were made public. Senators' goaltender Craig Anderson later hinted that the situation was a factor in his own poor performance and request to be traded after signing a contract extension the season prior. He noted that he felt the situation had been resolved with Hoffman's exit from the team.\nFlorida Panthers.\nOn June 19, 2018, the Senators traded Hoffman, along with Cody Donaghey and a fifth-round pick of the 2020 NHL Entry Draft to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Mikkel Bødker, Julius Bergman, and a sixth-round pick in the 2020 Draft. About two hours later, he was traded to the Florida Panthers together with a seventh-round pick of the 2018 NHL Entry Draft for a fourth-round and fifth-round pick of the 2018 Draft and a second-round pick of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft.\nOn October 13, 2018, Hoffman embarked on a 17–game point streak with the Panthers, scoring 10 goals and 10 assists, breaking the franchise record previously held by Pavel Bure with 13 games in 1999–00. He finished his final season with the Panthers in 2019–20, registering 29 goals and 59 points in 69 games.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nOn December 27, 2020, Hoffman signed a professional tryout agreement with the St. Louis Blues. On January 11, 2021, Hoffman and the Blues officially agreed on a one-year, $4 million contract. In the shortened season, Hoffman tallied 36 points in 52 games. In a top-six scoring role he recorded seven of his goals on the power play, leading the Blues. Hoffman added one goal in four playoff contests against the Colorado Avalanche.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nOn July 28, 2021, Hoffman was signed a three-year, $13.5 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens as an unrestricted free agent. On reporting to training camp, it was found that Hoffman had a knee injury that would cause him to miss up to four weeks. As a result he did not play in any of the team's pre-season games. In his two seasons with the Canadiens, Hoffman scored 15 goals and 35 points in 67 games during the 2021–22 season and 14 goals and 34 points in 64 games in 2022–23. With Montreal, Hoffman was described as a \"one-way player\" lacking defence and a streaky player, elevating his game for short periods. On March 24, 2023 Boston Bruins forward A. J. Greer was suspended by the NHL for one for a cross-check to Hoffman's face. Hoffman was upset with the NHL's inconsistency of Greer's suspension, taking to social media stating that he had received a larger suspension for a less egregious check to the head.\nSan Jose Sharks.\nOn August 6, 2023, Hoffman was initially traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins as part of a three-team trade also involving the San Jose Sharks. San Jose then acquired him from Pittsburgh."

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1893 was the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire had been playing for twenty two years. Derbyshire's matches were not considered to be first class in this season. The club had lost first class status after 1887 and did not regain it until the following year 1894. However many of the players competed for the club earlier or subsequently at first-class level.\n1893 season.\nDerbyshire played sixteen games and apart from two against Cheshire and one against MCC, these were all against future clubs in the County Championship or the touring Australians. They won seven matches and lost six, which was a sufficient prelude to their return to first-class status in the following 1894 season. Sydney Evershed was in his third season as captain. Harry Bagshaw was top scorer. George Davidson topped the bowling.\nWilliam Taylor noted that during Derbyshire's period in exile many fine players wore their colours including S H Evershed, who in captained the eleven with marked ability for many years and the grand veteran, Levi Wright - \"a magnificent batsman and unsurpassed as a fieldsman in the oldfashioned position of square-point\".\nFrank Mycroft made his debut in the season, standing in as wicket-keeper for William Storer who also played for MCC and other teams. Mycroft went on to play three more seasons for Derbyshire. Joseph Ward and Joseph Soult only played in this season for Derbyshire and never achieved first-class status. Soult played just one match while Ward bowled in a useful manner in four matches."

        "text": "Norman Joseph Daniels (March 25, 1907 – May 11, 2009) was an American athlete and coach. He played basketball, football and baseball for the University of Michigan from 1928 to 1932. He served for 39 years as a professor of physical education and coach at Wesleyan University from 1934 to 1973, including 33 years as the school's head baseball coach, 19 years as the head football coach, nine years as the head wrestling coach, three years as the head basketball coach, and two years as the head squash coach. He led the Wesleyan football team to four consecutive undefeated seasons from 1945 to 1948.\nMichigan.\nDaniels was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1907. He attended the University of Michigan where he received nine varsity letters in football, basketball and baseball. He won All-Big Ten and All-America honors in basketball and was the leading scorer for the 1930–31 and 1931–32 Michigan basketball teams with 152 and 148 points, respectively. He also held the second base position for the baseball team, and played at the right end and halfback positions for the football teams from 1929 to 1931. After graduating from Michigan in 1932, Daniels became a teacher and coach at a secondary school in Hillsdale, Michigan.\nWesleyan.\nIn 1934, one of Daniels' coaches from the University of Michigan, Jack Blott, was hired as the head football coach at Wesleyan University. Daniels joined Blott at Wesleyan in 1934 as a physical education instructor and as an assistant football coach responsible for the ends and backs. Daniels remained at Wesleyan for 39 years, holding positions as the head coach of the football, basketball, baseball, wrestling, and squash teams. He was the school's head baseball coach for 33 years (1941 to 1973), the head football coach for 19 years (1945 to 1963), the head wrestling coach for nine years, the head basketball coach for three years (1944 to 1947), and the head squash coach for two years (1948 to 1950). He was named a full professor at Wesleyan in 1948. \nIn his 19 years as the head football coach, Daniels compiled a record of 76–61–10. He led the football team to a 25-game win streak, including four consecutive undefeated seasons from 1945 to 1948. After the 1948 season, Associated Press sports writer Lou Black wrote: \"Want to know who really is the coach of the year? He's mild mannered Norm Daniels, the wizard of Wesleyan.\"\nIn 1959, Daniels traveled with the baseball team on preseason trip to the South. When Daniels was told that a black player, Lenny Moore, could not stay at a hotel in Georgia, Daniels took the team from the hotel. In Florida, an opposing school refused to play Wesleyan unless Moore was removed from the lineup; Daniels pulled his team from the field.\nLater years and honors.\nDaniels retired after the baseball season in 1973. He was named to the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1974.\nDaniels remained active in his later years, serving on the Middletown City Council in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He also drove a van for Kuhn Employment Opportunities, an organization that assists people with disabilities to secure employment.\nOn April 5, 2007, Daniels celebrated his 100th birthday with a party in the lobby of Wesleyan's Freeman Athletic Center. In 2008, Daniels became one of the inaugural inductees into the Wesleyan University Athletics Hall of Fame.\nIn May 2009, Daniels died at age 102 at the Kimberly Hall nursing home in Windsor, Connecticut. He was survived by a daughter, Diana Mahoney, a son, David, 10 grandchildren and 18 great grandchildren. A memorial service was held for Daniels at the South Congregational Church in Middletown, Connecticut, followed by a reception in the Coach Norm Daniels Lobby in the Freeman Athletic Center at Wesleyan."

Near the middle of the period, Eric Staal scored in similar fashion also on the powerplay, assisted by Justin Williams, and Mike Cammalleri.\n9:11 into the second period, Colby Armstrong scored to give the Canadians a 3–0 lead. This goal ended up as the game winner. Finland had some discipline difficulty in the first two periods, taking 6 minutes apiece in penalties in both periods.\nFinland started to bring up the pressure in the last ten minutes. Petri Kontiola scored a nice glove-side goal on Ward with 8:52 left in the third, assisted by Ville Peltonen, to put the Finns on the board. With only 2 minutes left Antti Miettinen scored to bring Finland within one, 3–2. However, only one minute later Rick Nash scored on a skillful breakaway to put the game away, 4–2 final for team Canada.\nThe Canadians were outshot 22–18, but the Canadian goaltender, Cam Ward, kept them in the game as he was solid between the pipes. They also were able to capitalize on the powerplay, which ended up being decisive in the Canadian win."

During the 1960s, Taiwan was not a member of International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), but was affiliated to Table Tennis Federation of Asia (TTFA). China was totally opposite. In 1968, ITTF had decided that only those countries affiliated to ITTF be allowed to gain membership in its continental affiliates.\nTaiwan did not join ITTF because ITTF refused to recognize Taiwan as China while Taiwan was recognized by International Olympic Committee under the name of Republic of China.\nIn February 1971, TTFA delegates thought the ITTF had no powers to dictate terms to the Asian body, and decided to keep Taiwan's membership which had existed since 1957.\nThe decision caused Koji Koto, the president of TTFA, to resign.\nKoji Koto, as the president of Japan Table Tennis Association, later promised China that he would make an effort to withdraw Japan from TTFA and form a new group with Chinese.\nOn May 7, 1972, after 4-day meeting in Beijing, Asian Table Tennis Union (ATTU) was officially formed with 16 member associations: Cambodia, China, DPR Korea, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Syria and Vietnam.\nATTU was officially recognized by International Table Tennis\nFederation as a continental body for Asia at its 33rd Congress in Calcutta, 1975.\nMembers.\nTotal 44 member associations of ATTU are divided into 5 regional groups: (March 2012)\n2 Associate Members affiliated to Oceania Table Tennis Federation (OTTF) and ITTF:&lt;br&gt;\n - Australian Table Tennis Association&lt;br&gt;\n - New Zealand Table Tennis Association Inc\nNot an ATTU member but affiliated to ITTF:&lt;br&gt;\n - East Timor Table Tennis Association\nCompetitions.\na.

Their first year of varsity women's hockey was in 1998–99. The Catamounts were in the ECAC at the Division III level of competition. In 2001–02, the Catamounts moved up to Division I. For the 2005–06 season, the Catamounts moved to Hockey East.\nHistory.\nThe Vermont Catamounts women's ice hockey program was launched in 1995–1996, under head coach Bruce Garrapy.\nDuring the 2003–04 season, Kami Cote of Vermont set an NCAA record for most saves in one season with 1332.\nDuring the 2010–11 season, Roxanne Douville earned consecutive shutouts against No. 9 Providence (Jan. 30) and Maine (Feb. 5) establishing a new program record shutout streak of 164 minutes and 13 seconds. In addition, she became only the second Vermont player to be named to the Hockey East All-Rookie Team.\nThe 2013- 2014 season saw Vermont's best finish, ending the season 18-4-4, and earning fourth place in Hockey East. They won their quarterfinal match-up against Maine with three overtime wins. They advanced to meet Boston College in the semi-finals, losing by a score of 1–3. Catamount head coach Jim Plumer won the Hockey East co-Coach of the Year award and the New England Division I Women's Coach of the Year award.\nIn 2019–2020, sophomore defenceman Maude Poulin-Labelle set the team's record for points by a defenseman in a single season, with 12 goals and 17 assists, for 29 points. Her goals total tied for first among Catamount defensemen. She was Hockey East player of the Week on January 6, 2020. She was nominated for the Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award, and earned a spot on the Hockey East All Star Third Team. The Catamounts started the season on a four-game unbeaten streak, and lost just 2 games in their first 12 matches. They made the Hockey East tournament for the eighth consecutive year, but fell to the eventual tournament winners, the Northeastern Huskies, in the quarterfinals.\nOn November 11, 2020, Hockey East announced the 2020-2021 schedule for men's and women's ice hockey. League play had been postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, which caused the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA women's ice hockey tournament. Beginning on November 20, women's hockey resumes in a round robin format with each team playing 18 games, to determine the regular season champion. Flex weekends are planned to allow for canceled matches to be played as needed.\nDuring the 2021–2022 season, the Catamounts were ranked for the first time in program history at #10 in the USCHO poll on January 31, 2022. They were ranked at #10 in the USA Hockey poll on February 22, 2022, for the first time ever. They also set a program record of 22 wins in a season.\nRoster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nOlympians.\nChelsea Rapin, who played for the team from 2008 to 2012, was a referee for the women's tournament in the 2022 Winter Olympics."

Throughout 1994 &amp; 1995, Willis played five-eighth, but was unable to play more than a dozen games a season.\nWillis is perhaps best remembered for kicking a 48-metre field goal to win a game against the North Sydney Bears in 1996, one of the longest of the modern era. Willis played every game of the 1996 season, and played in the semifinals, which was to be the Magpies last ever semis appearance.\nWillis only played a further 10 games. He later stated his retirement was due to, \"a couple of injuries,\" and not, \"training as hard as I could.\" He was only 24 when he returned to playing local football with Camden. He captain-coached them to a premiership in 2000, scoring a try in what was described as a star performance. He represented Country Seconds that year.\nLater, Willis coached for Greater Southern &amp; the Western Suburbs Magpies SG Ball side."

He was assistant coach of the University of Texas Longhorns men's varsity baseball team from 1989 to 2012.\nAs a player, Harmon batted left-handed and threw right-handed; he stood tall and weighed . He graduated from Eastern Hills High School of Fort Worth, Texas, and The University of Texas at Austin with a degree in marketing. Harmon was a first-round, secondary phase selection of the Kansas City Royals in the June 1970 Major League Baseball draft, and broke into professional baseball at the advanced Double-A level, with the Elmira Pioneers of the Eastern League. In 1972, while a member of the Jacksonville Suns, he set a Southern League record with six hits in an extra-inning game — although he batted only .201 in 209 at bats for Jacksonville that season.\nAlthough he never reached the Major Leagues, Harmon spent all or parts of seven seasons at the Triple-A level, and he finished his career in the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies organizations, batting .254 in 649 games played with 12 home runs and 179 runs batted in. He then coached and managed in the Phillies' organization, where he won the 1979 Northwest League championship, from 1978 through 1981. In 1982, he spent a year at the major-league level as bullpen coach on the staff of Chicago Cubs manager Lee Elia. Like Harmon, Elia was a veteran of the Philadelphia organization brought to Chicago by the team's new general manager, Dallas Green.\nHarmon returned to his native Texas in 1983 as manager of the Double-A Midland Cubs and, after a period in private business, joined the Longhorns' coaching staff in 1989."

With his halves partner Johnathan Thurston having injury issues/problems throughout the majority of the season; he spent time featuring at halfback, taking-on an extra responsible role in-steering and directing the team around the field.\nIn Game 2 of the State of Origin Series, Morgan came off the bench to replace the injured Will Chambers at right-. He would set up the match-winning try to winger Dane Gagai, leading to Johnathan Thurston to kick the winning goal, giving Queensland an 18–16 win to level the series.\nFollowing a season-ending shoulder injury to Thurston, Morgan took over the halfback position for the remainder of the 2017 season.\nLeading into the Origin decider (Game 3 of the 2017 State of Origin Series), he was the leading candidate to play at Five-Eighth (in replacing Johnathan Thurston). Despite this, coach Kevin Walters selected Melbourne Storm player Cameron Munster to play in that Five-Eighth role which resulted Morgan being selected at for the 3rd game of the State of Origin series. This was his first ever start in the position at First Grade level, and his first start in State of Origin. Playing at in the 3rd game (the decider), he produced a fine performance in QLD's 22–6 win over NSW at Suncorp Stadium.\nWith Thurston still injured and out of the action; Morgan continued-on with his fine consistency performance at Halfback, leading into the NRL play-offs. In week 1 of the Final Series, he guided the Cowboys to a tough narrow 15–14 win over the Cronulla Sharks at Allianz Stadium, kicking a field goal in extra-time\n.

Continuing to do his job for the Australia Kangaroos, he earned a spot at Five-eight for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup final against England.\n2018.\nThe 2018 NRL season was a slow start for Morgan, missing the first two games of the season due to injury. After returning from injury he played at Five-Eighth and Fullback, making way for Johnathan Thurston to play Halfback for the Cowboys. He struggled to find the form that he had in 2017 and as a result both he and the Cowboys had a disappointing beginning to the season.\nCome State of Origin, there were doubts Morgan would be picked for the Maroons due to his current form, but was still picked to play off the bench against the NSW Blues in game I. Leading in to game I of State of Origin, Maroons No.1 Billy Slater pulled out of the game because of a hamstring complaint, making way for Morgan to play Fullback. Morgan had a solid game, but still lost 22–12 to the Blues.\nOn returning to the Cowboys it was revealed that Morgan was carrying a groin issue which was restricting his movement and required surgery at the end of the season.

In his first season as captain, Morgan played 20 games, as the Cowboys missed the finals for the second straight year.\n2020.\nAfter playing the first two games of the season, Morgan underwent shoulder surgery during the NRL's 10-week shutdown, ruling him out for up to month ahead of the competition's return on 28 May. He returned from injury in the Cowboys' Round 13 loss to the Gold Coast Titans. In Round 14, he scored two tries in a 30–31 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs. In Round 16, Morgan tore his calf in a loss to the Cronulla Sharks, which ruled him out for the rest of the season.\n2021.\nMorgan returned from his shoulder injury in Round 1 of the 2021 NRL season, a 24–0 loss to the Penrith Panthers. Following the Cowboys' Round 2 loss to the St George Illawarra Dragons, Morgan was indefinitely ruled out due to soreness to his surgically repaired shoulder.\nOn 9 April, Morgan announced his immediate retirement from rugby league due to his injured shoulder.\nPersonal life.\nMorgan and his wife, Brianna, have a daughter named Penelope.\nMorgan's great-grandfather, Duncan McIvor, played for Queensland in 1915, 100 years before Morgan made his debut for Queensland."

        "title": "Rugby union in East Africa",
        "text": "Rugby union in East Africa is almost entirely an amateur sport. It has been played in the three East African nations (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) for more than a century; the first recorded match taking place in 1909, though it was almost certainly being played for several years prior to this. There are many club and school teams, the oldest of which were established in Colonial times.\nThere are three national teams within East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) and also a multinational team (East Africa) that draws its players from these three nations. This team plays games at home against incoming touring sides and also conducts tours to other rugby playing nations (during which they play under the \"Tuskers\" moniker).\nEarly history.\nSeveral universities and Royal Navy ships sent teams to tour East Africa prior to the Second World War.\nThe first was H.M.S. Southampton (1922), closely followed by H.M.S. Colombo (1923) and then (frequently more than once over the next decade) His Majesty's Ships Cairo, Chatham, Effingham and Enterprise. This latter vessel was to provide a lasting memento of its visits by presenting the \"Enterprise Cup\" to the union in 1928; a trophy that has been the object of competition between clubs in the region ever since.\nThe Combined South African Universities toured in 1929 and in 1935 Danie Craven captained Stellenbosch University on a tour of the region.\nThe Unions.\nThe first union in British East Africa was the Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFU-K), founded in August 1921 (although it did not become effective until 1923 with the formation of the first two Nairobi clubs - Nondescripts R.F.C. and Harlequins R.F.C.); it was responsible for the administration of the game throughout Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika which it carried out through various district sub-unions throughout the region.\nIn 1953 the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) was created in order to take over the mantle as the umbrella organisation for rugby in the region. The creation of the RFUEA allowed for the formation of the Tanganyika Rugby Football Union (T.R.F.U.) in 1954 and Uganda Rugby Football Union (U.R.F.U.) in 1955. Each of these were essentially a sub-union of the RFUEA much as the district unions in Kenya were, so the RFU-K was dissolved in 1956 allowing the already existing district unions to deal directly with the RFUEA.\nThe clubs and the rugby playing schools.\nAmong the notable clubs in Uganda is the Kampala Old Boys (founded 1963) popularly known as the KOBS, that plays its home matches at Kampala Rugby Union Football Club and competes in all the national tournaments from seven a side to ten a side and the common fifteen a side competition. The club is the most successful in the country collecting close to 50 trophies in its illustrious history dating back to 1963. The club is currently coached by Fred Mudoola and captained by Brian Odongo, and are the reigning 2013/2014 National League champions. KOBS's current chairman is Mr.Adrian Bukenya.\nThe club has always associated itself with Namilyango College and other rugby playing secondary schools from where it picks talented students who are nurtured to become club and national stalwarts. The club has in the past produced greats such as Yayiro Kasasa, Allan Musoke, Timothy Mudoola, Fred Mudoola, Mike Wandera, Tony Luggya, Victor Kalimugogo, Victor Wadia.\nOther notable clubs in Uganda are Heathens, the second most successful club, Makerere Impis, Black Pirates and Rhinos."

Upon his release, Nolan was signed by the Johnstown Jets for whom he then appeared in only five playoff games before retiring.\nActing career.\nNolan retired from hockey in 1956, but returned to Johnstown, Pennsylvania two decades later in a minor role for the movie \"Slap Shot\".\nNolan assumed the role of Clarence \"Screaming Buffalo\" Swamptown, a player who Chiefs players thought \"was suspended forever\" until he was introduced at the Federal League championship game. In real life, Nolan was not suspended for life - or at all - due to misconduct. Some of the promotional material for \"Slap Shot\", specifically statements made by the Carlson brothers and Dave Hanson, suggested that Nolan had been banned for life from pro hockey \"for some reason.\" Nolan \"was\" investigated for gambling, but was not suspended. If he had been suspended for life as the promotional material stated, he would have been ineligible to work as an official, which he did for a number of years after his retirement.\nPersonal.\nNolan was a full-blooded Ojibwa Indian. He came from a large family of four brothers and five sisters, the son of Clement and Veronica Nolan.\nUpon retiring from the EHL, Nolan returned to Clinton, New York to reside, but eventually came back to the Eastern Hockey League as a linesman who was respected by players. Nolan continued to reside there until his death in 1986."

They met again a year later, in the Ateneo Inmaculada social club, and decided to found the Club de Rugby Ateneo Inmaculada on October 22, 1974. \nThe club was donated of land, located near the Buenos Aires-Santa Fe motorway, by a rich family close to the club and started building rugby pitches and a club house. Until this donation was effective, CRAI moved to different fields to play its home games: Club Excursionista, Regimiento 12 and El Quilla were some of them, so the club was nicknamed \"El Gitano (The Gypsy)\", because of the character of nomad that those people have. \nIn 1973 a group of girls started to practise field hockey at the club. Two years later the CRAI opened a section for this sport and the different categories are incorporated to the club."

Her body is twisted slightly, and her right arm is raised behind her. She is wearing a helmet with a raised visor and she looks skywards. In her left hand she holds the reins to her horse. The sword she originally held in her right hand was stolen in 1978, and not replaced until December 2011. The pedestal was designed by American artist H.L. Davis.\nThe front of the base has the inscription:\nLocation.\nIn 1921 the United States Commission of Fine Arts suggested that the sculpture be placed at the terrace of Meridian Hill Park.\nAcquisition.\nThe piece was first proposed in May 1916 by Mme Polifème to the Commission of Fine Arts in order to celebrate the friendship between France and the United States. During its creation, DuBois worked closely with the French Minister of Education and Fine Arts in producing a credible representation of the peasant girl.\nThe statue was completed in 1922 in Paris; the original () was cast in three copies, currently located respectively in Reims (1890), Paris (1895) and Strasbourg (1897). The replica in Washington was donated by Le Lyceum Société des Femmes de France to the women of the United States of America.\nDedication.\nOn 6 January 1923 when the piece was dedicated, President Warren G. Harding and the French Ambassador were the guests of honor. Mrs. Harding and Mme Jusserand, who represented France, also attended.\nReception.\nAccording to the National Commission of Fine Art it was described, at the time, as being \"regarded by artists as the finest equestrian statue of modern times.\" Henry Bacon wrote that \"Dubois's statue of Jeanne D'Arc is one of the fine things of the world and no setting is too good for it.\"\nInformation.\nIt is the only equestrian statue of a woman in Washington, D.C.\nOn the 500th anniversary of Joan's martyrdom, Paul Claudel, Ambassador of France, held a tribute to the Saint.\nCondition.\nThe sculpture was surveyed for condition in 1994 and was described as needing treatment."

        "text": "Frank Villenueve Nicholson (15 October 1878 – c. 1970) was an Australian Boer War veteran and rugby union player, a state and national representative who made two test appearances in 1903–1904, captaining the side on one occasion.\nEarly life.\nNicholson was born in Villeneuve, Queensland, a place renamed from \"Humberstone\" by his father (also named Frank) who started the first sawmill in the area in 1877, founding the small town.\nCareer.\nNicholson, a prop, played thirteen times for Queensland between 1900 and 1904 with twelve of these matches played against New South Wales. The Howell reference claims that Nicholson's rugby career was interrupted by enlistment in the Boer War. He claimed two international rugby caps for Australia. He appeared for Queensland against the touring New Zealanders in Brisbane in August 1903 and two weeks later made his international debut against the same tourists in Sydney, on 15 August 1903.\nIn 1904, he captained Queensland in the inter-state series and played alongside his brother Fred who scored a try in that match. Later that season he had the honour of captaining Australia in a Test match against a touring British Lions side. Australia lost the match 17–0. Nicholson was selected in a 1905 squad that toured New Zealand but he did not play in any matches of the tour.\nHe left Australia in 1905 going to Philadelphia to study dentistry. In 1906, he reintroduced Rugby per Rugby Union code to University of Pennsylvania while attending University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine (Class of 1910).\nUpon his return in 1911 he became a selector and coach of the Queensland state side."

        "title": "PDC World Cup of Darts",
        "text": "The PDC World Cup of Darts is a team darts tournament organised by the Professional Darts Corporation, and was one of the three new tournaments introduced into the PDC calendar in 2010. It is broadcast live by Sky Sports. Due to the rescheduling of the Players Championship Finals in the PDC calendar, the second edition was played in Hamburg, Germany, in February 2012. In 2015, the event took place the Eissporthalle Frankfurt, where it stayed until returning to Hamburg in 2019 when it moved to the Barclaycard Arena. In 2020, the event was held at the Salzburgarena in Salzburg, Austria, and in 2021, it returned to Germany, this time in the Sparkassen-Arena, Jena, and in 2022 and 2023, it returned to Frankfurt once more.\nThe competition succeeded the Jocky Wilson Cup; a one-off international match between England and Scotland held in Glasgow on 5 December 2009. England defeated Scotland by 6 points to 0.\nBackground.\nIn October 2009, PDC chairman Barry Hearn announced his intention to buy the British Darts Organisation and inject £2 million into amateur darts, but the BDO decided not to accept the offer. In a statement, Hearn stated \"The aim of our offer to the BDO was to unify the sport of darts and this remains our long-term objective despite the decision by the BDO County Associations\" The Jocky Wilson Cup was held in December. \nBut following the BDO's rejection, the PDC went on to arrange three brand new tournaments for 2010 to help the development of youth and women's darts: the PDC Under-21 World Championship, the PDC Women's World Championship, and the PDC World Cup of Darts.\nFormat.\nIn the first 3 competitions (held in 2010, 2012 and 2013), the participating teams were the top 24 countries in the PDC Order of Merit at the end of October after the 2010 World Grand Prix. Each nation's top ranked player was then joined by the second highest player of that country. For seeding, the average rank of both was used.\nThe top 8 nations automatically started in the second round (last 16). The other 16 nations played in the first round. Matches were best of 11 legs in doubles, and the losing team threw first in the next leg. The winners of the first round played the top eight ranked teams in the second round, also in best of 11 doubles.\nIn 2010, the winners of the second round were drawn into two groups of four (A &amp; B). Each team played each other once (three matches per team). Each match consisted of two singles and one doubles – all over best of five legs. 1 point was awarded for a singles win, and 2 points for a doubles win, with all points counting towards the overall league table. The top two teams in each group advanced to the semi-finals.\nThe semi-finals consisted of four singles games and one doubles game (if required) per match – all over best of 11 legs. Again, 1 point was awarded for a singles win, and 2 points for a doubles win. If the match score is 3–3 at the end of the games, then a sudden-death doubles leg would decide who goes through to the final.\nThe final was the same format as the semi-final, but each game was best of 15 legs.\nIn 2012, the first round format remained the same, with the exception being that the matches were best of 9 doubles. The second round had games where each match consisted of two singles and one doubles – over best of seven legs in singles, and best of 9 legs in doubles. As before, 1 point was awarded for a singles win, and 2 points for a doubles win. If the score was tied 2–2, then a sudden death doubles leg took place to determine the winner. The format was the same for the quarter-finals, with the exception that the doubles matches were best of 7 legs, like the singles.\nIn the semi-finals, games had each match consisting of four singles and one doubles match – over best of seven legs. As before, 1 point was awarded for a singles win, and 2 points for a doubles win. If the score was tied 3–3, then a sudden death doubles leg took place to determine the winner. In the final, the match consisted of four singles and one doubles match – over best of 13 legs. As before, 1 point was awarded for a singles win, and 2 points for a doubles win. If the score was tied 3–3, then a sudden death doubles leg took place to determine the winner.\nIn 2013, a new format was created. The 24 teams were put into groups of 3, which each contained one of the top 8 seeds, plus two other teams. The teams played each other in best of 9 doubles matches, with the top 2 in each group progressing to the last 16. The last 16 also used the same best of 9 doubles format.\nIn the quarter-finals onwards, the matches began with two best of 7 leg singles matches. If one team won both singles matches, they were declared the winner, if each team won one match each, a best of 7 doubles match would decide the winner. In the final, there would be four best of 7 leg singles matches (if needed), with a point for each win, with a 7 leg doubles decider, if the singles matches ended making the score 2–2.\nIn 2014 and 2015, the field extended to 32 teams, with the top 16 teams being seeded, and each playing a best of 9 doubles match to begin. After that, the format was the same as the later stages of the previous tournament with two best of 7 leg singles matches. If one team won both singles matches, they were declared the winner, if each team won one match each, a best of 7 doubles match would decide the winner. In the final, there would be four best of 7 leg singles matches (if needed), with a point for each win, with a 7 leg doubles decider, if the singles matches ended making the score 2–2. In 2015, the final was tweaked, so that the doubles match would be the third match.\nThe format remained the same until 2023, with the only major change being in 2016, when only the top 8 teams were seeded, rather than the top 16.\nIn March 2023, the PDC announced a completely revamped format for the following tournament set to happen between 15–18 June 2023. This new format consisted of 40 different nations for the first time in the events history and a group stage for the first time since 2013. 12 groups of 3 countries were drawn, with the winner of each group advancing into the second round, while the top four ranked countries automatically advance into the second round. This format also consisted of doubles throughout the competition for the first time.\nRecords and statistics.\nIndividual appearances.\nAs of the 2023 tournament, only 4 players have played in all 13 editions of the World Cup of Darts.\nThey are:"

        "text": "In the Battle of the Bowling Alley (August 21, 1950), United Nations Command (UN) forces defeated North Korean forces early in the Korean War near the city of Taegu, South Korea. The battle took place in a narrow valley, dubbed the \"Bowling Alley\", which was north of Taegu. It followed a week of fighting between the Korean People's Army (KPA) 13th Division and the Republic of Korea Army's (ROK) 1st Division along the latter's last defensible line in the hills north of the city. Reinforcements, including the US Army's 27th and 23rd Infantry Regiments were committed to bolster the ROK defenses. This battle and several others were smaller engagements of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter.\nFor another week, KPA divisions launched all the troops they had in massed attacks against the ROK and US lines. Their attacks, which usually occurred at night and were supported by armor and artillery, advanced with infantry and tanks in close support of one another. Each KPA attack ran into well-established UN lines, where US tanks, mines and entrenched infantry were positioned to counter them. Strikes by US aircraft ravaged the attacking KPA. The fighting was fierce with many casualties on both sides, particularly where the KPA and ROK fought one another. The repeated attacks eventually broke and pushed back the ROK forces. The KPA continued their push against the Pusan Perimeter until they were outflanked in the Battle of Inchon.\nBackground.\nOutbreak of war.\nFollowing the invasion of South Korea by North Korea on June 25, 1950, the United Nations voted to use force to defend South Korea. The United States simultaneously committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of pushing back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. But US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest force was the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Nevertheless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea.\nThe 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial \"shock\" of KPA advances, delaying much larger KPA units to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive. The division fought for several weeks while the 1st Cavalry, 7th Infantry and 25th Infantry Divisions and Eighth United States Army supporting units were arriving. Advance elements of the 24th Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, the first encounter between US and KPA forces. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, the 24th Infantry Division was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior KPA numbers and equipment. The regiments of the division were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th Division was finally annihilated in the Battle of Taejon, but was able to delay the KPA forces until July 20. By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to KPA forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.\nNorth Korean advance.\nAfter the fight at Taejon, UN forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the KPA advance in a series of engagements in the southern section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening a pass to the Pusan area from the west. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju, east of Hadong, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to Pusan open to direct KPA attacks. The UN formations were subsequently able to defeat the KPA in the Battle of the Notch on August 2, halting their advance from the west. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.\nTaegu.\nMeanwhile, the Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker had established Taegu as his headquarters. At the center of the Pusan Perimeter line, Taegu stood at the entrance to the Naktong River valley, an area where KPA forces could advance in large numbers in close support. The natural barriers provided by the Naktong River to the south and the mountainous terrain to the north converged around Taegu, a transportation hub and the last major South Korean city aside from Pusan itself to remain in UN hands. From south to north, the city was defended by the US 1st Cavalry Division, the ROK 1st Division and the 6th Division, which were under the command of ROK II Corps. The 1st Cavalry Division was spread out along a long line on the Naktong River to the south, with its 5th and 8th Cavalry Regiments holding a line along the river south of Waegwan, facing west. The 7th Cavalry Regiment held position to the east in reserve, along with artillery forces, ready to reinforce anywhere a KPA crossing could be attempted. The ROK 1st Division held a northwest-facing line in the mountains immediately north of the city while the ROK 6th Division held position to the east, guarding the narrow valley holding the Kunwi road into the Pusan Perimeter area.\nFive KPA divisions amassed around Taegu to oppose the UN forces in the city. From south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st North Korean Divisions occupied a wide line encircling Taegu from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The KPA planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong River valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south, so the KPA divisions all eventually moved through this valley, crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground. Elements of the KPA 105th Armored Division also supported the attack.\nPrelude.\nUS and ROK forces assemble.\nDuring mid-August, the US 27th Infantry Regiment was mopping up KPA resistance from the southern part of the Naktong Bulge area to counter a KPA attack there. The regiment, temporarily attached to the US 24th Infantry Division, was recalled by the Eighth Army when a new KPA threat formed to the north of Taegu, alarming Walker. Acting on the threat, Walker relieved the regiment from the 24th Infantry Division on August 14 and the next day ordered it northward to Kyongsan as a reserve force. Arriving at Kyongsan on August 16, Colonel John H. Michaelis, 27th Infantry's commander, was ordered to reconnoiter routes east, north, northwest, and west of Kyongsan and counter any KPA attacks from these directions. During the day, two KPA T-34 tanks came through the ROK 1st Division lines north of Taegu at Tabu-dong, but ROK 3.5-inch bazooka teams knocked out both of them. The ROK 1st Division, also in the area, was ordered to assemble in the hills around the road and wait for reinforcements or make a last stand if needed to prevent the KPA from coming any closer to Taegu. To its east was the ROK 6th Division and to its west was the Naktong River.\nAt 12:00 the next day, August 17, Eighth Army ordered the 27th Infantry to move its headquarters and a reinforced battalion \"without delay\" to a point across the Kumho River north of Taegu on the road from Tabu-dong to Sangju \"to secure Taegu from enemy penetration\" from that direction. South Korean sources reported a KPA regiment, led by six T-34 tanks, had entered the village of Kumhwa, north of Tabu-dong. The 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, a platoon of the Heavy Mortar Company, and most of the 8th Field Artillery Battalion moved north to Ch'ilgok where the ROK 1st Division command post was located. By nightfall, the entire 27th Regiment was north of Taegu on the Tabu-dong road, reinforced by C Company, 73rd Tank Battalion. US Army commanders also ordered the 37th Field Artillery Battalion to move from the area around Kyongju and P'ohang-dong, where a heavy battle had been in progress for days, for attachment to the US 27th Infantry Regiment in order to reinforce the 8th Field Artillery Battalion above Taegu. It arrived there the next day. At the front, ROK 1st Division commander Brigadier General Paik Sun-yup assumed senior command of the 27th Infantry and the other US units, to the chagrin of Michaelis.\nNorth Korean forces assemble.\nIn its engagements during the Perimeter battle, the KPA 13th Division, with 9,500 men, had forced ROK troops into the Tabu-dong corridor and started advancing on Taegu. This division had battled the ROK 11th and 12th Regiments in the Yuhak-san area for a week before it broke through to the corridor on August 17. A regimental commander of the division said later it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process. On August 18, the 13th Division was concentrated mostly west of the road just north of Tabu-dong.\nTo the west of the KPA 13th Division, the KPA 15th Division with 5,000 men was also deployed on Yuhak-san. It, too, had begun battling the ROK 1st Division, but thus far only in minor engagements. The KPA High Command then ordered the KPA 15th Division to move from its position northwest of Tabu-dong eastward, to the Yongch'on front, where the KPA 8th Division had tried and failed to advance to the Taegu lateral corridor. The KPA 15th Division left the Yuhak-san area on August 20. Meanwhile, the KPA 1st Division, to the east of the 13th, advanced to the Kunwi area, north of Taegu. The KPA command ordered it to proceed to the Tabu-dong area and maneuver astride the 13th Division for the attack on Taegu down the Tabu-dong corridor. At the same time, the KPA received their only substantial tank reinforcements during the Pusan Perimeter fighting. On August 15, the KPA 105th Armored Division received 21 new T-34 tanks and 200 troop replacements, which it distributed to the divisions attacking Taegu. The tank regiment with the KPA 13th Division reportedly had 14 T-34 tanks.\nOn August 18, the KPA 13th Division was astride the Sangju–Taegu road just above Tabu-dong and only from Taegu. The Eighth Army ordered the 27th Infantry Regiment to attack north along the road to counter the threat. At the same time, two regiments of the ROK 1st Division were to attack along high ground on either side of the road. The plan called for a limited-objective attack to restore the ROK 1st Division lines in the vicinity of Sokchok, a village north of Tabu-dong. M26 Pershing tanks of C Company, 73rd Tank Battalion, and two batteries of the 37th Field Artillery Battalion were to support the 27th Infantry in the attack.\nTerrain.\nIn front of the 27th Infantry position, the poplar-lined Taegu–Sangju road ran northward in the narrow mountain valley. A stream on the west closely paralleled the road, which was nearly straight on a north-south axis through the 27th Infantry position and for some distance northward. This stretch of the road later became known as the \"Bowling Alley.\" About in front of the 27th Infantry position the road forked at a small village called Ch'onp'yong-dong; the western prong was the main Sangju road, the eastern one was the road to Kunwi. At the road fork, the Sangju road bends to the northwest in a long curve. The village of Sinjumak lay on this curve a short distance north of the fork. Hills protected it against direct fire from the 27th Infantry position. It was there that the KPA tanks remained hidden during the daytime.\nRising from the valley on the west side was the Yuhak-san mountain range which swept up to a height of . On the east, a similar mountain range rose to a height of , culminating southward in a mountain called Ka-san, more than high at its walled summit. The Kunwi and Sangju roads from the northeast and northwest entered the natural and easy corridor between Yuhak-san and Ka-san at Ch'onp'yong-dong, leading into the Taegu basin. The battles in the Bowling Alley occurred south of this road junction.\nBattle.\nAugust 21 attack.\nThat evening, the 27th Infantry placed two belts of antipersonnel mines and trip flares across the road and stream bed and in front of its positions in the valley. After dusk, the KPA began shelling the general area of the 27th Infantry positions until just before midnight. ROK troops had planned to mount an attack, but it became apparent that the KPA would hit first. Then the KPA 13th Division launched a major attack against the entire UN front in and around the valley. Nine US tanks supported the infantry troops in the valley. Because it was on higher ground and positioned in front of all the other American units, C Company on the left of the road usually was the first to detect an approaching attack. That evening the C Company commander telephoned the regimental headquarters that he could hear tanks. When the artillery fired an illuminating shell he was able to count 19 KPA vehicles in the attacking column on the road. The tanks and self-propelled guns approached the American positions, firing rapidly. Most of their shells landed in the rear areas. KPA infantry moved forward on both sides of the road. Simultaneously, other KPA units attacked the ROK troops on the high ridges flanking the valley.\nAmerican artillery and mortar fire bombarded the KPA, trying to separate the tanks from the infantry. US machine gun fire opened on the KPA infantry only after they had entered the mine field and were at close range. The US M26 tanks in the front line held their fire until the KPA tanks came very close. One of the American tanks knocked out the lead KPA tank and a bazooka team from F Company knocked out a towed gun, the third vehicle in column. The trapped second tank was disabled by bazooka fire and abandoned by its crew. It was during this fight that the battle received its name. The US troops at the battle noted the tank shells being fired up and down the valley in the dark looked \"like bowling balls.\"\nArtillery and 90 mm tank fire destroyed seven more KPA T-34s, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and personnel carriers. This night battle, which was at times very intense, lasted about five hours. The US B Battery, 8th Field Artillery Battalion alone fired 1,661 105 mm rounds, the 4.2-inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds, the 81 mm mortar platoon fired 1,200 rounds, and F Company, 27th Infantry fired 385 60 mm mortar rounds. The KPA column was completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the KPA had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight. Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated their units and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.\nAftermath.\nThe confirmed KPA losses from August 18 to 25 included 13 T-34 tanks, six SU-76 self-propelled guns, and 23 trucks. The KPA 13th Division's troops suffered heavy casualties during the fight, with an estimated 3,000 killed, wounded and captured. The division withdrew to rebuild. The North Koreans' total casualties from August 12 to 25 were 5,690 killed.\nUS losses during the battle were extremely light; unusual for fighting at a time in which other UN offensive forces were paying a heavy price when making similar pushes against the KPA. The US infantry forces suffered only five killed and 54 wounded in the 27th Infantry, plus three killed and 16 wounded in the 23rd Infantry. This brought the total US casualty count to 8 dead, 70 wounded. ROK troops suffered much more heavily during the fight. An estimated 2,300 soldiers were killed in the fighting; 2,244 enlisted men and 56 officers. However, these losses were not crippling, as volunteers poured in from the surrounding countryside to fight for the ROK."

        "text": "The 2006 IIHF World Championship final was an ice hockey match that took place on 21 May 2006 at the Arena Riga in Riga, Latvia, to determine the winner of the 2006 IIHF World Championship. Sweden defeated the Czech Republic 4–0 to win its 8th championship. It's the only time the Czechs have lost the gold medal game in tournament history.\nBackground.\nThe game marked the first time that Sweden and the Czech Republic would meet in the World Championship finals. The Czech Republic were finalists for the second time in as many years, and they were defending champions having beaten Canada to win the 2004 edition. However, Sweden were just coming off a gold medal winning performance at the 2006 Olympics. This was seen as either a curse or good-luck, on the one hand, no team had ever won Olympic and World Championship gold in the same year, on the other it showed the strength of the Swedish team.\nVenue.\nThe Arena Riga in Riga was determined to host the final of the championship. Previously at the tournament, the venue hosted both the semi-finals, and also the Bronze medal match. In the final, the attendance was 9,800.\nThe Match.\nSummary.\nJesper Mattsson opened the scoring for Sweden at 14:36 minutes into the first period, assisted by Niklas Kronwall, and Andreas Karlsson. This ended up to be the game-winning goal. Just 37 seconds later Fredrik Emvall put one in five-hole on Milan Hnilička, assisted by Karlsson, and Mattson.\nAt 4:07 into the second period, Kronwall received a pass from Ronnie Sundin, off of Michael Nylander and rushed down the right wing, cut into the slot and put it backhand on Hnilička. With only minutes remaining in the second period Jörgen Jönsson fired a successful one-timer shot from a pass by Mikael Samuelsson.\nThe Czechs were lacking offense and only managed 15 shots the entire game including only 4 in the second period. The Swedes dominated all three zones, and Johan Holmqvist, the Swedish goaltender came away with only the second ever shutout in a single game World Championship final.\nThe Swedish coach, Bengt-Åke Gustafsson, said of his team's historic win: \"Most people believed it was impossible. To win an Olympics by itself is an achievement that was something special. But coming here with a new team, new guys, is special as well.\""

        "text": "The 2010 South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team represented the University of South Carolina in the 2010 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Gamecocks played their home games in Carolina Stadium. The team was coached by Ray Tanner, who was in his fourteenth season at Carolina.\nUSC finished second in the Southeastern Conference regular season standings, and received an at-large bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The Gamecocks were designated the #1 seed and host of the Columbia Regional. Carolina went 3–0 in their Regional to advance to the Super Regionals. The Gamecocks beat Coastal Carolina in two games to win the Myrtle Beach Super Regional and advance to the 2010 College World Series. After losing the opener, the Gamecocks won their next six games to win the national championship, defeating UCLA in the CWS Championship Series in consecutive games, 7–1 and 2–1.\nRegular season.\nThe Gamecocks won their first seven SEC series of the 2010 season, which continued a streak of ten straight dating back to the end of the 2009 season. Another carryover streak was that of Whit Merrifield, who set a USC record when he hit safely in his 26th game in a row during the March 10 contest against Valparaiso. Another school record was tied in that game, as Gamecock pitchers combined to strike out 18 batters. Scott Wingo set a USC record on March 13 when he was hit by a pitch for the 35th time in his college career.\nCarolina lost the annual series against archrival Clemson for the first time since 2006 by losing two of three games against the Tigers. The March 6 game at Fluor Field was the first game between both schools at that stadium and the first game played in Greenville since the 1990 season.\nHead Coach Ray Tanner recorded his 600th victory at USC with a 10–1 win over The Citadel on March 30, and his 1,000th career victory with a 2–0 win over Vanderbilt on April 11.\nOverall, Carolina played nine schools that would eventually make the 2010 NCAA tournament (Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, The Citadel, Clemson, College of Charleston, Florida, Mississippi, Vanderbilt). The Gamecocks compiled a 16–8 record against these schools. USC finished the regular season a perfect 15–0 in their midweek games.\nPostseason.\nSEC tournament.\nCarolina entered the SEC tournament as the #3 seed by virtue of finishing second in the Eastern Division (Florida claimed the #1 seed by winning the SEC regular season championship and Auburn claimed the #2 seed by finishing first in the Western Division). The Gamecocks would lose their first two games against Ole Miss and Auburn (both were teams that the Gamecocks won series against in the regular season) being eliminated from the tournament without posting a victory.\nNCAA tournament.\nCarolina was awarded the #1 seed in the Columbia Regional of the 2010 NCAA tournament. On June 4, the Gamecocks opened regional play with #4 seed Bucknell. USC trailed 5–1 before rallying for five runs in the eighth inning, going on to defeat the Bison, 9–5. On June 5, Carolina would face #3 seed in-state foe, The Citadel, whom the Gamecocks had defeated twice during the regular season. Facing Bulldog ace and MLB first-round draft pick Asher Wojciechowski, USC would again come from behind, scoring five in the seventh and another two in the ninth to overcome a 4–2 deficit for the 9–4 victory, riding Blake Cooper's career-high 12 strikeouts. On June 6, Carolina squared off against #2 seed Virginia Tech, and scored six in the sixth to defeat the Hokies, 10–2, to sweep the Columbia Regional Championship and advance to the Super Regionals.\nThe Gamecocks were sent on the road to the Myrtle Beach Super Regional to face #4 national seed Coastal Carolina. On June 12, Carolina defeated Coastal, 4–3, behind four early runs and another quality start by staff ace Blake Cooper. On June 13, the Gamecocks again found themselves needing to come from behind in the late-innings. Trailing the Chanticleers 9–7 in the eighth, freshman first-baseman Christian Walker became an instant hero with a 3-run blast that led to a 10–9 victory and a ninth trip to Omaha for South Carolina.\nCollege World Series.\nBy virtue of their Super Regional sweep of Coastal Carolina, South Carolina joined Arizona State, Clemson, Florida, Florida State, Oklahoma, TCU, and UCLA in the 2010 College World Series. Before this year's appearance, South Carolina had a 17–16 record in the CWS, with runner-up finishes in 1975, 1977 and 2002. On June 20, the Gamecocks lost their opener to Oklahoma, 4–3, in a game that was played over nine hours due to two lengthy delays for rain and lightning. Playing out of the losers' bracket with no margin for error, Carolina drubbed #1 national seed Arizona State 11–4 on June 22, scoring eight runs in the second inning to send the Sun Devils home. On June 24, the Gamecocks eliminated Oklahoma behind more late-inning heroics. Trailing 2–1 and down to their last strike in the 12th inning, Jackie Bradley Jr. singled home the tying run and following a walk to pinch-hitter Jeffery Jones, Brady Thomas lined the first pitch he saw up the middle for a walk-off RBI single. In a repeat of the 2002 CWS, Carolina found themselves in the position of having to beat Clemson twice in order to advance to the Championship Series. On June 25, Michael Roth made his first pitching start in over a year for the Gamecocks, and shut down the red-hot bats of the Tigers with a three-hit, complete-game performance in a dominating 5–1 victory. The following evening saw a rematch of the archrivals, with Carolina defeating Clemson, 4–3, and moving on to face UCLA in the CWS Finals. The Gamecocks and the Bruins were both playing for the first baseball national championship for either school, and Carolina put themselves in the driver's seat as they cruised to a 7–1 victory in the first game of the series. Game 2 would turn out to be the last CWS game ever played in historic Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium, and it was one for the ages. The Gamecocks and Bruins were locked in a pitchers' duel, and UCLA held a 1–0 lead until the bottom of the eighth when Carolina tied things up. The respective closers for the two teams would continue the pitching battle for another three innings, until the bottom of the 11th when Scott Wingo drew a leadoff walk, advanced to second on a passed ball and was moved to third on a sacrifice bunt. With one out, UCLA decided to pitch to Whit Merrifield, who lined a 2–0 pitch into right field to bring home the winning run.\nSchedule.\n! style=\"background:#73000A;color:white;\"| Regular season (43–13)\n! style=\"background:#73000A;color:white;\"| Post-season\nGamecocks in the 2010 MLB Draft.\nThe following members of the South Carolina Gamecocks baseball program were drafted in the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft."

        "title": "John Howard (lacrosse)",
        "text": "John Douglas \"Hezzy\" Howard (December 12, 1934 – July 19, 2007) was an American educator and college lacrosse player and coach. He coached the University of Maryland lacrosse team from 1966 to 1969 and amassed a 32–7–1 record. He attended Washington College, where in 1956 he received the Jack Turnbull Award as the nation's best attackman. Howard was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1978. At the University of Maryland, Howard also taught as an English professor and held various posts in the school's English department including acting chairman from 1979 to 1980.\nEarly life and college career.\nA native of Annapolis, Maryland, born on December 12, 1934, Howard attended St. Mary's High School starting in 1948, where he played lacrosse on the school's first team. He graduated in 1952.\nHoward then went on to Washington College in 1953, where he played soccer, and lacrosse as an attackman and face-off man. He was a member of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society. In 1954, Howard led the nation in assists and helped the Shoremen capture the Laurie Cox Division championship. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association named Howard an honorable mention All-American. The following the season, he repeated as the nation's assist leader and the USILA named him to its third team. In 1956, the USILA awarded him All-America first team honors and the Jack Turnbull Award as the nation's best attackman. Howard was invited to participate in the 1956 North/South Senior All-Star Game, and scored five goals and earned six assists on the way to a South squad win. Howard set the record for career assists with 173, which stood until broken by Tim Nelson of Syracuse in 1985.\nAfter college, Howard served as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy. He attained the rank of lieutenant.\nCoaching career.\nHoward began his coaching career at the University of Maryland as the freshman team coach in 1960. In 1962, he was promoted to assistant coach under co-head coaches Jack Faber and Al Heagy. In 1966, Howard took over as the head coach himself. In 1967, Howard guided Maryland to an 8–1 record, which was enough to secure a share of the USILA national championship alongside Navy and Johns Hopkins. An upset of heavy favorites Johns Hopkins, 9–4, was the deciding factor in Maryland's title stake. The following season in 1968, Maryland defeated the dominant team of the period, Navy, 5–3, which was the Terrapins' first victory against the Midshipmen in eight years. That year also saw one of only four ties in Maryland lacrosse history, a 6–6 stalemate with Princeton.\nRennie Smith, a Maryland assistant coach and Lacrosse Hall of Fame inductee, said, \"Hezzy was a bit of a free spirit, but he was very likeable. He was a handsome guy. We used to like to go to his office because the girls were always coming in and cooing, 'Hi, Hezzy.'\" Bill Sbarra, who played as a defenseman under Howard, said, \"He was the first coach I ever saw who inverted his attackmen and midfielders ... The day we upset Hopkins, we knew everything Hopkins was going to do. Hezzy's scouting report was brilliant.\"\nWhile coaching at Maryland, Howard also played lacrosse at the club level. He played for the Washington Lacrosse Club from 1963 to 1967, including in the Maryland Box Lacrosse League in 1965 and 1966. He led the league in scoring in 1965.\nAcademic career.\nWhile at Maryland, Howard also taught in the English department. He earned his master's degree in 1962 and Ph.D in 1967 from the University of Maryland. Howard began teaching as an English instructor from 1964 to 1967, while working towards his doctorate. He became an assistant professor in 1967, an associate professor in 1971, and a full professor in 1987. He served as associate chairman of the English department from 1969 to 1972 and 1977 to 1979, and then acting chairman from 1979 to 1980. From 1987 to 1990, he was the director of graduate studies. Howard authored numerous books, essays, and literature reviews, including several on English poet William Blake. Howard wrote \"Infernal Poetics: Poetic Structures in Blake's Lambeth Prophecies\" and \"Blake's Milton: A Study in the Selfhood\".\nLater life.\nIn 2000, Howard retired to Greencastle, Indiana, where his wife taught at DePauw University. He attempted to foster the sport at the college, but failed. Howard explained:\"I tried to start lacrosse at DePauw. We held a few practices in the fall. The kids had a problem—they would not believe you could catch and throw a lacrosse ball while you were running. They thought you had to be standing still ... After Christmas, nobody came back. Either I'm a lousy teacher or kids in Indiana just didn't like lacrosse.\"\nHoward died of pneumonia on July 19, 2007, at the age of 72 at Saint Vincent Hospice in Indianapolis. He was inducted into National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1978, the Washington College Hall of Fame in 1983, and the St. Mary's High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1996."

Martin had the most international experience on the team and was also the oldest player at 31. Bauer's team was considered strong on defence, but short on goal scoring.\nThis national team participated in the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. Team Canada performed well and finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, but lost 3–2 to the Soviet Union for the opportunity to play in the gold medal game. This placed Canada in a three-way tie with Czechoslovakia and Sweden for second place in the tournament. Based on goal differential, Canada was placed third in the World Championships behind the Sweden, with Czechoslovakia in fourth. Olympic officials calculated the standing on different tie-breaking rules that based the goal differential over the entire tournament – not just among teams involved in the medal round. The Olympic decision dropped Canada to fourth place and out of the medals for the first time in Olympic hockey history."

        "title": "South Korea at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The South Korea national football team have appeared eleven times at the FIFA World Cup, including ten consecutive tournaments from 1986 to 2022. The team made its World Cup debut in 1954, losing both matches and finishing fourth in the group stage. South Korea's best ever result is fourth place at the 2002 tournament, co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. At the tournament, South Korea eliminated Italy and Spain in the round of 16 and quarter-finals, respectively, and thus became the first team outside Europe and the Americas to reach the semi-finals.\nAwards.\nSouth Korea is the only Asian team to ever win a team award at a FIFA World Cup when they were voted the Most Entertaining Team in 2002 after finishing in fourth place. In the same year, Hong Myung-bo and Yoo Sang-chul were voted members of the All-star team. They are the only two Asians ever to be named in an All-star team. Hong also received the Bronze Ball award, becoming the first Asian player ever to receive the award.\nDetails.\n1954 (Switzerland).\nSouth Korea made their World Cup debut in 1954, becoming the second Asian team after Indonesia to ever enter the World Cup. Qualifying occurred in March 1954, barely one year after the end of the Korean War. Only South Korea and Japan competed for the Asian spot at the World Cup, and as the Koreans refused to give visas to their rivals and former colonizers, both qualifier games were held in Tokyo. With a squad that consisted entirely of army personnel, South Korea eliminated Japan with a 5–1 victory followed by a 2–2 draw.\nSouth Korea played games against Hungary and Turkey, losing 9–0 and 7–0 respectively. Hong Deok-young became the goalkeeper to concede the most goals in a single World Cup.\n1986 (Mexico).\nSouth Korea started the first round of the Asian qualification against Malaysia and Nepal. After qualifying for the knockout stage as group winners of the first round, South Korea beat Indonesia and Japan in the second round and the final round, respectively. They received one of the two available World Cup spots for Asian teams.\nIn the World Cup finals, South Korea were allocated in group A with Argentina, Bulgaria and Italy. Their first match was against Argentina, who defeated them 3–1 with Diego Maradona playing a major role. In the match, Park Chang-sun scored the first South Korean goal in the World Cup history. South Korea drew the second match 1–1 with Bulgaria in a downpour, and lost the last group match 3–2 to defending champions Italy.\n1990 (Italy).\nSouth Korea won the Asian qualifying competition with nine victories and two draws without a defeat. However, they lost all three group matches against Belgium, Spain and Uruguay. Hwangbo Kwan scored the only tournament goal for South Korea with a long-range shot against Spain.\n1994 (United States).\nIn the final round of the Asian qualification, the top two countries could advance to the 1994 FIFA World Cup, but South Korea was one point behind Japan and Saudi Arabia prior to playing the last qualifier against North Korea. South Korea couldn't qualify for the World Cup without a help of other countries. An Iraqi forward Jaffar Omran scored the equaliser in the last seconds of the match against Japan, and their match ended in a 2–2 draw. In their match, South Korea defeated North Korea 3–0, finishing with the same number of points as Japan. Conclusionally, South Korea succeeded in getting a World Cup ticket with a better goal difference than Japan, and this result was called the \"Miracle of Doha\" in South Korea.\nAt the 1994 World Cup, South Korea made tight games with Spain and Bolivia, but they were eliminated in the group stage after losing 3–2 to Germany.\n1998 (France).\nSouth Korea's former star player Cha Bum-kun managed the national team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In the first half of the first match against Mexico, Ha Seok-ju scored the opening goal with a free kick, but he was sent off for an ill-advised tackle three minutes later. In the second half, South Korea failed to defend their 1–0 lead as Mexico scored three goals. They lost 5–0 to the Netherlands in the following match, and Cha was fired after the match. The assistant manager Kim Pyung-seok replaced Cha, leading a 1–1 draw with Belgium.\n2002 (South Korea and Japan).\nSouth Korea was one of the host nations of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, along with Japan. Led by Dutch manager Guus Hiddink and his countryman Pim Verbeek, South Korean team won their first group match against Poland, achieving their first-ever World Cup victory. Afterwards, they drew 1–1 with the United States in the following match and furthermore, they defeated Portugal 1–0 in the last group match, qualifying for the knockout stage as the group winners.\nIn the round of 16, South Korea defeated Italy 2–1 after extra time, although there were controversial refereeing decisions including Francesco Totti's second yellow card and an offside decision against Damiano Tommasi. South Korea also defeated Spain on penalties in the quarter-finals, surpassing North Korea's result in 1966. However, their run was halted by losing 1–0 to Germany in the semi-finals. They finished fourth in the tournament after losing 3–2 to Turkey in the third place match. Team captain Hong Myung-bo won the Bronze Ball award.\n2006 (Germany).\n&lt;section begin=2006 /&gt;Former manager Jo Bonfrère qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but failed to satisfy the expectations of the Korea Football Association. Dick Advocaat replaced Bonfrère to participate in the World Cup, but Advocaat secretly contracted with a Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg just before the tournament, for which he was criticized.\nDespite controversies about managers, South Korea defeated Togo 2–1 and drew 1–1 with eventual finalists France. However, they were eliminated in the group stage after losing 2–0 to Switzerland in the last match.\n&lt;section end=2006 /&gt;\n2010 (South Africa).\n&lt;section begin=2010 /&gt;The Korean FA appointed Hiddink's predecessor Huh Jung-moo as the manager again after Pim Verbeek resigned due to mental stress at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Under Huh, South Korea won their group in the final round (fourth round) of the Asian qualifiers with four victories and four draws without a loss, easily qualifying for the 2010 tournament. Park Ji-sung, Park Chu-young, Lee Chung-yong, and Ki Sung-yueng were in charge of South Korea's attack in the qualifiers, and were evaluated as four key players among the squad of the time.\nSouth Korea finished second in the Group B with four points, qualifying for the knockout stage. They were then eliminated from the tournament after losing to Uruguay in the round of 16.\n&lt;section end=2010 /&gt;\n2014 (Brazil).\nHong Myung-bo became the national team manager one year before the 2014 World Cup, and had to prepare for the competition in a short period of time. He called the bronze medalists of the 2012 Summer Olympics who had been led by him, but performed below par in the World Cup. They were pelted with yeot (a traditional Korean confectionery, which can sometimes be used to express insults) when they returned to South Korea.\n2018 (Russia).\nFor the combined qualification matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, South Korea won all seven matches without conceding a goal in the second round but following a series of poor results in the third round of qualifiers, including losses to China and Qatar, the former manager Uli Stielike was sacked and was replaced by under-23 coach Shin Tae-yong for the remainder of the qualifying round. Under Shin Tae-yong, the team managed to qualify as the second-placed team in their group following two goalless draws against Iran and Uzbekistan, sending South Korea to the World Cup for the ninth consecutive time. Shin quickly tested various tactics after the qualifiers, but he had difficulty carrying out his plan due to injuries of many players. Some of them were eventually excluded from the team.\nAt the 2018 World Cup, they lost their first game against Sweden 1–0 after conceding from a penalty. They then faced Mexico and lost 2–1 after conceding another penalty. However, despite their two consecutive losses, South Korea was not eliminated just yet. To have any chance of advancing, South Korea would have to win their final group stage match against the defending champions Germany by at least two goals and Mexico would have to defeat Sweden in its last group stage game. South Korea for its part did what it had to do to stay in contention and won 2–0 against Germany with goals from Kim Young-gwon and Son Heung-min, causing them to be eliminated in the first round for the first time in 80 years. Germany had 28 shots with 6 on target, but the South Korea's defense, led by keeper Jo Hyeon-woo, did not concede once. However, Mexico lost to Sweden that same day and thus South Korea ultimately finished third in the group. As a result, South Korea saved Mexico from being eliminated and Mexican fans heavily praised the Koreans and celebrated their victory in front of the South Korean embassy. The match is also called the \"Miracle of Kazan\" in South Korea although they dropped out of the tournament.\n2022 (Qatar).\nThe South Korean team, led by manager Paulo Bento and captained by the reigning Premier League Golden Boot winner Son Heung-min, qualified for the World Cup as the second-placed team of the AFC qualifying group A. After a goalless draw against Uruguay and a narrow defeat against Ghana, South Korea defeated Portugal 2–1 in the final match of the group stage with a stoppage-time goal by Hwang Hee-chan. Uruguay defeated Ghana 2–0, which meant that South Korea advanced to the knockout stage for the first time since 2010 on virtue of scoring more goals than Uruguay, with the same number of points. In the round of 16, the team was eliminated after losing 4–1 to Brazil."

        "title": "2015 Copa América",
        "text": "The 2015 Copa América was the 44th edition of the Copa América, the main international football tournament for national teams in South America, and took place in Chile between 11 June and 4 July 2015. The competition was organized by CONMEBOL, South America's football governing body.\nTwelve teams competed: the ten members of CONMEBOL and two guests from CONCACAF – Mexico and Jamaica, the latter of which competed in the Copa América for the first time.\nUruguay were the defending champions, but were eliminated by the host nation Chile in the quarter-finals. Chile won their first title, defeating Argentina in the final on penalties after a goalless draw. As winners, they qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.\nHost country.\nOriginally, it was to be hosted by Brazil, as suggested by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) in February 2011 due to CONMEBOL's rotation policy of tournaments being held in alphabetical order. However, due to the organization of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics in that country, Brazil decided against also hosting the Copa América. CONMEBOL's president Nicolas Leoz had mentioned the possibility of the tournament being organized in Mexico (despite this country not being a member of CONMEBOL) as part of the federation's centenary celebrations. Brazil and Chile's Football Federations discussed the idea of swapping around the order of being hosts of the 2015 and 2019 tournaments. The swap was made official in May 2012.\nVenues.\nThere were nine different stadiums in eight cities used for the tournament. Most stadiums were renovated or rebuilt for the contest.\nTeams.\nMexico and Japan were initially invited to join the 10 CONMEBOL nations in the tournament. Japan declined the invitation, and China was invited instead, but later withdrew due to the Asian sector of qualification for the 2018 World Cup being held at the same time. In May 2014, it was announced that the Jamaica Football Federation had accepted an invitation to participate, thus making Jamaica the first Caribbean nation to compete in Copa America.\nDraw.\nThe draw of the tournament was originally to be held on 27 October 2014 in Viña del Mar, but was postponed to 24 November. The 12 teams were drawn into three groups of four.\nCONMEBOL announced the composition of the four pots on 10 November 2014. Pot 1 contained the hosts Chile (which has been automatically assigned to position A1), together with Argentina and Brazil. The remaining nine teams were allocated to the other three pots according to their FIFA World Rankings as of 23 October 2014 (shown in brackets), even though Colombia was rated higher than Brazil. On 23 November 2014, it was announced by CONMEBOL that Argentina and Brazil had been assigned to positions B1 and C1, respectively.\nSquads.\nEach country had a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) which had to be submitted before the deadline of 1 June 2015.\nThe 2015 UEFA Champions League Final date of 6 June caused problems for South American players for Barcelona and Juventus. FIFA international rules require clubs to release players 14 days prior to the start of an international tournament, but the players featured in the final, leaving them at most five days to acclimate. For example, Arturo Vidal arrived two days before Chile's first match against Ecuador, and played with little training with his national team.\nMexico manager Miguel Herrera decided to prioritize the upcoming 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup, saying, \"We have to win at all costs in order to face the United States in the playoffs that guarantee a spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup.\" The Mexican squad was a team composed mostly from the local league with little international experience.\nUruguayan forward Luis Suárez was suspended for the whole tournament, as he served a nine-match ban in international football for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's final group stage match against Italy in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nMatch officials.\n\"Source\":\nGroup stage.\nThe fixture schedule was announced on 11 November 2014.\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the twelve teams divided into three groups of four teams. Each group was a round-robin of six games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams finishing first, second and two best-placed third teams in each group qualified for the quarter-finals.\nTeams were ranked on the following criteria:\nAll times local, CLT ().\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, the eight teams played a single-elimination tournament, with the following rules:\nStatistics.\nGoalscorers.\nChile's Eduardo Vargas and Peru's Paolo Guerrero scored the most goals, with 4 each. In total, 59 goals were scored by 39 different players, with two of them credited as own goals.\nAssists.\n3 assists\n2 assists\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.\nMarketing.\nLogo and slogan.\nOn 2 April 2014, the official logo was unveiled, along with the slogan \"El Corazón del Fútbol\" (\"The Heart of Football\").\nMatch ball.\nOn 16 November 2014, the official match ball (OMB) was unveiled at the Estadio Nacional. The name of the ball is Nike Cachaña, which is a Chilean slang term for a successful feint or dribble. During its launch, the Chilean international Arturo Vidal was present. The ball is mainly designed with white as main appearance featured with blue and red applications, representing host nation Chile. The colors of Chilean flag make a statement in the design of this ball: the red representing the people, the blue symbolizing the Chilean sky, and the white for the Andes that so strongly define the geography of this country.\nMascot.\nThe official mascot of the tournament, a young culpeo fox, was unveiled on 17 November 2014. The name of the mascot, \"Zincha\" (from \"Zorro\" (fox) and \"hINCHA\" (fan)), was chosen by the public over two other options, \"Andi\" and \"Kul\".\nOfficial song.\n\"Al Sur del Mundo\" by Chilean group Noche de Brujas served as the official song of the tournament. It was performed during the opening ceremony of the competition on 11 June. It features the different cultures of the twelve competing nations.\nIncidents and controversies.\nThe day after Chile's 3–3 draw against Mexico in their second group match, Jorge Sampaoli gave the players a day off from training. They had to return to the training ground by 9pm, but Arturo Vidal did not arrive. He had been involved in a traffic accident on his way back to the ground, and arrested for driving under the influence. He spent the night in jail, and appeared in court the morning after. His driving license was revoked, and he was sentenced to pay for the damage done. Although there was speculation that he would be dropped, Sampaoli opted to keep him on the team.\nAn on-pitch brawl broke out following Colombia's 1–0 win over Brazil in their second group match; Brazilian captain Neymar deliberately kicked the ball at opponent Pablo Armero and attempted to headbutt Colombian matchwinner Jeison Murillo, earning a red card. As a result, Colombian forward Carlos Bacca retaliated by pushing Neymar over, and was himself sent off. CONMEBOL fined Neymar $10,000 and suspended him for four matches, ruling him out for the remainder of the tournament, while Bacca was suspended for two matches.\nIn Chile's quarter-final victory over Uruguay, full-back Gonzalo Jara poked Uruguayan forward Edinson Cavani in the anus, and then fell when Cavani slapped him in retaliation. Both Cavani and Jara received a yellow card for the incident, which resulted in Cavani being sent off because he had previously received another yellow card for insulting one of the referees' assistants. Jara was later suspended for two games, which made him miss the rest of the tournament. His club, Mainz 05 of Germany, criticized Jara for the incident and stated that he would be sold. However he would remain with the club until 16 January 2016 when he agreed to terminate his contract with them."

        "text": "Sherman White (December 16, 1928 – August 4, 2011) was an American basketball player at Long Island University (LIU) who is best remembered for being indicted in a point shaving scandal that resulted in him being stripped of numerous honors and awards, having to serve an 8-month jail sentence, and being prohibited from ever playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a college senior in 1950–51, White was the nation's leading scorer at 27.7 points per game and was only 77 total points shy of becoming the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) all-time single season leading scorer when he was caught, thus forcing him to prematurely quit and never getting to finish his college basketball career.\nEarly life.\nWhite was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but moved to and grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. His father was a certified refrigeration engineer who supported the family while also taking night classes. In the fall of 1943, White entered Lincoln High School in Jersey City as a freshman. After one year, however, he transferred to Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood as a sophomore and immediately became the star basketball player under coach Tom Morgan. He felt close to Morgan, would follow his directions well and always heeded his advice. As a senior in 1946–47, White guided Morrow High to an undefeated season (28–0) and a Northeastern High School championship, scored a then-New Jersey prep record 49 points in a single game, and was a unanimous first team all-state selection.\nWhite was a rather poor student; he graduated 230th in a class of 263 students. However, he had an innate ability to recall the names and statistics of the leading college basketball players in the country. Although athletic scholarships were being offered, some of the schools that showed initial interest, such as Duquesne University, rescinded their offers out of concern about his lackluster grades.\nCollege career.\nWhite sought advice from Morgan while deciding on which college to attend. Morgan was an alumnus of Villanova University, and pushed White to enroll there because he felt that the Wildcats were a good fit. Not wanting to displease his coach, a man White both respected and trusted, he agreed.\nVillanova.\nWhite arrived at Villanova in the fall of 1947. It did not take long for him to rethink his decision to attend. Villanova was a Catholic school, and at the time no other African Americans were in attendance. White did not feel comfortable. Additionally, the physical education major that he had been promised was not even an option. In his six months at the school, White received two Cs, two Ds and one F before dropping out and moving back to Englewood.\nLong Island.\nShortly after returning home, White was contacted for a second time by Long Island University (LIU) head coach Clair Bee. Bee asked him if he was still interested in playing, and after a conversation Bee \"permitted\" White to play in a scrimmage with the LIU varsity team. Despite having never competed against such a group of accomplished players, White stood out as the best player among them. He was offered a scholarship, and in February 1948 he joined the LIU freshman team for the remainder of the near-to-end season.\nBee saw to it that White, his future star, was provided the comfort and special assistance he needed. He would tip the local YMCA's janitor to make sure that the courts were open all night, for example. White, who deferred socially to his older, more street-wise teammates, became friendly with a guard, coincidentally named Eddie Gard. White liked him for his personable nature and sense of style. Gard, however, was also thievish, and it was he who ultimately got White involved in the point shaving scandal that followed.\nWhite's varsity career started inauspiciously, and it was not until the ninth game of his sophomore season that he earned a starting role. His playing time increased and so did his productivity. Although he deferred to teammates more than should have, White still managed to average 9.4 points per game (ppg) for the season. The following year as a junior (1949–50), White exploded onto the national scene. He averaged over 22 ppg, was named a Consensus Second Team All-American, was named the New York Metropolitan Area's top player by receiving the coveted Haggerty Award, and led the Blackbirds to a berth in the 1950 National Invitation Tournament. On February 28, 1950, White set still-standing LIU single game records of 63 points and 27 field goals made against John Marshall College.\nMidway through his junior season, White began to notice that several of his teammates, especially Gard, had been having consistently \"off\" games. On January 17, 1950, in a 55–52 loss to NC State, White had noticed Gard was \"giving me some bad passes.\" At the time, White did not know about, nor was participating in, the point shaving scandal. Only three players—Gard, Adolph Bigos and Dick Fuertado—were purposely trying to lose games.\nBy the time White's senior season rolled around in 1950–51, he knew about and was participating in the scandal. In a March 22, 1998 interview with \"The New York Times\", White said,\n\"After that NC State game, Eddie Gard befriends me. We sat down and started talking. He brought in Bigos and Fuertado. He gave me the same old story: 'We control the game. We're good enough to beat these guys anyway and we can make some money. They ain't giving you no money here at L.I.U.' The same old story. We can control the game and nobody will get hurt except the gamblers. Now I'm one of the guys. Peer pressure.\"\nNot wanting to be the odd man out and having succumbed to peer pressure, in addition to wanting to provide money for his poor family, White agreed to either mess up point spreads while winning, or lose games outright, during his senior year.\nPoint shaving scandal.\nEddie Gard had been contacted by Salvatore Sollazzo, the man responsible for operating the point shaving scandals at several New York City schools between the late 1940s and 1951 (City College of New York, Manhattan College, New York University and Long Island University). Sollazzo was a 45-year-old jeweler and gambler who had spent five years in prison during the 1930s. Gard's family was poor and he did not want to give up a steady income of cash, which amounted to $1,000 per player per thrown game. The original LIU players involved were Gard, Bigos and Feurtado. Eventually White and LeRoy Smith joined.\nToward the end of White's junior season he had participated in two fixes. The first was an 83–65 loss to Cincinnati, and the other was the first round in the 1950 NIT. Syracuse beat LIU 80–52, although White admitted that they were beaten soundly enough that the fix did little to decide the outcome.\nIn the early stages of the 1950–51 season, LIU players won several games that were kept close on purpose to avoid winning by more than the point spread (thus allowing bettors who wagered on their opponent to win their bets, while still allowing the team to win the game):\nSuspicions slowly began to arise that something awry was going on, not only with the Long Island Blackbirds men's basketball team, but also with the other prominent New York City programs. CCNY were losing games they were supposed to win, as were NYU and Manhattan. The public did not speak outwardly about their suspicions, although police were already conducting an investigation.\nSherman White, along with teammates Bigos and Smith, disregarded Sollazzo's intended fix for a game played on January 16 against Duquesne. The three combined for 64 points as the Blackbirds downed the Dukes, 84–52. Sollazzo supposedly lost a $30,000 bet because of it and threatened White for it to never happen again.\nGetting caught.\nOn February 18, several CCNY players that had just gotten off of a train at Penn Station after playing in Philadelphia that night were arrested. Police and detectives had researched and followed the previous several years' games and the CCNY players, respectively, that led to their arrests. Two days later, police arrested Sherman White at the Carlton YMCA in Brooklyn. White later said, \"I knew it was a matter of time. I was in a fog. As far as I was concerned, my life was shot.\" Bigos and Smith were also arrested that day.\nAftermath.\nAs soon as White was arrested, he gave back the $5,500 he had saved in an envelope that he kept in his room. He was forced to miss the last few games of the season, and at that time he was averaging 27.7 points per game and was the nation's leading scorer. He was only 77 total points from setting the new NCAA single season scoring record. When his career came to an abrupt halt, White had scored 1,435 points. On February 19, 1951—the day before his arrest—White was named the \"Sporting News\" Player of the Year. The only reason that he was still able to accept the honor was because the \"Sporting News\" had already mailed out their newest issue and it was too late to recall the magazine. Although he had been a Consensus Second Team All-American the year before, and was on track to be named a Consensus First Team All-American (and, probably, the Consensus National Player of the Year) as a senior, the NCAA refused to allow any awards or recognition to be bestowed upon any of the schools, players and coaches found to be involved in the match-fixing scandal that rocked college basketball in the late 1940s into 1951. LIU shut down its entire athletic program from 1951 to 1957 as a result of the scandal.\nJudge Saul Streit presided over the entire case involving all of the schools. When deciding all of the players' fates, Streit was noticeably hard on White. Although Eddie Gard was the primary catalyst for LIU's involvement in the gambling and point shaving, White was the only player from Long Island University to be handed more than a suspended sentence. While five other players indicted from LIU got off relatively easily, White was handed a 12-month sentence to serve in Rikers Island, the main jail in New York City typically used for rehabilitation of hardened criminals (he ended up serving 8 months and 24 days). Additionally, he and all of the other players involved in the scandal were banned from ever playing in the NBA. White recalled his feelings of the stiff sentence handed down by Judge Streit:\n\"To this day, I believe there was some kind of collaboration between my lawyer and the prosecution. Riker's [sic] Island was supposed to have been built for rehabilitation, but it was the worst place in the world for a kid to try and straighten out his life. I often wonder why I never came out of there a criminal. With all the characters and perverts I met, it certainly would have been the easy way to go.\"\nYears later, White, along with others, wondered if racism played a role in the harsh punishment. However, White admitted that he did not possess the necessary respect or humility in the courtroom that was probably necessary for the situation.\nThe man who started the whole gambling scandal, Salvatore Sollazzo, served 12 years in prison and was handed a $1,128,493 lien for evasion of taxes. One positive thing to come of the scandal, a journalist for \"Time\" wrote in the March 5, 1951 issue, was the awareness of how much influence the game had over gambling and illicit money-making ventures, which got the ball rolling to clean not just college basketball, but all college sports across the country.\nProfessional career.\nHazleton Hawks, Baltimore Bullets, and Wilkes-Barre Barons (1953–1963).\nAfter White served his sentence at Rikers Island, he played in the Eastern Professional Basketball League on the weekends. He played for the Hazleton Hawks, Baltimore Bullets and Wilkes-Barre Barons for ten seasons while simultaneously selling storm windows, automobiles and liquor. White was the EPBL Most Valuable Player in 1955 and was a five-time All-EPBL First Team selection.\nCareer statistics.\nCollege.\n\"Sherman White played during the era before many of the basketball statistics that are kept today were recorded, such as rebounds, assists, blocks, steals and turnovers.\"\nLegacy.\nSherman White was viewed as a can't-miss pick in the 1951 NBA draft. The New York Knicks were ready to select him as their territorial pick. They were ready to pay him approximately $12,000 to $13,000, a very large amount in 1951. However, shortly after he was sent to jail, he and all of the other players involved in the scandal were banned from the NBA for life.\nDue to his NBA career having ended before it started, White was mostly remembered as one of the best players in college basketball history whom no one ever saw play professionally. In 2007, TheDraftReview named him as its first \"Honorable Draftee,\" acclaiming him as \"the best basketball player you never knew\" and \"perhaps the best (college) player in New York history.\" It can only be speculated that if White had been allowed to play in the NBA, he might have been the piece needed for the Knicks to win the 1952 and 1953 NBA Finals rather than lose them both to the Minneapolis Lakers. In 1984, Madison Square Garden named White to its all-time college basketball team.\nPersonal life.\nWhite married twice, and with his second wife, Ellen, they raised six children. He also coached basketball at the Newark and East Orange YMCAs in New Jersey.\nHome Box Office (HBO) wanted to interview him for a feature-length documentary on the college basketball scandal of 1951 called \"\", but he refused. White was upset that HBO had also wrongly claimed that part of the reason for his harsher punishment compared to the other players was that he had a juvenile criminal record, which he claimed was not true.\nWhite died on August 4, 2011, in Piscataway, New Jersey, of congestive heart failure."

        "text": "The 2012 Tour de France was the 99th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in the Belgian city of Liège on 30 June and finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 22 July. The Tour consisted of 21 stages, including an opening prologue, and covered a total distance of . As well as the prologue, the first two stages took place in Belgium, and one stage finished in Switzerland. Bradley Wiggins () won the overall general classification, and became the first British rider to win the Tour. Wiggins's teammate Chris Froome placed second, and Vincenzo Nibali () was third.\nThe general classification leader's yellow jersey was worn for the first week by Fabian Cancellara (), who won the prologue. Wiggins, second in the prologue, took the leadership of the race on stage seven, the first mountainous stage, which was won by Froome, and maintained his lead for the remainder of the race, winning the two longest time trials, and not losing time to his main challengers for the overall title in the mountains.\nThe points classification was won by Nibali's teammate Peter Sagan, who won three stages. André Greipel of and rider Mark Cavendish also won three stages. 's Thomas Voeckler, winner of two mountain stages, won the mountains classification. 's Tejay van Garderen, in fifth place overall, won the young rider classification. The team classification was won by , and Chris Anker Sørensen () was given the award for the most combative rider.\nTeams.\nThe 2012 edition of the Tour de France consisted of 22 teams. The race was the 18th of the 29 events in the UCI World Tour, and all of its eighteen UCI ProTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 6 April 2012, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, of which three were French-based (, and ) and one was Dutch (). The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place outside the Prince-Bishops' Palace in Liège, Belgium, on 28 June, two days before the opening stage held in the city.\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, resulting in a start list total of 198 riders. Of these, 35 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders came from 31 countries; France, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Australia all had 12 or more riders in the race. Riders from six countries won stages during the race; British riders won the largest number of stages, with seven. The average age of riders in the race was 30.17 years, ranging from the 22-year-old Thibaut Pinot () to the 40-year-old Jens Voigt (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while cyclists had the oldest.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI ProTeams\nUCI Professional Continental teams\nPre-race favourites.\nAccording to many observers before the race the favourite for the general classification was Bradley Wiggins. His closest rivals were thought to be Cadel Evans () and Vincenzo Nibali (). Alberto Contador, the winner of both the 2007 Tour and 2009 Tour, was serving a doping suspension and did not race in the 2012 Tour. Andy Schleck, who finished second in the 2010 Tour (later promoted to the winner after Contador's result was annulled in February 2012) and 2011 Tour, was not able to recover from an injury suffered in the Critérium du Dauphiné. The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Ryder Hesjedal (), Fränk Schleck (), Samuel Sánchez (), Jurgen Van den Broeck (), Tony Martin (), Denis Menchov (), Levi Leipheimer (), Alejandro Valverde () and Robert Gesink ().\nPrior to the 2012 Tour, Wiggins's highest finishes in a Grand Tour were third in the 2011 Vuelta a España and fourth in the 2009 Tour (later promoted to third after Lance Armstrong's result was annulled in October 2012). Wiggins had shown his form in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the general classifications in three stage races in the 2012 season: the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie and the Dauphiné. As a time trialist, Wiggins was thought to be the rider most suited to the race's course. The 2011 Tour winner Evans came back from an illness earlier in the season to win the two-day Critérium International and place third at the Dauphiné. The 2010 Vuelta a España winner Nibali had shown his form in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the Tirreno–Adriatico stage race.\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins in bunch sprint finishes were Mark Cavendish (), André Greipel (), Matthew Goss (), Peter Sagan () and Marcel Kittel (). Cavendish, the world road race champion and defending points classification winner, did not have the full support of as he did in the 2011 Tour with the team; 's focus was on Wiggins' general classification ambitions. He had won the four-stage race Ster ZLM Toer 13 days before the start of the Tour. Greipel, who had the full backing of his team, had shown his form in the season with thirteen victories up to the Tour. Goss was second to Cavendish at the world championships and was the new sprint leader of his team, although he had only one win in the year up to the Tour. Sagan was equal in wins with Greipel with thirteen, of which five came in the Tour of California and four in the Tour de Suisse. Kittel won two stages in both the Tour of Oman and Ster ZLM Toer.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 29 October 2010, the ASO announced that Liège would host the 2012 edition's opening stages (known as the \"Grand Départ\"). Further details of the first three stages held in Belgium were released at an event at the city's Prince-Bishops' Palace on 18 November. Liège, which had also hosted the 2004 \"Grand Départ\", became the first city outside France to host the \"Grand Départ\" twice. The entire route of the race was accidentally published on the ASO website on 10 October 2011, eight days before the official presentation at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, the race director, Christian Prudhomme, said, \"It's a Tour designed to widen the possibilities\". The route was noted as being innovative when compared to recent years, with fewer high altitude stage finishes, and more of a focus on medium mountain stages and individual time trials. Due to a clash with the start of the Olympics at the end of July, the Tour began a week earlier than usual.\nAfter the opening prologue in Liège, stage one left the city with the finish in Seraing. The second stage took place between Visé to Tournai. The race then moved into north-west France, with the third stage ending in the coastal city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, before the fourth ended in Rouen, and the fifth in Saint-Quentin. Stage six took the race east, with the seventh ending in the Vosges Mountains. Stage eight then entered the Jura Mountains, with the finish in Porrentruy, Switzerland. A return to France saw the next stage take place between Arc-et-Senans to Besançon. The next stages, ten and eleven, went into the Alps, and stages twelve and thirteen took the Tour down to the Mediterranean coast at Cap d'Agde. Stage fourteen moved the race into the east of Pyrenees, before a transitional stage taking it to the western side of the mountains for the next two stages. Stage eighteen was held between Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde in the south of the country, before a long transfer took the race back to the north-east for two further stages, with the finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of , shorter than the 2011 Tour. The longest mass-start stage was the twelfth at , and stage 21 was the shortest at . The race featured twice the time trialling distance of the previous Tour, a total of , with the prologue, stage nine and stage nineteen. Of the remaining stages, nine were officially classified as flat, four as medium mountain and five as high mountain. There were three summit finishes: stage 7, to La Planche des Belles Filles; stage 11, to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles; and stage 17, to Peyragudes. The Col du Grand Colombier, in the Alps, was included for the first time, and was among six \"hors catégorie\" (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. The highest point of elevation in the race was the -high Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage sixteen. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage nine, in Mâcon, and fifteen, in Pau.\nRace overview.\nOpening week.\nThe opening prologue stage in Liège was won by 's Fabian Cancellara. Bradley Wiggins and Sylvain Chavanel () placed second and third respectively, both seven seconds in arrears, with Wiggins fractionally faster. Cancellara claimed the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification and the green jersey as leader of the points classification. In stage one, a large group of riders reached the final climb, the Côte de Seraing. Cancellara attacked from the finish, followed by Peter Sagan and Edvald Boasson Hagen (), before Sagan won the three-man sprint finish at the summit. Michael Mørkøv of took the first polka dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification. The next stage was won by Mark Cavendish from a bunch sprint finish in Tournai, Belgium, with Sagan taking the green jersey. Stage three, the first in France, saw Sagan win again, crossing the finish line with a comfortable margin on the short steep climb in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The fourth stage ended with a bunch sprint which was won by André Greipel. A crash with remaining took Cavendish out of contention for the stage win. Another bunch finish occurred on the next stage, with Greipel victorious again. The sixth stage was won by Sagan in another bunch sprint.\nVosges, Jura and Alps.\nIn stage seven, the first at altitude, the last of the day's breakaway riders were caught with remaining, on the final climb to La Planche des Belles Filles. A select group of five – Wiggins and his compatriot and teammate Chris Froome, Cadel Evans, Vincenzo Nibali and Rein Taaramäe () – then pulled clear in the final kilometre. Evans attacked before Froome countered and went on to win the stage and take the polka dot jersey. Cancellara lost almost two minutes on the day and surrendered the yellow jersey to Wiggins, who became the fifth British rider to wear the jersey. The eighth stage saw breakaway rider Thibaut Pinot attack a reduced break on the final climb, the Col de la Croix, and solo to the finish in Porrentruy, Switzerland, taking the victory by margin of 26 seconds. Breakaway rider Fredrik Kessiakoff () took the polka dot jersey. Stage nine's individual time trial was won by Wiggins, with Froome 35 seconds down in second and Cancellara a further 22 seconds behind in third. Froome moved up to third overall. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour.\nThe tenth stage was the first classified as mountainous. The Col du Grand Colombier broke apart a 25-rider breakaway, leaving a small group to contest the finish at Bellegarde-sur-Valserine; Thomas Voeckler () claimed the stage win and the polka dot jersey. Another mountain stage followed the next day, which again saw a large breakaway. The break crossed the two \"hors catégorie\" climbs – the Col de la Madeleine and the Col de la Croix de Fer – before being caught by the chasing group, which contained the overall contenders. A number of attacks followed, until 's Pierre Rolland escaped with to go and took the win at the Les Sybelles ski resort. The group of overall contenders followed 55 seconds later. Evans was not in the leading contenders group and, due to the time lost, he dropped from second to fourth overall, over three minutes in arrears. Kessiakoff took back the lead of the mountains classification. In stage twelve, a large breakaway formed in, before later reducing to five riders across the Col du Granier. They stayed together until the finish, where, with a kilometre remaining, David Millar () escaped to take victory, closely followed by Jean-Christophe Péraud (). The next stage finished with a bunch sprint won by Greipel, with Sagan second.\nPyrenees.\nIn the first stage in the Pyrenees, the fourteenth stage overall, a large breakaway escaped in, and at one point amassed a lead of fifteen minutes. Of the five remaining riders from the final climb of Mur de Péguère, Luis León Sánchez of attacked on an ascent with remaining and soloed to the finish in Foix. As the peloton (the main group) passed the Mur de Péguère, a large number of riders suffered tyre punctures; it was later discovered that the race course had been sabotaged with carpet tacks. Evans waited over a minute to get a replacement wheel, then had a further two punctures on the descent. As an act of sportsmanship Wiggins then forced the peloton to wait for Evans to return to the group. The next stage ran through the foothills of the Pyrenees. A five-rider breakaway made it to the finish in Pau, where with to go, Christian Vande Velde () and Pierrick Fédrigo () escaped with Fédrigo winning the sprint finish between the two cyclists. The following day was the Tour's second rest day.\nIn the sixteenth stage, the race entered the high mountains with the queen stage crossing two \"hors catégorie\" climbs – the Col d'Aubisque and the Col du Tourmalet – followed by the first-category climbs of the Col d'Aspin and the Col de Peyresourde, completing the so-called \"Circle of Death\". A 38-rider breakaway crossed the Aubisque, before fracturing on the Tourmalet. Voeckler attacked on the Peyresourde and took the stage win with a margin of one minute and forty seconds. Voeckler's stage victory and maximum points over all summits put him in the lead of the mountains classification. Wiggins, Froome and Nibali came in seven minutes after Voeckler, while Evans lost almost five minutes to the trio, falling from fourth to seventh in the general classification. In the final stage in the Pyrenees, the seventeenth, after a number of attacks on the leading group containing the overall contenders, Alejandro Valverde moved clear over the \"hors categorie\" Port de Balès. He held his lead to the summit finish at the Peyragudes ski resort. In the group behind, Wiggins and Froome attacked their rivals to finish nineteen seconds later. Nibali came in seventh, a further eighteen seconds down. In the following stage, six riders from a breakaway were caught on the finishing straight in Brive-la-Gaillarde by the head of the chasing peloton, with Cavendish taking the victory ahead of Matthew Goss and Sagan respectively.\nFinale.\nWiggins secured the general classification in the penultimate stage's individual time trial. Froome placed second, one minute and sixteen seconds in arrears, with Sánchez a further 34 seconds behind in third. In the final stage, Cavendish won his fourth consecutive Champs-Élysées stage, to record his third stage win of the race. Wiggins finished the race to become the first British rider to win the Tour de France. Wiggins finished 3 min 21 s clear of compatriot and teammate Froome. Nibali placed third at 6 min 19 s behind Wiggins. Sagan won the points classification with a total of 421, 141 ahead of Greipel in second. Voeckler won the mountains classification with 135 points, 12 ahead of second-placed Kessiakoff. The best young rider was rider Tejay van Garderen, who was followed by Pinot and Steven Kruijswijk () in second and third respectively. finished as the winners of the team classification, over 5 min 46 s ahead of second-placed . Of the 198 starters, 153 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nDoping.\nDuring the race's first rest day, the team hotel of the squad, in Bourg-en-Bresse, was searched by French police and gendarmerie. One of the team's riders in the Tour, Rémy Di Gregorio, was arrested in relation to an ongoing anti-doping case, and was immediately suspended by the French team, although the case had been open since 2011, when Di Gregorio was a member of the team. The second rest day was marked by a positive drugs test by Fränk Schleck, the third-placed rider from the 2011 Tour. Schleck was withdrawn from the race by his team after traces of xipamide, a banned sulfonamide diuretic drug, were found in the A-sample of his urine; the presence of xipamide was later confirmed by the B-sample. Subsequently, in January 2013, he was given a one-year ban by the Luxembourg Anti-Doping Agency. In July 2014, Denis Menchov was retroactively disqualified from the race by cycling's governing body, \"Union Cycliste Internationale\", for \"abnormalities in his biological passport\".\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2012 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top fifteen positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The flat stage finishes awarded a maximum of 45 points, the medium mountain stages awarded a maximum of 30 points, and the high mountain stages, time trials and intermediate sprints awarded a maximum of 20 points. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Fourth-category awarded 1 rider with 1 point; third-category awarded 2 riders, the first with 2 points; second-category awarded 4 riders, the first with 5 points; and first-category awarded 6 riders, the first with 10 points; and \"hors catégorie\" awarded ten riders, the first with 25 points. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 1, 11 and 20. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1987. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and, for first the time in the Tour's history, wore yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the prologue, the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Chris Anker Sørensen () won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.\nA total of €2,414,246 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €450,000, with the second and third placed riders getting €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains classifications were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. The team classification winners were given €50,000. There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5,000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col de la Croix de Fer in stage eleven, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage sixteen. Pierre Rolland won the Henri Desgrange and Thomas Voeckler won the Jacques Goddet.\nUCI World Tour rankings.\nRiders from the ProTeams competing individually, as well as for their teams and nations, for points that contributed towards the World Tour rankings. Points were awarded to the top twenty finishers in the general classification and to the top five finishers in each stage. Wiggins moved into the lead of the individual ranking, with Joaquim Rodríguez dropping to second. The points accrued by Chris Froome moved him from 52nd to 6th. retained their lead in the team ranking, ahead of second-place . Spain remained as the leaders of the nation ranking, with Italy second."

He has claimed five-wicket hauls (taken five or more wickets in an innings) in Test cricket on 27 occasions, second only to James Anderson among English cricketers. A five-wicket haul is regarded as a notable achievement, and 53 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Botham is generally considered one of the greatest all-rounders of all time. He was named as a \"Wisden\" Cricketer of the Year in 1978, and \"Indian Cricket\" Cricketer of the Year four years later. In 1992 he was awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE), and he was knighted for his services to cricket and charity work in 2007. Two years later, he was honoured by the International Cricket Council, who named him as one of 55 initial inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He is ninth overall in all-time Test five-wicket haul takers.\nHe made his international debut for England on 26 August 1976 in a One Day International (ODI) against the West Indies. He made his Test cricket debut just under a year later against Australia, and it was during the first innings of this match that he claimed his first international five-wicket haul. It is against Australia that he has claimed the most five-wicket hauls, doing so on nine occasions. Three of these came during the 1981 Ashes series and, along with the two centuries he scored, saw the series dubbed \"Botham's Ashes\". He twice claimed eight wickets in an innings, playing at Lord's on each occasion, against Pakistan in 1978 and the West Indies in 1984. Including these performances, Botham has collected a five-wicket haul at Lord's eight times, more so than on any other ground.\nBotham never managed to take five-wickets in an innings in ODI cricket, despite playing 116 matches and claiming 145 wickets, making him England's seventh highest wicket-taker in the format. His best return was four wickets, which he achieved on three occasions."

After a seven-year hiatus, the competition was revived following Rugby Africa's cancellation of the Africa Gold Cup in 2019 due to sponsorship loss.\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Victoria Cup was played as a trinations tournament between Kenya, Zimbabwe and Uganda on a double round-robin basis, with the teams playing home-and-away. The competition was discontinued in 2012 after Uganda and Zimbabwe withdrew due to financial difficulties.\nThe Cup is named after Lake Victoria in Kenya and Victoria Falls which were named in honour the reigning Queen Victoria and her great grandmother.\nChampions.\nThe Victoria Cup winners and runners-up from the inaugural trinations tournament of 2010 onward are listed below:\nPrecursor: 1958–2009.\nThe results of matches involving Kenya, Zimbabwe and Uganda from 1958–2009 are listed below:\nNotes.\na. Lake Victoria and the Victoria Falls are not connected contrary to some reports. The only major river that flows out of Lake Victoria is the River Nile which flows north to the Mediterranean Sea. The Victoria Falls are on the Zambezi River which begins in Zambia and runs south and east to empty in the Indian Ocean.\nb. Lake Victoria is Africa’s largest lake it is also the largest tropical lake and the second largest freshwater lake in the world. While the Victoria Falls are neither the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world, it is claimed to be the largest sheet of falling water in the world measuring some 184,500 sq meters.\nc. The 1982 match between the Zimbabwe and East Africa is often listed in popular online databases as being Zimbabwe v Kenya. In fact it was played by East Africa on the Seventh Tuskers Tour to Zambia and Zimbabwe. Though this team was almost exclusively (if not entirely) made up of Kenyan players, it is not technically a Kenya v Zimbabwe result. As the Lions is made up of players from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, so the East Africa team selects players from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. "

The consistent goalscoring of striker Dean Holdsworth returned Wimbledon to their winning ways after two mediocre seasons and they quickly re-established themselves as one of the hardest-to-beat sides in England. They finished sixth in the table - equalling their highest-ever finish - and, of all the London clubs, only Arsenal finished above them. They finished higher than much more fancied sides, including Sheffield Wednesday, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur. The only frustration endured by Dons supporters was what could have been achieved with a higher transfer budget and perhaps even their own home.\nKit.\nRibero became Wimbledon's new kit manufacturers, while London radio station LBC became the kit sponsors.

Many fine players have represented the Northern Suburbs District Cricket Club at club and representative level, such as Ian Healy and Joe Burns.\nClub history.\nIn 1925-26 the Metropolitan Electorate Cricket Competition, played under the auspices of the Queensland Cricket Association, was contested in three grades by teams representing South Brisbane, Valleys, Western Suburbs, Eastern Suburbs and Toombul Electorate Clubs as well as the University of Queensland Cricket Club.\nTo provide additional opportunities for players to participate in the competition, the number of teams competing in the \"A\" grade competition for the following season was increased to eight by the inclusion of two colts sides. Further teams were also included in the lower grades. This move was not a success and in 1927 it was decided to create a new electorate club centred on the Kelvin Grove City District, with certain areas previously covered by the Toombul, Western Suburbs and Valley Clubs being allocated to it.\nThe inaugural meeting of this club was held on 28 June 1927 and was presided over by Alderman E Lanham. It was granted affiliation with the Queensland Cricket Association for the 1927–28 season under the name of Kelvin Grove Electorate Cricket Association. In 1928 the fledgling Club changed its name to Northern Suburbs Electorate Cricket Club and subsequently became known as Northern Suburbs District Cricket Club in 1931.\nLocation.\nThe club is based at Shaw Park in the Brisbane suburb of Wooloowin.\nExecutive committee.\nThe executive committee for 2020/2021 was:\nCompetitions.\nCurrently Norths has teams entered in the following competitions:\n\"Grade - Xxxx Gold Grade Competition (2-day competition)\"\n\"One-day competitions\"\n\"Under age competitions\"\n\"Women's Competitions\"\nAwards.\nAwards for the 2009/2010 season included:\nMerit Medallions.\nEach season Norths recognises the most outstanding cricketers from the grade competition.

        "text": "Rugby union has a long history in Australia, with the first club being formed in 1863 at Sydney University. Today it holds tier one status with World Rugby and has over 82,000 players nationwide.\nEarly history and nineteenth century.\nPre-codification football.\nThere is some evidence of indigenous Australian forms of football being played in Australia, before the European arrival. Some of these involved kick and catch games. Early Europeans may well have played their own forms of traditional football as well, which involved kicking and handling. With the arrival of Europeans, a form of football was played very early on with matches being played in by 1829 in Sydney, Melbourne by 1840, Brisbane by 1849, and Tasmania by 1851. Most of these early games took part at local festivals, with no clear set of rules being used, and no codified version of any game being played. Regional versions of football were played in places like South Australia using house rules predating Victorian codification of the game. The versions played locally in this period borrowed elements from the various codes that are present today including Australian rules, soccer and rugby with the rules played being decided prior to the start of the match.\nThe first reports of a sport like rugby being played in Australia date back to the 1820s when visiting ship crews would play army teams at Barrack Square.\nAs early as 1841, there is documented evidence of \"foot-ball\" being played in metropolitan and country Victoria as well as mention of early matches in Adelaide (1843) and southern Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). The exact rules being played in these matches are unknown.\nIn 1858 English public school football games began to be played in Melbourne and surrounding districts. The earliest known such match was played on 15 June 1858 between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar School on the St Kilda foreshore. Some of these games would evolve into Australian rules football.\nRugby football and Australian rules football.\nAustralian rules football was first played in Australia in 1858. The founder of the game was Tom Wills. At the age of 14, Wills was sent to England to attend Rugby School, where he became captain of Rugby's cricket team.\nThe origins of Australian rules football are murky, with various theories being put forward, including an indigenous provenance, and an influence from Gaelic football. However, the influence of cricket is indisputable, as is the fact that Wills attended Rugby School. Geoffrey Blainey, Leonie Sandercock, Ian Turner and Sean Fagan have all written in support for the theory that the primary influence on the game was rugby football and other games emanating from English public schools.\nWriting to Wills in 1871, Thompson recalled that \"the Rugby, Eton, Harrow, and Winchester rules at that time (I think in 1859) came under our consideration, ... we all but unanimously agreed that regulations which suited schoolboys ... would not be patiently tolerated by grown men.\" The hardness of the playing fields around Melbourne also influenced their thinking. Even Wills, who favoured many rules of Rugby School football, saw the need for compromise. He wrote to his brother Horace: \"Rugby was not a game for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently.\"\nEarly rugby football.\nIn 1863, the first formal rugby football club was formed at Sydney University. In 1869, Newington College was the first Australian school to play rugby in a match against the University of Sydney. From this beginning, the first metropolitan competition in Australia developed, formally beginning in 1874. This was organised by the Southern Rugby Union, which was administered by the rugby union at Twickenham, in England. Administration was given over to the Southern Rugby Union in 1881.\nRugby began outside of Sydney first in Queensland in 1876, with the first inter-colonial match being played in Sydney in 1882. During these years the rugby that was played, was administered by the Queensland Football Association, which was the organisation administering principally the Melbourne Rules football code. Primarily due to the poor treatment rugby received by the QFA, a new organisation to oversee rugby was founded at a meeting held on 2 November 1883 at the Exchange Hotel in Brisbane. This organisation was formally constituted a decade later in 1893, as the Queensland Rugby Union.\nThe first rugby union club to be established in Australia was Sydney University's in 1863. A decade after the first club was formed, a body called the Southern Rugby Union was formed as a result of a meeting at the Oxford Hotel in Sydney, a Sydney competition was established, which was administered from the England Rugby headquarters at Twickenham. The first competition commenced the following year in 1865 with 6 teams.\nThe 'Waratah' Rugby Club invited Australian rules football club, the Carlton Football Club to play two matches, one under rugby rules and one under Australian rules. On Saturday 23 June, 3,000 spectators watched Waratah beat Carlton at rugby at the Albert Cricket Ground in Redfern. In the return leg, Carlton defeated Waratah under Australian rules. A week later over 100 footballers formed the New South Wales Football Association (NSWFA) to play the Australian game. With its origins, image and administration anchored in England, supporters of rugby saw the code as a symbol and reminder of their Englishness.\nThe first inter-colonial game occurred in 1882, when players from the four Queensland clubs (who played both rugby and Australian rules football) travelled to NSW. NSW won by 28 points to 4 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 4,000 spectators.\nOn 2 November, in 1883, the Northern Rugby Union was formed as the rugby body in Queensland after a meeting at the Exchange Hotel. As a result of the formation of the new body, several prominent GPS schools took up rugby as opposed to Melbourne Rules. That same year, the Southern Rugby Union undertook its inaugural tour of New Zealand, the following year, a New Zealand party travelled to Australia and the first club competition was held in Queensland. In 1888 the Melbourne Rugby Union was formed in Victoria. In 1892, the rugby bodies in Australia dropped Southern and Northern from their titles, adopting New South Wales and Queensland respectively. That year also saw the first British and Irish Lions tour take place, and although unsanctioned by official bodies in Europe, the 21-man squad travelled to both Australia and New Zealand.\nIn 1893, Frank Ivory was the first Indigenous Australian to play representative rugby union (for Queensland)\nIn 1899, the national team of Australia played their first match. The Hospital's Cup became an annual competition in Queensland.\nTwentieth century.\nArrival of rugby league.\nBy the time England's new \"Northern Union game\" arrived in Australia it was fundamentally different from rugby union, with lineouts, rucks and two players from each team having already been removed, and the play-the-ball introduced.\nIn 1907, the schism that more than a decade earlier, had torn the Northern Rugby Football Union from the Rugby Football Union, arrived on Australia's doorstep. Rugby union's amateur high ideals, irked the working class rugby players who sought compensation for time away from work. A meeting took place at Bateman's Crystal Hotel in Sydney on 8 August 1907, where a resolution was made to form the New South Wales Rugby Football League. They played their first season in 1908.\nSuch was the impact of the arrival of rugby league, that in 1908, when the touring Wallabies team returned from England, eleven of the players joined rugby league teams. By 1910 rugby league had overtaken rugby union in popularity.\nRecovery.\nIn 1903, Australia played its first test against the All Blacks, in front of a crowd of 30,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1907, Australia again played the All Blacks, at the same venue as the 1903 match, with crowd numbers reaching 50,000. This figure would not be surpassed again by rugby union at the ground after the start of rugby league in 1908 (the SFS commenced as the Sydney rectangular venue for rugby league and union in 1988).\nBy the time of the 1910 British Lions rugby league tour, rugby league was well entrenched as the major winter sport in all of Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, surpassing rugby union. This was a position from which rugby union would never recover in Australia.\nIn 1928 the QRU reformed, and the GPS and major clubs returned to rugby union. In 1931, the governor of New Zealand donated a sporting trophy called the Bledisloe Cup, named appropriately after Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe, for competition between Australia and New Zealand. The first game was held that year at Eden Park, though the official start of the competition is disputed between that game and the 1932 New Zealand tour to Australia.\nDuring the 1930s, the playing of sport on Sunday was banned in most of the country outside South Australia. During the 1930s, rugby league, which had gone professional, began to overtake rugby union in popularity in Queensland, with the league being the dominant spectator code by 1937.\nThe late 1940s saw the construction of a national governing body, as opposed to the NSWRU being the main organisation. In 1949, the Australian Rugby Union joined the world governing body, then known as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). Since 2017, the national governing body has been known as Rugby Australia.\nImpact of World War I.\nHeavy enlistments took their toll on the playing population of Rugby Union in Australia during World War I. The Queensland Rugby Union dissolved, and was only able to reorganise again in 1928. Such was the drop in playing numbers that the only players available during the 1920s for representing Australia were the Waratah players.\nAn event that was to greatly shape rugby union's future in Australia was the onset of World War I in 1914. While rugby league, which had been introduced to Australia in 1908, continued to play in the form of NSWRL competitions, rugby union competitions were suspended due to an overwhelmingly high percentage of rugby union players enlisting to serve in the Australian Imperial Force.\nThe enlistment of rugby union players was so quick and extensive, that by 1915, a Sydney newspaper reported: \"According to figures prepared by Mr W. W. Hill, secretary of the New South Wales Rugby Union, 197 out of 220 regular first grade players are on active service, or 90 percent.\"\nWeakened by the loss of its players to the war effort, the Queensland Rugby Union was dissolved in 1919. In the aftermath of the war, a large number of national representatives would defect to rugby league, giving rugby league a strong position in the states of New South Wales and Queensland, which it continues to maintain to this day.\n1980s and 1990s.\nIn 1987, the first ever Rugby World Cup was held in both Australia and New Zealand, as a result of both the respective rugby bodies putting forth the idea to the IRFB. Australia was defeated by France in the semifinal stage.\nIn 1995, rugby union became openly professional in Australia following an agreement between SANZAR countries and Rupert Murdoch regarding pay television rights for the game. Australia won two world cups in the 90s, the 1991 Rugby World Cup defeating England in the final, and the 1999 Rugby World Cup defeating France in the final.\nWith rugby union becoming an openly professional sport in 1995, after more than a century of being a professed amateur code, major changes were seen in both the club and international game. The Super 12 rugby competition was born that year. The tournament involved 12 provincial sides from three counties; New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. Australia entered three sides into the competition; ACT Brumbies, Queensland Reds and the New South Wales Waratahs. The year also saw the Tri Nations Series, between the three Super 12 countries.\nIn 1999, the Bledisloe Cup match between Australia and the New Zealand All Blacks was staged at the Homebush Olympic Stadium, now known as ANZ Stadium. The game attracted a then world record crowd of 107,042 for a rugby union match. In 2000 this was bettered when a crowd of 109,874 witnessed the 'Greatest ever Rugby Match' when a Jonah Lomu try sealed a 39–35 All Blacks win over the Wallabies. The All Blacks had led 24-nil after 11 minutes only to see Australia draw level at 24 all by half time.\nThe Wallabies were champions of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales, claiming their second Webb Ellis Cup trophy. In doing this, Australia became the first multiple winners of the tournament.\nThe new millennium.\nThe year 2003 saw the staging of the Rugby World Cup in Australia. Prior to the tournament, three high-profile Kangaroo rugby league players switched codes; Wendell Sailor, Mat Rogers and Lote Tuqiri. The fifth Rugby World Cup was held in various Australian cities from October to November in 2003. Matches were played all across the country, in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Townsville, Gosford, Wollongong and Launceston. The tournament was hailed as a huge success, an estimated 40,000 international spectators travelled to Australia for the event, some estimations said that a $100 million may have been injected into the Australian economy. The Australian Rugby Union said that revenues exceeded all expectations, the tournament surplus was estimated to be at $44.5 million. The hosting of the World Cup in Australia also saw an increase in Super 12 crowds and junior participation. In 2005, to celebrate a decade of professional rugby union in Australia, the Wallaby Team of the Decade was announced.\nIn 2007, the ARU launched a national competition, the Australian Rugby Championship, with eight teams—three from New South Wales, two from Queensland, and one each from the ACT, Victoria and Western Australia. The ARC was scrapped after only one season due to higher-than-expected losses of $4.7 million.\nIn late 2013, the ARU announced plans to launch a new national competition to be known as the National Rugby Championship. Originally scheduled to launch in September 2014, after the Super Rugby season and much of The Rugby Championship, the competition was expected to involve 10 teams. Player payments were expected to be considerably lower than in the former ARC, and the NRC has a broadcast contract with Fox Sports. The ARU officially unveiled the NRC in March 2014 for an August launch with nine teams; the geographic distribution was identical to that of the former ARC, with the exception of a fourth NSW team. Since then, the competition has lost one domestic team but added the Fijian Drua, a developmental side for that country's national team.\nIn 2017, the Australian Rugby Union was renamed Rugby Australia, coinciding with relocating to their new premises in Moore Park, Sydney.\nAustralian National Team.\nThe first international tour took place in 1899, when the two unions of New South Wales and Queensland played a four match series against a visiting team from the British Isles. Australia won its first match, but lost all remaining matches. The second match was played in Brisbane. Australia played its first match with New Zealand in 1903, and its second in 1907.\nBirth of the Wallaby.\nThe first international tour was organised for 1908, when a squad of players travelled nine months United Kingdom, Ireland and North America. Invited to play in the rugby tournament that was a part of the 1908 London games, Australia won the gold medal, defeating the English team.\nBledisloe Cup.\nIn 1931, Lord Bledisloe the Governor General of New Zealand, donated a rugby trophy to honor the sporting rivalry between New Zealand and Australia.\nFounding of a national union.\nBefore 1947, all administration of Australian international rugby events was performed by the New South Wales Rugby Union. State unions in 1947 determined that Australia should be served by a national union in these matters. In 1948, World Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Football Board, extended the invitation to Australia and not the New South Wales Rugby Union, to take a seat on its board. This precipitated into the formation of the Australian Rugby Football Union (ARFU). Eleven delegates from the unions in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria met on 25 November 1949 for ARFU's inaugural meeting.\nCo-hosting the first Rugby World Cup.\nThe idea of a world cup tournament for rugby had arisen several times. Possibly as early as the 1950s murmurings of a world cup tournament were made by Harold Tolhurst. In 1979 Australian Rugby Union's president Bill McLaughlin was requesting that Australia host a Rugby World Cup in conjunction with its Bicentennial celebrations in 1988. The IRFB had turned down all of these requests, forbidding any member unions from planning or attending any such events. Two separate objections have been noted, the first that the IRFB felt that the underlying amateur principle of rugby would be effected, the second that they did not want a rugby tournament being run by commercial interests.\nThese objections were laid aside in 1984, after receiving separate requests from New Zealand and Australia, to host a world cup, the IRFB decided to approve a feasibility study of a Rugby World Cup. Joining forces, New Zealand and Australia began their study on 1 December 1984. Presenting their findings to the IRFB at the Paris meeting in March 1985, the approval for a joint Rugby World Cup was hard-won. With an IRFB split evenly, it took a detractor John Kendall-Carpenter to change his vote to the affirmative, to allow the World Cup to take place.\nThe Rugby World Cup was held between 22 May to 20 June 1987."

This is a relatively rare event: only 69 hat-tricks have been scored across the 47 editions of the Copa América tournament to date. As CONMEBOL is the governing body of football in South America, official hat-tricks are only noted when CONMEBOL recognizes that at least three goals were scored by one player in one match.\nThe first hat-trick was scored by Arthur Friedenreich of Brazil, playing against Chile in the 1919 South American Championship; the most recent was by Eduardo Vargas of Chile, playing against Mexico in the 2016 Copa América Centenario.\nThe only editions not to have at least one hat-trick scored were 1916, 1917, 1920, 1921, 1922, 1937, 1956, 1979, 1983, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2019 and 2021.

In 1975, when the tournament was rebranded to its current title, a final stage using the single-elimination format was introduced, which culminates with a final match between the last two teams remaining in contention. This type of format has been used ever since, except in 1989 and 1991, which featured a final group stage.\nWith 15 titles each, Argentina and Uruguay are the most successful Copa América teams. Brazil has nine. The other champions are Paraguay, Peru and Chile, with two titles each, and Bolivia, and Colombia, who have each won one. The current champion is Argentina, having beaten Brazil in the 2021 final."

The rugby competition was held between 11 and 12 October 2010. The competition venue was the Delhi University Stadium within North Campus of the Delhi University.\nNamibia withdrew and was later replaced by Malaysia. Due to the withdrawal, Uganda was shifted to Group D while Malaysia was placed in Group C.\nFiji, described as \"perennial crowd favourites\", was absent, due to the country being suspended from the Commonwealth following the 2006 military coup.\nThere were security and health concerns surrounding the 2010 Commonwealth Games, but many main competitors had confirmed their participation."

In the fall of 1947, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association invited the RCAF to form Canada’s Olympic ice hockey squad.

Nonetheless, Forbes was a member of the team that won Canada’s first gold medal in Olympic hockey since 1932, and he was given an Olympic Gold Medal.\nHonours.\nIn 2001, Forbes was honoured by the Canadian Forces when it was announced that the 1948 RCAF Flyers were selected as Canada's greatest military athletes of the 20th century.

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2009",
        "text": "Somerset County Cricket Club competed in four domestic competitions during the 2009 English cricket season: the first division of the County Championship, the Friends Provident Trophy, the first division of the NatWest Pro40 League and the Twenty20 Cup. Through their performance in the Twenty20 Cup, the team qualified for the Champions League Twenty20. They enjoyed a successful season, but fell short of winning any competitions, prompting Director of Cricket Brian Rose to say \"We've had enough of being cricket's nearly men.\"\nConsistent performances in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until the last few weeks of the season, but the batting-friendly pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first Championship title. Consistency was also key for Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by one point in the NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.\nSomerset were captained for the third successive season by their Australian overseas player, Justin Langer, who announced during the season that it would be his last with Somerset. Marcus Trescothick topped the national batting tables, scoring almost 3,000 runs in all competitions in 2009; as a result, he was named as both Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year.\nBackground.\nAfter promotion from the second division of the County Championship in 2007, Somerset were among the first division title contenders in the 2008 County Championship. A loss to Lancashire in the final match of the season meant they finished in fourth place. David Foot, writing in \"Wisden\", claimed that too many of the Somerset batsmen had \"lost their way\" in one-day cricket, as they narrowly avoided relegation in the NatWest Pro40, and were eliminated in the Friends Provident Trophy.\nSomerset promoted four players from their academy for the 2009 season, giving contracts to Jos Buttler, Adam Dibble, Chris Jones and James Burke. Of these, only Buttler appeared in the first-team during the season. They also signed David Stiff, a fast bowler capped at Under-19 level for England, on a two-month contract at the beginning of the season, which was later extended to the end of the season. Ian Blackwell, captain of the side in 2005 and 2006, left for Durham after coach Andy Hurry and captain Justin Langer made it clear that they regarded fitness as a priority. John Francis and Keith Parsons both retired at the end of 2008, Francis cited lack of first-team opportunities for his departure, while at the age of 35, Parsons declared that: \"There comes a time when your body tells you it's time to pack in professional sport.\"\nIn his preview of the 2009 season for ESPNcricinfo, Andrew McGlashan identified Somerset's opening partnerships with bat and ball as their main strengths, but predicted that the middle order would struggle to make an impact in the County Championship, stating that \"none [of the middle order] jump out as potential match-winners in four-day cricket.\" He speculated that the team's best chance of success would come in the one-day competitions. \"The Daily Telegraph\" provided a more positive outlook, claiming that the county had \"enough depth in batting and seam bowling to challenge [for the County Championship] again.\" They identified spin bowling as an area of weakness following the departure of Blackwell. Bob Willis, writing in \"The Guardian\", shared this view, and predicted that Somerset would also be hindered by the difficulty of getting 20 wickets at home, resulting in too many draws.\nSquad.\nThe following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first-class, List A or Twenty20 cricket in 2009. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season (15 April 2009).\nCounty Championship.\nAlthough Marcus Trescothick had a season which David Foot described as \"imperiously assured\", Somerset failed to win enough matches to pose a real challenge in the 2009 County Championship. The flat pitch at the County Ground, Taunton did not help their efforts; the imbalance in favour of the batsmen meant that all but one match at the ground was drawn. Sussexs total of 742/5 declared was the fifteenth highest total in the history of the County Championship, while Murray Goodwins innings of 344 not out in that match was the sixth highest score by a batsman in the history of the competition. In total, six of Somerset's eight home matches contained scores of 500 or over in a single innings. In contrast, 500 was reached in only one of their away matches, by Hampshire at The Rose Bowl. The home conditions helped three of Somerset's batsmen pass 1,000 first-class runs in the season, including Craig Kieswetter and Arul Suppiah, who were both awarded their county caps after passing the landmark. Trescothick's 1,817 runs were the most by any batsman in the 2009 competition, finishing over 200 runs ahead of the next most prolific batsman, and he was named as both PCA Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year for 2009. He was also selected as part of the team of the year, along with wicket-keeper Kieswetter.\nIn contrast to the strong batting line-up, Foot suggested that Somerset \"lacked a seam bowler to compensate for Andrew Caddicks withdrawal\". Caddick—who made his first-class debut for Somerset in 1991—only played five matches in 2009, and announced his intention to retire at the end of the season. He took ten wickets in 2009, and finished his career as Somerset's sixth highest wicket-taker of all time. This placed the majority of the wicket-taking burden upon Charl Willoughby, the South African fast-medium pace bowler. He responded well, and took 54 wickets in the County Championship, more than any other bowler in the first division. He was aided by seam bowlers David Stiff, who returned to the first-class game for the first time since 2006, and Alfonso Thomas. Stiff took 31 wickets, more than quadrupling his career first-class wicket total, and Thomas took 35, his highest return in an English domestic season. Somerset lacked an effective spin bowler in 2009 following the departure of Ian Blackwell the previous season, and the spinners combined only claimed 31 wickets, bowling less balls between them than Willoughby alone.\nSomerset began their season by playing out a high-scoring draw at home against Warwickshire, in which both teams reached 500 in their first innings. James Hildreth scored a triple-century, reaching the milestone earlier in an English season than any player previously, and became the first English player to pass 300 runs in an innings for Somerset since Harold Gimblett in 1948. In contrast, Somerset had to battle back for a draw in their second match. After Durham scored 543 in their first innings, Somerset collapsed to 69 all out in reply; only Langer passed 20 runs, while six of his batting colleagues made ducks. After being forced to follow-on, Trescothick, Langer and Kieswetter all scored centuries to secure a draw. Somerset's third match resulted in their only loss of the County Championship season, coming against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge; and at the end of May, they were second bottom in the first division. Their next match finished in a draw against Lancashire, a result which was always likely after the first day was lost to rain. Somerset next picked up victories against Yorkshire and Sussex before scoring the second-highest ever fourth innings winning total in the County Championship to beat Yorkshire at Taunton. These three wins propelled Somerset to third in the competition at the start of July, and they did not drop below this position for the remainder of the season.\nIn each of their following two matches, at home against Hampshire and away to Worcestershire, Somerset batted first and then enforced the follow-on after bowling their opponents out cheaply. In each their opponents managed to avoid defeat, and both matches resulted in draws. During the Worcestershire match, Langer's first innings 107 took him past Sir Donald Bradman's total of 28,067 first-class runs to become the highest-scoring Australian batsman. Successive draws against Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Hampshire meant that Somerset travelled to Durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the County Championship title. No play was possible on the third and fourth days, and the match resulted in another draw, leaving Somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of the title. Another draw, against Lancashire, while Durham beat Nottinghamshire, meant that Durham clinched the title. Somerset drew with Worcestershire (their ninth draw in a row in the competition), and finished third in the first division.\nSeason standings.\n\"Key: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, D = Draws, T = Ties, A = Abandonments, Bat = Batting points, Bwl = Bowling points, Adj = Adjustments/Penalties, Pts = Points.\"\nAdjustments:\nHampshire deducted 3 points for a slow over-rate in their match against Worcestershire.\nDurham deducted 1 point for a slow over-rate in their match against Sussex.\nSomerset deducted 1 point for a slow over-rate in their match against Durham.\nSussex deducted 1 point for a slow over-rate in their match against Worcestershire.\nNotes:\nTeam marked won the County Championship.\nTeams marked were relegated to Division Two of the County Championship.\nFriends Provident Trophy.\nIn the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy, the first one-day competition in the English domestic calendar, Somerset showed a marked improvement from the previous season. They were described by Steve James, writing in \"Wisden\", as \"the most impressive qualifiers\" from the group stage, and both Trescothick and Kieswetter were praised for their batting form. They were the only side in the competition to remain unbeaten in the group stages, finishing with seven victories and one no result. In the quarter-final, against Group C runners-up Sussex, Somerset won the toss and opted to bat at Taunton. They struggled initially, losing the early wickets of Trescothick, James Hildreth and Ben Phillips for just 39 runs. A fourth-wicket partnership of 167, dominated by powerful hitting from Kieswetter in which he scored a \"superb century\" according to ESPNcricinfo's Andrew McGlashan, helped Somerset to recover to make 285/8, but Sussex chased the total down in the final over to eliminate the home side.\nDuring the group stages of their campaign, Somerset achieved a number of large victories. They won by eight wickets against Warwickshire and Middlesex, and by more than a hundred runs against Kent and Scotland. Their match against Middlesex at Lord's was marred by some controversy, after Somerset were allowed too many powerplay overs in the rain-affected fixture. \nSomerset were set a reduced target of 290 off 41 overs, of which 19 were allocated by the umpires as being powerplay overs, three more than there should have been. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) rejected Middlesex's request to replay the match, stating that they were upholding \"the precedent that umpire errors cannot form the basis to declare a match null and void\".\nThe two matches played against Middlesex were in stark contrast; in the match played at the Recreation Ground, Bath, Somerset bowled the London side out for 65, the joint second-lowest total made against Somerset in a List A match, while the 341/7 which Middlesex made at Lord's was the fourth-highest total scored against Somerset in the format. Somerset themselves scored their second-highest List A total, amassing 403/3 against Scotland, a game in which Hildreth scored 151, his highest List A score, and Somerset's highest score by a batsman at number three in List A cricket.\nZander de Bruyn finished the competition with the highest batting average amongst batsmen who played five or more innings. Four Somerset batsmen scored over 300 runs in the tournament (Trescothick, 476; Kieswetter, 395; de Bruyn, 388; Hildreth, 313), more than any other county except eventual winners Hampshire. Amongst the bowlers, Alfonso Thomas finished as the tournament's joint leading wicket-taker, claiming 20 wickets to finish level with Chris Schofield and Dominic Cork. Peter Tregos 18 wickets were the next most in the competition.\nSeason standings.\n\"Key: Pld = Played, W = Wins, T = Ties, L = Losses, NR = No result, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nNotes:\nTeams marked progressed to the next stage of the competition.\nTeams marked were eliminated from the competition.\nTwenty20 Cup.\nSomerset finished as runners-up to Sussex in the 2009 Twenty20 Cup, having reached Finals Day in what captain Justin Langer described as \"bizarre\" fashion. Somerset qualified for the knock-out stages of the competition as the best third-placed team during the group stage, then beat Lancashire in a bowl-out to qualify for the semi-finals. After overcoming Kent in the semi-final, Somerset were comprehensively beaten by Sussex in the final.\nAfter the Indian Premier League's second season demonstrated the importance of spin bowling in Twenty20 cricket, and due to Somerset's lack of a front-line spin bowler, Somerset picked young leg spinner Max Waller to make his Twenty20 debut in their opening match of the campaign. He claimed three wickets in two overs to help Somerset win by one run, and finished the competition as Somerset's joint second-highest wicket-taker with 10 wickets. Despite a number of good performances by Somerset's bowlers, a batsman was named man of the match in each of the team's victories: James Hildreth, Craig Kieswetter and Marcus Trescothick were all awarded the accolade once, while Zander de Bruyn picked up the award on three occasions. Somerset completed the group stage with six wins, three losses and one no result, placing them third in the Midlands/Wales/West Division. They qualified for the knockout-stage as they were the best third-placed team in the three groups.\nSomerset's quarter-final, against Lancashire, was scheduled for Tuesday 28 July 2009. Bad weather meant that no play was possible on either the Tuesday or Wednesday, as a result of which the teams requested special dispensation from the ECB for an additional reserve day on the Thursday, which was granted. The wet weather continued, forcing the teams to play a bowl-out. Each team had to select five bowlers, each of whom had two deliveries at a set of unguarded stumps. Somerset won the bowl-out 5–1, with Ben Phillips, Peter Trego and Willoughby each hitting the stumps once, and Thomas hitting them twice.\nIn the second semi-final of 2009 Finals Day, Somerset won the toss and elected to field against Kent. Economical bowling from Thomas and Willoughby, as well as the early wickets of Joe Denly and Martin van Jaarsveld, helped to limit Kent to 145/5. On a slow pitch, Trescothick played what ESPNcricinfo's Andrew McGlashan described as a \"brutal innings\", scoring 56 runs off 32 balls. He shared an opening partnership of 73 with captain Langer, and by the time of Trescothick's dismissal after 8.1 overs, Somerset required 62 runs off 71 balls. Hildreth and de Bruyn took 10 overs to add another 57 runs, and after Hildreth was bowled for 36, Kieswetter added two runs to grant Somerset victory with seven balls remaining. Against Sussex in the final, Somerset once again won the toss and elected to field. A strong batting display by Sussex, highlighted by Dwayne Smith's 59 runs off 26 balls, set Somerset a target of 173 to win. In the opening overs of Somerset's reply, Trescothick scored powerfully, making the chase \"look simple\" according to McGlashan. However, after he was caught on 33, Somerset lost regular wickets. A partnership of 41 between de Bruyn and Trego steadied Somerset for a time, but when the pair were dismissed in subsequent overs, their team collapsed from 104/4 to 109 all out.\nAt the start of the competition, Somerset played with aggressive batting tactics, opening the innings with Kieswetter and Trescothick for the first six matches. This opening pair only passed 20 runs together on one occasion, against Glamorgan, and for the rest of the tournament, Kieswetter dropped down the batting order and Langer joined Trescothick at the top of the innings, in a move that Kieswetter said \"adds a bit of balance to the side by putting a bit more firepower down the end and experience up top\". The more experienced pair passed 40 runs together on four out of five occasions. The county's bowling relied heavily on medium pace, a fact which cricket writer Scyld Berry suggested was exposed in the final.\nSeason standings.\n\"Key: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, NR = No result, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nNotes:\nTeams marked progressed to the next stage of the competition.\nTeams marked were eliminated from the competition.\nNatWest Pro40.\nSomerset's first match of the 2009 NatWest Pro40, against Nottinghamshire, ended just one over short of the requirement for a match. Chasing 248 to win, Somerset were significantly behind the required rate when rain halted play in the ninth over. The side responded positively to this stroke of luck, winning their next three matches by significant margins, before losing to Essex. Having been put in to bat at Taunton, each of Somerset's top six batsman reached double figures, but none of them managed to pass 50 and the home side were eventually all out for 205. Despite taking early wickets during Essex's innings—at one stage having the visitors 12/3—the batting of John Maunders, James Foster and Tim Phillips propelled Essex past Somerset's total with five balls remaining. Two further victories ensured that Somerset entered their final match of the season with a chance to win the title.\nSomerset had performed well but missed out narrowly in both the other one-day competitions in 2009, and could have clinched the competition with victory in their final match. News filtered through to the County Ground during their final match, against Durham, that leaders Sussex had lost to Worcestershire, meaning that a win against the north-eastern team would guarantee Somerset the title. The result rarely looked likely; a rapid opening to the chase by Durham openers Phil Mustard and Ian Blackwell provided a platform for their team to claim victory, and deny Somerset the title. Three of Somerset's bowlers claimed ten or more wickets in the competition (Ben Phillips, 14; Alfonso Thomas, 13; Charl Willoughby, 11), more than any other county in Division One.\nSeason standings.\n\"Key: Pld = Played, W = Wins, T = Ties, L = Losses, NR = No result, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nNotes:\nTeam marked won the NatWest Pro40.\nChampions League Twenty20.\nBy finishing as runners-up in the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset qualified to compete in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, the first global club cricket tournament. Media attention surrounded Trescothick, who had returned home early from his last overseas tour in 2006–07 with a \"stress-related illness\". Brian Rose stressed that there was no pressure on Trescothick to take part in the tournament, and that the county would do everything possible to support him. The former England batsman did take part in the tournament, arriving three days after the rest of the squad. He played in both of Somerset's matches in the group stage of the competition, though he only managed to score 17 runs between his two innings.\nSomerset won their first match, in which Alfonso Thomas scored two boundaries off the last three balls of the match to secure victory. Their opponents, Deccan Chargers scored 153 off their 20 overs, and with three wickets remaining, Somerset required 55 runs off 37 balls to win. A record eighth-wicket partnership between James Hildreth and Thomas of 50 brought the victory within reach, and Thomas' highest-score in Twenty20 cricket granted Somerset the win. Somerset lost their second match, being bowled out for their second-lowest Twenty20 total, 106 by Trinidad and Tobago.\nSomerset progressed to the second round of the competition after Trinidad and Tobago beat Deccan in the final group match, but lost Trescothick, who flew home after a recurrence of his illness. Wes Durston, who replaced Trescothick in the side, top-scored for Somerset in their next match, making 57. Only two other players reached double-figures for the county, and the Diamond Eagles chased down the total with eight balls to spare. Somerset went into their final match, against the New South Wales Blues with a slim mathematical chance of progressing, but a strong bowling display from Brett Lee and Stuart Clark restricted Somerset to 111, which the Australian side reached with ease.\nSeason standings.\n\"Key: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, NR = No result, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nNotes:\nTeams marked progressed to the next stage of the competition.\nTeams marked were eliminated from the competition.\nNotes:\nTeams marked progressed to the next stage of the competition.&lt;br&gt;\nTeams marked were eliminated from the competition.&lt;br&gt;\nReaction.\nAfter the conclusion of the Champions League tournament, Justin Langer retired from professional cricket. Trescothick replaced him as Somerset captain for the 2010 season. Somerset also lost Andrew Caddick to retirement. Wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard also announced his retirement at the end of the season aged 27, having lost his place in the Somerset side to Craig Kieswetter. Additionally, Somerset released Wes Durston and Omari Banks, both of whom they felt were surplus to requirements. Somerset addressed the weakness of their spin bowling by signing Murali Kartik as their overseas player for 2010.\nKieswetter's performances in the 2009 season led to his inclusion in the England Performance Programme squad in November and December of that year, and he was part of the England Lions squad which toured the United Arab Emirates in early 2010, along with Somerset team-mate Peter Trego. His full England debut came shortly after in Bangladesh. Additionally, two of Somerset's young players, Jos Buttler and Calum Haggett played for England Under-19s during the English winter.\nFinancially, Somerset broke even in 2009, generating a gross turnover of £4.5 million. The club achieved this despite carrying out significant building work on the County Ground during the period: the \"Somerset Stand\", a 3,000-seat grandstand opened in April, while the \"Andy Caddick Pavilion\" was completed just over a month later, providing new dressing rooms and club offices. Andy Nash, the Somerset chairman, highlighted the catering department and match-day income as being particularly successful in 2009, with both areas exceeding £1 million in revenue during the year."

        "text": "The 2010 Tour de France begins on 3 July in Rotterdam in the Netherlands with a prologue time trial, and stage 10 occurs on 14 July, with a medium mountain stage in Gap.\nPrologue.\n3 July 2010 — Rotterdam (Netherlands), (individual time trial)\nThis time trial was short and nearly totally flat, with two very small rises in elevation (the first for the crossing of the Erasmus Bridge) occurring in the first half of the course. Tony Martin of led for most of the stage, being the eleventh person to complete the prologue. It was not until world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara, the second-to-last rider of the day, took the course that Martin's time was bettered. Rain showers plagued the middle portion of the stage, but for the riders who started at the end the rain had stopped and the course was primarily dry. This was Cancellara's fourth win in a time trial to start the Tour de France in his career. Martin's efforts did not go unrewarded; he was awarded the white jersey for best young rider.\nPrologue result and general classification after prologue\nStage 1.\n4 July 2010 — Rotterdam (Netherlands) to Brussels (Belgium), \nThis stage is flat, winding through the islands of Zeeland before heading south into Belgium before the finish in the nation's capital. It was thought that the winds from the North Sea would cause some mayhem for this very flat stage, but this did not happen. Just after the peloton passed the stage's true beginning three riders broke away from the pack. Those riders were Lars Boom of , Maarten Wijnants of , and 's Alan Pérez. The trio stayed in front of the peloton for over . With about to go, Wijnants sprinted away from the other two breakaway members, who were quickly taken in by the charging peloton. Moldova road race champion Alexandre Pliușchin, representing , escaped from the peloton and joined Wijnants with about left in the stage. The two gained a maximum advantage of a minute over the peloton, and were caught with to go. As the peloton turned around a right hand bend, with under remaining, there was a small crash that took out two top sprinters, Mark Cavendish and Óscar Freire. Further crashes occurred in the stage's final kilometer, and riders high in the overall standings such as Lance Armstrong and Fabian Cancellara were caught up in them, along with many others. The few riders who were in front of the crash sprinted to the line, with 's Alessandro Petacchi claiming his first Tour de France stage win since 2003. Wijnants was named the most combative rider for Stage 1. All 158 riders who were together when the peloton passed through to go were given the same time regardless of when they actually finished.\nStage 2.\n5 July 2010 — Brussels (Belgium) to Spa (Belgium), \nThere are six categorized climbs in this stage, three each in the third and fourth categories. The finish comes off the descent of the Rosier Pass, visited before the conclusion of the stage. Just after passing through kilometer zero, an eight-man breakaway formed. The riders that made up the breakaway were Sylvain Chavanel and Jerome Pineau of , Matthew Lloyd and Jürgen Roelandts both from , 's Marcus Burghardt, Sébastien Turgot of , Rein Taaramäe , and 's Francesco Gavazzi. As the breakaway passed through the classification four mountains Jerome Pineau picked up enough climbing points to earn the polka dot jersey at the end of the stage, and the first polka jersey of the Tour. By the time the breakaway reached the Stockeu Sylvain Chavanel was by himself, having dropped Jürgen Roelandts who later got reabsorbed into the peloton. As the peloton caught Burghardt, 's Maxime Monfort jumped off the front of the peloton. On the descent of the Stockeu several crashes occurred. Francesco Gavazzi, who was reabsorbed by the peloton, slipped and fell to the ground causing a crash that took down GC contender Andy Schleck, the points competition leader Alessandro Petacchi, and most of the peloton. The riders that came out of the wreckage unscathed went on with the stage, but began to wait for the other riders that were involved in the crash. Most of the peloton regrouped, but they didn't try to chase down Sylvain Chavanel. While approaching the finish line the peloton caught Monfort, the only remaining escapee other than Chavanel. Fabian Cancellara called for the peloton to not go for the sprint finish, out of fairness to those who had crashed and concern for the safety of the riders who might contest the sprint. As a result, no sprint points were awarded at the finish except to Chavanel, the stage winner, who was not involved in the slowdown.\nThis was his second career Tour de France stage victory, and along with the stage win he became the overall leader and the leader of the points classification.\nStage 3.\n6 July 2010 – Wanze (Belgium) to Arenberg Porte du Hainaut, \nThis is a difficult stage, incorporating of cobblestones in seven cobbled sectors over the last .

The peloton and the breakaway passed over the first few sets of cobbles with no problem. Ryder Hesjedal soon jumped off the front of the breakaway, leaving the remaining to get picked up by the peloton. Then as Fabian Cancellara took the reins of the peloton and began to whip up the pace; a crash occurred. The crash took out most of the peloton, except for the few who were in front of Fränk Schleck. Fränk Schleck and a few other riders went to the ground, taking up the whole road. Later, Fränk Schleck would abandon the Tour with a broken collarbone.\nAs Cancellara, Cadel Evans, Andy Schleck, and Thor Hushovd sped away, the rest of the field was trying to pick their way around the pileup. This created some distance between the GC hopefuls, such as Alberto Contador and Lance Armstrong. Initially Contador was knocked off of his bike. As the whole field made its way past the wreckage there were now two pelotons. Armstrong was initially in the first bunch of riders, but dropped off the back after needing a front wheel change. Contador fought back to the first main field, which was further up the road than the second peloton. Armstrong charged back, only to join the second peloton, and ultimately lost two minutes of time to the winners, and one minute to Contador. Ryder Hesjedal was caught by the chase group, led by Cancellara, with to go in the stage. The group made its way to the line where Thor Hushovd won the stage, also taking the lead in the points classification. Cancellara took the overall lead back from Sylvain Chavanel. Over a minute later Alexander Vinokourov led the second group over the line, with Contador coming in a few seconds later due to a flat tyre. Two minutes after Hushovd crossed the line, the group containing Armstrong crossed the line.\nStage 4.\n7 July 2010 — Cambrai to Reims, \nThis stage is short and mostly flat, undulating gently for its duration and incorporating one fourth-category climb. The stage got off to a normal start, with a five-man group jumping off the front of the peloton to form a breakaway. Those five riders were Dimitri Champion of , Iban Mayoz of , Nicolas Vogondy of , Francis De Greef of and 's Iñaki Isasi. The peloton would not let the breakaway gain more than three minutes advantage on them, but they stayed out in front until the final kilometres. The breakaway dropped De Greef with just under remaining in the stage. As the sprinters teams were gearing up for the sprint finish, they absorbed the remaining breakaway members. As the sprinters came to the line Alessandro Petacchi jumped off of Thor Hushovd's back wheel and sprinted to the line for the stage win.\nStage 5.\n8 July 2010 — Épernay to Montargis, \nThis is another flat stage, with two fourth-category climbs occurring early on. Stage 5 got off to a normal start, 6 km into the stage the riders broke away from the peloton. Jurgen Van De Walle of , José Ivan Gutierrez Palacios of , and 's Julien El Fares made up the three man breakaway. The breakaway gained a maximum advantage of eight minutes before being pulled back in by the peloton. As the final kilometers were approaching, Van De Walle and El Fares were caught by the peloton. Gutierrez remained out in front for only a little while longer, until being caught. Then the sprinters teams fought for position. As the teams came down to the final stretch; Mark Renshaw lead out Mark Cavendish for the stage win. This was Cavendish's eleventh Tour de France stage win of his career.\nStage 6.\n9 July 2010 — Montargis to Gueugnon, \nThis stage is also classified flat, though it contains a bit more climbing than the previous stages. There are four fourth-category climbs on the course, and other less steep uncategorized rises. Just 3 km after passing through kilometer zero a three-man breakaway formed. Those three riders were Mathieu Perget of , Sebastian Lang of and 's Rubén Pérez. The breakaway would gain a maximum advantage of eight minutes on the day. As the stage went on the gap slowly went down and the sprinters teams started preparing for a sprint finish. With 20 km to go in the stage Dimitri Champion of and Anthony Charteau of broke away from the peloton and joined the breakaway. The two riders would help stretch out the gap between the breakaway and the peloton, but not for long. The sprinters teams reeled in the breakaway just after passing under the 10 km to go banner. Then the sprinters and their lead out trains came to the front for the sprint finish. Mark Renshaw led out Mark Cavendish for his second consecutive stage win. Carlos Barredo and Rui Costa came to blows after the stage.\nStage 7.\n10 July 2010 — Tournus to Station des Rousses, \nThe Tour's first stage in the mountains has six climbs in the Jura, three in the second category, two in the third, and one in the fourth. The two most difficult climbs are the last two, the Col de la Croix de la Serra and the Lamoura, both second-category climbs reaching over in elevation. of flat racing follow the Lamoura climb before the stage finish. After numerous failed attempts at forming a breakaway; a five-man breakaway formed 2 km into the stage. The breakaway was composed of Danilo Hondo of , Samuel Dumoulin of , Rubén Pérez of , Christian Knees of , and King of the Mountains classification leader Jérôme Pineau of . Hondo crossed the first three intermediate sprints of the stage first. Sylvain Chavanel crossed the fourth and final intermediate sprint of the stage first. Pineau crossed the first five classified mountains first, increasing his lead in the King of the Mountains classification. On the ascent of the second to last climb of the day, the Col de la Croix de la Serra, everyone started attacking and other riders started to fall off the back of the peloton at an alarming rate. When the peloton reached the penultimate climb a large group of riders jumped off the front of the peloton to chase after Pineau and the slowing Hondo. When the breakaway reached the final mountain the breakaway only contained two riders, Pineau and Hondo. On the final climb Pineau had climbed away from Hondo; who was beginning to crack. Sylvain Chavanel was a member of the chase group that broke away from the peloton on the Col de la Croix de la Serra. Chavanel attacked and started gaining ground fast, he quickly caught Hondo and then his own teammate Pineau. Chavanel would go on by himself to claim the stage win, his second of this year's Tour, and the maillot jaune. Pineau won the most combative rider of Stage 7.\nStage 8.\n11 July 2010 — Station des Rousses to Morzine-Avoriaz, \nStage 8 was the Tour's first taste of the Alps. Starting at the previous day's concluding town of Station des Rousses, the stage incorporated two Category 1 climbs: the Col de la Ramaz which crested with left to race and the summit finish at Morzine-Avoriaz. As the stage wore on, groups began form off the back of the peloton. set a blistering pace on the ascent of the Les Gets, this caused a group of elite riders to form a trailing group. Soon Lance Armstrong, after crashing twice in the stage, dropped off the back of the peloton. Once word reached they took control of the lead elite group, whipping up the pace. This group contained Alberto Contador, Andy Schleck, Cadel Evans, and about 30 others. Once the group reached the flamme rouge, attacks began, aiming at the stage win. Andy Schleck attacked, with Samuel Sánchez trailing him. Schleck out-sprinted Sánchez at the finish for his first Tour stage win. Cadel Evans took the yellow jersey gaining from Sylvain Chavanel.\nStage 9.\n13 July 2010 — Morzine-Avoriaz to Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, \nAfter the first rest day, at Morzine-Avoriaz, the next Alpine stage contains one of this Tour's hardest climbs, the hors catégorie Col de la Madeleine.

The peloton did not really make an effort to catch the breakaway, letting the breakaway's advantage rise to the twelve-minute mark for most of the stage. As the breakaway passed under the 10 km to go banner, the breakaway members began to attack. The first attack was by Devenyns, but he was soon passed. Paulinho sprinted in front of Devenyns, and Kiryienka followed closely behind. The two would gain a minutes advantage over the other riders that were in the chase group.

The stage got off to a normal start with a three-man breakaway forming just after passing through kilometer zero. The three riders were Stéphane Augé of , Anthony Geslin of , and 's José Alberto Benítez. The breakaway would stay out in front for the majority of the stage, but they were absorbed by the peloton with to go. Now it was time for the sprinters, but took control of the peloton and pushed the tempo up to 62 km/h. Then the sprinters' teams came to the front and started the dash to the line. Mark Renshaw led out Mark Cavendish for the thirteenth Tour de France stage win of his career. In a controversial decision Renshaw was disqualified and forced to abandon the Tour for head butting Julian Dean during the sprint and for moving into Tyler Farrar's line.\nStage 12.\n16 July 2010 — Bourg-de-Péage to Mende, \nThis stage is hilly, with two second-category and three third-category climbs. The Col de la Croix Neuve comes from the finish, followed by a brief flat section.

Some major riders were Thor Hushovd of , Andreas Klöden of , and Alexander Vinokourov of . Hushovd regained the lead in the points classification after winning the second intermediate sprint of the day. With about 48 km to go in the stage Klöden, Vinokourov, 's Ryder Hesjedal, and Vasil Kiryienka of jumped off the front of the breakaway. The group would stay intact until the final climb of the day where Vinokourov would attack on the climb. While on the climb Alberto Contador attacked, which caught Andy Schleck off guard. Joaquim Rodríguez followed Contador, who quickly caught up to the leading Vinokourov. Contador and Rodriguez would go to the finish together, with Rodriguez outsprinting Contador for the stage win. Contador gained ten seconds on Schleck.\nStage 13.\n17 July 2010 — Rodez to Revel, \nThis is classified as a flat stage, though it incorporates five climbs, two in the third category and three in the fourth.\nStage 14.\n18 July 2010 — Revel to Ax 3 Domaines, \nThe first of several difficult stages in the Pyrenees in the Tour's last week visits the French Basque Country.

The finish comes on a steep, descent from the climb.\nIn Stage 15, controversy arose when Alberto Contador took advantage of a mechanical problem that Andy Schleck had at a pivotal moment to take the yellow jersey, as it is considered good sportsmanship to wait for the yellow jersey when he has technical trouble. Contador explained that he did not know that Schleck had technical trouble, and that he had already launched an attack by then. Hours later, he apologised for the incident. Although he was loudly booed by sections of the crowd when he received the yellow jersey on the podium and was criticised by Sean Kelly and a number of riders both past and current, he also found support from the likes of Bernard Hinault, Miguel Induráin, Eddy Merckx and Laurent Jalabert. Schleck himself said that he and Contador discussed the matter during the next stage and that the matter has been resolved.\nStage 16.\n20 July 2010 — Bagnères-de-Luchon to Pau, \nThis stage has four difficult climbs, starting with the first-category Col de Peyresourde and Col d'Aspin within the first .

This has been called the Tour's queen stage, and features the second ascent of the Tourmalet, coming as a steep summit finish. The first-category Col de Marie-Blanque and Col du Soulor climbs precede it. Anthony Charteau provisionally sealed the Polka-dot Jersey, as neither he nor Christophe Moreau accumulated any points during this stage, which featured the final categorized climbs of this year's Tour. The stage itself turned into a thrilling battle between Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador. With Schleck needing to make up lost time on Contador, he launched numerous attacks in the final 15 kilometres. However, surrounded by his fans, Contador fought to stay on the wheel of Schleck. Late on, Contador attacked himself but was pulled back. Schleck went on to take the stage, but Contador, who was happy to follow Schleck and did not sprint, had a seemingly unassailable lead.\nStage 18.\n23 July 2010 — Salies-de-Béarn to Bordeaux, \nThis was a flat stage.\nStage 19.\n24 July 2010 — Bordeaux to Pauillac, (individual time trial)\nThe race returns to its tradition of having a time trial on its penultimate day. The course is long, straight, and flat. Race officials expect the average time to complete the course will be 64 minutes. Fabian Cancellara took his second victory of the tour, whilst Tony Martin finished second. The battle between Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck for the yellow jersey also reached its climax. With Contador being the more accomplished Time-Trialist, he was expected to increase his lead. However, at the first time check, Schleck had taken time out of him and the lead was down to two seconds. However, from there on in, Contador began to open a gap, and ended picking time up 31 seconds on Schleck, meaning his Yellow Jersey was now safe.\nStage 20.\n25 July 2010 — Longjumeau to Paris, \nThe Tour concluded with its traditional, largely ceremonial finale on the Champs-Élysées.

        "text": "The sport of boxing has been practised in Canada since before Canadian Confederation in 1867. Boxing was illegal in Canada during the bare-knuckle era but fights took place in remote areas and the last of them was in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1901.\nTommy Burns from Normanby Township near Hanover, Ontario, was the first Canadian to win the world heavyweight title, becoming the champion in 1906 and defending the title thirteen times until he was defeated via Referee's decision by Jack Johnson on Boxing Day December 26, 1908 at Rushcutters Bay, Sydney NSW Australia. On May 10, 2014, Bermane Stiverne won the vacant WBC World Heavyweight Championship after a sixth-round knockout of Chris Arreola.\nGoverning bodies.\nThere is currently a debate in Canadian boxing circles regarding the oldest active professional championship sanctioning body. The National Championship of Canada (NCC) claims to be the legitimate continuation of the Canadian Boxing Federation (CBF) title, which was dissolved to avoid any conflict with the organization's goals regarding safety and regulation. The CBF title dates back to 1925. The Canadian Professional Boxing Council (CPBC) also claims to be the oldest active sanctioning body in Canada, tracing its history back to 1976. The CPBC rejects the NCC's claim to the CBF's history. As of 2016, the CPBC is the more active of the two bodies, while a certain degree of prestige continues to surround the NCC title thanks to champions like Brandon Cook, Sylvera Louis, and Dillon Carman.\nBoxing Canada is the national governing body for the sport of boxing in Canada recognized by the Canadian Olympic Committee."

        "text": "The Kanga Cricket League (officially the Dr. H. D. Kanga Memorial Cricket League) is a cricket competition in Mumbai, India, inaugurated in 1948. It is named after Hormasji Kanga, who played 43 First class cricket matches as an all-rounder, and was also a selector for the India national cricket team\nOrigins.\nThe Kanga League was founded in 1948, and is held in Mumbai between July and October, during the Indian monsoon season. As such, the grounds are very unpredictable, and can often be very wet, meaning the ball can \"stop, shoot, skid and swing - all in a day's play.\" Shishir Hattangadi has remarked that \"If a batsman scored 30 or 50 runs, it would be considered equivalent to an 80 or a 100.\" Vijay Merchant has been suggested as the founder of the league, and the league was named after Bombay cricketer Hormasji Kanga. Kanga was the first Indian to score a double century in a first-class match. He also worked as the President of the Bombay Cricket Association and was the vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\nHistory.\nThe league has featured many Indian Test cricketers, including Buck Divecha, Dattu Phadkar and Sunil Gavaskar. Aged 11, Sachin Tendulkar appeared in the league representing John Bright Cricket Club, and in 1985–86, he played the whole season aged 12. Sachin's son Arjun Tendulkar made his Kanga League debut aged 13 in 2013. Bombay and Indian Test batsman Madhav Apte played in every Kanga League between 1948 and 2002, and wicket-keeper Mehli Irani played in the Kanga League for 50 years, retiring at the age of 68. Zaheer Khan debuted in the 1996 Kanga League aged 18, and bowled 10 consecutive maiden overs in a match. In a Kanga League Division A match in November 2014, Pardeep Sahu took all ten wickets in an innings, becoming the fourth bowler to do so in the league. The 2013 and 2014 Kanga Leagues were scheduled at the end of the monsoon season, but the league was moved back into the monsoon season in 2015.\nRecords.\nVithal Patil holds the record for most wickets in the Kanga League, with 759 wickets for the Dadar Union Cricket Club between 1952 and 1984. Aditya Tare is the only batsman to have ever scored a double century in a Kanga League match; Tare scored 201 in a 2013 match for Victory Cricket Club against Fort Vijay Cricket Club. In 2014, Neil Narvekar made 100 runs off 29 balls, the fastest century in Kanga League history.\nCompetition format.\n98 teams play in the Kanga League; they are divided into 7 groups of 14 teams.\nPoints System.\nThe points systems for the Kanga League is as follows:"

        "text": "The 1980 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the gentlemen's singles tournament at the 1980 Wimbledon Championships. After 3 hours and 53 minutes of play, the four-time defending champion Björn Borg defeated John McEnroe 1–6, 7–5, 6–3, 6–7(16–18), 8–6 to win the match. McEnroe saved seven championship points during the match but ultimately lost to Borg in what was regarded at the time as the greatest tennis match ever played (it would later be compared to the 2008 men's singles final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal).\nMatch.\nThe match was eagerly awaited as not only was it a clash between the top two seeds, it was also viewed as a meeting of opposites:\nAt the start of the final, McEnroe was booed by the crowd as he entered Centre Court, because of the heated exchanges he had had with officials during his semi-final victory over Jimmy Connors.\nIn the final's fourth-set tiebreaker that lasted 20 minutes, McEnroe saved five championship points and eventually won 18–16. The tie-break was later described by one reporter as \"the most riveting episode in the sport's history\".\nMcEnroe, however, could not break Borg's serve in the fifth set, which the Swede won 8–6.\nSignificance.\nThis match was called the best Wimbledon final by ESPN's countdown show \"Who's Number One?\" and \"one of the three or four greatest sporting events in history\" by ESPN English speaking personality Mike Greenberg. In 1999, it ranked #10 on ESPN's \"SportsCentury's Ten Greatest Games of the 20th Century\". In a 2002 UK poll conducted by Channel 4, the British public voted the match #10 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. The \"New York Times\" tennis writer Neil Amdur wrote in 2011: \"I covered the 1980 Wimbledon men’s singles final between McEnroe and Borg. Until the 2008 Nadal–Federer classic at the All England Club, the Borg–McEnroe five-setter at Wimbledon was the greatest tennis match I had ever seen, but after watching chunks of the 3:53 McEnroe–Borg final at an HBO screening, I am tempted again to reaffirm its place as the sport’s single most compelling piece of court magic\"."

Donaldson played 35 matches, including 13 test matches, for the All Blacks from 1977 to 1981.\nBiography.\nAfter playing in the New Plymouth Boys' High School 1st XV for two years, Donaldson made his provincial debut for Manawatu in 1974 before joining Hawke's Bay in 1975. He returned to Manawatu in 1976.\nDonaldson, nicknamed \"Bullet\", first played at the senior national level with the New Zealand Barbarians, in 1977 in Australia. He was then selected for the All Blacks team during their tour of France in 1977, playing five matches (including two test matches).\nHe continued his success with the All Blacks in 1978 with wins against the teams from Australia, England, and Scotland, but missed the matches against Wales due to injury.\nIn March 1979, Donaldson played in South Africa with a World Invitation XV and then in the All Blacks' series against France, Australia and Scotland. He subsequently lost his regular place in the All Black team to Dave Loveridge who was regarded as a more consistent performer.\nHe rejoined the All Blacks for the 1980 season against Australia, but was side-lined with a broken jaw after two matches. Recovering, he played during the All Black tours of Fiji and Wales. He was an All Black half-back reserve for the 1981 series against Scotland and the South African Springboks. Significantly, his only field time was during the historic 25–22 victory over the Springboks in Auckland when, late in the game, he replaced Loveridge, who was injured. Donaldson was instrumental in setting up the penalty play which resulted in the All Blacks winning the game.\nAs captain, he continued to play for Manawatu in 1982, taking a mid-season break in 1983. He switched to the Te Kawau Club in 1984, but missed most of the year due to injury, returning to competition in 1985, until a new injury caused him to permanently retire from playing.\nBetween 1990 and 1992, Donaldson coached the Manawatu side."

With 9 points in 16 playoff games, his team went on to win the Swedish Championship that year.\nOn 18 May 2011, Larsson signed a three-year contract with the Minnesota Wild, but was loaned to Brynäs for the 2011–12 season.\nWith the intention of pursuing his NHL career, Larsson relocated to North America, and was directly assigned to the Wild's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Houston Aeros, to begin the 2012–13 season due to the lockout. Larsson was recalled to the Wild during the shortened season as an injury replacement and made his NHL debut against the Detroit Red Wings on February 17, 2013.\nOn 3 April 2013 at the trade deadline, Larsson was acquired by the Buffalo Sabres along with goaltender Matt Hackett, a first-round pick in 2013 (Nikita Zadorov) and a second-round pick in 2014 (Brycen Martin) from the Wild in exchange for Jason Pominville and a fourth-round pick in 2014.\nLarsson has on several occasions participated in Sweden's national teams, including the junior teams as well as the senior team. In the 2010 World U18 Championships, Larsson and his Sweden were placed second after the United States, losing the final against them.\nThe Sabres re-signed Larsson in the summer before the 2017–18 season to a two-year, $1.475 million contract. During the 2017–18 season, Larsson was suspended for two games on 2 February 2018 for cross checking Vincent Trocheck in a 4–2 loss to the Florida Panthers.\nOn 12 July 2019, the Sabres re-signed Larsson to a one-year, $1.55 million contract extension. In his eighth year within the Sabres organization in the 2019–20 season, Larsson recorded 6 goals and a career NHL high 18 points in 62 games before the season was paused and effectively ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 10 October 2020, as an unrestricted free agent from the Sabres, Larsson opted to sign a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the Arizona Coyotes.\nOn 21 March 2022, the day of the NHL trade deadline, the Arizona Coyotes traded Larsson to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a third-round pick. Larsson having been injured while traded by the Coyotes later returned to health and played out the remainder of the season with the Capitals, contributing with 6 points in 14 regular season games. He made his NHL playoff debut in the post-season, adding two assists through 6 games.\nOn 12 August 2022, Larsson as a free agent halted his NHL career in opting to return to his original Swedish club, Brynäs IF of the SHL, after signing a three-year, $930,000 contract.\nInternational play.\nOn 30 March 2011, Larsson made his senior national team debut in an exhibition game against Latvia which ended 4–1 in Sweden's favour. In the 2012 World J20 Championships, he was the captain when Sweden won its first J20 gold medal since 1981, its second overall."

        "text": "Michael Malone (born September 15, 1971) is an American professional basketball coach who is the head coach for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He had also been the head coach of the Sacramento Kings in 2013–2014. Malone previously served as an assistant coach of the New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, New Orleans Hornets, and Golden State Warriors.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in the Astoria neighborhood of the New York City borough Queens, Malone is the son of Brendan Malone, a former NBA head coach. Malone began his high school playing career at Bishop Hendricken in Warwick, Rhode Island from 1984-1986 while his father was head coach at the University of Rhode Island. He transferred to Seton Hall Preparatory School after his father joined the New York Knicks coaching staff as an assistant. Following graduation from Seton Hall, Malone attended prep school at Worcester Academy during the 1988–89 school year. He then attended Loyola University Maryland, playing on the Loyola Greyhounds men's basketball team from 1989 to 1993. He appeared in 107 games and started 39 of them as a point guard. He graduated in 1994 with a degree in history. During his four seasons with the Greyhounds, Malone totaled 370 points, 279 assists and 79 steals in 18.5 minutes per game.\nCoaching career.\nCollege (1994–2001).\nWhile completing his degree at Loyola, Malone was an assistant high school basketball coach at Friends School of Baltimore. After graduating from Loyola, Malone joined Oakland University as an assistant coach for Golden Grizzlies men's basketball under coach Greg Kampe. Malone was about to start training to join the Michigan State Police before getting a job offer from Providence College coach Pete Gillen. Malone was an assistant coach for Providence Friars men's basketball from 1995 to 1998. In the 1998–99 season, Malone was director of men's basketball administration at the University of Virginia.\nEarly NBA years (2001–2011).\nHe later moved up to the NBA in 2001 as a coaching associate with the New York Knicks who worked with players, coaching staff, personnel and the video coordinator and edited scouting reports. The Knicks promoted Malone to assistant coach in 2003. Malone later served as an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers from to . With Cleveland, Malone helped coach the Cavaliers to five consecutive playoff appearances, including the 2007 NBA Finals, and a franchise-record, league-best 66–16 season in the . Malone was an assistant coach with the New Orleans Hornets in the . Allowing a league-best 8.7 fewer points per game than the previous season, the Hornets had the most improved defense with Malone as assistant and made the 2011 Playoffs.\nGolden State Warriors (2011–2013).\nThe Golden State Warriors hired Malone in the summer of 2011 as an assistant coach under Mark Jackson. In the , the Warriors improved from a 23–43 record to finish 47–35 and earn the team's first playoff berth since 2007. As the sixth seed in the 2013 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors upset the third-seed Denver Nuggets in the first round and lost to the eventual Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs in six games the next round. Malone was reportedly the highest-paid NBA assistant coach in the . In 2012, Malone was named the best assistant coach by the NBA general managers. After his departure, several Warriors, including Draymond Green and Stephen Curry, credited Malone as being a huge part of the team's success.\nSacramento Kings (2013–2014).\nOn June 3, 2013, Malone was hired by majority owner Vivek Ranadivé as the new head coach of the Sacramento Kings. With the hiring, Malone and his father became the second father-son duo in NBA history, after Bill Musselman and Eric Musselman, to head coach an NBA team. On December 15, 2014, he was fired by the Kings after starting the 2014–15 season with an 11–13 win–loss record.\nDenver Nuggets (2015–present).\nOn June 15, 2015, he was named the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets. In the 2018–19 season, Malone led the Nuggets to the second seed in the Western Conference, behind the Golden State Warriors, with a 54–28 record. In the Nuggets first playoff berth in six seasons, Denver defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the First Round in seven games, before being eliminated in the Semi-finals by the Portland Trail Blazers, also in seven games.\nOn December 24, 2019, the Nuggets announced that they had agreed to a contract extension with Malone. During the 2020 playoffs in the NBA Bubble, the Nuggets would become the first team in league history to overcome multiple 3–1 deficits in a single postseason, defeating the Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Clippers in the First Round and Semi-finals respectively. Despite the historic feat, Denver would be eliminated in the Western Conference finals by the eventual NBA champion, the Los Angeles Lakers, in five games.\nOn March 23, 2022, Malone and the Nuggets reached an agreement on a multi-year contract extension.\nIn the 2022–23 season, outside of a few instances of being tied with the Memphis Grizzlies, the Nuggets would hold sole position of the top seed in the Western Conference from December 20 until the end of the regular season, earning Malone a second All Star Game coaching gig in five years in the process. Despite being the top seed in the West, the seemingly overlooked Denver Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games in the First Round, before needing six games to outlast Devin Booker, newly acquired Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns in the Semi-Finals to advance to their second Conference Finals in four seasons, where, like 2020, they'd again be matched up with LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the Los Angeles Lakers. Denver would go on to sweep the Lakers and advance to their first NBA Finals in franchise history. It was also the first time a Nuggets team had ever swept an opponent in postseason history. \nIn the 2023 NBA Finals, Denver would face off against the Miami Heat, the first eighth seed to reach the Finals since the 1998–99 New York Knicks. Holding a 3–1 series advantage heading into Game 5, the Nuggets, who entered the game with a series shooting average of 37.6% from three-point range, shot a historically poor 6.7% from three-point range in the first half. Additionally, Denver committed 10 turnovers in the first half and missed 10 of their first 19 free throws. Despite their shooting struggles, the Nuggets showed their resiliency, as they stormed back from an early 10-point deficit to take an 83–76 lead with 4:43 left in the fourth quarter\nand would ultimately defeat Miami 94–89 at home to clinch the first championship title in franchise history after a 47-year drought, with Nikola Jokić unanimously being named NBA Finals MVP.\nNational team coaching career.\nIn January 2020, Malone joined the Serbian national team coaching staff as a consultant for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament.\nPersonal life.\nMalone and his wife have two daughters."

It is the only surviving building of the Augustinian Taunton Priory which was founded about 1115, although there is some evidence that its early use was not as a barn but as a guesthouse or quarters for a Priory\nofficial. The local stone rubble has been repaired with red brick and has a tie-beam roof covered with tiles. The door and window openings are made of Bishops Lydeard stone. The exact dates of the building are disputed, but is argued to be from the late 15th or early 16th century, and replacing an earlier 13th or 14th-century building on the site, but incorporating some of the earlier building. It was a Scheduled Ancient Monument until 1999 when it was descheduled. The building was once used as a chapel by Frenchmen, possibly prisoners during the French Revolutionary Wars or Napoleonic Wars.\nHistory.\nThe Old Priory Barn was purchased by the Somerset CCC Supporters Club when it became available in 1979, as the cricket club was unable to afford it at the time. Over the next ten years the building was restored, and in April 1989 the museum was officially opened to the public.\nCollection.\nThe exhibits and displays in the museum primarily cover the cricket club's history, including Test match players such as Ian Botham and Marcus Trescothick. It also has a section devoted to the England women's cricket team, as the County Ground is their headquarters. The museum also hosts a collection of I Zingari memorabilia, a club with which current chairman Charles Clive Ponsonby-Fane has strong family links."

        "text": "This is a record of Italy's results at the FIFA World Cup. Italy is one of the most successful national teams in the history of the World Cup, having won four titles (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006), just one fewer than Brazil. The team was present in 18 out of the 22 tournaments, reaching six finals, a third place and a fourth place.\nOverall record.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third Place   Fourth Place  \nBy match.\n\"Italy's score listed first\"\nWorld Cup Finals.\n1934 World Cup Final v Czechoslovakia.\nWith temperatures around 40 °C (104 °F), Italy won their home tournament in 1934 after going into extra time against Czechoslovakia.\n1938 World Cup Final v Hungary.\nAfter a difficult route to the final, defeating hosts France in the quarter-finals and Brazil in the semis, Italy was the first team to win the World Cup title on foreign ground. Also, it was the first of only two times in World Cup history that a team successfully defended their title.\n1970 World Cup Final v Brazil.\nIn 1970, the Brazilian team featured superstars like Pelé, Rivellino, Jairzinho and Carlos Alberto and were considered favourites for the title. Particularly in the second half, the Italians were outclassed by the Brazilians passing play.\n1982 World Cup Final v West Germany.\nItaly played three draws in the first group stage in a worrisome start to the tournament, proceeding ahead of Cameroon only on number of goals scored. However, the Italians continued to defeat Brazil, Argentina and a strong Polish side over the course of the tournament and faced West Germany in the final in Madrid.\nAntonio Cabrini missed a penalty in the goalless first half, but the dominant Italian side eventually built up a 3–0 lead and won by 3–1 in the end, securing their third World Cup trophy.\n1994 World Cup Final v Brazil.\nThe 1994 final was the first ever to be decided on penalties after goalless 120 minutes. Italian captain Franco Baresi missed the very first penalty, and Roberto Baggio the decisive last one.\nItaly became the first team to lose two World Cup finals against the same opponent.\n2006 World Cup Final v France.\nItalian defender Marco Materazzi was involved in all three outstanding moments of the first 120 minutes: He conceded the penalty that was converted by Zinedine Zidane early in the game, equalised with a powerful header soon after, and provoked Zidane in a manner that lead to the French captain being sent off. He also scored in the penalty-shootout that was to follow.\nIt was only the second time a World Cup final was decided on penalties, again involving Italy after the 1994 final lost to Brazil.\nPlayer records.\nMost appearances.\nPaolo Maldini is the player with the fourth-most matches at FIFA World Cups, trailing only behind the Argentinian Lionel Messi (26) and the Germans Lothar Matthäus (25) and Miroslav Klose (24). This also makes him the player with the most World Cup matches without winning the trophy.\nGoalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is the only Italian player, and one of only three in the world, who have been part of five FIFA World Cup squads.\nTop goalscorers.\nTwo Italians were awarded the Golden Boot for best goalscorer at a FIFA World Cup: Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Salvatore Schillaci in 1990 with 6 goals each.\nAwards and records.\nIndividual awards.\nGolden Ball award\nGolden Boot award\nOther individual awards\nRefereeing.\nThree World Cup finals have been officiated by representatives of the Italian football federation, only English referees have had the honour more often (four times). The 1978 final between Argentina and the Netherlands has been led by Sergio Gonella, who had already officiated the European Championship final two years earlier. The other referees are Pierluigi Collina in 2002, and Nicola Rizzoli in 2014.\nThe Italian referee with the most World Cup matches, however, is Roberto Rosetti, who has been in charge of six matches total in 2006 and 2010."

Ecuador's first participation in the World Cup was in 2002. Their best performance was in 2006, where they were eliminated in the round of 16.\nQualification history.\nFrom 1930 to 1938, Ecuador refrained from FIFA World Cup qualification tournaments.

        "title": "Pittsburgh Panthers women's volleyball",
        "text": "Pittsburgh Panthers women's volleyball is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate volleyball program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as \"Pitt\", located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt volleyball team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and plays their home games in Fitzgerald Field House. Since the founding of the volleyball program in 1974, the Panthers have had a winning season all but four years, have one of the nation's top all-time winning percentages, have appearanced in 22 national championship tournaments, and have won conference championships in 16 different seasons including eleven as a member of the Big East Conference and five since joining the ACC.\nHistory.\nThe beginning.\nPitt women's volleyball was founded in 1974 and was led during its first season by coach Mary Kromer who guided the team, originally nicknamed the Pantherettes, to a 14–3 record in their first year of existence. Perhaps more impressively, in the first year of the program, and despite the fact that two of the starters never played volleyball before, the team was invited to participate in the Eastern Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (EAIAW) regional championship, where the team advanced to the quarterfinals. Kromer continued as coach for the programs second season, in which the team posted an 18–2 record and again appeared in the EAIAW regional championships.\nMike Hebert years.\nPrior to the 1976 season, Mike Hebert, a former player at the UC-Santa Barbara who was teaching at Pitt, was asked by the university to coach the women's team although he'd never seen women play volleyball. He eventually accepted the part-time job to coach the up-start program for $1,500. Without many collegiate women's team sports in existence in the mid-1970s, Hebert and his team were pioneers who \"invented things as [they] went along\". Despite this, Herbert guided the Panthers to a fourth-place finish in the EAIAW championships during his first two seasons. Under his guidance, Pitt broke through to national prominence in 1978 winning the EAIAW Championship and advancing to the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) National Large College Volleyball Championships where they finished with a 2–3 record and a 13th place national finish en route to the program's first 40-win season. His part-time position turning full-time in his final season in 1979, which saw the Panthers successfully defend their EAIAW Championship and earn a return trip to the AIWA national championships. During this span he also collected EAIAW Eastern Region Coach of the Year awards at Pitt in 1978 and 1979. Herbert, who also served as an assistant coach for Pitt's men's team for the last two years of his stay in Pittsburgh, then left, citing family reasons, to take the head coaching job at the New Mexico, eventually coaching at Illinois and Minnesota; along the way winning multiple national championships, the national coach of the year award, and earning induction into the American Volleyball Coaches Association Hall of Fame.\nShelton Collier years.\nThe program next turned to Ohio State assistant Shelton Collier, who in his initial season as head coach in 1980 guided the Panthers to a school record with 41 wins, and followed up in 1981 with a season that included a win at eighth-ranked Pepperdine, an EAIWA Championship, and a ninth-place finish in the final year of the AIAW national championships. In 1982, the women's volleyball program transitioned both into the NCAA, which took over the sponsorship of intercollegiate athletics from the AIWA, as well as into the Big East Conference. In addition, the program permanently moved their home games from their primary home in Trees Hall to the larger Fitzgerald Field House, which had previously hosted select volleyball tournaments and games. During Collier's tenure, Pitt established itself as the dominant volleyball team in the Big East from the start, winning the regular season Big East Southern Division tournament, without losing a game and losing only one set, in every year in which it competed: 1982, 1983, and 1984. Pitt also won the first ever Big East Tournament in 1982 without losing a game en route to the program's second 41-win season. Collier guided Pitt to capture additional Big East Tournament crowns in 1984, 1986, and 1988 and appeared in the NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987.\nSue Woodstra years.\nSue Woodstra, a silver medalist for the U.S. National Volleyball Team at the 1984 Summer Olympics, took over the Pitt program in 1989. During her tenure, she led her teams to Big East Conference tournament championships in each season as well as three Big East regular season championships, winning the regular season each year from when the Big East instituted round-robin play in 1990. She also led the Panthers to four post-season appearances including one Women's Invitation Volleyball Championship appearance in 1989 in which Pitt finished third, and three NCAA volleyball tournaments, including in 1990 where Pitt reached the regional semifinal and finished ranked 18th in the final American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) Coaches poll. Woodstra's teams NCAA tournament teams were led by standout second team All-American outside hitter Ann Marie Lucanie, who won the Big East Tournament MVP award four straight years as well as a record three straight Big East Player of the Year awards, including in her senior year in 1993 under new head coach Cindy Alvear. In total, Woodstra compiled an overall record of 110–39 (.738) over four seasons as head coach.\nAlvear and Beerman years.\nCindy Alvear took over in 1993 leading Pitt to Big East regular season championships, Big East Tournament championships, and NCAA Tournament appearances in her first two seasons. This was followed by second-place finishes in both the Big East regular season and tournaments in 1995 and 1996 with a National Invitational Volleyball tournament appearance in 1995. Pitt program slipped in the late 1990s, experiencing its first losing Big East record in 1999. Chris Beerman took over the program in 2000 and helped lead the team back to a winning conference record. A losing record in 2001, Pitt's first ever, snapped one of the longest NCAA records for consecutive winning seasons. However, the Panthers rebounded in a big way in 2003 by winning the Big East regular season and tournament championship and advancing into the second round of the NCAA tournament. A second-place finish Big East finish and at-large bid to the NCAA tournament followed in 2004, before the program experienced only its third losing season in 2007.\nToby Rens years.\nToby Rens was hired to take over the program in 2008, immediately restoring the program to a winning season and his first year. In 2009, despite being picked to finish eighth in the Big East, Rens guided the Panthers to a school record twelve Big East wins and a second-place finish behind Big East Player of the Year and third team All-American middle hitter Meagan Dooley. Heading into the 2010 season, the Panthers faced ten 2009 NCAA Tournament participants, but faltered to 13–18 record and a loss in the first round of the Big East Tournament. This was followed by an 18–15 record and a 17–14 record in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Following the 2012 season, Rens accepted the head coaching job at Chicago State University.\nDan Fisher era.\nDan Fisher arrived as head coach the same year that Pitt entered the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2013. Fisher, who led Concordia University-Irvine to the 2012 NAIA national championship with an overall two-year record of 72–2. led Pitt to a fifth-place finish in its first year in the ACC, exceeding pre-season expectations that had Pitt picked to finish 13th in the conference. Pitt improved to 25–6 in Fisher's second year at Pitt. He led the Panthers back to the NCAA tournament in 2016 and 2017, as well as to the program's first ACC conference championship in 2017, for which he received ACC and AVCA East Coast Region Coach of the Year honors. In 2018, he led Pitt to its first top five AVCA coaches poll ranking in program history and its second straight ACC Championship and earned his second straight ACC Coach of the Year honors. In 2019, the program reached the highest national ranking ever achieved by an ACC team when it was voted #2 in the AVCA coaches poll, won its third straight ACC conference championship with an 18-0 conference record, and received a program best sixth seed in the NCAA tournament. In the 2020 season, the NCAA postponed the volleyball tournament to April due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a result, the ACC scheduled was altered to eight fall matches and the remainder in the spring. After a 4–4 record in the fall schedule, the Panthers won twelve straight matches to finish the regular season 16–4. In the NCAA tournament, the Panthers would make program history by advancing past the second round for the first time after a sweep of #14 overall seed Utah. In the following round, Pitt upset #3 overall seed Minnesota in five sets to advance to its first Regional Final in school history. Pitt finished the season ranked #8 on the final AVCA Coaches’ Poll, their highest final ranking in program history.\nIn the 2021 season, the Panthers came back from their tournament run by starting the season 15–0, and finishing 26–3. Their regular season included big wins over then No. 23 Rice, No. 18 Washington State, No.9 Baylor, No. 12 BYU, and No. 13 Georgia Tech. For their quality RPI, they Panthers earned the #3 seed in the NCAA tournament, their best in program history. In the second round of the tournament, the Panthers defeated rival Penn State for the first time in postseason history in a tight 3–1 win at the Petersen Events Center. Upon advancing, the Panthers earned the right to host their first Regional, and held their first ever tournament matches at Fitzgerald Field House. In the Round of 16, the Panthers easily swept Kansas before meeting #6 Purdue in the Regional Final. After Purdue won a lengthy second set, 30–28, the Panthers powered from there winning the next two sets on its home floor to earn its first National semifinal appearance in program history.\nTeam awards and accomplishments.\nPostseason national tournaments.\nSince the founding of its volleyball program in 1974, Pitt has participated in post-season volleyball tournaments in 25 different seasons. Post-season play include 16 NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship tournament appearances, 3 AIAW National Championship appearances, 8 EAIAW Regional championship appearances, and two NIVC tournament appearances.\nAIWA.\nPrior to the NCAA taking on the administration of women's sports and championships in 1981, the AIWA and its regional affiliates conducted regional and national championships in volleyball. In 1981, schools could compete in either the AIWA and NCAA and both organizations held championships, but by 1982, only the NCAA remained.\nRegionals.\nEAIWA Regional Championship appearances (8)\nNationals.\nAIWA national championship appearances (3)\nNCAA.\nPitt has participated in 19 NCAA Women's Volleyball Championships and has an overall record of 22–18 in the tournament.\nNIVC.\nThe National Invitational Volleyball Championship (NIVC) was founded in 1989 as the Women's Invitational Volleyball Championship (WIVC). The post-season tournament existed for seven seasons from 1989 to 1995. Pitt participated in the post-season tournament in two seasons, finishing in third place in 1989.\nBig East Championships.\nWhile a member of the Big East Conference between 1982 and 2012, Pitt won more Big East tournament championships (11) than any other school, winning seven straight from 1988 to 1994. Additionally, Pitt has been the Big East tournament runner-up five times. The Big East Conference began holding conference tournaments to crown a champion in 1982, but did not conduct round-robin play and crown a regular season champion until 1990. Prior to 1990, the Big East schools were organized into divisions and sometimes held regular-season divisional tournaments.\nBig East Championship Tournament.\nBig East tournament champions (11)\nBig East Tournament Runner-up (5)\nBig East regular season.\nThe Big East did not begin sponsoring regular season conference play and regular season standings until 1990.

It is affiliated to the International Baseball Federation and his continental confederation COPABE. It is controlled by the Federación de Béisbol y Softbol de Chile.\nHistory of Baseball in Chile.\nEarly Beginnings.\nThe sport of baseball was introduced to Chile on July 4, 1918. At that time, the city of Iquique in northern Chile was experiencing a nitrate boom. Sakurada Tatsukichi Endo, a Japanese man who went by the name \"John,\" arrived in Iquique aboard a ship named Maru. John was an enthusiast of baseball, which was already a popular sport in the United States, Europe, and his native Japan. In 1931, John, along with eight other local players, established the Iquique Baseball Association, becoming Chile's first governing body for the sport.\nInitial Development.\nEarly baseball practices in Iquique took place on makeshift fields, using subpar equipment provided by Sakurada. Despite these humble beginnings, baseball soon started to spread to other cities in northern Chile, including Tocopilla, Antofagasta, and Chuquicamata.\nExpansion and Clubs.\nBy 1949, the sport had reached Santiago, where the first baseball clubs were established. The clubs comprised a diverse group of players, including Chileans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. In that same year, the first inter-city match in Chilean baseball history took place in the north. In 1951, the Baseball Federation of Chile was founded, and by 1953, an annual national championship had been established.\nSuccesses and Challenges.\nThe 1980s were a golden era for baseball in Chile, particularly due to the disillusionment with the national football team's performance in the 1982 World Cup in Spain. Chilean baseball reached a high point when it participated in the Baseball World Youth Cup in Japan in 1989. However, the victory of the football team Colo-Colo in the 1991 Copa Libertadores led to a resurgence of football's popularity, which resulted in a decline for baseball, as well as other sports like basketball and boxing.\nModern Era.\nBetween 1998 and 2004, baseball faced a severe decline, verging on extinction from the professional sports scene in Chile. This period also saw declines in basketball and volleyball. The sport's federation has cited the overwhelming popularity of football and tennis as major challenges, as they have nearly monopolized the sports landscape in Chile.\nKits.\nCatchers\nInfielders\nOutfielders"

This notes the fact that some players inevitably start off the season on fire, but then tail off in production, while other players start off slowly and become \"Mr. October\"s.

        "text": "The men's sprint cycling event at the 1932 Summer Olympics took place on August 1 and 3. The format was a sprint of 1000 metres. There were nine competitors from nine nations, with each nation limited to one cyclist. The event was won by Jacobus van Egmond of the Netherlands, the nation's second victory in the men's sprint. It was the fourth consecutive Games that the Netherlands reached the podium in the event. France made the podium for the third consecutive Games, with Louis Chaillot taking silver. Bruno Pellizzari gave Italy its first men's sprint medal with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. None of the semifinalists from 1928 returned. The small field included only one rider who had medaled at a World Championship: Bruno Pellizzari of Italy, who finished third in 1930.\nMexico made its debut in the men's sprint. France made its seventh appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis track cycling event consisted of numerous rounds. Each race involved the riders starting simultaneously and next to each other, from a standing start. Because the early part of races tend to be slow-paced and highly tactical, only the time for the last 200 metres of the one-kilometre race is recorded.\nThe competition involved four main rounds and a repechage. In the first round, there were three heats of three cyclists each. The top two in each heat advanced directly to the quarterfinals. The third-placed rider in each heat went to a repechage. The repechage was a single heat of three cyclists; the top two advanced to the quarterfinals while the third-place rider was eliminated. Starting in the quarterfinals, each race was one-on-one: the eight quarterfinalists competed in four quarterfinals, with the winner advancing to the semifinals and the loser eliminated. Similarly, the four semifinalists competed in two semifinals. The winners advanced to the final while the losers competed against each other in a bronze medal match.\nThe 1932 competition introduced the best-of-three format for the final (and only the final). The two finalists competed up to three times, with the first cyclist to win two races being the winner.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new Olympic record was set during the competition.\nResults.\nRiders competed in three heats and one repechage; top two riders advanced to quarterfinal.\nQuarterfinals.\nWinner of each of the four heats advanced to the semifinal round.\nQuarterfinal 4.\nPellizzari pushed Chambers out to the edge of the track, resulting in a protest by the British side. The protest was denied and Pellizzari advanced.\nSemifinal.\nWinner of each of the two heats advanced to the final round.\nSemifinal 1.\nChaillot beat Gray by inches.\nSemifinal 2.\nPellizzari had inside position for the last lap and a half, but van Egmond was able to beat him easily.\nFinals.\nBronze medal match.\nGray declined to compete in the bronze medal race, deciding to saving himself for the time trial later in the day (which he won).\nFinal.\nChaillot won the first race in a very close finish, with some observers believing van Egmond had won. However, the Dutch team did not protest. Van Egmond won by a bike length in the second race to set up a decisive third race. Van Egmond led the entire third race and was able to hold off Chaillot's attack to win by a wheel."

The tournament has been contested every four years since 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to the Second World War. \nThe Wales national football team have entered every World Cup since 1950, but to date have only qualified for two finals tournaments: in 1958 and 2022. In 1958, they reached the quarter-finals before being eliminated by eventual winners Brazil. In 2022, they finished bottom of Group B behind England, the United States and Iran.\nHistory.\nBefore 1950.\nDuring the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Wales, England, Ireland and Scotland held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA. As a result, Wales did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Football Association of Wales did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.\nBrazil 1950.\nThe 1949–50 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats in their first two matches against England (4–1 at home) and Scotland (2–0 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\nSwitzerland 1954.\nAs in 1950, the 1953–54 British Home Championship was used to determine which British nations would qualify for the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland. In their three matches, Wales managed just one point, with a 3–3 draw in Scotland sandwiched between home defeats to England (4–1) and Northern Ireland (2–1), leaving them bottom of the table. Wales' five goals in qualifying were scored by just two players: John Charles (3) and Ivor Allchurch (2).\nSweden 1958.\nThe qualification process for the 1958 FIFA World Cup saw FIFA split up the Home Nations for the first time, with Wales drawn into Group 4 with Czechoslovakia and East Germany. Their qualifying campaign started off well, with a goal from Roy Vernon proving the difference in a 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia in Cardiff, but a 2–1 loss to East Germany in Leipzig and a 2–0 defeat to Czechoslovakia left Wales bottom of the group going into the final match at home to East Germany on 25 September 1957. Goals from Des Palmer and Cliff Jones gave Wales a 3–0 lead going into half-time; Manfred Kaiser pulled one back for the East Germans, but it proved to be too great a margin to overcome, and Palmer completed his hat-trick to give Wales a 4–1 win and put them level on points with Czechoslovakia at the top of the group. A win for East Germany over Czechoslovakia by the right scoreline the following month would see Wales qualify as group winners for their first World Cup. In the end, Czechoslovakia beat East Germany by the same scoreline as Wales had (4–1), consigning Wales to second place in the group and ending their World Cup qualifying journey.\nHowever, elsewhere in qualifying, Israel had reached the final round of qualifying without playing a single match as a result of their opponents pulling out for various political reasons. FIFA ruled that no team other than the hosts and holders could qualify without playing any matches, so they ordered a qualification play-off against one of the second-placed European teams. Belgium were drawn first, but refused to participate; Wales were the next team drawn, and so a two-legged play-off was scheduled for early 1958. Wales won each leg 2–0, giving them a 4–0 aggregate win. Wales' manager at the time was Manchester United assistant manager Jimmy Murphy; the second leg of the Israel play-off was scheduled for the same day as Manchester United's European Cup quarter-final against Red Star Belgrade, which Murphy missed to lead his country, a decision that might have saved his life – the Manchester United plane crashed in Munich on the return journey from Belgrade in an incident that killed 23 people, including eight Manchester United players and three members of the club's staff.\nAt the finals tournament, Wales were drawn in Group 3 along with 1954 finalists Hungary, Mexico and hosts Sweden. Wales began with a 1–1 draw with Hungary, John Charles scoring a 27th-minute equaliser after József Bozsik had given the Magyars the lead in the fifth minute. Ivor Allchurch then gave Wales the lead after half an hour of their second game against Mexico, only for Jaime Belmonte to equalise with a minute left to play. That result left Wales in second place in the group after two matches, but their final match was against leaders Sweden. The two final matches were not played simultaneously, with Wales and Sweden kicking off five hours earlier than Hungary and Mexico, which allowed Wales to stake an early claim to a place in the quarter-finals; they held the hosts to a 0–0 draw, the first time Sweden had been shut out at home in almost a year. Because of the tie-breaking criteria in use at the tournament, that result meant that, regardless of the margin of victory, the best Hungary and Mexico could manage would be to force a play-off against Wales for a place in the quarter-finals – a draw would see them both eliminated. Hungary won the match 4–0, and the play-off was scheduled for two days later in Solna.\nHungary took the lead through Lajos Tichy after 33 minutes and held the lead until half-time. Ten minutes after the break, Ivor Allchurch scored the equaliser, before Terry Medwin scored the winner with just under a quarter of an hour left to play. The result meant Wales qualified for the quarter-finals, where they would play against the winners of Group 4, Brazil. Having impressed in Brazil's last group match against the Soviet Union, a 17-year-old Pelé again started against Wales; however, it took almost three-quarters of the match for Brazil to break through the Welsh defence, as Pelé's flick took him past Mel Charles and he toe-poked home the only goal of the game. Pelé went on to score a further five goals in the tournament, including a hat-trick in the 5–2 win over France in the semi-finals, and two more in another 5–2 win over Sweden in the final as Brazil won the tournament for the first time.\nGroup 3\nPlay-off\nQuarter-finals\nChile 1962.\nIn qualifying for the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, Wales were drawn into Group 9 with Austria, Denmark and Spain. The group was split into two rounds, with Wales and Austria – as the two nations that had qualified for the 1958 World Cup – receiving a bye to the second round. Denmark withdrew from the qualifying process before any matches were played, so Spain advanced automatically. Austria then also withdrew, leaving Wales and Spain to play off over two legs to determine who would advance. The first leg in Cardiff on 19 April 1961 saw Wales take an early lead through Phil Woosnam after seven minutes, only for Alfonso Rodríguez Salas to level the scores midway through the first half, before Alfredo Di Stéfano scored the winner for Spain with 12 minutes left. The return leg was played in Madrid a month later with Wales needing to win by a two-goal margin to surpass Spain. After a goalless first half, Joaquín Peiró opened the scoring in the 55th minute; Ivor Allchurch scored one of the three goals Wales now required, but they were unable to find the other two and were eliminated.\nEngland 1966.\nThe 1966 FIFA World Cup was played in England and featured 16 teams. Qualifying saw 32 nations compete for the nine UEFA spots at the finals, in addition to host nation England. Wales were drawn into Group 7 with the Soviet Union, Greece and, for the second time in a row, Denmark. This time, Denmark did not withdraw and beat Wales in the group's opening match in Copenhagen in October 1964, thanks to Ole Madsen scoring the only goal of the game. Mimis Papaioannou and Andreas Papaemmanouil gave Greece a 2–0 win in Wales' next game in December. Papaioannou was on the scoresheet again in the two sides' meeting in Cardiff in March 1965, but it proved to be mere consolation as a brace from Ivor Allchurch and further goals from Mike England and Roy Vernon gave Wales a 4–1 win; however, defeat to the Soviet Union in Moscow in May, thanks to a goal from Valentin Ivanov and an own goal by Graham Williams, meant Wales' hopes of qualification were now out of their hands. The Soviet Union won their next three games, scoring 13 goals in the process and ending Wales' campaign, but the return fixture between the two sides in October 1965 saw Wales come out on top in Cardiff; Anatoliy Banishevskiy opened the scoring for the Soviet Union, but Vernon equalised three minutes later, before Ivor Allchurch scored the winner with 13 minutes to go. Wales played their final qualifier at home to Denmark in Wrexham in December 1965, and a 4–2 win thanks to goals from Wyn Davies, Roy Vernon (2) and Ronnie Rees, meant they finished second in the group, four points behind the Soviet Union.\nMexico 1970.\nThe 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico featured 16 teams, of which nine were UEFA nations; eight who went through qualifying plus holders England. The 29 European teams that entered were divided into eight groups (five of four teams, three of three), with the winners of each group qualifying for the finals. Wales were drawn into Group 3 with Italy and East Germany, but lost all four of their matches and finished bottom of the group, their worst performance in qualifying for a major tournament to date.\nWest Germany 1974.\nThe 1974 FIFA World Cup also featured 16 teams in the finals, with the UEFA qualification process offering eight guaranteed places (in addition to host nation West Germany), plus a further spot for the winners of an inter-continental play-off against a team from South America. The 32 UEFA nations were divided into nine groups (five of four teams, four of three), with the winners of groups 1–8 qualifying automatically for the finals and the winners of group 9 advancing to the play-off. Wales were drawn into Group 5 along with England and Poland. They managed just one point in their first two matches against England (a 1–0 defeat at home and a 1–1 draw away), but goals from Leighton James and Trevor Hockey gave Wales a 2–0 win at home to Poland in their third match. Poland's 2–0 win over England meant that victory for Wales away to Poland would put them top of the group with only England's home meeting with Poland left to play; however, Poland won the match 3–0, which meant Wales finished their qualifying campaign bottom of the group after Poland and England played out a 1–1 draw on the final day.\nArgentina 1978.\nThe 1978 FIFA World Cup followed the same format as four years earlier, with eight of the 16 finals places guaranteed for UEFA teams, plus one more for the winner of an inter-continental play-off, in addition to the World Cup holders West Germany. The 31 UEFA entrants were again divided into nine groups (four of four teams and five of three), and Wales were drawn into Group 7 with Czechoslovakia and Scotland. Despite a 1–0 away loss to Scotland in their opening game in November 1976, Wales managed a 3–0 win at home to Czechoslovakia in March 1977, with goals from Leighton James (2) and Nick Deacy rekindling their hopes of qualification. A win for Wales in their next game at home to Scotland in October 1977 would have put them on the verge of qualification with only Czechoslovakia left to play. The game was originally scheduled for Cardiff's Ninian Park, but new legislation meant the local council would only provide a safety certificate for a maximum attendance of 14,050, despite the FAW's offer to fund improvements to the ground if the council would increase the limit to 25,000. That offer was rejected and similar issues prevented the game from being played at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham, so the FAW selected Anfield in Liverpool to host the match; however, despite its proximity to Wales, the move also made the game more accessible for Scotland fans, who travelled down in their thousands.\nWith the game at 0–0 with just under a quarter of an hour left to play, Joe Jordan and David Jones challenged for a long throw-in from Asa Hartford in the Wales penalty area. Both players' hands went up and the ball struck one of them, resulting in referee Robert Wurtz awarding Scotland a penalty, despite the protests of Wales goalkeeper Dai Davies; replays showed the ball had in fact struck Jordan's hand rather than Jones's, discernible by the fact that Jordan was wearing a long-sleeved blue shirt and Jones was wearing short sleeves. Nevertheless, the decision had been made and Don Masson stepped up to take the penalty; he sent Davies the wrong way to make the score 1–0. A second goal from Kenny Dalglish gave Scotland a 2–0 win, sending them to the World Cup. Wales could now only finish as runners-up with a win away to Czechoslovakia a month later. That match, though, also finished in defeat, Zdeněk Nehoda scoring the only goal for the hosts.\nSpain 1982.\nThe 1982 FIFA World Cup was the first to feature 24 teams at the finals, of which 13 would qualify from UEFA, in addition to host nation Spain. The 33 participating teams were split into five pots and drawn into seven groups (six of five teams, one of three), with the top two from each of the five-team groups and the winner of the three-team group qualifying for the finals. Wales were seeded in Pot C and drawn into Group 3 along with Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Turkey and Iceland. Wales opened their qualifying campaign with consecutive 4–0 wins (away to Iceland and at home to Turkey), followed by two more 1–0 wins (at home to Czechoslovakia and away to Turkey), before dropping their first points in a goalless draw at home to the Soviet Union in May 1981. They followed this up with a 2–0 loss away to Czechoslovakia, though a victory in their next game at home to Iceland, who had held Czechoslovakia to a 1–1 draw in Reykjavík, would have put Wales on the verge of qualification, with Czechoslovakia yet to play either of their matches against the Soviet Union. Robbie James put Wales 1–0 up 25 minutes into the game against Iceland, but Ásgeir Sigurvinsson equalised just after half-time; Alan Curtis then restored Wales' lead seven minutes later, only for Ásgeir to level the scores again just after the hour mark. The match finished 2–2, which meant Wales, expecting to lose to the Soviet Union, would need results to go their way in the matches between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia in order to qualify. The Soviet Union beat Czechoslovakia and then Wales in Tbilisi, and another win over Czechoslovakia in Bratislava would send Wales to the World Cup. Oleg Blokhin opened the scoring for the Soviet Union with less than 15 minutes played, only for Rostislav Vojáček to equalise 20 minutes later; it proved to be the last goal of the game, and the draw was enough for Czechoslovakia to overtake Wales in the group and qualify for the finals.\nMexico 1986.\nFor the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, the 32 participating UEFA nations (excluding holders Italy) were drawn into seven qualifying groups (four of five teams, three of four), with the winners of all seven groups and the runners-up from the five-team groups qualifying directly for the World Cup; the runners-up from Groups 1 and 5 would then contest a play-off for a 12th spot, and the runners-up from Group 7 would play against the winners of the OFC qualifying process for the last place at the World Cup. Wales was seeded in Pot C and drawn into Group 7 along with Spain, Scotland and, for the second time in a row, Iceland. Wales' qualifying campaign got off to a bad start, suffering consecutive away defeats to Iceland (1–0) and Spain (3–0), but they recovered with a 2–1 home win over Iceland, then a 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park, followed by a surprise 3–0 win at home to Spain that featured two goals from Ian Rush and a memorable goal by Mark Hughes. That left Wales needing a win at home to Scotland in September 1985 to secure qualification; any other result would see them eliminated unless Spain failed to better Wales' result in their match against Iceland two weeks later. Hughes opened the scoring for Wales, but a penalty for Scotland, scored by Davie Cooper, gave them a 1–1 draw. Spain's 2–1 victory over Iceland meant they overtook both Wales and Scotland to qualify for the World Cup; Scotland and Wales finished level on points, but with Scotland having the advantage on goal difference.\nItaly 1990.\nThe 1990 FIFA World Cup saw 32 UEFA nations (excluding host nation Italy) compete in qualifying for 13 places at the finals. The teams were placed in five seeding pots before being drawn into seven groups (four of five teams, three of four). The winners of each group plus the runners-up from the five-team groups and the two best runners-up from the four-team groups would qualify for the finals. Wales were seeded in pot C and drawn into Group 4 with West Germany, the Netherlands and Finland. Wales managed just two points in qualifying; after a 1–0 defeat away to the Netherlands in their opening game, they drew 2–2 with Finland and then 0–0 with West Germany, both at home. They then lost all three of the return matches, going down 1–0 away to Finland, 2–1 at home to the Netherlands and 2–1 away to West Germany on the final day. That loss to Finland meant Wales finished bottom of the group.\nUnited States 1994.\nA record 37 teams from the UEFA zone participated in qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Divided into six seeding pots, the teams were then drawn into six groups (five of six teams, one of seven), although the FR Yugoslavia team was suspended following the draw due to the Yugoslav Wars, leaving Group 5 with only five teams. The top two teams from each group would qualify for the finals, joining holders Germany. Wales were seeded in Pot 4 and drawn into Group 4 along with Belgium, Czechoslovakia (known as the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks or RCS following the breakup of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992), Romania, Cyprus and the Faroe Islands. Despite losing 5–1 in their opening game away to Romania, Wales bounced back with consecutive wins at home to the Faroe Islands (6–0) and away to Cyprus (1–0), before another defeat away to Belgium (2–0). That scoreline was reversed in the two's next meeting, sparking a run of five straight matches unbeaten, including wins away to the Faroe Islands (3–0) and at home to Cyprus (2–0), and draws home and away against the RCS. That meant Wales were still in contention going into their final match at home to Romania, though they needed to win and hope the RCS did not beat Belgium in the other game in Brussels. Romania took the lead just after the half-hour mark, but Dean Saunders equalised for Wales on the hour. Two minutes later, Gary Speed was fouled by Dan Petrescu in the Romania penalty area, and referee Kurt Röthlisberger pointed to the spot. Left-back Paul Bodin stepped up to take the kick having scored each of his last three penalties for Wales; however, his powerful kick hit the crossbar and stayed out. With seven minutes to go, Florin Raducioiu scored the winning goal for Romania. With Belgium and the RCS playing out a goalless draw in Brussels, had Bodin's penalty gone in and Wales hung on, they would have qualified for the World Cup; instead, they finished fourth in the group, three points behind qualifiers Romania and Belgium.\nFrance 1998.\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first to feature 32 teams in the finals, but following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, another record of 49 UEFA nations (excluding host nation France) entered qualifying, playing for 14 places in the finals. The teams were seeded into five pots and drawn into nine groups (four of six teams and five of five); the winners of each group and the best runner-up would qualify automatically, with the remaining eight runners-up going into a play-off for the final four spots. Wales were seeded in Pot 4 and drawn into Group 7 with the Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey and San Marino. Wales managed just two wins in qualifying, both against San Marino in their first two matches, winning 5–0 away and 6–0 at home; however, this was followed by back-to-back defeats to the Netherlands (3–1 at home and 7–1 away), before their only other point of the campaign: a goalless draw at home to Turkey. In their last three games, Wales lost 2–1 at home to Belgium, 6–4 away to Turkey and 3–2 away to Belgium, leaving them in fourth place out of the five teams.\nSouth Korea/Japan 2002.\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup featured two host nations for the first time in the tournament's history, with South Korea and Japan welcoming the 30 other nations who reached the finals. In addition to defending champions France, UEFA was allocated 13 guaranteed spots at the tournament, with another potentially going to the winner of a play-off against a team from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The 50 UEFA nations were again seeded into five pots and drawn into nine groups (five of six teams and four of five); the group winners would qualify automatically and eight of the runners-up would go into the UEFA play-offs, while the runner-up from a group drawn randomly before the main draw (Group 2) would go into the AFC play-off. Wales were again seeded in Pot 4 and drawn into Group 5 along with Norway, Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and Armenia. After an opening 2–1 defeat away to Belarus, Wales then recorded six draws in their next seven matches, the other result being a 2–1 defeat at home to Poland. They then lost their penultimate match 3–2 away to Norway, leaving them one last chance to avoid a second winless World Cup qualifying campaign since 1970. In their final fixture, Wales beat Belarus 1–0 at the Millennium Stadium, ending a run of 13 matches without a win and preventing Belarus from reaching the play-offs.\nGermany 2006.\nQualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup saw 51 UEFA nations compete for 13 places at the finals, in addition to host nation Germany. The teams were seeded into seven pots and drawn into eight groups (three of seven teams, five of six), with the winners of each group and the two best runners-up qualifying automatically for the tournament, and the remaining runners-up contesting a play-off for the last three spots. Wales were seeded in Pot D and drawn into Group 6 along with England, Poland, Austria, Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan. Wales began their qualifying campaign with consecutive draws away to Azerbaijan (1–1) and at home to Northern Ireland (2–2), before losing their next six matches in a row. First was a 2–0 defeat away to England in the sides' first meeting in 20 years, followed by a 3–2 home loss to Poland in Mark Hughes' last game as manager and Gary Speed's last as captain. Wales opened 2005 with home and away defeats to Austria (2–0 at home and 1–0 away), before losing the return games against England (1–0 at home) and Poland (1–0 away). They then picked up their first victory of the campaign, winning 3–2 away to Northern Ireland; after taking a 2–0 lead in the first half, Northern Ireland pulled it back to 2–2 within five minutes after the interval, before Ryan Giggs scored the winner with less than 10 minutes to play. Giggs was on the scoresheet again in the final game, scoring both goals as Wales beat Azerbaijan 2–0 at home to confirm fifth place in the group.\nSouth Africa 2010.\nThe 2010 FIFA World Cup followed the same format as the last three, with 32 teams at the finals, 13 of which came through UEFA's qualifying process. The 53 participating teams were seeded into six pots and drawn into nine groups (eight of six teams and one of five), with the winners of each group qualifying automatically and the eight best runners-up contesting a play-off for the four remaining places. Wales were seeded in Pot 4 and drawn into Group 4 along with Germany, Russia, Finland, Liechtenstein and Azerbaijan. After playing them in their most recent World Cup qualifier almost three years earlier, Wales won their first match of this campaign 1–0 at home to Azerbaijan. They alternated between victory and defeat in their first four games, losing their next game 2–1 away to Russia, before a 2–0 home win over Liechtenstein and then a 1–0 defeat away to Germany in their last competitive game of 2008. They started 2009 with another two defeats, at home to Finland and Germany in March and April, before their third straight win over Azerbaijan in June. A 3–1 loss at home to Russia ended Wales' already slim hopes of qualification, while defeat to Finland a month later meant Wales could finish the group no higher than fourth. That position was confirmed with a 2–0 away win over Liechtenstein on the final matchday.\nBrazil 2014.\nThe qualifying process for the 2014 FIFA World Cup again saw 53 UEFA nations compete for 13 places at the finals in Brazil. The teams were seeded into six pots and drawn into nine groups (eight of six teams, one of five), with the winners of each group qualifying automatically and the eight best runners-up going into a play-off for the last four spots. Wales and the Faroe Islands were equal in the FIFA World Ranking used to seed the teams, but the Faroe Islands were successful in their appeal to increase the decimal accuracy of the rankings, which saw them overtake Wales and escape the bottom seeding pot at Wales' expense. Wales were drawn into Group A along with Croatia, Serbia, Belgium, Scotland and Macedonia. They suffered back-to-back defeats in their first two games at home to Belgium (2–0) and away to Serbia (6–1), before coming from behind with two late goals from Gareth Bale to beat Scotland 2–1 in October 2012. Wales finished the year with a defeat to Croatia, before claiming their second win over Scotland in their first competitive game of 2013. A second loss to Croatia came four days later, followed by a 2–1 away defeat to Macedonia and a 3–0 home loss to Serbia that saw them drop to the bottom of the group. Wales moved ahead of Macedonia and Scotland with a 1–0 win over the former in October 2013, only to slip back to fifth place behind the latter following a 1–1 draw with already-qualified Belgium in their final game.\nRussia 2018.\nWales' successful qualification for UEFA Euro 2016 and subsequent rise up the FIFA World Ranking saw them seeded in the first of six pots in qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, along with Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, England, Spain and Croatia. The 52 nations were drawn into nine groups (seven of six teams, two of five), though with the later addition of Gibraltar and Kosovo, every group ended up with six teams each. The winners of each group would qualify for the finals, while the eight best runners-up would go into a play-off for the four remaining UEFA spots. Wales were drawn into Group D with Austria, Serbia, the Republic of Ireland, Moldova and Georgia. Wales' qualification campaign began well, with a 4–0 home win over Moldova; however, five consecutive draws, four of which came after Wales held a lead, left them in third place behind Serbia and Ireland. Three straight wins then followed – at home to Austria (1–0), and away to Moldova (2–0) and Georgia (1–0) – putting Wales in second place, a point behind Serbia with a game to play. A draw against Ireland would guarantee Wales at least a play-off spot, and potentially automatic qualification if Serbia lost to Georgia by at least two goals, while a win would leave Serbia also requiring victory to claim top spot. Serbia ultimately won their match to leave Wales and Ireland battling for the play-off spot, which Ireland claimed thanks to a single goal from James McClean.\nQatar 2022.\nIn qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Wales were drawn in UEFA Group E along with Belgium, the Czech Republic, Belarus and Estonia. After losing 3–1 away to Belgium in their opening game in March 2021, Wales went unbeaten in their remaining seven matches to finish second in the group ahead of the Czech Republic and qualify for the play-offs as one of the six seeds. Drawn in a play-off path against Austria and then the winners of the semi-final between Scotland and Ukraine, Wales beat Austria 2–1 in March 2022, but were made to wait until June for the final, after the match between Scotland and Ukraine was postponed due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine beat Scotland 3–1 at Hampden Park to qualify for the final in Cardiff, where a Gareth Bale free kick was diverted into his own net by Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko to give Wales a 1–0 win and send them to the World Cup for the first time in 64 years.\nThe draw for the finals took place before Wales' play-off path was concluded, which meant despite Wales being ranked 18th in the FIFA World Ranking at the time, which should have put them in Pot 3, they were placed in the bottom of the four pots for the draw. Wales were drawn into Group B along with England (with whom they had shared a group at UEFA Euro 2016), Iran and the United States. Wales announced their 26-man squad for the tournament on 9 November 2022. Wales drew their first fixture against the United States on 21 November 2022; after Timothy Weah opened the scoring for the United States, Wales captain Gareth Bale won a penalty that he converted himself in the 82nd minute. Against Iran four days later, goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey committed a reckless challenge on Mehdi Taremi; he originally received a yellow card, but it was upgraded to a red after a VAR review. Iran went on to score twice in injury time, giving Wales a 2–0 defeat. That meant Wales needed a win in their final group match against England on 29 November. Although they managed to keep the score goalless in the first half, a direct free-kick from Marcus Rashford and a goal from Phil Foden in the space of two minutes all but confirmed Wales' elimination, and a second goal from Rashford completed a 3–0 defeat.\nSquad\nThe Wales squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\nGroup B\nMatches\nStandings\nStatistics.\nList of Wales players most appearances at World Cups.\nSeven players appeared in all five of Wales' matches at the 1958 World Cup.

        "title": "Mike Shea (baseball)",

        "text": "The FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup – Europe qualifier is a beach soccer championship that takes place to determine the nations who will represent Europe at the upcoming edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. It is contested between the senior men's national teams of the members of UEFA.\nIn 2006, FIFA made qualification to the World Cup mandatory (previously, nations were simply invited). Originally, the Euro Beach Soccer League (EBSL) doubled as Europe's qualification tournament; in 2008, this separate championship was created as the European qualification route. FIFA currently allocate Europe five berths at the World Cup and hence the top five teams qualify to the World Cup finals.[see notes] Coinciding with the annual staging of the World Cup, the competition took place yearly until 2010; the World Cup then became biennial, and as its supplementary qualification event, the championship followed suit.\nBeach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) have organised the event since its inception. Europe's governing body for football, UEFA, only began involvement in 2019 – sending delegates and financial support. Unlike the World Cup qualifiers for UEFA in football, it is a knockout tournament with a champion crowned. Its large scale and competitiveness are often noted, making it viewed as a major title to win.\nSpain are the most successful team with four titles. However, Portugal have secured qualification to the World Cup on the most occasions (seven).\nFounding.\nIn 2006, FIFA declared that for teams to enter the World Cup, they now must qualify (previously, most teams entered by invitation). Qualification tournaments were subsequently established in all continental zones, except for Europe. For European teams, a qualification process had already been implemented for the previous handful of World Cups – the top placed teams of the most recent season of the Euro Beach Soccer League (EBSL) earned qualification to the upcoming edition of the World Cup. Thus, the EBSL continued to double as the qualifying route for European teams.\nIn 2008, FIFA proclaimed that the next editions of the World Cup would take place in different countries. Until that point, all World Cups had been held in Brazil during summertime of the Southern Hemisphere, months after the conclusion of that year's EBSL season. That year, the World Cup was held in Marseille, France, and during a different time of the year – in July. The usual European qualification route, the EBSL, was not due to conclude until weeks after the World Cup had taken place. This separate knockout tournament, dedicated purely to determining the teams qualifying to the World Cup, was organised instead; free to be placed anywhere in the calendar, it took place in the May. It \"made history\", becoming the biggest international beach soccer event ever held at the time with 24 participants. It has since returned in all future years as Europe's qualification tournament. The organisers, Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), decided not to revert to using the EBSL.\nResults.\nFor all tournaments, the top four teams qualified for the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup (except for 2009 and 2019, when the top five teams qualified).\nPerformance.\nAll-time top goalscorers.\n\"As of 2023\"\nThe following table shows the all-time top 25 goalscorers.\nAll-time table.\n\"As of 2023\"\nKey:\nAppearances App / Won in normal time W = 3 points / Won in extra-time W+ = 2 points / Won on penalty shoot-out W = 1 point / Lost L = 0 points / Points per game PPG\nAppearances &amp; performance timeline.\nThe following is a performance timeline of the teams who have appeared in the UEFA qualifiers and how many appearances they each have made.\nPerformance of qualifiers at the World Cup.\nThe following is a performance timeline of the UEFA teams who have gone on to appear in the World Cup, having qualified from the above events."

        "text": "William Francis Denehy (born March 31, 1946) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and coach. Denehy threw and batted right-handed, stood tall, and weighed . He was born in Middletown, Connecticut and attended Middletown Woodrow Wilson High School.\nThe second-ever Middletown Little League alumnus to play Major League Baseball, he signed with the New York Mets out of high school for a $20,000 bonus and made his professional debut with the Auburn Mets of the New York–Penn League (then Class A) in 1965. He led the league in wins with 13, and the following season won nine of 11 decisions with the Double-A Williamsport Mets of the Eastern League, compiling a stellar 1.97 earned run average. In 1967, Denehy made 15 Major League appearances for the Mets, dropping seven of eight decisions with an ERA of 4.67. The 1967 Mets finished in tenth and last place, the fifth cellar-dwelling team in the expansion club's six-year history.\nTraded for manager Gil Hodges.\nOn November 27, 1967, the Mets traded Denehy to the Washington Senators for the Senators' manager, Gil Hodges, who was then in the middle of a multi-year contract he had signed as Washington's skipper. The Mets' managerial post was open after the late-season departure of Wes Westrum, and team officials began negotiations with the Senators to release Hodges from his contract, which still had a year to run.\nHodges was a New York baseball legend as the power-hitting and Gold Glove-fielding first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. He had become a year-round resident of Brooklyn, and in the twilight of his playing career was an original Met, starting at first base in their maiden NL game in 1962. On May 23, 1963, the Mets had traded Hodges to Washington for centerfielder Jimmy Piersall, and Hodges immediately retired as an active player to become the Senators' manager. Although the expansion-era Senators had themselves never posted a winning record since their 1961 inception, the team had shown steady season-to-season improvement since Hodges' appointment as manager. During the three-week-long winter interleague trading period then in effect, the Mets agreed to send Denehy and $100,000 as compensation for Washington's release of Hodges from his contract.\nCareer with Senators, Tigers.\nWhile Hodges brought home an improved, but still ninth-place, Mets' team in 1968, Denehy pitched in only three innings for the 1968 Senators and spent most of the season in the minor leagues. The following season, Denehy remained in Triple-A and was traded in June to the Cleveland Indians' organization. Meanwhile, in his second year as the Mets' manager, Hodges led the \"1969 Miracle Mets\" to the team's first National League and World Series championships.\nDenehy returned to the Majors with the 1971 Detroit Tigers, appearing in 31 games, all but one of them in relief, compiling an 0–3 mark with an ERA of 4.22 in 49 innings.\nAll told, Denehy appeared in 49 Major League games, winning one and losing ten (.091) with an ERA of 4.56 in 104 innings pitched. He retired after the 1973 season.\nCoaching career.\nFor two seasons (1981–1982), Denehy served as the pitching coach for the Double-A Bristol Red Sox. In the 1983 season, he served a third season as pitching coach in the Red Sox minor league system, this time with the Red Sox new affiliate, the New Britain Red Sox (now the Hartford Yard Goats).\nFrom the start of the 1985 season until the middle of the 1987 season, Denehy was the head college baseball coach of the Hartford Hawks. Following an April 1987 game against UConn in which two bench-clearing brawls broke out, Denehy was fired for making inflammatory remarks made about Connecticut's team and Connecticut assistant coach Mitch Pietras. Under Denehy, the Hawks had a 17–79 record.\nRetirement.\nDenehy has also worked in real estate, television and radio and taught golf.\nDenehy began losing his eyesight in 2005 and, , is legally blind with no vision in his right eye and glaucoma and macular holes in his left. He has received multiple grants from the Baseball Assistance Team to assist in paying for eye surgeries as he is ineligible for a pension from Major League Baseball under pre-1980 rules."

        "title": "1957 Little League World Series",
        "text": "The Little League World Series took place during August 21 through 23 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Industrial Little League of Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, defeated Northern La Mesa Little League of La Mesa, California, in the championship game of the 11th Little League World Series. Ángel Macías threw the first and, to date, only perfect game in an LLWS championship.\nThis was the first LLWS to invite teams from qualifying regions: North, South, East, and West. Monterrey, representing the South region, became the first team from outside the United States or Canada to participate in a LLWS, and the first non-U.S. team to win a championship.\nIndustrial Little League of Monterrey.\nIn 1956, Monterrey was granted a Little League license. They assembled a four-team league consisting of teams from different factories, the Botelleros, Mineros, Tubitos, and Incas. Many of the kids came from low-income families and even worked in the factories themselves. Before the teams could play, they had to clear the field of rocks and broken glass. They even had to use homemade gloves and equipment. The league had a try out for a Little League team that would represent the city. The coach, Cesar Faz, recruited the kids. He became known as a great baseball coach and was considered one of the best at motivating a youth baseball team. After two exhibition games in Mexico the team's historic run to Williamsport began. However, they did not even know Williamsport existed. In July 1957, they took a bus to Reynosa, Mexico. From there, they crossed the border on foot. They walked on a bridge over the Rio Grande and continued to their hotel in McAllen. In McAllen, they played a U.S. subregional tournament. The team won their first game against a team from Mexico City, 9 to 2. They went on to defeat the McAllen All Stars, the Mission All Stars, the Weslaco All Stars, and the Western Brownsville All Stars to advance to a regional tournament in Corpus Christi. While there, they beat another team from Mexico City and then beat the Houston All Stars. The team then travelled to Fort Worth to play in the Texas State Tournament. Up until that point they had beat every team by five or more runs. However, in the state semifinals they needed extra innings to beat another Houston All Star team, 5 to 4. After they survived that game, they destroyed the Waco All Stars, 11 to 2 to advance to the South Regional. After the state tournament, the team got on a plane and flew to Louisville, Kentucky for the Southern Regionals. The winner of the Southern Regional was going to represent the south in the Little League World Series in Williamsport. Their first game was against Biloxi, Mississippi. They won that game 13 to 0. The next game, for the Southern Regional Championship, was against Owensboro, Kentucky. They won that game 3 to 0. The Monterrey Little League was headed to the Little League World Series. The team loaded up on to a bus and headed 700 miles northwest to Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Teams from Canada and Mexico had made it before, but they had never won the tournament or even reached the finals before.\nAdversity.\nDuring all this, their visas expired. The U.S. ambassador to Mexico had to intervene to keep them legally in the country. This allowed them to keep playing, yet it didn't solve all of their issues. While traveling, the team was subjected to racial injustice and Jim Crow laws, as was the norm during the Segregation Era. They were not allowed in some places and were refused service many times, something they never had to face in Mexico. The team was young, in a foreign country, and away from their families (Only one of the players had ever left Monterrey). The team also didn't have a lot of money for food, only being able to eat twice a day. It was only through the kindness of strangers and a few new friends who fed them, offered them meals at restaurants, and gave them some money after a win, that they were able to keep going.\nWilliamsport.\nWhen they arrived in Williamsport, the Little League officials gave them new uniforms that said \"South\" across the chest. However, the uniforms did not fit because they were so much smaller than all the other teams. The boys from Monterrey averaged 4 feet 11 inches and 92 pounds. While the other teams average 5 feet 4 inches and 127 pounds. Unfazed, they beat Bridgeport, Connecticut, 2 to 1, to reach the championship game. They were set to face La Mesa, California, who easily beat Escanaba, Michigan. Many people believed that the boys from Monterrey had little chance to win. Even some of the Monterrey players were questioning what would happen to them the next day. The coach, Cesar Faz, decided to name Angel Macias as the starting pitcher for the championship game. What he did that day led him to become known as \"The Little Big Man\". He stood 5-feet tall and weighed 88-pounds. He was an ambidextrous pitcher. However, he decided to only throw with his right hand in this game. He was known to have a great fastball, but an even better curveball. The first batter, Lew Riley, hit a hard line drive down the first base line, on the first pitch of the game. It was foul by an inch. That was the closest La Mesa, California would come to a hit all afternoon. In front of ten thousand people and all the people listening in Mexico on the radio, Macias proceeded to be perfect. He did not allow a batter to get on a base. He struck out 11 out of the 18 batters he faced. No ball even left the infield. With two outs in the 6th inning, La Mesa's Bryon Haggard stepped into the box. Macias quickly fell behind in the count 3–0. He proceeded to battle back and threw two strikes to make the count full. Macias then winded up and threw a curveball that made Haggard swing and miss. The crowd exploded. Macias had done what no one else had done before. He had thrown a perfect game in the LLWS championship game. However, no one on the team even knew what a perfect game was. The team from Monterrey had made history, they became the first team from outside the United States to win the Little League World Series.\nAftermath.\nThe next morning, the story was getting national and international coverage and attention. Newspaper and News station could not stop talking about the team from Monterrey. After they won the Little League World Series, the team's first thought was to go home. However, it would be almost a month until the team returned to Monterrey. They began their victory tour by traveling by bus to New York City. While they were there, the Brooklyn Dodgers invited them to be their guest at Ebbets Field. The team then went shopping at Macy's Department Store and were each given $40 to spend. After leaving New York, the team headed to Washington D.C. While they were there, they met with President Dwight Eisenhower, Vice President Richard Nixon, and future president Lyndon B. Johnson. The team then travelled to Mexico City. The team met with Mexican President Ruiz Cortinez and attended celebrations. They were considered national heroes. The team then flew from Mexico City to their hometown of Monterrey. When they arrived, they were met with tens of thousands of people in the streets. A parade was organized for the team. It started at the airport and stretched to the Government Palace. During the parade, people were trying to take parts of their uniforms, hats, belts, cleats as memorabilia and souvenirs. After the parade, the Mexican Government awarded all 14 members of the team a scholarship for both high school and college education. However, only two of them ever actually went to college. According to a few of the players, everywhere they went people recognized them and wanted autographs. The team also went on to win the championship in 1958 as well. As the kids grew up, they all went their separate ways. Angel Macias was signed by The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim at the age of 16. He was invited to their spring training in 1961. He played for a couple of years as an outfielder in the minor leagues. He advanced as far as the Class A California League. Macias then went on to have a twelve-year career in the Mexican League, where he played for the Leon Broncos, Broncos de Reynosa, and the Monterrey Sultanes. After his playing career, he ran the Mexican Academy, which is a minor league circuit. He was inducted into Little League Hall of Excellence in 2017. One of the other players, Jose \"Pepe\" Maiz, also was inducted in 2005. Both Maiz and Macias did a lot for the growth of baseball in Mexico. Maiz also runs a construction company and owns the Monterrey Sultanes. There were two movies made about the 1957 Monterrey Little League's historic run: a 1960 Mexican production called \"Los Pequeños Gigantes\" and a 2009 film called \"The Perfect Game\". Episode 296 of the Futility Closet podcast covers the team and their Little League World Series championship.\nChampionship bracket.\nCalifornia's first game was played a day later than planned, due to illness within the team, resulting in the third-place game also being delayed a day."

They won 29 games in a row including the conference semi-final and finals and the second round of the NCAA Tournament. SFA repeated the same feat in their 2015–2016 season by going 18–0 in conference and reaching the second round of the NCAA once again, but lost in a heartbreaker by Rex Pflueger's putback which gave Notre Dame a 76-75 win over the Lumberjacks.\nOn May 20, 2020, following the discovery of an administrative error in certifying eligibility for student-athletes, Stephen F. Austin reached an agreement with the NCAA to vacate hundreds of wins across multiple sports from 2013 to 2019, including all 117 men's basketball wins from the 2014–15 to 2018–19 seasons. As a result, three NCAA tournament appearances and three Southland conference titles were nullified.\nSFA is one of four schools, all from Texas, that left the Southland Conference on July 1, 2021 to join the Western Athletic Conference (WAC).

        "title": "List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 30 or more rebounds in a game",
        "text": "In basketball, a rebound is the act of gaining possession of the ball after an unsuccessful field goal or free throw. Players on this list have all recorded 30 or more rebounds in a single game. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". Additionally, the NCAA recognizes two different eras in college basketball history when it comes to the statistic of rebounding: the pre-1973 era and the post-1973 era. In the pre-1973 era (otherwise known as the era before the divisional setup), opponents may have been less talented and from smaller schools (such as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics [NAIA] or Divisions II and III in today's classification). Although the 1972–73 season was before the divisional split, the NCAA officially considers that season to be \"post-1973\" because of the adoption of freshman eligibility for varsity play in all NCAA sports effective in August 1972. Therefore, the all-time single game rebound record is 51, set by Bill Chambers of William &amp; Mary in 1953. Chambers' 51-rebound effort contributed to a Virginia state record of 100 team rebounds by the Tribe against UVA. The post-1973 era record is 35, set by Fresno State's Larry Abney on February 17, 2000. Abney's modern-day record has never seen any real challenge to be broken; the closest another player has come were 30-rebound efforts by Rashad Jones-Jennings of Arkansas–Little Rock in 2005 and Kendall Gray of Delaware State in 2015.\nSeven players on this list have been enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Dave DeBusschere, Artis Gilmore, Tom Heinsohn, Bailey Howell and Maurice Stokes. John Tresvant of Seattle, who recorded 40 rebounds on February 8, 1963, claims that he finished the game against Montana with more: \"Actually, I had 44 (rebounds). I know I got more when I went back over the game. The guy keeping the stats told me later he didn't mark them all down.\"\nIf true, this would have placed Tresvant second all-time for rebounds in a game, but still well behind Chambers' mark. Among players on the list, only one freshman has \"officially\" recorded 30 or more rebounds. Durand \"Rudy\" Macklin of LSU set the school record as a freshman on November 26, 1976, when he grabbed 32 rebounds against Tulane. Robert Parish of Centenary, also a Hall of Famer, had one performance that would have made him the first freshman to record 30 or more rebounds; he collected 33 against Southern Mississippi on January 27, 1973. However, due to sanctions related to Parish's recruitment, the NCAA omitted all Centenary games and statistics from its official records starting with his freshman year of 1972–73 and continuing through the 1977–78 season, two years after Parish's graduation.\nDates of 30+ rebounds.\nPre-1973 era.\nNote: Since there were so many occurrences of individual players grabbing 30+ rebounds during the pre-1973 college basketball era, the official NCAA men's basketball media guide cut the list off at some of the instances of 34 rebounds and more. This list, therefore, is not comprehensive, but the post-1973 era list is."

The only directive of the Department was that the reclaimed land be vegetated and protected from erosion, and a golf course fit that bill.

        "text": "This article details the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round.\nThere were two paths:\nEach tie was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finished level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time were played, divided into two 15-minute halves. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided via a penalty shoot-out.\n\"All times are CEST ().\"\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\nTeams.\nBelow are the 54 teams (39 in Champions Path, 15 in Non-Champions path) that were involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round, grouped by their starting rounds. The ten winners of the play-off round (five in Champions Path, five in Non-Champions Path) qualified for the group stage to join the 22 automatic qualifiers. The losing teams from the third qualifying round and the play-off round entered the Europa League play-off round and the group stage, respectively.\nIn each round, teams were seeded based on their 2010 UEFA club coefficients. Prior to the draw, UEFA could form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition, while ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other.\nFirst qualifying round.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Q1 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Q1 /&gt;\nSecond qualifying round.\nMatches.\n&lt;section begin=Q2 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Q2 /&gt;\nFirst leg.\n\"Sparta Prague won 5–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Aktobe won 3–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Debrecen won 4–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"Partizan won 4–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"1–1 on aggregate; Lech Poznań won on penalties.\"\n\"Dinamo Zagreb won 5–4 on aggregate.\"\n\"Litex Lovech won 5–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Žilina won 3–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Sheriff Tiraspol won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Hapoel Tel Aviv won 6–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Omonia won 5–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Red Bull Salzburg won 5–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"The New Saints won 4–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"BATE won 6–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"AIK won 1–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Rosenborg won 2–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"HJK won 2–1 on aggregate.\"\nThird qualifying round.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Q3 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Q3 /&gt;\nMatches.\n\"Sparta won 2–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Hapoel Tel Aviv won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate; Sheriff Tiraspol won on penalties.\"\n\"Žilina won 4–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Basel won 5–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Rosenborg won 4–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Partizan won 5–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Anderlecht won 6–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Copenhagen won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Red Bull Salzburg won 5–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"4–4 on aggregate; Ajax won on away goals.\"\n\"Dynamo Kyiv won 6–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Young Boys won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Braga won 4–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Zenit Saint Petersburg won 1–0 on aggregate.\"\nPlay-off round.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=play-off /&gt;\n&lt;section end=play-off /&gt;\nMatches.\n\"Hapoel Tel Aviv won 4–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate; Copenhagen won on away goals.\"\n\"Basel won 4–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Žilina won 3–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"4–4 on aggregate; Partizan won on penalties.\"\n\"Tottenham won 6–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"Braga won 5–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"Werder Bremen won 5–4 on aggregate.\"\n\"Auxerre won 2–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Ajax won 3–2 on aggregate.\""

The matchdays were 14–15 September, 28–29 September, 19–20 October, 2–3 November, 23–24 November, and 7–8 December 2010.\nThe top two teams in each group advanced to the first knockout round, while the third-placed teams dropped down to the Europa League round of 32.\nPartizan and Žilina became only the eleventh and twelfth teams in UEFA Champions League history to lose all six group stage matches.\nSeeding.\nThe draw for the group stage was held in Monaco on 26 August 2010 at 18:00 CEST ().\nTeams were seeded into four pots based on their 2010 UEFA club coefficients. The title holders, Internazionale, were automatically seeded into Pot 1. Teams from the same national association could not be drawn against each other.

Based on this principle, the draw was controlled for clubs from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw. There were certain restrictions, e.g., teams from the same city (e.g. Milan and Internazionale, which also shared a stadium) did not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tried to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days), and Russian teams did not play at home on the last matchday due to cold weather.\nTie-breaking criteria.\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria would be applied to determine the rankings:\nGroups.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times are in parentheses).\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup H.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "James P. Flynn (23 June 1894 – 1965) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative centre and half-back. His representative career lasted from 1912 to 1914 and he captained the national side on one occasion in 1913, the youngest player to ever do so. He was later a Queensland state selector.\nRugby career.\nBorn in Brisbane, Queensland, Flynn was schooled at St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace. His first grade career was played with the Brothers Old Boys club in Brisbane. He was a prodigious talent and was first selected to represent at Queensland state level one day before his 18th birthday. In that 1912 interstate series Queensland won dual home game victories for the first time since 1901.\nFlynn was selected in the Wallabies squad for the 1912 Australia rugby union tour of Canada and the United States. The tour was a disappointment with the squad billeted out in college fraternity houses where the hospitality played havoc with team discipline and as result the team lost against two California University sides and three Canadian provincial sides. Flynn played in ten of the tour matches but was not selected in the sole Test. He suffered the ignominy of being sent off in the match against a Combined Vancouver-Victoria side and Howell suggests he was probably the first Australian half-back on tour to do so.\nHe had state representative success in 1913 with appearances against the New Zealand Maori and against New South Wales. Still aged only nineteen, he captained Queensland to victory in the second match of that year's interstate series kicking four goals including a conversion on the bell to snatch a one-point victory. His Test debut was made in 1914 when he played in both fixtures against the touring All Blacks. In the second Test on 1 August 1914 he had the honour of captaining the Wallaby side and at twenty years and seven months his record still stands as the youngest man to do so.\nThe Great War interrupted Flynn's career as rugby in Australia effectively ceased in that time. Post-war he made two appearances for Australia against an AIF side in 1919. Although rugby would stay in demise in Queensland until 1929, Flynn had a hand in its rebirth as a Queensland and national selector in 1929 and 1930.\nHe claimed two international rugby caps for Australia."

        "text": "Hitchin Cricket Club Ground is a cricket ground in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England. The first recorded match on the ground was in 1877, when Hertfordshire played Essex. Hertfordshire played their first Minor Counties Championship match on the ground in 1908 against Cambridgeshire. Hertfordshire used the ground until 1914, and following a 37-year break from the ground, it returned in 1951. From 1914 to 1998, the ground played host to 38 Minor Counties Championship matches and 2 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.\nThe ground has also hosted List-A matches, the first of which came in the 1966 Gillette Cup between Hertfordshire and Berkshire. From 1966 to 1989, the ground held 8 List-A matches, the last of which was between Hertfordshire and Nottinghamshire in the 1989 NatWest Trophy. The most famous List-A match on the ground saw Hertfordshire defeat first-class county Essex in the 1976 Gillette Cup.\nIn local domestic cricket, Hitchin Cricket Club Ground is the home ground of Hitchin Cricket Club. They play in the Hertfordshire Cricket League, their best position being in 1976 and in 2009 when they came second. The club shares their ground with the Blueharts Hockey Club and Hitchin Lacrosse Club. In 1988, the club constructed a second pitch at the ground.\nPerhaps the biggest claim to fame for the club was in 1994, when the New Zealand cricket team started their tour of England with a match against Hitchin. The ground was also the scene of Hertfordshire County Cricket Club's victory over Essex County Cricket Club in the 1976 Gillette Cup - the first time a minor county had defeated a first class county in a major competition."

        "text": "The NYU Violets men's basketball team is the college basketball team that represents New York University, located in New York City. The team currently competes in NCAA Division III as a member of the University Athletic Association. NYU previously competed as an NCAA Division I program until 1971, when the team was disbanded due to a budget crisis. The team was reinstated in 1983 as a Division III program.\nNYU played in two NCAA Division I Final Fours, and can lay claim to two national championships predating the creation of the NCAA tournament (1920 and 1935). NYU has also had success in the Division III NCAA tournament, including a runner-up finish at the 1994 tournament.\nDivision I history.\nWhile a member of Division I, the Violets' basketball team registered a great deal of success. An early member who starred for the team in 1910 and 1911 was Lazarus Joseph (1891–1966), later a NY State Senator and New York City Comptroller.\nThe school's best NCAA tournament result was finishing runner-up to Oklahoma State (then Oklahoma A&amp;M), coached by the legendary Henry Iba. at the 1945 NCAA tournament. NYU returned to the Final Four in 1960, losing to Ohio State, whose roster featured Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek.\nNYU achieved even more success in the years before the advent of the NCAA tournament in 1939. In 1920 NYU won the Amateur Athletic Union national championship tournament, led by the Helms Athletic Foundation Player of the Year, Howard Cann. Cann returned to coach at NYU after graduation, serving as head basketball coach from 1923 to 1958 and leading NYU to notable success. The Violets were undefeated in the 1933–1934 season, posting a 16–0 record. After winning the first ten games to start the following season, the school's winning streak was broken in an overtime loss at Yale. The loss to Yale was the only setback during the 1934–1935 season, during which NYU finished 19–1 and was named the best team in the nation (retrospectively) by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Finally, the year before the NCAA tournament was created, NYU reached the Final Four at the 1938 National Invitation Tournament.\nFor the seasons before the AP Poll began ranking college basketball teams in 1949, the Premo-Porretta Poll retrospectively ranks NYU among the final top 5 teams nationally for a number of seasons, including #1 in 1935, #2 in 1909 and 1934, #3 in 1920, #4 in 1921, and #5 in 1930. NYU also appeared in the first AP Poll issued, on January 18, 1949. The school made its final appearance in the Division I AP Poll ranked at #10 on December 24, 1964.\nThe Violets' most recent post-season accomplishment as a Division I college was finishing as the runner-up to BYU in the 1966 National Invitation Tournament. NYU previously also finished as runner-up in the 1948 National Invitation Tournament, and in third place in the 1959 National Invitation Tournament.\nNYU was a member of the Metropolitan New York Conference from 1933 to 1963, and won four conference titles after the conference officially began sponsoring men's basketball in 1946.\nThe program was disbanded following a disastrous 5–20 season in 1970–71. When NYU ended its program, the Violets were still tied for 14th nationally in Final Four appearances (2), and 28th nationally in all-time appearances at the NCAA Division I tournament (6).\nDivision III history.\nNYU has once again found success since its reestablishment as a Division III program in 1983.\nThe school appeared in seven consecutive Division III NCAA basketball tournaments from 1992 to 1998. In 1994 NYU advanced to the Final Four and finished as the national runner-up to Lebanon Valley College. The 1994 team also established a school record by winning 25 games.\nPostseason history.\nDivision I NCAA.\nIn their times in Division I, the Violets appeared in the NCAA Tournament six times. Their record was 9–8.\nNIT.\nNYU appeared in 8 NITs and compiled and overall record of 13–11.\nIndividual accolades.\nThe following NYU players and coaches are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (with induction year):\nNational and Metro honors.\nNYU players and coaches have won the following national and regional awards:\nPlayer honors\nCoaching honors\nConference honors.\nThe University Athletic Association began awarding Conference Player of the Year and Coaching Staff of the Year awards when it was founded in 1987."

        "text": "The SMU Mustangs men's basketball team represents Southern Methodist University (SMU) in University Park, Texas and currently competes in the American Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I college basketball. In 104 years of basketball, SMU's record is 1,377–1,237. SMU has reached one Final Four, made 12 NCAA Tournament Appearances, won 16 Conference Championships, had 11 All-Americans, and 23 NBA Draft selections.\nSMU finished the 2016–17 season with a 30–5 record, and won their second conference title in three years. They set the school record for single season wins, and returned to the NCAA Tournament following a postseason ban in the 2015–16 season.\nHistory.\n1916: The Beginning.\n1916 was the inaugural season of SMU basketball where it went 12–2. SMU joined the Southwest Conference in the 1918–19 season. SMU won its first two conference titles in 1935 and 1937.\n1955-1967: The Doc Hayes Era (Golden Era of Pony Hoops).\nDoc Hayes took over as SMU's head coach in 1947. By 1955 Hayes had SMU in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history advancing to the Sweet Sixteen and had won their first conference title in almost 20 years. The four year stretch from 1955–58, SMU went 77–28, won four consecutive Southwest Conference championships, and reached 3 Sweet Sixteen's while also reaching the school's only ever Final Four in the 1955-56 season, led by All-American Jim Krebs. SMU during the Doc Hayes era won 8 SWC championships and reached the NCAA tournament 6 times including Final Four and Elite Eight appearances. Doc Hayes retired after the 1967 season with a final record of 298–191 (.609) at SMU.\n1968-1993: The Fall to Mediocrity.\nFollowing Doc Hayes, SMU basketball fell down into a period of mediocrity with some sprinkled success highlighted by SMU greats Jon Koncak, Ira Terrell, and Gene Phillips. Though the Bob Prewitt and Sonny Allen eras were largely unsuccessful and only produced one Southwest Conference Championship during a stretch between 1968 and 1980 the program looked to be back on the rise during the Dave Bliss era. Bliss and star big man Jon Koncak led SMU to 3 NCAA tournament appearances and an NIT appearance. The Dave Bliss era was highlighted by his final season where SMU went 28–7 winning the SWC regular season and tournament championships and making it to the Second round of the NCAA Tournament. SMU would win the SWC Championship and reach the NCAA tournament one more time in the 1993 season under John Shumate, however, this was the start of the Dark Ages of SMU basketball.\n1994-2012: The Dark Ages.\nThis period was the dark age for SMU basketball. From 1994 to 2012 SMU had just seven winning seasons and did not win any conference titles or reach the NCAA tournament. The Mustangs only reached the NIT and CIT once each during these nineteen years.\n2012-2016: The Larry Brown Era.\nThe reemergence of SMU basketball occurred when Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown took over the Mustangs in the 2012 season, coinciding with the $48 million renovation of Moody Coliseum. By his second season, he had led SMU to a 27–10 record, and to a championship appearance in the NIT. In his third season, (2014–15) led by Nic Moore, SMU won its first conference title in 22 years (regular season and tournament champions), and returned to the NCAA tournament, losing a controversial game to UCLA on a goaltending call. In the 2015–16 season, SMU was banned from postseason play due to NCAA violations, but still managed to start the season with an unprecedented 18–0 record, peaking at the #8 spot in the AP Poll, and finish the season at 25–5. It was SMU's third straight 25+ win season. In the summer of 2016, Brown stepped down as SMU's basketball coach unexpectedly, finishing with a record of 85–39(.685). He currently holds the third-highest W-L percentage of any head coach in SMU basketball history.\n2016–2024: Maintaining Success (Post Larry Brown).\nTim Jankovich took over in the summer of 2016 following the departure of Larry Brown. In his first full season as SMU's head coach, SMU achieved a 30–4 overall record, including a 17-1 in-conference record, and finished ranked #11 in the AP Poll. The Mustangs won the 2016–17 American Athletic Conference regular season and conference tournament titles, and received a bid to the NCAA tournament as a 6 seed, where they were upset by 11th seeded USC by one point in the opening round. Following the season, Junior standout Semi Ojeleye announced that he would not be returning for his final year, joining seniors Sterling Brown and \nBen Moore in entering the NBA draft where both Ojeleye and Brown were selected 37th and 46th overall, respectively. Ben Moore spent 27 games with the G League team, Fort Wayne Mad Ants where he averaged 11.4 points per game and 6.7 rebounds per game. He was recently signed to a two way contract with the Indiana Pacers on January 12, 2018. This marks the first time an SMU player has been drafted since 2001. This is also the first time SMU has ever had 3 players join their first NBA rosters in the same season, topping the previous high of 1.\n2024: Move to the ACC.\nIn July 2024, SMU will leave The American for the Atlantic Coast Conference, returning SMU to the power-conference ranks for the first time since the collapse of the Southwest Conference.\nPostseason.\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Mustangs have appeared in 12 NCAA Tournaments.

The school's team currently competes in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. They currently play their home games at the Fredrick C. Hobdy Assembly Center. They made their first ever appearance to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2024.\nHistory.\nThe glory years of the Tigers were led by Fred Hobdy, who led the Tigers to eight SWAC regular season titles (five outright) during his coaching tenure. Hobdy went 572-288 as head coach from 1957 to 1986, which saw them play in NCAA Division II and the NAIA. They reached the Elite Eight of the Division II tournament in 1958 and won the NAIA title in 1961. Notable players during this time were Willis Reed, who was an NAIA All-American before becoming drafted by the New York Knicks; Reed was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982. \nThe Tigers advanced to the 1980 SWAC men's basketball tournament against Alcorn State (the regular season champion) for a chance to reach the NCAA Division I Tournament but lost 83–61. In 1986, Hobdy retired, later serving as athletic director for the program from 1989 to 1996 prior to his death in 1998 (years later, Grambling's new Assembly Center would be named after him). The 1986-87 team won the regular season championship but were walloped 105-55 by Southern in the SWAC Final. They returned to the Final the following year and lost again to Southern 78–62. Grambling won a share of the regular season title for the 1988-89 season with Southern and Texas Southern after each had 10-4 records, but Grambling lost in the Semifinals to Texas Southern, who then lost to Southern. The Tigers, with a record of 8–10 in SWAC play and seeded 6th, pulled off two shocking upsets (of three-seeded Mississippi Valley State and two-seeded Jackson State) to advance to the final round of the SWAC men's basketball tournament for the fourth time in program history in 2011 but lost to fourth-seeded Alabama State. \nThe 2012–13 team became the eighth NCAA Division I team to finish a season winless. The 2022–23 Tigers team returned to the SWAC Tournament title game for the fifth time in school history only to lose against Texas Southern, 58–61, for the right to advance to the NCAA Tournament. \nOn March 16, 2024, Grambling won the 2024 SWAC tournament after winning the regular season title, defeating the three-time defending champion Texas Southern, earning its first NCAA tournament bid in program history. The Tigers beat Montana State in the First Four, 88–81 in overtime, giving them their first win in the tournament.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Tigers appeared in one NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

        "title": "Sailing (sport)",
        "text": "The sport of sailing involves a variety of competitive sailing formats that are sanctioned through various sailing federations and yacht clubs. Racing disciplines include matches within a fleet of sailing craft, between a pair thereof or among teams. Additionally, there are specialized competitions that include setting speed records. Racing formats include both closed courses and point-to-point contests; they may be in sheltered waters, coast-wise or on the open ocean. Most competitions are held within defined classes or ratings that either entail one type of sailing craft to ensure a contest primarily of skill or rating the sailing craft to create classifications or handicaps.\nOn the water, a sailing competition among multiple vessels is called a regatta. A Regatta consists of multiple individual races. The boat crew that performs best in over the series of races is the overall winner. There is a broad variety of kinds of races and sailboats used for racing from large yacht to dinghy racing. Much racing is done around buoys or similar marks in protected waters, while some longer offshore races cross open water. All kinds of boats are used for racing, including small dinghies, catamarans, boats designed primarily for cruising, and purpose-built raceboats. The Racing Rules of Sailing govern the conduct of yacht racing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, model boat racing, dinghy racing and virtually any other form of racing around a course with more than one vessel while powered by the wind.\nThe Barcolana regatta of the Italian yacht club Società Velica di Barcola e Grignano is currently the Guinness World Record holder as the \"largest sailing race\" with 2,689 boats and over 16,000 sailors at the starting line.\nMembership.\nInternational federation.\nThe International Olympic Committee recognizes World Sailing (WS) as the world governing body for the sport of sailing yacht racing. It was formed in 1904 as the International Yacht Racing Union and then called the International Sailing Federation until rebranding 2014.\nYacht clubs.\nMany town yacht clubs maintain their own racing teams for both juniors and adults. Often several yacht clubs will get together to hold events that can include more than 100 entered boats per race making up the regatta. Although often both adults and juniors sail the same classes of boat.\nEvent disciplines.\nFleet racing.\nFleet races can have anywhere from four boats to hundreds of boats in a race. A regatta must have at least three races to be counted. Each boat's place in each race is added to compile a final score. The lowest scorer wins.\nMatch racing.\nIn match racing only two boats compete against each other. The best known competition of this type is the America's Cup. The tactics involved in match racing are different from those of other races, because the objective is merely to arrive at the finish line before the opponent, which is not necessarily as fast as possible. The tactics involved at the start are also special.\nTeam racing.\nTeam racing is most often between two teams of three boats each. It involves similar technique to match racing but has the added dimension that it is the overall scoring of the race that matters. In three on three team racing, this means that the team that scores ten or less points wins. For this reason, many tactics are used to advance teammates to make stable combinations for winning. The stable combinations most commonly sought are \"Play one\", which is 1-2-anything, \"Play two\" or 2-3-4, and \"Play 4\", a 1-4-5 combination. These are generally regarded as the best setups to win and the hardest for the opposing team to play offense against.\nSpeed Sailing.\nIs managed by World Speed Sailing Record Council\nWave riding.\nIs common to board sports.\nOthers.\nBoth windsurfing and kiteboarding are experimenting with new formats.\nCommon race formats.\nShort course racing.\nHarbor or buoy races are conducted in protected waters, and are quite short, usually taking anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. All sorts of sailing craft are used for these races, including keel-boats of all sizes, as well as dinghies, trailer sailors, catamarans, skiffs, sailboards, and other small craft.\nThis kind of race is most commonly run over one or more laps of a triangular course marked by a number of buoys. The course starts from an imaginary line drawn from a 'committee boat' to the designated 'starting' buoy or 'pin'. A number of warning signals are given telling the crews exactly how long until the race starts. The aim of each crew is to cross the start line at full speed exactly as the race starts. A course generally involves tacking upwind to a 'windward' marker or buoy. Then bearing away onto a downwind leg to a second jibe marker. Next another jibe on a second downwind leg to the last mark which is called the 'downwind mark' (or 'leeward mark'). At this mark the boats turn into wind once again to tack to the finish line.\nThe most famous and longest running of these events are:\nCoastal/Inshore racing.\nInshore racing is yacht racing not in protected waters but along and generally within sight of land or from land to nearby islands, as distinct from offshore racing across open water and oceans. The duration of races may be daylight only, overnight or passage races of several days. Some races, such as the Swiftsure Yacht Race, are actually a group of inshore races of various distances along overlapping courses to allow for different classes and skills. Depending on location, stability and safety equipment requirements will be more extensive than for harbor racing, but less so than for offshore racing. Different levels of requirement for navigation, sleeping cooking and water storage also apply.\nOffshore racing.\nOffshore yacht races are held over long distances and in open water; such races usually last for at least a number of hours. The longest offshore races involve a circumnavigation of the world.\nSome of the most famous offshore races are as follows\nOceanic racing.\nSeveral fully crewed round-the-world races are held, including:\nSouth African yacht clubs organise the South Atlantic Race (the former Cape to Rio race), the Governor's Cup from Cape Town to St. Helena Island, and a race between Durban and Mauritius.\nSingle-handed ocean yacht racing began with the race across the Atlantic Ocean by William Albert Andrews and Josiah W. Lawlor in 1891; however, the first regular single-handed ocean race was the Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, first held in 1960. The first round-the-world yacht race was the \"Sunday Times Golden Globe Race\" of 1968–1969, which was also a single-handed race with the only winner, Robin Knox-Johnston on \"Suhaili\"; this inspired the present-day Velux 5 Oceans Race (formerly the BOC Challenge / Around Alone) and the Vendée Globe. Single-handed racing has seen a great boom in popularity in recent years.\nThere is some controversy about the legality of sailing single-handed over long distances, as the navigation rules require \"that every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper lookout...\"; single-handed sailors can only keep a sporadic lookout, due to the need to sleep, tend to navigation, etc.\nOther races.\nCertain races do not fit in the above categories. One such is the Three peaks yacht race in the UK which is a team competition involving sailing, cycling and running.\nClasses and ratings.\nMany design factors have a large impact on the speed at which a boat can complete a course, including the size of a boat's sails, its length, and the weight and shape of its hull. Because of these differences, it can be difficult to compare the skills of the sailors in a race if they are sailing very different boats. For most forms of yacht racing, one of two solutions to this problem are used: either all boats are required to race on a first to finish basis (these groups of boats are called classes), or a handicapping system is used which implements correction factors.\nManufacturer controlled classes.\nEach class has a detailed set of specifications that must be met for the boat to be considered a member of that class. Some classes (e.g.the Laser) have very tight specifications ensuring that there is virtually no difference between the boats (except for age) - these classes are sometimes called \"strict one-design\".\nIn one-design racing all boats must conform to the same standard, the \"class rules\", thus emphasizing the skill of the skipper and crew rather than having the results depend on equipment superiority.\nThese kind of classes are most commonly brand linked to brands with Laser Performance, RS Sailing, Melges and J/Boats range being good examples.\nMeasurement controlled classes.\nPopular International Classes include the Optimist, 470, Snipe and Etchells.\nMeasurement classes box rule.\nA \"box rule\" specifies a maximum overall size for boats in the class, as well as features such as stability. Competitors in these classes are then free to enter their own boat designs, as long as they do not exceed the box rule. No handicap is then applied.\nMeasurement formula-based classes.\nA construction class is based on a formula or set of restrictions which the boat's measurements must fit to be accepted to the class. Resulting boats are all unique, yet (ideally) relatively close in size and performance. Perhaps the most popular and enduring construction formula is The Metre Rule, around which several still popular classes were designed. With the 12 metre being the most famous due to its involvement in the America's Cup.\nHandicap racing.\nWhen all the yachts in a race are not members of the same class, then a handicap is used to adjust the times of boats. The handicap attempts to specify a \"normal\" speed for each boat, usually based either on measurements taken of the boat, or on the past record of that kind of boat. Each boat is timed over the specified course. After it has finished, the handicap is used to adjust each boat's finishing time. The results are based on this sum.\nPopular handicapping systems include \nEarlier popular rating systems include IOR and IMS.\nGender criteria.\nThe majority of sailing events are \"open\" events in which males and females compete together on equal terms either as individuals or part of team. Sailing has had female only World Championships since the 1970s to encourage participation and now hosts more than 30 such World Championship titles each year. For the 2016 Olympics in Rio, compulsory mixed gender in the event were added for the first time.\nAdditional criteria.\nIn addition the following criteria are sometimes applied to events:"

        "text": "The RAN Women's Rugby Championship is the regional championship for women's international rugby union in North America and the Caribbean that is sanctioned by RAN.\nIn 2010 the former NAWIRA Caribbean Women's Rugby Championship became the NACRA Women's Rugby Championship, potentially broadening its coverage in accordance with the widened aim of its recently renamed sponsor. In 2015 NACRA was rebranded to Rugby Americas North as part of a global renaming policy.\nHistory.\nInitially named the NAWIRA Caribbean Women's Rugby Championship, it was a small tournament run by the IRB through NAWIRA. Rugby sevens is a growing inter-island sport, but the full 15-a-side game is significantly more resource intensive and so it was only with the financial support of the IRB that the first tournament took place in December 2003.\nOnly Trinidad and Jamaica took part in the first event, Trinidad winning both legs in Port of Spain. In September 2006 a second event was organised, this time in Kingston, Jamaica and featuring Guyana. The hosts were again winners by the narrowest of margins.\nThe tournament took place annually, however the 2007 edition was cancelled. It was arranged to take place in the Cayman Islands, starting 19 August 2007, but was cancelled the day before it was due to start as a result of Hurricane Dean. Three teams had been due to take part - Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago.\nAfter 2009 NAWIRA was reorganised as NACRA (North America and Caribbean Rugby Association) in order to better encourage participation by unions outside the English-speaking West Indies. From 2010 the tournament became the NACRA Women's Rugby Championship. However, a separate play-off for the Caribbean title was organised for the island teams taking part.\nThe popularity of rugby sevens among other things caused a decline in the fifteens code, the 2011 tournament being the last time the 15-a-side game was played. After the formation of RAN the ten-a-side version of the game has been played with hopes of reviving fifteens.\nOn November 16, 2021 RAN announced the first-ever Women’s 12-a-side tournament to be held in Cayman Islands from December 4 to 5. Originally announced as a ten-a-side tournament, competing nations agreed to increase their teams by two players. The purpose of the tournament was to increase competition for women in the region and to allow nations to continue building towards 15s. The tournament was cancelled due to travel restrictions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2023, RAN confirmed the return of Women’s fifteens after a successful 12-a-side tournament held in Jamaica in 2022.\nAppearances.\nSix nations have taken part in the Caribbean Women's Rugby Championships held to date:"

Eighteen of his New South Wales state appearances have since been decreed as Test matches by the Australian Rugby Union and Sheehan, who led the side in three such matches in 1923, was therefore a captain of the Australian national team.\nRugby career.\nFollowing his time at The King's School in Sydney, Sheehan was accepted to study medicine at Sydney University and stated his club rugby at the Sydney University Football Club. He won university blues in 1921, 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1927 and captained the club to premiership victory in the Shute Shield in 1923 and 1924.\nHis representative debut came in 1921 when the South African national rugby union team made their inaugural tour of Australia and Sheehan was picked at half-back for New South Wales in all three matches against them. With no Queensland Rugby Union administration or competition in place from 1919 to 1929, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of their 1920s fixtures played against full international opposition were decreed in 1986 as official Test matches, including the three of Sheehan's 1921 debut and fifteen other appearances he would make over the next six years.\nIn 1922 he appeared in all three Test in Sydney against the visiting All Blacks. In 1923 New Zealand Māori rugby union team visited and Sheehan played all of the three match series in which the Waratahs were undefeated. On the 1923 tour of New Zealand and aged just twenty, Sheehan was honoured with the captaincy of the Waratahs side in all three Tests. He also captained the side in four other tour matches. He then appeared at five-eighth in two Tests at home when the All Blacks toured in 1924. He was focused on his medical studies in 1925 but in 1926 returned to the national side for three Tests in 1926.\nHe was selected for the 1927–28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada though he traveled separately to the team as he was completing his medical exams. He played in the Tests against Wales and Scotland in the centres and playing in ten other tour matches in which on a number of occasions he took over as five-eighth from Tom Lawton.\nFollowing the tour the stayed in England for a period to further his medical studies before returning to Australia."

During the Second World War, Reading Cricket Club played several exhibition matches against London Counties and a British Empire XI. Berkshire first played Minor Counties Championship matches at the ground in 1948, playing Hertfordshire. Starting in 1952, the ground played host to one Minor Counties Championship match annually. The ground was the host venue for Berkshire's inaugural List A match against Somerset in the 1965 Gillette Cup. It held a further List A match for Berkshire in the 1966 Gillette Cup, with Gloucestershire as the visitors. Berkshire lost both these matches.\nA single first-class match was played at the ground in 1981 between a combined Minor Counties team and the touring Sri Lankans. The match ended in a draw, with Peter Johnson and Richard Lewis making half centuries for the Minor Counties, while Sidath Wettimuny and Yohan Goonasekera both passed the same landmark for the Sri Lankans. The ground hosted its third List A match two years later when Berkshire played Yorkshire in the 1983 NatWest Trophy, while two years it hosted its fourth List A match when a combined Minor Counties team played Hampshire in the 1985 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. Two years previous to that fixture, the ground held its forty-first and last Minor Counties Championship match when Berkshire played Cheshire.\nThe ground was sold for development shortly after 1985 with Reading Cricket Club having moved to Sonning Lane. The site of the ground is today occupied by residential housing including \"Barrington Close\", named after the Reading-born cricketer Ken Barrington."

        "text": "The region around Fontainebleau in France is particularly famous for its concentrated bouldering areas. French alpine climbers practiced bouldering there since the 19th century. It remains today a prime climbing location. It is the biggest and most developed bouldering area in the world, and is where the Fontainebleau grading system originated.\nHistory.\nAt the end of the 1800s, Aldolphe Joanne, the president of the Club Alpin Français, invited foreign visitors to visit the sites of Franchard and Apremont. In 1900, the Club Alpin Français organised a meet to ascend \"the Gorges d'Apremont range\" and then go to Larchant, whose huge rocks constitute the \"usual practicing area of the Paris Section of CAF.\"\nSeveral \"Bleau\" boulders or routes are named after famous climbers of the beginning of the 20th century: Prestat, Wehrlin, Maunoury, Gaché, Labour, Paillon, Souverain, and the famous Pierre Allain, the inventor of the smooth-sole climbing shoe (named \"P.A.\" from his initials). Before World War II, most of the areas that are popular today were already well known to Parisian climbers, except for Les Trois Pignons, which was not easily accessible by public transport.\nAt the time, people would climb in Fontainebleau primarily to train for mountain climbing. Thus, the 1936 French expedition to the Karakoram included several \"Bleausards\" (\"Bleau\" climbers). \"Bleausards\" Robert Paragot, Lucien Bérardini and René Ferlet made the first ascent of the South Face of Aconcagua in 1954.\nInitially, there were no formalised routes; climbers would choose the most remarkable boulders, aiming for the highest and most committing ones, as a preparation for the mountains.\nThe first guidebook appeared in 1945, written by Maurice Martin, providing a map of blocks and routes with their names and ratings. The first painted route was created in 1947 by Fred Bernick in the Cuvier Rempart area, followed by routes at Les Gorges d'Apremont painted by Pierre Mercier in 1952. The standardisation of route colour by difficulty (Yellow = PD, Orange = AD, Blue = D, Red = TD, Black = ED, White = ED+) dates back to the 1980s.\nIn 1984, French climber Jacky Godoffe established the first 8A in Fontainebleau when he climbed \"C'était demain\" at Cuvier Rempart.\nToday, most \"Bleau\" climbing areas are owned by the French state and managed by the Office National des Forêts, in cooperation with the local governments and with climbers' federations.\nGeography.\nThe Fontainebleau climbing areas are located in a forested area south of Paris. They are colloquially known as \"Font\" to English speakers, and as \"Bleau\" in France. They are located mostly within the \"Forêt Domaniale\" (National Forest) \"de Fontainebleau\", near the town of Fontainebleau, \"des Trois Pignons\" (near Milly-la-Forêt) and \"de la Commanderie\" (near Larchant).\nSome of the major areas are:\nAlthough at a farther distance, the climbing areas of Beauvais (Nainville-les-Roches, north of Milly), Nemours, Buthiers-Malesherbes (west of Larchant) and Chamarande are similar and are considered part of \"Bleau\".\nGeology.\nThe boulders in Fontainebleau are erosive remnants from the Oligocene age, relatively young in geological terms. Their appearance may have been accentuated by localised mineralisation (silicification) of the sandstone rock, forming large nodules.\nRoute grading and marking.\nTwo complementary grading systems are in use.\nThis is now widely used also in other bouldering areas around the world. However, the \"Bleau\" grades are generally more severe; thus an 8A route outside of \"Bleau\" is significantly easier than an 8A boulder problem in \"Bleau\".\nRoute paint marks.\nThe typical \"Bleau\" landscape is a \"chaos\" of rocks (no more than a few meters high) spread over a sandy plain.\nA climbing route threads its way from boulder to boulder.\nRoutes (\"circuits\" in French) are numbered within the restricted area (say, within Les Gorges d'Apremont).\nRoutes are colour-coded according to their adjectival grade:\nA small number of routes have retained their historical, non-standard colour, notably at Les Gorges d'Apremont (\"La bleue outremer\" = marine blue) and La Dame Jouanne (\"La mauve\" = purple). All the boulders used along a given route are marked the same colour. The difficulty of each individual move can be found in guidebooks.\nThe first rock of the route (\"le départ\") carries a white painted rectangle inscribed with the route number and its grading (e.g. AD+) in the appropriate colour (orange in this example). On each individual boulder, an arrow indicates the general direction of climb. Problem boulders are numbered in sequence (number 1 is typically the boulder after the \"départ\"); easier, transition boulders are marked with an unnumbered arrow. Alternative problems are marked with an arrow and a b (\"bis\") or a t (\"ter\"), or with a small triangle (\"variante\"). Where the same route crosses a boulder twice, the first arrow is marked A (\"aller\") and the second R (\"retour\"). The final boulder is marked with a circled A (\"arrivée\").\nThe body is positioned such that the arrow is at navel level. Generally, all holds within reasonable reach are allowed; occasionally, a forbidden hold may be indicated by a dashed line. A lone dot indicates a suggested foothold. A dot within a broken circle indicates a jump. A dot with a triangle indicates the general direction of the next boulder.\nSome routes, called \"parcours montagne\", intended to emulate a mountain route, are bi-directional and are indicated by a line rather than an arrow.\nVery few of these remain; there is one, for instance, at Franchard-Cuisinière."

On its eastern side, it is bordered by the Altmühl valley, on the western side by the Ries impact crater and Wörnitz valley. Two streams, Westliche Rohrach and Östliche Rochrach, run through the region with the first one supplying the artificial lake Hahnenkammsee. Highest point of the Hahnenkamm and the Franconian Jura as a whole is the Dürrenberg. The largest municipality is Treuchtlingen.\nGeology.\nAs for other parts of the Jura mountains, the Hahnenkamm mostly consists of Jurassic-aged sedimentary rocks, which were deposited in the former Tethys sea. Additionally, patchy deposits of ejecta named \"Bunte Trümmermassen\" (\"coloured breccia\") occur, originating from the proximate Ries impact. In several springs at the mountain slopes, tufa is precipitated, forming aqueduct-like channels called \"Steinerne Rinnen\" (\"lithic channels\"). Rarely occurring sedimentary quartzites are probably Cretaceous in age.\nTourism.\nThe lake Hahnenkammsee was officially dedicated in 1977, it is part of the Franconian Lake District. Proximate to the lake is a large area open to enduro motorcycles. Several medieval buildings and archeological sites of past fortifications can be found in the region.\nParts of the Hahnenkamm region are protected as nature reserve, geotopes or protected landscape.\nSee also.\nVerwaltungsgemeinschaft Hahnenkamm"

        "text": "Nancy Warren (June 13, 1921 – June 1, 2001) was a pitcher and infielder who played from through for six different teams of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at , 130 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. \"Hank\" was a nickname she picked up as a youth.\nEarly life.\nA native of Springfield, Ohio, Nancy Warren used to play baseball with her four brothers in their home's backyard at an early age. She joined her first organized fastpitch softball team after turning 14, juggling positions on the field as a pitcher and at shortstop. She later played softball for the Fink and Heine Packers team in a national tournament, where she were recruited by an AAGPBL scout. Warren was given a tryout during the 1946 spring training held at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and was allocated to the Muskegon Lassies as a shortstop.\nAAGPBL career.\n1946-1950 seasons.\nSince the Lassies already had an overloaded infield, Warren was benched most of the time. Halfway through the season she demanded an opportunity to play or be traded, and Muskegon manager Buzz Boyle gave her the opportunity to pitch and play at infield. Unfortunately, Warren broke an ankle in the process and lost the rest of the season. In April 1947, all of the league's players were flown to Havana, Cuba, for spring training. After that, the teams paired off and played exhibition games, traveling by train to their home cities. That exhibition schedule helped get the players ready for the opening of regular season games in the last week of May. New Muskegon manager Bill Wambsganss assumed he might use Warren in the pitching rotation. She did well, going 17–11 with 93 strikeouts and a 1.13 earned run average in 31 games.\nWarren started 1948 in good form, but was dealt to the expansion Chicago Colleens during the midseason. At the time the league shifted players in anytime as needed to help new teams stay afloat. She posted a combined 12–5 record for a .706 winning percentage while striking out 86 batters. Chicago had a horrendous record and folded at the end of the season. She found herself on the move again, this time to the Peoria Redwings the next year. \"Every time they wanted to booster a team, they'd transfer you\", Warren recalled in an interview. Nevertheless, she enjoyed to play in Peoria, even though she had negative numbers with the Redwings after leading the league in losses (16), runs allowed (92) and earned runs (64) in 1949. She rebounded in 1950, going 18–18 with 86 strikeouts and a 2.41 ERA in 32 pitching appearances with Peoria.\n1951-1953 seasons.\nDuring the 1951 midseason Warren was sent to the Fort Wayne Daisies. In her new team she had plenty of run support from her teammates, thanks to a lineup that included the explosive bats of Betty Foss, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Dorothy Schroeder and Joanne Weaver, which led to her best ever winning record of 17–6 (.739). In 1952, she went 17–7 with a 2.46 ERA and finished second in the league with 91 SO (23 behind leader Jean Faut). Unfortunately, Warren experienced her worst season in 1953 with a 6–17 record after being traded to the helpless Muskegon Belles.\n1954 season.\nWarren was traded to the Kalamazoo Lassies in 1954, during what turned out to be the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League's final season. For the second time, she inadvertently found herself in an inspired team. The Lassies, with Mitch Skupien at the helm, finished fourth of five teams with a 48-49-1 mark, earning a berth to the playoffs. In the first round, the team disposed of the South Bend Blue Sox (48-44 record) in three games and later faced Fort Wayne in the best-of-five series. During the regular season, Warren posted a 12–9 record with 63 strikeouts and a 3.86 ERA in 26 pitching appearances, ranking seventh in the league in strikeouts while tying teammate Gloria Cordes for the fourth-best in wins. For the first (and last) time of her career, Warren was selected for the All-Star Team. In the playoffs, Cordes hurled and lost the opener to South Bend, but Warren and Elaine Roth won games two and three, respectively.\nLast Championship Series.\nIn Game 1 of the AAGPBL Series, the Kalamazoo Lassies defeated the visiting Fort Wayne Daisies 17–9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from June Peppas, who also helped herself by hitting 2-for-4, including one home run. Her teammates Carol Habben and Fern Shollenberger also batted one each, and Chris Ballingall belted a grand slam. Warren relieved Peppas in the eight, forcing Jean Geissinger to hit into a double play, and preserved the victory. Pitching star Maxine Kline, who had posted an 18–7 record with 3.23 ERA for the Daisies during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss. Katie Horstman connected two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause, while her teammate Joanne Weaver slugged one.\nIn a seven-season career, Warren posted a mark of 114 wins with 93 losses and a 2.41 earned run average. She hit a career-average of .155 (104-for-66) and recorded a collective .939 career fielding percentage. In her final season, did not commit an error all year to lead all pitchers in the league with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage .In addition, she was one of seven pitchers to collect 100 or more wins in the circuit, ranking 6th on the all-time list behind Helen Nicol (163), Jean Faut (140), Joanne Winter (133), Dorothy Collins (117), Maxine Kline (116), and over Connie Wisniewski (107). As an added value, Warren joined a softball team who won the Michigan state championship in 1956. She also worked during 25 years for the North Central Airlines. After retiring in 1980, she was a long resident of Largo, Florida.\nNancy Warren is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, opened in , which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual player. She died in Southfield, Michigan, twelve days short of her 80th birthday."

The shortening was to allow for the Open Water races, which were the day following the Swimming competition, to move from Sunday, October 23, 2011, to Saturday, October 22 in Puerto Vallarta. As part of the formatting change, the men's 1500 free and women's 800 free were also moved from the last two days of the schedule to earlier in the program to distance them from the open water swim.\nQualifying.\nOn May 26, 2010, the qualification standards for the Swimming portion of the 2011 Pan Am Games were set.\nThe time standards for the 2011 Pan American Games were:"

        "title": "Johnny Lewis (boxing trainer)",
        "text": "John Alfred “Johnny” Lewis OAM (born 18 March 1944) is an Australian boxing trainer and the head coach of six world champions, most notably Jeff Fenech, Jeff Harding, Gairy St. Clair and Kostya Tszyu.\nLewis’ career spans from training amateur boxers on the local Sydney circuit to working with Australian boxing champions and rugby league international representatives. The philosophies and coaching career of Lewis merited him many accolades including an Order of Australia medal and an induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, both of which were achieved in 2006. Due to these accolades, Johnny Lewis has been asserted as one of Australia's most acclaimed boxing coaches.\nEarly life.\nJohnny Lewis was born on 18 March 1944 at Bankstown hospital to father Alfred and mother Marge. His family lived in Wallangarra at the time, before moving into a housing commission flat in Erskineville, in Sydney's inner-west.\nLewis' first employment was selling papers at Football games as well as working the scoreboard at Erskineville Oval for local first-grade Australian Rules matches, where he would listen to coaches’ team talks. Lewis played Australian Rules Football and Tennis throughout his teenage years. An athletic career for Lewis was cut short at age 19 as he sustained an ankle injury after falling off a ladder whilst sign writing.\nIn 1957, a thirteen-year-old Lewis began training under coaches Snowy MacFadyen and Jack Blom at the Newtown Police Boys Club, travelling to Cowra, Orange, Griffith and Singleton in regional New South Wales for amateur boxing competitions. As a physically disadvantaged boxer Lewis trained under Dick O’Connor until he was 17, without losing a fight under his guidance. Lewis models much of his coaching style on O’Connor's.\nAmateur coaching career.\nLewis’ introduction to coaching came by coincidence - at age 17 as his coach Ken Shorter, assigned Johnny to corner six amateur boxers at a tournament in Parramatta, all of which won their respective bouts. In 1961 Johnny took over the Newtown PCYC boxing club as its head trainer. A year later Snowy McFaden would re-enter the gym, training alongside Lewis for 3 years.\nIn 1966 Lewis moved to the Botany Street gym in partnership with Mick Fernandez, where Fernandez would train professional fighters and Lewis would train the amateur fighters.\nFernandez taught Lewis how to wrap hands and clean cuts. Later Lewis would incorporate Fernandez into Snowy Robbin's gym in Erskineville.\nIn 1978, Phil McElwaine won a gold medal in the middleweight division at the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada with Lewis in his corner.\nIn November 1988, Lewis was appointed head trainer for the Australian Amateur Boxing Team for the Seoul Olympics.\nYoung Offenders Program.\nIn January 1986, Lewis took several of his fighters including Jeff Fenech to Parklea Prison to spar inmates in makeshift rings, the point of which was to demonstrate the outcomes of poor behaviour for his fighters and an appropriate outlet of aggression for the prisoners.\nBrian Moore started the Young Offenders Program in the Newtown Police Boys Club. Lewis would join this partnership by continuing to take boxers to prisons across New South Wales. As the program developed it became more theoretical, boxers would spar less and instead hand out Big League Magazines and videos of boxing matches.\nProfessional coaching career.\nSummary.\nThe professional career of Lewis catalysed due to the rapid rise of Jeff Fenech. This in turn caused Jeff Harding to relocate from Grafton to train under him and Russian World Amateur Champion Kostya Tszyu to turn professional under Lewis’ tutelage. These accreditations prompted several fighters to also be trained by Lewis.\nFighters Trained.\nVirgil Hill.\nAmerican Virgil Hill moved to Australia to train at Newtown in an attempt to regain his world light-heavyweight title. In 1992 was Hill's third fight under Lewis, in which he won a unanimous decision against Frank Tate to gain the vacant WBA light heavyweight title. This was a short-term partnership however as Hill returned to the United States after the victory.\nJoe Bugner.\nIn 1986, Joe Bugner came out of retirement for one last campaign, aiming to fight heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. In moving to Australia, Bugner went on a three-fight win streak before stopped in the eighth round by Frank Bruno. Bugner had domestic success after his partnership with Lewis, winning the Australian Heavyweight title.\nAt the peak of Bugner's comeback, he won a unanimous decision against Greg Page in Sydney. On this card, Johnny Lewis had Jeff Harding finish Johnny Tapau Sr in the second round and Peter Mitrevski winning a decision over Charlie Brown.\nJustin Rowsell.\nFollowing the 1992 Olympics, Justin Roswell, a promising Australian amateur turned professional under Lewis, winning the WBO intercontinental lightweight championship. Rowsell had a more acclaimed amateur career however, with a bronze medal at the 1991 Amateur Boxing World Championships, a gold medal at the Canada Cup and a Commonwealth games silver medal.\nGairy St. Clair.\nIn his training with Lewis, Gairy St. Clair won the International Boxing Federation and International Boxing Organization World Super Featherweight Title in South Africa, winning a unanimous decision 116–112, 115–113, 115–114 over Cassius Baloyi. Lewis regarded St Clair as not only one of the best movers he'd trained but seen.\nBilly Dib.\nBilly Dib would win his first world title, the IBO Super-featherweight championship in 2008 against Zolani Marali after switching trainers to have Lewis in his corner. Whilst a brief training partnership, Dib became Johnny Lewis’ sixth World Title holder.\nJeff Malcolm.\nJeff Malcolm was managed by New South Wales Blues and Australian Kangaroos Rugby League representative Tommy Raudonikis whilst being trained by Johnny Lewis. Lewis trained Malcolm for sixteen years, holding the Australian Super Lightweight Title before relocating to the United States in the quest for a world title.\nPeter Mitrevski.\nPeter Mitrevski won the vacant Australian flyweight title against Charlie Brown in 1988 under the training of Lewis. Lewis stated Mitrevski may not go any further in the sport of boxing, suggesting his retirement. Mitrevski was upset by this statement however stayed with Lewis due to his friendship with Jeff Fenech.\nPaul Briggs.\nPaul Briggs asked Lewis to take over his training after a majority decision loss to Tomasz Adamek for the WBC Light Heavyweight title. After the training of Lewis, Briggs got his rematch against Adamek, only to lose again via majority decision. After this loss, Lewis began to reduce training fighters, giving time to his family.\nJeff Fenech.\nLewis met Jeff Fenech in 1981, when Fenech came in to the Newtown boxing gym for Rugby League fitness. Fenech was cornered by Lewis since his professional debut at Blacktown Police Boys Club, with a win over Craig Easey. Lewis was unimpressed by Fenech's fighting style in the early years and tried to implement discipline in Fenech's life in and out of the ring. By this time, Lewis was 37 years-old and had over 20 years of experience training boxers. After winning a bronze medal at the 1983 Rome World Cup and captaining the Australian amateur team in the 1984 Olympics Fenech would turn professional under Lewis the following year. Fenech stopped Junior Thompson in the fourth round to win the Australian super-fliyweight title in his third fight. With struggles to cut down to the 115-pound junior bantamweight division, Lewis moved Fenech up to bantamweight. Lewis aimed to match Fenech up against different styles to concentrate on one aspect of the sport at a time. This was evidenced by Fenech's matchup against Rolly Navarro, a southpaw. Despite dominating the fight, Lewis ordered Fenech to keep the fight going for his experience.\nFenech vs Shingaki.\nAfter only 7 consecutive wins to start his career Fenech would win the IBF World bantamweight title against Satoshi Shingaki. Johnny Lewis and manager Bill Mordey accepted a rematch with Shingaki in order to stall top contender Jerome Coffee and give Fenench more experience. In the rematch Fenech broke Shingaki's nose in the first round before stopping him in the third.\nIBF Title Defences.\nJeff Fenech went 15 rounds with American contender Jerome Coffee before being awarded a unanimous decision victory, 148–140, 146–141 and 145–140. After the title defence, Lewis would have Fenech train under shadow boxing conditions due to broken hand injuries.\nFenech would defend the IBF title against Steve McCrory, despite being dominated in the latter rounds, almost forcing Lewis to throw the towel in.\nFenech vs Payakaroon.\nFenech would knock out Samart Payakaroon in the fourth round to win the WBC Super bantamweight title.\nWBC Title Defences.\nFenech earned a technical decision victory over Carlos Zarate after a cut was patched up by Lewis in between rounds.\nLewis notoriously demoralised opponents by picking up his fighter and pushing him toward the centre of the ring before the beginning of each round. Lewis would do this in Fenech's career against Victor Callejas earning him a victory and Azumah Nelson for a split decision draw.\nFenech would lose a rematch against Nelson, Lewis would only not retire his fighter as he felt he deserved a better ending.\nLewis led Fenech to three world titles at bantamweight, featherweight and super featherweight respectively.\nJeff Harding.\nJeff Harding was introduced to Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Lewis moved Harding up to Light Heavyweight permanently after his New South Wales Cruiserweight title victory in 1988.\nIn his first fight outside Australia Harding defeated Dennis Andries, trained by Hall of Fame trainer Emmanuel Steward solidifying Lewis amongst the elite boxing trainers. Before the final round, it was revealed that Lewis said “go out one more time and come back world champion.”\nKostya Tszyu.\nIn coaching the Australian amateur team at the World Championships in Moscow, Lewis met Russian Lightweight Kostya Tszyu. Tszyu would move to Australia permanently to train under Lewis and after an impressive knockout streak that would move him up the professional ranks toward light-welterweight contention.\nTszyu would capture the IBF light-welterweight title in January 1995 against Jake Rodriguez. In 2001, Tszyu would defeat Zab Judah to become the WBC, WBA and IBF champion. Revealed in his biography by Paul Kent, Lewis would feel a rift with Tszyu after allegedly being underpaid. Further revelations involved the attempts of Lewis to depart as head coach, feeling as if he was not needed in the Tszyu camp.\nPhilosophies.\nLewis would tape a white cross on each of his fighter's wrists, one for him and one for his opponent so they may be watched over during the fight. He would say “we want them all to go down, but we want them all to get up after the count of ten.”\nIn his early 20s Lewis journeyed to Thailand and witness the fighters hitting target pads. After noticing the difference in speed that Thai boxers possessed, he would implement pads into his gym at Newtown. Target pads were seen in all boxing gyms in Australia since then, formerly coaches used larger gloves as the target.\nLewis would say “I love you” to all his fighters, sending them out for the next round – revealed in his biography that he was looking for “trust”. Further corner work would involve Lewis pushing his fighter to the middle of the ring before the round began to exhibit a quick recovery and high work rate to demoralise the opponent.\nLewis used a personal solution with a Friars' balsam base to stop cuts and peppermint oil for fighters to sniff before and during the fight for breathing purposes.\nLewis highlighted the importance of high intensity training, likening it to a marathon as it would be easier if run in stages.\nHonours.\nIn December 1989, Johnny Lewis was named Coach of the Year at the Sport Australia Awards. At the time, Lewis had two concurrent champions in his gym and held a record of 13–0 in title fights.\nIn 2006, Lewis was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia and inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame.\nRugby league.\nLewis had been on the Newtown Jets Rugby League Club committee since 1973, when Jack Gibson was appointed coach. Newtown's captain, Tommy Raudonikis trained with Lewis for extra fitness sessions.\nIn 1989, through rugby league international player, coach and personal friend Bob Fulton, Lewis became a trainer of the Australian Kangaroos 1990 Tour of Great Britain and France.\nPersonal life.\nLewis has lived in Erskineville his whole life, working as a signwriter for the Sydney County Council for majority of it, whilst simultaneously training fighters. Lewis has four children, Brent, Leisa, Jackson and Johnnie Jr.\nLewis operated the Newtown Police Boys Club Boxing gym alongside childhood friend and Newtown Jets centre, Brian Moore.\nIn April 1999, a hailstorm caused damage to the roof of the Newtown Police Boys Club with repairs costing an approximate one million dollars, the Inner West Council put the building up for sale. At age 61, the gym closure forced Lewis to train fighters at PCYC institutes in Woolloomooloo, South Sydney and Marrickville as well as the HK Ward University of Sydney boxing gym."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of John A. Logan",
        "text": "Major General John A. Logan, also known as the General John A. Logan Monument and Logan Circle Monument, is an equestrian statue in Washington, D.C., that honors politician and Civil War general John A. Logan. The monument is sited in the center of Logan Circle, a traffic circle and public park in the Logan Circle neighborhood. The statue was sculpted by artist Franklin Simmons, whose other prominent works include the Peace Monument and statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. The architect of the statue base was Richard Morris Hunt, designer of prominent buildings including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island. Prominent attendees at the dedication ceremony in 1901 included President William McKinley, members of his cabinet, Senator Chauncey Depew, Senator Shelby Moore Cullom, and General Grenville M. Dodge.\nThe sculpture is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The bronze sculpture rests on a bronze and granite base adorned with two reliefs depicting historically inaccurate moments in Logan's life. The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nJohn A. Logan (1826–1886) was a native of Illinois who served as a second lieutenant in the Mexican–American War before studying at the University of Louisville to become a lawyer. Originally a member of the Democratic Party, he was elected state senator and later a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. During the onset of the Civil War, Logan denounced what he considered extremists on both sides, but eventually volunteered to fight with the Union Army during the First Battle of Bull Run. He then resigned from Congress and was made colonel after he organized the 31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Logan was wounded twice while serving in the war and considered an outstanding field commander. He was promoted to brigadier general following the victory at Fort Donelson. Logan played a significant role in the Union success at Vicksburg and served as that district's military governor. Following the death of General James B. McPherson, Logan was given command of the Army of the Tennessee, but was soon relieved by General Oliver O. Howard after Logan became too involved with the 1864 presidential election. He left the army in 1865 and resumed his career in politics.\nLogan was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives and later to the U.S. Senate. In the 1884 presidential election, Logan unsuccessfully ran with Senator James G. Blaine as his vice presidential candidate, narrowly losing the race. During his time in office, Logan was considered one of the most vocal advocates for military veterans. He helped organize two veteran fraternal organizations, the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) and the Society of the Army of the Tennessee (SAT), and was instrumental in the federal government recognizing Memorial Day (originally called Decoration Day) as an official holiday, first celebrated in 1868.\nSoon after Logan's death in 1886, the SAT began work on erecting a monument to the military hero. The organization worked closely with the GAR and Logan's widow, Mary, to raise funds and lobby Congress for a monument. It would be the second equestrian monument in Washington, D.C., commissioned by the SAT, the first being the \"Major General James B. McPherson\" statue. Erection of the monument was approved by an act of Congress on March 2, 1889. A memorial commission was created to select a sculptor and site for the statue. Members of the commission asked sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens who he would recommend. He suggested Franklin Simmons (1839–1913), an American artist working in Rome. Simmons had previously sculpted several Civil War monuments, including the Peace Monument in Washington, D.C. His other works in the city include several statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection and the United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection.\nThe commission considered models by several sculptors before selecting Simmons in December 1892, whose model was the \"most agreeable to Mrs. Logan.\" She admired not only the posture of Simmon's model, but his idea to have the statue rest on a bronze base, unlike other monuments in the city that featured granite bases. Mary also liked that Simmons and members of the commission would follow her recommendations for the reliefs to be found on the statue base. Simmons was paid $65,000 for his work; around $13,000 from the SAT and the remainder from the federal government. Sculpting the piece proved more difficult than Simmons had expected since the Logan statue was his first and only equestrian work. He was forced to ask for several extensions beginning in 1896. Simmons paid founder Fonderia Nelli extra money to work around the clock on the base, designed by prominent architect Richard Morris Hunt, whose other works include the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and The Breakers in Newport Rhode Island.\nIt only took Nelli three-and-a-half months to complete the process instead of the planned year. The Cranford Paving Company was contracted to prepare the site and lay the granite foundation. Simmons was not pleased with the company's work and new stone was ordered in September 1897. Following the new stone's placement, the base was installed on April 18, 1898. It wasn't until 1900 that Simmons completed the sculpture and it was cast in Rome. Upon its completion, a ceremony attended by King Umberto I of Italy and his wife, Queen Margherita, was held at the foundry where Simmons was honored with knighthood. The sculpture was shipped to the United States and arrived in Brooklyn in December 1900. Because the sculpture was too large to be transported by train, it was placed onto a two-masted schooner and arrived in Washington, D.C., on January 16, 1901. It was installed on top of the base one week later.\nThe site chosen for the monument was the center of Iowa Circle, a park in an upscale neighborhood in the city's northwest quadrant. The park was completely redesigned in 1891 to make room for the monument. By the time it was dedicated in 1901, nearby Dupont Circle was lined with mansions and had become more popular with the city's wealthy residents while Iowa Circle, surrounded by stately row houses, had become a middle-class neighborhood.\nDedication.\nThe monument was formally dedicated on April 9, 1901. Temporary platforms for invited and distinguished guests were built near the base. Guests included President William McKinley, members of his cabinet, Senator Chauncey Depew, Senator Shelby Moore Cullom, General Grenville M. Dodge, Mary Logan and several members of the Logan family, representatives from the GAR and SAT, and Simmons. Prior to the ceremony, there was a large military parade led by Colonel Francis L. Guenther. The parade consisted of soldiers, marines, seamen from the nearby Navy Yard, the District of Columbia militia, and GAR and SAT veterans. Dodge, who was president of the SAT and the only living general depicted on one of the relief panels, presided over the ceremonies. George Tucker, a grandson of Logan, pulled a cord, parting the flags that had draped over the statue. This was followed by cheers and applause from the crowd while the Fourth Artillery fired a national salute.\nMcKinley, the last Civil War veteran to occupy the White House, gave an address which included the following remarks: \"It is a good token when patriots are honored and patriotism exalted. Monuments which express the nation's gratitude for great deeds inspire great deeds. The statue unveiled today proclaims our country's appreciation of one of her heroic sons whose name is dear to the American people, the ideal volunteer soldier of two wars, the eminent senator and commoner, General John A. Logan.\" Following the president's speech, Depew also gave an address. His remarks included: \"The history of our country is condensed in the Revolutionary and civil wars. As Washington stands out in the first of our crucial contests, so does Lincoln in the second. About Lincoln cluster Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Logan, McPherson, and a host of other heroes...Among those successful Americans in many lines who have won and held the public eye and died mourned by all their countrymen, there will live in the future in the history of the Republic no nobler figure, in peace and in war, in the pursuits of the citizen, and in work for the welfare of his fellow citizens, than General John A. Logan.\" Cullom then read a letter from Illinois governor Richard Yates Jr., who was unable to attend, which paid tribute to Logan and noted how proud the state's citizens were of the Illinois native. The ceremony concluded following the benediction by Reverence J. G. Butler.\nReception.\nInitial reception to the statue was very positive. \"The New York Times\" described it as producing \"an impression of dignity, beauty, and power.\" But in the weeks following the dedication ceremony, praise turned to criticism and reporters noted \"absurdities\" in the relief panels. They noted that the relief depicting Logan gathered with other Civil War leaders plotting strategy together was very unlikely. The second panel, depicting Logan being sworn in as senator by Vice President Chester A. Arthur was called \"impossible\" and \"ridiculous.\" Logan was sworn into the Senate in 1879 and Arthur himself was not sworn in as vice president until 1881. Two of the senators depicted in that relief were not sworn in until 1882 and 1884, respectively, and another one died in 1877. Mary Logan initially took credit for selecting the scenes depicted in the reliefs and received all of the blame when the errors were discovered. In a heated letter to the \"Evening Star\", she said the reliefs were not meant to be historically accurate: \"Of course, we knew all this, but we disregarded it because we wanted these panels to portray the most prominent men of the history of the country who were in the Senate during the 16 years that my husband was Senator.\" She added to reproduce historically accurate scenes would have been \"absurd.\"\nLater history.\nIn 1930, Congress renamed Iowa Circle in honor of Logan, who had briefly lived at 4 Logan Circle in 1885. The statue is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C., that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979. It is also designated a contributing property to the Logan Circle Historic District, listed on the NRHP on June 30, 1972, and the Fourteenth Street Historic District, listed on the NRHP on November 9, 1994. The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nDesign and location.\nThe monument is sited in the center of Logan Circle, a 1.8 acre (0.73 ha) public park and traffic circle in the Logan Circle neighborhood at the convergence of 13th Street, P Street, Rhode Island Avenue and Vermont Avenue NW. Sidewalks lead from the edge of the circle to the monument on axis with the surrounding streets. Around twenty oak trees are planted throughout the circle and a small, ornamental iron fence surrounds the statue base.\nThe bronze equestrian statue measures tall, long, and wide. It weighs approximately . Logan is depicted with collar-length hair and a moustache, wearing his Civil War military uniform; a long belted jacket, boots, gloves, and a hat. He holds the horse's reins with his left hand and his right hand holds his sword, pointed downward. The horse is striding forward, with its right foot raised. The inscriptions \"FOND. NELLI ROMA 1897\" and \"FRANKLIN SIMMONS\" are found on the statue.\nThe statue rests on a rectangular bronze base which is itself on top of a low granite base. The base is high, long, and wide. It weighs approximately . A bald eagle symbolizing Patriotism adorns the upper section of each corner of the bronze base. Around the inscription \"LOGAN\" are palm leaves symbolizing Victory. These are located on the east and west sides of the lower portion of the bronze base. The relief on the west side of the base depicts Logan surrounded by fellow officers discussing the Civil War. The officers include Generals Francis Preston Blair, Jr., Dodge, William Babcock Hazen, Mortimer Dormer Leggett, Joseph A. Mower, and Henry Warner Slocum, and Captain Bill Strong. On Logan's proper right is a map spread on a table with three of the officers studying it. The remaining officers are looking towards Logan who has his left hand resting on the map. The relief on the east side of the base depicts Logan being sworn into office as a senator by Vice President Arthur. Logan's right arm is raised while Arthur's left hand is raised and holding a book. Other senators depicted in the relief include Roscoe Conkling, Cullom, William M. Evarts, John F. Miller, Oliver P. Morton, Allen G. Thurman, and Daniel W. Voorhees. A female allegorical figure is on the north and south sides of the base. The figure on the north side, representing Peace or Victory, is holding a laurel wreath in her right hand and a fasces in her left hand. She is wearing long robes and has a laurel wreath on her head. The figure on the south side, representing War, is holding a shield with her left hand and a sword with her right hand. She is wearing a dress adorned with armor details and a crown-shaped helmet."

        "text": "Club Athlétique de Saint-Étienne Loire Sud Rugby, CASE Loire Sud Rugby, or simply CASE, is a French rugby union club from Saint-Étienne in the Loire \"département\". As of 2011, they were competing in Fédérale 1, having been relegated from Rugby Pro D2 at the end of the 2010–11 season.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1908 under the name \"Stade Forézien Universitaire\". They went through a difficult time in the 1960s, and had to merge with the CASE omnisport structure in 1975 at the request of the municipality. It did not help turn back the tide, however, and poor results and fewer and fewer licensed players forced the club to withdraw its senior team from all competitions in 1991. The next year, the club was restarted in 4ème Série, the lowest French rugby division, and was able to climb the ladder, gaining promotion to Fédérale 3 in 2004, one year after merging with the neighbouring club SEMUR and adopting its current name. In 2007, Saint-Etienne were promoted to Fédérale 2. A mere two years later, they finished 13th overall in the championship, with the top 12 clubs being promoted to Fédérale 1. However, Lombez-Samatan declined their promotion, sending Saint-Étienne to the top amateur division for the first time.\nFor their first season in Fédérale 1, Saint-Étienne signed the coach Jean-Sébastien Bignat from Arras, and the international fullback Alexandre Péclier from Lyon. They had an impressive start with two away wins in their first two games, and on November 7, they took on Béziers in Andrézieux-Bouthéon's Stade Roger-Baudras. The 3,000 people in the stadium were not the only ones to witness the locals' 15–9 victory though, as the match was broadcast live on Eurosport, a first for a Fédérale 1 game. This run of good form allowed them to clinch the fourth place in their group and thus to qualify for the Trophée Jean Prat. In the second phase, they finished second behind Tyrosse and qualified for the Round of 16 where they faced Nice. They prevailed 19–18 thanks to a last-second drop-goal by Péclier and faced Chalon-sur-Saône, one of the favorites for promotion, in the quarters. Saint-Étienne stunned them by winning both legs (12–3 at home, 24–20 away), inflicting them their only home defeat of the season in the process. In the semis, they took on Bourg-en-Bresse. The popular support for the team was such that the municipality allowed the first leg to be played in Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Over 16,000 people came to see the locals take the slenderest of leads into the second leg with a 23–22 victory. Another shock 19–16 win in Bourg-en-Bresse sent Saint-Étienne in the Jean Prat Trophy final, but much more importantly gave them a ticket to professional rugby and the Pro D2, after only one year spent in Fédérale 1, and perhaps more impressively only three years after leaving Fédérale 3. They fell in the final to Carcassonne 16–3."

        "text": "The Alaska Anchorage Seawolves men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of Alaska Anchorage. The Seawolves were an original member of the now defunct men's division in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). They played at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, Alaska, and moved to the Seawolf Sports Complex on campus at the start of the 2019–20 season.\nHistory.\nUAA began its ice hockey program in 1979, playing 8 of its 31 games against Division II Alaska–Fairbanks (winning all) before beginning a full D-II schedule the following season. The Seawolves rose quickly in the Division II ranks, narrowly missing out on the NCAA tournament in 1984 but promoted the team to Division I that summer when the entire D-II division collapsed.\nAnchorage played as an independent for a year before being a founding member of the first west coast conference, the Great West Hockey Conference. The league was very short-lived, lasting only three seasons before the two non-Alaska schools dropped hockey entirely, but it did provide UAA with its first league title in 1987. The Seawolves were once again without a conference in 1988–89, but a year later they posted their first 20-win season at the D-I level and were selected to the NCAA Tournament.\nThe Seawolves dropped both games to Lake Superior State but returned the following year after another 20-win campaign and this time they were able to win their first NCAA round, defeating the Boston College Eagles. 1991–92 provided UAA with its best record, with the team going 27–8–1 and garnering a third consecutive NCAA berth (the last such for UAA as of 2019). After one more winning season the Seawolves joined the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.\nThe stability of their new conference came as a double-edged sword, however, as the Seawolves would spend the next 20 years finishing with losing records. To make matters worse the team would lose both games in the opening round of the WCHA tournament most of the time and only twice could manage a First Round series win.\nThe college hockey world changed in 2013 when the Central Collegiate Hockey Association collapsed due to the formation of the Big Ten and the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. This caused the WCHA to replace many of its departing members with weaker teams but even in the new WCHA UAA was still a bottom-half team. After making the conference semifinals the first season the Seawolves missed the playoffs each of the next five years.\nIn 2020, the university announced plans to cut the hockey program, along with skiing and gymnastics, due to sharp reductions in state funding. The University of Alaska Board of Regents offered the hockey team a chance at reinstatement in September if they could raise 2 seasons worth of expenses, approximately $3 million by February 2021, so the hockey program as a whole went on hiatus and did not compete for both the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons as its future was being determined. The fundraising was divided into 2 parts: $1.5 million in cash and the remainder in firm pledges. As of December 2020, the team began fundraising for the needed money. On August 31, 2021, the university announced that enough donations had been received to save the program. The team returned to the ice for the 2022–23 season.\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Alaska Anchorage alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nSeawolves in the NHL.\nSource:"

They suggested that the new league would be named the Eastern European Professional Basketball League.\nIn July 2012, the Council of VTB United League gave a definitive decision. It was decided that the PBL league would continue for one more year, with some of the games of the VTB United League that took place between two Russian clubs being counted as PBL games.

This was the first time the West Indies toured Sri Lanka, which hosted the first ever Test match between the two countries. A three-day tour match between West Indies and Sri Lanka Board President's XI was also played at the Galle International Stadium from 3–5 December.\nThe tour was disrupted by bad weather, only one of its five fixtures ran its full course. The Test match had less than 12 hours of play. The only other first-class match, at Galle, was even more abbreviated. Rain prevented a finish to the first one-day international and the third was turned into a 23-over match.\nThe tour was first projected to be a three-Test series. It was rearranged and shortened to accommodate the Hero Cup, a limited-overs competition in India in which both teams took part.\nTest match.\nThis tour marked the first time the West Indies toured Sri Lanka for a full series, which included the very first Test match played between the two teams. Unfortunately the low scoring match was disrupted by the dreadful weather which only allowed for 11 hours' of play, and was very poorly attended. There was no play on day one and no balls were bowled on days four and five.\nSri Lanka won the toss and batted first, scoring 190 in under 100 overs with only a single half century in the innings by de Silva. The pitch was turning while the West Indies, for the first time in five years, played two front-line spinners, Harper joining Hooper. At Ranatunga's wicket, Sri Lanka were 130 for six. The seventh-wicket stand between Kalpage and wicket-keeper Dassanayake showed some defence however Ambrose effortlessly demolished the tail end\nThe West Indian innings were hardly as successful. The Sri Lankan spinners shared all ten wickets, Muralitharan claiming four of them. Losing four for 84, the fifth-wicket partnership between Richardson and Hooper gave the West Indies the lead. With the loss of that partnership the last six wickets went down for 36 runs. The match was drawn after 22 overs into Sri Lanka's second innings.\nODI series.\nThree ODIs were played, one before and two after the Test match.\n1st ODI.\nOvernight rain reduced the game to 39 overs a side, the game was further disrupted and prematurely finished due to the dark clouds and furious thunderstorms. Both teams found it hard to score runs on the slow pitch, however Lara's drives and clips off the legs raced to the boundary despite an extremely heavy outfield; he hit eight fours in 118 balls. Scoring only 16 runs in the first ten overs of Ambrose and Walsh, as well as losing the wicket of De Silva and Jayasuriya forced to retire with cramps, the Sri Lanka batsmen readily accepted the light when offered after an indiscreet bouncer from Kenny Benjamin.\n2nd ODI.\nAfter 18 limited-overs matches against the West Indies, Sri Lanka pulled off only their second win, with five balls to spare. Opening the batting, Haynes and Lara made a rollicking start with 128 from 26 overs, but were later bogged down by the spinners. After a thrill less innings, Sri Lanka entered the last nine overs needing 50 runs. The captain, Ranatunga, put Sri Lanka back on track attacking Ambrose for 12 runs in the penultimate over, levelling the scores and winning the match for the team. The West Indies gave away 18 wides finding bowling under the floodlights troublesome.\n3rd ODI.\nHeavy rain reduced the final match to a 23 overs a side game. Walsh exploited the sweating pitch, which offered ample movement, to capture the first three wickets, crippling the Sri Lankan batting even though De Silva batted sensibly. The cruising West Indians were pressured by the spinners and the required run rate rose to 35 in five overs. However, Arthurton's gigantic six over extra cover eased the pressure and put West Indies on course for victory."

Australia won the toss and invited the West Indies to bat, hoping to make use of ideal bowling conditions. The first moment of drama came when opener Roy Fredericks was dismissed hit wicket; he hooked a bouncer from Dennis Lillee for six, but in his follow-through lost his balance and knocked the bails off the stumps. Australia were on top at 50/3 when West Indian captain Clive Lloyd came to the crease in partnership with veteran Rohan Kanhai. The pair swung the match in the West Indies' favour by putting on 149 for the fourth wicket. Kanhai played the anchor role – not scoring for 11 overs – while Lloyd took on the Australian bowling attack, surviving a dropped catch on 26 to score a memorable century off 82 balls with 12 fours and 2 sixes and was dismissed shortly afterwards for 102. Kanhai, in what would be his farewell from international cricket, scored an invaluable 55, and solid contributions from Keith Boyce and Bernard Julien helped the West Indies close their innings at 291/8. Burly left-arm seamer Gary Gilmour was the pick of the Australian bowlers with 5/48, backing up his amazing semi-final performance.\nThe Australian run chase began steadily enough; at the 20-over mark, the Aussies were at 80/1 with Alan Turner and captain Ian Chappell taking advantage of an easy pitch and fast outfield. Then Viv Richards, who had failed with the bat, left his mark on the match with the next three run-outs. First he swooped in and dismissed Turner with a direct hit from close range, then Greg Chappell was also out with a direct hit after a slight misfield. Doug Walters came in and helped his captain steady the ship. Australia were at 162/3 with 21 overs remaining when Chappell, facing his opposing captain, pushed a ball to the left of mid-wicket and started off for a run. He hesitated initially when he saw Richards approaching, but started off again after Richards fumbled the ball, only to be caught short of the crease by Richards' lightning recovery and return to Lloyd at the bowler's end. In each situation, the batsmen probably would have made the run had they not hesitated. When Lillee joined Jeff Thomson as last man in, Australia required 59 runs to win off seven overs. The duo kept the game alive, putting on an unlikely last-wicket stand. With three overs remaining, the game reached an unlikely climax when Lillee hit a no-ball to Fredericks at extra cover off Vanburn Holder, and the crowd rushed onto the field oblivious to the umpire's call. Amid the chaos, Fredericks attempted a run-out but missed and the ball disappeared into the crowd. Lillee and Thomson kept running between the wickets until the crowd were dispersed. When play was resumed, the umpires decided to give Australia two runs. After protest from Thomson, they awarded three runs.\nComplete Scorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1-12 (Fredericks), 2-27 (Kallicharran), 3-50 (Greenidge), 4-199 (Lloyd), 5-206 (Kanhai), 6-209 (Richards), 7-261 (Boyce), 8-285 (Murray)\nFall of wickets: 1-25 (McCosker), 2-81 (Turner), 3-115 (GS Chappell), 4-162 (IM Chappell), 5-170 (Walters), 6-195 (Marsh), 7-221 (Gilmour), 8-231 (Edwards), 9-233 (Walker), 10-274 (Thomson)"

The match was won by the West Indies when they defeated England by 92 runs to lift the trophy.\nBackground.\nThe match was the second consecutive World Cup final hosted at Lord's, following the inaugural 1975 final.\nWest Indies reached a second consecutive final after defeating Pakistan by 43 runs in the semi-final. Previously, they had won the 1975 final.\nEngland was making their first appearance at a World Cup final after defeating New Zealand by 9 runs in the semi-finals. This was also the first appearance by a European nation at a World Cup final.\nBob Willis, England's leading bowler, missed the final after being injured in the semi-final.\nMatch report.\nEngland won the toss and chose to field first. The West Indies got off to a bad start, falling to 99/4 with the loss of Greenidge, Haynes, Kallicharan, and captain Clive Lloyd. However, Vivian Richards (138 from 157 balls, 11 fours, 3 sixes) and Collis King (86 from 66 balls, 10 fours, 3 sixes) consolidated the innings. King especially ripped through the English bowling, with a strike rate of 130.3. The West Indies were already at 5/238 when the 139 run partnership ended with the loss of Collis King. Vivian Richards and the tail then took the West Indies to a very imposing total of 286 (9 wickets, 60 overs).\nThe English batsmen got off to a good start. But the openers, Mike Brearley (64 from 130 balls, 7 fours) and Geoff Boycott (57 from 105 balls, 3 fours) scored very slowly. They put together a very methodical opening partnership of 129 runs in 38 overs, playing as if the match were a five-day Test. By the time both batsmen were out, the run rate had risen too high. Graham Gooch played some hefty strokes in scoring his 32, taking England to 183/2. However, the loss of Derek Randall triggered the most devastating collapse in World Cup history, as England lost 8 wickets for 11 runs. They were eventually all out for 194 in 51 overs.\nVivian Richards was declared Man of the Match.\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1-22 (Greenidge), 2-36 (Haynes), 3-55 (Kallicharran), 4-99 (Lloyd), 5-238 (King), 6-252 (Murray), 7-258 (Roberts), 8-260 (Garner), 9-272 (Holding)\nFall of wickets: 1-129 (Brearley), 2-135 (Boycott), 3-183 (Randall), 4-183 (Gooch), 5-186 (Gower), 6-186 (Larkins), 7-192 (Botham), 8-192 (Old), 9-194 (Taylor), 10-194 (Hendrick)"

        "text": "The final of the 1983 Cricket World Cup was played between India and the West Indies at Lord's on 25 June 1983. This was the third consecutive World Cup final appearance for the West Indies, having won the last two Cricket World Cups. India, playing in their first final, defeated the West Indies to claim their first World Cup title.\nBackground.\nThe match was the third consecutive World Cup final hosted at Lord's, following those in 1975 and 1979. India was making their first appearance at a World Cup final after defeating England by 6 wickets in the first semi-finals. This was also the first appearance by an Asian nation in a World Cup final. In fact, in the prior two world cups in 1975 and 1979, the Indian team had won only one match (against East Africa) and lost every other match. On the other hand, the West Indies had won both previous editions of the World Cup. They had reached a third consecutive final after defeating Pakistan by 8 wickets in the second semi-final and were looking for their third consecutive World Cup win.\nAs a result, the Indian team was only given odds of 66–1 at the start of the final.\nMatch details.\nAfter losing the toss, India was asked to bat first against a West Indies team that arguably boasted the world's best bowling attack. Sunil Gavaskar, who had a generally unsuccessful tournament, got dismissed early on for two. A partnership between Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Mohinder Amarnath took India past the 50 mark, before the former was taken lbw by Marshall. Amarnath was then bowled by Holding for 26, and only eleven more runs were made before Yashpal Sharma fell. Kapil Dev, the Indian captain, took 8 balls to reach 15, but was caught off the bowling of Larry Gomes; leaving India at 110/5. Kirti Azad didn't score any runs. Roger Binny was caught on two, while Sandeep Patil made 27 to get India to 153/8. All-rounder Madan Lal soon followed for 17, and 10th wicket partnership made 22 runs before Michael Holding bowled Syed Kirmani for 14. India were thus bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs, which many thought was easily reachable. Andy Roberts had claimed three wickets, and Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding and Larry Gomes took two wickets each. Sandeep Patil and Madan Lal saved the game to get the team past the 150-run mark at a critical point in the match where India scored 183 runs. After India was bowled out for just 183 runs, Kapil Dev told everyone to fight for every single run. The first over by Kapil Dev was a Maiden. If it also wasn't for Kapil Dev's 175, India wouldn't have made it to the 1983 CWC final.\nThe West Indies set out to chase the low target of 184 but lost an early wicket when Balwinder Sandhu famously clean bowled Gordon Greenidge. Desmond Haynes and Viv Richards, batted smoothly past 50, but both batsmen were removed by the bowling of Madan Lal, leaving the West Indies at 57/3. Lal soon claimed a third wicket – that of Gomes – and Dev then caught West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, leaving the West Indies at 66/5. Ten runs later, Faoud Bacchus was removed by Sandhu. Jeff Dujon and Malcolm Marshall put on a partnership of 43 runs before Mohinder Amarnath dismissed them on 119 and 124 respectively. Soon, Kapil Dev trapped Andy Roberts for an lbw, and Amarnath got Michael Holding out LBW. The West Indies were thus all out for 140, and India had won their maiden Cricket World Cup by 43 runs. The Indian bowlers had completed one of the biggest upsets in cricket history, defeating the previously invincible West Indies. Both Amarnath and Lal had taken three wickets for India, while Sandhu claimed two. Amarnath was awarded the Man of the Match for his all-round performance. There was no \"Man of the Series\" award in 1983.\nScorecard.\nIndian innings.\nFall of wickets 1-2 (Sunil Gavaskar), 2–59 (Krishnamachari Srikkanth), 3–90 (Mohinder Amarnath), 4–92 (Yashpal Sharma), 5–110 (N Kapil Dev), 6–111 (Kirti Azad), 7–130 (Roger Binny), 8–153 (Sandeep Patil), 9–161 (Madan Lal), 10–183 (Syed Kirmani)\nWest Indies innings.\nFall of wickets 1-5 (Greenidge), 2-50 (Haynes), 3-57 (Richards), 4-66 (Gomes), 5-66 (Lloyd), 6-76 (Bacchus), 7-119 (Dujon), 8-124 (Marshall), 9-126 (Roberts), 10-140 (Holding)"

        "title": "1987 Cricket World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1987 Cricket World Cup Final (known as the Reliance Cricket World Cup Final for sponsorship reasons) was a One Day International (ODI) cricket match played at Eden Gardens in Calcutta, India, on 8 November 1987 to determine the winner of the 1987 Cricket World Cup. It was contested by Australia and England, both of whom had yet to win the trophy. The 1987 World Cup was the first World Cup to be hosted outside of England; it was also the first World Cup to feature a 50-over per side match format and the first time the final had been hosted at a venue other than Lord's. It is reported that 95,342 spectators attended the match.\nBackground.\nAustralia went into the 1987 World Cup having lost a home Ashes series and their five previous ODI matches leading up to the tournament. Steve Waugh, who was competing in his first World Cup and would become one of the players of the tournament, said that Australia were considered, both at home and abroad, to be \"rank outsiders\". Under coach Bob Simpson, the Australians undertook extra fielding sessions upon arriving in India, and an alcohol ban between games was also imposed. While these somewhat revolutionary measures were ridiculed by other teams, Simpson's approach would pay off as Australia progressed through the tournament. &lt;br&gt;\nPlaced in Group A along with India, New Zealand and Zimbabwe, the Australians finished second in the group behind India on run rate, which meant they would face Pakistan, who topped Group B, in the semi-final. Australia's success had been built on various factors: the opening pair of David Boon and Geoff Marsh (who ended the tournament as the second- and third-highest individual run-scorers respectively) consistently gave the Australian innings a firm foundation on which to build substantial scores; opening bowler Craig McDermott (who ended the tournament as the leading wicket-taker with 18) excelled in conditions traditionally unfavourable to pace bowlers; and all-rounders Simon O'Donnell and Steve Waugh chipped in at critical moments with bat and ball. &lt;br&gt;\nAll these factors came to the fore when Australia upset the Pakistanis at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore; Batting first, Marsh and Boon put on 73 for the first wicket as the Australians finished with 267 for eight off their 50 overs, with Waugh scoring 18 runs off the final over. In reply, Pakistan fell to 38 for three before Imran Khan and Javed Miandad set about resurrecting the innings. But after they were removed, McDermott proceeded to clean up the tail and send Australia into its first World Cup final since 1975.\nIn Group B along with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Indies, England finished second behind Pakistan with wins over West Indies (considered the best cricket team in the world at the time) and Sri Lanka, and would face India in semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium in Bombay. After being sent in by the home side, England posted 254 for six from its 50 overs, led by 115 from Graham Gooch (who ended the tournament as the leading run-scorer) and 56 from captain Mike Gatting. India's innings started badly when home-town hero Sunil Gavaskar was bowled by Philip DeFreitas for 4. The middle order, led by Mohammad Azharuddin, revived the home crowd's hopes, but after off-spinner Eddie Hemmings struck with four wickets, the chase collapsed, with the last five wickets falling for only 15 runs. Like Australia, England had qualified for its second shot at glory, having previously lost to West Indies in 1979.\nDetails.\n8 November in Calcutta was a fine and hot day, but with less humidity than Bombay, where the England–India semi-final had been staged. Preparation of the Eden Gardens wicket had been overseen by the renowned Adelaide Oval curator Les Burdett, who had been invited by the Bengal Cricket Association.\nAllan Border won the toss and chose to bat. As they had done for much of the tournament, openers Geoff Marsh and David Boon gave Australia a fantastic start, benefiting from the unusually wayward and undisciplined bowling of Philip DeFreitas and Gladstone Small (who conceded six no-balls) to post 52 off the first ten overs. Waugh joined Veletta for the final over of the innings, to be bowled by DeFreitas. The pair combined to score 11 runs off it to push Australia's score to 253, becoming the first team all tournament to score more than 250 against England.\nThe Australians took to the field with some confidence that their total was defendable; no team batting second at this World Cup had successfully chased 254. England's innings started badly when McDermott trapped Tim Robinson in front for a golden duck midway through the first over. Bill Athey (58 from 103 balls, 2 fours) top-scored, and England were almost on target, when captain Mike Gatting (41 from 45 balls, 3 fours, 1 six) handed back the initiative with the loss of his wicket to an attempted reverse sweep off the occasional off-spin bowling of Allan Border, which ended a growing partnership of 69 runs in 13 overs between him and Athey. Allan Lamb (45 from 55 balls, 4 fours) also posted a great innings, but it was in vain as the required run-rate for England began to rise. When England failed to score the last 17 runs from the final over, the cup went to Australia.\nMatch details.\nFall of wickets: 1/75 (Marsh, 18 ov), 2/151 (Jones), 3/166 (McDermott), 4/168 (Boon), 5/241 (Border)\nFall of wickets: 1/1 (Robinson, 0.4 ov), 2/66 (Gooch), 3/135 (Gatting, 31.1 ov), 4/170 (Athey), 5/188 (Downton), 6/218 (Emburey), 7/220 (Lamb), 8/235 (DeFreitas, 49 ov)"

        "text": "The final of the 1992 ICC Cricket World Cup was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne on 25 March 1992. The match was won by Pakistan, under the captaincy of Imran Khan, as they defeated England by 22 runs to lift their first ever World Cup trophy. This was the second Cricket World Cup final to be played outside England and the first in Australia. 87,182 spectators turned out to see the final.\nDetails.\nEngland and Pakistan played each other in the Round Robin stage and Pakistan were dismissed for 74 runs. However, the match could not be completed and yielded no results.\nIn the final, winning the toss, Pakistan elected to bat with Ijaz Ahmed coming in as the only change from their semi final against New Zealand, while England too had one change with Derek Pringle replacing Gladstone Small. Pakistan openers Rameez Raja and Aamer Sohail struggled against Pringle and Chris Lewis, as both were dismissed cheaply. Imran Khan promoted himself and played the sheet anchor role along with Javed Miandad, pushing the scorecard. Imran was lucky to get a reprieve as Graham Gooch dropped a difficult chance. Derek Pringle bowled 4 no balls and 1 wide in his first spell, that read 8-2-13-2. Imran Khan and Javed Miandad struggled to score free runs and Pakistan touched the 100 mark only in the 31st over. Finally England broke the 139 partnership as Javed Miandad was dismissed by Richard Illingworth for 58. Soon Imran Khan was dismissed by Ian Botham for 72, as Wasim Akram joined Inzamam-ul-Haq. The pair added 52 runs from 38 balls as Pakistan scored 124 runs from their final 15 overs as the total score read 249/6 in the stipulated 50 overs, a gettable total for England's much fancied batting side. Derek Pringle had a dream spell of 10-2-22-3, but gave away 8 extra runs in the form of 5 no balls and 3 wides, while Richard Illingworth and Ian Botham claimed one wicket each, it became the 16th victim of the latter.\nChasing the target of 250 to win their maiden world cup, favourites England lost all rounder Ian Botham for no score to Wasim Akram. Alec Stewart soon fell to Aaquib Javed reeling England at 21/2. In form batsman Greame Hick and Graham Gooch slowly pushed the score, but Hick was dismissed by a beauty from Mushtaq Ahmed, a Googly that Hick failed to read. Soon Gooch fell to Mushtaq and England were in deep trouble with scorecard reading 69/4. Neil Fairbrother and Allan Lamb tried a rescue act with a partnership of 72 runs as asking rate began to pile up. Coming back for the second spell, Wasim Akram broke England's resistance by dismissing Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis with successive deliveries reeling English at 141/6. Neil Fairbrother and Dermot Reeve could not score big, as part-time bowler Aamir Sohail completed his quota of 10 overs as England failed to utilize Sohail's spell. With the final 10 overs to go, England needed 84 runs from 54 balls with an asking rate of 9.33 per over. Soon Fairbrother was dismissed for 62 scored off 70 balls by Aaquib sealing the fate of England. As 34 runs required from final 12 balls, it was a tough task for them as Imran Khan dismissed Richard Illingworth, that turned out to be his last ball in International cricket. For Pakistan, Aaquib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed claimed 2 and 3 wickets respectively. Wasim Akram was adjudged the Man of the match for his all round performance of 3/49 and 33 off 18.\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1-20 (Aamer Sohail, 4.6 ov), 2-24 (Ramiz Raja, 8.2 ov), 3-163 (Javed Miandad, 39.3 ov), 4-197 (Imran Khan, 43.3 ov), 5-249 (Inzamam-ul-Haq, 49.5 ov), 6-249 (Wasim Akram, 49.6 ov)\n&lt;br&gt;\nFall of wickets: 1-6 (Ian Botham, 2.5 ov), 2-21 (Alec Stewart, 7.3 ov), 3-59 (Graeme Hick, 18.6 ov), 4-69 (Graham Gooch, 20.5 ov), 5-141 (Allan Lamb, 34.5 ov), 6-141 (Chris Lewis, 34.6 ov), 7-180 (Neil Fairbrother, 42.5 ov), 8-183 (Dermot Reeve, 43.6 ov), 9-208 (Phil DeFreitas, 47.1 ov), 10-227 (Richard Illingworth, 49.2 ov)"

What strategy could beat him? Nobody wanted to try to run fast from the start, Paul McMullen became the early leader and as the largest man in the field, the wind blocker while everybody else was drafting behind. Morceli stayed out of trouble, near the front of the pack, watching around him. After 800 metres Vénuste Niyongabo moved to the outside of McMullen and started to edge forward with Morceli the next man back on the outside marking anybody who dared to get too far in front. With 500 metres to go, Morceli grew impatient and eased into the lead for the bell. The Morceli started to open up his lead. Niyongabo was late to react, giving away a few metres as the lap began and never able to gain any ground. By the home stretch Morceli had more than 10 metres on Niyongabo. Down the home stretch, a 20 year old Hicham El Guerrouj edged by Niyongabo.

        "title": "2010–11 Rugby Pro D2 season",
        "text": "The 2010–11 Rugby Pro D2 was the season of the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2010–11 season. It runs alongside the 2010–11 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nAlbi, who had become the first team to gain promotion back to the Top 14 only one year after being relegated in 2008, got immediately relegated again at the end of the previous Top 14 season. Bayonne finished second-to-bottom and were set to accompany Albi in Pro D2, but Montauban were revealed to have serious financial troubles and were relegated instead. A month later, the LNR's financial arm, DNACG, announced that Montauban would be further dropped to Fédérale 1, allowing Aix-en-Provence, who finished second-to-bottom in Pro D2, to stay. This meant that only the bottom finisher, Lannemezan, would be relegated to Fédérale 1 that year.\nCarcassonne and Saint-Étienne, last year's Fédérale 1 two finalists, gained promotion to Pro D2 for the first time in their history, whilst Agen and La Rochelle, respectively champions and promotion play-offs winners, were promoted to the Top 14.\nLyon, who lost the promotion final the previous year, established themselves as a candidate for the title from early on in the season along with recently relegated Albi. But whilst Albi struggled to keep their momentum after the Christmas break, Lyon managed to maintain their winning ways and held on to their top spot until the end of the season despite a remarkable finish by Grenoble, who had missed on a semi-final spot because of an unfavourable head-to-head against Pau the previous year, and who came back from a poor start to finish within two points of Lyon, the smallest margin between the top two teams since the establishment of the Pro D2, and seven points clear of Albi. In the promotion semi-finals, Albi saw off Mont-de-Marsan after extra time, while Grenoble couldn't capitalise on their home ground advantage and fell to fifth-placed Bordeaux-Bègles. In the final, Bordeaux-Bègles defeated Albi 21–14 to reach the Top 14 for the first time since Bordeaux and Bègles merged to form a new club in 2006.\nThe previous year's two losing semi-finalists, Oyonnax and Pau, both had disappointing seasons, finishing eighth and ninth, respectively. The two newly promoted teams, Carcassonne and Saint-Étienne, fared very differently. While Carcassonne enjoyed a very successful season, to the point that they looked like a credible candidate for the promotion playoffs for the first half of the season, ultimately finishing in tenth, Saint-Étienne had a nightmarish season, with a single win, one draw and twenty-eight losses, amounting to 17 points, the poorest-ever record in the Pro D2 (Lannemezan had finished with 19 points the previous year).\nAix-en-Provence, who had been reprieved the previous year, looked like they were going to be part of a three-way battle with Dax and Colomiers to avoid the second relegation spot, but a string of victories in the second half of the season ensured that they would stay in Pro D2 for at least a third consecutive year. Dax and Colomiers fought until the last day, both finishing with 55 points, but a better head-to-head allowed Dax to clinch the coveted 14th spot, and sent Colomiers to Fédérale 1.\nPrevious season.\nAgen, who had been a favorite for promotion ever since they were relegated at the end of the 2006–07 season, finally lived up to the expectations and dominated the championship from the start, finishing with an 11-point margin over second-placed Lyon and thus earning promotion to the 2010–11 Top 14 season. Lyon and La Rochelle made the most of the home ground advantage to qualify for the promotion final with victories over Pau and Oyonnax, respectively, and faced each other in the final. La Rochelle, despite having lost both confrontations against Lyon during the regular season, triumphed 32–26 and earned the right to accompany Agen in the Top 14 after eight years spent in Pro D2.\nThe two newly promoted teams, Aix-en-Provence and Lannemezan, were not able to rival the other teams and from early on in the season occupied the bottom two places that they were to keep until the end. Lannemezan in particular finished with only three wins out of thirty games (one of which against arch-rivals Tarbes), amounting to 19 points, the poorest record in the Pro D2 since the introduction of the bonus points.\nHowever, in a new twist of events, Montauban, who were already relegated to Pro D2 for financial reasons (thus saving Bayonne's spot in the Top 14), failed their audit on June 10, and were further relegated to Fédérale 1. Their decision not to appeal the DNACG's ruling also meant that Aix would be reprieved and compete again in Pro D2 for the next year.\nCompetition format.\nThe top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nResults.\nKey.\nThe score of the game is given by the middle (third and fourth) columns. The first and last columns indicate the number of tries scored by the home and the away team, respectively. A blue border indicates that the team has earned an attacking bonus point (i.e. has scored at least three more tries than its opponent), a yellow one that the team has earned a defensive bonus point (defeat by 7 points or less). If a team earns both bonus points, this will be indicated by a green border.\nPromotion playoffs.\nAll times CEST."

        "text": "Frank Hauser (born October 18, 1957) is an American football coach and former player. He played at Wesleyan University and served as the school's head football coach for 18 years, from 1992 to 2009. With 68 wins in 18 years as Wesleyan's head coach, he is the second winningest football coach in Wesleyan history.\nAthletic career.\nHauser attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut from 1975 to 1979. He played linebacker for Wesleyan's football team and was also a member of Wesleyan's wrestling team for four years. He graduated from Wesleyan in 1979 and subsequently received an M.A. from the university.\nEarly coaching career.\nAfter graduating from Wesleyan, Hauser began his career in coaching and education at Middletown High School as a mathematics teacher and an assistant coach in several sports. He later became the head football coach at Glastonbury High School and led the team to an 11–0 record and the Class LL Connecticut state championship in 1984.\nWesleyan.\nIn 1986, Hauser returned to his alma mater as an assistant coach for the Wesleyan football team. He was the team's defensive coordinator starting in 1986 and became the head football coach in 1992. He was also an assistant men's basketball coach at Wesleyan from 1988 to 1992. In 18 years as Wesleyan's head coach, Hauser compiled a career record of 68–76, making him the second winningest football coach in the school's 120-year football history (trailing only Norm Daniels with 76 wins). His best season at Wesleyan was 1997 when the football team finished with a 7–1 and a three-way tie for the Little Three championship. He also led the team to 6–2 records in 1993 and 1998. He put together a record of 54–42 in his first 12 years as Wesleyan's head coach, but he failed to post a winning record for six straight years from 2004 through 2009. In those years, the team compiled a record of 14–34, including an 0–8 season in 2005 and a 1–7 season in 2008. In December 2009, Hauser was fired from his position as Wesleyan's head coach. Hauser's former assistant coach, John Skubel, said at the time, \"I thought he was a brilliant coach who was great with the kids. A long time ago he volunteered to tutor kids in math there and he's an alumnus of Wesleyan. I have no idea what their reasons are, but all I know is that he's a great coach.\" Hauser retained his position as an adjunct professor of physical education at Wesleyan.\nHartford Colonials.\nIn May 2010, Hauser was hired as the linebackers coach for the Hartford Colonials of the United Football League. Interviewed about his new position, Hauser said, \"I like what I'm doing and that it's at a pretty high level. It's real good so far and the nice thing is it's professional football, all football all the time. There's no recruiting or any of the other things that come with college football.\""

In that snippet, he is only identified as Smith and is said to be from Jersey City, New Jersey. The \"Brooklyn Eagle\" from the same date – Cincinnati was facing the Brooklyn Grays – says that Mr. Smith was from Louisville, Kentucky. The reconciliation between these two apparently contradictory facts can be found in the May 19 issue of \"Sporting Life\", which says Jersey City has a new pitcher called Rex Smith who hails from Louisville.

He attended Tweed River High School, where he represented the NSW CHS under 15's schoolboy team in 2006. In 2008 James, who then attended Palm Beach Currumbin High School, played in the school's ARL Schoolboy Cup winning side. They defeated Matraville Sports High School 24–22 in the final with James winning the Peter Sterling Medal as player of the year. Later that year, he represented the Queensland Schoolboys, before being selected for the Australian Schoolboys.\nGold Coast Titans.\nJames made his NRL debut in round 14 of the 2010 season for the Gold Coast Titans at Robina Stadium. The Gold Coast won 28–14 over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, with James starring on debut against Manly's more experienced forward pack.\nHe played four matches in the 2010 NRL season, coming off the bench each time. He was named in the 2010 National Youth Competition team of the year in the .\nJames played in the 2011 All Stars match, coming off the bench for the Indigenous All Stars. James made 14 appearances for the club during the 2011 NRL season which saw the Gold Coast finish last and claim their first wooden spoon.\nIn round 1 of the 2016 NRL Finals Series, James in the 74th minute of play had scored his 13th try of the season breaking the 76-year-old record of most tries scored by a front rower in a single season.\nDuring the 2017 NRL season, the club endured a torrid time on and off the field with then coach Neil Henry and star recruit Jarryd Hayne reportedly involved in a long-standing feud. Following the club's round 24 loss to Parramatta where it was rumoured that the playing group was split and Henry was about to be terminated, James angrily told the media in defence of the team and his coach \"You can say allegedly from an unnamed source and you can say anything, it's BS\". The following week, Henry was terminated as Gold Coast head coach.\nAfter being named co-captain alongside new teammate Kevin Proctor, James signed a three-year extension with the Titans to keep him on the Gold Coast until the end of 2020.\nIn the 2018 NRL season, James made 23 appearances as the Gold Coast finished in 14th position on the table.\nJames made a total of 6 appearances for the Gold Coast in the 2019 NRL season as the club endured a horror year on and off the field. During the halfway mark of the season, head coach Garth Brennan was sacked by the club after a string of poor results. The Gold Coast managed to win only 4 games for the entire season and finished last claiming the Wooden Spoon.\nOn 6 October 2019, James was invited to do the Welcome to Country speech before the start of the 2019 NRL Grand Final. As James started the speech he said the words \"As a game we stand together, side-by-side … I’m lost\". James then stood awkwardly in the centre of Stadium Australia before the Australian National Anthem was played. As a result of this gaffe, one of the Titans' major sponsors, TFH, announced that they would be terminating their sponsorship of the club, labelling it \"embarrassing\" and \"offensive\".\nThe following week, TFH announced that they would continue to sponsor the Gold Coast after reversing their decision to end their sponsorship and apologized publicly to James.\nOn 11 December 2019, James supported the idea of the Australian National Anthem being snubbed for the 2020 Indigenous All Stars game saying it didn't represent Aboriginal Australians. On 31 January 2020, James suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury during pre-season training for the 2020 NRL season and was ruled out of action indefinitely. Gold Coast head of performance and culture Mal Meninga said in a statement \"Everyone at the Titans shared Ryan's pain today, He is obviously a hugely popular part of this club, and earned even more respect with the positive way he applied himself to his recovery from the original injury last year, without ever once getting down or feeling sorry for himself\".\nJames joined Canberra for two years starting in 2021, subject to passing a physical with his new club's medical staff.\nCanberra.\nIn round 1 of the 2021 NRL season, he made his debut for Canberra and scored a try in their 30-12 victory over Wests Tigers.\nIn round 12, James was sent to the sin bin for kneeing Sydney Roosters player Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in the head during Canberra's 44-16 defeat. James returned during the game to score a try.\nOn 10 August 2021, James signed a two-week loan deal to join bottom placed Canterbury-Bankstown.\nJames made his club debut for Canterbury in round 22 against the New Zealand Warriors which ended in a 24-10 loss.\nOn 23 September 2021, James signed a contract to join Brisbane after being released early from his Canberra contract."

        "title": "Welsh Field Archery Association",
        "text": "The Welsh Field Archery Association (WFAA) is the governing body of field archery in Wales. The WFAA is affiliated to the world governing body, the International Field Archery Association (IFAA). which is a member of the leading World Sport for all association TAFISA. The WFAA manages all aspects of the sport in Wales, including governance, national teams, organisation and administration of national and international tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe WFAA was founded in after the \"British Field Archery Association\" merged with the \"English Field Archery Association\" to form the EFAA. The merger of the BFAA and EFAA was designed to bring the sport under a single governing body but in the event, this did not suit the majority of the membership. In 1967, the Scottish members broke away and formed the \"Scottish Field Archery Association\". This development precipitated a meeting of the \"Welsh Company of Archers\" which was held at Glyncornel Centre, Rhondda in December 1969 where it was decided to form the \"Welsh Field Archery Association\" (WFAA) as the governing body of the sport of field archery in Wales. This development spelt the birth of the WFAA of today and also of the now well known format in the UK whereby each of the Home Nations has its own governing body. This format also means that Great Britain is not represented in the IFAA code of field archery at international level.\nStructure and Management of the WFAA.\nThe WFAA is headed by its president, who chairs the WFAA General Committee. This Committee bears overall responsibility for the running of the Association and consists of administrators who manage record keeping, communication, finances, tournament management, coaching activities, and team selection. Each member club has a representative on the General Committee. The Committee also has an IFAA Delegate who represents Wales' interests with the IFAA and who attends the bi-annual IFAA World Council Meeting.\nIn addition, there are two sub-committees: The Welsh Squad and Team Selection Panel (who are tasked with team and squad selection), and the Coaching Committee, which is headed by the National Coach (who are responsible for the management of training and development of coaches).\nDay-to-day running of archery activities is managed by the WFAA's network of clubs who manage training for archers from beginner level upwards, classification shoots, and regional level tournaments.\nNational and international tournaments are usually hosted by member clubs but managed directly by the WFAA General Committee.\nDevelopment of Field Archery in Wales.\nSince 2004 the WFAA has seen a large increase in development activities in Wales to promote the sport and increase its profile in the Principality. During this period the WFAA has increased its network of clubs, promoted membership growth, and grown its network of field archery courses across Wales. In 2009 the WFAA signed up to the newly conceived \"IFAA International Instructors Program\". Subsequently, all coaches and instructors in Wales underwent re-training and re-qualification to the new system. This has resulted in more structured training of archers at all levels in Wales.\n2009 also saw the appointment of a new post of National Coach. This position was charged not only with responsibility for development of coaches in Wales, but also for development of elite archers. This development saw a re-structuring of the Welsh National Squad program to make it more effective and structured.\nHosting of Major Tournaments.\nThe WFAA holds annual National Championships for field archery, 3D Bowhunting and Indoor target archery. Archers from Wales also compete in the \"UK &amp; Ireland Field Archery Championships\" which are held annually and which consists of archers from Wales, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The hosting of this tournament rotates around each member nation and WFAA hosts once every five years.\nThe WFAA has hosted the \"European Field Archery Championships\" twice in its history. The first was in 1980 when the tournament was held on the Dunraven Estate at Merthyr Mawr, near Bridgend in South Wales. The second time was in 2009 when the tournament was held at Tal y Coed, near Monmouth.\nInternational Tournament Success.\nThe WFAA has enjoyed international tournament success over the years, particularly during the 1980s and 2004 onwards. Wales has had 4 world champions in its history: Fabien Spalvieri (2003), Mathew Symmonds (2008, 2010, 2014), Gary Hart (2013) and Sandra Anderson (2015). There have also been a number of Welsh archers who have won the \"European Field Archery Championships\", \"European Bowhunter Championships\" and the \"UK &amp; Ireland Field Archery Championships\"."

He also played in the St. Louis Cardinals' organization. He played as a first baseman. Pemberton played high school baseball in Huntington Beach, California, and was drafted by the Mets in the 6th round of the 1972 June Amateur Draft. After playing in the lower minor leagues in 1972 and 1973, he was promoted to AA level with the Victoria Toros of the Texas League in 1974. That year, he posted a .322 batting average in 134 games and 482 at bats for the Toros. He also had 8 home runs. This performance earned Pemberton a promotion to the Major League Mets late in the season. Pemberton made his debut with the Mets as a pinch hitter on September 10, 1974, against the Montreal Expos. The next day, the Mets and St. Louis Cardinals played a 25 inning game in which Pemberton got his first Major League hit, also as a pinch hitter. In all, he played 11 games for the Mets in 1974, with 4 hits in 22 at-bats and one run batted in. In four games as a first baseman he did not make an error.\nPemberton spent most of the 1975 season in the minor leagues with the AAA level Tidewater Tides. He batted .297 in 137 games and 474 at-bats, but had no home runs for the entire season. He did get another late season call up to the Mets, this time playing just two games as a pinch hitter, getting no hits in two at-bats. His last game with the Mets that season was on September 23, 1975, which was also his last Major League game. His final Major League statistics were 4 hits in 24 at-bats for a .167 batting average with 1 run batted in.\nIn 1976, Pemberton played the entire season with Tidewater. He batted .290 in 138 games and 520 at bats. He hit 3 home runs. He was traded with Leon Brown from the Mets to the St. Louis Cardinals for minor-league first baseman Ed Kurpiel on December 9, 1976. Pemberton played in 1977 in the Cardinals system with their AAA affiliate, the New Orleans Pelicans of the American Association. He batted .241 in 113 games and 381 at-bats and 3 home runs. After 1977, Pemberton did not play again in organized baseball until 1979, when he played for the Class AAA Miami Amigos in the Inter-American League. In 1980, he played for the unaffiliated Class A level Macon Peaches of the South Atlantic League. He batted .290 in 47 games and 162 at-bats and 4 home runs in 1980. In addition to playing, he also managed the Peaches for part of the 1980 season. Pemberton died on February 17, 2016, in Oklahoma."

        "title": "Equestrian Portrait of Charles V",
        "text": "Equestrian Portrait of Charles V (also Emperor Charles V on Horseback or Charles V at Mühlberg) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian. Created between April and September 1548 while Titian was at the imperial court of Augsburg, it is a tribute to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, following his victory in the April 1547 Battle of Mühlberg against the Protestant armies.\nThe portrait in part gains its impact by its directness and sense of contained power: the horse's strength seems just in check, and Charles' brilliantly shining armour and the painting's deep reds are reminders of battle and heroism. According to Hugh Trevor-Roper, he \"does not exult in his victory. He is staid, controlled, pensive, but serene\". Titian recorded all of the foreground elements—the horse, its caparison, and the rider's armour—from those used in the actual battle. Both the armour and harness survive, and are kept at the Royal Armoury in Madrid. It was in the Spanish royal collection until transferred to the Museo del Prado in 1827.\nCommission.\nThe portrait was commissioned by Charles' sister, Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary, with Charles specifying how he wished to be presented. The emperor was very aware of the importance of portraiture in determining how he was seen by others, and appreciated not only Titian's mastery as a painter, but also the artist's manner of presenting him as a ruler.\nA seated portrait of Charles, of which the prime version is now in Munich, was painted during the same visit. Titian came to know Charles V personally, and had painted other portraits of him by this time. A highly intelligent man, Titian was quick witted, humorous and easy company. He had developed such a strong friendship with Charles by the time of this portrait that the emperor's courtiers were uneasy at the extent that a lowly painter was allowed into his confidence. While in Augsburg, Titian was given an apartment close to Charles' own, and allowed easy access and frequent meetings with the emperor.\nDuring his stay in Augsburg, Titian painted two portraits of Charles V: the equestrian portrait and the seated civilian portrait. Titian described imperial Augsburg as the glory of the world and told his friend Lorenzo Lotto that he was surrounded by all the favours of the court and of the Emperor.\nDescription.\nThe painting contains a mix of styles; passages such as the armor and harness display the realism of Titian's early work, while the trees, landscape and sky are built from the broad stretches of colour and strong brushstrokes associated with his work from the 1540s on. It contains surprisingly few iconographic elements, but they are not absent. Pietro Aretino, a contemporary writer whom Titian painted, suggested that he incorporate conventional references to religion and fame. The lance alludes to Saint George, the exemplar of the \"traditional image of a military knight-saint\". The red around Charles' helmet, his sash and on the horse's trim, represents the Catholic faith in the wars of the 16th century. Titian was so keen to capture such vivid reds that he requested a half pound of red lake be brought from Venice to Augsburg. His instruction reveals that he regarded that pigment \"so burning and so splendid...that in comparison the crimson on velvet and silk will become less beautiful\".\nDrawing on sources such as Roman military art (the statue of Marcus Aurelius on horseback), Renaissance equestrian imagery such as the engravings of Hans Burgkmair, and possibly Dürer's 1513 engraving \"Knight, Death and the Devil\", Titian departs from the traditional rendering of rider on horse, in which one of the horse's front legs is raised (as seen in the gallery of Roman and Renaissance works below). Instead, the horse rears slightly, or may be striking off into a canter, with only its hind legs touching the ground, while Charles still holds the reins lightly, upright but at ease, implying his advanced horsemanship. The influence of the Dürer engraving is subtle. Dürer's knight rides through dark woods, passing figures representing evil and mortality, including a pig-snouted devil and death riding a pale horse. In contrast Charles emerges from a dark wood into an open, though brooding landscape.\nTitian creates a tension between the emperor's age and physical frailty, and his reputation as a forceful and determined, dynamic leader. This is most apparent in the fact that Titian portrays Charles heroically, but places him in a calm dawn setting in which there are no signs of battle. Charles' frailty is underlined by the dark overhead clouds, his weary facial expression and weak jaw (his lower jaw protrudes beyond the line of the upper part), though this is subverted so that it instead conveys his resolve. Charles further suffered from gout, and in reality was carried to the battle in a litter. In the portrait, Titian achieves a feeling of steadiness and control through passages such as the darkly painted wood behind the rider, the evenly clouded sky, and Charles' detached, yet steely, gaze into the distance. The sense of forward motion is suggested by the angle of the spear and charging horse as Charles and mount arrive into the open landscape. The sky also resonates with Charles' victory, but as with the landscape, it also contains dark undertones. The skyscape is considered Titian's best, and has been described as \"flaming and shadowed, with gold light fighting with blue, deathly clouds set against a landscape [which] suggests the immensities of space that Charles dominates and the brooding, inner landscape of the soul.\"\nInfluence.\nMany later equestrian portraits of monarchs and rulers display a debt to Titian's depiction of Charles. More obvious and well known works include Anthony van Dyck's 1620 \"Portrait of Charles I on Horseback\" which incorporates many of Titian's ideals. Goya's 1812 \"Equestrian Portrait of the 1st Duke of Wellington\" expands further, removing the sense of heroism, and presenting a diminished, isolated figure, undersized compared to his mount, almost overwhelmed by the landscape around him, and charging towards a dark skyscape."

Built in 2010 next to the natatorium, it held the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games' tennis competitions. It was named after former UPRM tennis athlete and coach, Pedro “Golo” Laracuente, when his former-student Emily Viqueira retired her name from candidacy, feeling that \"[her] name and Golo's were going to compete and that [she] did not want to compete with [her] teacher.\"\nOf Puerto Rico's approximately hundred tennis courts, eight are located at the complex, with two of these being principal courts, since they are flanked by cement bleachers on both sides. It is the permanent home of the UPRM's tennis club, Mayagüez RaCktenis, whose membership costs range between $100.00 to $250.00. Its use is usually limited to the UPRM students, varsity athletes and Mayagüez RaCktenis members. However, other local clubs may also use the space. The courts aren't used for tennis exclusively, as the space can be rented and some activities, such as the UPRM Meteorology Festival, are held there. "

        "text": "John C. Tillman (born c. 1970) is an American lacrosse coach. He is currently the head coach for the University of Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse team. He previously served as the head coach at Harvard University and as an assistant coach at the Naval Academy and Ithaca College.\nEarly life.\nA native of Corning, New York, Tillman served in the United States Navy as a fleet support officer. He attended college at Colgate University before transferring to Cornell University. Upon transferring, he changed his lacrosse position from goalkeeper to defensive midfielder. Tillman earned a varsity letter with the Colgate Raiders in 1988, and with the Cornell Big Red in 1991. He graduated from the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration in 1991.\nTillman played professionally in the National Lacrosse League for the Baltimore Thunder from 1997 to 1999 and the Washington Power in 2000. He also played at the amateur level for the Toyota Lacrosse Club, which won five consecutive Southern Division Championships and a world championship in 2000.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from college, Tillman worked as an assistant coach at Ithaca College from 1992 to 1995. Tillman then moved to the United States Naval Academy, where he served as an assistant and formulated the offensive game plans for the Midshipmen. In 2002, he was promoted to the position of Head Assistant Coach, and from 2004 to 2007, Navy was one of just five NCAA teams to qualify for the tournament each season. In each of those years, Navy also won both the Patriot League regular season and tournament championships. In 2004, Navy advanced to the NCAA tournament championship game before falling to Syracuse, 14–13.\nHarvard.\nIn September 2007, Harvard University hired Tillman as the Crimson's head coach. In his first season, Harvard finished with a 6–8 record and 1–5 against Ivy League competition. In 2009, \"Inside Lacrosse\" magazine ranked Harvard's incoming freshman class as the third-best in the nation. That year, the Crimson improved to an 8–5 record, including 3–3 in the Ivy League. In 2010, Harvard defeated sixth-ranked Princeton for the first time since 1990. The Crimson finished the season with a 6–6 record. He finished his tenure at Harvard with a 20–19 record.\nMaryland.\nOn June 15, 2010, \"Inside Lacrosse\" and \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported that the University of Maryland had hired Tillman to replace former head coach Dave Cottle. He was signed to a seven-year contract with a base salary of $150,000 per annum. Tillman stated that the long-term contract was the deciding factor in taking the job, rather than remain at Harvard. \"I think what it showed me was that the administration at Maryland believed in me.\"\nIn his first season at Maryland, Tillman's Terrapins finished with a 13–5 record, the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship, and as national runners-up after a loss to Virginia in the NCAA championship game. Tillman inherited an experienced squad with 17 seniors from one of the highest ranked 2007 recruiting classes. Rather than overhaul the team, Tillman made minor adjustments to terminology and refocused the defensive scheme from man-to-man match-ups to team containment. During the postseason, Tillman remained in contact with his two predecessors at Maryland. He discussed his players and their personalities with former coach Dave Cottle, whom he invited to address the team after the regular season in which they lost to four underdog opponents. Tillman also consulted with Hall of Fame inductee Dick Edell, who led Maryland to three finishes as national runners-up. Edell, whose teams lost the championship game in 1995, 1997, and 1998 said, \"I will counsel people on the semifinals. I don't have a useful thing to say about the final.\"\nAfter the season, Navy expressed interest in hiring Tillman as replacement for retired head coach Richie Meade, but he elected to remain at Maryland.\nPersonal life.\nHe is the brother of Mac and Tim Tillman."

        "text": "In tennis, the seventh edition of the US Open Series (known as Olympus US Open Series for sponsorships reasons), includes ten hard court tournaments that started on July 19, 2010, in Atlanta and ended in New Haven, Connecticut on August 29, 2010. This edition has scheduled five separate men's tournaments, four women's tournaments, and the Pilot Pen Tennis Tournament that will host both a men's and women's event. The series included two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and two WTA Premier 5 events to headline the series.\nPoint distribution for series events.\nTo be included in the standings and subsequently the bonus prize money, a player had to have countable results from two different tournaments. Players finishing in the top three in the series can earn up to $1 million in extra prize money at the US Open. Roger Federer received the largest US Open pay day of $2.4 million in 2007 after capturing the title in both the US Open Series and the US Open championship.\nUS Open Series standings.\nThe final standings below include all players who received points in at least two tournaments.\nWeek 1.\nATP – Atlanta Tennis Championships.\nAmericans Andy Roddick and John Isner headlined the event. In the second round, former world number one Lleyton Hewitt was upset by Lukáš Lacko, but the Slovak was unable to follow up the win and instead Kevin Anderson reached his first ATP Tour semifinal. Mardy Fish took out doubles partner Andy Roddick to set up an all-American final against second seeded Isner. Fish outlasted Isner to win the title.\nWeek 2.\nATP – LA Tennis Open.\nWorld number four Andy Murray and American Sam Querrey headlined the event. Despite rocky starts in the tournament, Murray and Querrey held their seedings and faced off in the tournament's final. Querrey successfully defended his title by saving a match point and upsetting Murray in two hours and twenty-two minutes.\nWTA – Bank of the West Classic.\nSamantha Stosur and former world number ones Maria Sharapova, Dinara Safina, and Ana Ivanovic headlined the event. Shahar Pe'er became the only seed not to advance to the quarterfinals, falling to Russian Maria Kirilenko in the second round. Victoria Azarenka defeated top seeded Stosur in the semifinals en route to winning the championship.\nWeek 3.\nATP – Legg Mason Tennis Classic.\nWimbledon finalist Tomáš Berdych, Andy Roddick, Los Angeles champion Sam Querrey, and Atlanta champion Mardy Fish headlined the event. The second round welcomed a plethora of upsets with seven of the sixteen seeds falling, including the number six seed Querrey. The upsets continued as Berdych and third seeded Fernando Verdasco were knocked out in the quarters. Wildcard David Nalbandian took advantage of the open draw and won the final against Marcos Baghdatis.\nWTA – Mercury Insurance Open.\nThe Serbian pair of Jelena Janković and Ana Ivanovic along with world number five Samantha Stosur headlined the event. By defeating Melanie Oudin, Stosur reached her ninth quarterfinal of the year, breaking away from Li Na who also had eight quarterfinal appearances in 2010. Stosur's stride, however, was cut short by Flavia Pennetta who improved to a 3–0 record over the Australian. In a dramatic final, Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Agnieszka Radwańska, meaning three players (Victoria Azarenka, Kuznetsova, and Radwańska) will head into Cincinnati with 70 points each on the Olympus US Open Series.\nWeek 4.\nATP - Rogers Masters.\nPast champions Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, and Novak Djokovic, headlined the event. Of the final sixteen players left in the draw, only eight of them were seeded, with Gaël Monfils being the only player from the bottom half of the seeds to advance to the tournament's third round. Washington champion, David Nalbandian, increased his winning streak to eleven after upsetting world number five Robin Söderling in the third round. Federer won a dramatic night match against Tomáš Berdych to guarantee, for the first time at the Rogers Masters, a final four showdown against the top four ranked men in the world, joining Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray. Murray upset Nadal and Federer and successfully defended his title.\nWTA - Western &amp; Southern Financial Group Women's Open.\nDefending champion Jelena Janković, Caroline Wozniacki, Victoria Azarenka, Kim Clijsters, and Maria Sharapova headlined the event. Azarenka, the Stanford champion, suffered the first major upset of the tournament, losing in the first round to former world number one Ana Ivanovic, who entered the tournament ranked World No. 62 and having lost 17 of her last 29 matches dating back to August 2009, despite having served for the match at 5–4 in the second set. French Open champion Francesca Schiavone was the biggest second round casualty, going down to Elena Vesnina. The third round brought three more stunning results as top seeds Janković and Wozniacki, as well as Vera Zvonareva were all defeated in straight sets. The quarter-finals went to rank, with the exception of Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who joined Ivanovic, as a surprise semifinalist of the tournament. The two semi-finals saw Clijsters and Sharapova both advance in contrasting circumstances; Clijsters won through after Ana Ivanovic was forced to retire in the first set due to a foot injury, whilst Sharapova needed three sets to defeat Pavlyuchenkova. Despite having championship points, Sharapova lost to Clijsters in a blockbuster final.\nWeek 5.\nATP - Western &amp; Southern Financial Group Masters.\nWorld number one Rafael Nadal joined past champions Roger Federer and Andy Murray along with Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick to headline the event. Marcos Baghdatis had a dream run to the semifinals defeating Wimbledon finalist Tomáš Berdych and Wimbledon champion Nadal in back-to-back matches. An inspired Mardy Fish also added to his summer success by defeating defending champion, Murray, and Roddick in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. In the final, Federer took out Fish in a match that had only one break of serve.\nWTA - Rogers Cup.\nJelena Janković, Caroline Wozniacki, US Open Series tournament winners Victoria Azarenka, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Kim Clijsters joined defending champion Elena Dementieva to headline the event. The tournament saw the withdrawal of big-name Grand Slam champions Venus Williams and Maria Sharapova and also lost its top seed, Janković, in the second round. Azarenka and Kuznetsova rebounded from their first round losses in Cincinnati to reach another semifinal in the US Open Series, while Cincinnati champion, Clijsters, lost her second consecutive match against Vera Zvonareva in the quarterfinals. In the end, Wozniacki would only drop 5 games in each of her last three matches to win the tournament.\nWeek 6.\nATP – Pilot Pen Tennis.\nMarcos Baghdatis, Thomaz Bellucci and Fernando González headlined the event. Of the top eight seeds, only top-seeded Baghdatis was able to reach the quarterfinals, where he was then upset by ninth seed Sergiy Stakhovsky. After battling past Viktor Troicki in the semifinals, Denis Istomin fell to Stakhovsky in three sets in the final.\nWTA – Pilot Pen Tennis.\nTwo-time defending champion and recent Montreal champion Caroline Wozniacki joined Roland Garros finalist Samantha Stosur and Roland Garros champion Francesca Schiavone to headline the event. All four of the tournament's wildcards reached the quarterfinals, where two of them, Elena Dementieva and Nadia Petrova (who took Ana Ivanovic's original wildcard slot after the Serb withdrew due to the foot injury she suffered at Cincinnati), advanced to the semifinals. Only five days after winning in Montreal, Wozniacki won her third consecutive title in New Haven. The win also secured her first place in the 2010 US Open Series."

        "title": "Bill Gray (baseball)",
        "text": "William Tolan Gray (April 5, 1871 – December 8, 1932), also spelled Bill Grey, was an American third baseman and utility player in Major League Baseball between 1890 and 1898. He played two seasons each with the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds, and was the starter at third base for the Pittsburgh Pirates during his final season in the major leagues. He was officially listed as standing and weighing .\nEarly life.\nWilliam Gray was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 5, 1871.\nBaseball career.\nPhiladelphia Phillies: 1890–1891.\nGray began his career at age 19 as a utility player for the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. He appeared in 34 games in 1890—his first season with the team—amassing a .242 batting average in his debut season, the same as his career average. During the year, he scored 20 runs and batted in 21. At the plate, he hit eight doubles and four triples, and stole five bases during the year. In the field, Gray appeared at seven positions on the diamond (all but pitcher and shortstop) in his first year, making ten appearances in the outfield (six games in left, three in center, and one in right), eight each at second base and third base, seven behind the plate at catcher, and one at first base.\nGray's batting declined during the 1891 season, as he amassed no extra-base hits and his batting average dropped to .240. He scored eleven runs, batted in seven, and stole three bases; he also walked three times. His 81 plate appearances, 73 times at bat, and 23 games played were all second-best among Philadelphia's bench (Ed Mayer). Defensively, he appeared in games at five positions; catcher was his most utilized role, as it was the only position that he played in more than ten games. He made nine errors behind the plate and caught 26% of potential baserunners stealing.\nAthletics and Grays: 1892.\nDuring the 1892 season, Gray played in the minor leagues for the Providence Grays and the Philadelphia Athletics of the Eastern League, which at that time represented the top level (A) of minor league play. He played for the Grays from April 30 through June 18, and then with the Athletics (alongside Matt Kilroy and Jim Devlin) from June 20 to the conclusion of the season on September 12. Between the two teams, Gray collected 15 doubles, 3 triples, and 1 home run, the first of his minor league career. He batted .251 and slugged .336 while stealing 16 bases and scoring 45 runs.\nIndianapolis: 1894.\nGray played with the Indianapolis Hoosiers in 1894, but no information about that year's team is available other than their roster.\nCincinnati Reds: 1895–1896.\nIn 1895, Gray returned to the National League with the Cincinnati Reds, appearing in 43 games as an infielder—adding 5 games at shortstop to his repertoire of positions—5 games as a catcher, and 1 game in left field. He led Cincinnati's bench players in doubles (17) and runs batted in (29), while placing second with 4 triples and 15 walks. He batted .304, the highest average of his professional career, and hit his only home run in the majors during that season as well.\nThe 1896 season was less productive for Gray, as he batted only .207 in 46 games and ranking last among Cincinnati's bench players in batting average, hits, doubles, and runs scored. It was also the only year of Gray's career in which he appeared at all four infield positions; in total, he played 37 games in the field at 7 different positions. Most of his games were played at second base (12 games, 6 errors in 82 chances) and catcher (11 games, 3 errors in 38 chances, 43% of baserunners caught stealing).\nIndianapolis: 1897.\nIn 1897, Gray played a second stint with the Hoosiers, now known as the \"Indians\", of the Western League. It was his most productive season as a player; at age 26, he played in 125 games for the Hoosiers, batting .347, the fifth-highest average on the team. He hit 19 home runs to lead the Hoosiers, adding 26 doubles, 11 triples, and 13 stolen bases. He also led Indianapolis with 21 sacrifice hits. After the season, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates with four other players in a deal that included Pink Hawley.\nPittsburgh Pirates: 1898.\nAfter trading for Gray, the Pirates made him their starter at third base for the 1898 season; it was the only year in his major league career in which he appeared at only one position. In 585 plate appearances—third-most on the team—Gray led the Pirates in doubles (17) and batted in 67 runs, second to Jack McCarthy. He notched 121 hits in 528 at bats (a .229 average), taking 28 walks and scoring 56 runs. In the field, however, he committed 59 errors in 486 chances. While a high total in the modern era (Chipper Jones led the major leagues in 2009 with 22 errors at third base), it was not unheard of for the National League at the turn of the century; the third basemen who led that league in errors between 1891 and 1900 averaged 70 errors per season. Still, Gray's 59 were second only to the 60 committed by Barry McCormick in 1898, and it was the last season that he ever played in the top-level leagues.\nFinal minor league years: 1899–1900.\nGray played for the Milwaukee Creams of the Western League in 1899—playing there from April 28 to August 30 of that year—and moved to the Detroit Tigers and then the Hoosiers again for the 1900 season. In his final year, he batted .282 with the Tigers between April 27 and June 19 while adding a double and two stolen bases. When he moved to the Hoosiers (June 26 – July 15), he batted .242 with two additional stolen bases and three doubles. Gray left the Western League the year before it became the American League and became recognized as a major league.\nAfter baseball.\nGray died on December 8, 1932, in his hometown of Philadelphia, as a result of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. He is interred at Ivy Hill Cemetery."

        "text": "This is a list of cricket grounds in Ireland, inclusive of all-Ireland.\nCricket was introduced to Ireland by the English in the towns of Kilkenny and Ballinasloe in the early 19th century. The game increased in popularity until the early 1880s. The Land War in the 1880s resulting from the Irish Land Commission and a ban on playing \"foreign\" games by the Gaelic Athletic Association set back the spread of cricket. Anyone playing foreign games such as cricket would be banned from the extremely popular Irish games such as hurling and Gaelic football, which in turn had a detrimental impact on the game. The ban was not lifted until 1970, after which time cricket has continued to grow in popularity."

He was then recruited away to Beebe High School in nearby Beebe. It was under the low ceilings of Beebe High home court where Adams learned to flatten the trajectory of his shot, becoming one of the early pioneers of the jump shot.\nAdams then went to the University of Arkansas on a basketball scholarship. He lettered from 1938 to 1941 and led the Razorbacks to the 1941 NCAA Final Four, where they fell to the Washington State Cougars.\nAdams was the leading scorer in the tournament, netting 48 points in two games. Adams was the first Razorback to score 30+ points in a single game. He was a two-time all Southwest Conference pick and a Consensus first team All-American in 1941.\nAfter his collegiate career ended, Adams played for the Phillips 66ers in the AAU. He was named to the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 1979. He died of cancer three months later in Bartlesville, Oklahoma."

The Czech Republic defeated Slovakia 5–3 to win its second championship.\nBackground.\nThe game marked the first time the two former member-nations of Czechoslovakia would meet each other Final, after becoming independent in 1993, just about seven years before. It also was the first time independent Slovakia would reach the finals of the IIHF World Championships, jumping up from a previous best placement of seventh, achieved in both 1999 and 1998. For the independent Czech Republic, it was its third-ever finals participation after its gold medal wins in both 1996 and 1999.\nVenue.\nThe Ice Palace in Saint Petersburg was determined to host the final of the championship. Previously at the tournament, the venue hosted both semi-finals and also the bronze medal match. In the final, the attendance was 12,350, 100.4 percent of its total capacity.\nThe Match.\nSummary.\nMichal Sýkora started the scoring for the Czech Republic six minutes into the game, assisted by Martin Procházka and Václav Varaďa. Just over three minutes later, Tomáš Vlasák buried a centering pass from Petr Buzek. Procházka added another for the Czechs at 12:25 of the first, assisted by Vlasák and Pavel Patera.\n7:43 into the second period, Martin Štrbák scored to put the Slovaks on the board, assisted by Radoslav Suchý. The Czechs suffered some penalty problems, accumulating ten minor penalties, with five coming in the second period alone, though due to the strong play of their goaltender Roman Čechmánek, the team held their lead.\nJan Tomajko scored at 3:45 into the final period to put the Czechs up 4–1, and this would hold as the game-winning goal. Miroslav Hlinka and Miroslav Šatan both scored late goals for Slovakia to make the game 4–3, with Šatan's goal giving him the tournament scoring title over Jiří Dopita. Robert Reichel's goal with just over one minute left in the game ended any hopes of a Slovak comeback, securing the Czech Republic's third gold medal at the World Championships in the span of just five years."

        "title": "Chinese archery",
        "text": "For millennia, Chinese archery (, the art of Chinese archery) has played a pivotal role in Chinese society. In particular, archery featured prominently in ancient Chinese culture and\nphilosophy: archery was one of the Six Noble Arts of the Zhou dynasty (1146–256 BCE); archery skill was a virtue for Chinese emperors; Confucius himself was an archery teacher; and Lie Zi (a Daoist philosopher) was an avid archer. Because the cultures associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are\ndiverse. The improvement of firearms and other circumstances of 20th century China led to the demise of archery as a military and ritual practice, and for much of the 20th century only one traditional bow and arrow workshop remained. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, there has been a revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows, as well as a practice technique in the traditional Chinese style.\nThe practice of Chinese archery can be referred to as The Way of Archery (), a term derived from the 17th century Ming dynasty archery manuals written by Gao Ying (, born 1570, died ?). The use of (, the way) can also be seen in names commonly used for other East Asian styles, such as Japanese (kyūdō) and Korean (Gungdo) styles of archery.\nUse and practice.\nIn historical times, Chinese people used archery for hunting, sport, rituals, examinations, and warfare.\nWarfare.\nChina has a long history of mounted archery (shooting on horseback). Prior to the Warring States period (475–221 BCE), shooting from chariot was the primary form of battlefield archery. A typical arrangement was that each chariot would carry one driver, one halberdier, and one archer. Eventually, horseback archery replaced chariot archery during the Warring States period. The earliest recorded use of mounted archery by Han Chinese occurred with the reforms of King Wuling of Zhao in 307 BCE. Despite opposition from his nobles, Zhao Wuling's military reforms included the adoption of archery tactics of the bordering Xiongnu tribes, which meant shooting from horseback and eschewing Han robes in favor of nomadic-style jodhpurs.\nFor infantry, the preferred projectile weapon was the crossbow, because shooting one required less training than shooting a bow. As early as 600 BC, Chinese crossbows employed sophisticated bronze trigger mechanisms, which allowed for very high draw weights. However, crossbow trigger mechanisms reverted to simpler designs during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE), presumably because the skill of constructing bronze trigger mechanisms was lost during the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (1271–1368 CE), or due to the increasing prominence of hand cannons in late Medieval Chinese warfare. Nonetheless, infantry archery using the bow and arrow still served important functions in training as well as naval battles.\nRitual and examination.\nIn the Zhou dynasty (1146–256 BCE), nobles regularly held archery rituals which symbolized and reinforced order within the aristocratic hierarchy. The typical arrangement involved pairs of archers shooting at a target in a pavilion, accompanied by ceremonial music and wine. In these rituals, shooting with proper form and conduct was seen as important in order to hit the target. Ritual archery served as a counterpoint to the typical portrayal of archers, who were often skillful but brash. Confucius himself was an archery teacher, and his own view on archery and archery rituals was that \"A refined person has no use for competitiveness. Yet if he cannot avoid it, then let him compete through archery!\"\nAlthough civil archery rituals fell out of favor after the Zhou dynasty, examinations inspired by the Zhou-era rituals became a regular part of the military syllabus in later dynasties such as the Han, Tang, Song, Ming and Qing. These exams provided merit-based means of selecting military officials. (Imperial examination#Military) In addition to archery on foot, the examinations also featured mounted archery, as well as strength testing with specially-designed strength testing bows.\nFootball and archery were practiced by the Ming Emperors. Equestrianism and archery were favorite pastimes of He Suonan who served in the Yuan and Ming militaries under Hongwu. Archery towers were built by Zhengtong Emperor at the Forbidden City. Archery towers were built on the city walls of Xi'an erected by Hongwu. Lake Houhu was guarded by archers in Nanjing during the Ming dynasty.\nMath, calligraphy, literature, equestrianism, archery, music, and rites were the Six Arts.\nAt the Guozijian, law, math, calligraphy, equestrianism, and archery were emphasized by the Ming Hongwu Emperor in addition to Confucian classics and also required in the Imperial Examinations. Archery and equestrianism were added to the exam by Hongwu in 1370 like how archery and equestrianism were required for non-military officials at the 武舉 College of War in 1162 by the Song Emperor Xiaozong. The area around the Meridian Gate of Nanjing was used for archery by guards and generals under Hongwu.\nThe Imperial exam included archery. Archery on horseback was practiced by the Han Chinese living near the frontier. Wang Ju's writings on archery were followed during the Ming and Yuan and the Ming developed new methods of archery. Jinling Tuyong showed archery in Nanjing during the Ming. Contests in archery were held in the capital for Garrison of Guard soldiers who were handpicked.\nEquestrianism and archery were favored activities of Zhu Di (the Yongle Emperor) and his second son Zhu Gaoxu.\nThe Yongle Emperor's eldest son and successor the Hongxi Emperor was disinterested in military matters but was accomplished in foot archery.\nArchery and equestrianism were frequent pastimes by the Zhengde Emperor. He practiced archery and horseriding with eunuchs. Tibetan Buddhist monks, Muslim women and musicians were obtained and provided to Zhengde by his guard Ch'ien Ning, who acquainted him with the ambidextrous archer and military officer Chiang Pin. An accomplished military commander and archer was demoted to commoner status on a wrongful charge of treason was the Prince of Lu's grandson in 1514.\nArchery competitions, equestrianism and calligraphy were some of the pastimes of Wanli Emperor.\nArchery and equestrianism were practiced by Li Zicheng.\nHunting.\nHunting was an important discipline in Chinese archery, and scenes of hunting\nusing horseback archery feature prominently in Chinese artwork.\nAside from using normal bows and arrows, two distinct subgenres of hunting \narchery emerged: fowling with a pellet bow, and waterfowling with\na tethered arrow. Shooting with a pellet bow involved using a light bow with a\npouch on the bowstring designed to shoot a stone pellet. The discipline of\nshooting the pellet bow was allegedly the precursor to shooting with the bow and\narrow, and the practice of pellet shooting persisted for many centuries. By\ncontrast, hunting with a tethered arrow (which was meant to ensnare rather\nthan pierce the target) was featured in early paintings, but seemed to have\ndied out before the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE).\nDecline.\nMilitary use of firearms began in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE), and general use of gunpowder weapons as early as the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). Despite this adoption, bows and crossbows had remained an integral part of the military arsenal because of the slow firing rate and lack of reliability in early firearms. This situation changed near the end of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911 CE), when the availability of reliable firearms made archery less effective as a military weapon. As such, the Guangxu Emperor abolished archery from the military exam syllabus in 1901.\nBetween the collapse of Imperial China in 1911 and beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), there was a short-lived effort to revive traditional archery practice. After World War II, traditional bow makers were able to continue their craft until the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), when circumstances forced workshops such as Ju Yuan Hao to suspend the manufacture of traditional Chinese bows.\nModern reconstruction and revival.\nIn 1998, Ju Yuan Hao resumed bow making and until recently was the only active workshop constructing bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.\nHowever, with the dedicated efforts of craftsmen, researchers, promoters and\nenthusiasts, the practice of traditional Chinese archery has been experiencing\na revival in the 21st century. Starting in 2009, they have established an annual Chinese Traditional Archery Seminar. Through new understanding and reconstruction\nof these archery practices, their goal is to create a new living tradition for\nChinese archery. Hanfu enthusiasts have also revived the traditional archery ritual.\nTechnique.\nMany variations in archery technique evolved throughout Chinese history, so it\nis difficult to completely specify a canonical Chinese style. The Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) had at least 7 archery manuals in circulation (including a manual by General Li Guang), and the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE) had at least 14 different schools of archery and crossbow theory, and the Qing dynasty saw the publication of books from over 14 different schools of archery. The commonality among all these styles is that they placed great emphasis on mental focus and concentration.\nThe style of drawing that is most commonly associated with Chinese archery is the thumb draw, which was also the predominant draw method for other Asian peoples such as the Mongolians, Tibetans, Koreans, Indians, Turks and Persians; with the famous exception being the Japanese draw technique for Kyūdō. However, during earlier periods of Chinese history (e.g., Zhou dynasty), the 3-finger draw was common at the same time that the thumb draw was popular.\nFurthermore, the various styles of Chinese archery offered\ndifferent advice on other aspects of shooting technique. For example: how to position the feet, what height to anchor\nthe arrow, how to position the bow hand finger, whether to apply tension to\nthe bow hand, whether to let the bow spin in the bow hand after release, as well\nas whether to extend the draw arm after release.\n In addition, the various Chinese styles used a variety of draw lengths: literature, art and photographs depict Chinese archers placing their draw hand near their front shoulder, near their cheek, near their ear, or past their face.\nThe dichotomy between ritual/examination archery technique\nand battlefield archery technique provides a significant example of the contrasts between different Chinese styles. Wang Ju, an author from the Tang dynasty, favored a ritual/examination style that involved a post-release\nfollow-through where the bow spins in the bow hand, and the draw arm\nextends straight back; by contrast, certain authors such as Zeng Gongliang (Song dynasty), Li Chengfen (who was\ninfluenced by Ming dynasty generals Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang) and Gao Ying (Ming dynasty)\neschewed aesthetic elements (such as Wang Ju's follow-through) in favor of\ndeveloping a more practical technique.\nBows.\nHistorical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of\nhistorical bow types existed in the area of present-day China. Most varieties of Chinese bows were horn bows (horn-wood-sinew\ncomposites), but longbows and wood composites were also in use.\nModern reproductions of Chinese-style bows have adopted shapes inspired by\nhistorical designs. But in addition to using traditional construction methods\n(such as horn-wood-sinew composites), modern craftsmen and manufacturers have\nused modern materials such as fiberglass, carbon fiber and\nfiber-reinforced plastic.\nThe following sections highlight the current understanding on some of the\nmajor design categories for Chinese bows.\nScythian-style horn bows.\nHorn bows of this style tended to be asymmetric and adopted a distinct, curvy\ndeflex-reflex profile (colloquially known as the \"cupid bow\" shape).\nArchaeologists have excavated examples of Scythian-style bows dating to the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 BCE) from the\nSubeixi and Yanghai sites.\nLongbows (self bows).\nLongbows and wood composite bows were popular in southern China, where the\nhumid climate made horn bows more difficult to use. An excavated example of a\nChinese longbow was dated to approximately the Warring States – Western Han dynasty period (475 BCE–9 CE), and its dimensions were 1.59 m long, 3.4 cm wide and 1.4 cm thick.\nWood laminated bows.\nWood laminated bows were popular in southern China because of the humid climate. Based on excavated bows from the Spring and Autumn period through the Han dynasty (770 BCE–220 CE), the typical construction of a Chinese wood laminate was a reflex bow made from multiple layers of wood (such as bamboo or mulberry), wrapped in silk and lacquered. The typical length of such bows was 1.2–1.5 meters.\nLong-siyah horn bows.\nBows with long siyahs were popular in China from the Han dynasty through\nthe Yuan dynasty (206 BCE–1368 CE). (Siyahs are the non-bending end sections of Asiatic\ncomposite bows.) The design shares similarities with Hunnic horn bows.\nThe Niya, Gansu and Khotan bows are examples of long-siyah bows\ndating from the late Han to Jin time\nperiod (about 200–300 CE).\nDuring this period, the siyahs tended to be long and thin, while the working\nsections of the limb were short and broad. However, during the Yuan period,\nlong-siyah bows tended to have heavier siyahs and narrower working limbs than\ntheir Han/Jin-era predecessors.\nMing dynasty horn bows.\nShorter bow designs became popular during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE). \"Wubei Zhi\" (Chapter 102) describes several bow styles popular during the Ming\ndynasty: in the North, the short-siyah bow, grooved-siyah bow, grooved-bridge bow,\nand long-siyah bow; in the South, the Chenzhou bow, short-siyah bow, as well as\nbamboo-composite bows finished with lacquer; the Kaiyuan bow was used in all parts of Ming China. The small-siyah bow () differed from earlier Chinese\ndesigns in that its siyahs were short and set at an angle \"forward\" of\nthe string when at rest. Its design is possibly related to the\nKorean horn bow. The Kaiyuan bow () was a small-to-medium size bow which\nfeatured long siyahs, and it was the bow of choice for high-ranking\nofficers.\nWu Bei Yao Lue (Chapter 4), another classic Ming dynasty military manual, depicts a set of bows that is distinct from those discussed in Wubei Zhi. These include the general-purpose bow, the big-siyah bow (which was used for infantry as well as by cavalry), and the Taiping village bow (which resembled a Korean bow design and was favored in northern and southern China for its superior craftsmanship).\nAlthough Ming bows have been depicted in literature and art, archaeologists have yet to recover an original Ming bow sample.\nQing dynasty horn bows.\nThe Manchurian Bow design became popular in China during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911 CE).\nThe Manchurian bow has influenced modern-day Tibetan and Mongolian bow\ndesigns, which are shorter versions of the Qing horn bow.\nDraw Hand Protection.\nBecause Chinese archers typically used the thumb draw, they often required thumb protection in the form of a ring or leather guard. In historical times, thumb ring materials included jade, metal, ivory, horn and bone (though specimens made of organic materials have been difficult to recover). Because of the importance of archery, the significance of thumb rings extended beyond the battlefield: rings were commonly worn as status symbols, and up until the end of the Han dynasty (220 CE), they were also sacrificial burial objects. Although the archaeological record for Chinese thumb protection is incomplete, the designs of excavated and antique rings suggest that a variety of designs became popular over time.\nThe earliest excavated Chinese thumb ring came from the Shang dynasty tomb of Fu Hao (who died circa 1200 BCE). The ring was a slanted cylinder where the front, which contained a groove for holding the bow string, was higher than the back. An excavation of the Marquis of Jin's tomb in Quwo County, Shanxi revealed a Western Zhou jade thumb ring, which had a lipped design but featured taotie decorations similar to the Shang dynasty Fu Hao ring. From the Warring States period through the Han dynasty (475 BCE–220 CE), excavated rings typically had a lipped design with a distinctive spur on the side (there exist several theories about the spur's function). Rings from the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) were round cylinders or D-shaped cylinders.\nApart from the above examples, describing thumb ring designs from other time periods is difficult. For example, thumb rings are absent from the archaeological record between the Han and Ming dynasties (220–1368 CE) even though contemporary literature (such as Wang Ju's archery manual from the Tang dynasty) indicates that Chinese archers were still using the thumb draw. Moreover, evidence suggests a variety of ring shapes were popular during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE). Li Chengfen's archery manual advocated using rings with oval openings, and Gao Ying's archery manual described the use of lipped rings and contained illustrations depicting an archer using a lipped ring. To date, however, the only recovered rings that purport to be from the Ming dynasty have cylindrical designs that are different from Qing thumb rings.\nTo date, there are very few (if any) excavated examples of draw hand protection for Chinese archers using the 3-finger draw. However, Xin Ding San Li Tu (a Song dynasty illustrated guide to the Zhou dynasty archery rituals) depicts a tab made of red reed (called Zhu Ji San, ) for protecting the index, middle and ring fingers while pulling the string.\nLegends.\nLegends about archery permeate Chinese culture. An early tale discusses how the Yellow Emperor, the legendary ancestor of the Chinese people, invented the bow and arrow:\nAnother myth was Hou Yi shooting the sun. Other myths also feature Hou Yi battling an assortment of monsters (which were metaphors for natural disasters) using his cinnabar-red bow.\n\"There once was a man named Cheyn who lived in a village at the foot of a mountain. One day he was attacked by a rabid rabbit. To save himself he took the branch of a tree and the sinew of a nearby dead deer and he picked up a stick off the ground and using his new contraption fired the stick and killed the rabbit. When he returned he was hailed as a hero by the village and made king.\""

The idea of the sport federation was in the air, but the status quo is privileged: the board of the USFSA Swimming Commission is still the governing body. This is how the FFN will become a \"pretext\" federation in order to evoke certain points that are considered essential, even urgent, for some French swimming officials.\nFrom the constituent meeting of February 8, 1919 an office is created. Maurice Joffrin is the active president, Mrs de la Meillale president. Émile Pasquignon Loubet, an industrialist in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, a sports patron, is named honorary president.

The Czech Republic defeated Canada 3–0 to win its fifth championship.\nBackground.\nThe game marked the second time that Canada and the Czech Republic would meet in the World Championship finals. The previous time was in the 1996 tournament, also in Vienna, Austria. In that game the Czech Republic defeated Canada by a score of 4–2 on 5 May 1996. The Czech Republic were finalists for the first time since 2001, the end of their dominance of the late 1990s and early 2000s, where they won 4 World Championships in the span of 6 years (1996–2001). Canada, however, had a more recent hot streak and were clear favorites, as they were looking for their third consecutive title after winning in 2003 and 2004.\nVenue.\nThe Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna was determined to host the final of the championship. Previously at the tournament, the venue hosted both semifinals, as well as the bronze medal match. In the final, the attendance was 7,999.\nThe match.\nSummary.\nVáclav Prospal opened the scoring for the Czech Republic at 4:13 minutes into the game, assisted by Martin Ručinský and Jaromír Jágr. This ended up to be the game winning goal, the fastest in IIHF finals history.\nA deadlock second period saw Canada go on the powerplay twice and outshoot the Czechs 11–7. Czech goaltender Tomáš Vokoun displayed a dominant performance however, facing some of Canada's stars such as Dany Heatly, Rick Nash and Ryan Smyth. Vokoun, who entered the tournament in the shadow of the legendary Czech goalie Dominik Hašek, ended with a stellar performance and a shutout in the final, the first time this was achieved in a single game final.\n3:12 into the third period, Martin Ručinský received a fast saucer pass from Jágr, off of Petr Čajánek, while rushing the offensive zone and fired a wrist shot which beat Martin Brodeur low on the glove side. With less than a minute remaining in the match, Josef Vašíček scored an empty net goal, which brought the final score to 3–0 for the Czech republic.\nThe Czechs were overall more agile and had more speed, more than likely because of the 2004–05 NHL lockout, which left 12 players of Canada's without a club team in close to a calendar year, while almost every member of the Czech roster was playing in the Czech Extraliga, or other European leagues."

        "title": "List of international rugby union tries by Jonah Lomu",
        "text": "Jonah Lomu was an international rugby union winger who played for New Zealand between 1994 and 2002. He scored a total of 37 tries in 63 international appearances, which makes him the sixth highest try scorer for New Zealand and the eighteenth highest on the all-time list. Lomu held alone the record for the most tries scored in the Rugby World Cup (15 in 11 matches at the 1995 and 1999 tournaments), until South Africa's Bryan Habana equalled his tally at the 2015 tournament.\nLomu made his debut for New Zealand in June 1994 against France. He scored his first international try in his third appearance, scoring twice against Ireland in New Zealand's opening game of the 1995 Rugby World Cup. This was followed with a try against Scotland in the quarter-finals and four tries against England in the semi-finals—the most Lomu would score in a single match. He was, however, unable to score a try in the final, as South Africa beat New Zealand to win the trophy. Lomu played 13 times against South Africa during his career, but failed to score a try against them. The only other \"Tier 1\" national team against which Lomu did not score a try was Wales. Lomu finished 1995 with 12 international tries, his highest tally in a single year.\nAfter two tries in 1996, including one in the inaugural Tri Nations Series, Lomu was unable to score in three appearances during 1997. At the 1999 Rugby World Cup, he scored in each of New Zealand's group stage matches against Tonga, England and Italy. He followed this with a try against Scotland in the quarter-finals and two tries in the semi-finals, as New Zealand lost to France. Lomu's tally of eight tries in this tournament is a World Cup record, although it has since been equalled by Habana in the 2007 tournament and Lomu's countryman Julian Savea in the 2015 tournament.\nLomu scored four tries in 2000, including a hat-trick against Scotland at Carisbrook and a try against Australia in the Tri Nations. This was followed by five tries in 2001, once again with a try against Australia in the Tri Nations. Lomu's final international tries came in November 2002, when he scored twice against England at Twickenham. Two weeks later, he made his last international appearance against Wales at the Millennium Stadium. Lomu retired from professional rugby in 2007 due to a chronic kidney disorder. After suffering a heart attack on 18 November 2015 that was associated with his kidney condition, Lomu died at the age of 40."

        "title": "2011 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2011 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2010–11 season. A rematch of the 2006 Finals, the series was contested between the Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks and the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat. It was held from May 31 to June 12, 2011.\nEntering the series as heavy favorites, the Miami Heat won the opening game and eventually led the series 2–1 before the underdog Dallas Mavericks won the next three games to achieve their first championship in franchise history. Mavericks forward and German player Dirk Nowitzki was named Finals MVP, becoming the second European to win the award after Tony Parker (2007) and the first German player to do so. Due in part to Nowitzki's turbulent playoff runs previously, the series has been acclaimed as one of the greatest finals of all time.\nBackground.\nBoth the Mavericks and Heat made their second appearance in the NBA Finals, the first for both teams being the 2006 NBA Finals. This Finals marked a rematch of those 2006 Finals, won by Miami in six games, after the Mavericks were up 2–0.\nIt was also the first time since 2006 that neither the Los Angeles Lakers nor the San Antonio Spurs represented the Western Conference in the Finals and only the second time since , and also the thirteenth consecutive NBA Finals to feature a Western Conference champion from either the states of California or Texas.\nThis was the first finals since 1998 not to feature Kobe Bryant (2000–2002, 2004, 2008–2010), Shaquille O'Neal (2000–2002, 2004, 2006) or Tim Duncan (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007).\nThe Mavericks' appearance also meant that three of North America's four major professional sports championships were played in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in a span of eight months, with the 2010 World Series and Super Bowl XLV both occurring in nearby Arlington.\nThe Heat had home-court advantage by virtue of a better regular-season record than the Mavericks. This was only the second time that the Eastern Conference had home-court advantage during the Finals since the end of the Michael Jordan era in 1998. It also marks the first time since 1995 that the Eastern Conference team lost in the Finals despite having home-court advantage.\nThe 2011 series marked the first time a Finals match (Game 1) was played in the month of May since .\nAmong the players from both teams, only Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry of Dallas, and Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem of Miami, appeared in the 2006 series with the same team. Heat center Erick Dampier played for the Mavericks in 2006. Aside from Dampier, Caron Butler, Juwan Howard, and Shawn Marion are the only other players who have played for both the Mavericks and Heat. Eddie House, Žydrūnas Ilgauskas, LeBron James (James would reach the finals every year from 2011 to 2018, with both the Heat and the Cavaliers), and Jason Kidd have appeared in the Finals with different teams, with House (as a member of Boston's 2008 championship team), Wade and Haslem winning a championship ring. Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle won a championship as a reserve for Boston's 1986 championship team making him only the eleventh person in NBA history to win a Finals as both a player and a coach.\nRegular-season series.\nThe Dallas Mavericks won both games in the regular season.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nGame 1 was the first NBA Finals game to be held in the month of May since 1986. The Heat made only 28.6 percent of their shots during the first quarter, and this low scoring percentage early on left the Mavs with an 8-point lead early into the 3rd quarter. The Heat changed course from this point on, outscoring the Mavs 22–10 and taking a 65–61 lead going into the 4th quarter. Mavs power forward Dirk Nowitzki injured his finger within the last four minutes of the game, but remained in play, wearing a splint to support the torn tendon. Despite having a below-average performance early in the game, Heat shooting guard Dwyane Wade and small forward LeBron James collaborated on both defensive and offensive ends of the court in the fourth quarter, leading the Heat to win Game 1 over the Mavs 92–84.\nGame 2.\nThe Mavs' 15-point comeback was the biggest in an NBA Finals game since the 24-point comeback the Celtics made against the Lakers in Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals. Dirk Nowitzki hit a 3 with 26.7 seconds left to give the Mavericks a 93–90 lead. However, Mario Chalmers tied it with a 3 of his own with 24.5 seconds left when Jason Terry left him wide open. After Jason Kidd ran the clock down, Nowitzki then made a driving layup with his injured left hand with 3.6 seconds left. The Heat had no timeouts left, and Dwyane Wade's potential game-winning 3 hit the back rim at the buzzer as he fell to the ground in an attempt to draw a foul on Nowitzki. The Mavs' win broke the Heat's 9-game home winning streak in the playoffs, costing them a chance to tie the 1996 Bulls' mark of 10 straight. This was the second straight Finals with a 1–1 split after two games, after five straight years with one team leading 2–0 (2005–09).\nGame 3.\nThe Heat led most of the game, but the Mavericks fought back from a 14-point deficit. With 39.6 seconds left in the 4th, LeBron James found Chris Bosh for a 20-foot baseline jumper; Dirk Nowitzki had a chance to force OT, but missed a well-defended fadeaway jumper at the buzzer as the Heat handed Dallas another defeat to go up 2–1 in the series. It was Miami's sixth win in its last seven NBA Finals games, four by 3 points or less.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 was a back-and-forth affair, with 12 lead changes and 15 ties. Miami went up 74–65 early in the fourth quarter on a baseline jumpshot by Udonis Haslem, tallying their largest lead of the game. After a timeout, Dallas answered with 4 straight points by Jason Terry, similar to the 6 straight he scored with Dallas down 15 halfway through the fourth quarter of Game 2. Dallas would take their first lead of the fourth quarter with 5:15 left on a fastbreak layup by Terry. They held the lead for the rest of the game, although Miami cut the lead to 1 twice in the final minute. Up 82–81 with 20 seconds left after Dwyane Wade missed 1 of 2 free throws, Dirk Nowitzki hit a driving layup with 14.4 seconds left to extend the lead to 3. After a dunk by Wade with 9 seconds left, 2 free throws by Terry pushed the lead back up to 3. With a chance to tie the game with a 3, Wade fumbled the inbounds pass with 6.7 seconds left, only to make a diving save to prevent a backcourt violation. The ball landed in Mike Miller's hands, whose desperation 3 airballed at the buzzer, preserving Dallas' 86–83 win. LeBron James scored just eight total points in Game 4 on 3-11 shooting including going 0-6 from the field when guarded by Jason Kidd or Jason Terry.\nGame 5.\nAfter four low-scoring games, Game 5 saw the first time either team would break 100 points in this series. Dallas connected 13 times out of their 19 tries from three-point range. Jason Terry, Jason Kidd, and J. J. Barea combined to make 10 of those 13 made threes. Late in the first quarter, Dwyane Wade ran into Brian Cardinal and had to go to the locker room with a hip injury; he eventually returned and hit a 3 to cap a 9–0 run that put Miami in front 99–95 with less than 5 minutes left in the game. Unhappy with Terry for missing a defensive assignment and setting a poor cross-screen, Mavs coach Rick Carlisle pulled Terry from the game, telling him, \"Refocus. I'm putting you right back in.\" After less than a minute, Carlisle subbed in Terry and made the crucial decision to run the offense through him for the rest of the game. This move ignited Dallas' offense, leading them on a game-winning 15–3 run in which Terry scored or assisted on 11 points. With Miami leading 100–97, Terry passed to Dirk Nowitzki, who drew a double team and then kicked it back out to Terry for a game-tying 3. Nowitzki then drove baseline on Chris Bosh for a two-handed dunk (assisted by Terry) with 2:44 left in the game to give the Mavs a 102–100 lead they would not relinquish. After LeBron James was called for an offensive foul (Tyson Chandler drew the charge), Terry found Kidd for another wide-open 3 that gave the Mavs a 105–100 lead with 1:26 left. After Chandler blocked Wade with 1:04 left, Bosh made 1 of 2 free throws to cut the Mavs' lead to 105–101. On the Mavs' next possession, Terry knocked down a 28-foot three-pointer with James closely guarding him to give the Mavs an insurmountable 108–101 lead with 33.3 seconds left. The Mavericks won 112–103 and grabbed a 3–2 series lead going back to Miami.\nGame 6.\nLeBron James made his first four shots to contribute to the Heat taking a 20–11 lead. The Mavericks went to a zone defense that perplexed Miami and Dallas went on a 21–4 run in a span of 5½ minutes. They made 9 of 12 shots during this stretch with DeShawn Stevenson making three-pointers in a 24-second duration to give Dallas a 40–28 lead with 9:42 left in the first half. Dallas turned Miami's first six turnovers into 14 points. The Heat then went on a 14–0 run to take a 42–40 lead. With 6:25 left in the half, Stevenson along with Udonis Haslem and Mario Chalmers received technical fouls after a scuffle occurred at midcourt during a timeout. In the second half, James did not score until making a layup with 1:49 remaining in the third. The Mavericks led by nine going into the 4th quarter after Ian Mahinmi hit a buzzer beater to give Dallas an 81–72 lead. The Mavericks took a 12-point lead with 8:12 remaining. With 2:27 left, Nowitzki made a jump shot to help build the Mavericks' lead to 99–89. The Mavericks, who led for the final 22 minutes in the game, won their first championship in franchise history.\nNowitzki was named Finals MVP. He had a poor shooting performance in the first half but managed to score 18 points in the second half. When the final buzzer sounded, an emotional Nowitzki went straight to the locker room in tears, although he re-emerged for the trophy presentation. The Championship won by the Mavericks would be the first for the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, since the Dallas Stars won the Stanley Cup in 1999 and the last until the Texas Rangers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the World Series in 2023.\nBroadcast notes.\nThe Finals were originally projected to begin on Thursday, June 9, but (along with the entire NBA schedule) were pushed up ahead one week to Thursday, June 2 due to negotiations on an impending league-wide lockout at the end of the season. They were again pushed ahead to a start date of May 31 as both conference finals series ended in five games.\nThe Finals were televised in the United States through ABC, with Mike Breen, Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy as announcers. Doris Burke was the sideline reporter, while Stuart Scott hosted the championship presentation. Scott also hosted the pre-game and halftime shows along with Jon Barry, Michael Wilbon, and Magic Johnson. ESPN Radio aired the Finals nationally on radio, with Mike Tirico, Hubie Brown, and Jack Ramsay announcing.\nUntil 2014, this is the last Finals to be called entirely by Breen, Van Gundy, and Jackson altogether."

        "title": "Lancashire County Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The Lancashire County Rugby Football Union is the society responsible for rugby union in the county of Lancashire, England, and is one of the constituent bodies of the national Rugby Football Union having been formed in 1881. In addition it is the county that has won the County Championship on most occasions\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe first match arranged for the county of Lancashire took place in 1870, at Leeds against Yorkshire. This match was immediately known as the \"Battle of the Roses\" and was considered the \"blue riband\" of Northern rugby football. To be selected to represent the county was an honour bestowed long before the foundation of the Lancashire RFU and it was seen as \"the high road to International honours\".\nFormation of a Football Union.\nFrom 1870 to 1881 the government and arrangement of county matches in Lancashire vested in Manchester Football Club. Though self-appointed, Manchester FC was recognised as the authority by the other great Lancashire club, Liverpool St. Helens. A movement of emerging new clubs, headed by W. Bell, the honorary secretary of the Broughton FC, had an objective to secure a voice in the selection of county teams. Bell was supported by an informal committee consisting of: G. C. Lindsay (Manchester Rangers), A. M. Crook (Free Wanderers), F. C. Hignett (Swinton), Hunter (Birch). \nInitial approaches to the Manchester Club were declined and in 1881 a general meeting of Lancashire clubs was called at which the following clubs were represented: Manchester Rangers; Free Wanderers; Broughton; Swinton; Walton; Rossendale; Oldham; Manchester Athletic; Rochdale Hornets; Chorley Birch; and Cheetham. Notably, the Manchester Club did not take part, but a resolution to form the Lancashire Football Union was agreed. The initial committee had W. Bell as its honorary secretary and G. C. Lindsay as the honorary treasurer. \nTwo county matches were arranged altogether versus the Midland Counties and Lanarkshire (Scotland). Manchester then decided to wrest control of the county back and on 22 December 1881 met with the new Union and a duly constituted and representative governing body, its club to be called The Lancashire County Football Club, was formed. It was agreed the president, a vice-president, the hon. secretary and treasurer should be elected from the Manchester Football Club, a vice-president and a member of committee from the Liverpool Club, and the remaining eight names to be elected from clubs other than the Manchester and Liverpool clubs. Also, all Home County matches would be played on the ground of the Manchester Football Club. The first officers and clubs elected to represent the newly formed Lancashire County Football Club were:\nThe first match was versus the Midland Counties (the Lanarkshire match having been cancelled), played at Coventry on 26 March 1882. Albert Neilson Hornby became president after James MacLaren resigned the office on 1 October 1884. Lancashire was part of the Queen's Jubilee celebrations in 1887 when they were asked to play Middlesex at Kennington Oval on 12 March as a representation of Rugby Football, whilst Corinthians played Preston North End as an exposition of Association rules. Lancashire, led by Edward Temple Gurdon, won by a try, gained by Vincent Slater (Salford).\nIn February 1889 it was proposed that the county shall be divided out into five districts (Manchester, Liverpool, South-East Lancashire, West Lancashire, and North Lancashire) each with three representatives, removing club based representation on the committee.\n1890–1900.\nLancashire won the 1890-91 season of the County Championship, despite the county championship having been organised by arch-rivals, Yorkshire. Lancashire won all their games with \"not a goal being scored against them in any of the county matches they played\". They then played \"the Rest of England\", on 18 April 1891. In 1891-92 Lancashire were defeated by Yorkshire who therefore wrested the championship of England from Lancashire. \nAt this time, Lancashire County Football Club was made up of a number of clubs, and two sub-unions, West Lancashire Union (formed in 1884) and South-East Lancashire Union (predating the county Rugby Union having been formed in 1877):\nIt was postulated that the comparatively small membership compared to Yorkshire had its roots in the fact that Yorkshire had a Challenge Cup, the eligibility for which was based on membership of the county union, whereas in Lancashire there was no equivalent.\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 83 clubs affiliated with the Lancashire RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level. The majority of teams are based in Lancashire, parts of Greater Manchester and Merseyside, but there are also occasionally sides from Cheshire and even Cumbria that are members.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Lancashire RFU currently helps run the following competitions for club sides based in Lancashire:\nLeagues.\nAll leagues are by both the Lancashire RFU and Cheshire RFU and feature clubs based in Cheshire, Merseyside, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and the Isle of Man.\nIn 2018 several Lancashire Clubs lobbied the County to form a county based league system after repeated requests to change the RFU League structure in the North West had failed. The start of the 2018/19 season saw the founding of two Leagues in the ADM Lancashire County Leagues consisting of ten teams each. In the 2019/20 this was expanded to two 12 team leagues and by the 2020-21 season it had expanded to three senior 1st XV leagues consisting of three leagues and 35 clubs. In addition, two new \"combination\" leagues where formed consisting of two 10 team leagues.\nADM Premier Division \nADM Championship Division\nADM 1st Division\nCombination 1\nCombination 2\nCounty side.\nHonours.\nThe county side has reached the County Championship Final 38 times, winning the title on a record 25 occasions. Lancashire have played in twelve of the past fourteen finals (from 2003 to 2018) and has won nine of those twelve finals.\nPresidents.\nNotes: ★ RFU President"

        "title": "Sean Foley (golf instructor)",
        "text": "Sean Foley (born 1974 in Burlington, Ontario) is a Canadian born golf instructor, who resides in Orlando, Florida and has coached Tiger Woods, Lydia Ko, Sean O'Hair, Hunter Mahan, Stephen Ames, An Byeong-hun, Cameron Champ, Michael Kim, Erik van Rooyen, Sam Horsfield, Justin Rose and Lee Westwood, as well as other PGA Tour, LPGA Tour and LIV Golf professionals. Foley also coached many players on PGA Tour Canada, including players such as Chris Baryla. Foley began working with Tiger Woods during the summer of 2010. \nFoley was the head coach for the Canadian Junior Golf Association, taught at Core Golf Junior Academy at Orange County National, Winter Garden, Florida, and now operates Sean Foley Performance, a golf school for players of all abilities with locations in Orlando, Florida as well as St Simons Island, Georgia.\nFoley graduated with an Arts degree from Tennessee State University, where he played on the varsity golf team. Foley did not aim for a professional golf playing career, but had set a goal in his mid-teens of becoming an instructor to top players, after watching David Leadbetter work with Nick Faldo on the range at the RBC Canadian Open at Glen Abbey Golf Course in the early 1990s.\nFoley left the Clublink Academy at Glen Abbey in Oakville, Ontario, and moved to Orlando, Florida in August 2006.\nFoley is represented by agent Chris Armstrong of the Wasserman Media Group.\nFoley is a member of the faculty of Revolution Golf, a company that markets golf instruction videos and related content.\nCoaching Tiger Woods.\nIn May 2010, Foley denied widely spread rumors that he was about to be hired as coach by Tiger Woods On August 10, 2010, Foley helped Tiger Woods with his swing during a practice round at the PGA Championship, and confirmed the possibility of working with Woods. Foley and Woods continued to work together until Woods announced in August 2014 he would no longer use an instructor.\nFoley and Woods have made several changes to Woods' swing since late 2010. Foley has taught Woods to stay more centered over the ball and increase weight on the left side through the downswing. Foley also teaches forward shaft lean at impact, which has resulted in Woods saying that he has gotten the distance back that he had earlier in his career. Woods' swing is now steeper than it was when he worked with previous instructor Hank Haney, and he no longer bows his left wrist at the top of the swing as much as he did before hiring Foley. Perhaps the most notable swing difference is that Woods is now a fade-biased golfer for the first time in his career. Woods and Foley worked on a more out-to-in swing path, trying to avoid coming from the inside and getting \"stuck,\" which was an issue of Woods'. Woods had clear difficulty hitting draws in the earlier portion of this process, but began to work the ball both ways well in 2013.\nWoods struggled in the first few months of 2011 and then took several months off in the summer due to injury. Woods' first win with Foley came at his own Chevron World Challenge in December 2011. He then won three PGA Tour events in 2012 and was in contention in each of the final three majors of the year, but played below average on the weekends and fell short of victory. Woods won three of his first five stroke-play events in 2013 and returned to the No. 1 world ranking, and then won The Players Championship for the second time in his career in May. In 2013, Woods won five PGA Tour events, but only contended in two of the major championships. A lower back injury that Woods said began during the summer months began to worsen towards the end of the season.\nWoods worked to rehab the back injury during the winter months. He finished second in a playoff to Zach Johnson at his own Northwestern Mutual World Challenge in December. However, Woods began the 2014 season with poor finishes in his first two events. During the final round of the Honda Classic in March, Woods withdrew, citing the back injury. He would return the next week in Doral but clearly looked to be in pain for much of the time, although he did post a 25th-place finish—the best finish he would post in the 2014 season.\nWoods announced in late March that he was skipping the Masters Tournament after undergoing a procedure to repair a bulging disc in his lower back. He subsequently missed the next three months and returned at the Quicken Loans National in July. His swing was visibly shorter, one adjustment of several that Woods and Foley said they made to protect his back until it was fully recovered. Woods missed the cut in his first event back and then finished T69 in the British Open. He struggled with his driving accuracy in the weeks after returning from the surgery.\nIn the final round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, at which he was the defending champion, Woods withdrew on the 13th hole citing another back injury. He later revealed that he \"jarred\" an area of his lower back when jumping down into a deep bunker after hitting an awkward shot earlier in the final round. He attempted to play the following week at the PGA Championship but was in visible discomfort and struggled mightily, missing the cut.\nOn August 25, 2014, Woods announced on his website that he will no longer be working with Foley, stating \"With my next tournament not until my World Challenge event at Isleworth in Orlando, this is the right time to end our professional relationship.\" Foley added, \"My time spent with Tiger is one of the highlights of my career so far, and I am appreciative of the many experiences we shared together. It was a lifelong ambition of mine to teach the best player of all time in our sport. I am both grateful of the things we had the opportunity to learn from one another, as well as the enduring friendship we have built. I have nothing but admiration and respect for him.\"\nInstruction style.\nFoley is known for claiming a scientific approach to the golf swing. One of his trainees, Justin Rose, said of Foley's instruction style:\n\"Sean does not look at me as a golfer. He looks at me as an athlete and from a biomechanical point of view. He is not necessarily wrapped up in what makes a swing pretty. He wants what works for me from a scientific point of view. This is not necessarily the position that everyone strives for, but that is what I like about Sean.\"\nFoley recommends setting up with about 55% of the body weight on the left side (for right-handed golfers) and keeping it left during the whole swing until contact with the ball, when close to 80% of the weight should be on the left foot. This is the same setup and weight shift instructors Mike Bennett and Andy Plummer prescribe. Foley acknowledges the resemblance and says it is because they all studied the swings of old players that kept centered over the ball during the whole swing. Foley stated that he has \"a lot of admiration and respect\" for his friend Andy Plummer."

        "title": "2010–11 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2010–11 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut in the 2010–2011 NCAA Division I basketball season. The Huskies were coached by Geno Auriemma, and played their home games at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and on campus at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies are a member of the Big East Conference and attempted to win their eighth NCAA championship. The UConn team had won the last two national championships, and extended a win streak to an NCAA record 90 consecutive games.\nRegular season.\nThe Connecticut team opened the year ranked #1 in both the ESPN Coaches poll and the AP Top 25 Poll, following two consecutive undefeated seasons. The votes were not unanimous, with Baylor earning a number one vote in the AP poll, and Baylor, Stanford, and Tennessee earning first place votes in the coaches poll.\nRoster changes.\nThe regular season began with a number of changes, some expected, some not. The expected changes including the graduation of five seniors from the previous squad, and the addition of five new freshmen. The unexpected change was the loss of starting guard Caroline Doty, who suffered an ACL injury in July, and will be out for the entire season.\nJackie Fernandes is one of the seniors who graduated last year and is no longer with the team. Fernandes averaged six minutes a game during the 2009–10 season. She was the high school teammate of Heather Buck, who will be a redshirt, after sitting out one year for development. Kaili McLaren played twelve minutes a game for the Huskies in the previous season, and has moved on to a professional basketball career with Apollon Ptolemaidos in Greece. Meghan Gardler graduated as well, after a career with UConn that saw her minutes increase each year, playing over thirteen minutes a game as a senior. Kalana Greene was a starting guard, playing almost 26 minutes per game and averaging eleven points per game. Greene was the 13th selection in the WNBA draft, where she was selected by and plays for the New York Liberty. The final graduating senior was Tina Charles who was selected as the overall number one draft pick by the Connecticut Sun. Charles won a number of awards, including both Naismith and AP Player of the Year.\nJoining the team were five freshmen: Bria Hartley from North Babylon, New York; Stefanie Dolson from Port Jervis, New York; Lauren Engeln from Laguna Hills, California; Michala Johnson from Bellwood Illinois; and Samarie Walker from West Carrolton, Ohio.\nPre-season.\nThe exhibition games were not competitive, as UConn defeated Franklin Pierce by a score of 112–41 and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Crimson Hawks by a score of 100–41. Two of the freshman stood out at the IUP game, when Samarie Walker scored 22 points and Bria Hartey scored 18.\nNon-conference games.\nUConn opened their season against perennial opponent Holy Cross. Uconn prevailed easily, winning by an 80-point margin, 117–37.\nThe second game was a match up between the top two rated teams in the country. UConn had beaten Baylor in the previous season NCAA semifinal game, but in that game, Baylor center Brittney Griner was a freshman, and faced the senior, AP Player of the year, Tina Charles. This year, Griner would be more experienced, and UConn had replaced the veteran Charles with a freshman, Stefanie Dolson. The game started with a moderate advantage for Baylor, who led by five points early, with scores of 8–3 and 10–5. Then UConn took over and extended the lead, reaching a fifteen-point margin early in the second half 44–29. Baylor did not fold, and went on a 27–4 run to retake the lead, and extend it to eight points. UConn responded, with Bria Hartley scoring eight points in the last four minutes, and held on for a 65–64 victory. The victory extended the UConn winning streak to 80 consecutive games.\nFive days later, on November 21, the Huskies traveled to Georgia Tech, a game scheduled so that Maya Moore could play near where she had been a high school star. 7,325 fans showed up at the arena, setting a school record for attendance at a women's basketball game. Moore scored 30 points before coming out of the game to a standing ovation. The game would mark the 81st consecutive victory, tying consecutive wins record for NCAA basketball help by Washington University in St. Louis.\nAfter the conference opener against South Florida, UConn played another perennial non-conference opponent, Sacred Heart University, and won easily, 86–32, to stretch the winning streak to 86 games.\nWorld Vision Classic.\nUConn hosted the World Vision Classic over Thanksgiving. In the first of the three games, UConn easily beat Howard 86–25, to set the new record consecutive win streak for NCAA women's basketball at 82 games. UConn then went on to beat the other two opponents in the Classic, Lehigh and LSU\nMadison Square Garden: record-tying game.\nUConn met tenth-ranked Ohio State in Madison Square Garden as Part of the Maggie Dixon Classic, an annual event in honor of Maggie Dixon, the head coach of the Army team who died at the age of 28. A crowd of 15,232 witnessed UConn win 81–50 to tie the record of 88 consecutive wins set by UCLA in 1974.\nConference games.\nUConn opened its conference schedule against with an 80–54 win against USF. After playing Sacred Heart, their second Big East opponent was Marquette, who came to the UConn campus but lost 79–47.\nRoster.\na Walker transferred to the University of Kentucky 24 January 2011\nSchedule.\nThe XL Center is the Veterans Memorial Coliseum at XL Center\nε\nExhibition\nβ\nBig East\nBig East tournament.\nThe Big East tournament was held at the XL Center. The opening rounds proceeded largely as expected, with the Villanova Overtime victory over Providence the only upset in the first two rounds. In the third round (quarterfinals), the top seeds also held form.\nQuarterfinal.\nUConn faced Georgetown, in a surprisingly quiet offensive night for Maya Moore, who scored only six points, although gathered 15 rebounds. She has been held to under ten points only five times in her college career, spanning 147 games so far. Freshman Stefanie Dolson scored 24 points on eight of twelve shooting to lead all scorers. Her 24 points represented the most by a UConn player in their first post-season game, exceeding the 22 points scored by Diana Taurasi in 2001. Georgetown's Sugar Rogers scored eight consecutive points in the second half to cut the UConn lead to eleven, but UConn went on to win 59–43.\nSemi-final.\nIn the semifinals. UConn faced Rutgers, the last Big East team to beat UConn. That loss occurred in 2007. Moore, after scoring only six points in the quarterfinal, bounced back to score 17 points in the first half, and ended up with 22 points for the game. Kelly Faris added 19 points, one short of her career high, to help the Huskies to a 75–51 win over the Scarlet Knights.\nBig East Championship.\nWith sixteen teams in the Big East, and a sixteen-game conference schedule, every team plays every other team once, except for one team which is played twice. For several years, UConn drew Rutgers for two games, but more recently, the UConn schedule includes two games with Notre Dame. The Big East Championship game would be the third match up of the season between these two teams. The first two were won by UConn, but the game at Notre Dame was a close game, resulting in a three-point win by the Huskies.\nThe meeting would be the first Big East Championship match up of the two teams since the 2001 Big East Championship, a game described by Jeff Goldberg as \"the best women's basketball game ever played\" in \"Bird at the Buzzer\" ().\nNotre Dame jumped out to an early 6–2 lead, but UConn quickly responded and took an 11–8 lead. Then Notre Dame came back, and pushed the score to a seven-point lead, 20–13, forcing UConn coach Auriemma to a rare timeout. The lead went back-and-forth, with UConn holding on to a slim one point lead 32–31 at halftime. In the second half, UConn slowly pushed the margin to twelve points with just under thirteen minutes to go, but Notre Dame chipped away at the lead, and cut it to three points, with just over five minutes remaining. Stefanie Dolson and Maya Moore each made two point baskets over the next three minutes, while Notre Dame only scored four points.The Huskies won the game, 73–64, while using only six players in the rotation.\nMoore was voted the Most Outstanding player of the tournament, but some felt that Stefanie Dolson deserved the honors. One of those who felt Dolson should have won was Moore herself, who said, \"I wanted to tell Stefanie to go get [the award]\". Dolson scored 60 points in the three tournament games, a UConn freshman record.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Basketball tournament.\nConnecticut was awarded a bid to host first round games at their campus location in Storrs, Connecticut. The NCAA Selection committee rules require that if a team hosts the first two rounds, and is selected as one of the 64 teams, they must play at their home site. (Teams are not allowed to play at their home site for the third and fourth, or regional rounds.)\nFirst Round—Hartford.\nIt is not often the opposing team's head coach gets a \"long loud ovation\" rivaling that of the home team's head coach. But then, it is not often that the visiting coach has her jersey hanging on the area wall where All-American contributors are honored. The game was almost an after-thought. The Hartford Hawks were the sixteen seed in the Philadelphia region, playing the top seeded UConn team on their home court. Hartford, coached by the former UConn point guard Jennifer Rizzotti, had played UConn on six prior occasions, but each of those games were at the downtown Hartford XL Center. This was the first meeting between the two teams on the campus location where Rizzotti helped lead the UConn team to their first national championship. Despite the emotional significance, Rizzotti was focused on her team, more than the location or the game outcome. The Hartford team had struggled early in the season, winning only one of their first ten games. They played much better later in the season, and won the America East conference tournament to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. Rizzotti took timeouts late in the game to allow her seniors to least their last game to strong ovations. The game was won by UConn 75–39, with balanced scoring by the UConn starters.\nSecond Round—Purdue.\nPurdue sometimes struggled during the season to generate offense, but used defense to win 21 games entering the NCAA tournament second round. Purdue's defense was successful, holding the top-ranked Huskies to 28% shooting and only 28 points in the first half, among the lowest recorded by the team during the year. However, UConn was also a defensively minded team, and held Purdue to only 13 first half points, including a ten-minute stretch with zero points. Purdue more than doubled its output in the second half, scoring 27 points, but UConn's offense also picked up, and the final score was 64-40 in favor of UConn.\nThis was the final game at the home court for seniors Maya Moore and Lorin Dixon. While Dixon did not score in the game, the shortest player on the floor at 5' 4\" had a block for the last play of her game at her home arena. Both Moore and Dixon completed a college career without a single loss at home.\nRegional Semi-Final—Georgetown.\nLorin Dixon scored \"only\" four points, yet her performance earned her accolades from sports writers and coaches. Jeré Longman of The New York Times wrote, \"on Sunday, Dixon had the biggest impact\". Dixon's coach, Geno Auriemma said, \"What Lorin did for us tonight was unbelievably important.\"\nUConn and Georgetown were meeting for the third time this season. UConn won a close, ten point game in Georgetown during the regular season, and met again in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament. The final margin of that game wasn't as close, but Georgetown held Maya Moore to six points, one of her rare performances with less than double-digit scoring. UConn ended the first half with a rare deficit, and Georgetown build the lead to a seven-point margin 53-46, late in the second half. One of Auriemma's assistants suggested removing the 6' 5\" center, Stefanie Dolson, and going with a smaller lineup including Dixon.\nAfter a three pointer by Bria Hartley, Dixon stole the ball and drove the length of the court for a contested layup. On the next possession, Dixon stole the ball again, and passed to Hartley for a layup to tie the score. Less than a minute later, Dixon made a third steal, this time pulling up for a two-point jump shot. After a two-point jump shot by Moore, Dixon made yet another steal. Moore was fouled, and went to the line, completing a 13-0 run by the Huskies, with Dixon central to almost all of the points. Georgetown did not quit, and would score ten more points in the last four plus minutes of the game, but two more baskets by Moore, each assisted by Dixon, helped seal the win for UConn.\nRegional Final—Duke.\nUConn faced Duke in the regional Final. The teams had met once before during the season, with UConn winning easily 87-51. Duke had only two other losses during the regular season, and ended the regular season winning the ACC regular season and tournament championship. Duke had the second highest RPI in the country.\nThe game started out in UConn's favor, with UConn jumping out to a 10-2 lead. Unlike the earlier matchup, when UConn extended the lead to 23-2 before Duke scored again, Duke responded. While they were unable to take the lead, the margin was only three points with two and a half minutes to go in the first half. UConn then scored seven straight points, including a basket by Maya Moore as time was expiring to extend the lead to ten points. UConn opened up the second half with a 13-2 run, extended the lead to 29 almost halfway through the second period, and coasted to a 75-40 victory and a place in the Final Four.\nWith just under four minutes remaining in the game, Moore hit a two-point jumper to give her 28 points for the game, and a total of 3000 for her career, just the seventh player in NCAA division I women's basketball history to reach the 3,000 point plateau.\nMoore was named the Regional Most Outstanding Player. She was also named to the All-Tournament team, along with teammates Bria Hartley and Lorin Dixon.\nNational semi-final—Notre Dame.\nConnecticut faced Notre Dame in the semifinal game for the fourth time in the season. UConn beat Notre Dame by three points at Notre Dame's home court, then won by 21 points at UConn's Gampel Pavilion. The two teams matched up in the Big East Championship, with UConn winning by nine.\nIn the first half of the national semi-final, the halftime score was close, but UConn held a six-point lead. In the second half, Skyler Diggins took over, and ended up with 28 points. UConn's Maya Moore tried to win the game for the Huskies, and scored 36 points, including a stretch of 12 consecutive points, but it was not enough, as the Irish scored 46 in the second half to advance to the championship game 72–63.\nAwards and honors.\nTeam.\nConnecticut set the record for consecutive wins by an NCAA women's basketball team. They set the record for consecutive wins by a Division 1 women's basketball team at 70, set in 2003. They tied the Division I record on 7 March 2010 against Syracuse. then went on to establish a new record two days later against Notre Dame. The NCAA women's basketball consecutive win streak was set by Washington University in 2001. The Washington Bears won 81 consecutive games in a span covering 1998–2001. Connecticut tied that record with their 81st consecutive win by beating Georgia Tech on 26 November 2010, and set a new record five days later with a win over Howard University. Connecticut set the record for most consecutive wins in any NCAA sport after surpassing UCLA men's basketball program with 89 wins straight with a win over Florida State on December 21, 2010."

Brazil won 3–0, with goals from Júlio Baptista, a Roberto Ayala own goal and Dani Alves. Brazil won their eighth title, while Argentina could have won their fifteenth.\nBackground.\nIt was the second consecutive final between Brazil and Argentina; Brazil had won the 2004 Final in a penalty shootout against Argentina. The match ended 2–2 after extra time: Kily González opened the scoring with a penalty, and Luisão headed an equaliser at the start of the second half. César Delgado put Argentina back into the lead with three minutes of normal time remaining, but Adriano equalised in added time. In the shootout, Brazil's Júlio César saved the first Argentine penalty by Andrés D'Alessandro while Gabriel Heinze missed, and defender Juan scored the winner.\nMatch.\nOfficials.\nParaguayan Carlos Amarilla was chosen to be the referee, having also refereed the 2004 Final. In the 2007 tournament he refereed two more matches, Uruguay against Peru, and Chile against Mexico, both of the first round.\nTeam selection.\nOf Argentina's team which took part in the 2004 Final, Roberto Abbondanzieri, Javier Zanetti, Gabriel Heinze, Roberto Ayala, Javier Mascherano, and Carlos Tevez started in the 2007 edition, with Lucho González a starter in 2004 and substitute in 2007. For Brazil, Juan and Maicon started both, with Diego a substitute in both.\nSynopsis.\nBrazil took the lead in the fourth minute through Júlio Baptista, set up by Elano. Thirty minutes later, however, Elano went off injured to be replaced by Dani Alves. Alves sent in a cross in the 40th minute, which Ayala deflected for an own goal past Abbondanzieri to double Brazil's lead at half time.\nIn the 59th minute, Argentina substituted defensive midfielder Esteban Cambiasso for attacking alternative Pablo Aimar. Ten minutes later, Brazil scored their third and final goal: Vágner Love began a counterattack, running up the pitch and setting up Alves to score."

        "text": "James Frederick \"Ace\" Adams IV (April 10, 1928 – November 10, 2019) was an American lacrosse coach. He served as the head coach at the United States Military Academy, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Virginia. He was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1975.\nEarly life and college.\nAdams attended St. Paul's School in Brooklandville, Maryland, where he was a four-year letterwinner on the varsity lacrosse team. He then went on to college at Johns Hopkins University, where he played lacrosse as a midfielder, football as an end and quarterback, and basketball as a forward. Adams played on the Blue Jays' national championship teams in 1947, 1948, and 1950. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association named him an honorable mention All-American midfielder in 1948. The following season, the USILA named him to the USILA first team, and in 1950, to the third team. Adams participated in the 1949 and 1950 North/South Collegiate All-Star Games.\nCoaching career.\nAdams began his coaching career at the St. Paul's School, where he served as the head lacrosse and football coach from 1951 to 1953. He also taught five classes each day, and from 1952, also served as the school's athletic director. After his stint at St. Paul's, Adams began working as an insurance salesman. He also continued playing lacrosse with the Mount Washington Lacrosse Club in Baltimore from 1951 to 1956. In 1957, he served as the club's head coach.\nIn 1958, he became the head coach of the Army lacrosse team at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, after its previous head coach, F. Morris Touchstone, died of a heart attack. Adams coached the lacrosse team from 1958 to 1969 and also worked as an assistant athletic director. In his first season, he led the Cadets to a perfect record and Army was selected as the 1958 national champions. Against Duke, Adams played 33 different players in a failed attempt to hold down the score. Army won, 21–2. In 1961, in the first nationally televised lacrosse game, Army upset Navy, 10–8, to capture a share of the national championship alongside the Midshipmen. That season, Adams was awarded the F. Morris Touchstone Award as the USILA Coach of the Year. In 1969, the Cadets again defeated Navy to clinch a share of the national co-championship in Adams' final game at Army. The result was a 14–4 rout at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in front of 16,056 spectators.\nAfter his daughter graduated from high school in 1969, Adams wanted to work close to where she attended college. They considered the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University, eventually choosing Penn because it offered a free tuition and $14,000 salary for its lacrosse coach. Adams was the head coach at Penn from 1970 to 1978, which was a significant change from Army. He said, \"I went from a squad that had two first-team all-American attackmen to a team that consisted of mediocre players. They were all nice kids, but they just didn't have a lot of talent.\" g His initial years at Penn did result in Adams raising the level of recruiting as he had excellent contacts in both Baltimore and Long Island. This improved the roster during the last 4–5 years he was at Penn. In 1977, his last year, Penn had three first-team All Americans. Adams managed to guide the Quakers to several top-ten rankings, including the No. 4 position in his final year, as well as two NCAA tournament quarterfinal appearances.\nWhile working at a lacrosse camp in New Jersey, a University of Virginia alumnus called Adams and asked why he had not applied for the school's vacant head coach position. Adams responded that he had not known it was open, and after applying, was hired as Virginia's head coach. He remained in that position at Virginia from 1978 to 1992, reaching the NCAA finals in 1980 and 1986. During his tenure there, he led the Cavaliers to 12 NCAA tournament appearances and four semifinals appearances, while they twice finished as runners-up. At the time of his retirement from coaching in 1992, he had the most wins of any active Division I lacrosse coach.\nAdams was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1975. He died on November 10, 2019, at the age of 91."

It revolves around an infectious disease which breaks out during a war. It is based on the play \"The White Disease\" by Karel Čapek.\nReception.\nIn a contemporary review, the film was reviewed in \"Variety\" in 1940, who noted that Čapek's conception \"isn't entirely clear, he appears to be taking the dramatic theme that Fascism is a sort of white plague that scourges the people who follow its philosophy.\" The reviewer noted that Čapek's \"thinking is logical [but] he has certainly over-simplified the struggle between war and peace.\" The review continued that the film contained \"many gripping scenes\" praising \"moments such as the meeting between the doctor and the dictator and the solitary vigil as zero hour for the invasion approaches, while \"mob scenes are comparatively inept, and such matters as sound, lighting, photography and so on are inferior.\""

        "text": "The Rackham Golf Course is a public golf course designed by Donald Ross, located in Huntington Woods, Michigan and adjacent to the Detroit Zoo. The grounds crew at Rackham maintains one 18-hole course.\nHistory.\nIn 1924, Horace Rackham purchased acres of land in Huntington Woods, Michigan, near land owned by the Detroit Zoological Society. (Currently this land would be extending from the corner of I-696 and Woodward to I-696 and Scotia Road). Rackham promised to donate the land towards a zoo as long as Detroit voters approved of it. The voters did pass the proposal, and Rackham followed through on his promise and gave for a parking lot, and the rest for a public golf course to be built. In 1925, the course was complete. Designed by Donald Ross, who also designed the Detroit Golf Club and numerous other courses, created an 18-hole course open to the public. Rackham has also been named one of Ross' ten best public golf courses. It has been the home of Ben Davis, one of the country's first African-American golf pros. Joe Louis, the famous boxer known as the \"Brown Bomber\", played the course on a regular basis back in his day. The historic original front 9 was closed in October 1983 for major revisions due to the encroachment of I-696 extending through the area. Major changes to the front 9-hole layout were completed about years later. The 7th &amp; 9th holes are the only two untouched front 9 holes remaining from the original Ross layout.\nCourse.\nThe course is 18 holes with a Par of 71. A total of 6,555 yards with a course rating is 70.8. There are no water hazards on the entire course.\nExternal links.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Rackham-Golf-Course-189101068409924/"

        "title": "Shutout (baseball)",
        "text": "In Major League Baseball, a shutout (denoted statistically as ShO or SHO) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run. If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act, no pitcher is awarded a shutout, although the team itself can be said to have \"shut out\" the opposing team.\nThe ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game, which has been accomplished 24 times in over 135 years, most recently by Domingo Germán of the New York Yankees on June 28, 2023. Until a rule change implemented by MLB in 2020, a perfect game was previously also, by definition, counted as a shutout. A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors, base on balls, catcher's interferences, dropped third strikes, or hit batsmen. The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson, who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907 to 1927. He accumulated 110 shutouts, which is 20 more than the second place leader, Pete Alexander. The record for shutouts in a single season is 16, a mark which was achieved by George Bradley in and Pete Alexander in . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball, because pitchers rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season anymore due to a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching. Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers.\nAs of 2023, the leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw, who has thrown 15.\nOverview.\nA shutout is defined by Major League Baseball rule 10.18:\nA shutout in baseball statistics is abbreviated as \"ShO\" or \"SHO\", not to be confused with strikeout (\"SO\"). To achieve a shutout, a pitcher must pitch a complete game without allowing the other team to score a run. However, there are exceptions and other stipulations to this rule.\nJim Creighton of the Excelsior of Brooklyn club is widely regarded to have thrown the first official shutout in history on November 8, 1860. In the National League's inaugural season of 1876, the eight teams played between 59 and 70 games, but it was common for each team to only have one pitcher on the team who pitched every inning of every game. For that reason, George Bradley pitched 16 shutouts in 1876, which still stands as the Major League record (tied with Pete Alexander who pitched the same number in 1916). Bradley's 16 shutouts in one year were almost half the total number he pitched in his nine-year career as a pitcher. From 1876 to 1916, 10 shutouts or more a season was recorded 19 times. With the increase in power hitting in the live-ball era, as well as the increased utilization of relief pitchers, shutouts and complete games dramatically declined. Since 1917, 10 or more shutouts a season has only been achieved 10 times by pitchers with very exceptional seasons. Jim Palmer was the last American League pitcher to achieve this mark with 10 in 1975, and John Tudor was the last National League pitcher with 10 in 1985, not including the 11th shutout that Tudor threw in the World Series that year.\nIn 1968 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Don Drysdale pitched a Major League record six consecutive shutouts on his way to a total of eight. While his statistics that year are often overlooked when compared to fellow National League pitcher Bob Gibson, Drysdale did pitch a then-record consecutive scoreless innings pitched over the course of a month, whereby he did not allow an opposing run. He can be said to have \"shut out\" the opposition for consecutive innings pitched. That scoreless streak would later be broken by Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser in 1988, who pitched one more out than Drysdale to record 59 consecutive shutout innings. Ed Reulbach of the Chicago Cubs is the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to have pitched two shutouts on the same day. On September 26, 1908, the Cubs played a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Reulbach pitched both games to completion, in which the Dodgers failed to score in both games.\nRed Barrett (1944) holds the record for the fewest pitches needed to complete a nine-inning shutout with only 58 pitches—the fewest ever pitched in any nine-inning game in Major League history, as well as the quickest night game ever at one hour and 15 minutes. Among other records, Walter Johnson has the most Opening Day shutouts with seven, and Jamie Moyer (2010) is the oldest player to ever pitch a Major League shutout at 47 years 170 days old. Christy Mathewson holds the postseason record with four shutouts, including an unprecedented three (also a record) during the 1905 World Series.\nRecording a shutout without starting or pitching a complete game.\nIt is possible for a pitcher to record a shutout without starting the game or pitching a complete game, so long as all the outs in the game are recorded under the same pitcher with no opposing runs scored by the other team. A pitcher who begins the game is recorded as the starting pitcher, regardless of how long that pitcher pitches in the game. A pitcher must face at least one batter before being removed to be considered the starting pitcher and get recorded with the game started, whether the batter faced reached base or was put out in any way.\nIf the starting pitcher is removed from the game before the first recorded out by the opposing team, the pitcher that replaces him can still be eligible for a shutout if the game ends with the opposing team failing to score a run. However, the replacement pitcher cannot be credited with a game started or complete game. In addition to that, the replacement pitcher must complete the rest of the game without being taken out himself for another pitcher at any time during the game. An instance of this occurred on June 23, 1917, when Babe Ruth of the Boston Red Sox walked the first batter of the Washington Senators, Ray Morgan, in the bottom of the first inning. Ruth engaged in an argument with home plate umpire Brick Owens, whereby Ruth was ejected and escorted off the field. Ruth's replacement, Ernie Shore, proceeded to finish the game without allowing the Senators to score. In fact, Morgan was caught stealing, and Shore retired the next 26 batters in a row. The game was regarded as a perfect game for many years until it was officially downgraded to a combined no-hitter due to Ruth giving up the walk. Shore and Ruth were credited with a combined no-hitter, even though Ruth pitched unsuccessfully to only one batter in the game. Shore was credited with a shutout for his effort, despite not starting the game or pitching a complete game. However, if Ruth had conceded a run in the first inning without recording an out, such as allowing consecutive walks or hits, Shore would not be able to record a shutout since the other team had scored a run.\nGames lasting shorter or longer than nine innings.\nA shutout must fall under the technical definitions of a complete game, which consists of only one pitcher pitching an entire game, regardless of how long the game lasts. However, the complete game stipulation is waived if the same pitcher records every out in the game without having technically started the game, as in the game pitched by Ernie Shore. A standard Major League Baseball game consists of nine innings, unless weather or other uncontrollable elements prevent the game from being completed. If five or more innings have been played and the game cannot be resumed in a timely manner under normal conditions, it can be ruled as a \"complete game\" according to Major League Baseball rule 4.10. In this case, it is possible for a pitcher to complete only five innings pitched and still be credited with a complete-game shutout if the other team fails to score by the time the game is ended. However, no-hitter and perfect game bids are not official unless the game lasts at least nine innings. A shortened game cannot be considered a no-hitter or perfect game, but it can be counted as a shutout if applicable.\nConversely, if a game goes into scoreless extra innings, the same pitcher must pitch until the end of the game, despite having already pitched a full nine innings without allowing a run. If the pitcher is replaced or allows a run during an extra inning, he cannot receive a shutout. This situation is very rare, because starting pitchers will rarely pitch into extra innings. On June 3, 1995, Pedro Martínez of the Montreal Expos had a perfect game through nine innings against the San Diego Padres. The Expos failed to score as well, and the game was forced into extra innings. The Expos scored a run in the top of the 10th inning. In the bottom of the same inning, Martínez gave up a leadoff double to Bip Roberts to break up the perfect game and no-hitter. Martínez was immediately replaced by Mel Rojas, who retired the next three batters to end the game. Martínez was credited as the winning pitcher in a 1–0 Expos victory, but he did not record a complete game or a shutout for his efforts since another pitcher had taken part in the game. Arguably the most famous extra inning shutout was recorded by Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. Morris was named the Series MVP for his 10-inning effort.\nThe longest complete-game shutout is 18 innings pitched by a single pitcher, which has occurred four times in Major League history: John Montgomery Ward (1882), Ed Summers (1909), Walter Johnson (1918), and Carl Hubbell (1933).\nNo-hitters that are not shutouts.\nIn the majority of cases, a no-hitter is also recorded as a shutout if it is performed by a single pitcher pitching a complete game. If a no-hitter is achieved with more than one pitcher, no pitcher is awarded a shutout or a no-hitter, but a team shutout and no-hitter is still acknowledged. It is possible under rare circumstances for a no-hitter to not be a shutout (either individually or a combined effort). If the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors, sacrifice flies, hit batsman, or base on balls, the no-hitter remains intact while the shutout is lost. Since 1875, there have been 322 recorded no-hitters, and the vast majority of these have been completed by a single pitcher. Of that number, 25 instances resulted in a no-hitter that was not a shutout since the other team managed to score without actually getting a hit. Of these, there have only been two instances where the team that achieved no hits in the game actually won. One of these games was a combined no-hitter loss accomplished by more than one pitcher, and there has only been one recorded instance in history where a single pitcher lost a complete-game no-hitter.\nOn April 23, 1964, Ken Johnson of the Houston Colt .45s was beaten 1–0 by the Cincinnati Reds despite the Reds not getting a single hit. The only other instance of a lost no-hitter occurred when the Baltimore Orioles lost to the Detroit Tigers by a score of 2–1 on April 30, 1967. While the Tigers recorded no hits during this game and still won, the Orioles used more than one pitcher (Steve Barber and Stu Miller), therefore eliminating an individual shutout opportunity. Barber was replaced with two outs in the ninth inning and came one out away from joining Johnson as the only pitcher to single-handedly lose a no-hitter.\nFor games that were shortened due to weather, darkness, or other uncontrollable scenarios, a shutout can still be recorded by a single pitcher, but under Major League Baseball's official definition of a no-hitter, a no-hitter cannot be achieved unless the game lasts nine innings. Any game lasting shorter than a full nine innings cannot qualify, even if one team fails to achieve a hit before the game ends.\nConversely, if a starting pitcher on the visiting team is losing the game (despite giving up no hits) after his team bats in the top of the ninth inning, his team will not take the field again unless they tied or took the lead. By this unusual situation, the starting pitcher will only have pitched eight complete innings with no chance to pitch a ninth-inning to attempt a no-hitter. If the starting pitcher is on the home team, he will have a chance to pitch in the top of the ninth inning—a situation that occurred with Ken Johnson and later the combined efforts of Barber and Miller. However, a winning home team will not bat (and the visiting team will not field) in the bottom of the ninth if they are winning, and the game will end with only innings played. In 1991, Major League Baseball changed the definition of a no-hitter to require that a pitcher throw at least nine full innings for the no-hitter to be official. With that change, there have been four no-hit performances ruled ineligible despite the pitcher pitching an eight-inning complete game in a losing effort: Silver King (June 21, 1890), Andy Hawkins (July 1, 1990), Matt Young (April 12, 1992), the combined pitching of Jered Weaver and José Arredondo (June 28, 2008), and the combined pitching of Hunter Greene and Art Warren (May 15, 2022).\nTeam shutouts.\nIf two or more pitchers combine to throw a shutout, no pitcher is credited individually with a shutout, but the team as a whole can be said to have \"shut out\" the other team. The record for the most consecutive shutouts by a single team is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates, who recorded six consecutive shutouts in 1903. That team also holds the record for most consecutive scoreless innings pitched with 56. The Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs hold the record for the most shutout victories achieved in a single season with 32; the White Sox did so in 1906, and the Cubs did so in 1907 and 1909. The 1908 St. Louis Cardinals hold the record of being shut out 33 times in one season. Only five teams in Major League Baseball history have gone an entire season without recording a single shutout victory. In 1898, three teams—the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, St. Louis Browns, and Washington Senators—failed to defeat a team all season without allowing a run. The 1899 Cleveland Spiders also achieved this record—winning 20 games to a record 134 losses. The only team since then to record no shutout victories was the expansion 1993 Colorado Rockies. That year, the Rockies had a record of 67–95, in which they never shut out their opponents in any of their 67 wins.\nThe largest margin of victory in a \"shutout\" game is held by the Providence Grays, who defeated the Philadelphia Quakers 28–0 on August 21, 1883. The largest shutout margin of victory in recent times was 22–0 when the Cleveland Indians defeated the New York Yankees on August 31, 2004.\nLeague leaders.\nThe pitcher who has the most shutouts at the end of the season is recognized as the league leader in that statistic. The National League and American League both have their own league leaders. A pitcher that leads the league in shutouts is often regarded as one of the best pitchers in the league. Such an accomplishment often makes that pitcher a contender for the Cy Young Award or even rarer as the league's Most Valuable Player, because a high number of shutouts may yield a high number of wins and a low earned run average.\nSince the establishment of the MVP Award in 1933, each league elects their own MVP, in which 11 American League pitchers and nine National League pitchers have captured their respective league's highest individual award. The following American League pitchers have led the league in shutouts and captured the MVP Award: Lefty Grove (1931), Spud Chandler (1943), Hal Newhouser (1945), and Vida Blue (1971). The following National League pitchers have also led the league in shutouts and captured the MVP award: Dizzy Dean (1934), Mort Cooper (1942), Sandy Koufax (1963), Carl Hubbell (1933), and Bob Gibson (1968). Established in 1956, the Cy Young Award was only awarded to one pitcher in Major League Baseball; separate awards were given to the American and National League starting in 1967. Since the award was established, there have been 25 times (out of a total of 106 awards given since 1956) where the award was given to a pitcher who also led the league in shutouts. Since the establishment of the Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, three pitchers have led the league in shutouts in their rookie year and also captured the Rookie of the Year Award: Don Newcombe (1949), Fernando Valenzuela (1981), and Hideo Nomo (1995). Only 16 pitchers in the history of the American and National League have led the league in shutouts in their rookie season; only two of these came from the American League.\nWalter Johnson, Pete Alexander, and Cy Young each hold the record for having led the league in shutouts on seven occasions. They are ranked first, second, and fourth respectively on the list of career shutouts. More recently, Roger Clemens led the league six times. Pete Alexander and George Bradley hold the single season shutout record with 16 — a record that is unlikely to ever be broken. 27 pitchers on 29 occasions have accumulated 10 or more shutouts in a single season, while Ed Walsh and Pete Alexander are the only pitchers to have achieved 10 or more on two separate occasions. Of those 29 occasions, only three of these occasions were not high enough to lead the league. In the National League in 1884, Jim McCormick and Charles Radbourn had 10 and 11 shutouts respectively, while Pud Galvin had 12. Also, in the American Association in 1886, Dave Foutz had 11 shutouts but came second to the 12 by Ed Morris.\nWith the decline in shutouts, since 1999, only six pitchers—A. J. Burnett, Dontrelle Willis, CC Sabathia, Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee and Félix Hernández—have achieved five or more shutouts in a single season, although Sabathia's five shutouts are a combined total from having played in both leagues in one season. CC Sabathia is the only player in history to have led both leagues in shutouts in the same year when he did so in 2008. He had two shutouts for the Cleveland Indians of the American League when he was traded in the middle of the season to the Milwaukee Brewers of the National League. He accumulated three shutouts with the Brewers to lead the league. His two shutouts in the American League would also lead the league at the end of the year, even though he was in a different league at the time. Recently, accumulating only 2–3 shutouts may qualify a pitcher to lead or tie the league lead in shutouts.\nFor career shutout leaders, see List of Major League Baseball career shutout leaders."

        "text": "The Midwest Lacrosse Conference (MLC) is a men's National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III lacrosse-only college athletic conference composed of schools located in the Midwestern United States. All schools are members of conferences that do not sponsor lacrosse.\nHistory.\nFounding members Adrian College, Albion College, Carthage College, Fontbonne University, Milwaukee School of Engineering, College of Mount St. Joseph and Trine University ratified bylaws on June 2, 2009. The NCAA recognition of the new conference went into effect September 1, 2009 and conference play began on February 13, 2010. Many of the MLC members also field women's lacrosse as part of the Midwest Women's Lacrosse Conference, which began in 2011. \nBecause the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association added lacrosse beginning with the 2013 season, their members played their last season in the MLC during 2012. Likewise, the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin added lacrosse beginning with the 2015 season, so their teams played their last season in the MLC during 2014. The three schools in the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference starting playing in the new lacrosse-only Ohio River Lacrosse Conference in 2015 as well.\nBeloit College and Cornell College joined the MLC in the spring of 2015. Concordia University Chicago joined in 2016 and Monmouth College joined in 2017. Marian University continued to expand the conference in 2018. \nIn 2019, the conference added North Central University and University of Northwestern – St. Paul. Both universities are members of the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference for other sports and had been independent programs for men's lacrosse. Further change came before the 2020 season when the conference added Illinois Tech and Fontbonne announced that the men's lacrosse program would be suspended indefinitely due to low participation numbers for the program. In 2021, the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference brought its lacrosse-sponsoring institutions - Aurora, Benedictine, Concordia Chicago, Concordia Wisconsin, Illinois Tech, Marian, Milwaukee School of Engineering and affiliate member Beloit - directly under the NACC umbrella. This continues the pattern of the Midwest Lacrosse Conference providing league opportunities for schools until such time that their conference sponsors the sport."

        "title": "List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career scoring leaders",
        "text": "In basketball, points are the sum of the score accumulated through free throws and field goals. In National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I basketball, it is considered a notable achievement to reach the 1,000-points scored threshold. In even rarer instances, players have reached the 2,000- and 3,000-point plateaus (no player has ever scored 4,000 or more points at the Division I level). The top 25 highest scorers in NCAA Division I men's basketball history are listed below. The NCAA was not organized into its current divisional format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to spring 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\".\nNumerous players among the top 25 scorers in Division I history played in the era before the three-point line was officially adopted in 1986–87. All of the players with a dash through the three-point field goals column were affected by this rule. Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount is the only three-point shot era player on this list who did not make a single three-point shot. In the 1986–87 season, the three-point arc was made mandatory in men's basketball, marked at from the center of the basket; at the same time, the three-point arc became an experimental rule in NCAA women's basketball, using the men's distance. In the following season, the men's three-point line became mandatory in women's basketball, and from that point through the 2007–08 season, the three-point lines remained at . On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's basketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the men's three-point line back to ; the women's line remained at the original distance until it was moved to match the men's distance effective in 2011–12. Still later, the NCAA moved the men's three-point line to 6.75 m (22 ft 1.75 in) for the main arc and 6.6 m (21 ft 8 in) in the corners, matching the distance used by the sport's international governing body of FIBA. This last move was implemented in two phases, with Division I adopting the new line in 2019–20 and Divisions II and III doing so in 2020–21. Women's basketball did not adopt the FIBA arc until 2021–22.\nAdditionally, several of the players on this list played during an era when college freshmen were ineligible to compete at the varsity level and competed on either freshman or junior varsity teams. As freshman and junior varsity statistics do not count toward official NCAA records, three players—Pete Maravich, Oscar Robertson and Elvin Hayes—only had three seasons to compile their totals. Larry Bird redshirted (sat out) his freshman year, and therefore, like Maravich, Robertson, and Hayes, his totals were also achieved in only three seasons. Maravich, a guard from LSU, not only owns the three highest single season averages in Division I history, but also the highest career total. Remarkably, he scored 3,667 points in a mere 83 games.\nFour players on this top 25 list are enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Pete Maravich, Oscar Robertson, Elvin Hayes, and Larry Bird.\nAll-time conference scoring leaders.\nThe following list contains current and defunct Division I conferences' all-time scoring leaders. The \"conference founded\" column indicates when each conference first began intercollegiate athletic competition, not necessarily when they began basketball. For example, the Great West Conference was established as a football-only conference in 2004 but became an all-sports conference in 2008 (with basketball actually beginning in 2009–10). Also note that some of the schools on this list are no longer in the conference in which they are identified. Utah, for instance, is currently a member of the Pac-12 Conference, but when Keith Van Horn set the scoring record it was still a member of the Western Athletic Conference. Similarly, BYU is currently in the Big 12 Conference, but the career of its scoring leader Jimmer Fredette coincided with the program's last four seasons in the Mountain West Conference.\nAll-time schools' scoring leaders.\nThese schools are full, current members of NCAA Division I, meaning they have finished the process of joining Division I or its historical equivalent. Some of the records below were set while the school was still in a lower division and are not intended to be solely Division I era scoring records; if no season-specific link exists, it is because the record was set while the school was a member of a lower division. Through 2022–23, the oldest school record is held by Jim Lacy at Loyola of Maryland, whose 2,199 points were last scored in 1949. The newest record holder, meanwhile, is Zach Edey of Purdue, who set his record on March 16, 2024 during his senior season in 2023–24. Lipscomb's John Pierce holds college basketball's all-time, all-divisions scoring mark of 4,230 points. He played from 1990 to 1994 while the Bisons were still a member of the NAIA.\nAll schools are listed with their current athletic brand names, which do not necessarily match those used when a school's scoring leader was active."

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Wales, and at club level for Maesteg RFC, as a fly-half. He played club level rugby league (RL) for Leeds. He also played county cricket for Glamorgan from 1955 to 1971.\nBackground.\nAlan Rees was born in Neath, Glamorgan, Wales.\nInternational honours.\nAlan Rees won three caps for Wales (RU) in 1962 against England, Scotland and France.\nCricket career.\nRees also played cricket for Glamorgan, making 216 first-class appearances between 1955 and 1968. A fine fielder, he appeared as a substitute in the Third Test Match against Australia at Headingley, taking the catch that dismissed Peter Burge off the bowling of Fred Trueman. This appearance makes him one of the few players to have played on both the rugby and cricket grounds at Headingley. In the match against Middlesex at Lord's in 1965, he became only the second player ever to be given out as \"handled the ball\" in the County Championship. In 1970 and 1971, he reappeared in Gillette Cup and John Player league matches.\nLater life.\nAfter his playing career ended, Rees worked as a sports development officer for Afan Borough Council.

A shutout occurs when a single pitcher throws a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a single run.\nWalter Johnson holds the career shutout record with 110. The most shutouts pitched in one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander (1916) and George Bradley (1876). In the dead-ball era and throughout much of the first three-quarters of the twentieth century, starting pitchers were generally expected to perform complete games, and starting pitchers would throw dozens of complete games a year — thereby increasing a pitcher's chances of achieving a shutout. These shutout records are among the most secure records in baseball, as pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with the heavy emphasis on pitch counts and relief pitching. Pitchers today will often pitch only a few, if any, complete games a season. The 2018 season marked a new low for complete-game shutouts; no pitcher threw for more than one shutout during the season, with eleven American League and seven National League pitchers finishing with only one shutout that season.\nAmerican League.\n‡ – \"Denotes a pitcher that led the league in shutouts in their rookie year.\"\nNational League.\n‡ – \"Denotes a pitcher that led the league in shutouts in their rookie year.\"\nNational Association.\n‡ – \"Denotes a pitcher that led the league in shutouts in their rookie year.\""

Development teams have been added to the club's roster as needed and in 2012 the club added the Dukes as a rookie/Single A team in the BBF leagues.\nDue to player and coach departures the top team Richmond Flames, a National League mainstay and multiple champions, was withdrawn from the National Baseball League in 2012, but the club established an official affiliation with Southern Nationals, the three-time National League champions, in 2014.\nFacilities.\nThe club plays its home games at Connare Field in Richmond, named after player Vincent Connare who helped construct and fund the field in 2002 when the club was looking to upgrade its facilities to fit BBF National League standards. The club also has a second diamond on nearby Ham Lands, nicknamed Flood Field due to its proximity to the Thames river.\nTogether with Kew and Ham Football Association, RBSC also shares a clubhouse with multiple changing rooms, full bar and kitchen and a lounge with Wi-Fi and TV.\nConnare Field was completely refurbished in 2014 thanks to a grant from Sport England's Inspired Facilities fund. New dual batting cages were also installed, improving the playing facilities. The club is looking to further improve the playing facilities by adding dugouts and spectator seating.\nHonours.\nThe Flames became the 2006 National Champions by defeating the Croydon Pirates two games to one in the final. The Flames then finished runners up in 2008 and again in 2009 before regaining the National League title in 2010 with a 10-1 victory over the Bracknell Blazers.\nFarm teams the Richmond Knights and Richmond Dragons have had successful seasons, most notably the Knights marathon 20-19 defeat of the Leicester Blue Sox in the 2010 BBF AA Championship Game and the Dragons pennant win in Single A in 2010.\nAfter promoting the Knights to AAA and Dragons to AA in 2011, the club added a new Single A team aimed at rookies; the Richmond Dukes, named after the local history and the location of the field on Dukes Avenue/Riverside Drive.\nIn 2013, only the second year of existence for the Dukes, they overcame a slow start to win the Single A National Championship.\nManagement.\nThe club elects the club management every year at the Annual General Meeting, normally held in the off-season. The current committee consists of:\nFormer board members:"

        "title": "Detroit Golf Club",
        "text": "The Detroit Golf Club (abbreviated to DGC) is a private golf club located in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan in the middle of a neighborhood area on north side of the city near the University of Detroit Mercy and Palmer Woods Historic District. Bert Way designed the original 6-hole course. It was expanded to 9 holes, and finally Donald Ross built the current 36-hole course. The club grounds crew maintains two courses, the North and the South Course. The head pro is Josh Upson. Starting in 2019, Detroit Golf Club began hosting the Rocket Mortgage Classic, a new annual PGA Tour event.\nHistory.\nThe Detroit Golf Club was founded in 1899 by William R. Farrand and several of his friends. Originally the club was limited to 100 members. They rented a plot of farmland at 6 Mile and Woodward, and a 6-hole course layout was created. In 1900 the course added 3 holes, making it a 9-hole course. The membership was increased to 200 in 1902. At that time of land were purchased at 6 Mile and Hamilton, and an 18-hole course was developed.\nIn 1906 the club was formally opened, and membership fees were raised to $250. In 1913 additional property was bought, and Donald Ross was asked to survey the property. Ross determined that two courses of 18 holes could be built on the land. Horace Rackham paid $100,000 for the 36-hole course to be built to the DGC at a cost.\nIn 1916 Albert Kahn started construction on a new clubhouse, which was completed in 1918. The brother of Donald Ross, Alec Ross, became Club Professional, a position he held until 1945, a total of 31 years.\nIn 1922 club membership was increased to 650, and they decided to stay open year round. In 1929 the Fred Wardell Caddy House was built, at a cost around $40,000.\nDuring World War II, Club activities were limited due to gas rationing, and in 1945, Alex Ross retired as Club Professional. Golf star Horton Smith was hired as the Club Pro, and in 1959 was elected into the Professional Golfers Association Hall of Fame. In 1963 Smith died, and Walter Burkemo was hired.\nThe club added new amenities: tennis courts, a cart garage, and a crystal dining room. Burkemo was succeeded by George Bayer. The current club pro is Josh Upson. The club also contains a pool for members, and sponsors a swim team.\nLocation.\nThe club, located on the North side of Detroit, near such landmarks as Palmer Park and the University of Detroit Mercy, is separated from the former Palmer Park Golf Course by Pontchartrain Blvd. on the East, and Fairway Drive on the West. It shares a small border with 7 Mile on the North, and a large border with McNichols (6 Mile) on the South.\nClub Tournaments.\nMen's\nWomen's\nCouple's\nFamily Golf Events\nChanges for the PGA Tour Event\nOn October 11, 2010, the Detroit Golf Club bid for the Rocket Mortgage Classic on the PGA Tour. The event has been hosted on the North course from 2019 through 2022. To prepare several of the holes were lengthened, and trees around the greens and tee boxes have also been removed. Parking is made available in the adjacent Palmer Park and the surrounding area, with the University of Detroit Mercy and the Michigan State Fairgrounds serving as other possible parking locations. In 2022, Detroit Golf Club announced golf architect Tyler Rae would look at drainage improvements. \nCourses.\nBoth courses have a snack shack next to a combined tee. The 13th for the South and the 14th for the North. Water hazards can be found on the North and South. Both courses are also bordered by beautiful houses that belong to many notable residents such as Jerome Bettis, Aretha Franklin, John Conyers. and many more. \nNorth Course.\nThe North Course is longer than the South by 870 yards. According to the original Donald Ross design, the 8th tee should be the 1st tee, and the 7th tee should be the 9th. Distinctive features include the bent tree between the 7th and 8th hole. As a sapling, Native Americans bent the tree to serve as a marker for the original Indian Trail between Detroit and Pontiac. The original clubhouse was situated where the 12th green is today, pipes can still be seen a distance behind the green.\nSouth Course.\nThe South Course has two combined tees. The 3rd and 9th, and the 5th and the 8th. The 10th tee is the most elevated at the DGC. In the early 1980s, the 13th tee was combined with the 14th tee on the North in front of the shack."

        "text": "The Harvard Crimson men's basketball program represents intercollegiate men's basketball at Harvard University. The team currently competes in the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and plays home games at the Lavietes Pavilion in Boston, Massachusetts. The Crimson are currently coached by Tommy Amaker.\nHistory.\nTommy Amaker era.\nOn April 11, 2007, Tommy Amaker was named men's basketball coach at Harvard University. On January 7, 2009, Amaker's Harvard squad defeated then-ranked Boston College (#17 AP Poll/#24 Coaches' Poll) for the first win over a ranked team in the program's history. The following season, after Amaker coached Harvard to its most successful season ever behind the play of Jeremy Lin, the 2009–10 team was invited to participate in the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament. The team was defeated in the first round by Appalachian State.\nAmaker led the 2010-11 team to a share of the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season championship, which was school's first men's basketball Ivy League Championship since the league was formed during the 1956–57 season. Harvard finished the season a perfect 14–0 at home, which surpassed the prior season's school record of eleven home wins. The team's 12 conference game wins established a school record. The team's victory over Colorado was the team's first ever against a Big 12 Conference opponent since that conference commenced play in 1996. His fourth season also marked the fourth straight season that the team defeated at least one power conference opponent. By finishing as Ivy League Co-champion, they faced Princeton in a one-game playoff and lost by a score of 63–62. Harvard earned an automatic bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, but was defeated by by a 71–54 margin in the first round. The final record of 23–7 surpassed the prior season's total of 21 wins for the most in the history of the program.\nThe team appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2014, where Harvard upset 5-seed Cincinnati 61–57 before being eliminated in the round of 32 by 4-seed Michigan State by a score of 80–73. In 2015, Harvard tied with Yale for the Ivy title with an 11–3 league record. Despite having lost to Yale 62–52 at Lavietes Pavilion on March 6, 2015, just eight days later Harvard won a playoff between the two at the Palestra in Philadelphia to determine the Ivy League's NCAA automatic bid by a score of 53–51. Harvard thereby achieved its fourth straight NCAA tournament appearance while extending Yale's 53-year NCAA tournament appearance drought. Harvard was eliminated from the 2015 NCAA tournament by UNC by a score of 67–65 after leading with under one minute to play in the game. \nHarvard stood at 10-4 in the Ivy league during the 2019-2020 season when the remainder of the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis. The entire 2020-2021 Ivy League men's basketball season was cancelled due to the continuing COVID-19 crisis. \nAt the conclusion of the 2021-2022 season, Amaker's record at Harvard stood at 264-152.\nFinancial aid and recruiting.\nAnother key to Harvard's recent success in basketball has been a 2006 change in the school's financial aid policy. Although the Ivy League strictly prohibits athletic scholarships, Harvard has adopted an aid scheme that makes the school far more accessible to low- and middle-income students. Under current policy, all students (not just athletes) from families with annual incomes less than $180,000 pay at most 10% of family income, and those with family incomes under $60,000 receive full scholarships. According to Jay Hart of Yahoo! Sports,With the financial barrier to entry lifted, an offer to play basketball at Harvard became instantly competitive with the rest of the world of collegiate athletics, where full-ride scholarships are (purportedly) the only currency.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Crimson have appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament five times. Their combined record is 2–6. Until their appearance in the Tournament in 2012, they had gone 66 years without making an appearance, the longest drought in NCAA history. \nNIT results.\nThe Crimson have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament three times. Their combined record is 1–3.\nCIT results.\nThe Crimson have appeared in the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament once. Their record is 0–1.\nNotable players.\nCrimson in the National Basketball Association.\nBold denotes active player."

They achieved their first and so far only victory at the World Cup in 2010, when they beat Algeria 1–0 with a goal by Robert Koren.\nOverall record.\nFrom 1930 to 1990, Slovenia did not compete at the World Cup as the country was part of Yugoslavia. Since their independence in 1991, Slovenia have qualified for two World Cups and was eliminated in the group stage on both occasions.\n2002 FIFA World Cup.\nSlovenia qualified for their first World Cup in 2002 under the management of Srečko Katanec. They suffered a 3–1 defeat to Spain in their opening game. Katanec's decision to substitute midfielder Zlatko Zahovič led to an argument that ended with Zahovič being expelled from the team and sent home, and Katanec announced his intention to resign as manager after the tournament. Slovenia lost their second game 1–0 to South Africa, leaving them unable to qualify from the group. The side's final game ended in a 3–1 defeat to Paraguay.\n2010 FIFA World Cup.\nSlovenia were the smallest country in terms of population to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. Under the management of Matjaž Kek, the team qualified for the tournament by winning the two-legged playoff against Russia, despite losing the first leg. Slovenia beat Algeria 1–0 in their opening game, securing their first ever World Cup victory, and drew 2–2 with the United States. This meant that the side only needed a draw in their final group game against England to reach the knockout stage. However, a 1–0 loss to England and a United States victory over Algeria saw Slovenia finish third in the group and fail to advance.\nPlayer records.\nMost appearances.\nSlovenia's 2010 squad did not feature a single player from the 2002 tournament, so no player had the chance to play more than three World Cup matches for Slovenia.\nGoalscorers.\nFive Slovenian players scored one goal each at FIFA World Cups."

        "text": "The 2011 Major League Baseball season began on Thursday, March 31, and ended on Wednesday, September 28. This marked the first time a season began on a Thursday since 1976, and the first time a regular season ended on a Wednesday since 1990. The 82nd edition of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona, on July 12 with the National League defeating the American League for the second straight year, by a score of 5–1. As had been the case since 2003, the league winning that game had home field advantage in the World Series. Accordingly, the World Series began on October 19, and ended on October 28, with the St. Louis Cardinals winning in seven games over the Texas Rangers.\nThe season is notable for its wild card chase on the last day of the regular season.\nOnly two teams were unable to complete the entire 162-game regular season schedule, as the make-up game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park on September 8 was cancelled due to rain and not made up, owing to scheduling constraints and the game being inconsequential to the playoffs.\nManagerial changes.\nField managers.\nOff-season.\nFour teams announced new managers for the 2011 season after the former manager retired from baseball.\nAt the end of the 2010 season, three teams fired their managers and made replacements:\nThe following managers who were interim managers for 2010 will lead their respective teams in 2011:\nOne team has hired a new manager:\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nTwo more teams joined the growing cable-exclusive telecast teams in 2011. Fox Sports Midwest produced and televised all St. Louis Cardinals games on the cable station, along with selected areas of the Cardinals' DMA outside St. Louis including Fox Sports Tennessee in Tennessee, Fox Sports Indiana in parts of Indiana, and SportsSouth in Arkansas and parts of Oklahoma. The 2010 season was their last season of splitting games with KSDK.\nThe Minnesota Twins also joined the group, with Fox Sports North becoming their exclusive local home. The 2010 season was their last season of splitting games with WFTC.\nAtlanta Braves games that aired on WPCH-TV were produced by and simulcast on Fox Sports South or SportSouth, marking the first season since 1972 which local Braves telecasts weren't produced by Turner Sports.\nThe national telecast breakdown is as follows, along with the maximum number of appearances per team:\nIn Canada, Toronto Blue Jays games were televised on Rogers Sportsnet, which also held the Canadian rights to air the Fox and ESPN/ESPN2 games if they did not conflict with Blue Jays' games, and additional regular season games on a regional basis on Rogers Sportsnet One as well as the All-Star Game and the entire postseason. TSN2 held rights to the ESPN Sunday Night Baseball telecasts.\nIn Australia, it was free to air channel One HD and showed up to five games live per week, and European channel ESPN America broadcast games as well.\nFor international viewers, MLB International broadcast the All-Star Game, the NLCS and the World Series.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio served as MLB's national radio network, broadcasting \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as selected Saturday and holiday games during the regular season, the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game, and all postseason series. ESPN Deportes Radio held the Spanish language rights to the Fall Classic.\nAngels' 50th anniversary.\nThe Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim celebrated their 50th Anniversary in 2011. Founded by Gene Autry in 1961, the team played at Los Angeles' Wrigley Field in their first season, then shared Dodger Stadium (called \"Chavez Ravine\" by Angels management) with the Dodgers before moving to Anaheim in 1966 and their own stadium, Anaheim Stadium (later to become Edison International Field of Anaheim and finally Angel Stadium of Anaheim). That year, the team name was altered to the California Angels. After being purchased by The Walt Disney Company in 1997, the team name was changed to the Anaheim Angels and after Arte Moreno purchased the team, the name was changed to its current moniker to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2005. For the season, in addition to the patch, the Angels changed the color of the halo from silver to gold on their uniforms, just as it looked from 1971 through 1996. In addition, on selected Friday night games, the team donned replicas of five of the six styles of uniforms they have worn, the most notable omission being that of the \"Periwinkle Blue\" era from 1997 to 2001, when Disney owned the team.\nStadiums.\nThis was the Florida Marlins' final season at Sun Life Stadium, after 19 years, they moved to their new ballpark in downtown Miami, where they became the Miami Marlins.\nVenue changes.\nDue to the U2 360° Tour concert scheduled June 29 at Sun Life Stadium and the needed time to set up the stage, the Marlins were forced to move their scheduled home games for June 24–26 against the Seattle Mariners to the Mariners' park at Safeco Field. As the Marlins were the home team, NL rules (no designated hitter) were applied. Mariners and Marlins did not meet again in Miami until 2014.\nTeam purchases.\nThe Houston Astros were sold by Drayton McLane for US $680 million to a group led by Jim Crane, the founder of a transit logistics company.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Detroit Tigers retired Sparky Anderson's No. 11 on June 26.\nBert Blyleven, elected to the Class of 2011 of the Baseball Hall of Fame, was honored with the retirement of his uniform No. 28 by the Twins on July 16.\nRoberto Alomar, also a 2011 Hall of Fame class member, became the first member of the Toronto Blue Jays to have his number (#12) retired on July 31.\nThe Atlanta Braves retired Bobby Cox's No. 6 prior to their game against the Chicago Cubs on August 12.\nTrevor Hoffman, who had been the all-time saves leader until Mariano Rivera surpassed him on September 19, had his No. 51 retired by the San Diego Padres on August 21."

        "text": "The Tucuman Rugby Union () or URT is the organisational body that controls the game of rugby union in the province of Tucumán, Argentina.\nHistory.\nRugby was first played in Tucumán in 1915, when British enthusiasts that worked at the local sugarmills meet to play the game in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán. Nevertheless, the first official rugby team in the province –from the Club Natación y Gimnasia– would not be formed in 1936. Six years later Tucumán Rugby Club was founded, followed by Universitario Rugby Club de Tucumán in 1943 and * Cardenales in 1944. Those four clubs would go on to found the \"Unión de Rugby del Norte\" on 29 February 1944.\nAlthough the URN was based in Tucumán Province it also dealt with fledgling clubs from the neighbouring provinces of Salta, Jujuy and Santiago del Estero. Later these provinces would go on to form their own unions: Unión de Rugby de Salta in 1951, Unión Jujeña de Rugby in 1966 and Unión Santiagueña de Rugby in 1968. After that the Unión de Rugby del Norte became simply known as the Unión de Rugby de Tucumán and only dealt with clubs from Tucumán Province.\nProvincial side.\nThe URT was represented by its own team in Campeonato Argentino, a now defunct competition in which each of the 24 unions that make up the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) participated.\nClub competitions.\nEleven member clubs are affiliated with the Union and take part in the union's provincial competitions. They also compete in the annual Torneo del Norte, a regional competition that also includes teams from the neighboring unions of Salta, Santiago del Estero and Jujuy.\nClubs from Tucumán have enjoyed some success in the national club tournament with Tucumán Rugby Club reaching the final twice in 1993 and 2007, and Los Tarcos Rugby Club once in 2004.\nTorneo del Noroeste.\nTucumán clubs take part in the Torneo del Noroeste (or simply Torneo del NOA), along with teams from Salta, Jujuy and Santiago del Estero.\nThe Noroeste tournament has traditionally been dominated by clubs from Tucumán, clubs from the other 3 provinces have yet to win a title. The most successful teams are Universitario and Tucumán Rugby Club with 21 and 20 titles respectively.\nEvery year, the best ranked teams from the Noroeste go on to play in the annual Torneo del Interior, where they meet teams from the country's other regional tournaments: Litoral, Centro, Noreste, Pampeana, Oeste and Patagónico.\nThe two finalists of the Interior then go on to meet the two finalists of the Buenos Aires League in the Nacional de Clubes competition.\nSo far, two clubs from Tucumán have reached the final of the Nacional: Tucumán RC in 1993 and 2007 and Los Tarcos in 2004. However, both clubs lost and a Tucumán club has yet to win the national title.\nLocal competitions.\nLike all other provincial unions, the URT organises local competitions for underage and reserve teams."

        "text": "Donald Roberts (May 27, 1933 – July 24, 2016) was an American college men's ice hockey coach. From 1964 to 1997, he was the head hockey coach at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota. At the time of his retirement in 1996, he was the winningest hockey coach in NCAA Division III history. He received the John MacInnes Award from the American Hockey Coaches Association in 1993 and the Hobey Baker Legends of College Hockey Award in 2009. As of 2010, he ranks 15th all-time among college men's ice hockey coaches with 532 wins.\nEarly years.\nRoberts grew up in Appleton, Minnesota, where he was a star basketball player. He enrolled at Gustavus Adolphus College in the early 1950s and played four years at halfback and fullback on the school's varsity football team under Coach Lloyd Hollingsworth. He played on three Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championship football teams and was selected as an All-MIAC fullback in 1955. He also played basketball and baseball, but not hockey, while he was a student at Gustavus.\nAfter college, Roberts served for three-and-a-half years in the United States Marine Corps, reaching the rank of captain. While stationed at Camp Pendleton in California, Roberts began coaching baseball and football. Roberts later recalled, \"There is no greater place to learn about leadership than in the Corps.\"\nIn 1959, Roberts was offered a position as a teacher and coach at Gustavus. He returned to Gustavus in the fall of 1959 and became the school's wrestling coach. After the 1960 football season, Lloyd Hollingsworth resigned, and Roberts was appointed as the new head football coach. He stepped down as the school's wrestling coach in 1962 to focus on the football program. He was the head football coach at Gustavus for five seasons from 1961 to 1965.\nGustavus hockey coach.\nIn 1964, several schools in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (\"MIAC\") decided to add hockey to the conference's sports programs. Though he had never played or coached hockey before in his life, Roberts was appointed as the school's hockey coach. He later recalled, \"I didn't have a winter sport, so I was the new hockey coach. The story was that I couldn't skate. Actually, I had skated occasionally on the Pomme de Terre River growing up in Appleton. We played some shinny hockey, using a pop can as a puck.\" He also recalled the teasing he received about his unsteadiness on ice skates: \"On skates, I was a 30-year-old mite. I would stumble a lot. I started coaching in boots. The players would laugh at me. I was a good handball player. If someone laughed too hard, he had to play me in handball.\"\nIn an effort to learn the basics of the sport, Roberts bought a book by Dartmouth College coach Eddie Jeremiah. Thirty years later, he said of Jeremiah's book, \"It's still the best teaching manual ever about hockey.\"\nIn Roberts' first year as a hockey coach, the 1965 team finished with a record of 1-14. However, Roberts compiled a 16-2 record and won an MIAC championship in 1966. From 1966 to 1978, Roberts' hockey teams compiled a record of 235-64-1 and won 12 of 13 MIAC conference championships.\nRoberts also served as the chairman and president of the American Hockey Coaches Association and was a member of the NCAA Rules and Hockey Advisory Committees for many years.\nCareer record and honors.\nIn 33 years as the head coach at Gustavus, Roberts compiled a record of 532 wins, 290 losses and 25 ties. At the time of his retirement in 1996, he ranked first in career wins in NCAA Division III history. As of 2010, he ranks 16th all-time among college men's ice hockey coaches with 532 wins. Roberts has been the recipient of many awards for his accomplishments and contributions to college hockey. His awards include the following:\nPersonal life.\nRoberts lived with his wife, Nancy Roberts, in St. Peter, Minnesota. They have four grown children, two of whom played football for Gustavus. He died at the age of 83 on July 24, 2016."

        "text": "William Eldon Tucker CVO MBE TD (6 August 1903 – 4 August 1991) was a Bermudian rugby union player who played club rugby for Cambridge University, St. George's Hospital and Blackheath. Tucker gained his first of three international caps when he was selected for England in 1926. Tucker was a notable orthopaedic surgeon, specialising in sports injuries. He also had a long career in the Territorial Army section of the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was decorated for his Second World War service, much of which was spent in German POW camps having remained with the wounded in France during the Dunkirk evacuation.\nPersonal history.\nWilliam Eldon Tucker was born in Hamilton, Bermuda, in 1903 to William Eldon Tucker and Henrietta Hutchings. His father was a medical doctor, and Tucker's life would follow his father's closely in professional and sporting areas. Tucker was educated at Sherborne School in England, before matriculating to Caius College, Cambridge. After leaving Cambridge he continued his education at St George's Hospital, London; where he gained his MRCS and LRCP in 1928. On 1 November 1930 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Territorial Army (TA) General List of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), He transferred to the TA Reserve of Officers on 8 February 1934. In 1936, at the age of 33, he opened the Park Street Orthopaedic Clinic, where he pioneered treatment in sports' injuries, stimulated by his experiences as a rugby player.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War imminent, Tucker returned to the RAMC TA General List, and was promoted to captain on 12 April 1939. He was called up for active service when the TA was mobilised. He was captured by German forces early in the conflict, when he chose to remain behind to treat injured soldiers, during the Dunkirk evacuation. As a prisoner of war he made himself useful by constructing improvised artificial limbs for injured soldiers. After his repatriation from Germany, he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire on 3 February 1944, \"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services during and prior to captivity.\" After the war, while retaining his TA commission, he returned to work at his London Clinic, and through focusing on injuries to sportsmen and women, it became a very successful business. Tucker elected to keep his clinic open seven days a week, therefore becoming a first port of call for sportspeople injured during weekend sporting events, this was very popular with jockeys who required to return to racing as soon as possible for economic reasons. Tucker's clients were notable and included famous cricketers, footballers and members of the British Royal family.\nTucker's TA career continued in parallel, he was promoted major on 15 August 1947, and concurrently granted the acting rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1950, the rank of lt-col was confirmed, backdated to his original acting promotion. On 16 February 1951 he was awarded the Territorial Efficiency Decoration, with clasp for his long-service in the TA, and was promoted acting colonel on 1 June 1951, substantive promotion followed early the next year, again backdated to the original assumption of acting rank. He was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1954 New Year Honours. He transferred back to the TA Reserve of Officers on 1 July 1956.\nIn 1956, Tucker, along with Arthur Porritt and Sir Adolphe Abrahams gathered a group interested in sport and medicine, which became the British Association of Sport and Medicine. On 24 July 1960 he was appointed Honorary Colonel of 17 (London) General Hospital, RAMC, TA, holding the position until 1 December 1963. During this period he reached the age limit for service, and so retired from the TA Reserve of Officers on 6 August 1961.\nTucker wrote several books on health and fitness, including \"Young at Heart\", an advice book for remaining fit in old age. On his retirement he left Britain and returned to his family home in Bermuda. He was married twice, and had two children from his first marriage.\nRugby career.\nTucker first came to note as a rugby player when he played for Cambridge University. He played in four Varsity Matches from 1922 to 1925, and he was given the captaincy in the 1925 match. Tucker was described as a 'fine forward' and a 'sanguine, forceful and cheerful personality. During the 1925/26 season, Tucker was given his first international cap, when he was selected for England during the 1926 Five Nations Championship. The match, played against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, ended in a 19–15 victory for the Irish team. After leaving Cambridge, Tucker played for St George's Hospital and then Blackheath, as well as being selected to play county rugby for Kent. Tucker needed to wait until 1930 to play for England again, and played two games in the 1930 Championship, a win over Wales and another loss to Ireland.\nTucker's rugby career is closely linked to that of his father. Not only did the two men share the same name, William Eldon Tucker, but both were educated at Caius College in Cambridge, before completing a medical education at St George's Hospital. At Cambridge, both men played for the University rugby club, and were also honoured by captaining the team during a Varsity Match.&lt;ref name=\"BMJ 7/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both men played for St George's RFC, Blackheath and played county rugby for Kent. A more difficult feat was achieved when both were chosen to represent England at international level and being chosen to play for invitational touring side, the Barbarians."

The Czech Republic defeated the favored Russian team 2–1.\nBackground.\nThe final was the first gold medal game between Russia and the Czech Republic in the history of the tournament. Before, they faced each other at the 1998 Winter Olympics, where the Czechs defeated the Russians in the gold medal game. In addition, the predecessors of both these nations, the USSR and Czechoslovakia, had met several times in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\nIt was Russia's third consecutive finals appearance, and the Czech Republic's first appearance since 2006.\nVenue.\nThe Lanxess Arena in Cologne was determined to host the finalists of the tournament. Previously at the tournament, the venue hosted the two semi-finals, and also the Bronze medal match. In the final, the attendance was 19,132.\nThe match.\nSummary.\nThe match began with a goal after just 20 seconds, scored by Jakub Klepiš from a pass by Jaromír Jágr. The goal was seemingly the result of a defensive mistake which led to a Czech offensive possession with Russian defensemen out of position. For the remainder of the period the Russians held almost complete possession of the puck, and veteran Sergei Fedorov hit the post after an odd man rush. Very late in the period the Russians put the puck in the net on a power play, but it was determined to be after the clock had run out and was ruled as no goal. There was some brief confusion however, as the buzzer sounds after the clock on the scoreboard runs out.\nIn the second period Russia pressed once again but the Czech Republic slowed the game down and forced Russia to regroup, resulting in an error in the Russian defensive zone when Alexander Ovechkin collided with teammate Fedorov. This led to a 3-on-2 rush for the Czechs and Karel Rachůnek centered the puck while Tomáš Rolinek crashed the net. The puck was redirected off Rolinek's skates, and it was ruled a good goal because there was no kicking motion visible.\nThe third period began with more Russian pressure, including a close chance off the post by Evgeni Malkin, but at the midway point of the period Russian Alexei Emelin was given a five-minute major and thrown out of the game for clipping Jaromír Jágr, who did not return for the remainder of the game. This was followed by more penalty trouble for both teams. In the final minutes after pulling goaltender Semyon Varlamov, Pavel Datsyuk buried a goal on a 5-on-3 with 35 seconds left, bringing Russia within one goal of the Czechs. Under pressure the Czech goalie Tomáš Vokoun managed to stave off the final Russian assault and the Czechs held on to win the game 2–1.\nAftermath.\nThe president of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus handed out the gold medals alongside IIHF president René Fasel. It was the sixth title for the Czech Republic, and first after 2005."

As a senior in 1939–40, Harvey became the first Buffaloes basketball player to earn a Consensus All-American distinction when he garnered a Second Team accolade. He had also been recognized as a First Team All-American in 1939, although he was not a consensus selection. Harvey led the Buffaloes to two conference championships and a trip to the NCAA tournament his senior season. During his junior and senior years, Colorado posted a 31–8 record and spent some time as the #1 team in the country.\nNo records of Harvey's scoring and rebounding statistics have ever been found. He was known as a tenacious defender, however, which is probably a leading cause for his All-American distinction in 1939 and 1940.\nIn 1942, Harvey helped lead the Denver American Legion of the AAU to a national championship by defeating the Phillips 66ers 45–32.\nHarvey died on November 21, 1981, at age 63."

        "title": "2010 FIFA World Cup event effects",
        "text": "The 2010 FIFA World Cup is the 19th FIFA World Cup, the premier international association football tournament, being held in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July. It is the first time the finals of the tournament have been staged in an African host nation as South Africa were selected as hosts following a bidding in 2004. The impact of the event itself transcend those bound by its athletic aspect and appeal, and the socioeconomic aspects of the tournament are far reaching.\nSocial effects.\nSecurity.\nTournament organiser Danny Jordaan dismissed concerns that the attack on the Togo national team which took place in Angola in January 2010, had any relevance to the security arrangements for the World Cup. There have been claims that the police have implemented a \"de facto\" state of emergency by banning protests during the event.\nMajor General Qassim al-Moussawi of Iraq's security services said the arrest of Abdullah Azzam Saleh al-Qahtani, allegedly a former Saudi army lieutenant, yielded information that \"He was planning a terrorist act in South Africa during the World Cup based on plans issued by the central al Qaeda terrorist organisation in coordination with Osama bin Laden's first assistant, Ayman al-Zawahri.\"\nThere were also reports of thefts against visitors to the country for the World Cup. Tourists from China, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Japan and Colombia had become victim to crimes. Three members of the Greece national team reported that £1,300 had been stolen from their rooms. These reports came after the British media cautioned visitors about such security threats.\nIn Iraq, the improved security situation has allowed people to watch matches in public places. This is in contrast to 2006 when violence prevented people from gathering publicly. Radical militant groups in Somalia have banned the watching of televised World Cup matches, and had initially threatened to punish with public floggings, declaring the World Cup a waste of time and resources and un-Islamic. There were reports that groups had arrested people for watching the World Cup. The group denied reports of arresting people, but said that they were chasing people out of video halls.\nOn 18 June after the match between England and Algeria a fan was able to break through the FIFA-appointed security staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room. The breach took place shortly after Prince William and Prince Harry had left the room. The trespasser was then released before he could be handed over to the Police. The Football Association lodged a formal complaint with FIFA and demanded that security be increased.\nEvictions.\nAs with many 'hallmark events' throughout the world, the 2010 FIFA World Cup has been connected to evictions, which many claim are meant to 'beautify the city', impress visiting tourists, and hide shackdwellers. On 14 May 2009, the Durban-based shack-dwellers' movement Abahlali baseMjondolo took the KwaZulu-Natal government to court over their controversial Elimination and Prevention of Re-Emergence of Slums Act, meant to eliminate slums in South Africa and put homeless shackdwellers in transit camps in time for the 2010 World Cup. They have gained a lot of publicity for their efforts, even in the international media. Abahlali baseMjondolo have threatened to build shacks outside of the Cape Town stadium to draw attention to their situation.\nAnother prominent controversy surrounding preparations for the World Cup is the N2 Gateway housing project in Cape Town, which plans to remove over 20,000 residents from the Joe Slovo Informal Settlement along the busy N2 Freeway and build rental flats and bond-houses in its place in time for the 2010 World Cup. The residents would be moved to the poverty stricken Delft township on the outskirts of the city and out of sight from the N2 Freeway. There has been particular concern about forced removals to the Blikkiesdorp camp in Delft and that in Durban, children are being forcibly removed from the city centre.\nIn July 2009, South Africa was hit with rolling protests by poor communities that demanded access to basic services, jobs, adequate housing and the democratisation of service delivery. These protests have been linked to the World Cup as protesters complain that public funds are being diverted away from social issues to build stadiums and upgrade airports. Fears have been expressed that the growing protests by shack dwellers could result in the tournament being disrupted. Some grassroots social movements have called for a boycott of the event.\nBlikkiesdorp.\nBlikkiesdorp has become well known for its high crime rate, its substandard living conditions, and its extremely hot or cold, windy and sandy living environment. NGOs, international human rights organisations, and the Anti-Eviction Campaign have publicly criticised the conditions in Blikkiesdorp and how they say it is used to reinforce the eviction of poor families especially to make way for the 2010 World Cup. Residents also threatened to burn down Blikkiesdorp before the World Cup begins because of the bad conditions in the settlement.\nXenophobic Violence.\nThere were widespread reports in the local press that there would be mass planned violence against migrants at the conclusion of the tournament. This did not happen.\nHIV/AIDS.\nSouth Africans and others expressed concern that the World Cup would stimulate the illicit sex trade. Football fans were warned that South Africa has one of the worst HIV infection rates in the world with up to half the country's sex workers HIV positive and the British government gave to buy condoms. However, AIDS campaigners accused FIFA of blocking the distribution of condoms at football grounds.\nEconomic effects.\nNon-FIFA events.\nIn November 2009 it was reported that a rugby mid-year Test match between the Springboks and France scheduled to take place in Cape Town on 12 June 2010 would be moved to Europe, due to FIFA regulations banning other sport events in host cities during the time of the World Cup. After negotiations between the South African Rugby Union and members of the local organising committee, it was announced that the Test would be allowed to take place in Cape Town on the originally scheduled date because no World Cup match was to be played in Cape Town on that day, and the Test would be played at Newlands, which is not a World Cup venue.\nFIFA trademarks.\nThe South African low-fare airline Kulula.com were ordered by FIFA to withdraw an advertisement that it claimed infringed their trademarks. The advert, titled \"The unofficial carrier of the you-know-what\", features soccer balls, vuvuzelas and the flag of South Africa, which FIFA claims when used in conjunction with each other constitutes an infringement of its trademarks. Kulula.com disputed FIFA's claim, but later announced that they would withdraw the specific advert whilst continuing with the advertisement campaign.\nBroadcast rights and fees.\nIn Singapore, FIFA's broadcast rights fees for the 2010 World Cup finals have been described as \"exorbitant\", with the organisation having changed prices according to what it perceived the country's TV operators were willing to pay. When Singapore TV operators SingTel and Starhub joined together to bid for the broadcast rights in late 2009, they were reportedly charged an initial (about ). When the Singapore TV operators refused to pay the initial sum quoted by FIFA, and as time passed, Singapore was faced with the prospect of being one of the few countries not to get match broadcasts from the 2010 World Cup.\nWith only about a month left before the tournament, FIFA finally relented and reportedly reduced the fee to (), which was then accepted by the Singapore TV operators. This reduced fee was still significantly higher than the fee that FIFA charged Starhub for the exclusive rights to broadcast the 2006 World Cup in Germany, which was reported to be ().\nThis increased fee for the 2010 World Cup tournament broadcast rights resulted in the Singapore TV operators passing on the cost to their subscribers, which were then charged a special fee of S$94 (US$68) in addition to existing contracts, to watch the tournament's games. This high additional fee was the most expensive in the region, and angered Singapore football fans. Singapore was more expensive when compared to countries in the region that will either be broadcasting the matches free of charge, as in the case of Indonesia and Thailand; or at significantly lower viewing fees, at US$21 in Malaysia and US$38 in Hong Kong. This fee is also almost four times the S$25 (US$18) special fee that Starhub charged its subscribers for viewing the 2006 World Cup finals matches in Germany. As a result, many fans decided to protest against the increased fees with a mass boycott of the 2010 World Cup broadcast service by both operators.\nLocal vendors.\nLocal vendors were prohibited from selling food and merchandise within a 1.5 km radius of any stadium hosting a World Cup Match. For a vendor to operate within the radius a registration fee of 60,000 South African Rand, equivalent to 7,888 US dollars, had to be paid FIFA. This fee was out of most local vendors' reach, as they are simple one-man-operated vendors. This prevented international visitors from experiencing local South African food. Some local vendors felt cheated out an opportunity of financial gain and spreading South African culture, in favour of multinational corporations.\nMatch effects.\nVuvuzelas.\nDuring the World Cup events many competitors have criticised and complained about the noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France's Patrice Evra who blamed the horns for the team's poor performance. He also claimed that the sound of the vuvuzelas away from the stadiums hampered the ability of the players to get their rest. Other critics include Lionel Messi who complained that the sound of the vuvuzelas hampered communication among players on the pitch, and broadcasting companies, which complained that commentators' voices were being drowned out by the sound. Cristiano Ronaldo went on record to state that the sound of the vuvuzelas disturbed the teams' concentration.\nOthers watching on television have complained that the ambient audio feed from the stadium only contains the sounds of the vuvuzelas and the natural sounds of people in the stands are drowned out. A spokesperson for the ESPN network said it was taking steps to minimize the noise of the crowd on its broadcasts. Portuguese telecommunications company Portugal Telecom announced on 16 June an offer of an alternative audio feed, in which the vuvuzela sound is edited out, to the customers of its Pay-TV service called MEO.\nWhen asked a few days into the tournament whether consideration would be given to banning vuvuzelas during matches, South African organising chief Danny Jordaan replied, \"if there are grounds to do so, yes\" and that \"if any land on the pitch in anger we will take action.\"\nTicketing and attendance.\nSome first-round games suffered from large blocks of unoccupied stands, including one match with nearly 11,000 empty seats. FIFA reported that group ticket purchases went unused, and that current attendance levels were in fact second only to the 1994 event during the early round period."

He is currently an assistant coach for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nAllen started his career with the Troy Sabres of the All-American Hockey League in 1986. He was then traded to the Carolina Thunderbirds during the 1986–87 season. Allen stayed with the team for four seasons as they made their move from the AAHL to the ECHL and changed their name from the Carolina Thunderbirds to the Winston-Salem Thunderbirds. During the 1988–89 ECHL season, Allen played slightly under fourteen minutes as a goaltender for the Carolina Thunderbirds, giving up 3 goals on 10 shots. GAA of 13.26 with a save percentage of .700.\nAllen was traded to the Erie Panthers at the beginning of the 1989–90 season and finished the season as a member of the Greensboro Monarchs.

Allen would play six games for the Cincinnati Cyclones during the 1990–91 season before leaving for the Colonial Hockey League in 1991–92. Allen would retire from hockey in 1996.\nCoaching career.\nAllen joined the Johnstown Chiefs as an assistant to head coach Nick Fotiu prior to the 1996–97 ECHL season. The team went 24–39–0–7 in Allen's first year as an assistant coach. Fotiu and Allen returned to the Chiefs' bench for the 1997–98 season. The Chiefs started their season 4–20–6 (.233), and Fotiu was fired from the team after 30 games. Allen assumed the duties as head coach for the remainder of the season, where the team showed improvement by going 17–21–2 (.450) over the last 40 games. The Chiefs went 27–34–0–9 in 1998–99 matching the previous season's win percentage of .450. The 1999–00 season was the start of a three-year run where the Chiefs advanced deep into the playoffs.

        "title": "2008 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final",
        "text": " \nThe 2008 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the men's singles tournament at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships. A part of the storied Federer–Nadal rivalry, it pitted then-top ranked Roger Federer against then second-ranked Rafael Nadal. After 4 hours and 48 minutes of play, Nadal defeated Federer 6–4, 6–4, 6–7(5–7), 6–7(8–10), 9–7. This final is regarded by many as one of the greatest tennis matches ever played.\nBackground.\nBetween 2004 &amp; 2019, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal had a storied rivalry that many contemporaries considered to be the greatest in tennis history and, retrospectively, the most iconic. As they entered the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, the two men had combined to win 14 of the previous 16 Grand Slam titles (12:4 in favour of Federer).\nThe 2008 final was the third consecutive year in which Federer and Nadal had met in the championship match of Wimbledon. Federer had won not only both previous meetings, but had been the reigning Wimbledon champion since 2003. Federer’s five consecutive titles (2003-2007) were a record shared with Björn Borg. Federer was also looking to equal Borg's record of 41 consecutive match wins at Wimbledon, a record dating back to 1981. Federer had an overall active streak of 65 consecutive match wins on grass, dating back to June 2003, which still remains the longest tour-level grass-court winning streak for a male player in the Open Era. At Wimbledon 2008, Federer was attempting to surpass Borg's record by becoming the first male player in the Open Era to win six consecutive Wimbledon titles, and the first since William Renshaw in 1886. Federer was also looking to equal Martina Navratilova's Open Era record of six consecutive titles in the women's game. \nNadal had recently won the French Open, for the fourth year in succession, defeating Federer in their third consecutive final of that tournament. The Spaniard was attempting to complete the French Open-Wimbledon double (\"Channel Slam\"); this feat was known to be extremely difficult because it required the player to make the switch from a slower clay surface to a faster grass surface within a fortnight. In the Open Era, only two men had previously achieved this feat: Rod Laver (1969) and Björn Borg (1978, 1979 &amp; 1980).\nFederer had contracted mononucleosis in December 2007, and received medical clearance to train normally and compete on 20 February 2008, five days before the 2008 Dubai Tennis Championships started. Some analysts wondered whether his physical recovery was complete by the time of Wimbledon. Others disagreed, opining that the vestiges of Federer's fatigue were no longer visible during the 2008 clay court season. On the other hand, in an interview for Movistar, Nadal stated that his foot was severely injured, requiring anesthesia before the match, and \"had to play with my foot asleep\".\nMatch details.\nAlthough the players were due on court at 14:00 BST on 6 July 2008, rain delayed the start of the match by about 35 minutes. The umpire was .\nNadal won the first two sets 6–4, 6–4 (he won the second set by winning 5 consecutive games after trailing 1–4), and had triple break point at 3–3, 0–40 on Federer's serve in the third set. Federer won five consecutive points and held serve. A few minutes later rain stopped play once again, with Federer leading in the third set 5–4. After an 80-minute break for the weather, Federer battled back to win the next two sets, 7–6, 7–6, saving two championship points in the fourth set tiebreak. That fourth set tiebreak is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever played. With the score at 5–2, Nadal had the opportunity to win the title on his next two serves. However, he double faulted, then netted a backhand, bringing the tiebreak back on serve. Nadal saved a set point and had his first championship point, but failed to return Federer's serve. At 7–7, Nadal hit a seemingly impossible forehand down the line past Federer, setting up another championship point, this time on his serve, but Federer responded with an equally remarkable backhand down the line to extend the match. BBC commentator Andrew Castle said, \"The two best passing shots of the tournament, without doubt, have just taken place on the last two points.\" A second rain delay at 19:53 BST kept the players in the locker room for another 30 minutes. When they returned onto the court, darkness had already started setting in, threatening to delay the match until the next day. During the deciding set, Federer was two points away from claiming his sixth consecutive Wimbledon crown, but Nadal ultimately held serve and eventually broke Federer's serve in the 15th game of the set. Nadal then served out the match in the following game and won the final set 9–7, claiming his first Wimbledon and fifth Grand Slam tournament singles title. The match ended in near darkness at 21:15 BST.\nDuring the match, Federer only converted one of thirteen break points on Nadal's serve.\nIt was the last Wimbledon final to be significantly affected by rain, as a retractable roof was being installed at Centre Court and was in place by the 2009 Wimbledon Championships.\nSignificance.\nAt 4 hours and 48 minutes, the match at the time was the longest singles final at Wimbledon in terms of time played. It was overtaken by the 2019 men's singles final, another match involving Federer, in which he lost to Novak Djokovic.\nNadal defeated Federer at his most successful major and ended his 40-match winning streak at Wimbledon: his last defeat was to Mario Ancic at the 2002 tournament. By winning the match, Nadal achieved the rare French Open–Wimbledon double (\"Channel Slam\"), joining Rod Laver and Björn Borg as the only men to do so in the Open Era. Federer completed the \"Channel Slam\" in 2009; Nadal (for a second time) in 2010; and Novak Djokovic achieved the feat in 2021.\nTwo months later, in August, after a record 160 consecutive weeks spent as world no. 2, Nadal finally overtook Federer in the ATP rankings, ending Federer's record 237 consecutive weeks as world no. 1. Some tennis analysts questioned whether 2008 was the beginning of Federer's decline in favour of the younger Nadal. Federer, however, regained the top ranking on three occasions, after winning Wimbledon in 2009 and 2012 and the Rotterdam Open in 2018. Federer also made the finals of the next six consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, winning 4/6 of these finals: 2008 US Open (won), 2009 Australian Open (finalist), 2009 French Open (won), 2009 Wimbledon (won), 2009 US Open (finalist), and 2010 Australian Open (won). In contrast, Nadal only made one Grand Slam final during this time, defeating Federer in the 2009 Australian Open final. Federer won a further four majors later in his career, between 2012-18, before retiring in 2022. He ended his career with a total of 20 Grand Slams. Nadal went onto to win a total of 22 Grand Slams, and regained the number 1 ranking on several occasions, most recently holding the position in February 2020. As of March 2024, Nadal and Federer have a combined Grand Slam total of 52, with 25 coming after the 2008 final (17:8 in favour of Nadal). \nIn the 2010s, the Federer-Nadal rivalry was superseded by the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry, with some pundits and commentators considering their 2012 Australian Open final to be the greatest match of all time."

They play their home games at various grounds across the county, including Beaconsfield Road, Widnes. They are coached by Chris Chambers and captained by Eleanor Threlkeld. They won both the County Championship and the Twenty20 Cup in 2017. Lancashire have links with Cumbria, with some players playing for both sides, as well as some of their players making up a North Representative XI in 2021 and 2022. They are partnered with the regional side North West Thunder.\nHistory.\n1930–1997: Early History.\nLancashire Women played their first game in 1930, against the Women's Cricket Association, which they won by 111 runs. Over the following years, Lancashire played various one-off games, often against nearby counties such as Yorkshire and Cheshire. They also competed in the Women's Area Championship, and the inaugural Women's County Championship, as a combined team with Cheshire, Lancashire and Cheshire Women.\n1998– : Women's County Championship.\n1998 was the first season in which Lancashire competed in the County Championship on their own, and they finished 3rd in Division 3, before being promoted the following season. Over the following seasons, Lancashire bounced between the divisions, having a four-year stint in Division One, from 2004 to 2007, but also reaching as low as Division Three in 2010 and 2011. They topped Division Two in 2013 and 2014: in 2013 they lost the Division Final to Somerset, but managed to gain promotion in 2014. They were relegated in 2015, but bounced straight back up to Division One in 2016.\nLancashire then went on to have an exceptional 2017 season, in which they won both the County Championship and the Women's Twenty20 Cup. In the Championship, they topped Division One with 5 wins from 7 games. Lancashire bowler Sophie Ecclestone was the leading wicket-taker in the Division, while Amy Satterthwaite and Evelyn Jones were the 3rd and 4th leading run-scorers, respectively. Meanwhile in the T20 Cup, Lancashire won 7 from 8 games to claim the title, with batter Emma Lamb ending the tournament as the leading run-scorer for the division. In the following years, Lancashire retained their place in Division One of the Championship without seriously challenging for the title, whilst managing a second-place finish in the 2019 Women's Twenty20 Cup, one point behind Champions Warwickshire. In 2021, they competed in the North Group of the Twenty20 Cup, and won their region, with 4 wins and 4 matches abandoned due to rain.

Warwickshire went on to play various one-off matches, including regular matches against Surrey. Meanwhile, West Midlands Women, which included players from Warwickshire, joined the Women's Area Championship in 1980, and played in the competition until it ended in 1996, upon which they joined the Women's County Championship.\n2001– : Women's County Championship.\nWarwickshire Women replaced West Midlands Women in the County Championship in 2001, and finished 4th in Division 3 in their first season. Warwickshire played in the lower tiers of the Championship in the early years of the competition, before making their way up the divisions, beginning with their promotion from the County Challenge Cup in 2006, followed by promotions from Division Three in 2007 and Division Two in 2012.

        "title": "Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships",
        "text": "The Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships is the longest tennis match in history. It was a first-round Men's singles match, in which the American 23rd seed John Isner played against French qualifier Nicolas Mahut. The match began at 6:13 pm (British Summer Time, or 17:13 UTC) on Tuesday, 2010, on Court 18 at Wimbledon. At , due to the fading daylight, play was suspended before the start of the fifth set. After resuming on Wednesday, 23 June, at , the record for longest match was broken at . Play continued until the final set was tied at 59 games all, at which point the daylight faded again, and so play was suspended once more at . Play resumed again at on Thursday, 24 June, and eventually Isner won the match at , the final set having lasted for 8 hours, 11 minutes.\nIn total, the match took 11 hours, 5 minutes of play over three days, with a final score of 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7–9), 7–6(7–3), 70–68 for a total of 183 games. It remains, by far, the longest match in tennis history in terms of both duration and number of games. The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.\nBoth players broke numerous Wimbledon and tennis records, including each serving over 100 aces, with the match being referred to as \"the endless match.\"\nA rule change was instituted for the 2019 Championships, introducing a tie break when the score in the fifth set (third set for women's matches) reaches 12–12. A further rule change during 2022 trialed a 10-point tie break at 6-6 in the final set of all Grand Slam matches, meaning that under current rules, the Isner–Mahut match will likely remain the longest match in tennis history.\nBackground.\nThe match took place during the 2010 edition of the 13-day Wimbledon Championships, held every June and July. Mahut, who was not ranked high enough to qualify for the tournament automatically, earned his place by winning in the qualifying pre-tournament, where he was seeded 27th. He played three qualification rounds, beating Frank Dancevic 6–3, 6–0, in the first round, then Alex Bogdanovic 3–6, 6–3, 24–22, and finally Stefan Koubek in five sets, 6–7(8), 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, 6–4.\nHaving played through the qualifying stage, Mahut was drawn against Isner in the first round of the Men's Singles. Their match was scheduled for Court 18, one of the larger outer courts at Wimbledon.\nMatch.\nDetails.\nThe match started on the tournament's second day. As in all men's Grand Slam matches, the match was played as best of five sets. In the first four sets of a match, a tiebreaker is used to decide a tied set; however, as of 2010, this did not apply in the fifth set except at the US Open. Thus, in the event of a tie in the fifth set, the players would continue to play the set until one of them led by two games.\nThe first four sets passed without significant incident. Isner won the first set 6–4, breaking Mahut's serve in the ninth game of the set after Mahut had twice double faulted. Mahut took the second set 6–3, having broken Isner's serve to love in the second game of the set. The third and fourth sets had no breaks of serve and were both decided by tiebreaks, with Mahut winning the third set tiebreak 9–7, and Isner winning the fourth set tiebreak 7–3, leaving the score at two sets each. At the end of the fourth set, the match was halted due to darkness.\nResuming on , it soon became the longest match ever. Isner failed to convert four match points on this day, the first when Mahut was serving at 9–10, the second and third when Mahut was serving at 32–33, and the fourth in the dramatic last game that they played at 58–59 on , with Mahut initially serving up 40–15 for the hold. Mahut also failed to convert two break points on Isner's serve, at 50–50. The match was suspended for a second time because of darkness on the evening of at 59–59 in the fifth set despite chants of \"We want more, we want more\" from the spectators.\nIsner drank a \"recovery shake\" and took an ice bath. Fellow American Andy Roddick brought take-out food for him and his coach, including \"three boxes of pizza, all sorts of chicken and mashed potatoes\"; Isner said later that he was so hungry he \"could have eaten 12 Big Macs\", but reported that drinking coconut water helped him rehydrate and avoid the cramping that he had experienced in the past. He slept for less than four hours before rising. Mahut also slept for only a few hours, and had a cold bath and a massage. The next morning, the BBC reported that Mahut had been practising and Andy Murray informed them that Isner had been running on a treadmill before play resumed.\nThe match was resumed on , and both players continued to dominate their service games. With Isner serving at 68–68, Mahut went up 0–30, but Isner won 4 points in a row to hold serve. At 68–69, with Mahut serving at 15–15, Mahut netted a drop shot that would likely have won the point. Isner, far back in the court at the time, later said that he would not have had the energy to chase after that shot. At 30–30, Isner passed Mahut at the net with a difficult inside-out forehand from the middle of the court that landed just inside the line. This brought up Isner's fifth match point (his first on 24 June) and his 14th break point of the match, which Isner converted with a down-the-line backhand passing shot. Thus, after 67 minutes of play on the third day of the match, Isner won the deciding final set, 70–68. The entire match over the 3 days lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes. This new world record for the longest match ever was 4 hours and 32 minutes longer than the previous record, the first-round match between Fabrice Santoro and Arnaud Clément at the 2004 French Open, which had lasted 6 hours, 33 minutes.\nOfficials.\nThe chair umpire throughout the match was the Swedish official Mohamed Lahyani. Lahyani said afterwards that he was so \"gripped by the amazing match\" that his concentration stayed solid and he did not think about eating or going to the toilet. On the second day of the match, two groups of 14 linespeople and four groups of 28 ballboys and ballgirls were used in a rotation. At the end of the match, Lahyani announced the score incorrectly, accidentally switching the scores of the two tie-break sets.\nFailing scoreboard.\nOn the second day of play, the courtside scoreboard stood still at 47–47 and later went dark. IBM programmers said it was only programmed to go to 47–47 but would be fixed by the next day. The online scoreboard at the official website lasted slightly longer; it was reset at 50–50. Users were asked to \"please add 50 to the Isner/Mahut game score\". An IBM programmer worked on a hotfix for the scoring system until to accommodate the match's scores for the next day, although it would have again malfunctioned had the match gone beyond 25 more games.\nAftermath.\nSpecial recognition.\nImmediately after the match, both players and the umpire were presented with a crystal bowl and champagne flutes by Tim Henman and Ann Haydon-Jones on behalf of the All England Club, as special recognition of the match. The players were then interviewed on court by John Inverdale, before a photocall for the press alongside one of the two Court 18 scoreboards showing the score. Mahut subsequently donated memorabilia from the match for display at the International Tennis Hall of Fame's Museum in Newport, Rhode Island.\nOn 14 July, Isner and Mahut were jointly awarded the 2010 ESPY Award for \"Best Record-Breaking Performance\", beating fellow nominees Roger Federer and Usain Bolt. Isner accepted the award in Los Angeles on behalf of both men.\nIn addition, the AELTC placed a plaque commemorating the match at Court 18. \"Time\" named this match one of the Top 10 Sports Moments of 2010.\nPlayers' subsequent schedules.\nAs the winner, Isner advanced to the second round where, on the day following the conclusion of his match with Mahut, he played Thiemo de Bakker on 25 June at on Court 5. The match was originally scheduled for 24 June but was postponed due to the continuance of Isner's first-round match against Mahut. De Bakker also had a lengthy first-round match against Santiago Giraldo, winning by a score of 16–14 in the fifth set, but unlike Isner, he had a day off before his second-round match. Isner lost to De Bakker 0–6, 3–6, 2–6 in just 74 minutes. It was the shortest men's Wimbledon match at that point in 2010, and Isner failed to serve a single ace. Isner was visibly exhausted and required medical treatment for neck and shoulder problems throughout the match.\nIsner was also due to play a doubles match with his partner Sam Querrey on 24 June (against Michał Przysiężny and Dudi Sela), but it was postponed to 25 June. Isner's doubles match was tentatively scheduled as the second match of that day on Court 19 following another men's doubles match; however, they withdrew from the doubles because Isner had a blister on his toe. After being eliminated from the tournament, Isner said, \"I'll watch sports, I'll take in the World Cup, I'll go fishing, I'll do whatever. Just anything away from the tennis court.\"\nAs for Mahut, his doubles match with partner Arnaud Clément against Colin Fleming and Ken Skupski started late in the evening on 24 June (also on Court 18); the match was suspended after Mahut and Clément had lost the first set. On 25 June, Mahut/Clément – Fleming/Skupski was scheduled as the fourth match on Court 18 because Clément had a third-round singles match on Centre Court against Roger Federer. Because the match between Daniel Brands and Victor Hănescu lasted almost 3 hours, 30 minutes and ended around 8:45 pm local time, the doubles match was postponed again; it was rescheduled as the first match on Court 14 on 26 June. On resumption, Fleming/Skupski defeated Mahut/Clément, 7–6, 6–4, 3–6, 7–6.\nThe two next met at the 2011 Hopman Cup exhibition in Perth. Isner broke in the opening game to record a win in straight sets. They met again at the 2011 Wimbledon Championships, again in the first round. The odds of the unseeded players meeting in another first round match was 1 in 142. Isner won \"Isner–Mahut II\" in straight sets (7–6, 6–2, 7–6), in 2 hours and 3 minutes.\nReaction.\nFormer players and commentators have called the match historic and unlikely to happen again; many also praised both participants. John McEnroe said, \"This is the greatest advertisement for our sport. It makes me proud to be a part of it. We often don't get the respect we deserve in tennis for the athletic demands it places on players, but this should push that respect way up\".\nOther players, former players, officials, media commentators and fans also praised the behaviour of both players. Roger Federer said of the match, \"It's so impressive to see. I mean, I was watching this. I don't know if I was crying or laughing. It was too much\". Federer also added, \"This is absolutely amazing. [...] This is beyond anything\". Novak Djokovic extolled both players, saying, \"You have to give them credit, both of them. Whoever wins today, I think both of them are winners\".\n\"Sports Illustrated\"'s Jon Wertheim said that the victory might give Isner a self-esteem boost. McEnroe speculated, however, that the match might have shortened Isner and Mahut's careers by six months. A sports surgeon said the players had risked dehydration, hyperthermia, and kidney damage during the long match, and that one or both might suffer \"some sort of injury or persistent problem over the next six months [...] shoulder problems, tendonitis, and recurrent knee problems\", as well as the inability to \"get into a groove\" mentally for up to a year. Mahut revealed that following the match, he spent three months suffering from depression and a back injury.\nMahut shared his experiences on the match in the book \"Le match de ma vie\" (\"The Match of My Life\"), which he co-wrote with Philippe Bouin. The book was published in 2011.\nRule change.\nIn October 2018, three months after another marathon match featuring Isner – this time against Kevin Anderson in the semifinals of 2018 Wimbledon, which Anderson won 7–6(8–6), 6–7(5–7), 6–7(9–11), 6–4, 26–24 after 6 hours and 36 minutes, the All England Club announced that Wimbledon would be introducing a rule change to prevent such long matches occurring in the future. From 2019 to 2021, tie breaks were to be played at Wimbledon if the final set score reached 12–all. This point was determined following a review of matches in the previous 20 tournaments and a consultation with players and officials. The rule was first used in the singles in the 2019 Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, after their fifth set ended that way. In 2022, it was announced that all Grand Slam tournaments (and even the Olympics) would collectively trial a new 10-point tie-break where scores reach 6–6 in the final set; prior to this, the French Open had been the last tournament to exclude tie-breaks from the final set.\nFurther recognition.\nWimbledon had planned to recognize the players on the 10th anniversary of the match, but was unable to do so owing to their decision to cancel the 2020 Wimbledon Championships in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Wimbledon posted video coverage of the match in its entirety on its YouTube channel. In lieu of an in-person reunion, John Isner and Nicolas Mahut celebrated their anniversary via social networks. Isner joked about Mahut's hairstyle: \"Nicolas Mahut, I can't believe it's been 10 years. Your hair hasn't moved an inch yet!\" For his part, Mahut replied: \"Happy birthday friend John Isner. We should take some time together to remember that amazing story.\"\nIn popular culture.\nThe chorus of Dan Bern's song about the match concludes with the scores of the five sets: \"six–four, three–six, six–seven, seven–six, seventy–sixty-eight\". An a cappella performance of \"Isner &amp; Mahut\" recorded in 2010 appears on Bern's album \"Live in New York\".\nHBO released a mockumentary in 2015 titled \"7 Days in Hell\", starring Andy Samberg and Kit Harington as two professional tennis players who face off in what becomes the longest match in history. The match takes place at Wimbledon in 2001. The film was inspired by the Isner–Mahut match and included former and current professional tennis players in cameo roles playing themselves, including John McEnroe, Chris Evert and Serena Williams.\nThis match also has a mention in Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer's 2016 song \"Open String\" from the album \"There's a Rumpus Going On\".\nThe 2018 novel \"Chance to Break\" by Owen Prell builds its narrative climax around the Isner–Mahut match.\nAn episode of SB Nation's \"Rewinder\" on July 9, 2022, focuses on the match and the background and context as to how it happened.\nRecords.\nThe match set at least eleven tennis records:\nThe previous record for games played in a match was the 122-game 1973 Davis Cup match in which the United States team of Stan Smith and Erik van Dillen defeated the Chile team of Patricio Cornejo and Jaime Fillol 7–9, 37–39, 8–6, 6–1, 6–3. The previous record for most games in a singles match was the 112-game 1969 match in which Pancho Gonzales defeated Charlie Pasarell 22–24, 1–6, 16–14, 6–3, 11–9, also in the first round at Wimbledon. The singles record since the introduction of the tie-break was the 2003 Australian Open quarter-final match, in which Andy Roddick and Younes El Aynaoui played 83 games; Roddick won 4–6, 7–6(5), 4–6, 6–4, 21–19.\nThe previous official record for duration was set at the 2004 French Open when Fabrice Santoro defeated Arnaud Clément 6–4, 6–3, 6–7(5), 3–6, 16–14, in 6 hours, 33 minutes. The unofficial record of 6 hours, 40 minutes, was set on 2009, when Chris Eaton defeated James Ward 6–3, 6–2, 6–7(3), 2–6, 21–19 in a playoff match to represent the Great Britain Davis Cup team in a 2009 Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I second round tie versus Ukraine. Isner–Mahut's fifth set alone lasted some 90 minutes longer than the previous longest match. Indeed, even that portion of the fifth set played on the second day was about half an hour longer than the previous longest match, so it also broke the record for the longest play in a single day.\nJohn Isner served his 79th ace to take the final set to 39–38 with serve. This surpassed Ivo Karlović's 78 aces that he served on 2009 in a Davis Cup match against Radek Štěpánek. In all, Isner served 113 aces; Mahut also surpassed the previous record with 103 aces. At the 2012 edition of Wimbledon, Serena Williams had a women's record 102 aces for the entire tournament, falling short of both Isner's and Mahut's aces in a single round.\nThe length of the match exceeded the total playing time of Serena Williams in every round combined in winning the previous year's Ladies Wimbledon title. She played for less than ten hours in the entire tournament.\nCoverage.\nIn the United Kingdom, the match was featured live in part on BBC One, BBC Two and BBC HD, which were all the television channels which the BBC used to cover Wimbledon. The match was broadcast live in its entirety on the BBC Red Button.\nCommentating for the BBC during this match were Ronald McIntosh and Mark Cox on the first day, and McIntosh and Greg Rusedski on the second and third days. It was McIntosh's first ever Wimbledon commentary and became the longest continuous commentary for a single match in broadcasting history.\nThe fifth set of the match was covered by Xan Brooks of the Guardian on their Wimbledon Live Blog and continued the following day by Nicky Bandini.\nIn the United States, ESPN and sibling channel ESPN2 telecast the match.\nMatch statistics.\nSession times.\nAll times in British Summer Time (UTC+1)"

        "title": "Ryan Reid (basketball)",
        "text": "Ryan Rupert Reid (born October 30, 1986) is an American-born Jamaican former professional basketball player.\nReid played college basketball with the Florida State Seminoles. After four years in college, he was drafted by the Indiana Pacers with the 57th pick in the 2010 NBA draft. After the draft, his draft rights were immediately traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, the Thunder did not sign him to a contract and Reid went on to play with in the Tulsa 66ers, the NBA Development League (NBA D-League) affiliate of the Thunder. He played for the 66ers for one season before he was signed by the Thunder for the 2011–12 season.\nEarly life.\nRyan Reid was born to Jasmine and Kenneth Mullings. He was born and grew up in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. He attended and played for Boyd Anderson High School in his hometown. During his last three years with Boyd Anderson, he averaged 18 points, 12 rebounds and 3 blocked shots. After graduating in 2005, he attended Florida State University. He reportedly chose Florida State over Florida, Miami, Georgia, Houston and Pittsburgh. He also played basketball in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) with the Tallahassee Wildcats.\nCollege career.\nReid played under coach Leonard Hamilton for the Florida State Seminoles, who played in the Atlantic Coast Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. As a freshman, he played in all 35 games off the bench, averaging 2.9 points on 56.2 percent shooting and 3.2 rebounds in 16.1 minutes per game. In his sophomore season, he started 21 games and played a total of 25 games for the Seminoles. He improved his performance and averaged 5.6 points on 53.1 percent shooting and 5.0 rebounds in 24.1 minutes per game. He helped the Seminoles to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) tournament in both years.\nReid played 35 games in his junior year, averaging 4.9 points on 44.0 percent shooting and 3.7 rebounds in 19.1 minutes per game. In his final year at college, Reid was named as the team captain. He played in 31 games and averaged 6.8 points on 49.1 percent shooting and 4.0 rebounds in 22.7 minutes per game. He helped the Seminoles to the NCAA Championship in his junior and senior season. Despite his low scoring and rebounding numbers, his biggest contribution for the Seminoles came at the defensive end. He became one of the best defenders in the college and successfully defended top opposing players. He became one of only three players in the Seminoles history to reach the postseason in all four years. Reid, who helped the Seminoles to 88 wins, also had more wins than any other player in school history. He finished his college career with 126 games with 5.0 points per game and 3.7 rebounds per game average. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in social science on May 1, 2010 and became the first person in his family to earn a college degree.\nProfessional career.\nReid was automatically eligible for the 2010 NBA draft after finishing his four-year college eligibility. The Oklahoma City Thunder were the only NBA team which sought to work out before the draft. He was eventually drafted by the Indiana Pacers with the 57th pick in the draft and his rights were immediately traded to the Thunder in exchange for the rights to Magnum Rolle, the 51st pick. His selection was considered a surprise in the draft because some analysts did not even consider him as a top-100 prospect for the draft. Nevertheless, the Thunder was already impressed with Reid's defensive abilities and work ethic and decided to take a chance on him.\nHe played for the Thunder in the 2010 Orlando Summer League. He played in four games, averaging 8.3 points and 3.8 rebounds in 16.0 minutes per game. However, he didn't receive a contract offer or an invitation to the Thunder's training camp for the 2010–11 season. On November 26, 2010, he was acquired by the Tulsa 66ers, the D-League affiliate of the Thunder. His rights in the NBA are still held by the Thunder. Hence, the Thunder is the only team that is allowed to call up Reid to the NBA during the 2010–11 season. He averaged 8.5 points on 50.3 percent shooting and 5.8 rebounds per game in 48 games with the 66ers.\nHe returned to the 66ers for the 2011–12 season. After playing 8 games and averaging 11.8 points and 8.9 rebounds per game, he was called up to the Thunder training camp roster on December 13, 2011. On January 16, 2012, Reid returned to the 66ers on assignment from the Thunder. He was recalled on February 6, 2012.\nOn March 16, 2012, Reid was reassigned to the 66ers. He was recalled and then waived on March 21, 2012. He then returned to the 66ers on March 23, 2012.\nOn November 17, 2014 he signed with SLUC Nancy of the LNB Pro A.\nOn February 14, 2018 he signed with the St. John's Edge of NBL Canada."

        "text": "Stanley Earl Robinson (July 14, 1988July 21, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. He primarily played the small forward position, but occasionally assumed the role of a power forward as well. Robinson played college basketball for the UConn Huskies. He went on to play most of his professional career in South America.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 14, 1988. He studied at the University of Connecticut, and played college basketball with the UConn Huskies. In the run-up to the NBA draft in June 2010, he was described as a \"strong offensive rebounder\" and an \"explosive finisher\". However, his quickness was somewhat cancelled out by mediocre ball-handling, and it was predicted that the absence of major development in his four years of college basketball would lead him to be selected in round two.\nProfessional career.\nRobinson was selected in the second round of the 2010 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic with the 59th overall pick. He signed a non-guaranteed, one-year contract with the Magic. However, Robinson was waived following the conclusion of training camp in October 2010.\nFor the 2011–2012 season, Robinson played with the Iowa Energy of the NBA Development League.\nOn October 17, 2013, Robinson signed with the Moncton Miracles of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL). However, on February 5, 2014, he was released due to an injury. Robinson resigned with the Miracles on September 25 of that year.\nOn September 7, 2015, Robinson signed with Leones de Quilpué, a Chilean club that plays in the Liga Nacional de Básquetbol de Chile (LNB). The following July he moved to the Dominican Republic to play for Reales de La Vega, and in September 2016 he came back to Chile with Deportivo Valdivia, then in November he joined Defensor Sporting in Uruguay.\nIn November 2017, Robinson signed with Keflavík of the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild karla. Disappointed by his physical shape, Keflavík announced on January 2, 2018, they had released him and signed Dominique Elliott in his place. In five games in the Úrvalsdeild, Robinson averaged 15.6 points and 10.4 rebounds.\nIn January 2018, Robinson signed with Club Escuela de Básquetbol Puerto Montt. That September, he moved to Español de Talca also in Chile.\nPersonal life.\nRobinson was father to three daughters, and had moved back to his hometown of Birmingham.\nDeath.\nRobinson was found unresponsive in his Birmingham, Alabama home on July 21, 2020, a week after his 32nd birthday. He died from an accidental opioid overdose, the Jefferson County Coroner reported. The cause of death is officially listed as “fentanyl toxicity\". "

Although other sports (such as tennis and field hockey) are practised in the institution, Tucumán is mostly known for its rugby union team.\nTucumán rugby team is a member of the Unión de Rugby de Tucumán and one of the most successful teams in the province, having won the provincial title 20 times and reaching the final of the Nacional de Clubes on two occasions.\nHistory.\nTucumán Rugby Club was founded on September 5, 1942, by students and employees of the Bank of London branch in San Miguel de Tucumán. At first, most members were English expatriates and the club became known as \"El Club de los Ingleses\" (The Club of the English).\nFor the first few years the club didn't own a ground and had to play rugby in public parks. By the end of the 1950s the club purchased a 3 hectares plot of land in Salas y Valdez and started building its own installations.\nTucumán won the first ever Torneo del Noroeste title in 1944, the first of Tucumán Rugby Club's 20 provincial titles. At the national level the club reached the final of the Nacional de Clubes twice.\nMany Tucumán players went on to represent Argentina at international level, the first of which was Julio Bach in 1966. Tucumán's main rival is Universitario de Tucumán."

        "text": "Roger Walker (18 September 1846 – 11 November 1919) was a rugby union forward who played club rugby for Manchester Rugby Club and international rugby for England. Walker later became the President of the Rugby Football Union, and in that role accompanied the British Isles team on their 1896 tour of South Africa.\nWalker was also a notable cricketer, playing in two first-class matches for Lancashire.\nRugby career.\nWalker came to note as a rugby player during the early history of the sport, playing club rugby for Manchester. In 1874, Walker was selected to play for the England national team, in a game against Scotland, only the fourth international rugby game to be played. In the days before forward positional play, Walker was classed simply as a forward, as part of the twenty man team. England won 1-0, thanks to a dropped goal from Freeman. The next year, Walker was back in the England team, this time in the very first international match for Ireland. Played at the Kensington Oval in London, England won two - nil. Walker played in three more international, all against Scotland, in 1876, 1879 and 1880. England won the 1876 encounter, drew the 1879 game, which was the first contest for the Calcutta Cup; and won the 1880 match. Walker finished his international career with four wins, a draw and no losses.\nWith his international career behind him, Walker continued his association with the sport of rugby by becoming the President of the Rugby Football Union, the national union of rugby in England. In 1896 he travelled with the British Isles, in the role as team manager. The tour, the second undertaken in South Africa, was a success for the tourists, winning three of the four Test matches against the South African national team. In 1898, Walker was central in creating Reading R.F.C., along with G Rowland-Hill and G.R. Joyce.\nCricket career.\nWalker played club cricket for several cricket teams between 1864 and 1901, including Gentlemen of Lancashire, Manchester Cricket Club, Bury Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club. He played in two first-class cricket matches, both for Lancashire, against Darbyshire in 1874 and Marylebone in 1875. A right-handed batsman, Walker ended his first-class career with 27 runs from four innings, and as a wicket-keeper in the field he did not record any bowling figures.\n\"The Rugby Match\".\nIn William Barnes Wollen's painting \"The Rugby Match\", featuring Yorkshire's 11-3 victory over Lancashire during the 1893/94 season, a painting that is now held at the Rugby Football Union headquarters in the Twickenham Stadium, Alf Barraclough can be seen being tackled, and passing the ball to Jack Toothill, with Tommy Dobson on the outside, Roger Walker can be seen in the crowd, he is the seventh person to the right of Tommy Dobson's head."

In addition, he has seen 23 of his former UCLA players advance to Major League Baseball (since 2005). \nSavage has become one of six college baseball head coaches to have won the College World Series (2013), produced the No. 1 overall selection in the MLB Draft (Gerrit Cole in 2011) and coached the winner of the annual Golden Spikes Award (Trevor Bauer in 2011).\nThe Bruins' 2019 squad had 13 MLB Draft selections, the largest single-year total of any baseball team in program history.\nSavage helped take UCLA to the postseason in 2006, his second year with the program. After the Bruins went 15-41 in 2005, they posted a 33-25 overall record in 2006, advancing to the NCAA Malibu Regional, where they went 1-2 with an opening game victory over UC Irvine. In 2007, his third year at UCLA, Savage steered the Bruins to their first NCAA Super Regional appearance since 2000.

The Bruins compiled a 35-24 overall record and won the Pac-10 Conference with an 18-9 mark in league play.\nIn 2012, he led UCLA to the College World Series by defeating TCU in the Los Angeles Super Regional. The Bruins went 1-2 in their trip to the College World Series, defeating Stony Brook before dropping consecutive games to Arizona and Florida State in the second round.\nIn 2013, he guided UCLA to the College World Series by defeating Cal State Fullerton in the Super Regional.

UCLA went 52-11 (setting a school record for wins), claimed the Pac-12 title, spent a program-record 12 consecutive weeks atop the national rankings, and earned the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament for the second time ever. UCLA won all 14 of its regular-season series, a first in program history.\nSavage picked up a pair of milestone wins during the 2019 season, earning his 500th career victory at UCLA after a Friday night win against Oregon State (March 15).

The top 25 highest assists totals in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women's basketball history are listed below. The NCAA did not immediately record assists throughout women's college basketball when it began sponsoring women's sports in the 1981–82 school year; it began recording assists in Division I in 1984–85.\nThe all-time leader in career assists is Suzie McConnell of Penn State. She recorded 1,307 assists in 128 games (10.21 per game average) between 1984–85 and 1987–88. Second on the list is Andrea Nagy of FIU, who compiled 1,165 assists. Only four other women have recorded 1,000 career assists at the Division I level: Caitlin Clark of Iowa (1,144), Courtney Vandersloot of Gonzaga (1,118), Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon (1,091), and Tine Freil of Pacific (1,088).\nAll but two of the players listed compiled their totals in the standard four seasons. The exceptions are Neacole Hall of Alabama State, who compiled 869 assists despite playing only three seasons in Division I (1986–87 to 1988–89), and Lauren Park-Lane, who played in five seasons (2019–20 to 2023–24). Park-Lane benefited from a blanket NCAA waiver that did not count the 2020–21 season, heavily disrupted by COVID-19, against the eligibility of any basketball player. Hall is also the all-time Division I leader in assists per game with 10.35, slightly ahead of McConnell's 10.21. In all, 16 of the top 25 players in career assists are also in the top 25 for assists per game. \nTwo schools have two players represented in the top 25 of the all-time career assists leader board — FIU with Nagy and Dalma Iványi, and Iowa with Clark and Samantha Logic. The aforementioned Park-Lane is the only individual in the top 25 to have played at more than one school; she played four years at Seton Hall before transferring to Mississippi State for her final season."

        "title": "Denver Pioneers men's lacrosse",
        "text": "The Denver Pioneers men's lacrosse team represents the University of Denver (DU) in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college lacrosse. The DU men's lacrosse program was first introduced in 1966 as a club sport. The program alternated between varsity and club status until entering Division I in 1999.\nSince the 2014 season, the Pioneers have competed as an associate member of the Big East Conference. DU was initially a Big East member in men's lacrosse only, but added women's lacrosse to its Big East membership in advance of the 2017 season. Before DU's move to the Big East for the 2014 season, it had been a member of the Great Western Lacrosse League from 1998 to 2009 and then the ECAC Lacrosse League from 2010 to 2013.\nThrough 2015, Denver has an all-time varsity record of 272–203–1. In Division I alone, they are 173–95. Denver plays its home games at Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium, which has a capacity of 2,000 people.\nEarly years.\nThe University of Denver first began sponsoring men's lacrosse as a club sport in 1966 under coach Pete Richardson. Over the next 24 years, the team would alternate between varsity and club status in the RMLA, a member of the US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates (USLIA). In 1991, Denver transitioned into NCAA Division II as a member of the RMILL before making the full transition to Division I with the rest of DU sports in 1999. The Pioneers first joined the Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) as a charter member in 1994, although the Pioneers would not compete in the conference as a full Division I member until 1999.\nIn 1999, Denver hired Jamie Munro as head coach for the team's inaugural season in Division I and the GWLL. Under Munro, the Pioneers would win their first conference regular season title after finishing with a 4–1 conference record (tied with Notre Dame and Ohio State). After winning the GWLL outright in 2006 with a 5–0 conference record, Denver earned a bid to their first NCAA Tournament, where they would fall 16–8 to Maryland. Two years later the Pioneers again shared the GWLL regular season title with Notre Dame and Ohio State, but earned an at-large bid to the 2008 NCAA Tournament with a 10–7 overall record. Denver would lose to Maryland once again, this time 10–7.\nAfter finishing 1–4 in the conference and 7–8 overall in 2009, Jamie Munro resigned. Munro finished with a 90–70 record as head coach of the Pioneers, securing four GWLL Championship titles (2003, 2005, 2006, 2008) and two NCAA postseason tournament appearances (2006, 2008). He was also named GWLL Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2006.\nBill Tierney era.\nIn 2009, Hall of Fame coach Bill Tierney was named head coach of the Pioneers. Tierney was previously the coach at Princeton for 22 years, earning 6 NCAA championships in 9 years, appearing in 8 championship games, 9 Final Fours and 11 Ivy League championships.\nIn 2010, the Pioneers tied the program-best record of 12–5 and earned the ECAC regular season title after completing a 7–0 conference record. Denver would earn just their third NCAA Tournament berth, where they would lose to Stony Brook, 9–7, in the first round.\nIn 2011, the Pioneers completed a 15–3 record, again going undefeated in the ECAC at 6–0 to capture the conference regular season and tournament championships. In the 2011 NCAA Tournament the No. 6-seeded Pioneers hosted No. 11 Villanova in front of a standing room-only home crowd of 2,575. In the first NCAA Tournament game to ever be held west of the Mississippi River, Denver earned its first ever tournament win, beating Villanova 13–10 to advance to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinal round Denver defeated Johns Hopkins 14–9 at James M. Shuart Stadium in Hempstead, New York to earn a spot in the NCAA Final Four. At M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore the Pioneers would fall to the eventual champion Virginia by a score of 14–8.\nFollowing the school's first NCAA Final Four, the Pioneers completed a 9–7 record while going 3–3 in the ECAC. Although the 9–7 regular season tally did not compare to previous season records, Denver lost six one–goal games, including four in overtime throughout the season. The Pioneers would still make the 2012 NCAA Tournament thanks to one of the toughest schedules in the country. In the first round the Pioneers defeated North Carolina 16–14 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, but would go on to lose to conference rival and eventual national champion Loyola-Maryland for the third time, by a score of 10–9 in front of 13,390 fans at the Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland.\nIn 2013, Denver would once again capture the ECAC regular season crown after earning a 6–1 conference record and an 11–3 overall record. After the 11th week of the season Denver would earn the No. 1 ranking in both the Nike/Inside Lacrosse Media Poll and the USILA Coaches Poll, the first time in program history that they have been ranked No. 1 in the country. Denver would go on to lose to Ohio State in the ECAC title game, but the Pioneers would earn an at-large bid to the 2013 NCAA Tournament. In the first round Denver would host just the second NCAA Tournament game held west of the Mississippi at a sold out Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium. A record 2,621 fans were on hand to see Denver top Albany 19–14. In the quarterfinals, Denver faced a rematch of a 2011 first round game against North Carolina, this time at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. After falling behind 6–0 early on, the Pioneers were behind 9–4 at the half but would go 8–2 in the second half, including 5–1 in the final quarter to win 12–11. Denver became the first team in Men’s Lacrosse Championship Quarterfinal history to win after trailing by five goals or more. In the Pioneer's second semifinal appearance in three years, Denver would fall to Syracuse 9–8 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Denver would end the season 14–5 and ranked No. 4 in the final polls.\nThe 2015 season was the most successful in DU lacrosse history. The Pioneers won both the Big East regular-season and tournament titles, earning a #4 seed in that year's NCAA tournament. They went on to win the NCAA title, defeating Maryland in the final at Lincoln Financial Field and becoming the first-ever NCAA men's lacrosse champion from outside the Eastern Time Zone.\nOn January 5, 2023, Tierney announced he would retire at the end of the 2023 season. During the 2023 season, Tierney's top assistant Matt Brown, also a former Pioneers player, was announced as Tierney's replacement.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Denver's season results since becoming an NCAA Division II program in 1991 and becoming a full member of Division I in 1999:"

However, the Austrian Football Association chose not to participate.\n1934 World Cup in Italy.\nAfter defeating France and Hungary on their way into the semi-finals, the strong Austrian squad lost 0–1 to hosts and eventual champions Italy.

However, after the Anschluss in March 1938, the Austrian Football Association was incorporated into the German system. Nine Austrian players were called up for the Germany national squad instead. After being fielded in the opening match against Switzerland, Willibald Schmaus and goalkeeper Rudolf Raftl were the first players ever to represent two different nations at the FIFA World Cup.

Austria later won 2–0 over the Algerians that saw them at a comfortable position in the group stage; however, Algeria, having already beaten West Germany in an upset, found themselves victorious against an already-eliminated Chile, and thus were all-but guaranteed to proceed to the next round alongside Germany, potentially leaving Austria out.\nAustria played their decisive final group stage encounter against neighbors West Germany in Gijón, Spain, in one of the most controversial matches in World Cup history. Nicknamed \"the Disgrace of Gijón, the match saw West Germany scoring once against Austria before both teams and players deliberately played underwhelmingly, wasting the clock and mathematically having both European teams of the group qualify at the expense of Africa's Algeria, the latter whom had defeated the Chileans a day prior to conclude their part of the group stage. Outrage from Algerian fans and Spanish spectators ensued, and both the German and Austrian media condemned the underhanded tactics of both teams' method of subversive \"boring\" football, with the German commentary team constantly apologizing to viewers for the sub-par action. Algerian football fans dubbed the match \"the Anschluss\", a reference to Austria being annexed by Germany under the Nazi regime. Austria saw themselves bowing out in a three-team group of the second stage, losing to France and drawing with Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, West Germany reached the final, losing 3–1 to European rivals Italy.\nAwards.\nIndividual awards.\nErnst Happel has won 2nd Place as a coach with the Netherlands in 1978 after losing the final 3-1 a.e.t. to Argentina"

        "text": "The FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup finals are matches which are the last of the competition, and the results determine which country's team is declared world champions. If after 36 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 3-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty mark, commonly called a penalty shootout, under the sudden death rules. The winning penalty shoot-out team are then declared champions. The 2011 final between Brazil and Russia was the highest ever scoring final with 20 goals in all. The lowest scoring final was in 1998, when Brazil beat Uruguay by just 3 goals to nil.\nIn the fifteen world cups, only one has ever gone past normal time being the first FIFA controlled world cup, the 2005 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, when France and Portugal were drawn 3–3 after 36 minutes. The game eventually went to penalties, with Eric Cantona's side winning 1–0.\nIn the fifteen tournaments held, thirty-eight nations have appeared at least once. Of these, ten have made it to the final match, and three have won. With fifteen titles, Brazil are clearly the most successful and powerful nation who compete in the World Cup and also one of two nations to have participated in every World Cup finals tournament. The other champions are Portugal, who won in 2001 and, as previously stated, France, who won in 2005."

        "text": "USA Table Tennis, colloquially known as USATT, is the non-profit governing body for table tennis in the United States and is responsible for cataloging and sanctioning table tennis tournaments within the country. It was founded in 1933 as the United States Table Tennis Association. In addition to processing tournaments, USATT maintains a national rating and ranking system.

The pricing for a year for adults is $75 while for juniors and collegians is $45. There are over 300 table tennis clubs affiliated with USATT, almost 50 of which are in California. There are almost 450 USATT Certified Coaches in the United States.\nMajor sanctioned tournaments.\nU.S. Open.\nStarted in 1931, the annual U.S. Open is the oldest table tennis event in the United States.

Charl Schwartzel birdied the final four holes to win his first major championship, two strokes ahead of runners-up Adam Scott and Jason Day.\nEight players held a share of the lead in the last round including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.

Yang shot 67 to trail by two shots. Defending champion Phil Mickelson shot a 70 and Tiger Woods a 71. Henrik Stenson struggled to an 83, including a quintuple bogey 8 on the par-3 4th hole, the highest score on the hole in the history of the Masters.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 8, 2011\"\nMcIlroy kept his lead with a 69 (−3), while Quirós shot a 73 (+1) to fall back to −6, four shots off the lead. Jason Day, in his first Masters appearance, shot a tournament-low 64 (−8) on Friday to move into second place. Tiger Woods shot a 66 to put himself back in the tournament at −7, three shots off the lead. Woods shot 31 on the back nine to charge up the leaderboard. K. J. Choi shot a 70 to move to −7, into third place along with Woods. Notable players who missed the cut were Graeme McDowell, Martin Kaymer, Pádraig Harrington, and Hunter Mahan.\nAmateurs: \"Matsuyama (+1)\", Chung (+4), Kim (+4), Uihlein (+5), Jeong (+6), Smith (+8).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 9, 2011\"\nRory McIlroy held at least a share of the lead for the third straight day. After playing the first 12 holes in one-over par, he birdied 13, 15 and 17 to gain a four shot lead. 2009 champion Ángel Cabrera stormed into second place with a 67 to play in the final pairing on Sunday for the second time in three years. Jason Day, who held the outright lead after hole 5, shot 72 and was also 4 shots back. Tiger Woods struggled to a 74 after a 66 on Friday. Cabrera, Bubba Watson and Adam Scott all shot 67, the round of the day.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 10, 2011\"\nSummary.\nEight different players had at least a share of the lead at one point during the final round, included five simultaneously on the back nine. Rory McIlroy, the 54-hole leader, shot 37 on the front to hold onto the lead, but made triple bogey on 10 and a four-putt double bogey on 12 to quickly fade with a final round 80. He finished ten strokes back in a tie for 15th place. Tiger Woods, who was seven shots back to start the final round, shot 31 on the front nine, including an eagle at 8, to tie for the lead, but a three-putt bogey on 12 and a missed eagle putt on 15 doomed his chance at a fifth Masters title. Woods had previously never come from behind in the final round to win any of his 14 major championships. Geoff Ogilvy, also seven shots back to start the day, birdied 12 through 16 to share the lead, but came up short of his second major. K. J. Choi tied for the lead with a birdie at the 9th hole, but struggled putting on the back nine and finished in a tie for 8th. 2009 champion Ángel Cabrera also shared the lead but bogeys at 12 and 16 led to a solo 7th-place finish.\nAdam Scott stormed up the leader board and after a birdie at 16 held a two shot lead. Jason Day made a birdie putt on 17 and another birdie on 18 to post −12, a share of the clubhouse lead with Scott. However, the day belonged to Charl Schwartzel, who chipped in for birdie at 1, holed out for eagle on 3, and birdied the final four holes to win by two shots; his 66 was the low round of the day. It was Schwartzel's first major win, and he became the third South African to win the Masters, along with Gary Player and Trevor Immelman. It was also the 50th anniversary of Player's 1961 Masters win, when he became the first international player to win the Masters.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

It was part of the Ironman series until 2001. It has been held independently from WTC since 2002. The number of participants is around 3500 individuals and 650 relay teams.\nCourse.\nThe first part of the race, the 3.86 km swim event, takes place in the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal around 10 km outside Roth.\nThe 178.5 km bike ride uses a two-lap course on the countryside, mostly south of Roth. The southernmost point is Greding. The course is mostly relatively flat with a tougher hill once per lap.\nThe final marathon run goes once around a course with several turning points. Mostly the course goes on the same road after each turning points, so competitors meet each other. A major part of the course is along the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal. The finish is in central Roth.\nCourse Conditions \nIn 2021 there were changes in the course which make comparing the results to other years difficult. Because of road construction, the bike portion of the race was shortened from 180km to roughly 170km."

        "text": "North Perrott Cricket Club Ground is a former List A cricket ground located in North Perrott, Somerset. It hosted a single Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy match in 2001 between Somerset Cricket Board and Wales Minor Counties. The ground has also been used by Somerset County Cricket Club and Board for numerous other matches. It has also hosted the Somerset women's cricket team occasionally since 2005. The ground is home to North Perrott Cricket Club, and has been since its creation in 1946.\nHistory.\nGround development.\nThe ground, located on Willis Lane, was levelled and a wicket laid soon after the end of the Second World War. Courtesy of the Hoskyns family, North Perrott Cricket Club began using the ground in 1946. In 1993, the club purchased the ground from the family, thanks in part to an anonymous sponsor, and a grant from the Sports and Arts Foundation. Becoming owners of the ground, the club sought to build a pavilion, and after fund-raising and obtaining planning permission, the pavilion was officially opened in the 2000 season. A couple of years later, the club built a new score-hut, and in 2004 upgraded to an electronic scoreboard.\nUsage by Somerset County Cricket Club.\nNorth Perrott Cricket Club Ground was first used by Somerset County Cricket Club in 1991, when their second XI played a Second XI Championship match against Glamorgan's seconds. Somerset's seconds continued to use the ground regularly over the following years, playing 17 Second XI Championship matches and seven Second XI Trophy matches at the venue. The Somerset Cricket Board team were also fixtures on the ground for four matches. In addition to the first-round match against Wales Minor Counties in the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy, they were also scheduled to play three Minor Counties Trophy matches – two of these were abandoned. In recent years, the ground has also been used by Somerset women's cricket team. The women's side has no fixed home ground, playing at a variety of venues across the county, and first played at North Perrott in 2005. Since then, visits to the ground have become more regular, with over half of their home fixtures in 2009 and 2010 being played there."

        "text": "The 2009 IIHF World Championship final was an ice hockey match that took place on 10 May 2009 at the PostFinance Arena in Bern, Switzerland, to determine the winner of the 2009 IIHF World Championship. Russia defeated Canada 2–1 to win its 3rd championship and its 2nd consecutive championship.\nBackground.\nThis was the second consecutive year that Russia and Canada had met in the final of a World Championship. It was Russia's fourth finals appearance, and they were defending champions having won in 2008, against Canada in a hard-fought 5-4 overtime win. It was Canada's sixth appearance in the finals in seven years. Leading up to the final, both Canada and Russia had a perfect 3 win group stage, and in the qualifying round they both topped their groups. In the semifinals, Russia narrowly defeated the United States with a goal with only about a minute remaining. Canada defeated Sweden 3-1.\nVenue.\nThe PostFinance Arena in Bern was determined to host the final of the championship. Previously at the tournament, the venue hosted both the semi-finals, and also the Bronze medal match. In the final, the attendance was 11,454.\nThe Match.\nSummary.\nCanada struck first, when at 5:37 into the first period Jason Spezza scored just outside the crease on a pass from Shane Doan, who had only seconds ago come out of the penalty box. For several minutes the Canadians pressured, but Ilya Bryzgalov remained strong. Braydon Coburn took a penalty mid-way through the period, which led to a Russian power play. On the PP, Vitali Atyushov took a shot from the point, which was deflected by Oleg Saprykin through traffic past Dwayne Roloson, to tie up the game for team Russia.\nOn a 2-on-1, after a Canadian error on the blue line, Alexander Radulov carried the puck in and fired a shot on the far side which beat Roloson, at 14:50 in the second. This would end up as the winning goal.\nIn the third period team Canada brought up the offensive, with 16 shots in the third alone, and a total of 38 on the night, compared with only 19 shots total from Russia. However Bryzgalov was solid in net for Russia. With the 2-1 victory, Russia won its first ever consecutive championship final."
