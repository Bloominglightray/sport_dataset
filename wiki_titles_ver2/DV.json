        "text": "The European Zone of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup saw 53 teams competing for 13 places at the finals in Brazil. The draw for the qualification groups was held at the World Cup Preliminary Draw at the Marina da Glória in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 30 July 2011. \nThe qualification format was the same as 2010. The teams were drawn into eight groups of six teams and one group of five, with the nine group winners qualifying directly for the final tournament. The eight best runners-up (determined by records against the first-, third-, fourth- and fifth-placed teams in their groups to ensure equity between different groups) were drawn in two-legged play-offs that determined the remaining four qualifying nations.\nThe qualification process started on 7 September 2012, over two months after the end of UEFA Euro 2012, and ended on 19 November 2013. Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, England, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, and Switzerland qualified in the first round by winning their groups. Croatia, France, Greece, and Portugal qualified via the second round play-offs.\nFormat.\nAll 53 UEFA national teams entered qualification, aiming to secure one of the 13 European Zone slots for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The draw for the qualification groups was held at the World Cup Preliminary Draw at the Marina da Glória in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 30 July 2011. The qualification format was the same as 2010. The teams were drawn into eight groups of six teams and one group of five, with the nine group winners qualifying directly for the final tournament. The eight best runners-up (determined by records against the first-, third-, fourth- and fifth-placed teams in their groups to ensure equity between different groups) were drawn in two-legged play-offs that determined the remaining four qualifying nations.\nSeeding.\nThe July 2011 FIFA World Rankings were used to seed the teams. In consideration of the delicate political situations of the relationships between Armenia and Azerbaijan as well as relations between Russia and Georgia, UEFA requested that FIFA maintain the current UEFA policy not to draw these teams into the same qualification groups – although as Armenia and Azerbaijan were in the same pot they could not be drawn together anyway. The mechanism for keeping Russia and Georgia apart was confirmed by the FIFA Organising Committee on 29 July 2011.\nFirst round.\nThe matches were played between 7 September 2012 and 15 October 2013. An initial schedule that includes matches before this date was not ratified by FIFA. A win was awarded 3 points, a draw was awarded 1 point, and a loss 0. The team with the most points in each group secured direct qualification for the final tournament of the World Cup.\nGroups.\nTie-breaking criteria.\nIf two teams had the same number of points the criteria below were used.\nSecond round.\nGroup runners-up.\nThe eight best group runners-up contested the second round, where they were paired into four two-legged (home-and-away) fixtures. The four winners qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Because one group had one team fewer than the others, matches against the last-placed team in each of the six-team groups were not included in this ranking. Teams were ranked by the following parameters in order:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nThe second round draw took place at the headquarters of FIFA in Zurich on 21 October 2013. The October 2013 FIFA World Rankings were used to decide which of the teams would be seeded (shown below in brackets).\n&lt;section end=Seeding /&gt;\nOne team from pot 1 was paired with one from pot 2 as shown below. The matches were played on 15 and 19 November 2013. Winners: Portugal, France, Greece and Croatia as shown in bold.\nQualified teams.\nThe following 13 teams from UEFA qualified for the final tournament.\nDiscipline.\nIn the qualification tournament, a player would be suspended for the subsequent match in the competition for either getting red card or accumulating two yellow cards in two different matches. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary body has the ability to increase the automatic one match ban for a red card (e.g., for violent conduct). Single yellow card cautions would be erased prior to the play-off portion, and would not carry over. Single yellow cards and suspensions for yellow card accumulations do not carry over to the 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament matches. The following players were suspended during the final tournament – for one or more games – as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulations:\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are full goalscorer lists for all groups and the play-off rounds:"

        "title": "Jack Jenkins (rugby union)",
        "text": "John \"Jack\" Charles Jenkins (19 April 1880 – 24 October 1971) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Newport and London Welsh. He won just a single cap for Wales in 1907 but faced both New Zealand and South Africa at county level with Middlesex and Monmouthshire.\nPersonal history.\nJenkins was born in Newbridge, Caerphilly in 1880. He was educated at Long Ashton School in Bristol before enrolling at Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the South Wales Borderers at the age of 18, but in 1903 he resigned from the British Army and undertook an accountancy course. In 1908, he joined the newly formed Territorial Force, Monmouthshire Regiment. By 1911 he was promoted to the rank of major, and with the outbreak of the First World War, he was posted to France with the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the 2nd Battalion of the Monmouthshire Regiment.\nJenkins married Helena Leigh (née Roose) (birth registered during July→September 1879 in Wrexham district - death registered during October→December 1967 (aged 88) in Bournemouth district), sister of Wales association football international Leigh Richmond Roose, during July→September 1903 in St George Hanover Square district. Jenkins' son, C.R. Jenkins played club rugby for several teams, most notably captaining North of Ireland FC during the 1933/34 season; and like his father, he faced a touring South Africa team in 1931 whilst representing Ulster.\nRugby career.\nJenkins first played rugby at Long Ashton School, and would later represent local teams Mountain Ash and Newbridge. By 1901 he was playing for first class Welsh team Newport, and turned out for the senior team over six seasons making 61 appearances. During this period Jenkins spent much of his time in England, and became a regular for Welsh exiles team, London Welsh, and also played for Rosslyn Park and Middlesex County rugby team. In 1905, Jenkins faced his first international opposition, when he was part of the Middlesex team to face the Original All Blacks at Stamford Bridge, during the New Zealanders' first overseas tour. Middlesex lost the game heavily, 34–0.\nDuring the 1906/07 season, Jenkins faced the Paul Roos' touring South Africans on three occasions. In the first encounter, Jenkins was playing for Middlesex County, losing 9–0 to the Springboks at Richmond. On 22 November 1906, Jenkins turned out for Monmouthshire to face Glamorgan in a Welsh trial for the upcoming international between Wales and South Africa. Four new caps managed to break into the Welsh team, Jenkins, Dick Thomas of Mountain Ash, John Dyke of Penarth and Cardiff's Johnnie Williams. At the trial, of the new caps, only Williams impressed, none of the other three players showed great ability, but were \"distinctly superior to any of their uncapped rivals\". On 1 December 1906, Jenkins won his one and only cap when he ran out onto St. Helen's in Swansea to face the Sprinkboks. The South Africans won the match comfortably, with much of the blame for the Welsh loss placed on the forward play. Jenkins and Williams were tagged as having \"failed to scrummage\".\nDespite the loss, Jenkins was part of the Monmouthshire County team that faced the same touring South Africans on Boxing Day 1906. Jenkins, along with captain George Travers, was one of only two players with international experience, and the team was further weakened after Newport refused to release their players after an argument over the venue. South Africa out-classed Monmouthshire, winning 17–0, and Jenkins himself gave away the second try after a loose kick.\nIn 1908, Jenkins was invited by fellow London Welsh teammate and friend, Arthur Harding, to join his Anglo-Welsh team on their 1908 tour of New Zealand and Australia. Jenkins was forced to turn down Harding's offer due to personal commitments.\nTowards the end of his rugby career, Jenkins became much more connected to London Welsh, and in the 1910/11 season was given the club's captaincy. He also played a large role in committee matters, and was Honorary Secretary between 1908 and 1911. In 1911 he was one of three members that wrote the club membership rules, but after returning from active duty in France, Jenkins resigned from the club after discovering that the trustees of the club had sold the freehold to Heathfield Ground on Wandsworth Common, London Welsh's home ground. Although Jenkins severed all ties between himself and the club from 1919, his record at London Welsh remained impressive, spanning 12 years and 200 games.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "The 2002 World Fencing Championships were held in Lisbon, Portugal. The event took place from August 18 to August 23, 2002.\nOverview.\nLisbon obtained the right to organize the championships over Bari, Italy. The event was first to take place from August 12 to August 18, but was reported a week later at the request of the main sponsor and of the television stations, which feared poor audience figures.\n84 countries–a record at the time–took part in the championships. The competition saw the clear domination of Russia, who came away with nine medals, including six golds. Stanislav Pozdniakov and Svetlana Boyko obtained a double gold haul respectively in men's sabre and women's foil. Boiko shared the podium with teammate Yekaterina Yusheva, who in quarter-finals had put an end to Valentina Vezzali's streak of gold medals in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Pavel Kolobkov earned a gold medal in men's épée, eight years after his last major title and with a very limited preparation: he was then working as a fencing coach in Boston and rarely took part in Fencing World Cup events. Russia also prevailed in women's team sabre, overcoming Hungary in the final. Ironically, these two countries were the most adamant against the introduction of women's sabre at the Olympics.\nThe Lisbon championships proved however a disappointment for France, whose medals tally dropped from ten at Nîmes 2001 to five. The French preparation for the championships had been affected by a personal conflict between Philippe Omnès, director of fencing of the French federation, and Christian Bauer, national coach for sabre, as well as the positive drugs test of Laura Flessel-Colovic a few days before the competition. France boasted only one gold medal in men's team épée, won against Russia.\nThe remaining medals were relatively spread out between other nations. Romania claimed three bronze medals: one in women's team foil, Laura Badea's first medal after her return from maternity leave, one in men's sabre for Olympic champion Mihai Covaliu and one in women's épée for 17-year-old Ana Maria Brânză. The main surprise however was the growing power of Asian fencing: Korea's Hyun Hee defeated successively favourites Laura Flessel and Imke Duplitzer to earn the gold in women's épée, while China's Tan Xue claimed the title after seeing of previous incumbents Anne-Lise Touya and Elena Jemayeva."

The event took place from September 30 to October 12, 1969, at the Ciudad Deportiva Coliseum.\nOverview.\nThe Havana World championships were the third straight major fencing event held in the Americas after the 1967 edition in Montreal and the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. Cuba gave the competition political overtones, including it in the celebrations for the ten years of the Cuban Revolution. Fencing was also stopped on 8 October for a commemoration of the anniversary of Che Guevara's death. The United States, who do not have formal diplomatic relations with Cuba, sent a restricted delegation of 25 fencers. The competition was also marred by numerous failures of the electrical apparatus to the heat and humidity.\nOn sportive terms, the championships were dominated by countries of the Eastern Bloc, especially the Soviet Union, who claimed all three men's team titles. Romania earned their first women's world title."

They maintained their request the year after, suggesting Cleveland or Indianapolis as hosts. The latter was chosen, but withdrew three months before the event. Denver put itself forward as replacement.\nThe competition was marred by several incidents involving the directoire technique. For instance, Bulgaria's men sabre team unknowingly arrived late at their quarter-final match against West Germany, as the official timetable had been changed along the way; the West Germans protested, and the Bulgarians were disqualified.\nThe USSR and West Germany dominated the championships, especially in foil and sabre. Épée saw several surprises, notably the victory of Spain's Manuel Pereira, who had never placed in the Top 8 of an international tournament before, and who never reached that level again. Women's épée was still a young weapon, allowed by the FIE at the 1988 World Criterium as a demonstration event. It made its first official apparition in Denver. An outsider, Switzerland's Anja Straub, prevailed over Germany's Ute Schäper and Italy's Annalisa Coltorti, while the women's team event saw the beginning of the Hungarian domination."

        "text": "Joseph Carmack Jones Jr. (December 13, 1941 – March 23, 2023) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. He spent all or parts of seven seasons in Major League Baseball as a coach for the Kansas City Royals (1987; 1992; 2005) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1997–2000).\nA second baseman during his active career, Jones stood tall and weighed ; he threw and batted right-handed. A native of Lebanon, Tennessee, he graduated from Southeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan, and played varsity baseball at the University of Michigan, where he earned a degree in education. He was signed by the Chicago White Sox in 1963 and played for seven seasons in the ChiSox' farm system, appearing in 813 minor league games, with 773 hits in 3,027 at bats for a career batting average of .255. He also pitched one inning for the Tidewater Tides in 1965, giving up one run for an earned run average of 9.00, but was credited with the win. Most of Jones' playing career occurred at the Class A level; he appeared in one game in Triple-A, for the 1967 Indianapolis Indians of the Pacific Coast League, batting five times with one hit, a single.\nJones then served as a minor league manager from 1970 through 1983, leaving the White Sox' organization for the Royals' system in 1979. His managerial record was 629 wins and 545 losses, for a .536 winning percentage in 1,178 games. Twelve of those 14 seasons were spent in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. From 1984–86, Jones was the Royals' field coordinator of minor league instruction, leading to the first of his three separate terms as a member of Kansas City's Major League coaching staff.\nIn , Jones served as first-base coach for skippers Billy Gardner and John Wathan, then resumed his former role as field coordinator from 1988 through 1996—a nine-year tenure interrupted by service as interim bench coach in after Glenn Ezell required emergency surgery to repair an aneurysm. From 1997 through early June 2000, Jones was the first-base coach on the Major League staff of Pirates' manager Gene Lamont, a former colleague from the Royals' organization. But Jones was released, along with third-base coach Jack Lind, on June 5, 2000, during a shakeup of Lamont's top aides.\nJones then returned to the Royals in 2001 as coordinator of instruction, serving for four seasons in that role, until one final MLB term in as the Royals' first-base coach. He then worked as a special assistant for player development in the Royals' system in 2006–07.\nJoe Jones died at age 81 on March 23, 2023, survived by his wife of 60 years, two sons, four grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, sister, and nephew.

He played college football for the Fordham Rams and was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the fifth round of the 2010 NFL draft.\nHe was also a member of the Cincinnati Bengals, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Tennessee Titans, and also had a brief stint with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\nEarly years.\nSkelton attended Burges High School in El Paso, where his father served as an assistant coach. He lettered in football, basketball, baseball, and track.

He received Patriot League rookie player of the week honors in that season.\nSkelton had a solid first full year as the starting quarterback in 2007, being named 2007 Second-team All-Patriot League in a season in which he threw for 22 touchdowns (the third best single season total in Fordham history). He threw for over 200 yards in seven games in 2007 and for over 300 yards in two games and ranked second in the Patriot League in passing yards per game and total offense. He led the Fordham Rams to a Patriot League championship, earning them a trip to the NCAA FCS playoffs.

He completed 15 of his 37 passes with 146 passing yards. He was nominated for Rookie of the Week after this game, but Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots wound up winning the award. In Skelton's third NFL start, on Christmas Day, he led the game-winning drive, bringing the Cardinals in field goal range where Jay Feely was able to kick the game winning field goal. The Cardinals won 27–26 against the Dallas Cowboys.\nSkelton would lose the last game of the season against the San Francisco 49ers for the Cardinals throwing both a touchdown pass and an interception.

The competition was won by British athlete Amy Williams, who set new course records for the track on her first and third runs. Williams, who had never before won a World Cup or World Championship event, became the first British athlete to win a solo Winter Olympic gold medal in 30 years. German sliders Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman, who had won the silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Canadian Mellisa Hollingsworth, both of whom had been expected to be in medal contention, were disappointed.\nWilliams' victory was not without controversy, as the United States and Canada filed complaints with the judges related to Williams' helmet. However, judges ruled that ridges in her helmet did not violate International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) rules, and rejected the complaints.\nLogistics.\nTrack.\nThe Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia was the site of women's skeleton at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada.

It was certified for competition in sliding sports by the International Luge Federation (FIL) and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) in March, 2008 in a process called homologation where hundreds of athletes ran the track. This was the first time many competitors at the 2010 Games were able to try the track and begin to develop strategies for it. Canadian athletes hoped that having it open two years before the Games, and having that amount of time to train on it, would give them an advantage in the Games. The Whistler Sliding Centre quickly gained a reputation as one of the fastest tracks in the world.\nRules and description of competition.\nRules for the Olympic skeleton competitions were set by the FIBT and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). They entrusted four to seven officials with making decisions regarding competition rules: one or two technical delegates, a jury president, two jury members, and two optional jury assistants. These decisions were implemented and enforced by a race director, to whom the overall responsibility for running the competition was given. Under the rules, competitors were guaranteed a minimum of six official training runs in the days prior to the competition. The competition itself consisted of four heats, with the starting order of athletes determined by their FIBT rankings prior to the start of the Games. Athletes began their runs on their sleds at a starting block, ran briefly while holding their sleds, and then laid on their stomachs on the sleds through the remainder of the course. Athletes were ranked by the speed of their times between their start and when they crossed the finish line at the bottom of the track.\nPreview.\nMuch of the speculation about potential medal winners before the Games focused on athletes from Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. Athletes from German-speaking countries had traditionally been dominant in the sliding sports, luge and bobsleigh, but following the re-introduction of skeleton, they had not been as strongly competitive in the new sport. Mellisa Hollingsworth of Canada, the defending Olympic bronze medalist, won the 2009–10 Skeleton World Cup, and was considered a strong contender if not the favorite to win. British athlete Shelley Rudman won the only British medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics with her silver in skeleton, and her bronze medal at the European Championships just prior to the Games kept her name in media previews of the Olympic event. Her countrywoman Amy Williams, however, finished outside of the medal places in both the World Cup, in which she placed fifth, and the European Championships, in which she placed sixth. American Noelle Pikus-Pace had not been able to compete in the 2006 Games after a runaway bobsleigh had broken her leg.\nA number of other athletes had the potential to win medals by virtue of previous strong finishes in international competition. Switzerland's Maya Pedersen-Bieri was the defending Olympic champion. The defending world champion was Germany's Marion Trott, who also won the test event held at the venue. The last 2009–10 Skeleton World Cup prior to the 2010 Games took place in Igls, Austria (southeast of Innsbruck) on 22 January 2010 and was won by Germany's Anja Huber.\nStanding records.\nWhile the IOC does not consider skeleton times eligible for Olympic records, the FIBT does maintain records for both the start and a complete run at each track it competes. These records were set during the test event for the 2010 Games on 5 February 2009.\nQualifying athletes.\nOn 20 January 2010, the FIBT announced the teams which had qualified for the 2010 Games, the quotas being subsequently updated on 26 January 2010. The athletes who qualified for the women's event were:\nCompetition.\nThe first run start order was released on the afternoon of 17 February 2010. The first two runs took place on 18 February at 16:00 PST (Pacific Standard Time) and 17:00 PST. On 19 February, the final two runs took take place at 15:45 PST and 16:45 PST. During the first run, Amy Williams broke the previous course record by nearly a full second, finishing first with a time of 53.83 seconds and reaching a top speed of . She led the second run as well. German slider Kerstin Szymkowiak was in second place after two runs, nearly a third of a second behind Williams. Mellisa Hollingsworth, competing on home soil and called the favorite to win in a number of media accounts, was in third place, trailing Szymkowiak after two runs by 0.09 seconds. Shelley Rudman trailed by nearly a full second, surprising many observers who had expected her to be in medal contention. Japanese athlete Nozomi Komuro was disqualified after the first heat because her sled did not have the required FIBT control sticker.\nThe United States, Canada and Germany, together with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful first day of competition. The protest alleged that her helmet was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the helmet, and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in the helmet were not a separate piece affixed to the helmet, expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather an integral part of the helmet, which made the helmet legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.\nThe next day, in her third run, Williams again set a new course record, 53.68 seconds, and won the final run as well to secure the gold medal. Williams became the first British sportsperson to win an individual Winter Olympic gold medal in thirty years. Prior to this win, Williams had never won a World Cup or World Championship event. German athletes, Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber, won the silver and bronze medals, the first Olympic medals for Germany in the sport. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman fought her way into the lead briefly after a fast final run, but was overtaken by a five other athletes and finished sixth. Canada's Hollingsworth dropped from third place after the first two runs to fifth after the final run. American Noelle Pikus-Pace, who was in sixth place after the third run, finished fourth in the overall standings.\nResults.\nTR - Track Record (in \"italics\" for previous marks).

Germany's Felix Loch was the two-time defending world champion and won the gold medal with the fastest time in each of the four runs. The test event that took place at the venue was won by Germany's David Möller, who would win the silver medal in this event. Italy's Armin Zöggeler was the two-time defending Olympic champion and won a bronze medal in this event. The last World Cup event prior to the 2010 games took place in Cesana, Italy on 30 January 2010 and was won by Zöggeler, who also won the overall World Cup title.\nAs a consequence of the training accident that killed Nodar Kumaritashvili on 12 February 2010 officials moved the start of the men's singles competition to the women's/doubles start to reduce the speed of the racers. This change was met with mixed reviews, with some participants saying that the change made them feel safer, while others complained that it gave an advantage to stronger starters.\nLogistics.\nTrack.\nMen's singles luge at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada was held at the Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia. The track was constructed between 2005 and 2008, and became the 15th competition-level track in the world.

They entrust 5 officials with making decisions about whether competition rules have been followed: a technical delegate, three jury members from different countries, and an international judge. These decisions are implemented and enforced by a race director, to whom the overall responsibility for running the competition is given, but who is assisted by a start leader who coordinates the starting area, a finish leader who coordinates the finish area, and a Chief of Track who is in charge of track maintenance. Under the rules, competitors were guaranteed a minimum of five official training runs in the days prior to the competition. The competition itself consists of four runs. Athletes begin their runs on their sleds at a starting block, use their hands to push themselves off in the starting area, and then on their backs on the sleds through the remainder of the course. Athletes are ranked by the speed of their times measured between their start and the finish line at the bottom of the track.\nPreview.\nIn a 2 February 2010 interview with the International Luge Federation, Italy's Zöggeler predicted that Russia's Albert Demtschenko, the defending Olympic silver medalist and the European champion, would win the event, with the other medalists being Germany's Loch and Möller. In the final results, Zöggeler edged out Demtschenko for third place.\nRecords.\nWhile the IOC does not consider luge times eligible for Olympic records, the International Luge Federation (FIL) does maintain records for both the start and a complete run at each track it competes.\nThese records were set during the test event from the men's start house for the 2010 Games on 21 February 2009.\nDeath of Nodar Kumaritashvili.\nDuring training on 12 February 2010, Georgian luger, Nodar Kumaritashvili was going at over when he crashed in the last turn and hit a steel pole. He was administered CPR at the track, then taken away to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Training was immediately stopped. As a result, the start of the men's single competition was moved to the women's/doubles' start to reduce speed and the wall at corner where Kumaritashvili crashed was raised.\nInvestigations conducted the same day concluded that the accident was not caused by deficiencies in the track. As a preventative measure, the walls at the exit of curve 16 were to be raised and a change in the ice profile would be made. A joint statement was issued by the FIL, the International Olympic Committee, and the Vancouver Organizing Committee over Kurmaitasvili's death with training suspended for the rest of that day. According to the Coroners Service of British Columbia and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the cause was to Kumaritashvili coming out of turn 15 late and not compensating for turn 16. Because of this fatality, an extra of wall was added after the end of Turn 16 and the ice profile was changed. It also moved the men's singles luge event from its starthouse to the one for both the women's singles and men's doubles event. Kumaritashvili is the first Olympic athlete to die at the Winter Olympics in training since the death of Nicolas Bochatay during a speed skiing practice at the 1992 Winter Olympics and the first luger to die in a practice event at the Winter Olympics since Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski of Great Britain was killed at the luge track used for the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck. It was also luge's first fatality (on an artificial track) since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger was killed. Kumaritavili's teammate Levan Gureshidze withdrew prior to the first run of the event.\nThe women's singles and men's doubles start was moved to the Junior start house of the track, located after turn 5. Germany's Natalie Geisenberger complained that it was not a women's start but more of a \"kinder\" (\"child\" in German) start. Her teammate Tatjana Hüfner who had the fastest speed on two runs of stated that the new start position \"..does not help good starters like myself\". American Erin Hamlin stated the track was still demanding even after the distance was lessened from and that athletes were still hitting .\nDespite the changes, and celebrations by the victorious athletes, Kumaritashvili's death overshadowed the race. Some athletes who participated in the competition said they were scared during their runs, and welcomed the track changes. Others criticized the changes as having given an advantage to stronger starters like the German participants, as opposed to weaker starters who would have benefited from having a longer course. Argentina's Ruben Gonzalez said, \"God blessed the Germans today.\"\nOn 23 March 2010, FIL President Fendt, VANOC President John Furlong, 2010 men's singles gold medalist Felix Loch of Germany visited Kumaritashvili's grave in his hometown of Bakuriani to pay respects as part of tradition in the Georgian Orthodox Church.\nThe FIL published their reports in regards to Kumaritashvili's death on 12 April 2010 following the FIL Commissions Meeting in St. Leonhard, Austria (near Salzburg) for both sport and technical commissions on 9–11 April 2010.

Austrian brothers Andreas and Wolfgang Linger, the defending Olympic and European champions, won the gold medal. The silver medal was also won by a pair of brothers, Andris and Juris Šics of Latvia. Germans Patric Leitner and Alexander Resch clinched the bronze medal after edging out Italians Christian Oberstolz and Patrick Gruber, who were in third place after the first run.\nChanges had been made to the track after a Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died during a training run before the Games began. The turn where Kumaritashvili died was adjusted and padding was added to metal support pillar nearby. In addition, the start of the doubles race was moved to the junior start, meaning not only that the course was shorter but that the athletes would enter a turn and then a sharp corner almost immediately after the start. This required a change in strategy for many competitors, and a limited number of training runs in which to develop it. However, media reports mentioned the changes positively after a doubles team, Austria's Tobias and Markus Schiegl, crashed in the same turn where Kumaritashvili was killed.\nRules.\nIn accordance with the International Olympic Committee and the International Luge Federation (FIL), 20 doubles teams (40 athletes total) were allowed to take part in the event. Athletes were to be ranked by the number of world cup points they earned in the 2008–09 season and through the first half (before 31 December) of the 2009–10 season. To be eligible, athletes must either have earned world cup points in five World Cups, Nations Cup or Junior World Cup, or have a top-16 (doubles) finish at the world cup during the qualification period. The top-20 doubles sleds were to be qualified for the Olympics, up to two sleds per nation, with unused quotas to be redistributed with priority given to unrepresented nations. The host nation (Canada) was to be guaranteed a sled in every event provided that they reached the minimum requirements.\nInternational Luge Federation rules for doubles events require that teams participate in two competition runs. The times are then added together and the sled with the lowest time is the winner.\nPreview.\nAs defending Olympic and European champions, Andreas and Wolfgang Linger were expected to be competitive in the doubles event. However, there were a number of other teams which were expected to be contenders for the gold medal. Italy's team of Gerhard Plankensteiner and Oswald Haselrieder entered the Vancouver Games as the defending Olympic bronze medalists and the defending world champions. The test event that took place at the venue was won by the German team of André Florschütz and Torsten Wustlich, the defending Olympic silver medalists.

He played fullback for the Alabama Crimson Tide.\nPlaying career.\nLewis scored two touchdowns in the team's 1953 Orange Bowl victory over Syracuse.\nIn the first quarter of the 1954 Cotton Bowl Classic against Rice, he scored his team's only touchdown to give the Crimson Tide a 6–0 lead. Lewis is best remembered for his second quarter off-the-bench tackle of Rice’s halfback Dicky Moegle on a running play that started at the Rice 5-yard line. Moegle took the handoff and raced along the sideline near the Alabama bench. As Moegle passed midfield, Lewis (wearing jersey number 42) sprang from the bench to tackle Moegle. The referee awarded Rice a 95-yard touchdown on the play. Rice won the game, 28–6. Lewis explained his tackle by saying that he \"was just too full of Alabama.\" Lewis and Moegle later appeared together on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\nLewis also played in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Ottawa Rough Riders.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1962, Lewis became the head coach of the Huntsville Rockets, an expansion club in the minor Dixie Professional Football League."

        "text": "Skijoring (also Skijoering) was a demonstration sport at the 1928 Winter Olympics, held in St. Moritz, Switzerland from February 11 through 19, 1928. The sole skijoring event of the Games was held on February 12, the second day of the Games. The sport of skijoring is one in which a person on skis is pulled by dogs, horses, or a form of mechanized transportation such as a snowmobile. In the 1928 Olympics, athletes were towed behind horses.\nSkijoring's roots are in Norway and Sweden, where the sport was considered a military competition, being a method of transportation for military dispatches. It was included on the program of the Nordic Games in 1901, 1905, and 1909. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, and media outlets like \"The Times\" admired the sport after its inclusion in the Nordic Games, and contributed to the brief popularization which led to its inclusion as a demonstration sport in the Games. Coubertin in particular, in his report on the 1901 Nordic Games in the publication \"Revue Olympique\", expressed interest in incorporating such winter sports into the Olympic Games, and mentioned skijoring in particular as being of interest. Thus, it was included in the 1928 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport.\nThe competition in St. Moritz was held on a frozen lake. Unlike modern equestrian skijoring in North America, there were no riders on the horses, there were no jumps on the course, and athletes competed simultaneously. The event was swept by three Swiss athletes. Although the sport was included as a demonstration sport in 1928, the \"Official Report\" of those Olympic Games does not list results of the contest. This would be the last time the sport was included at the Games; it would never again appear as either a demonstration or medal sport."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball single-inning runs batted in leaders",
        "text": "The Major League Baseball (MLB) leaders in runs batted in (RBI) in one inning are topped by record holder Fernando Tatís, then with the St. Louis Cardinals, who set the MLB record with eight RBI in a 1999 game in which he hit two grand slams in the third inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Alex Rodriguez set the American League mark, with seven RBI in the sixth inning of the New York Yankees' final game of the 2009 season, played against the Tampa Bay Rays.\nUnder Major League Baseball rule 10.04, a batter is credited with a Run Batted In during most circumstances where the batter's action at bat causes one or more runs to score, as set forth in this Rule 10.04 As the most RBI that can be scored in a single at bat is four (with a grand slam, in which a home run is hit with the bases loaded), scoring five or more RBI in a single inning requires at least two at bats with runs batted in during each at bat in that one inning, all of which combines to make this an extremely rare occurrence.\nSince 1900, there have been 22 different players who have hit six or more RBI in a single inning. In 1911, Fred Merkle of the New York Giants became the first player in the modern era with six RBI in an inning and Bob Johnson became the first AL player to match the number when he did so in 1937.\nAll of the teams with a player with six or more RBI in an inning have won the game, usually in a blowout, though two of the games ended up with a two-run margin of victory: The Montreal Expos defeating the Chicago Cubs 17–15 in 1985 behind Andre Dawson, and the Boston Red Sox by a score of 19–17 over the Texas Rangers with David Ortiz providing six RBI in the first inning. The feat has been accomplished three times each by players on the Red Sox and Yankees. The Washington Senators / Minnesota Twins franchise has allowed a player to knock in six RBI in an inning on three occasions. Griffith Stadium, the home of the Senators, was the site of three games where a player had six RBI in an inning. A batter has knocked in six RBI in an inning in all but the eighth inning, and never in extra innings, with five players doing so in the first inning.\nRecord holders.\nTatís accomplished his major league baseball record in a game played by the St. Louis Cardinals on April 23, 1999, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. Dodger starting pitcher Chan Ho Park entered the game's third inning with a 2–0 lead, but would implode in that frame, giving up a total of 11 runs (six of them earned) on six hits, an error and 48 pitches in the inning before being relieved by Carlos Pérez who was able to get the third out of the inning on three pitches. With no outs, Park loaded the bases on two singles and a walk before Tatís hit a grand slam to deep left field on a 2–0 count. Three more runs scored before Tatís would again come to the plate with the bases loaded, belting his second grand slam with two outs and a full count, to give Tatís the MLB record for most RBI in an inning and becoming the only MLB player to have hit two grand slams in a single inning.\nAlex Rodriguez set the American League mark in a 10–2 victory by the Yankees over the Rays at Tropicana Field on the final day of the 2009 season. Rodriguez entered the game with 28 home runs and 93 RBI, leaving him likely to come up short in his bid for a 13th consecutive season of 30 home runs and 100 RBI. In the sixth inning, Rodriguez came to bat with two base runners after Johnny Damon led off with a double and Mark Teixeira walked. On the first pitch of his at bat, Rodriguez hit a home run off of Wade Davis to deep left field, scoring three runs. The Rays brought in Andy Sonnanstine to replace Davis and Rodriguez came to bat for the second time in the inning with three more runs having scored and the bases loaded after an intentional walk to Teixeira. With two outs and a count of 0–1, Rodriguez hit a grand slam to deep right center, giving him seven RBI for the inning to set the American League mark and setting an MLB record with his 13th consecutive season with 30 home runs and 100 RBI, breaking a tie of 12 seasons in a row with Jimmie Foxx, as well as with Manny Ramirez, who had 12 seasons non-consecutively. The 10 runs scored in the inning on six hits and a walk were the only runs the Yankees scored in the game.\nEarlier record holders.\nFred Merkle of the Giants was the first to accomplish the feat of knocking in six runs in one inning in the modern, post-1900 era. He did this on May 13, 1911, in a game against the Cardinals played at Manhattan's Hilltop Park. Cardinal starting pitcher Slim Sallee had already given up three hits and a walk and was replaced by Bob Harmon when Merkle came to bat for the first time in the inning with runners on first and third, hitting an inside-the-park home run that scored three runs. For his second at bat, Merkle faced Lou Lowdermilk, the third Cardinal pitcher of the inning, with the bases loaded. Merkle hit a double to knock in three more base runners. After Al Bridwell singled him to third, Merkle scored on a double steal.\nThough the Athletics had already been eliminated from the pennant race, they came out \"with a vengeance\", scoring 12 runs in the first inning of a doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park, breaking a record for runs in the first inning of 11 that had been set by the Red Sox on August 13, 1933. Bob Johnson was 5 for 6 with two home runs and 7 RBI, with the six RBI he knocked in during the first inning outburst setting a new American League record. In the first inning, he singled to knock in two runs on his first at bat and hit a grand slam in his second plate appearance to reach six RBI for the inning. Though the Athletics won the first game by a score of 19–0, they dropped game two by a score of 5–3.\nAfter dropping the first game of a doubleheader to the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium by a score of 4–0, the Red Sox came back to win the second game by a score of 15–4. In the second game, Tom McBride of the Red Sox came up twice in the fourth inning, clearing the bases in both at bats with a double and then a triple, yielding six runs to tie the record.\nAs part of a 12-run sixth inning, the Philadelphia Athletics scored a 16–5 win over the Washington Senators in a game played at Griffith Stadium. Joe Astroth went 3 for 5 in the game and tied the major league record for one inning, hitting a grand slam home run and a single to knock in another two runs.\nList of players with six or more RBI in one inning.\n23 players have knocked in six or more RBI in a single inning in MLB play since 1900. Though the current official designation of a Run Batted In was not officially set until 1920, the six RBI knocked in by Fred Merkle for the Giants in 1911 have been counted retrospectively using the modern definition of the statistic."

A strange match; it was split into 3 thirds of 30 minutes each; and the total playing time went to 100 minutes when summing when each third went dead. The Possibles raced into an early commanding lead but personnel movements saw the Scotland Probables side come back into the match. One of those personnel movements was the promotion of Leslie into the Probables side in the second third, with the \"Glasgow Herald\" noting that he had an excellent game throughout. Although the Probables eventually took a one-point lead in the match, the Possibles fought back at the end to win.\nInternational career.\nLeslie was capped by Scotland 'B' twice in the period 1974-75 while still with Dundee HSFP.\nLeslie was first capped against Ireland in 1975, but did not become a regular on the Scotland squad until 1981.\nLeslie spent much of his playing time injured, missing the 1977, 1978, 1979 Five Nations, and half of the 1980 season. He broke a leg in 1982, missing the 1982 Scotland rugby union tour of Australia.\nLeslie scored Scotland's first try against in 1984, only his second for Scotland.\nControversially, Leslie was left off the 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand. In 1984, he was voted \"Rugby World\"'s \"Player of the Season\", - the only ever Scottish winner - following his performances as an ever-present in the Grand Slam winning team of that year.\nRichard Bath writes of him that:\nThroughout his career, he was consistently the most focussed and fearless player in a Scottish squad which had more than its fair share of fearless breakaways... for all his intensity, Leslie found it hard to establish himself in the Scottish side until late on in his career.\nAllan Massie considered that:\nLeslie's first quality is courage. All back-row forwards have to be brave, but Leslie's courage defies reason and probability alike: he reckons any ball on the ground is his to win. The courage is so blinding that one is apt to overlook the skill, judgement and timing with which he launches himself at such balls and attaches himself to them. He is in fact a very skilful educated player (he often played fly-half in his schooldays). He gives and takes a pass better than most of the Scottish three-quarter line. He has acquired the knack of dipping his shoulder into the tackler and slipping the ball at the same moment to a supporting player. He kicks well. Perhaps though his greatest asset with the ball in his hand is his intuitive knowledge of what is right. Jim Telfer has said that he can stop worrying when Leslie has the ball, being 99 per cent sure that he will out it to the best use possible. This is a quality that many of even the best and most spectacular of back-row men never acquire."

        "text": "Hugh Ferns McLeod OBE (8 June 1932 – 12 May 2014) was a Scottish rugby union player, who played forty times for Scotland between 1954 and 1962. He played 14 times for the Barbarians between 1954 and 1959, scoring only once, a try in their 1958 match against East Africa in Nairobi on 28 May 1958 (though this is erroneously listed on the Barbarian website as earning 5 points whereas a try was only worth 3 points at the time). His home team was Hawick RFC. giving rise to his nickname, the Hawick Hardman. Allan Massie describes him as \"Hawick through and through, and is indeed now President of the Club\".\nInternational career.\nHugh McLeod propped alongside Tom Elliot of Gala RFC and David Rollo of Howe of Fife RFC. He was only twenty one when he first played for Scotland, a young age at the time, and retired from international rugby at thirty. He was made pack leader for a while, and the story goes that some of the posher, or anglified players could not actually understand his accent; one of his semi-humorous phrases as pack leader was \"Come here, my wee disciples.\"\nIn 1955 he took part in the British Lions tour of South Africa and afterwards published his diary of the tour (\"Hugh McLeod Diary - The British Lions Rugby Tour of South Africa 1955\"). In 1959 he played on the 1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand.\nRichard Bath writes of McLeod that he\nAllan Massie is equally flattering:\nHe was a personal friend of Bill McLaren, also from Hawick, who describes him as \"A man for whom I always have had the highest respect and admiration.\"\nOne of the Anglo-Scots is supposed to have said, \"Well, I didn't understand a word of that but it all sounded damned impressive.\".\nAnother famous story involving McLeod, and the lock Frans ten Bos and is told by Bill McLaren. On the evening before the 1963 game between and at Colombes in Paris, Hugh McLeod and Bill McLaren were out having a meal together and bumped into ten Bos near a cafe. Hugh McLeod took Ten Bos aside, and told him bluntly:\nTen Bos tapped McLaren on the shoulder as they left the cafe, and said, \"You know, I'd follow him anywhere.\"\nScotland later won the game 11-6, rare for an away game.\nMcLeod retired after forty caps, \"because forty is a nice roond figure.\" McLeod's hobby in later life has been dog shows mainly using his bulldog Spike. He died at the age of 81 on 12 May 2014."

The team begins training in mid September all the way until the end of March, ending the season with the Ivy League Championships also known as \"Ivies\". The team practices 9 times a week and has weekly competitions throughout the season. The team trains and also hosts competitions at the Dartmouth College Aquatic Facilities, swimming in the Karl Michael Pool and the Spaulding Pool. They also host an annual invite at the Upper Valley Aquatic Center in nearby White River Junction VT.\nSometime in 2002 as a result of economic/financial troubles, Dartmouth College made several budget cuts which involved disbanding the men and women's swim team. In response, the team as well as many others rallied to stop the team from getting cut, one student even putting the team up on eBay in an effort to gain attention and money to save the team. After successfully lobbying and fundraising for the team by students, alumni, and fans, both teams were reinstated under the John C. Glover Fund for the Support of Swimming and Diving. The fund was named after one of the greatest Dartmouth swimmers of all time, John C. Glover, who was an all American Swimmer in the class of 1955 that died while training for the Olympics at Yale University in 1956.\nThe team was again cut as a varsity sport on July 9, 2020, along with the Men's and Women's Golf teams and Men's Lightweight Crew under the pretense of budgetary concerns. Funding was also cut for the Hanover Country Club indefinitely, although the grounds will be maintained for the use of the varsity Cross-Country team. Despite telling student-athletes and the fifteen coaches and staff members who were losing their jobs that this move was a cost-cutting measure, Dartmouth also made clear in a list of FAQs that no amount of pledges or donations from alumni would convince the administration to consider re-establishing the teams at the varsity level. Both teams were again reinstated on January 29 due to a threatened title IX law suit. "

        "text": "The 2010 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2010 season. The 106th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Texas Rangers and the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants; the Giants won the series, four games to one, to secure their first World Series championship since and their first since relocating to San Francisco from New York City in 1958. The series began on Wednesday, , and ended on Monday, .\nIn their respective League Championship Series, the Rangers and the Giants eliminated the 2009 World Series teams—the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies—each in six games. The Rangers' victory in the AL Championship Series gave the franchise its first World Series appearance in its 50-year history, dating from their inauguration as the second Washington Senators club in 1961. Meanwhile, the victory in the NL Championship Series gave the Giants their fourth World Series appearance since moving to San Francisco prior to the 1958 season; their most recent appearance had been in the 2002 World Series, when they lost to the Anaheim Angels in seven games. Coincidentally, the Giants and Rangers faced off in the first regular-season interleague game, on , 1997, at the Ballpark in Arlington; Rangers reliever Darren Oliver, then in his first stint with the club, threw the game's first pitch.\nThe Giants had home-field advantage for the World Series (the first NL champions since ), because the NL won the All-Star Game, 3–1, on . For the second consecutive year, Series games were scheduled for earlier start times to attract younger viewers. First pitch was just before EDT for most games, with Game 3 starting at EDT as part of a \"family night\" promotion and Game 4 starting at EDT to accommodate Fox's NFL coverage.\nSan Francisco landmarks, such as Coit Tower, the Ferry Building, and San Francisco City Hall, were illuminated with orange lighting at night during the postseason. An exclusive VIP party was held on the eve of the World Series at the California Academy of Sciences (in Golden Gate Park); most media were not allowed near the event. San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom made a friendly wager with Arlington mayor Robert Cluck, agreeing that \"the losing city's mayor will travel to the winning city and join the winning city's mayor in a day of support for local youth and community service initiatives, with both mayors wearing the jersey of the World Series Champion team.\" With three games slated in Arlington, this marked the 5th time the same city hosted both a World Series game and the upcoming Super Bowl (Los Angeles –67, Minneapolis –92, Atlanta –2000, Tampa –09).\nBackground.\nTexas Rangers.\nThe Rangers and their fans had a long history of futility and disappointment. Enfranchised in 1961 as the second iteration of the Washington Senators, the team only had one season with a winning percentage above .500 out of 11 seasons in Washington, D.C.. The team relocated to Arlington, Texas, for the 1972 season but failed to make the postseason for over 20 years. Despite being 10 games under .500, the Rangers were leading the American League West division on , 1994, when the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike began and the remainder of the season was cancelled. They went on to win three division titles in 1996, 1998, and 1999, but were eliminated by the New York Yankees in the ALDS each time, having only won one game out of all three series combined. The Rangers' last postseason appearance before 2010 was in 1999. At the time, the Rangers were the only team to have never advanced past the first round of the playoffs and one of three (the others being the Seattle Mariners- who are still without a World Series appearance, and the Washington Nationals- who most recently won the World Series in 2019) to have never appeared in the World Series.\nHeading into 2010, the Rangers were plagued with off-field issues. During spring training, manager Ron Washington admitted to prior cocaine use and failing a drug test during the 2009 season. Additionally, the team's owner, Tom Hicks, had financial problems dating back to 2008, which culminated in the team declaring bankruptcy in May and being sold to a partnership led by Chuck Greenberg and team president Nolan Ryan in August.\nIn the offseason, Iván Rodríguez, Marlon Byrd, Omar Vizquel, and Andruw Jones all departed due to free agency. Kevin Millwood was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Chris Ray, who in turn was traded to the Giants mid-season. Notable offseason additions to the Rangers included starting pitcher Rich Harden, previously of the Chicago Cubs; starting pitcher Colby Lewis, previously of Nippon Professional Baseball's Hiroshima Toyo Carp; and designated hitter Vladimir Guerrero, previously of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Notable midseason roster moves include the aforementioned trade of Chris Ray to San Francisco in exchange for catcher Bengie Molina, and the trade of Justin Smoak and three minor-leaguers to the Seattle Mariners for starting pitcher Cliff Lee and relief pitcher Mark Lowe. The Rangers also traded two minor leaguers to the Florida Marlins in exchange for Jorge Cantú, and Joaquín Árias to the New York Mets in exchange for Jeff Francoeur.\nThe Rangers spent most of the season in first place in the American League West, with both the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Seattle Mariners failing to live up to expectations by ESPN critics. They took first place for good on , following a brief one-day stint in first place by the Angels, and finished the season with a 90–72 record, nine games ahead of the second-place Oakland Athletics. Their .556 winning percentage was the lowest among all eight 2010 postseason teams.\nIn the postseason, the third-seeded Rangers faced the top-seeded Tampa Bay Rays in the ALDS. The Rangers won the first two games at Tropicana Field by wide margins, bringing the Rays to the brink of elimination; however, the Rays won the next two games at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington to force a deciding Game 5 at Tropicana Field. Game 5 was another decisive Rangers victory, as ace Cliff Lee stymied the Rays and the offense struck Rays ace David Price once again. This was the first postseason series win in franchise history; additionally, the Rangers were the last team that had never won a postseason series. In the ALCS, the Rangers faced the wild-card winning New York Yankees, to whom they had lost all three of their previous postseason appearances. The Yankees had swept the second-seeded Minnesota Twins in their ALDS. The Rangers held a 5–0 lead in Game 1, only to see the Yankees come back and beat them 6–5. However, the next three games were all blowouts, as the Rangers took a 3–1 series lead. The Yankees won Game 5 by a large margin, but were once again routed in Game 6, 6–1, behind a series-winning hit by Vladimir Guerrero. Josh Hamilton's MVP performance included four home runs, tying an ALCS record, and helped the Rangers reach their first World Series. It also marked the first time since that the AL West champion won the pennant. The Angels' win was as the wild card team.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nLike the Rangers, the Giants and their fans had a long history of futility and disappointment since their move from New York City to San Francisco before the 1958 season. The Giants had won their last World Series against the Cleveland Indians in . After moving to San Francisco, enraged Giants fans in New York allegedly placed a hex on the franchise, starting the Curse of Coogan's Bluff that would last for over 50 years. Within that period, they made it to the World Series three times, but lost each time. These included a seven-game loss to the New York Yankees in , a four-game sweep by their cross-bay rival Oakland Athletics in that was marred by the Loma Prieta earthquake, and another seven-game loss to the Anaheim Angels in after being eight outs away from the title in Game 6 with a 5–0 lead. Their last postseason appearance was in 2003, when they lost to the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins in the NLDS.\nThe Giants entered 2010 with a strong pitching staff led by two-time Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum and a solid bullpen spearheaded by closer Brian Wilson. Notable offseason acquisitions included free agents Mark DeRosa, previously of the St. Louis Cardinals; and Aubrey Huff, previously of the Detroit Tigers. Over the course of the season, the Giants' front office made a series of moves to bolster their offense. Free agent Pat Burrell was signed in late May after he was released by the Tampa Bay Rays, while Buster Posey—who had started the season at Triple-A Fresno—was called up in late May and became the starting catcher after the Giants traded Bengie Molina to the Texas Rangers. In August, José Guillén was acquired in a trade with the Kansas City Royals, and Cody Ross was claimed off waivers from the Florida Marlins.\nThe Giants spent much of the early part of the season in second or third place in the National League West standings, trailing the San Diego Padres and on occasion the Los Angeles Dodgers or Colorado Rockies. They entered the All-Star break in fourth place, trailing the Padres, Rockies, and Dodgers. However, they finished July in second place behind the Padres, with a record of 20–8 for the month. On , the Padres began a ten-game losing streak that allowed the Giants to gain some ground. The Giants tied the Padres for first place on and the two teams traded the top spot for the next 15 days. Then, the Giants took the lead for good on , when they began a four-game winning streak coupled with the Padres' three-game losing streak. The Giants were three games ahead of the Padres going into the final weekend of the season, a three-game set between the two teams that the Padres needed to sweep in order to force a tie-breaker. The Padres won the first two games, but the Giants prevailed in the final game, 3–0, to clinch the franchise's seventh NL West championship.\nIn the Division Series, the second-seeded Giants faced the wild card-winning Atlanta Braves, who had also clinched a postseason berth on the last day of the regular season. Each game was decided by one run, with the Giants winning the series three games to one. The Giants won behind Lincecum's 14 strikeouts in Game 1 and earned come-from-behind wins in Games 3 and 4. In the NLCS, the Giants were heavy underdogs to the two-time defending National League champion Philadelphia Phillies, the overall #1 seed in the postseason. Ross' two home runs in Game 1 off Phillies ace Roy Halladay helped the Giants win the opener 4–3. They lost Game 2, but rebounded in Game 3 thanks to Matt Cain's strong performance and more timely hitting by Ross. Game 4 saw the Giants win on a walk-off sac fly by Juan Uribe. With the Phillies winning Game 5, 4–2, the series was sent back to Philadelphia. The Phillies took a 2–0 lead in the first inning of Game 6, but the Giants tied the game in the third and their steady bullpen held the Phillies' offense scoreless the rest of the way. This effort by the Giants bullpen included relief appearances by Tim Lincecum and Madison Bumgarner, who were both part of the Giants playoff rotation. In the eighth, Uribe hit a home run to right that barely cleared the wall and gave the Giants a 3–2 lead. Wilson came on for a five-out save to clinch the series. This marked the first time that the NL West champion had made it to the World Series since the Arizona Diamondbacks did so in (the Giants' 2002 appearance and the Colorado Rockies' appearance were both as wild card winners).\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe anticipated pitchers' duel between former Cy Young Award winners Cliff Lee and Tim Lincecum never materialized, as Lincecum gave up two early runs and Lee gave up seven runs—six of which were earned—in innings. In the first inning, Lincecum gave up a hit and a walk, respectively, to the first two batters he faced: Elvis Andrus and Michael Young. Andrus scored on a Vladimir Guerrero single that struck Lincecum's leg and bounced into right field. In the second, Bengie Molina singled, advanced to third on a Lee double, and scored on Andrus' sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the third inning, Édgar Rentería reached on an error and advanced to second when Lee hit Andrés Torres. Rentería scored on a Freddy Sanchez RBI double, and Torres scored on a Buster Posey RBI single, tying the game.\nIn the bottom of the fifth inning, Torres doubled and scored on another Sanchez double. Lee then walked Pat Burrell and gave up back-to-back singles to Cody Ross and Aubrey Huff, which scored Sanchez and Burrell, respectively. Lee was then relieved by Darren O'Day, who gave up a three-run home run to Juan Uribe that increased the Giants' lead to six runs. In the top of the sixth inning, Lincecum struck out the first two batters he faced, but walked Ian Kinsler, who scored on a Molina double. Molina advanced to third on a Mitch Moreland single and scored on a David Murphy single. Lincecum was then removed from the game, having gone innings.\nThe Giants piled on to their lead in the bottom of the eighth. Rangers reliever Mark Lowe gave up a single to Rentería, who advanced to third on a Vladimir Guerrero fielding error. Rentería then scored on pinch hitter Travis Ishikawa's double. Sanchez singled to score Ishikawa, and advanced to second on another Guerrero error. Lowe recorded one more out before being relieved by Michael Kirkman. Kirkman promptly gave up a single to Nate Schierholtz that scored Sanchez.\nIn the top of the ninth, Giants reliever Ramón Ramírez gave up a single to pinch hitter Julio Borbon and walked Andrus before being relieved by Jeremy Affeldt. Affeldt threw a wild pitch and walked Josh Hamilton to load the bases, and was relieved by closer Brian Wilson. Guerrero hit a sacrifice fly that scored Borbon, and Nelson Cruz doubled to score Andrus and Hamilton, but Kinsler popped out to end the game.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 started out as a pitching duel between San Francisco's Matt Cain and Texas' C. J. Wilson. Ian Kinsler led off the top of the fifth with a deep fly ball that was perhaps an inch short of a home run. The ball bounced high off the top of the center field wall and back into the field of play, forcing Kinsler to settle for a double. Cain did not allow him to score. In the bottom of the 5th inning, Édgar Rentería hit a home run into left field to give San Francisco a 1–0 lead. Texas threatened in the top of the sixth with back-to-back singles by Michael Young and Josh Hamilton, who both advanced into scoring position on Cain's wild pitch to Nelson Cruz. Cain subsequently got Cruz and Kinsler to pop out, ending the threat. The Giants added a run in the bottom of the seventh when Cody Ross walked, advanced to second base on a groundout by Aubrey Huff, and then scored on a single by Juan Uribe. Wilson was removed from the game with a blister in the seventh inning and was relieved by Darren Oliver. Cain went innings, allowing only four hits. Cain's outing was his third and final of the postseason, a playoff run in which he pitched innings without allowing an earned run.\nIn the eighth inning, Texas reliever Darren O'Day struck out Andrés Torres and Freddy Sanchez to record the first two outs. Buster Posey singled up the middle, and O'Day was relieved by Derek Holland. Holland walked Nate Schierholtz and Cody Ross to load the bases, then walked Huff to force in a run, increasing the Giants' lead to 3–0. Mark Lowe then relieved Holland, and walked Uribe to force in another run. Rentería then singled to left field, scoring Ross and Huff to increase the Giants' lead to 6–0. Lowe was then relieved by Michael Kirkman, who gave up a triple to pinch hitter Aaron Rowand, scoring Uribe and Rentería. Rowand then scored on an Andrés Torres double. Guillermo Mota retired the Rangers in the ninth to give the Giants a 2–0 series lead. Nate Schierholtz made a running catch to end the game.\nGame 3.\nAll runs scored in this game were produced by home runs. In the bottom of the second inning, Giants starter Jonathan Sánchez gave up a double to Nelson Cruz and walked Bengie Molina before giving up a three-run home run to Mitch Moreland. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Sánchez yielded a home run to Josh Hamilton, which would be the last batter he would face. Cody Ross and Andrés Torres cut the lead in half with home runs in the seventh and eighth, respectively, off Rangers starter Colby Lewis. Texas closer Neftalí Feliz pitched a perfect ninth to secure the Rangers' first and only victory of the series.\nThis was the first World Series game won by a team from Texas, as the Houston Astros were swept in .\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, the Giants sent 21-year-old rookie Madison Bumgarner to the hill against the Rangers' Tommy Hunter. Bumgarner was brilliant for San Francisco, hurling eight innings while allowing only three hits. Bumgarner allowed only one Ranger to reach second base. A two-run homer by Aubrey Huff in the third inning off Hunter was enough for the Giants win. The other two runs were scored on a run-scoring double by Andrés Torres in the seventh and a home run to dead center by Buster Posey in the eighth. Bumgarner also became the fifth-youngest pitcher to start a World Series game, and the fourth-youngest to win one. Bumgarner and Posey were the first rookie battery to start a World Series game since Spec Shea and Yogi Berra in .\nGame 5.\nGame 5 was a pitching rematch of Game 1 between former Cy Young Award winners Cliff Lee and Tim Lincecum. Down 3–1 in the series, the Rangers needed a win in their ballpark to send the Series back to San Francisco or the Giants would return home as champions. What resulted was the pitching duel anticipated in Game 1. Both Lee and Lincecum pitched six shutout innings, with Lincecum having allowed only two hits and Lee three. In the top of the seventh inning, Cody Ross and Juan Uribe singled back to back to put two runners on with no outs. The next Giant batter, Aubrey Huff, who had never laid down a bunt in his Major League career, successfully executed a sacrifice bunt, one where only a quick play by Lee prevented Huff from reaching base himself. Runners were now at second and third base for Pat Burrell. Lee struck out Burrell (10th time Burrell fanned in the Series), but then allowed a three-run homer on a 2–0 slider by Édgar Rentería to left center field, putting the Giants ahead 3–0.\nWith one out in the bottom of the seventh, Nelson Cruz had a home run that cut the deficit to 3–1 and broke an 18-inning scoreless streak for the Rangers—their longest drought of the entire season. Lincecum walked the next batter, Ian Kinsler, to bring the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the seventh but struck out the next two Texas batters to end the threat.\nRangers closer Neftalí Feliz pitched two scoreless innings, and Lincecum pitched a 1–2–3 eighth, keeping the score 3–1. Brian Wilson, the 2010 Major League saves champion (48 saves), relieved Lincecum in the bottom of the ninth. Facing the heart of Texas' order, Wilson made quick work of the first two batters, striking Josh Hamilton out looking on four pitches and getting Vladimir Guerrero to hit a grounder to Rentería at short on the first pitch. This brought Nelson Cruz to the plate as the last hope for Texas. Cruz worked the count to 3–2, but Wilson struck him out swinging to seal the championship for San Francisco.\nSan Francisco outscored Texas 29–12, and shut out the Rangers twice. The Giants became the second team in the 2010 postseason to record two shutouts in a series since the Philadelphia Phillies shut out the Cincinnati Reds twice in the NLDS. The Rangers were the first team to be shut out twice in the World Series since the Baltimore Orioles recorded three shut outs against the 1966 Los Angeles Dodgers en route to a sweep in the World Series. Édgar Rentería's three-run homer was the second World Series championship-clinching hit of his career, the first coming with the Florida Marlins in 1997. Rentería was named the MVP of the series, as he hit .412 (7 for 17) with six RBIs in the Series.\nComposite line score.\n2010 World Series (4–1): San Francisco Giants (NL) beat Texas Rangers (AL).\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nIn the United States, Fox televised the games, with Joe Buck calling play-by-play on his 13th World Series dating back to 1996 (which was also Fox's very first World Series), while Tim McCarver handled color commentary for the 21st time since 1985 (when McCarver worked for ABC). Ken Rosenthal also appeared on the Fox telecasts as a field reporter. MLB International syndicated its own telecast of the series, with announcers Gary Thorne and Rick Sutcliffe, to various networks outside the U.S. ESPN America broadcast the series live in the UK and in Europe.\nAdditionally, the American Forces Network and Canadian Forces Radio and Television carried the games to U.S. and Canadian service personnel stationed around the globe. Fox Deportes carried the Series in Spanish on American cable and satellite TV.\nHowever, many viewers in the New York City and Philadelphia markets were unable to watch Games 1 and 2 because News Corporation, Fox's parent company, pulled WNYW and WTXF from cable provider Cablevision on due to a carriage dispute. An agreement between the companies was reached just before Game 3.\nRatings.\nThe overall national Nielsen rating for the five games was 8.4, which, at the time, tied the 2008 World Series for the event's lowest-ever TV rating (the 2012 World Series would later draw a 7.6 rating to hold the record on its own). Game 4 was beaten in the ratings by a Pittsburgh Steelers–New Orleans Saints game on \"NBC Sunday Night Football\", the first time a World Series game was outdrawn by a regular-season NFL contest airing in the same time slot.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio also broadcast the World Series nationally, with Jon Miller (who worked the Giants' local radio broadcasts during the regular season) calling his 13th consecutive World Series as the network's play-by-play announcer, and Joe Morgan providing commentary on his 11th World Series for ESPN Radio and his 14th overall (counting three Series telecasts for NBC). The games were the last that Miller and Morgan (who had also been calling \"Sunday Night Baseball\" for ESPN television since 1990) would work together, as the network subsequently announced that their contracts would not be renewed for 2011. ESPN Deportes Radio also aired the Series to Spanish language listeners, with Eduardo Ortega and former Giants pitcher Juan Marichal announcing. In the UK, the Series was broadcast by BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra, with Jonny Gould and Josh Chetwynd commentating.\nLocally, the two teams' flagship stations broadcast the series with their respective announcing crews. The Giants' English-language broadcasts aired on KNBR (with Dave Flemming, Duane Kuiper, and Mike Krukow announcing) with their Spanish-language broadcasts on KIQI (with Erwin Higueros and Tito Fuentes), while KRLD-FM and AM carried the Rangers' English-language broadcasts (with Eric Nadel and Dave Barnett) and KFLC-AM had their Spanish-language broadcasts (with Eleno Ornelas and Jerry Romo). Due to contractual obligations, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games, although the local broadcasts were also available on XM Satellite Radio and to Gameday Audio subscribers at MLB.com.\nImpact and aftermath.\nThe Giants championship marked several firsts, not just for the team, but also for the city of San Francisco and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nThe firsts with the championship were:\nIn summing up the firsts, Larry Baer, the president of the Giants and a fourth generation resident of San Francisco, said that the team dedicated the championship to \"53 years of San Francisco Giants players and coaches and managers...millions of fans.\"\nThe Giants held a victory parade on November 3, following the same parade route that the team used when they moved to the city. With some estimates of a million fans lining the route, the parade and rally at City Hall was the largest event ever in the city of San Francisco. Transit agency BART set an all-time single day record for ridership, breaking its previous record by almost 20%.\nReplaced by Buster Posey midway during the 2010 season, Bengie Molina was traded to the Rangers, reaching the World Series against the Giants. Despite being on the losing team, Molina received a championship ring, becoming just the sixth player to play for both World Series teams in the same season.\nWhile losing Cliff Lee to free agency to Philadelphia, the Texas Rangers bolstered their line-up by signing third baseman Adrian Beltre. The next season, the Rangers won the AL West title for the second consecutive season, after leading that division for much of the season, eventually making it back to the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, losing to them in seven games, after being one strike away from the title, twice in Game 6.\nThe Giants' 2010 World Series championship was followed by two further World Series titles in and ; however, they missed the playoffs in between those championship seasons. Those three World Series titles in five seasons qualified as a dynasty, according to the criteria devised by statistician Bill James.\nWith the Giants' first World Series championship in San Francisco, the National Hockey League's San Jose Sharks remain the only Bay Area franchise without a world championship. The Sharks would reach the Stanley Cup finals for the 2015-2016 season, but ultimately lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games.\nTwo key contributors from the San Francisco Giants would eventually join the Texas Rangers. Tim Lincecum signed a one-year contract with the Rangers on March 7, 2018. On October 21, 2022, the Rangers hired Bruce Bochy as their new manager, who led the Rangers to their first World Series championship title in his first season as Rangers manager in 2023."

        "title": "Cycling in Illinois",
        "text": "Cycling in Illinois encompasses recreation, bikeways, laws and rules, and advocacy. The director of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Joel Brunsvold, explained Illinois cycling opportunities:\n“Bicycle riding is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities in Illinois, enjoyed by young and old alike...Illinois has a variety of trails for the public to enjoy. The terrain includes flat prairie land to rolling hills, towering bluffs to the breathtaking river and lakefront views.” \nMany communities across the state are updating bicycle infrastructure in order to accommodate the increased number of cyclists on the roads.\nRecreation.\nIllinois has a lively bike culture with many clubs, groups, and places to ride. One can find a road, cyclocross, and mountain bike racing as well as non-competitive and charity rides across the state.\nThe Illinois Cycling Association promotes amateur bicycle racing by hosting a race calendar and database of racing clubs/team. The types of races listed on the calendar consist of road, criterium, track, and cyclocross. \nOne of the notable non-competitive bicycle events in Illinois is Bike the Drive. It is an opportunity for cyclists to ride a 15 mile stretch of Lake Shore Drive (Chicago) without any automobile traffic. During the 2009 Bike the Drive, the drive was closed to automobile traffic from 5:30 am to 10:30 am. Each cyclist chooses his own route from the 30 mile (round trip) course and rides at his own pace. Riders may ride the course as many times as possible during the specified event time.\nLaws and rules.\nWhile there are some Illinois laws specific to bicycles, generally, bicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as roadway users. Since bicyclists have the same rights, motorists must be aware of and interact with bicyclists appropriately and lawfully. Bicyclists are responsible for obeying all of the applicable rules for motorists as well as obeying all bicycle specific laws when traveling on public roadways.\nMotorists interacting with bicyclists.\nMotorists are legally obligated to:\nBicyclists interacting with motorists.\nBicyclists are required to adhere to Illinois traffic laws unless otherwise specified. In addition, there are rules governing bicyclists' behavior in certain situations.\nLane position.\nWhen traveling at a slower speed than vehicular traffic, bicyclists must ride as close to the right-hand edge as is safe and practical. Exceptions include: when passing another bicycle or vehicle traveling in the same direction, when preparing for a left turn, when necessary to avoid objects or road hazards, when traveling on a road of width too narrow for bicycles and motorized vehicles to safely travel side by side, when preparing for an authorized right hand turn, when traveling on a one lane road with two or more lanes (bicyclist can ride on left-hand side).\nLeft turns.\nWhen preparing for a left turn, a bicyclist may choose from two styles of turns: vehicular and pedestrian. A vehicular-style turn, as the name implies, mimics the procedure of the motor vehicle. The bicyclist moves (after signaling) to the left turn lane or left side of the lane (in the absence of a left turn lane). Proceed with the turn according to traffic signals. When executing a pedestrian-style turn, the bicyclist remains on the right-hand side of the roadway and proceeds through the cross street, stopping at the corner. From this point, the bicyclist may proceed in the new direction, yielding to traffic and obeying traffic signals.\nHand signals.\nBicyclists must use hand signals when preparing to turn or stop.\nSignal a left turn by extending the left arm horizontally.\nSignal a right turn by:\nSignal slowing/stopping by extending the left arm horizontally, bending at the elbow, and pointing down with a flat/open hand.\nRiding at night.\nRiding a bicycle at night requires special attention. When operating a bicycle at nighttime, a bicycle must be equipped with (and be operating) a functional, white lamp that is visible from at least 500 ft. In addition, the bicycle must be mounted with an Illinois Department of Transportation approved, red reflector visible from 100 – 600 ft.\nAdvocacy.\nAdvocacy groups exist to promote the needs and interests of bicyclists. The needs of bicyclists include improving riding conditions/access, educating cyclists about laws and safety, educating motorists about laws and safety, and sharing the benefits of riding a bike with the general public.\nBikeways.\nIllinois has both multi-use and dedicated bike paths throughout the state. IDOT (Illinois Department of Transportation) provides nine regional interactive maps. The maps include information on the location of dedicated bike infrastructure. Also, included is an assessment of the bike friendliness of public roadways. According to the League of Illinois Bicyclists, these IDOT maps are the best place for information about rural roadways."

The league is governed by the International Ice Hockey Federation and founded in 2009 by the country’s Winter Sports Federation and the Emirates Olympic Committee. The Scorpions and Mighty Camels are composed of expatriate players, including Canadians, working in the U.A.E., while the other clubs consist of mostly Emirati players who form the United Arab Emirates national team.\nIn November 2018, Vladimir Burdun, a former karate champion who had lived in Dubai since the mid-1990s, was appointed as the new president of the League. He planned to eventually field at least one Emirates team in the international, professional Kontinental Hockey League by 2021. \"The main goal of the EHL management is to improve the quality of the league and bring new exposure to the level of play and create bridges with one of the best leagues in Europe, the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)\", he said. At about the same time, Dmitry Butenko was appointed as Managing Director of EHL. A new ice arena was expected to open in Dubai, possibly before the end of 2019, with a seating capacity of 17,000, and that venue would meet all the requirements of the KHL. (Preliminary plans for a major arena in Abu Dhabi were also underway in 2018.)\nIn April 2018, the Dubai Mighty Camels won the fourth title of Emirates Hockey League, becoming the major winner of the competition while in 2019, the champions were the Abu Dhabi Storms."

For the same reasons, HASK Zagreb played only two games in the first part of the regular season so the season continued, and finished, with only four teams.\nPlayoffs.\nThe first semi-final offered a matchup between Zagreb and Mladost, two teams that developed a rivalry during the season. The tensions were high, but somewhat surprisingly, young players from Mladost showed more composure and won the penalty-filled best-of-three series 2–0, thus advancing to their first final series.\nThe other semi-final was pretty much a one-sided affair as Medvescak advanced to the finals with two lopsided wins against their farm team, Medveščak II.\nMedvescak dominated the final, sweeping the series 3–0 against a young team that looked like they were pleased just to reach this stage and failed to show flair and desire that was expected of them. Nevertheless, Mladost should seriously challenge for the title in the coming years, once their young players grow up (there were several fifteen-, sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds on that team) and gain some valuable experience.\nZagreb won the third-place by winning all 3 games against Medveščak II."

        "text": "Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud is a brand of specially prepared mud used to prepare balls in the sport of baseball before they are put into play. Newly manufactured baseballs have a somewhat slick and glossy surface, so when new they are rubbed down with the mud to reduce the slickness and give pitchers a firmer grip and better control without damaging or discoloring the ball.\nHistory.\nBefore the discovery of the rubbing mud, baseballs were rubbed in a mixture of water and infield soil, but this method usually discolored the ball's leather surface. Other alternatives at the time were tobacco juice, shoe polish, and soil from under stadium bleachers. They were able to successfully take off the sheen from baseballs, but at the same time, they also damaged and scratched the ball's leather. While Lena Blackburne was a third-base coach for the Philadelphia Athletics (now based in Oakland, California), an umpire complained to him about the method used at the time, prompting Blackburne in 1938 to set out in search of better mud to use to rub against baseballs. Later that decade, Blackburne discovered the rubbing mud's location (said to be \"near\" Palmyra, New Jersey) and founded the company that he used to sell it – Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud. According to the company, the entire American League used the mud soon after its discovery, and by the 1950s, it was in use by every Major League Baseball (MLB) team, along with some minor league and college teams.\nWhen advancing age prevented him from harvesting the mud, Blackburne, who died in 1968, left the company to a friend, John Haas; according to the company, Haas had accompanied Blackburne during his searches for an appropriate mud. Haas later left the company to his son-in-law Burns Bintliff, who in turn selected one of his nine children, current owner Jim, to carry on the business. Jim Bintliff told CNN in 2009 that the company only brought in about $20,000 per year; at the time, he worked full-time as a printing press operator.\nThe mud originates from the New Jersey side of the Delaware River. The mud is cleaned and screened before sale. Each year Jim Bintliff visits the mud's source and returns with of it to store over the winter and sells it the following baseball season. Bintliff told CNN:\nIf anybody happens to catch me in the act of harvesting mud, I come up with a story to give them a reason I'm putting mud in a bucket. I've told people I use it in my garden, I use it for my rose bushes, I use it for bee stings and poison ivy and any kind of story.\nUsage.\nBefore all MLB and MiLB games, an umpire or clubhouse attendant rubs six dozen or more balls with the mud to give them a rougher surface, to make them easier for pitchers to grip, and to comply with MLB Rule 4.01(c), which states that all baseballs shall be \"properly rubbed so that the gloss is removed.\" The rubbing mud's unique feature is that it is \"very fine, like thick chocolate pudding\", and it has been considered the \"perfect baseball-rubbing mud\"."

In the early days it was an informally organised competition that took place during the school holidays. Today it attracts a considerable field of junior golfers from Great Britain and Ireland and offers boys and girls the opportunity to experience a major tournament and ultimately bid to become the Junior Golf Champion. In recent years around 40,000 juniors have taken part in the qualifying round.\nIt is open to all permanent British and Irish residents under the age of 18 at the start of the year. A handicap of 28 and below for boys and 36 and below for girls is required.\nFormat.\nThe finals of the Abu Dhabi Junior Golf Championship, in association with The Telegraph, will feature 10 boys who qualify via the leaderboard, one boy who will receive a sponsor’s invite, the girls' defending champion Hayley Davis, seven girls who qualify via the leaderboard and one girl who will receive a sponsor’s invite . The winner of the Abu Dhabi Golf Club Junior Open, which took place the month before, will also complete the 21-strong field.\nBefore the finals begin, a challenge match will take place, in which 21 of the UAE and Middle East’s best young players will compete with the visitors.\nHistory.\nSuccess in the tournament has acted as a springboard for some exceptional young golfers, with past winners including Justin Rose and Andrew Coltart, who have gone on to play at the highest level. Current boys and girls champions Stiggy Hodgson and Carly Booth have both represented Great Britain and Ireland in amateur tournaments.\nOther past champions of note include Mhairi McKay, Rebecca Hudson and Oliver Fisher.\nWinners.\nBoys\nGirls\nAbu Dhabi's sponsorship.\nAbu Dhabi Tourism Authority have Title Sponsored the event since 2009 Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority (ADTA).\nThe involvement of ADTA, which manages and develops the emirate’s tourism industry, is part of its strategy to market Abu Dhabi as a premier golfing destination.\nAbu Dhabi is home to the annual Abu Dhabi Golf Championship, a European Tour event that, along with the Qatar Masters and the Dubai Desert Classic, forms part of the early-season Gulf Swing of January and February each year.\nLike the ADJGC, the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship is held at the Abu Dhabi Golf Club.\n2009 championship.\nChris Lloyd completed a thrilling finish to the tournament by overhauling long-time leader Tom Lewis to take the boys title. In the girls match, Alexandra Peters held on to her overnight lead on the final day to take the trophy.\nLloyd played a winning final round of 73 to beat Lewis, who had led by eight shots at the end of the first round and four shots going into the final day's play. Lloyd, 17, from Bristol, bore down on Lewis and took the lead on the 12th hole. With a one shot lead going into the final hole he held his nerve to win with a final score of 11 under. Tomasz Anderson took third place with a score of four over.\nPeters clinched the girls’ championship with a final score of five under, leaving her well ahead of nearest rival Jessica Wilcox who ended the tournament on level par. The 16-year-old, from Shifnal, Nottinghamshire, had gone into the final day with a four-shot lead and never looked in danger of losing it.\nFinishing strongly, Wilcox jumped into second place helped by a run of three birdies on the front nine, ahead of Holly Clyburn and Heidi Baek who both recorded scores of three over.\n2008 championship.\nStiggy Hodgson holed a 15-ft birdie putt on the second playoff hole to beat Tommy Fleetwood and win the 2008 Abu Dhabi Junior Golf Championship boys title. The two leaders finished 12 shots ahead of the field by finishing 12 under par over the three rounds.\nHodgson, who plays with an unorthodox swing with its exaggerated head turn, did not drop a shot until the last hole, a poor bunker recovery and three-putt against Fleetwood's seventh birdie, cancelling out a seemingly decisive two-stroke lead to take the final into sudden death. \nCarly Booth, meanwhile, was untroubled by any of the competing girls as she decisively took the title. Her win by six shots at four under illustrated her mastery of the Abu Dhabi Golf Club’s National course."

They defeated top-ranked and two-time defending champion Cincinnati Bearcats in a 60–58 overtime contest. The 1962–63 Ramblers were one of the first NCAA men's basketball teams to have broken the so-called \"gentlemen's agreement\" among coaches in which no more than two black players would be on the floor at one time (and in some road games, black players would have to rotate so that only one of them was playing at any given moment): the Ramblers would regularly have three or four black starters, paving the way for the 1965–66 Texas Western Miners men's basketball team who would finally put the \"agreement\" to rest and have an all-black starting five. They played in the Game of Change, in which a Mississippi State team defied segregationists to play against Loyola, breaking the unwritten law that Mississippi teams would not play against black players.\nOn July 11, 2013, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their championship, surviving members of Loyola's team were honored by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the Oval Office of the White House.

        "text": "The Indonesia Basketball League (IBL; ) is the preeminent men's professional basketball league in Indonesia, founded by Indonesian Basketball Association (Perbasi) in 2003. From 2010 to 2015 it was known as the National Basketball League (NBL) and organised by DBL Indonesia. In 2016, PT Bola Basket Indonesia acquired Starting5 and after that PT Bola Basket Indonesia assigned by PP Perbasi to organised the league.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nBasketball has a long history in Indonesia. Noted since the 1930s, although not yet officially an independent country, several cities in Indonesia have their own local clubs.\nAlthough it does not yet have a national sports parent, at the time of the holding of the first National Sports Week held in Solo in 1948, basketball had become one of the sports branches that was contested and was received quite lively both in terms of participants and spectators. Three years after, on 23 October 1951, Perbasi was born.\nFollowing the results of the VIII Congress in 1981, Perbasi finally organised a competition between basketball clubs in Indonesia which are the highest competition followed by big clubs from the islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan and Sulawesi.\n3 April 1982 is a historic date for the basketball world in Indonesia. On that day, the match between the Rajawali Jakarta club against the Sinar Surya Yogyakarta Spirit marked the start of the first Main Basketball Competition (Kobatama) as well as the first step in the long history of the competition of top clubs in Indonesia. Jakarta Muda Indonesia listed themselves as the first club to win the prestigious Kobatama Champion title. Kobatama as an amateur basketball competition rolled out for 20 years and continued until it stopped in 2010.\nFounding: IBL started (2003–09).\nIn 2003, the inaugural season of the Indonesian Basketball League (IBL) professional competition was held. 12 teams participated in the IBL inaugural season from 6 cities around Indonesia: Bandung, Bogor, Jakarta, Salatiga, Surabaya, and Yogyakarta. The league was organized independently by Perbasi until 2010. Aspac Jakarta succeeded in becoming the first title winner in 2003.\nIn 2004, Satria Muda emerged as a new force to get rid of Aspac in the grand final and appear as a champion. Aspac won the title of champion again in 2005. The following years (2006–09) belonged to Satria Muda Jakarta.\nIn addition to the annual regular competition, IBL also holds an IBL Cup Tournament at the beginning or end of the season. In 2009, Satria Muda Jakarta defeated Pelita Jaya Jakarta in the final held at GOR C-Tra Arena Bandung. In 2008, Garuda Bandung managed to steal the previous IBL Cup Tournament title, in 2006 and 2007 also belonged to Satria Muda.\nUnfortunately, the development of IBL did not go as expected. After repeatedly changing promoters, the league threatened to disband at the end of 2009.\nUnder DBL: NBL (2010–15).\nAll participating club representatives also asked PT DBL Indonesia to manage and to operate the league. Previously, DBL Indonesia was considered to be successful in managing the Development Basketball League (DBL), the largest student basketball league in Indonesia, which in 2010 had expanded to 21 cities in Indonesia, followed by around 25,000 players and officials.\nTo restore the prestige of this professional league, re-branding is inevitable. Starting in 2010 until 2015, IBL, operated by DBL Indonesia, changed its name to the Indonesian National Basketball League (NBL). A number of changes were made, trying to increase the number of matches again, bringing the league closer to its fans.\n\"IBL Reborn\" (2015–present).\nIn 2015, Perbasi chose Starting5 to be the league operator. Dubbed the 'IBL Reborn', the league's name was change back to IBL from NBL. IBL then began to gain momentum and garnered nationwide support year by year.\nIn 2017, the league began to allow clubs to sign foreign players limited by salary cap and height restriction regulations.\nDraft.\nNote : *The player didn't play in IBL Seasons\nin the upcoming season of the IBL, the draft system would not continue."

A win over fourth-ranked rival Ohio State gave the Wolverines the Big Ten title and they came into the Rose Bowl ranked fourth.\nWashington Huskies.\nIn their third season under head coach Don James and quarterback Warren Moon, Washington stumbled out of the gate, losing three of their first four games, all out of conference. They then won six of seven, losing at UCLA on October 29 (later vacated by the Bruins, due to ineligible players). The Huskies won the Pac-8 title and earned the Rose Bowl berth when UCLA lost its final game on a last second field goal to USC, Washington entered the game ranked thirteenth in the AP poll, and tied for fourteenth in the UPI coaches poll.\nAftermath.\nWith Notre Dame beating top-ranked and undefeated Texas in the Cotton Bowl, Michigan had hopes that a dominant win over Washington would boost the Wolverines to the national title. The Huskies' dramatic upset ended those hopes, and Notre Dame was voted first in the polls among five one-loss teams; Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, and Penn State were the others. Michigan dropped to ninth in the final AP poll and Washington climbed to tenth; both were a spot higher in the UPI coaches poll."

The Wolverines tied for the Big Ten title with Michigan State, and earned the Rose Bowl berth because the Spartans were on probation. Michigan had been to the previous two Rose Bowls, \nUSC.\nUSC came into the game ranked third in both major polls with an 11–1 record. In September, USC decisively defeated then #1 ranked Alabama 24–14 in Birmingham, but subsequently suffered their lone defeat to new Pac-10 member Arizona State, falling 20–7 in Tempe in mid-October. USC defeated UCLA 17–10 to win the Pac-10, and then closed out the regular season by defeating defending national champion Notre Dame USC had also defeated Big-10 regular season co-champion Michigan State in late September. The Trojans entered the game as five-point \nCharles White's \"Phantom Touchdown\".\nUSC had driven deep into Michigan territory in the second quarter. At the three-yard line in a dive over the middle towards the goal-line, Charles White was hit hard by Michigan's great middle linebacker Ron Simpkins and fumbled the ball before he entered the end-zone. The ball was recovered by co-captain linebacker Jerry Meter. The officials for this game were made up of a Pac-10/Big Ten crew. Upon White's fumble, the umpire (a Pac-10 official) immediately and correctly marked the ball around the one-yard line and signaled that there had been a change of possession. Then the line judge, a Big Ten official, came running in raising his hands signaling that White had scored This touchdown has become known as White's \"Phantom Touchdown\" as he was awarded the score after first fumbling, and entered the end-zone without the ball. This has been confirmed by White himself.\nThe touchdown put USC up 14–3 and they added a field goal before halftime. The only score in the second half was an extended play by Michigan in the third quarter that resulted in a 44-yard touchdown pass.\nEarthquake.\nA mild earthquake, 4.6 on the Richter scale, took place shortly before halftime but caused \nAftermath.\nEarlier in the day at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, #2 Alabama upset #1 Penn State, 14–7.

        "title": "Women's Basketball Coaches Association",
        "text": "The Women's Basketball Coaches Association is an association of coaches of women's basketball teams at all levels.\nThe organization was formed in 1981, with the goal of addressing the needs of women's basketball coaches.\nThe mission of the WBCA is:\nThe WBCA provides education for coaches, and promotes the coaching profession with awards for coaches and players. While many of the awards are related to basketball activities, the WBCA recognizes the need for academic as well as athletic excellence and recognizes academic excellence with their Academic Top 25 Team Honor Roll.\nHistory.\nAn organizational meeting was held at the Olympic Festival in Syracuse, New York, in 1981. Jill Hutchison was named the first president of the organization, before the organization even had a name. Later that year, Betty Jaynes was named the interim executive director of the organization. Jaynes was the head coach of the James Madison University women's basketball team, but she resigned her position to take on the responsibilities of the WBCA. She served as the chief executive officer until retiring in November 2000, passing over the position to Beth Bass. Bass joined the organization as executive director in 1997, and assumed the role of CEO after the retirement of Jaynes, who continues to serve as a consultant to the WBCA.\nMembership.\nThe membership is open to virtually everyone, including institutions. The main membership category is \"active\" comprising the coaching staff of NCAA Divisions I, II, and III, as well as NAIA, USCAA, junior college and community college coaches. In addition, there are membership categories for high school, AAU and recreational league coaches, as well as coaches on professional teams. Institutions are allowed to become members. Finally, there are affiliate categories for \"administrators\", \"industry professionals\" (including media), players, and \"fans\" (including anyone who is a friend of women's basketball). An \"international\" membership category is available for individuals, regardless of category, living outside the U.S. and its territories. All members are eligible to attend the WBCA's annual convention except for high school and college players.\nThe WBCA membership is considerably broader than that of the WBCA's men's counterpart, the National Association of Basketball Coaches:\nEvents and initiatives.\nThe WBCA sponsors a variety of events throughout the year. The flagship event is the annual convention, coinciding both in timing and location with the Final Four weekend of the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship. Other sponsored events occur throughout the year, some in conjunction with the annual convention, others at different times.\nConvention.\nThe primary function of the convention is to facilitate business meetings, such as board of directors meetings, and other administrative meetings. The program also typically includes panel presentations including members and outside speakers, workshops, awards and outside exhibitors.\nWBCA High School All-America Game.\nThe WBCA formerly sponsored an All America game, inviting twenty of the nation's top high school female basketball players. Only seniors in high school were eligible. In addition to the twenty players invited to play in the game, an additional twenty players were named as Honorable Mention All-Americans. The invited players were divided into two teams, and played an all star game in the same city as the Final Four (although sometimes at a different venue). The game was typically scheduled for the off day between the semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nSo You Want To Be A Coach.\nThe WBCA sponsors a program aimed at ethnically minority female basketball players who show an interest in becoming coaches. The program is organized in parallel with the annual convention, at the same locations, and includes a \"two and a half day crash course in what the coaching profession entails\". Supporters of the program include some of the major names in the sport such as Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer\nWBCA Pink Zone.\nThe major charitable initiative of the WBCA encourages coaches to raise awareness of breast cancer in various ways. Each year, a number of women's basketball games are designed Pink Zone games. One or both of the teams wear pink uniforms. The event is usually coupled with a money raising effort; the proceeds are dedicated to the Kay Yow/WBCA Cancer Fund, in partnership with The V Foundation. The NCAA participates with their \"Calling for a Cure\" campaign. As part of that campaign, the referees in NCAA women's basketball games use pink whistles during the designated Pink Zone dates.\nAwards.\nThe WBCA sponsors a number of awards, with the intention to promote the development of the game. Awards are given for overall achievements by players and coaches, as well as broadcasters, administration, and academic results.\nPlayers awards.\nPlayer of the Year Awards.\nThe State Farm Wade Trophy is awarded annually to \"the best women's college basketball player in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I\".\nThe State Farm/WBCA Players of the Year award is the counterpart to the Wade trophy for the best women's basketball player in:\nThe Defensive Player of the Year is awarded to the best defensive collegiate Division I player.\nThe Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award was awarded to the most outstanding senior Division I female basketball player 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) or shorter (the maximum height was previously 5 feet 6 inches or 1.68 m).\nAll-America Teams.\nThe WBCA selects the top ten players in each of five divisions:\nCoaches Awards.\nThe WBCA presents an award to the National Coach of the Year in each of six divisions:\nThe WBCA presents an award to the Rookie Coach of the Year. The award is named in honor of Maggie Dixon, the former coach of the Army women's basketball team, who died shortly after competing her rookie season as a coach.\nThe NCAA and WBCA jointly award a Coaches trophy, presented to the team that finishes first in the USA TODAY ESPN Division I Top 25 Coaches' Poll.\nThe WBCA presents the Carol Eckman Award, given annually since 1986, to the women's college basketball active coach who \"best demonstrates the character of the late Carol Eckman, the mother of the collegiate women's basketball national championship\". The award is named for former women's head coach Carol Eckman, a head coach best known for establishing the first National Invitational Women's Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament in 1969.\nIn the 2015–16 season, the WBCA announced a new award recognizing the young coaches in the sport. This recognition was created to honor thirty of the up-and-coming women's basketball coaches age 30 and under in the sport at all levels of the game.″ In 2016, the WBCA also began awarding an Assistant Coach of the Year award.\nAcademic Awards.\nThe WBCA recognizes the need for academic as well as athletic excellence, and promotes academic excellence with its Academic Top 25 Team Honor Roll, recognizing the top 25 teams, as measured by overall GPA, in each of five divisions:\nMedia Awards.\nThe WBCA presents an annual scholarship award, The Robin Roberts/WBCA Broadcasting Scholarship, to a female basketball player intending to pursue graduate work and a career in sports journalism. Past recipients include Stacey Dales.\nThe WBCA presents an annual award to a member of the media who \"has best displayed a commitment to women's basketball and to advancing the role of the media in promoting the women's game\".\nThe inaugural award (1991) was presented to Mel Greenberg.

        "title": "History of swimming",
        "text": "Swimming was part of the first modern Olympic games in 1896 in Athens. In 1908, the world swimming association, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed.\nAncient times.\n10,000-year-old rock paintings of people swimming were found in the Cave of Swimmers near Wadi Sura in southwestern Egypt. These pictures seem to show breaststroke or doggy paddle, although it is also possible that the movements have a ritual meaning unrelated to swimming. An Egyptian clay seal dated between 9000 BC and 4000 BC shows four people who are believed to be swimming a variant of the front crawl.\nMore references to swimming are found in the Babylonian and Assyrian wall drawings, depicting a variant of the breaststroke. The most famous drawings were found in the Kebir desert and are estimated to be from around 4000 BC. The Nagoda bas-relief also shows swimmers inside of men dating back from 3000 BC. The Indian palace Mohenjo Daro from 2800 BC contains a swimming pool sized 12 m by 7 m. The Minoan palace of Knossos in Crete also featured baths. An Egyptian tomb from 2000 BC shows a variant of front crawl. Depictions of swimmers have also been found from the Hittites, Minoans and other Middle Eastern civilizations, in the Tepantitla compound at Teotihuacan, and in mosaics in Pompeii.\nWritten references date back to ancient times, with the earliest as early as 2000 BC. Such references occur in works like \"Gilgamesh\", the \"Iliad\", the \"Odyssey\", the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), \"Beowulf\", and other sagas, although the style is never described. There are also many mentions of swimmers in the Vatican, Borgian and Bourbon codices. A series of reliefs from 850 BC in the Nimrud Gallery of the British Museum shows swimmers, mostly in a military context, Often using swimming aids.\nEarly modern era.\nSince swimming was done in a state of undress, it became less popular as society became more conservative in the Early Modern period. Leonardo da Vinci made early sketches of lifebelts. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, \"Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu\" (\"The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read\"). His purpose was to reduce the dangers of drowning. The book contained a good methodical approach to learning breaststroke, and mentioned swimming aids such as air-filled cow bladders, reed bundles, and cork belts.\nIn 1587, Everard Digby also wrote a swimming book, claiming that humans could swim better than fish. Digby was a Senior Fellow at St. John's College, Cambridge and was interested in the scientific method. His short treatise, \"De arte natandi\", was written in Latin and contained over 40 woodcut illustrations depicting various methods of swimming, including the breaststroke, backstroke and crawl. Digby regarded the breaststroke as the most useful form of swimming. In 1603, Emperor Go-Yozei of Japan declared that schoolchildren should swim.\nIn 1595, Christopher Middleton wrote \"A short introduction for to learn to swim\", that was the first published guide recording drawings and examples of different swimming styles.\nIn 1696, the French author Melchisédech Thévenot wrote \"The Art of Swimming\", describing a breaststroke very similar to the modern breaststroke. This book was translated into English and became the standard reference of swimming for many years to come. In 1793, GutsMuths from Schnepfenthal, Germany, wrote \"Gymnastik für die Jugend\" (\"Exercise for youth\"), including a significant portion about swimming. In 1794, Kanonikus Oronzio de Bernardi of Italy wrote a two volume book about swimming, including floating practice as a prerequisite for swimming studies.\nIn 1798, GutsMuths wrote another book \"Kleines Lehrbuch der Schwimmkunst zum Selbstunterricht\" (\"Small study book of the art of swimming for self-study\"), recommending the use of a \"fishing rod\" device to aid in the learning of swimming. His books describe a three-step approach to learning to swim that is still used today. First, get the student used to the water; second, practice the swimming movements out of the water; and third, practice the swimming movements in the water. He believed that swimming is an essential part of every education. The Haloren, a group of salt makers in Halle, Germany, greatly advanced swimming through setting a good example to others by teaching their children to swim at a very early age.\nSwimming as a competitive sport.\nSwimming emerged as a competitive sport in the early 1800s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths, was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around London. The sport grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association, was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country.\nIn 1844 a swimming competition was held in London with the participation of two Native Americans. The British competitor used the traditional breaststroke, while the Native Americans swam a variant of the front crawl, which had been used by people in the Americas for generations, but was not known to the British. The winning medal went to 'Flying Gull' who swam the 130-foot length in 30 seconds – the Native American swimming method proved to be a much faster style than the British breaststroke. \"The Times\" of London reported disapprovingly that the Native American stroke was an unrefined motion with the arms \"like a windmill\" and the chaotic and unregulated kicking of the legs. The considerable splashing that the stroke caused was deemed to be barbaric and \"un-European\" to the British gentlemen, who preferred to keep their heads over the water. Subsequently, the British continued to swim only breaststroke until 1873. The British did, however, adapt the breaststroke into the speedier sidestroke, where the swimmer lies to one side; this became the more popular choice by the late 1840s. In 1895, J. H. Thayers of England swam in a record-breaking 1:02.50 using a sidestroke.\nSir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from South American natives he observed swimming on a trip to Buenos Aires. On his return to England in 1868, he successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 and won a local competition in 1875. Although the new stroke was really the reintroduction of a more intuitive method for swimming, one that had been in evidence in ancient cultures such as Ancient Assyria, his method revolutionized the state of competitive swimming – his stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today. In his stroke, the arms were brought forward, alternating, while the body rolled from side to side. The kick was a scissors kick such as that familiarly used in breaststroke, with one kick for two arm strokes, although it is believed that the Native Americans had indeed used a flutter kick. Front crawl variants used different ratios of scissor kicks to arm strokes, or alternated with a flutter (up-and-down) kick. The speed of the new stroke was demonstrated by F.V.C. Lane in 1901, swimming in 1:00.0, an improvement of about ten seconds compared to the breaststroke record. Due to its speed the Trudgen became very quickly popular around the world, despite all the ungentleman-like splashing.\nCaptain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. He used breaststroke, swimming in 21 hours and 45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until Bill Burgess made the crossing in 1911. Other European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896. The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892.\nNancy Edberg popularized women's swimming in Stockholm from 1847. She made swimming lessons accessible for both sexes and later introduced swimming lessons for women in Denmark and Norway. Her public swimming exhibitions from 1856 with her students were likely among the first public exhibitions of women swimming in Europe\nIn 1897, Capt. Henry Sheffield designed a rescue can or rescue cylinder, now well known as the lifesaving device. The pointed ends made it slide faster through the water, although it can cause injuries.\nOlympic era.\nThe Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens, a male-only competition. Six events were planned for the swimming competition, but only four events were actually contested: 100 m, 500 m, and 1200 m freestyle and 100 m for sailors. The first gold medal was won by Alfréd Hajós of Hungary in the 100 m freestyle. Hajós was also victorious in the 1200 m event, and was unable to compete in the 500 m, which was won by Austrian Paul Neumann.\nThe second Olympic games in Paris in 1900 featured 200 m, 1000 m, and 4000 m freestyle, 200 m backstroke, and a 200 m team race (see also Swimming at the 1900 Summer Olympics). There were two additional unusual swimming events (although common at the time): an obstacle swimming course in the Seine river (swimming with the current), and an underwater swimming race. The 4000 m freestyle was won by John Arthur Jarvis in under one hour, the longest Olympic swimming race until the 10k marathon swim was introduced in 2008. The backstroke was also introduced to the Olympic Games in Paris, as was water polo. The \"Osborne Swimming Club\" from Manchester beat club teams from Belgium, France and Germany quite easily.\nThe Trudgen stroke was improved by Australian-born Richmond Cavill. Cavill, whose father Frederick Cavill narrowly failed to swim the English Channel, is credited with developing the stroke after observing a young boy from the Solomon Islands. Cavill and his brothers spread the Australian crawl to England, New Zealand and America. Richmond used this stroke in 1902 at an International Championships in England to set a new world record by out swimming all Trudgen swimmers over the in 0:58.4\nThe Olympics in 1904 in St. Louis included races over , 100 yards, , 440 yards, and one mile (1.6 km) freestyle, backstroke and breaststroke, and the 4x50 yards freestyle relay (see also Swimming at the 1904 Summer Olympics). These games differentiated between breaststroke and freestyle, so that there were now two defined styles (breaststroke and backstroke) and freestyle, where most people swam Trudgen. These games also featured a competition to plunge for distance, where the distance without swimming, after jumping in a pool, was measured.\nIn 1908, the world swimming association Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA) was formed.\nWomen were first allowed to swim in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, competing in freestyle races. In the 1912 games, Harry Hebner of the United States won the 100 m backstroke. At these games Duke Kahanamoku from Hawaii won the 100 m freestyle, having learned the six kicks per cycle front crawl from older natives of his island. This style is now considered the classical front crawl style. The men's competitions were 100 m, 400 m, and 1500 m freestyle, 100 m backstroke, 200 m and 400 m breaststroke, and four by 200 m freestyle relay. The women's competitions were 100 m freestyle and four by 100 m freestyle relay.\nThe \"Deutsche Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft (DLRG)\" (German lifesaving organization) was established on October 19, 1913 in Leipzig after 17 people drowned while trying to board the cruise steamer \"Kronprinz Wilhelm\". In the same year the first elastic swimsuit was made by the sweater company \"Jantzen\".\nIn 1922, Johnny Weissmuller became the first person to swim the 100 m in less than a minute, using a six kicks per cycle Australian crawl. Johnny Weissmuller started the golden age of swimming, winning five Olympic medals and 36 national championships and never losing a race in his ten-year career, until he retired from swimming and started his second career starring as Tarzan in film. His record of 51 seconds in freestyle stood for over 17 years. In the same year, Sybil Bauer was the first woman to break a men's world record over the 440 m backstroke in 6:24.8.\nAt the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, lane dividers made of cork were used for the first time, and lines on the pool bottom aided with orientation.\nSwimming innovation.\nThe scientific study of swimming began in 1928 with David Armbruster, a coach at the University of Iowa, who filmed swimmers underwater. The Japanese also used underwater photography to research the stroke mechanics, and subsequently dominated the 1932 Summer Olympics. Armbruster also researched a problem of breaststroke where the swimmer was slowed down significantly while bringing the arms forward underwater. In 1934 Armbruster refined a method to bring the arms forward over water in breaststroke. While this \"butterfly\" technique was difficult, it brought a great improvement in speed. One year later, in 1935, Jack Sieg, a swimmer also from the University of Iowa developed a technique involving swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison similar to a fish tail, and modified the technique afterward to swim it face down. Armbruster and Sieg combined these techniques into a variant of the breaststroke called butterfly with the two kicks per cycle being called dolphin fishtail kick. Using this technique Sieg swam in 1:00.2. However, even though this technique was much faster than regular breaststroke, the dolphin fishtail kick violated the rules and was not allowed. Therefore, the butterfly arms with a breaststroke kick were used by a few swimmers in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin for the breaststroke competitions. In 1938, almost every breaststroke swimmer was using this butterfly style, yet this stroke was considered a variant of the breaststroke until 1952, when it was accepted as a separate style with a set of rules.\nAround that time another modification to the backstroke became popular. Previously, the arms were held straight during the underwater push phase, for example by the top backstroke swimmer from 1935 to 1945, Adolph Kiefer. However, Australian swimmers developed a technique where the arms are bent underwater, increasing the horizontal push and the resulting speed and reducing the wasted force upward and sideways. This style is now generally used worldwide.\nIn 1935 topless swimsuits for men were worn for the first time during an official competition. In 1943, the US ordered the reduction of fabric in swimsuits by 10% due to wartime shortages, resulting in the first two piece swimsuits. Shortly afterwards the bikini was invented in Paris by Louis Reard (officially) or Jacques Heim (earlier, but slightly larger).\nAnother modification was developed for breaststroke. In breaststroke, breaking the water surface increases the friction, reducing the speed of the swimmer. Therefore, swimming underwater increases the speed. This led to a controversy at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and six swimmers were disqualified as they repeatedly swam long distances underwater between surfacing to breathe. The rule was changed to require breaststroke to be swum at the surface starting with the first surfacing after the start and after each turn. However, one Japanese swimmer, Masaru Furukawa, circumvented the rule by not surfacing at all after the start, but swimming as much of the lane underwater as possible before breaking the surface. He swam all but 5 meters underwater for the first three 50 meter laps, and also swam half of the last lap underwater, winning the gold medal. The adoption of this technique led to many swimmers suffering from oxygen starvation or even some swimmers passing out during the race due to a lack of air, and a new breaststroke rule was introduced by FINA, additionally limiting the distance that can be swum underwater after the start and every turn, and requiring the head to break the surface every cycle. The 1956 Games in Melbourne also saw the introduction of the flip turn, a sort of tumble turn to faster change directions at the end of the lane.\nIn 1972, another famous swimmer, Mark Spitz, was at the height of his career. During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he won seven gold medals. Shortly thereafter in 1973, the first swimming world championship was held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia by the FINA.\nBreaking the water surface reduces the speed in swimming. The swimmers Daichi Suzuki (Japan) and David Berkoff (America) used this for the 100 meter backstroke at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Berkoff swam 33 meters of the first lane completely underwater using only a dolphin kick, far ahead of his competition. A sports commentator called this a \"Berkoff Blastoff\". Suzuki, having practiced the underwater technique for 10 years, surfaced only a little bit earlier, winning the race in 55.05. At that time, this was not restricted by FINA backstroke rules. The backstroke rules were quickly changed in the same year by the FINA to ensure the health and safety of the swimmers, limiting the underwater phase after the start to ten meters, which was expanded to 15 meters in 1991. In Seoul, Kristin Otto from East Germany won six gold medals, the most ever won by a woman.\nAnother innovation is the use of flip turns for backstroke. According to the rules, a backstroke swimmer had to touch the wall while lying less than 90 degrees out of the horizontal. Some swimmers discovered that they could turn faster if they rolled almost 90 degrees sideways, touched the wall, and made a forward tumble turn, pushing off the wall on their backs. The FINA has changed the rules to allow the swimmers to turn over completely before touching the wall to simplify this turn and to improve the speed of the races.\nSimilarly, the dolphin-kick underwater swimming technique is now also used for butterfly. Consequently, in 1998 FINA introduced a rule limiting swimmers to 15 meters underwater per lap before they must surface. After underwater swimming for freestyle and backstroke, the underwater swimming technique is now also used for butterfly, for example by Denis Pankratov (Russia) or Angela Kennedy (Australia), swimming large distances underwater with a dolphin kick. FINA is again considering a rule change for safety reasons. It is faster to do butterfly kick underwater for the first few meters off the wall than swimming at the surface. In 2005, FINA declared that you may take 1 underwater dolphin kick in the motion of a breaststroke pull-out.\nSophisticated bodyskins were banned from FINA competitions from the start of 2010 after many national swimming federations demanded the action, and leading athletes such as Michael Phelps and Rebecca Adlington criticized the suits."

        "text": "Rugby Club CERN - Meyrin - St Genis (RC CMSG) are a semi-professional Swiss rugby union club situated on the French–Swiss border, northwest of Geneva. The club plays in the Swiss first division where it is one of the most successful teams in the country's history, behind Hermance RRC.\nClub history.\nRC CMSG was formed as \"Rugby Club du CERN\" (Rugby Club of CERN) in 1965, making it the oldest club currently playing in Switzerland. The earliest recorded match in Switzerland was in 1869 and if they were still in existence, Lausanne RFC could have claimed to be as old as Blackheath. The club was originally formed by staff of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in around 1960, playing against other companies and organizations in the Geneva area. In 1970, RC CERN organised a memorial competition, \"Challenge Laurent Membrez\", in honor of Laurent Membrez, the founder of Albaladejo Rugby Club. This led to the creation of the Swiss Rugby Federation in 1972 with the then president of RC CERN, André Cordaillat, becoming the federation's first president. In 1984, the club moved to its present ground just across the border in Saint-Genis-Pouilly, France; despite being officially renamed to \"Rugby Club CERN - St Genis\", it was still referred to as RC CERN. Then in 2003 the club merged with the successful \"Ecole de rugby Meyrin\" (Meyrin Rugby School), creating the present Rugby Club CERN - Meyrin - St Genis with two stadiums, one in France and one in Switzerland. In 2005, the Wildcats, RC CMSG's women's rugby team, were created, adding to the growth of women's rugby in Switzerland.\nAfter the creation of the Swiss Federation, the club enjoyed considerable success, winning both the Swiss Championship and Swiss Cup repeatedly. In the early 1990s, the fortunes of the club started to change and their successes became less frequent, with the club eventually being relegated to the second division in 1994. The club regained promotion a couple of years later but were only to remain in the first division for a further two years. After a dispute between players, coaches and management, the president removed the club from all competitions. In the autumn of 2000, a new management took control of the club, bringing in ex-England B, Ireland A, Northampton and Gloucester second row, John Etheridge, as coach. The club then won the third and second divisions in consecutive years, but were unable to stay in the first division, and after the second relegation from the first division, Etheridge left the club. In 2007, RC CMSG appointed Claude Ezoua as head coach, who notably took the Ivory Coast rugby team to the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The club then achieved promotion back to the first division in the 2008–2009 season, losing only one game in the whole season, with the club managing to stay in the first division during the 2009–2010 season for the first time in 15 years. RC CMSG slowly climbed to the top of table, each season finishing higher than the previous, and making the league knock-out stages for three consecutive seasons. In 2014 CERN re-enforced the coaching setup with the ex-Romanian national squad captain Ioan Doja who represented his country at the World Cup, also playing teams such as for Oyonnax.\nThe January 2015 General Assembly voted in new club president Grégory Bertrand, long time member of the club. Due to a number of players leaving the club, the management asked the Swiss Federation for the club to be relegated to the second division for the 2015/2016 season after 6 years in the first division. The 2015/2016 season saw CERN undefeated at home and following the league play off matches they were promoted back to the first division after only one season in the second division."

        "title": "Michael Watson (lacrosse)",
        "text": "Michael Watson (born October 24, 1974) is an American lacrosse player who starred in college at the University of Virginia before moving on to play professional lacrosse in Major League Lacrosse.\nHigh school and collegiate career.\nMichael Watson attended prep school at St. Paul's School in Brooklandville, Maryland, where he was a high school All-American. He played NCAA Division I lacrosse at the University of Virginia from 1994 and 1997. As a prolific attackman, Watson garnered numerous awards and helped lead the Virginia Cavaliers to two NCAA national championship appearances, one in 1994 and one in 1996. In both title games, however, Princeton defeated Virginia by one goal in overtime. Watson was a four-time All-American attackman, having been named to the Third Team in 1994, Second Team in 1995, and First Team in 1996 and 1997. In addition, he was named by the USILA as Attackman of the Year for Division I in 1996 (Lt. Col. Jack Turnbull Award). Watson was also named All-ACC four times, picked as the Most Valuable Player of the 1996 NCAA Tournament, named the 1994 ACC Rookie of the Year, was selected to play in 1997 North-South Senior All-Star Game, and was named one of the 50 greatest lacrosse players in ACC history in 2002. Watson ranks second for most career goals at Virginia with 142 goals in 62 games, behind teammate Doug Knight's 165 goals in 60 games. The Virginia attack unit consisting of Watson, Doug Knight, and Tim Whiteley is regarded as among the best of all time, leading the nation in offensive output and setting several ACC records. Watson was also selected for the 1998 U.S. National Team and scored 12 goals and 8 assists for 20 total points in the 1998 World Lacrosse Championship held in Baltimore, Maryland.\nWatson and Virginia teammate Doug Knight are credited with popularizing \"the dive\" or \"the dive shot,\" an acrobatic move where an offensive player attacks the goal from behind the net by diving airborne through the goal crease while shooting the ball at the goal while in mid-air. The NCAA subsequently banned this practice in 1998 due to safety concerns and difficulty in officiating the play.\nProfessional career.\nWatson played professional outdoor lacrosse for the Major League Lacrosse team the Boston Cannons from 2001 to 2004. In 2002, he played in all 14 regular season games and led the team in assists and picked up 28 groundballs. In 2003, he scored 31 points and was selected to the MLL All-Star Team. In 2004, Watson scored 39 goals with eight assists for 47 total points, including a six-goal game against the Rochester Rattlers. He scored 20 goals in four games, which is the best four-game stretch in MLL history. The Cannons selected Watson as Offensive Player of the Year. In addition, \"Inside Lacrosse\" magazine named him \"The MLL's Most Electrifying Player\" in 2004.\nFollowing a year off from the sport, Watson returned to the MLL in 2006 as the first overall draft pick by the Los Angeles Riptide. He played in 12 games and notched 40 points and one game-winning goal. In 2007, he appeared in all 12 Riptide games and led the team in goals with 31, and was second on the team in points with 40. He scored two game-winning goals and picked up 24 groundballs. He also scored five goals in a game three times and was named to the 2007 MLL Western Conference All-Star team. In 2008, Watson scored 10 goals and 11 assists and scooped up 15 groundballs. The Los Angeles Riptide ceased operations before the 2009 season due to the economic downturn in the United States.\nWatson is the model for the Major League Lacrosse logo.\nWatson was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2013."

        "title": "Alexander Todd (rugby union)",
        "text": "Alexander Findlater Todd (20 September 1873 – 21 April 1915) was an English rugby union forward who played for Cambridge University and Blackheath F.C. at club level, and Kent at county level. Todd played international rugby for England and later represented the British Isles team on their 1896 tour of South Africa.\nTodd was an all-round sportsman, captaining his school team in association football and playing cricket for Berkshire in 23 Minor Counties Cricket Championship matches between 1910 and 1913. The Wisden obituaries of 1915 refer to Todd as a '...capital wicket keeper'.\nPersonal history.\nTodd was born in Lewisham in 1873 to Bruce Beveridge Todd, a wine merchant from Forest Hill, and Phoebe Brooker. He was educated at Mill Hill School before matriculating to Caius College in 1892. While at Cambridge he was initiated into Isaac Newton University Lodge. He received his BA in 1892 and after leaving university he joined the British Army, and saw action in the Second Boer War with both Roberts' Horse and Carrington's Horse. He rose to the rank of squadron leader during the campaign and was wounded in action. After the war had ended, he transferred to a militia regiment and was appointed captain in the 4th Battalion the Norfolk Regiment on 6 September 1902.\nOn his return to Britain he set up in business in London, and on 2 December 1902 he married Alice Mary Crean, sister of Thomas Crean with whom Todd toured South Africa in 1896.\nIn 1914 he joined the special Reserve Battalion of the Norfolk Regiment and reached the rank of captain whilst serving in France during the First World War. In 1915, Todd was part of the British assault on Hill 60 at Ypres Salient. He was seriously wounded during the action and died of his injuries on 21 April. His remains are buried at Poperinge Old Military Cemetery. \nMistakenly, Captain Todd is also remembered and named on the Menin Gate which is where soldiers without a known grave are commemorated.\nRugby career.\nTodd was a keen sportsman from a young age, and while at school at Mill Hill he captained both the football and rugby team. On entering Cambridge, he continued his passion for sport and was selected for the Cambridge University team. He played in three University Varsity Matches, collecting his sporting 'Blues' between 1893 and 1895. On leaving University he joined Blackheath, and would later becoming a leading member of the Kent county team, and was invited to join the touring Barbarian team in 1894.\nTodd spent the major portion of his rugby career with first-class English team, Blackheath F.C., and was representing the club when he was approached by team-mate Johnny Hammond to join the 1896 British Isles tour of South Africa. Todd was one of four Blackheath players on the tour, along with Hammond, Matthew Mullineux and Froude Hancock. Todd played in all four Tests against the South African national team, which ended in three wins for the tourists, and a loss in the final game played at Cape Town. In the Second Test, which the British team won by the largest margin, all three tries came from forward positions, one of them was scored by Todd; his first and only international points.\nOn his return to Britain, Todd rejoined Blackheath, and was still a club member when four years later he was capped by his country as part of the 1900 Home Nations Championship. In the opening match of the tournament against Wales, the English selectors had gambled on 13 new caps, and lost the game. In the second game of the series, played against Ireland at the Athletic Ground in Richmond, Todd was given his chance, and he was brought into a more stable side than the previous match. England won 15–4. Todd was then reselected for the final game of the Championship, an away encounter with Scotland. The game was extremely tight, with the English halves reluctant to bring the backs into play, and the game ended in a 0–0 draw. As Scotland were the holders of the Calcutta Cup, the draw meant they retained the trophy, and England finished second in the Championship behind Wales. Todd was not reselected the next season and never represented his country in rugby again."

        "title": "NZ Cycling Conference",
        "text": "The NZ Cycling Conference is a series of cycle planning conferences started in 1997 in Hamilton. Since 2001, the conference series has a biennial schedule. The conferences are one of the key ways of exchanging expertise about planning and design for cycling in New Zealand. Starting in 2012, the scope of the conference includes both walking and cycling, by combining the previous Living Streets Aotearoa biennial NZ Walking Conference series, and was rebranded \"2WALKandCYCLE\". The most recent conference was held in Palmerston North in July–August 2018.\nConference organisation.\nInitially, conference attendees and speakers were mainly cycle advocates, but the conferences have developed a broader appeal across all sectors that are involved in policy, promotion and provision for cyclists – such as from representatives from the NZ Transport Agency or local authorities.\nThe conferences are organised by an organising committee made up of representatives of various organisations. In 2009, for example, these included Cycling Advocates' Network, NZ Transport Agency, Ministry of Health and New Plymouth District Council.\nWhen plans were made for what would have been the 2011 conference, it was considered whether it would be useful to have a combined event covering both walking and cycling. This was agreed to by Living Streets Aotearoa, the organiser of the NZ Walking Conference. The first combined walking and cycling conference, branded as \"2WALKandCYCLE\", was held from 22 to 24 February 2012 in Hastings. The conference was organised by representatives of Cycling Advocates' Network, Hastings District Council staff, Living Streets Aotearoa, New Zealand Transport Agency, and some individuals.\nConferences.\nConferences have been or will be held in the following locations:\n1997 Hamilton.\nThe 1st conference was held on 15 October 1997.

The conference theme was \"Transport for Living\". The keynote speaker was Karel de Roy, a traffic engineer and transport planner from the Netherlands.\nThe conference came about as three people from Christchurch City Council had attended the 1999 VelOZity conference in Adelaide: Alix Newman (the city's Cycle Planning Officer), Axel Wilke (a design engineer with an interest in cycling), and Denis O'Rourke (a city councillor with an interest in transport). O'Rourke was impressed by the professional knowledge sharing that such a conference can provide and announced at the 2000 NZ Cycling Conference that Christchurch would host the conference in 2001, putting Newman in charge of organising it.\n2003 North Shore.\nThe 4th conference was held on 10–11 October 2003. The conference theme was \"Cycling Strategies – And How to Implement Them\". Steven Norris, the Chair of the UK National Cycling Strategy Board was the keynote speaker.

Gottwald retired originally after the 2006-07 World Cup season, but came out of retirement in May 2009 to compete for the 2009-10 World Cup season including the 2010 Games. Bill Demong of the United States was the defending world champion in this event.\nTwo test events took place at the Olympic venue on 16–17 January 2009 with Demong winning on the 16th and Norway's Magnus Moan, defending Olympic silver medalist in this event when it was the 7.5 km sprint, winning on the 17th. The last World Cup event prior to the 2010 Games in this format took place on 10 January 2010 in Val di Fiemme, Italy and was won by Demong.\nResults.\nSki Jumping.\nThe ski jumping took place with a trial round at 09:00 PST and the competition round at 10:00 PST. One jump in competition was scored similar to that of ski jumping. With 28 skiers having competed their jumps, officials abandoned the competition to high winds. They were restarted at 11:00 PST (19:00 GMT). Jumping resumed despite complaints from co-test event winner Moan, defending Olympic champion Gottwald, and Lamy-Chappuis, the current World Cup leader and winner of the 10 km individual normal hill gold medal on the 14th. Moan described the jumps as a \"joke\" while a French coach called the FIS's decision as a \"scandal\". Despite the complaints, Gottwald's teammate Gruber had the longest jump with 134.0 m.\nCross-Country.\nThe start for the 10 kilometre race was staggered, with a one-point deficit in the ski jump portion resulting in a four-second deficit in starting the cross-country course. This stagger meant that the first athlete across the finish line would be the overall winner of the event. Cross-country skiing's part of the competition was scheduled to take place at 13:00 PST that same day, but was moved to 14:00 PST in the wake of the high winds during the ski jumping part of the competition.\nFinland's Koivuranta, who finished 44th in the ski jumping part of this event, did not start in the cross-county portion of this event. Defending Olympic champion Gottwald had the fastest cross-country skiing part of the event to move from 40th to 17th. Meanwhile, Spillane and defending World champion Demong caught ski jumping leader Gruber at the 4.0 km mark though all three skiers stayed together until 600 m was left in the event before Demong and Spillane pulled away to finish one-two in the event. Spillane won his third Olympic silver medal in this Olympics while Demong's gold followed his silver earned in the team event two days earlier. In the post-race press conference, Demong stated that Spillane's silver in the 10 km individual normal hill event was \"a dream come true\" on 14 February, the silver in the team event was \"icing on the cake\", and that his gold was \"something extra\". Spillane stated that if there was one person who he wanted to beat him, \"...it would have been Bill\". Bronze medalist Gruber commented that Demong and Spillane \"...were just too strong\". It marked the first time an American won a gold medal in Nordic skiing (cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, ski jumping) in the Winter Olympics.\nAfter the medal ceremony held later that evening, Demong proposed to his girlfriend, Katie Koczynski, in front of teammates and coaches at the team headquarters near Vancouver. Koczynski said yes. Also on that same day, Demong found out he was named the flagbearer for the American team at the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics on 28 February. It was Demong's teammate, Spillane, who gave Demong the courage to propose to his now fiancée. Demong and his fiancée discussed how this happened on NBC's \"Today\" show the following morning."

The Finn would finish 26th. A group of eight skiers developed during the middle part of the race which had Bill Demong move from 24th to the final lead group by the 7.5 km mark. Japan's Norihito Kobayashi grabbed the lead with 800 m left only to be passed by Johnny Spillane of the US, France's Jason Lamy-Chappuis, Italy's Alessandro Pittin, and Spillane's teammate Lodwick. Lamy-Chappuis passed Spillane right before the final sprint though Spillane mounted a final charge that fell 0.4 seconds short. Norway's Magnus Moan had the fastest time in the cross-country skiing portion of the event to move from 40th to ninth. It was the first individual medal for all three competitors, along with being the first medals for both the US and Italy in Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics. Italy's best finish prior to this event in Nordic combined was fifth by Ezio Damolin at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble."

The last World Cup event prior to the 2010 Games in this format took place on 12 December 2009 in Harrachov, Czech Republic, but that event was cancelled on 4 December 2009 to warm weather and lack of snow. A team normal hill event took place prior to the 2010 Winter Games in Schonach, Germany on 24 January 2010 and was won by the German team of Georg Hettich, Eric Frenzel, Björn Kircheisen, and Tino Edelmann.\nResults.\nSki Jumping.\nEach of the four team members performed a single jump that was judged in the same format as the Olympic ski jumping competition. The scores for all the jumps each team were combined and used to calculate their deficit in the cross-country skiing portion of the event. Each point difference between teams in the ski jumping portion in this event resulted in a 1.33 second difference in the cross country part of the event (i.e. one minute cross country from 45 points in ski jumping). At the previous Olympics in Turin, the point-time differential was one point equaling one second. The ski jumping portion took place with a trial round at 10:30 PST and the competition round at 11:30 PST. Finland's Ryynänen had the longest jump in the ski jumping part of the competition with 138.5 m, which helped the Finns have a two-second advantage over the Americans at the cross-country portion of the event.\nCross-Country.\nThe start for the 4 x 5 kilometre relay race was staggered, with a one-point deficit in the ski jump portion resulting in a 1.33 second deficit in starting the cross-country course.

Top three teams at the start of the cross-country portion of the event were Finland (who would finish seventh), the United States, and Austria. Eventual fifth-place finisher Norway's Schmid had the fastest first leg to propel his team from seventh to sixth, with the top three teams at the first exchange being the United States, Finland, and Austria. David Kreiner of Austria had both the fastest second leg and fastest cross-country leg overall to move his team from third to second, with the top three teams at the second exchange being the United States, Austria, and France (who would finish fourth). Kreiner's teammate, Felix Gottwald, had the fastest leg in the third leg to move past American Johnny Spillane for the lead, with German Eric Frenzel moving his team past France's Sebastien Lacroix for third place at the third exchange. Bill Demong of the United States closed the 14.1 second gap to Austria's Mario Stecher down to a lead heading into the final descent before slipping. Stecher moved ahead to win Austria its second straight gold medal in this event, with Bernhard Gruber replacing Michael Gruber, and Kreiner replacing Bieler. Defending World champion Japan, with Takahashi replacing Minato, finished a disappointing sixth. Germany won the bronze, with Rydzek replacing Hettich. It was the first Olympic medals for Gruber, Kreiner, Camerota, Lodwick, Demong, Rydzek, Edelmann, and Frenzel. The 5.2 second margin of victory was the closest at the Winter Olympics in this event since West Germany's 3.4 second win over Switzerland at Calgary in 1988."

Originally the tournament was scheduled to be held in the Netherlands but on 4 June 2012 the Dutch Handball Federation withdrew from the organization. Subsequently, the European Handball Federation (EHF) launched a new bidding process and eventually selected Serbia as the new host on 18 June 2012.\nMontenegro captured their first title by defeating defending champion Norway 34–31 in the final.\nHost selection.\nInitially on its meeting on 27 September 2008 the EHF awarded the championship to the Netherlands, defeating Ukraine in the second round of voting while Germany and Serbia withdrew their candidacy during the congress. This could have been the second time for Netherlands to host the tournament, however, on 4 June 2012 the Dutch Handball Federation announced they are unable to organize the European Championship. A day later the EHF re-launched the host selection process; ten nations had shown interest in organizing the competition, including Croatia, Denmark, Iceland, Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia and Sweden. Romania added their interest the day after. On 18 June 2012 the EHF granted the organizational rights to Serbia and also disposed of the fate of the Dutch national team. Since Serbia, the new host already qualified for the European Championship, the place reserved for the host nation was passed to Iceland as the best non-qualified team and the Netherlands were pulled out from the tournament.\nVenues.\nFive venues in four cities had been selected to host the matches:\nQualification.\nQualification matches were played from September 2011 to June 2012.

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1948 Olympic Games took place between 30 and 31 July at the Empire Pool. There were 41 competitors from 19 nations. Nations had been limited to three swimmers each since the 1924 Games. The event was won by Wally Ris, returning the United States to the podium in the event after a one-Games absence broke a seven-Games streak. It was the sixth victory for an American in the 100 metre freestyle, most of any nation. Another American, Alan Ford, took silver. Géza Kádas of Hungary earned bronze, the nation's third medal in four Games. Japan's three-Games medal streak in the event ended with no Japanese swimmers competing due to the nation not being invited after World War II.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nNone of the seven finalists from the pre-World War II 1936 Games returned. Alex Jany, a teenager from France, was the favorite in the event. The American team, including world record holder Alan Ford, was also strong. Ford had beaten Jany's record a month before the Games.\nCuba, Iceland, India, and Mexico each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 10th appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (quarterfinals, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule was a modification of the one used since 1912, allowing the top swimmers in each race plus one or more wild cards to advance. For this event, the top two in each preliminary heat plus the next four fastest swimmers would advance to the semifinals; the top three in each semifinal plus the next two fastest swimmers would move on to the final. There were 6 heats of between 6 and 8 swimmers, allowing 16 swimmers to advance to the semifinals. The 2 semifinals had 8 swimmers each; 8 advanced to the final.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of two lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1948 Summer Olympics.\nWally Ris equaled the Olympic record in the second semifinal with 57.5 seconds, then beat it with 57.3 seconds in the final.\nResults.\nFinal.\nJany led at halfway but fell back into the pack after the turn. Ford led until the 80 metre point, when Ris passed him. Kádas, in a tight race with Ford for second place, crashed into the lane divider just before the end of the race."

In addition, six Big East players who were on the preseason list did not appear at midseason: Devin Ebanks, Corey Fisher, Jeremy Hazell, Samardo Samuels, Deonta Vaughn, and Kemba Walker. The list was reduced to a final national ballot of about 20 players in March.

He played for one season, in 1921, for the Evansville Crimson Giants of the National Football League. Prior to playing pro football, Henderson played at the college level at Ohio State. There he was a starting halfback on the Buckeyes 1920 Big Ten Championship team. He also participated in the 1921 Rose Bowl Game. He later served as a football coach at Central High School in Evansville, Indiana for 4 years with a record of 26-8-2. After his coaching career ended, Henderson became an Athletic Business Manager. He stayed in that position for 5 years. He then made his mark as a Football Official in Indiana and was a grader of the Big Ten Conference officials for several years. He was the 86th person inducted into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame on November 30, 1979.\nEvansville Crimson Giants.\nIn 1921, the Crimson Giants' first year as a professional squad, Henderson led the team in total scoring by accounting for 29 of their 89 points on the season. Starting in four games that year as both a wingback and placekicker, Henderson accumulated four rushing touchdowns and five extra-point conversions. All four of his touchdowns came in the team's final game of the season, playing host to the Cincinnati Celts. According to ESPN Statistics and Information, Henderson was for 93 years the only NFL player to enter a game with no career touchdowns and finish that game with four or more. This feat stood independently until 2014, when it was matched by New England Patriots running back Jonas Gray in a matchup against the Indianapolis Colts.\nDuring a 1921 game against the Hammond Pros, Henderson stated that the Hammond players met with him during the game and asked if he could tone down his hits because the Hammond players still needed to be healthy for work on Monday. Henderson, a high school football coach, refused and stated that he needed to show his players, who were sitting in the stands watching him, \"how tackling was done\"."

        "text": "Wimbledon Football Club was an English football club from Wimbledon, south-west London, amateur from 1889 to 1964 and professional thereafter. Founded in 1889 as Wimbledon Old Central Football Club, an amateur club playing in local league competitions, the club shortened its name to \"Wimbledon\" in 1905, entered the FA Amateur Cup for the first time in 1905–06 and joined the Spartan League in 1909. After going out of business a year later, Wimbledon immediately reformed and returned to local leagues in 1912, where the team stayed until the 1919–20 season when the club joined the Athenian League. Moving to the Isthmian League in 1921, Wimbledon won four league championships in six years during the 1930s and reached the FA Amateur Cup Final in 1935 before losing to Bishop Auckland after a replay. The club continued to be successful following the Second World War, again reaching the Amateur Cup Final in 1947 and finishing as runners-up in the Isthmian League in 1950 and 1952. After claiming a fourth Isthmian League crown in 1959, Wimbledon then took three successive championships from 1962 to 1964, as well as the 1963 FA Amateur Cup.\nThese achievements prompted the switch to professional football, which occurred in 1964, concurrently with the extension of membership from the Southern Football League. Wimbledon finished second twice out of the team's first four outings in this competition, before again winning three consecutive titles from 1975 to 1977. The club won election to The Football League after these successes, and thus entered the Fourth Division for the first time in 1977–78. Wimbledon took only ten seasons as a Football League club to reach England's top flight, winning promotion to the First Division for the 1986–87 season; Wimbledon then beat League champions Liverpool 1–0 in the 1988 FA Cup Final to achieve the feat of having won both the FA Cup and its amateur equivalent (as of 2009, only two other clubs – Old Carthusians and Royal Engineers AFC – had done this). Wimbledon remained in the top division until 2000, when the side was relegated. The club announced an unpopular relocation to Milton Keynes in 2001, which received permission a year later, causing the foundation of AFC Wimbledon by the majority of Wimbledon fans, who called it \"the death of [their] club\". The club subsequently relocated to Milton Keynes in September 2003, and rebranded itself as Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.\nKey.\nTop scorer and number of goals scored shown in bold when he was also top scorer for the division\nDivision shown in bold when it changes due to promotion, relegation or reorganisation\nLeague results shown \"in italics\" for abandoned or wartime competitions"

The court found in their favour and ordered the ARL to consider all players for selection regardless of who they were aligned to.

        "text": "Ralph Allon \"Catfish\" Smith Sr. (December 1, 1938 – August 23, 2023) was an American professional football player who was an end in the National Football League (NFL). He played eight seasons, for the Philadelphia Eagles (1962–1964), Cleveland Browns (1965–1968), and the Atlanta Falcons (1969). He was drafted out of Ole Miss by the Eagles in 1962 and also had a stint with the New Orleans Saints.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born on December 1, 1938, in Brookhaven, Mississippi, and grew up there. He first attended the University Military School in Mobile, Alabama, in 1954, before transferring to Brookhaven High School in his hometown, where he would attend from 1955 to 1957. A teammate of Lance Alworth on the football team, he earned 15 letters across four sports (football, basketball, track, baseball).\nSmith had many accomplishments at Brookhaven. In football, he helped them win the conference championship in 1955 and 1957, earning all-conference, All-Southern and All-American honors in all three seasons while being invited to several all-star games as a senior. He also was three times named all-conference in basketball, helped them win the conference basketball championship in 1955, and helped the track team win the state championship in 1957.\nCollege career.\nSmith began attending the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) in 1958 and played on the freshman football team that year. He made the varsity team in 1959 and went on to play through 1961 as a two-way end. He contributed to their back-to-back national championships in 1959 and 1960 and overall the team went with him on the roster. Ole Miss made a bowl game every year Smith was on the roster and he earned All-SEC honors in his final two years, being a third-team selection in 1960 and a second-team choice in 1961. As a senior in 1961, he led the team in both receiving and tackles for loss while being named second-team All-American.\nSmith received the nickname \"Catfish\" at Ole Miss, being likened to Vernon \"Catfish\" Smith who played at Georgia.\nProfessional career.\nSmith was selected in both the 1962 AFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers (12th round, 93rd overall) and the 1962 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles (8th round, 111th overall), ultimately choosing to play for the Eagles. He appeared in 13 games, none as a starter, in his rookie season, recording one reception for 29 yards along with one rush for 13 yards. He played all 14 games, four as a starter, in 1963 before playing 11 games, two as a starter, for the team in 1964. He caught five passes for 63 yards and a touchdown in 1963 and then had four for 35 yards the following season. He was released by the team as part of roster cuts in 1965.\nSmith joined the Cleveland Browns after being released by Philadelphia. He went on to play four years for the Browns, appearing in every game during that span while starting 29 of his 56 appearances. He caught 13 passes for 183 yards with three touchdowns in 1966 and had a career-best 14 catches for 211 yards the following year, scoring two touchdowns in that season (one receiving, one on a fumble return). He was released following the 1968 season.\nAfter leaving the Browns, Smith signed with the New Orleans Saints. He did not make the final roster. He was signed off waivers by the Atlanta Falcons after failing to make the Saints. Smith played in all 14 games as a backup for Atlanta before retiring after the season. He finished his NFL career having played 108 games, 25 of which he started, and recorded six touchdowns (five receiving, one fumble return) with 41 receptions for 549 yards.\nLater life and death.\nSmith started and operated a barbecue restaurant called \"Skinny's\" after his football career. He was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. He died on August 23, 2023, in McComb, Mississippi, at age 84."

Usually, the Rose Bowl was played on January 1, but in 1928, that fell on a Sunday, so the game was played on January 2, 1928. At this time, the Rose Bowl was the top and only bowl game, an east-vs.-west matchup. Stanford won the game, 7–6.\nCoaching.\nThe coach for Pittsburgh was Jock Sutherland, while the Stanford coach was Pop Warner. Sutherland had played on several of Warner's Pitt teams while Warner was head coach at Pitt. Warner was head coach at Pitt from 1915 to 1923 and coached the Panthers to three undefeated seasons, 33 straight wins, and was credited with three national championships for Pitt before going to Stanford in 1924.\nGame summary.\nStanford's Frank Wilton had been the goat of the 1927 Rose Bowl: with Stanford leading 7–0 late in the game, an Alabama defender broke through the line and blocked his punt, setting up the Tide's tying touchdown. In the 1928 game, Wilton again made a critical error, losing the ball after being hit on his own 20 yard line, allowing Pittsburgh's Jimmy Hagan to run the fumble in for a touchdown. Walt Heinecke of Stanford blocked Allen Booth's point after attempt, holding Pitt's lead to 6–0. Later in the game, Wilton had his redemption when teammate Spud Lewis fumbled a yard from the goal. Wilton scooped up the ball and crashed through for the tying touchdown. The kick was good, and Stanford held on for a 7–6 win.\nGame notes.\nThe capacity of the Pasadena Rose Bowl Stadium was increased to 76,000, adding 19,000 seats. At game time, the temperature was ."

        "text": "The 2009–10 Ivy League men's basketball season was the 56th season of Ivy League basketball. The Cornell University Big Red won their third consecutive Ivy League Championship and were the league's representative at the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Seeded 12th in the East Region the Big Red won their first two games over number five seed Temple University 78-65 and number four seed University of Wisconsin 87-69 before falling to number one seed University of Kentucky 62-45 in the Sweet Sixteen. They were the first Ivy League team to reach the Sweet Sixteen since the 1978–79 Penn Quakers and set an Ivy League record with 29 wins.\nPreseason.\nThe Ivy League held its pre-season media day on October 28, 2009 in Princeton, New Jersey. The league's media unanimously voted Cornell the preseason #1 for the second straight season. Cornell returned all five starters, three all-conference performers, and the Ivy League rookie and defensive players of the year from the 2009 Ivy League championship team.\nTwo Ivy League seniors were named preseason candidates for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award. Columbia's Patrick Foley and Brown's Matthew Mullery were named to the 30-man preseason list.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference.\nPreseason #1 Cornell lived up to its billing by scoring the first Ivy League win over one of the six major conferences as the Big Red beat the SEC's Alabama Crimson Tide 71–67 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, behind Ryan Wittman's 23 points. It was Cornell's first win over a current SEC member school since the Big Red defeated Arkansas (then a part of the Southwest Conference) during the 1972–73 season.\nHarvard also got off to a fast start. After winning their opener against Holy Cross, the Crimson won a triple-overtime contest over the College of William &amp; Mary, 87–85 on a half-court shot by senior guard Jeremy Lin. Lin also made headlines in early December as he scored 30 points in a close loss (79–73) at #14 Connecticut, then came back to score 25 in the Crimson's very next game – a 74–67 upset of Boston College. Lin started the New Year by being named to the Mid-season Wooden Award 30-man watch list and the Bob Cousy Award.\nThe Ivy made news for some not-so positive reasons as the conference saw two coaches fired during the pre-conference slate. Penn fired coach Glen Miller after an 0–7 start, while Dartmouth's Terry Dunn resigned after a 3–10 start.\nBut the biggest press of the non-conference season for the Ivy League came on January 6, as league favorite Cornell led #1 and undefeated Kansas with under a minute remaining at Allen Fieldhouse. Ultimately, the Big Red lost to KU 71–66, but the Ivy stalwarts proved that they could compete with the top teams\nConference season.\nCornell and Harvard were expected to compete for the league title, but the Big Red swept the Crimson. However, Penn stopped Cornell's bid for a perfect Ivy League season by beating the then 22nd ranked Big Red 79–64 at the Palestra in Philadelphia. The win snapped an eight-game win streak by Cornell.\nConference awards &amp; honors.\nAll-Conference teams.\nAt the conclusion of the season, the Ivy League all-conference teams were selected. Cornell placed a trio of seniors – Ryan Wittman, Jeff Foote and Louis Dale – on the All-Ivy first team. The Big Red threesome were joined on the first team by Harvard's Jeremy Lin and Penn's Zack Rosen. Wittman and Foote were the Ivy League player and defensive players of the year, respectively.\nAll-Ivy League first team\nAll-Ivy League second team\nAll-Ivy League honorable mention\nWeekly awards.\nIvy League Players of the Week&lt;br&gt;\nThroughout the conference season, the Ivy League offices name a player and rookie of the week."

        "text": "John Patrick Parnell \"Patsy\" Cahill (April 4, 1865 – October 31, 1901) was an American Major League Baseball outfielder. In addition to playing the outfield, Cahill played third base and shortstop and pitched 10 games.\nThere is speculation that Cahill was the inspiration for Ernest Lawrence Thayer's poem \"Casey at the Bat\" after Thayer reportedly saw Cahill play in Stockton, California.\nProfessional career.\nColumbus Buckeyes.\nCahill signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Quakers in December 1883 but on May 19, 1884 his contract was purchased from the Quakers by the Columbus Buckeyes. Cahill began his professional career with the Buckeyes of the American Association in 1886. He played in 59 games and batted .219 with 46 hits, three doubles, three triples and six base on balls in 210 at bats.\nSt. Louis Maroons.\nIn 1885 Cahill played for the Atlanta ball club of the Southern Association. He returned to the major leagues in 1886 playing for the St. Louis Maroons of the National League. Cahill hit only .199 with 92 hits with 17 doubles, six triples, one home run, 32 RBIs with 16 stolen bases.\nIndianapolis Hoosiers.\nOn March 8, 1887 Cahill was purchased by the Indianapolis Hoosiers from the St. Louis Maroons. Cahill would play out his final season in the Major Leagues with the Hoosiers batting .205 with 54 hits, four doubles, three triples, 26 RBIs and a career high 34 steals in 68 games. In addition to Cahill's batting statistics he also pitched a career high six games, including one start. He went 0–2 with a 14.32 ERA with five strikeouts.\nLegacy.\nCahill played the rest of his career in the minor leagues. Stops Cahill made included the Eau Claire, Wisconsin ball club of the Northwestern League, the Oakland Colonels of the California League, the Bloomington Reds of the Central Interstate League, the Stockton, California ball club of the California League, back to Oakland, then to the Sacramento Senators, back to Oakland, then to the Rock Island-Moline Twins in the Illinois–Indiana League, the Dallas Hams in the Texas League, the Fort Worth Panthers, the Denison Tigers of the Texas Southern League and then back to Fort Worth.\nHe was also an umpire after his playing career was over but Cahill died soon after that in 1901 at the age of 36 in Pleasanton, California and was buried at Saint Mary Cemetery, in Oakland, California."

        "title": "List of centuries in women's Test cricket",
        "text": "Test cricket is the longest version of the sport of cricket. Test matches are played between international teams of eleven players each over four innings; each team bats twice. In the women's variant, the game is scheduled to last four days of play. The Women's Cricket Association was formed in England in 1926, and the first women's Test was played between England and Australia in 1934. The English team were on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, arranged by the WCA. The International Women's Cricket Council was formed in 1958 as the governing body for women's cricket. In 2005, women's cricket was brought under the International Cricket Council along with men's cricket; at that time 89 of the council's 104 members had started developing women's cricket. As of June 2022, a total of ten teams have played a total of 144 women's Test matches and 2 matches were abandoned. England have played the most matches (98) while Sri Lanka, Ireland and the Netherlands have played only one Test each.\nA century is a score of a hundred or more runs in an innings. The first century in women's Test cricket was scored in 1935 by Myrtle Maclagan, who made 119 runs for England against Australia. Since then, a total of 108 centuries, including seven double centuries, have been scored. Betty Snowball of England (189 runs) held the record for the highest individual score for over 51 years. She was the second cricketer to hold the record after Maclagan, a record which stood until Sandhya Agarwal of India surpassed it by a single run in 1986. Following Agarwal the record was held by Denise Annetts (Australia, 1987), Kirsty Flavell (New Zealand, 1996), Karen Rolton (Australia, 2001), Mithali Raj (India, 2002), and the current record holder Kiran Baluch of Pakistan who, in 2004, scored 242 runs against the West Indies. Janette Brittin of England has scored five centuries in a Test career spanning 27 matches and 44 innings, the most hundreds in women's Test match history. Flavell scored the first double century in women's Test cricket in 1996; over the next eight years five more double centuries were scored, by Joanne Broadbent (Australia, 1998), Michelle Goszko (Australia, 2001), Karen Rolton (Australia, 2001), Mithali Raj (India, 2002), and Kiran Baluch (Pakistan, 2004), which was then succeeded by a 13 year wait until Ellyse Perry of Australia scored the next one in 2017. , Australia and England have the most centurions (23 players each) while English players have scored the most centuries (44 times).\nThe first part of this list includes all players who have scored a Test century. The list is organised in chronological order; in cases where more than one player has scored a century in the same match or innings, the player who started batting earlier is listed first. The second part of the list provides an overview of century scores by Test playing teams. Teams are listed in the order of debut; in cases where two teams played their first match together, the host team is listed first."

        "title": "UMass Lowell River Hawks men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The UMass Lowell River Hawks men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents the University of Massachusetts Lowell. It competes at the NCAA Division I level in the Hockey East Association. The team competed at the Division II level until 1983. That year the University of Lowell was raised to D1 in hockey only and joined the newly formed Hockey East Association. Thirty years later with a name change to both the school and the team, the University of Massachusetts Lowell claimed their first Hockey East regular season title and HEA Tournament championship in 2013. The River Hawks made their first Frozen Four in 2013 as well. UMass Lowell would repeat as Hockey East champions in 2014 and then again in 2017.\nThe River Hawks have played at The Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell since its opening in January 1998.\nProgram history.\nEarly years.\nThe roots of the current hockey program can be traced back to when the university was called the Lowell Technological Institute (LTI). Hockey started as a club program in 1965–66, and the team was named the Terriers and coached by Richard Morrison. The program initially used the Billerica Forum for practices and home games. The original rink was outdoors at Cushing Field on North Campus. In 1969, Coach Bill Riley was hired to take over the program and was at the helm of a very colorful run for the next 21 years. After LTI's 1975 merger with Lowell State College to become the University of Lowell, the team became known as the Chiefs but were still without a proper facility. But lack of a proper rink was no deterrent for Coach Riley, who benefited from an increase in homegrown talent. Bobby Orr and the Big Bad Bruins of the late 1960s and early 1970s helped grow the game during the Baby Boomer era in Massachusetts.\nFor the decade of the UMass Lowell program years, \"home\" games were conducted in a nomadic manner with the team never playing near campus, as no such facility existed in Lowell. Games were played mostly at Skate 3 Ice Arena in Tyngsboro, and it was still technically UMass Lowell's home rink during their first Division 2 Championship run in 1979. In 1980, the university was able to purchase the Billerica Forum (then called the Merrimack Valley Forum) after the allocation of money pushed for by State Senator B. Joseph Tully. The money, however, only provided for the purchase of the structure and land. Though only constructed in 1964, the Merrimack Valley Forum was called a \"pig pen\" by Coach Riley. A few years later, State Senator Phil Shea was able to secure $500,000 in funding for renovations of the Forum. The coaching staff became the foreman and applied for federal job training grants in order to bring in tradespeople to help with the work. Soon the Chiefs had a place they could call home and rechristened it as Tully Forum.\nThe Riley era.\nDuring the team's formative years in the early 1970s, the Chiefs had no conference affiliation besides a loose one with surrounding schools in the ECAC. By the mid-1970s, Riley had started to assemble the core of players who would lead to UMass Lowell to their first national championship: Tom Jacobs from Hudson, Dean Jenkins from Billerica, and future NHL regular Craig McTavish. However, an envious spat began in the Merrimack Valley between Lowell and Merrimack College, just up the road in North Andover. Merrimack's hockey program was what Lowell had aspired to be: a national contender with a modern home rink on campus. But, up until the 1978–79 season, the Merrimack-UMass Lowell rivalry stood at a very one sided 1–13–1, in Merrimack's favor.\nWith a new post season tournament being sponsored by the NCAA in 1978, Merrimack crushed the competition, including UMass Lowell, in the ECAC tournament and followed it up by going on a tournament run without challenge, defeating both Mankato State and Lake Forest College by a combined score of 18–3. The obsession with Merrimack had grown and festered from the year before. But, with some advance scouting, Coach Riley believed 1979 was the year the Chiefs would jump onto the national stage.\nWith the help of his student section, dubbed the \"Wild Men,\" Riley wanted to crack the Merrimack goalie, Gilles Moffet, as their defensive depth had taken an early season hit. Their first meeting came right before Thanksgiving, and a theme of turkeys became prevalent in the Wild Men's antics toward Merrimack. The leader of the Wild Men went as far as to send super-imposed pictures of a turkey attached to the Merrimack Goalie to his dorm room. Even Coach Riley had a troll up his sleeve and sent the Wild Men's leader up to New Hampshire to purchase a turkey and tie it up in front of the Merrimack goal. Once the turkey was on the ice, a Lowell 'Wild Woman' ran onto the ice to rescue it. However, the pranks and trolling didn't faze the Merrimack goalie.\n\"We outshot them something like three to one because they were so weak on defense,\" says Riley, \"But wouldn't you know, they still tied us, 3–3. It was all our own fault because the goalie was damned if he was going to let the puck in the net.\"\nGoing into the 1979 season and speaking at an alumni dinner trying drum up support for the hockey program, Coach Riley wrote a very big check with his wordage toward the upcoming season.\n\"We had an alumni fundraiser before the season, and I was up on the podium trying to jazz up the alumni,\" Riley related. \"I don't remember what I said at the beginning of my speech, but at the end I said that if we don't win the national championship this year, it will be a disappointing season.\"\nStill playing at Skate 3 Tyngsboro, Coach Riley sought to distill an attitude of us against the world, according to members of the 1979 Chiefs team. Team morale was not very high, and the Chiefs struggled in the early part of the season.\n\"We were playing like a bunch of punks,\" says Riley. \"I was so mad, I hit the locker room door as hard as I could to prove a point. Sometimes, you role play as a coach. I could even put tears in my eyes to emphasize a point. But, this time, I didn’t have to role play. I was really mad. As soon as I hit it, I knew I’d broken something. The next day, I walked in and had it in a cast. I was hiding it inside my sports jacket. For three-quarters of the pre-game meal, I looked like Napoleon. Of course, there was no real hiding it. It was pretty embarrassing, says Riley. I’d go to the bank teller and she’d say, What happened to your arm? Oh, you don’t want to know. No, tell me, what happened to your arm? Well, I punched a locker room door. And she’d give me that look, like, Oh, how childish, how juvenile, how immature.\"\nAfter that point, UMass Lowell went 24–2 and with the addition of future All-American Paul Lohnes, of the Blue Line, and Mark Jenkins, who had transferred from Union forgoing a pro contract to use his last year of eligibility to play with his brother Dean. Things began to click for the Chiefs and even rival Merrimack could not escape the wrath of the Chiefs, who had been 1–13–1 against Merrimack until the 1978–79 season. After narrowly beating Salem State College in the ECAC Championship, Lowell made their first appearance in the Division 2 National Championship. Being hosted at the Volpe Center in Merrimack gave Lowell de facto home ice, and they cruised past Illinois-Chicago in the semifinal game and made very easy work of Mankato State in the Championship game, winning 6–4.\n2 in 3: Bump to Division I.\nAfter moving into Tully in 1980 and making the barn on Rte. 129 a permanent home for the Chiefs, the program was rewarded with two more national championships, in 1981 &amp; 1982, with same core group of guys from the 1979 run. In 1981, UMass Lowell was facing Plattsburgh State (NY) for the Championship at Tully Forum. Knowing that Dave Poulin on Plattsburgh State was prone to spastic reactions when thrown off his game, Coach Riley set in on him to take him out of the game mentally. Poulin was to be pressured, hit, and squeezed by the Chiefs players. The strategy worked until Poulin, who had been sent off the ice early, ran into some \"trouble\" in the locker room underneath the stands.\n\"The kid was so mad, he starting pulling the pipes off the wall,\" says Riley. \"Eventually, he pulled off the water pipes. The rink manager came over to me while the second period was still going and said, 'Listen, Billy, that big forward Poulin from Plattsburgh pulled the pipes right out of the wall. There’s water spraying all over their locker room. What do you want me to do?' I said, You know what I want you to do. Don’t do a thing until the third period. Then turn the water off. Sure enough, the Plattsburgh team was going into the third period for the national championship and they had water spraying all over their locker room during intermission. They probably went in the showers to stay dry.\"\nDuring this time the rivalry with Merrimack was a more even match, the hate, or one might say envy, for the school in North Andover burned the same in Coach Riley.\n\"I was ranting and raving,\" he says. \"I got to the end of my vociferous dialogue and said, 'I hate Merrimack. I hate their school. I hate the color of their uniforms. I hate the Indian chief on their shirts… I even hate their #$%@&amp; zip code. I had just run out of things to hate,\" he says laughing.\"What you have to understand,\" he adds with a straight face, \"is that we had always looked up to Merrimack, so what I said, I said affectionately.\"\nAfter the 1983–1984 season, Lowell pushed forward to Division 1 and a new league was now forming in the area amongst the former ECAC schools. Although, not all of those schools were keen on the idea of admitting Lowell to the newly formed union. Boston College, in particular, was no friend of Lowell. The Chiefs had beaten them as a D2 school and one could speculate did not want to view Lowell on the same level as fellow institutions joining Hockey East. Clarkson and St. Lawerence were considering joining Hockey East and carried voting powers at this time. In the eleventh hour, both schools voted Lowell into the league and then committed to joining the ECAC. Coach Riley later recounted,\n\"\"This was before cell phones and I dropped a lot of quarters into pay phones at the rink making calls. I think I spent more time on the phone than I did on the ice. It was stressful, and it took a lot out of me.\" \"\nLowell's transition to Division 1 was led by Chelmsford Native and future NHL stalwart Jon Morris. Northeastern Coach and Gold Medal Winner Ben Smith gave Morris the nickname of Ghost,\n\"He'd be in front of their defensemen, then vanish and reappear behind them. \"\nJon Morris is still the All-Time Leading Scorer in Hockey East History recording 177 points over his 4 years with the Chiefs. The Chiefs posted their first 20+ win season at the Division 1 Level in 1986-1987. The following season Lowell recorded another 20+ win season and made their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament bowing out to Wisconsin in the First Round. The next 3 years Lowell posted Sub .500 records and after the 1990-1991 season, Riley decided to retire. There had been some friction between University administrator and Riley and after 21 years of service to the University, Riley decided to step aside. At the time there was an NCAA investigation into the program due to a pep talk between the 2nd and 3rd period of a game against Boston University. Jack Parker and Coach Riley had played together at Boston University during the 1960s. While Lowell had sustained success against Boston College beating Boston University had always been too tall of a task for the Chiefs. Coach Riley decided to put his money where his mouth is with his boys.\n\"“Unlike a lot of schools, the university never fed the guys after the game. They were just supposed to go out on their own even though they hadn’t had anything to eat since before four o’clock in the afternoon. So I gave a pep talk between the second and third period. I threw down a couple hundred dollars and said, Listen, if we win this game, the party’s on me\"\"\nThe Chiefs won the game but the incident was the icing on the cake on the cantankerous relationship that Riley had with the then current administration\n\"“They wanted to say that I was paying the kids, but it was just that the pizza was on me, Sometimes, the pioneers are the ones with the arrows in their backs. The president that we have here now, and was there at the time, never wanted us to go Division I. I got a lot of things here in spite of his wishes. Even when you beat your boss, you still lose down the road.”\"\nThe Crowder Era: the Rise of the River Hawks.\nThe lineage of the program and the mark Riley left on the program continues onto the present era. Norm Bazin now coach of the River Hawks was recruited by Riley and donned the \"Ranger\" style era Lowell across his chest at the Tully.\nWith Riley retiring a search was put out for a new coach and Lowell brought in former Boston Bruin and then at the time Maine assistant Maine Coach Bruce Crowder. Crowder was instrumental in the rise of the Maine Hockey program under legendary coach Shawn Walsh. Crowder first season was a sub 500 record, but the following season Lowell posted a 20 win season missing the NCAA tournament. The Chiefs were showing signs of things to come with Dwayne Roloson in net and the suburb first line pairing of Mike Murray and Shane Henry. The 1993–1994 season would be the last season under the Chiefs moniker. Though not without its detractors the new nickname would have to be found.\nFreshman phenom and Hockey East leading scorer Greg Bullock made his debut with the Chiefs in 1993–1994. Bullock's greatest attribute was his skating ability with a background in power and figure skating. Bullock took full advantage of his lateral skating ability creating many opportunities for himself on uncorralled rebounds. The season itself was Lowell's great success up until that point in Division 1. Crowder was able to scale the mountain that was Boston University in February 1994 and played a memorably infamous home series against Maine the following weekend. In front of two sold-out crowds at Tully Forum what appears in the record book as wins for Lowell. Were in fact actually two ties against the Black Bears. Due to an academic scandal with the Maine Hockey program, Lowell has been retroactively rewarded wins for this series. Lowell finished second in Hockey East and made their first appearance in the Championship game at the Boston Garden losing a 3–2 game to Jack Parker's Terriers. Given at At-Large bid in the 1994 NCAA Tournament Lowell was sent West and was forced to play a de facto home game against Michigan State at Munn Ice Arena in East Lansing in the 1st round. Grinding out a 4–3 win Lowell moved on to face the Minnesota Golden Gophers the next night in front of heavily attended Minnesota crowd. The two teams skated to a 1–1 tie for the first 60 minutes of regulation in a very tight game. During the first overtime, Minnesota Jeff Nielsen potted the game-winning goal off of a Lowell turnover ending the hopes of a Frozen Four appearance.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nSpencer Penrose Award\nMike Richter Award\nAll-American teams.\nAHCA Division II All-Americans\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC 2.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nAll-Conference teams.\nAll-ECAC 2\nHockey East.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nGoaltending Champions\nCoach of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nLen Ceglarski Award\nThree-Stars Award\nTournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond team\nThird Team\nRookie Team\nProgram Records.\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Massachusetts Lowell alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nMassachusetts–Lowell River Hawks Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Massachusetts–Lowell men's ice hockey program who were elected into the University of Massachusetts Lowell Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nRiver Hawks in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "The men's pommel horse competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. It was held on 5, 7, and 10 September at the Baths of Caracalla. There were 128 competitors from 28 nations, with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 2 gymnasts. There was a tie for first place in the pommel horse. Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union and Eugen Ekman of Finland each received a gold medal. It was the third consecutive Games with a gold medal for the Soviets, as Shakhlin became the first man to successfully repeat as Olympic champion in the event (and second to win multiple medals of any color). Ekman's medal was the only medal in men's artistic gymnastics in 1960 that did not go to the Soviet Union or Japan. Third place and the bronze medal went to Japan's Shuji Tsurumi.\nThe 1960 gymnastics competitions introduced apparatus finals, with the all-around competition serving as a qualifying round for the pommel horse final.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Five of the top 11 (including ties for 9th) gymnasts from 1956 returned: gold medalist Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union, silver medalist Takashi Ono of Japan, fifth-place finisher Yury Titov of the Soviet Union, sixth-place finisher Jaroslav Bím of Czechoslovakia, and seventh-place finisher Masao Takemoto of Japan. Shakhlin was also the reigning (1958) world champion.\nMorocco and South Korea each made their debut in the men's pommel horse; the short-lived United Arab Republic made its only appearance. The United States made its ninth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics all-around events continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to two individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. \nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the new apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 130th. For the apparatus finals, the all-around score for that apparatus was multiplied by one-half then added to the final round exercise score to give a final total.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, with the final total apparatus score from 0 to 20."

        "title": "Gymnastics Australia",
        "text": "Gymnastics Australia (GA) is the governing body for the sport of gymnastics in Australia.\nHistory.\nGymnastics in Australia is thought to have originated in the early 20th century by eastern European immigrants. It wasn't until after World War I, when Australia was in the Great Depression, that people started turning to organisations like the YWCA for support. From these community-based groups, the sport began to flourish. Around the same time, gymnastics was included in the Geelong Grammar, Wesley College and Carey Grammar school curriculum. Australians participated in the sport for the first time at an Olympic Games at the Melbourne Games in Melbourne.\nThe body was founded on 8 September 1949 as the Australian Gymnastics Union (AGU), with representatives from Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. After the formation of this national body, the first Australian National Championships for men were held in Melbourne in 1950, with subsequent competitions held annually in ongoing years.\nAffiliation was accepted by the Australian Olympic Federation in 1951 and by the International Federation of Gymnastics in 1954, at which point AGU began conforming to international regulations.\nWestern Australia became affiliated with the AGU in 1955, followed by South Australia in 1956.\nThe first international gymnastics competition was held in Melbourne as part of the 1956 Olympic Games, with full teams for both men and women competing in gymnastics for the first time. During this period, negotiations began to standardise gymnastics equipment in Australia, allowing for a better standard of training across the country.\nWhile women represented Australia in gymnastics at the 1956 Olympic Games, women were not included in the Australian Gymnastics Championships until 1959.\nIn 1961, AGU accepted the idea of including junior gymnastics championships for the first time. The first under 18 men's competition was introduced formally in 1965.\nIn 1968, the AGU formally changed its name to the Australian Amateur Gymnastic Union (AAGU), seeing the Australian Capital Territory becoming officially affiliated the following year. 1969 also saw the introduction of the first Under 19 Men's competition and the first under 16 Women's competition.\nTasmania became affiliated with the AAGU in 1970.\nIn 1977, AAGU changed its name again, becoming known as the Australian Gymnastic Federation (AGF). Rhythmic sportive gymnastics was included under the AGF umbrella at this time, which saw Men's and Women's Olympic Gymnastics being renamed to Men's Artistic Gymnastics (MAG) and Women's Artistic Gymnastics (WAG) within Australia as part of its national formation.\nAGF was part of the formation of the Commonwealth Gymnastic Federation in 1978.\nThe first international gymnastics medal for Australia was won by Lindsay Nylund from Western Australia, who placed second in the 1978 Canada Commonwealth Games All-Round, and contributed to the first Australian team medal, a bronze won by the Australian men's team, at the same Games. Further recognition came in 1979 as the Federation International de Gymnstique Elite pin, a recognition by the international governing body for performing at 90% or better on overall scores at a world championship or Olympic games, was awarded to Phil Cheetham, Lindsay Nylund, Kerry Bayliss and Marina Sulicich based on their performance at the 1979 World Championships.\nAGF was officially incorporated as a group in 1981, becoming Australian Gymnastic Federation Inc.\nAlso in 1981, the Australian Institute of Sport was established as a nationally-funded high-performance training centre for Australian athletes. It founding eight sports including gymnastics, which received its own specialised, fully equipped training gym in 1982. The AIS program began including rhythmic sportive gymnastics from 1983 onwards. The AIS gymnastics program was largely based in Canberra from 1981 until 2010, offering residential programs for both male and female athletes. In 2011, AIS gymnastics began being delivered as a camps based program, with all AIS athlete scholarships being discontinued at the end of 2013. Multiple states followed suit in setting up similar high-performance training programs, importing coaches with successful gymnastics program backgrounds from countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Romania and Japan to help run these programs, such as the WAIS program in 1988.\nAustralia's first international gold medal was won in 1989 by Ken Meredith from Queensland, winning at the Liberation Cup in Czechoslovakia. The first Australian team gold medal was awarded to the women's team at the 1990 Pacific Alliance Championships. The Pacific Alliance Championships also saw the men's team win bronze.\nIn 1994, Australia's national gymnastics teams competed at the Pacific Alliance in New Zealand and the Commonwealth Games in Canada to immense success. In New Zealand, the men's team won silver and the women's team won bronze, with the men winning 11 medals, women winning 5 medals and rhythmic team winning 6 medals (5 of which were gold) in Canada.\nA General Gymnastics Development Director was first appointed in 1986 (Peter Murden), to help develop and establish a new discipline of gymnastics to focus on a more recreational non-competitive participation style of gymnastics. At this time, the kindergym program was also formalised, with its first national coaching accreditation scheme approved.\nIn 1995, Sports Aerobics was established as a gymnastics discipline, with all Australian finalists at the world's first FIG Sport Aerobic World Championships being awarded FIG Elite Pins, as well as Australia walking away with a silver medal in the individual women's event, 5th in the pairs division and 7th in the trio division.\nIn 1995, an enquiry was held into the Women's Artistic Gymnastics program at the AIS surrounding abuse allegations, with the coach and program ultimately exonerated at the time.\nIn 2000, the AGF changed its name once more. Its current name is Gymnastics Australia.\nPresent day.\nGymnastics Australia runs a head office in Melbourne, Victoria, acting as Australia's representative body to FIG.\nGymnastics Australia coordinates and provides gymnastics for Australians through eight Association Members, managing a total of 247,073 registered athletes (77.7% female, 22.2% male, 0.03% other, 0.03% non-binary with 93% being under the age of 12), 627 affiliated clubs, 7807 coaches and 3099 judges at the end of 2022:\nGymnastics Australia sets the routines and routine guidelines for the National Levels Program which are used by gymnasts around the country.\nProminent Gymnastics Australia gymnasts.\nProminent gymnasts from Australia under Gymnastics Australia include:\n(TRA) Australia's ONLY Olympic Medal - Silver won at Sydney 2000 games\nGymsports under Gymnastics Australia.\nWithin Australia, there are currently 8 recognised types of gymnastics registered under Gymnastics Australia: Parkour, Gymnastics for All, Acrobatic Gymnastics, Aerobic Gymnastics, Trampoline, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Women's Artistic Gymnastics and Men's Artistic Gymnastics.\nUntil 2018, Gymnastics Australia was also the governing body for cheerleading within Australia, recognising it as a type of gymsport. However, they stepped down from this role in 2018.\nParkour.\nParkour is the newest gymsport recognised by the International Federation of Gymnastics, with athletes facing a range of obstacles including bars, ramps and boxes up to 2.5m tall across the space. Within the space, they compete in two events: speed and freestyle. In speed, the goal is to make it through two laps of obstacles within the fastest time. In freestyle, athletes are given 70 seconds to impress the judges with their skills on the obstacles, bars and floor, with points given for difficulty and deducted for execution errors.\nGymnastics for All.\nGymnastics for All serves as an entry point into gymnastics within Australia, with a range of GfA programs falling under this gymsport banner that serve different purposes. These include:\nAcrobatic Gymnastics.\nAcrobatic gymnastics as a gymsport involving partnerships of gymnasts working together in Pairs(Men's, Women's and Mixed) or Groups (women's trios) or (men's four) to perform figures of static acrobatics such as balances and holds, dynamic acrobatics such as lifts, throws and twists, tumbling and dance set to music. The Acrobats perform a Balance exercise, a Dynamic exercise and in international categories, a Combined exercise. The Combined exercise was once a routine performed only in a final, however nowadays the Combined exercise is considered as an \"apparatus\" of its own. With then it being repeated for the finals. \nAerobic Gymnastics.\nAerobic gymnastics combines mainstream aerobic exercise sequences with gymnastics difficulty elements, transitions, interactions between athletes and lifts, inspired by the music that the athletes perform to.\nTrampoline.\nTrampoline focuses on teaching aerial skills across three apparatus and four disciplines:\nRhythmic Gymnastics.\nRhythmic gymnastics blends sport and art, with gymnasts competing on a 13m2 floor to music, incorporating four different apparatus to showcase movements including throws, circles and spirals. Rhythmic gymnastics calls on flexibility, musical interpretation and acrobatics, being influenced by ballet and modern dance. The apparatus must be kept in constant motion, being used by both hands and thrown into the air, with gymnasts using a rope, hoop, ball, clubs and/or ribbon.\nWomen's Artistic Gymnastics (WAG).\nWomen's artistic gymnastics is a highly competitive and visually captivating sport, featuring a range of disciplines performed by female athletes, with routines scored on execution, degree of difficulty and artistry/presentation. It comprises four primary components:\nMen's Artistic Gymnastics (MAG).\nMen's artistic gymnastics is a highly competitive and physically demanding sport, involving male athletes performing a series of routines across six different apparatuses while being scored on execution, difficulty and presentation. These apparatus include:\nCheerleading (Gymsport from 2002 - 2018).\nGymnastics Australia began acting as the governing body of Australian cheerleading in 2002, including the sport under their \"General Gymnastics\" stream and establishing a working committee led by Nerine Cooper, as well as holding the first national championship. By 2004, Gymnastics Queensland had begun recognising cheerleading as its own unique cheersport, with Gymnastics Australia soon following.\nIn July 2008, GA formed the Australian Cheer Union (ACU) as a branch of GA to serve as the body to standardise cheer rules, advance coach and judge education and safety, and coordinate a national calendar for cheerleading. ACU as a GA branch would be recognised as the official governing body by the International Cheerleading Federation (ICF), International All Star Federation (IASF), International Cheerleading Union (ICU) and the Australian Sports Commission (ASC).\nHowever after a steady decline in participation in GA's cheerleading programs despite growth in programs under other providers, many attempts at independent consultants restructuring their governance, and a petition asking for GA to resign as governing body, GA finally stepped from their role as the official governing body of cheerleading in Australia in 2018 and ceased recognising cheerleading as a gymsport.\nAbuse Investigations.\nOver its history, Gymnastics Australia has been embroiled in a number of abuse investigations due to incidents that have happened under their governance, which have exposed a long-standing culture of abuse within gymnastics in Australia.\nOpie Report - 1995.\nIn 1995, the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) high-performance Women's Artistic Gymnastics program faced accusations of Coach Mark Calton being emotionally, verbally and physically abusive to athletes under his care. These allegations included Calton allegedly hitting a 10-year-old gymnast, and two gymnasts alleging their coach had called them \"fat\" and \"ugly\".\nWithin the same year, a former AIS gymnast filed a lawsuit against the Australian Sport Commission, alleging that the AGF/AIS high-performance training program had caused her to suffer from anorexia nervosa.\nAs a result, Sports Minister John Faulkner commissioned Hayden Opie, an independent sports lawyer, to examine these allegations and conduct a thorough investigation.\nThe subsequent report, known as the Opie Report, claimed that the physical assault of the 10-year-old gymnast had resulted after the child had \"provoked Calton into losing his self-control\", but ultimately did not find that Calton had struck her. Opie recommended counselling for the coach, and not the gymnast, while also dismissing the emotional abuse allegations as the terms \"fat\" and \"ugly\" were often used in high-performance training environments within gymnastics. Ultimately, the report concluded that \"\"No systematic or widespread abuse of AIS female gymnasts has been found to occur at any time. Major change at the AIS is not necessary.\"\nThis investigation was criticised for being constrained by a narrow framework, and not addressing the broader issues within the sport, resulting in the report's recommendations addressing symptoms as band-aid fixes rather than the underlying problems. It has also been criticised for legitimising and approving of abusive activities occurring.\nCritics also pointed out that \"All parties involved in the sport of gymnastics had an interest in containing any perceived problems that might threaten the sport.\"\nDobbs Trial and Sentencing - 2003.\nIn July 2003, Australian gymnastics coach, Geoffery Robert Dobbs, was formally sentenced to life in jail with no prospect of parole on charges of molesting and producing child sexual abuse material of 62 girls aged from 12 months to 15 years old between 1972 and 1999. Detectives believed that in total, he may have abused more than 300 girls, leaving up to 240 alleged victims unaccounted for. His victims included athletes whom he had obtained access to through his role as a gymnastics coach.\nBelooussov Coach Suspension - 2013.\nIn 2021, the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) responded to enquiries by the ABC to confirm the 2013 suspension of husband and wife coaches, Sasha and Olga Belooussov, for an 18-month period for the verbal abuse of a gymnast.\nThis suspension had remained unreported for eight years due to the complaint handling process by Gymnastics Australia, which had meant that those involved, including the verbally abused gymnast and GA, were barred from speaking due to confidentiality provisions.\nDespite this period of suspension, the Belooussov couple returned to coaching gymnastics in Australia, returning to their roles as personal coaches for Georgia Godwin (Australian Commonwealth Games and Olympian medalist), GA assistant coach, coaching at Queensland gymnastics club Delta Gymnastics, and winning the GA WAG International Coach/Coaching Team of the Year Award in 2019.\nNational Centre of Excellence Investigation - 2018.\nDuring January 2018, the gymnastics world was exposed to the horrors of abuse in gymnastics as the Larry Nassar abuse trial played out publicly, raising awareness of child safety in sports, particularly within gymnastics, with victim Aly Raisman urging sporting bodies to ensure safeguards to ensure the mistakes of the United States were not repeated.\nIn response to the Larry Nassar case, Gymnastics Australia CEO Kitty Chiller made a statement regarding how the USA scandal had prompted GA to carry out an audit of their processes and policies, including an education process to empower \"any young member or any member of a gymnastics association to know that they have a voice and to know where that voice will be heard.\"\nKitty Chiller also at the time denied that GA had an existing problem with child abuse, stating \"there's never been any evidence or complaints that anyone's been unhappy within the Gymnastics Australia environment\" and GA's audit did not uncover any practices that needed to be changed.\nHowever, within the same year, parents reported to Gymnastics Australia that their children as young as eight were being regularly verbally and physically abused at the GA National Centre of Excellence (NCE) in Melbourne.\nIn these complaints, parents alleged their children were punished via methods such as \"making them swing on the bar until their hands bled, doing squats until their knees gave out, or making them do handstands and stay upside down until they felt sick and fell over\" with punishments being given for any misdemeanour from being perceived as not paying attention or being cheeky to not performing to the coach's standards. Athletes were also allegedly regularly yelled at multiple times within a training session, and not being allowed to comfort one another, with training sessions being closed to parents despite medical appointments occurring during training sessions. ABC News confirmed 16 parents, with the majority of their children being under the age of 15 years old and spending between 20 and 33 hours a week training at the NCE.\nWhen the parents took their complaints formally to GA, GA appointed an independent investigator in May. However, after receiving an interim report from the independent investigator, GA closed the investigation in August, with a letter from Kitty Chiller to the parents citing that the majority of allegations were \"incomplete\" and \"based on the investigator's interim report, GA did not find that any staff member was in breach of their employment with GA\". This letter also stated that \"the investigation took longer than anticipated and an extension would likely increase the burden placed on all parties involved\" with no fault or wrongdoing being concluded.\nGeorge Tatai, who spent 21 years on the GA board and eight years as a member of the International Gymnastics Federation, holding an Order of Australia Medal for his work in the sport, spoke out against the way that GA handled this investigation stating that they were paying lip-service to the parents' concerns and protecting GA ahead of the athletes.\nOne of the mothers then went on to make a formal complaint in 2020, using the newly formed GA independent complaints process, the \"Supplementary Complaints Management Process\" (SCMP), to allege that Kitty Chiller should not have closed this investigation as the CEO of Gymnastics Australia at the time. This 2020 complaint was then closed and never investigated, being deemed out of scope as the SCMP limited valid complaints to only those involving direct conduct towards an athlete, therefore excluding officials who may have handled historical complaints or had knowledge of abuse from investigation under this process.\nHowever new information was discovered in 2022 in Senate Estimates that found that the SCMP was co-drafted by those within Kitty Chiller's office, with GA providing input into the policy's design instead of the process being fully independent.\nWhen the SCMP policy was announced in 2020, Sport Integrity Australia (SIA) and the National Sports Tribunal (NST) had released a media statement confirming they would play a key role in the SCMP policy, with SIA facilitating an independent and comprehensive assessment of individual complaints and assisting with the management and coordination of investigation in accordance with assessor recommendations while NST planned to provide mediation, conciliation and tribunal hearings as needed.\nWith the release of this information within the Senate Estimates, ABC News began an investigation to explore who had made the decision to exclude officials from investigations under the SCMP, resulting in SIA, NST and GA all making conflicting statements to the ABC reporters. SIA stated that it was GA who was ultimately responsible for the SCMP, with the policy being developed by the NST for the board of GA to provide approval with SIA's input being only on sections relevant to their role. The NST statement stated that SCMP was a GA policy, and as such, GA was involved in its development up to board level, noting that both SIA and the NST assisted GA in its development. Meanwhile, GA distanced itself completely from the policy, stating that the policy \" was developed by the NST, with input from SIA, in relation to their role in the process. This policy was endorsed by the Gymnastics Australia Board.\"\nAustralian Human Rights Commission Investigation - 2020 - 2021.\nIn 2020, the documentary film Athlete A was released, following investigative journalists as they broke the story of USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar sexually assaulting young female gymnasts, and the following allegations and trials around USA Gymnastics regarding the abuse they had suffered.\nIn the aftermath of the documentary release, dozens of Australian gymnasts took to social media to speak their own allegations of abuse within Australian gymnastics, exposing that the culture wasn't unique to gymnastics within the U.S.\nAs a result, Gymnastics Australia (GA) announced an independent review of its own culture and practices, stating \"those experiences are simply not acceptable.\"\nFor this review, GA requested the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to act as the independent body to ensure the integrity of the review, with the report completed in 2021.\nThis report was undertaken by a dedicated team of AHRC staff, led by the Sex Discrimination Commission with input from the National Children's Commissioner. These staff all had expertise in responding sensitively in a trauma informed way to a range of issues such as sexual assault, sexual harassment and abuse. While the original planned release date was within the first quarter of 2021, the community interest in the review was so strong that AHRC extended its consultation timeline to allow more participation with the review.\nParticipation opened in September 2020, with all past and present members of the gymnastics community in Australia including athletes, coaches, staff, volunteers and administrators being encouraged to participate through a series of focus groups, interviews and written submissions.\nPolicies and procedures were also reviewed by AHRC, with the way these policies and procedures were implemented and the governance structures surrounding this implementation being examined.\nThroughout the investigation, athletes spoke out about the abusive techniques used in gymnastics training to the media, leading to lawyers forming groups to consider taking legal action due to athletes' statements that the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) had ignored allegations of physical and psychological abuse for decades.\nAHRC received a total of 138 written submissions to the enquiry, with 47 interviews being conducted with 57 participants. This included both current and former athletes, their families, staff, coaches and other relevant personnel.\nAHRC launched their final copy of the report on May 3, 2021, titled \"Changing the Routine\".\nThis report exposed an environment with a \"win at all costs\" mentality that normalised abuse, and a lack of understanding and prevention of the full range of child abuse and neglect behaviours in gymnastics, which was supported by a governance structure that was set up in an unsuitable manner for effective child safeguarding.\nA total of five overarching key findings were made in the report:\nAs a result of these findings, the report made a total of 12 recommendations:\nThroughout the review, AHRC recommended athletes utilise Sport Integrity Australia (SIA) as the appropriate independent body for abuse allegations. In total, SIA received 35 abuse allegations as a result, however only 7 of these allegations proceeded to investigations that were ongoing after the report was released.\nAs part of their response to the report, Sport Integrity Australia introduced the National Integrity Framework to apply to all sports in Australia in March 2021. This framework included an independent complaints handling model, with SIA encouraging all sports to adopt this model to ensure the independent and transparent handling of complaints moving forward within Australian sport.\nBy the end of 2022, the National Integrity Framework and its policies had been adopted by 81 recognised National Sporting Organisations in Australia, with the adoption of the Framework and its policies being a requirement for any sporting organisation applying to be recognised as the governing body within Australia to the Australian Sports Commission.\nHowever the introduction of the National Integrity Framework and its complaint policy saw controversy due to a conflict of interest held by the SIA/NST CEO, John Boultbee. John Boultbee was the director of the AIS from 1995 to 2001, overseeing a wide range of sports under the AIS banner including gymnastics. This led to the potential for a conflict of interest for any complaints regarding Boultbee's time at the AIS, which Boultbee himself acknowledged. However, Boultbee stated that in the event there were any matters that related to his time at the AIS, he would recuse himself from any role in the complaint.\nFurther concerns were raised in 2022 about the independent nature of this mechanism, as Kitty Chiller stepped down from her role at Gymnastics Australia as CEO to become deputy chief executive of the NST. When concerns were raised, NST confirmed that Kitty Chiller would have no involvement in any gymnastics matter that came before the tribunal.\nThe AHRC report highlights that abuse was occurring within the AGF/AIS gymnastics program as early as the early 1980s shortly after the program was established. As a result of this ASC issued an apology statement to AIS athletes, setting up an independent and confidential support service available to any former AIS athletes and staff to link with support services, in line with the report's 6th recommendation. The AIS also launched a restoration payment scheme, offering payments ranging from $5000 to $50,000 to athletes who suffered abuse during their time as scholarship holders between 1981 and 2013, as well as counselling and support services and engagement with senior representatives from btoh ASC and AIS.\nGymnastics Australia released an apology in the aftermath of the report's release also, stating Gymnastics Australia \"unreservedly apologises to all athletes and family members who have experienced any form of abuse participating in the sport\" as well as announcing their intention to adopt all 12 recommendations as overseen by their newly formed integrity committee.\nWhile the investigation had been actively underway in late 2020, Gymnastics Australia stated in their annual report that they had formally commenced the on-boarding process of signing up for the National Redress Scheme. This scheme was designed to assist people who had experienced institutional child sexual abuse to gain access to counselling, a personal response and a redress payment. By November 2022, Gymnastics Australia was yet to formally join the scheme, with gymnasts speaking out about this being yet another broken promise by Gymnastics Australia. In a May 2023 submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Implementation of the National Redress Scheme, Gymnastics Australia CEO Alexandra Ash confirmed that the governing body was in a financial position that prevented it from being accepted by the scheme. Gymnastics Australia finally formally joined the scheme in August 2023, more than two years after it began the process.\nSport Integrity Australia Investigations and GA Restorative Engagement Program - 2021 - 2022.\nAs part of the AHRC investigation, AHRC recommended Sport Integrity Australia as the appropriate independent body to report abuse allegations within Australian sport. At the conclusion of the AHRC investigation, SIA received 35 abuse allegation complaints, however only deemed 7 as worthy of an ongoing investigation after the report's release.\nOf these seven complaints, four were then returned with a finding of \"neither substantiated or unsubstantiated\", with the findings letter reminding complainants to maintain confidentiality. The families stated that they felt the process had let them down with their complaints not being properly heard or judged.\nGymnastics Australia took further action in 2022, launching its Restorative Engagement Program. This program aimed to provide a platform for both individuals and groups to formally convey their personal experiences that would then be used to inform changes to procedures, guidelines and behaviours within Gymnastics Australia control.\nAll athletes and their families who had made a formal complaint to SIA in 2020 were invited to take part in the Restorative Engagement Program on a voluntary basis.\nAs part of participation in this program, Gymnastics Australia asked these participants to sign a non-disclosure agreement, leading to condemnation by the athletes and their families as Gymnastics Australia was trying to gag their voices while not yet publicly acknowledging any of the abuse complaints that had been handled by SIA since the AHRC report release.\nWestern Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) investigation - 2021 - 2022.\nAs part of the larger 2020 AHRC investigation into gymnastics within Australia, a group of 20 former gymnasts from the Western Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) signed a joint submission regarding the physical, emotional and psychological abuse they had experienced as part of the WAIS gymnastics training culture.\nThese 20 gymnasts then took part in an ABC News investigation regarding the WAIS specific abuse, leading to WAIS to self-refer these allegations to Sport Integrity Australia for further investigation in April 2021.\nIn early May 2021, WAIS board chair Neil McLean released an apology statement in response to the AHRC's \"Changing the Rourtine\" report, stating:\nFormer WAIS gymnasts publicly criticised this apology, stating that it was weak, tokenistic, disingenuous and downplayed their experiences of abuse while training at WAIS.\nIn June 2021, Sport Integrity Australia confirmed that they would be independently investigating the abuse allegations from the WAIS gymnasts, with a goal to understand the culture of the WAIS program during its operation duration from 1987 to 2016, examining the athletes' experience of abuse and harm along with the effectiveness of the institute's current child safety policies and procedures. All athletes, parents, staff, coaches and personnel who had been a part of the WAIS Women's Artistic Gymnastics program were invited to make submissions.\nTo avoid any conflict of interest, WAIS Chief Executive Steve Lawrence removed himself from any involvement in the review.\nThe investigation included interviews and written submissions from a total of 92 participants, with 15,000 pages of documentation being examined. The final report was handed down in April 2022.\nThe final report found that \"it was reasonably likely that some gymnasts suffered abuse and/or harm while participating in the Program at WAIS. This includes things such as verbal and physical abuse, unnecessary skinfold testing, weight-shaming, the expectation to train and compete with injuries, and extreme training loads. The Review also found that the policies and procedures that governed the Program did not adequately protect some of the gymnasts.\"\nAs a result of this finding, four recommendations were made in the report:\nIn response to the recommendations, former WAIS gymnasts stated that the recommendation that they simply receive an apology did not go far enough, calling on the state government as well as national sporting peak bodies to hold those who were responsible accountable with further consequences. The Gymnast Alliance Australia also released a statement responding to the report, criticising that WAIS had downplayed the allegations as being historical when they had happened as recently as six years before the release of the report. The Gymnast Alliance Australia called on the Western Australian Government as well as Gymnastics Australia to hold independent investigations into those responsible in order to hold them accountable and avoid further harm to athletes in the future.\nWAIS made an additional public policy after the WAIS report was released, stating \"We are sorry that your experiences were painful rather than enjoyable and we apologise that elements of the WAIS program failed you. To those who experienced abuse and harm we apologise. Sport, elite sport included, is meant to be a healthy and enjoyable experience. We are sorry that this was not your experience.\"\nThis apology was critiqued upon its release for the inclusion of the statement \"Can we also note that SIA referred a number of allegations of sexual abuse and/or physical abuse to the relevant authorities who had the jurisdiction to investigate these allegation but none of these allegations progressed to investigation or charges and all have been closed\".\nThe Western Australian government issued a formal apology to WAIS gymnasts in June 2022, with Sport and Recreation Minister David Templeman directing the department to undertake a comprehensive governance and culture review of WAIS and the formation of a Specialist Child Safeguarding Unit for sport. They also announced that the Department would oversee and audit the implementation and compliance with the recommendations within the SIA report by WAIS.\nIn May 2023, WAIS acknowledge their April 2022 apology fell short and released a second apology as they prepared to participate in a reconciliatory and restorative process. At that time, the WAIS board also released a public commitment that included details on how they would act in the best interests of athlete health, wellbeing and safety.\nNorthern Districts Gymnastics Club controversy - 2021- 2022.\nAs part of the ongoing SCMP investigations, Sport Integrity Australia referred an investigation to the Western Australian police, which resulted in detectives laying charges in March 2021 regarding incidents involving a former gymnastics coach between February 2019 and December 2020 as part of his coaching work at the Northern Districts Gymnastics Club. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions discontinued these charges in June 2022.\nThe Northern Districts Gymnastics Club came under fire during the course of the investigation for their handling of the case, not informing parents of the allegations or charges, with the club defending this decision when a parent found out, removed their child and spoke out to the media.\nThe club stated that when they became aware of the allegations, the club sought legal advice from authorities, standing the coach down with full pay before later terminating his employment. The parent stated that they felt the club should have informed the parents about the allegations and charges and that the club was working with police, providing parents information about how to broach the subject to ensure that nothing had happened to their child for safeguarding purposes.\nPeggy Liddick Investigations and Sanctions - 2022.\nPeggy Liddick acted as the Australian women's artistic gymnastics team coach and boss between 1997 and 2016. In early 2022, the National Sports Tribunal found Liddick guilty of harassing two-time olympian gymnast, Georgia Bonora.\nLiddick denied all allegations of bullying and emotional abuse, however Bondora's complaint was supported by her former Australian teammates, Shona Morgan, Olivia Vivian, Chloe Gilliland and Ashleigh Brennan.\nThe complaint, alleging misconduct, bullying and abuse between 2006 and 2012, was initially lodged with Gymnastics Australia in 2020, before they forwarded it to Sport Integrity Australia in September 2020.\nUpon review, SIA upheld five allegations that were made against Liddick, with an appeal application to see the matter heard by the NST dismissing three allegations while upholding two.\nAs an outcome of the NST hearing, Liddick was suspended for four months and ordered to write an apology letter to Bondora which stated:"

        "text": "Benjamin Robert Smith (born 1 June 1986) is a retired New Zealand rugby union player, currently working for Super Rugby side Highlanders' management team. He formerly played for the in the Super Rugby competition, in the ITM Cup, Pau in the Top 14 and Kobelco Steelers in the Japan Rugby League One.\nSmith made his international debut for New Zealand in 2009, playing 84 tests from then until the 2019 Rugby World Cup. He was a key member of the 2015 Rugby World Cup-winning team. Smith was vice-captain of the All Blacks from 2016 to 2017 and captained the team once, against Samoa in 2017. He scored 39 tries for New Zealand throughout his international career, placing him amongst the all-time leading try scorers.\nHe normally played as an outside back, but has also previously played as a centre and halfback.\nSmith holds the international record (tied with seven English) of winning 14 games in a season, he was the only All Blacks player to play every match of 2013 in which all games were won, a very rare perfect season.\nPlaying career.\nProvincial rugby.\nBorn in Dunedin and educated at King's High School, Smith progressed through the junior ranks in the city at his beloved Green Island Rugby Club (The Grizzlies) before making his Air New Zealand Cup debut in 2008. He was one of the break-out stars of the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup, scoring six tries for Otago on route earning a year-end selection for the New Zealand national team (All Blacks). In the 2010 ITM Cup, however, he struggled to make the same impact as Otago endured a nightmare season and bottom-of-the-table finish, while Smith missed several matches while at the Commonwealth Games in India.\nSuper Rugby.\nSmith was selected to the squad for the 2009 Super 14 season\nIn 2010, Smith started every Highlander game, and scored two tries for the season. He played mainly on the wing, and earned one start at fullback while Israel Dagg was out injured.\nShifted back to his preferred position of fullback for the 2011 Super Rugby season, earned praise from coach Jamie Joseph and consideration for another All Blacks callup. He started every Highlander game for the third season running and added another two tries to his career total. In 2013 he continued as Highlanders fullback and was selected for the All Blacks to play on the wing against France.\nOn 5 December 2013, Smith won the Super Rugby Player of the Year award for the 2013 Super Rugby season.\nIn May 2015 Smith played his 100th Super Rugby game against the Western Force.\nIn 2017, Smith played his 127th game for the Highlanders in their Round 15 22–25 loss to the Crusaders, equalling Anton Oliver's record for the most capped Highlander ever. Unfortunately, Smith was taken off the field early in the second half for a concussion test- which was failed, after tripping over All Blacks teammate Ryan Crotty.\nSmith announced he would be departing the Highlanders to join Top 14 side Pau following the 2019 World Cup in Japan.\nTop 14.\nSmith started playing for Section Paloise, commonly known as Pau, in December 2019. He received a red-card on his debut, his only sending off of his professional career. His time in France was subsequently disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSection Paloise announced Smith's departure in July 2020 with the former All Black heading to Japan.\nJapan Rugby League One.\nKobe Steelers announced the signing of Smith ahead the 2021 Japan Rugby League One season on a one-year contract. Smith returned to play for the club in 2022 before announcing his retirement from rugby.\nInternational.\nEarly career.\nIn 2009 Smith was included in the 33-member All Blacks squad for the 2009 Autumn Internationals, ahead of veteran All Black winger Joe Rokocoko. Smith made his test debut for the All Blacks against Italy on 14 November 2009 at the San Siro, Milan, which the All Blacks won 20–6. He scored his first All Blacks try against the Barbarians in the last game of the tour which the Barbarians ran out winners 25–18 at Twickenham, London, on 5 December 2009.\nSmith did not figure into All Black squads in 2010, but was selected for the rugby sevens squad which competed at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, where he helped New Zealand to a gold medal finish.\n2012–2013.\nSmith made ten test appearances for the All Blacks in 2012, eight of which were off the bench.\nIn June 2013, he played &amp; featured in all 3 games against France in the French NZ Tour Series, on the right wing, with veteran Cory Jane ruled out due to injury. In the first game of the 3 Test Series at Auckland's Eden Park, he set up a try to Aaron Smith (in the 32nd minute) and was awarded man-of-the-match award. In the second game on 15 June at Christchurch's Rugby League Park, he scored a try in the 48th minute of the game. The final game of 3 Test Series, he again scored another in the 35th minute at New Plymouth's Yarrow Stadium. Smith would also form what would be a long-standing combination with fullback Israel Dagg during this series.\nIn August 2013, during the 2013 Rugby Championship, Smith scored 3 tries in the All Blacks 47–29 win against the Wallabies at Sydney's ANZ Stadium. The following week when the All Blacks faced the Wallabies at Wellington's Westpac Stadium, he scored 2 tries to help New Zealand win 27–16 and to retain the Bledisloe Cup.\nIn September 2013, Smith scored 2 tries to help the All Blacks win 33–15 against Argentina in La Plata.\nIn October 2013 following the close of the Rugby Championships, Smith was awarded with the record for the most tries in a Rugby Championship/Tri Nations series, scoring 8 tries in 6 matches. Smith continued this form into the end-of-year tests, scoring his eleventh test try of 2013 against Japan on 2 November that year, during a 54–6 win over the Japanese.\n2014–2015.\nIn 2014 Smith was named in the mid-year three-test series against England. Smith started on the right wing for the first test on 7 June 2014, in combination with Julian Savea on the left wing and Israel Dagg at fullback. Dagg was subbed off in the 54th minute due to injury, leaving Smith to start at fullback in the second test on 14 June 2014. Smith won Man of the Match in the second test of the series, a narrow 28–27 win, performing a try-saving tackle on English winger Manu Tuilagi and scoring a try in the 43rd minute.\nSmith started at fullback in six of his 12 appearances for the All Blacks in 2014, with Dagg struggling with persistent injury.\nOn 30 August 2015, he was named as one of the 31 members of the New Zealand Rugby World Cup team. Smith was the only fullback selected in the squad, with Cory Jane and Israel Dagg dismissed for Smith's Highlanders team-mate Waisake Naholo.\nSmith played in all seven of New Zealand's games at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, starting as fullback in all but one match (against Namibia, where he was substituted on for Colin Slade). He scored two tries in the competition, one against Namibia in their second pool match, and one against Tonga in their final pool game. He was awarded Man of the Match for his efforts in the semi-final against South Africa, which was won by a narrow 20–18.\nIn the final against Australia, he was yellow carded for a tip tackle, becoming the first player to receive a card in a Rugby World Cup Final. He returned to the pitch to help the All Blacks to a 34–17 victory, setting up replacement back Beauden Barrett for a try as the All Blacks became the first team ever to take back-to-back titles, as well as the first to win three Rugby World Cups.\n2016.\nIn 2016, after the international or complete retirements of All Black captain Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Tony Woodcock, Keven Mealamu, All Blacks vice-captain Conrad Smith and Ma'a Nonu, Smith was named as the vice-captain of the All Blacks by Head Coach Steve Hansen, with number 8 Kieran Read succeeding Richie McCaw as captain.\nSmith started his role as vice-captain on 11 June 2016 when the All Blacks beat Wales 39–21 in the first of the three-test series between the two countries. Smith was named as Man of the Match for the first test of the series and was not subbed off. Smith was shifted to right wing for the second test against Wales to accommodate for Israel Dagg who had returned from injury. The second test, a 36–22 win on 18 June 2016, was both Smith and Dagg's 50th test, with both players scoring tries. Smith was errorless in the second test with the exception of letting in Welsh lock Alun Wyn Jones in for a try, but did not win Man of the Match for the second week in a row, conceding the award to Dagg. Smith scored the opening try of the third test on 25 June 2016 and finished the series without being subbed off from the field, with the All Blacks thrashing Wales 46–6 to end the series.\nSmith was moved back for fullback for the second round of the 2016 Rugby Championship with Dagg as the right wing. This would become the re-established combination between the two players, with Smith cementing his spot as the All Blacks' first-choice fullback. Those two players ended up finishing as highest try scorers in the competition, both having scored 5 tries across the 6 matches of the competition each. Smith's most notable involvement in the competition was on 10 September 2016 where he scored two tries against Argentina during a 57–22 win. Smith was not subbed off during the Rugby Championship, but the performances of himself and Dagg were overshadowed by that of Beauden Barrett, the new first-choice first-five-eighth for the All Blacks, who scored 81 points in the competition.\nDuring the 2016 game vs Ireland in Dublin, Ben Smith provided cover at halfback while Aaron Smith was sin binned in the first half of the match. Smith was injured with a broken finger towards the end of the match, ending his international year as he was replaced by winger Waisake Naholo. Smith scored 8 tries throughout 2016, third-to-highest for the All Blacks behind new fly-half Beauden Barrett and Israel Dagg (the highest two international scorers for the year).\n2017.\nSmith became the 68th captain of the All Blacks in the absence of Kieran Read, on 16 June 2017, as he recovered from a concussion sustained during Super Rugby to lead the All Blacks out against Samoa at Eden Park, as a warm-up for the three-test series against the touring British &amp; Irish Lions team. Smith was subbed off for debutant Jordie Barrett in the 63rd minute, with lock Brodie Retallick taking over as captain for the rest of the test, which ended as a 78–0 win over Samoa.\nSmith was named to start at fullback in the first test of the historic series against the Lions on 24 June 2017, but only lasted 21 minutes before receiving what was at the time, thought to have been his third concussion sustained in the space of three months. Smith was replaced by veteran first-five Aaron Cruden, with Beauden Barrett shifting to fullback and Israel Dagg staying on the right wing as the All Blacks beat the Lions 30-15 without Smith on the field. This test would be Smith's only ever fixture against the Lions, with Waisake Naholo, Jordie Barrett and Julian Savea deputising for him in the second and third tests. Smith was sorely missed during the series, as the Lions broke a number of records to draw the series 1–1 with the All Blacks.\nAfter confirming that his vertigo was not a sign of concussion symptoms and instead caused by an inner ear infection, Smith announced that he would take a sabbatical from all forms of rugby following the second Bledisloe Cup test of 2017.\nSmith was named in the All Blacks squad for the 2017 Rugby Championship, but would begin his sabbatical after the second Bledisloe Cup test. Smith scored tries in both Bledisloe Cup tests against the Wallabies during the Rugby Championship, making yet another career milestone from the right wing (rookie Damian McKenzie was used at fullback), as Smith scored his 30th try for the All Blacks in the second test on 26 August 2017, which the All Blacks won 35–29. His sabbatical started following the conclusion of this test, with Beauden Barrett named as All Blacks vice-captain in Smith's absence.\n2018–2019.\nSmith made his return to international rugby after the 2018 Super Rugby season, scoring four tries from 12 tests in the 2018 season. Smith scored his 30th try for New Zealand on 9 June, in a 52–11 win over France, placing him amongst the all-time top try-scorers internationally.\nHaving played many 2018 tests on the right wing, Smith was again shifted back to his preferred position at fullback for New Zealand's opening test of 2019, a 20–16 win against Argentina, with Damian McKenzie not considered for selection due to injury. Smith started at fullback in the other two tests of the 2019 Rugby Championship, but Smith's poor performance in the first Bledisloe Cup test, saw New Zealand lose to Australia in a record 26–47 defeat, having already lost Scott Barrett to a red card.\nIn the second Bledisloe Cup test for 2019, Smith, as well as fellow poor-performing veterans, Owen Franks and Rieko Ioane, were axed from the match-day 23 altogether, with Beauden Barrett supplanting Smith as New Zealand's first-choice fullback, while rookie wingers, George Bridge and Sevu Reece, picked to start. Although Barrett had overtaken Smith in the pecking order, Smith was picked to start in his final home game in New Zealand, a 92–7 win over Tonga, scoring two tries in the game, having a far better performance.\nAlthough there were calls from the media for Smith to be dropped, he was named for his second World Cup, having been picked by All Black Head Coach, Steve Hansen, as one of 31 players in New Zealand's squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. He played in all three tests during the pool stages of the World Cup, two as a replacement off the bench and starting at fullback against Namibia in a 71–9 victory, scoring two tries in the process of that victory.\nSmith was not selected for the World Cup quarter-final win against Ireland, or the semi-final loss to England, having been surpassed by Sevu Reece and Beauden Barrett. With New Zealand's loss in the semi-final eliminating the team from the competition, Hansen chose to give Smith, as well as fellow retiring players, Kieran Read, Matt Todd, Sonny Bill Williams and Ryan Crotty their final test, in the Bronze Final against Wales. Smith had a standout performance, including two tries, against Wales, with New Zealand beating them 40–17, claiming third place in the 2019 World Cup.\n2022.\nBen made 2 appearances for an Otago regional touch team called Too Many Beers, in which he dominated proceedings and set up multiple tries which eventuated to 2 dominate wins. However, he did throw one “dusty nut” in which one particular team mate was highly disappointed in.\nManagerial career.\nSmith started his management career forking the Otago NPC Squad during the 2022 NPC season.\nFollowing his playing career retirement, he subsequently joined Super Rugby side Highlanders' management team for the 2023 season. The former club co-captain worked as an advisor, focusing on the club's back three's counterattack.\nOverseas club rugby.\nSmith played for the Old Colstonians club in Bristol, England in 2005 on a gap year after leaving King’s High School and for Pau in 2019/20.\nHe then played for the Japan Rugby League One team, Kobelco Kobe Steelers \nPersonal life.\nSmith married Katie Menzies in 2015. Their daughter was born that year and their second child, son Walter was born on 9 March 2017 while Smith was out injured with concussion."

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Adam Gilchrist",
        "text": "Adam Gilchrist is a retired international Australian batsman and wicketkeeper. He scored centuries (scores of 100 or more) 33 times in his career, in both Test and One Day International (ODI) matches. Describing his batting philosophy simply as \"just hit the ball\", he has been called \"one of the most destructive batsmen the sport has ever seen\".\nSelected for the Australian ODI side, Gilchrist made his debut in October 1996 against South Africa in the Titan Cup at Faridabad. His first century came in January 1998 against the same opponents, this time at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Opening the batting, he scored 100 runs from 104 deliveries, and led Australia to a seven-wicket victory. Gilchrist's third ODI century helped Australia to equal the world record for the highest ODI runchase, while his fourth, against Sri Lanka in 1999, helped Australia achieve the highest successful run chase in ODI history at the SCG at the time. His fifth ODI century, 154 against the same team later in the tournament, broke Dean Jones and Ricky Ponting's Australian record score of 145. Gilchrist's sixth ODI century, 128 from 98 deliveries against New Zealand, helped Australia on their way to their highest ever ODI total. He reached the milestone in 78 balls, equalling the Australian record of Allan Border for the fastest hundred in ODIs. As part of Gilchrist's eighth century, he and Ponting shared an Australian second-wicket record partnership of 225. He was named the Australian One-Day International Player of the Year in both 2003 and 2004. Gilchrist's highest score in ODI cricket is 172, achieved against Zimbabwe in January 2004. Gilchrist's century against the World XI came from 73 deliveries, breaking his own Australian record by five balls. He broke this mark again with his 14th century, reaching three figures in 67 balls. His penultimate ODI century was made in the 2007 Cricket World Cup final which also happened to be his only world cup century. Scoring 149 runs from 104 deliveries, including eight sixes and thirteen fours, Gilchrist made the highest score and quickest century in the final of the World Cup. Australia won every ODI match in which Gilchrist scored a century, and he retired with 16 to his name, scoring at a rate of more than one run per delivery in 13 of them.\nGilchrist made his Test debut against Pakistan in November 1999, and scored his first international century in the second match of the series. Scoring an unbeaten 149 in the fourth innings of the match, he led Australia to a four-wicket victory in Hobart. This was the third highest successful runchase in Test history and the highest on Australian soil. His second Test century helped to extend Australia's world record streak of consecutive Test wins to 16. This came after the Australians fell to 5/99 in reply to India's total of 171, before Gilchrist scored 122 from 112 deliveries, featuring in a 197-run partnership with Matthew Hayden in 32 overs. His highest Test score, 204 not out, was made against South Africa at the New Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg in February 2002. Featuring in a partnership of 317 with Damien Martyn, this was the fastest double century in Test history at the time, in terms of deliveries received. He followed this with 138 from 108 balls in the next match, and ended the three-Test series with 473 runs from 474 balls, at a batting average of 157.66. In the same year, he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. In 2006, he made the second-fastest century in Test history, hitting 100 from 57 balls, including three sixes in a single over against English bowler Monty Panesar. Usually batting at number seven in the Test side, Gilchrist scored centuries against all nine other Test nations. By the time of his retirement from international cricket in January 2008, he had scored 17 Test centuries.\nReferences.\nNotes\nWritten references"

They slowly worked their way towards the top of the SSC and NCAA Division II. \nIn 2007–08 season the women finished in second at the NCAA Division II Championship. They were 8 strokes behind conference mate Rollins College. They redeemed the tough defeat in 2008–09 season by winning the national championship, first for women's golf, by 15 strokes over Grand Valley State University. They would win the championship again in each of the next three years.\nFour golfers have won the NCAA Division II individual title: Sandra Changkija (2010), Taylor Collins (2011), Abbey Gittings (2012), and Olivia Gronborg (2023)."

The event was founded in 1931 as the New South Wales Close Championship, being restricted to residents of New South Wales, becoming the New South Wales Open Championship in 1958 when it was opened up to players from outside New South Wales. Norman Von Nida won the event six times, while Jim Ferrier and Frank Phillips won it five times with Greg Norman winning it four times.\nHistory.\nThe event was founded in 1931 as the New South Wales Close Championship, being restricted to residents of New South Wales. The first event was held at Manly Golf Club and, after 72 holes played over two days, resulted in a tie between three professionals Charlie Gray, Tom Howard and Sam Richardson. Gray won the title after a 36-hole playoff scoring 147 to Howard's 148. Richardson took 80 in the first round and didn't complete the 36 holes. Richardson won in 1932 but the remainder of the 1930s were dominated by Jim Ferrier who won five times and was runner-up twice between 1933 and 1939. Three times he won by 10 or more strokes.\nNorman Von Nida won in 1939 and then again from 1946 to 1948, to repeat Ferrier record of four successive wins. In 1951 a New South Wales Jubilee Open was organised, the state's first open championship, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Federation of Australia. The tournament was won by Dai Rees while Kel Nagle was runner-up and won the Close title. Von Nida won the Close championship again in 1953 and 1954, setting a record of six championship wins. The 1955 event clashed with the first Pelaco Tournament in Melbourne, an event which attracted all the leading New South Wales professionals.\nIn 1958 the championship was opened up to players from outside New South Wales, becoming the New South Wales Open Championship. Peter Thomson from Victoria won in 1961. Two amateur's won in the 1970s, Owen Beldham in 1972 and Tony Gresham in 1975, while American Ed Sneed won in 1973.\nThe tournament continued to be a major event in the 1980s. Greg Norman won three times in the decade and the 1989 event had prize money of A$300,000. The event then struggled for a number of years. The 1990 championship had prize money of A$50,000 and there was no event in 1991. In 1992 it had increased prize money of A$150,000 but there was again no event the following year. It returned in 1994 on the second-tier Foundation Tour with prize money of A$50,000 and was then not played again until 2002, when it returned with prize money of A$200,000.\nFrom 2003 to 2008 the event was part of the second-tier Von Nida Tour, while from 2009 to 2015 it was a Tier 2 event on the PGA Tour of Australasia schedule. In 2016 it became a Tier 1 event with prize money of A$400,000 compared to the A$110,000 in 2015."

The English club Derbyshire had been playing for seventy five years. It was their forty-second season in the County Championship and they won five matches and lost thirteen to finish fifteenth (two from bottom) in the County Championship.\n1946 season.\nOn the resumption of county cricket after the second world war in 1946 the main problem affecting Derbyshire was that of finding a regular captain. The convention was that the captain be an amateur and usually no one was available for more than one year. Gilbert Hodgkinson filled the role in 1946 and they made a poor re-entry to the County Championship . \nWisden Cricketers' Almanack (1947 edition), in its review of the 1946 season, remarked that \"the weather in 1946 might have been dreadful, but it didn't stop the crowds flocking to games\".\nDerbyshire began their season with a tour of Ireland. They played 26 games in the County Championship, and one match against the touring Indians. They won five matches altogether, and these wins came in a bright patch in the middle of the season. Denis Smith was top scorer and Cliff Gladwin took most wickets with 102. Pat Vaulkhard and Denis Smith's 4th wicket partnership of 328 against Nottinghamshire remains a record for the county.\nThe club retained a nucleus of pre-war players, and Pat Vaulkhard, a future captain, had previously played for Nottinghamshire. Alan Revill, Eric Marsh, John Eggar and Roy Genders all began their first-class career during the season, although some had already played for the club in miscellaneous matches during the war. England footballer Raich Carter turned out for Derbyshire at cricket. However newcomers Walter Fullwood and Jack Pearson did not play beyond the end of the season, and John Tomlinson only played one match for the club in 1946."

Éva Novák-Gerard's time of 2:54.0 min in 1952 at the same event was instead replaced as the current Olympic record.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nUrsula Happe's Olympic record was set using a technique of swimming long distances underwater during her run. This technique would later be disallowed by FINA in the late 1950s to ensure the majority of the race was swum on the surface."

Occasionally, setters record a triple-double, typically combining assists, digs, and either kills or blocks.\nA triple-double is a rare event, and indicates outstanding all-around individual performance."

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul—also known as a five–for or fifer—refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement; only five bowlers have taken more than 30 five-wicket hauls in their Test cricketing careers. Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan has the most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket, and also the second-highest number of five-wicket hauls in One Day Internationals (ODI). He did not take any five-wicket hauls in a Twenty20 International, where his best bowling figures were 3 wickets for 29 runs. One of the most experienced bowlers in international cricket, Muralitharan is the leading wicket taker in both Tests and ODIs. He was declared as the \"best bowler ever\" in Test cricket by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" in 2002, and the Sri Lankan team depended heavily on the off spinner for wickets.\nMuralitharan is well ahead of other bowlers by number of five-wicket hauls in Tests with 67 to his name; Australian cricketer Shane Warne ranks in second place with 37. Making his Test debut in 1992, Muralitharan took his first five-wicket haul a year later against South Africa. He performed this feat against every other Test playing nation. He went on to take ten or more wickets per match on 22 occasions—also a world record—while Shane Warne ranks second, having achieved this on 10 occasions. His career best is 9 wickets for 51 runs against Zimbabwe, which ranks as the world's fifth-best figures in an innings. He was most successful against Bangladesh and South Africa, with 11 five-wicket hauls against each team. Fourteen of Muralitharan's five-wicket hauls were taken at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground (SSC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka. He retired from Test cricket in July 2010, capturing his 67th and final five-wicket haul during his last match.\nIn ODIs, Muralitharan is ranked second in number of five-wicket hauls to Pakistani cricketer Waqar Younis. He played his first ODI in 1993, and took his first ODI five-wicket haul in 1998 against Pakistan. He repeated this performance against seven different opponents. His career best of 7 wickets for 30 runs is the fourth-best bowling figures in ODI history."

Thompson was selected for the British Isles team on its 1899 tour of Australia, but despite representing Great Britain, never played international rugby for England.\nRugby career.\nThompson first came to note as a rugby player through his selection in the 1899 British Isles team that toured Australia. He was uncapped before his selection, and did not have the distinction of an Oxford or Cambridge sporting 'Blue', a factor common to many of the touring party. The players were normally chosen at this early stage of touring parties, on sporting ability and just as importantly on the ability to take an unpaid five-month leave of absence.\nThompson was described by his tour captain Matthew Mullineux, as having 'a good kick' and having the ability to play at three-quarters and in the forwards. This would have made Thompson an all round player, because as a specialist full back, the only positions on the pitch excluded by his captain were at half-back. Thompson played in 13 games of the British Isles tour, including three Test matches against the Australian national team. Thompson was not selected for the first test in Sydney, with Mullineaux selecting Esmond Martelli at full back. The British team lost the opener, and Mullineux reacted by reshuffling his squad, including dropping himself from future Test games, and also selecting Thompson rather than Martelli. Mullineux's tactics resulted in the British Isles winning the remaining three Tests, and Thompson finishing the tour with three international wins.\nWhen selected for the British Isles, Thompson is listed as representing Lancashire, but in the 1900/01 season he is listed as playing for northern team, Manchester Rugby Club. While at Manchester, he was approached by the Barbarians, an invitational touring team that played within Britain. Thompson accepted the invitation becoming one of the earliest members of the club."

Nations had been limited to three swimmers each since the 1924 Games. The event was won by Jon Henricks of Australia, the nation's first medal in the event. Australia would win a second 0.4 seconds later (John Devitt's silver) and a third 0.9 seconds after that (Gary Chapman's bronze), sweeping the podium—the first sweep in the men's 100 metre freestyle since the United States did it in 1920 and 1924, and the first sweep of any event by Australian competitors. This year, the Americans finished fourth through sixth. It was the first time since 1924 that Japan had competed (that is, excluding 1948) but not medaled.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the eight finalists from the 1952 Games returned: silver medalist Hiroshi Suzuki of Japan and seventh-place finisher Aldo Eminente of France. The favorite in 1956 was Jon Henricks of Australia, a converted distance swimmer who had begun racing sprints in 1953.\nColombia and Indonesia each made their debut in the event; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. The United States made its 12th appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952 (though with only 2 semifinals instead of 3). A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 5 heats of 6 or 7 swimmers each. The top 16 swimmers advanced to the semifinals. There were 2 semifinals of 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events).

        "title": "Lansdown Cricket Club",
        "text": "Lansdown Cricket Club, formed in 1825, is recognised as the earliest official organised cricket club in Somerset. Originally based in Lansdown, since 1869 the club has been based at Combe Park, Bath, adjacent to the Royal United Hospital.\nFoundation.\nCricket was relatively slow to come to Somerset, but by the early 19th century it was being played in a haphazard fashion, mainly on gentlemen's country-house grounds. Lansdown was preceded by an up-market Bath club that played from about 1817–1824, and many of that club's enthusiasts went on to become part of Lansdown. Formed in 1825, Lansdown played originally at a ground known either as \"Cricket Down\" or as the \"Racecourse ground\" on the summit of the hill called Lansdown to the north of Bath: the ground was not at the site of the current Bath Racecourse but at a little-used racecourse nearer the city, adjacent to Beckford's Tower.\nAround 1850, Lansdown moved to Captain Thornhill's Sydenham Field, which was on the south bank of the river Avon in the area later built on by the Midland Railway line that ran into Bath Green Park railway station.\nIn these early years, arranging matches was a problem as there was a lack of other established clubs of good reputation to play. Trips to Devon, to take on Sidmouth and Teignmouth, and up to Bristol to play Clifton were much the extent of their calendar. During this time, selection was based as much on social status as on talent, and the club was even dubbed by someone as 'the MCC of the West'.\nEarly recognition.\nAs the years passed, Lansdown's reputation grew, and their opposition similarly grew in reputation, as they entertained Oxford University and the MCC. In 1852, they played host at Sydenham Field to an All-England Eleven, Lansdown fielded 22 men and, after three days, the match finished a draw. W. G. Grace made his debut for Lansdown on 5 July 1861, just short of his thirteenth birthday, and played two matches during that month. A few years later, in 1865 when Lansdown entertained United England Eleven, their side contained three of the Grace brothers, with E.M. and Henry Grace also playing. Between the three of them, they took all of the England side's wickets in the match as Lansdown won by an innings and 113 runs. In 1869, the club moved to Combe Park, where it has played ever since.\nNurturing ground.\nLansdown has had a number of talented professionals through the years. The Somerset opener Tom Young spent some time at the club in 1910, and the brothers Jack and Frank Lee played for the club while qualifying for Somerset in the 1920s. In the postwar years, the mainstay of the batting for many years was Les Angell, whose prolific scoring for Lansdown masked a more modest record in first-class cricket for Somerset. Almost overlapping with Angell, in 1973, Viv Richards similarly turned out for the side while he served his qualification period for Somerset. During his time at the club he not only entertained the crowd with his runs, but also cut the grass for the club."

        "text": "The Hospital of St. Cross is a National Health Service hospital on Barby Road, in Rugby, Warwickshire, England, managed by the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust. It is on the south edge of Rugby above a steep slope running down to the Sow Brook valley.\nHistory.\nThe hospital was founded by Richard Henry Wood DL, a wealthy stockbroker who was originally from Manchester, but who had lived in Rugby for 21 years, and his wife, Elizabeth Wood (née Hatton) to replace an earlier nursing home in Castle Street, which had opened in 1869, and was no-longer adequate for the town's needs. The Woods' donated a plot of land off Barby Road and a donation of a million pounds to build the hospital. Named after the Hospital of St Cross in Winchester, it was designed by Henry Wilson, of Gray's Inn Square, and opened in July 1884. When opened it had three nurses, four support staff, and 31 beds. The hospital has undergone numerous extensions since, with many new buildings added. The original building is still extant. \nThe Victoria Diamond Jubilee Wing was opened by the founder in July 1899, the children's wing was opened by Princess Henry of Battenburg in October 1907 and a new out-patient department was opened by the Duchess of York in April 1929. In 1932 a sun pavilion was added on the south side, when fresh air was viewed as an effective treatment. \nIt joined the National Health Service in 1948. In the early-1990s, St Cross was further enlarged, after the decision was taken to close St Luke's Hospital in Rugby, and move all of its services to St Cross, this was completed in 1993. A new Diamond Jubilee rehabilitation centre was opened by Princess Alexandra of Kent in April 2014. 2021 saw the opening of The Maple Unit, a £1 million purpose-built Haematology and Oncology centre.\nNotable staff.\nBetween 1896 and 1925 all three matrons trained at The London Hospital under Eva Luckes.\nFacilities.\nThe hospital has 110 beds and six operating theatres, which specialise in elective surgery. It has an urgent treatment centre for minor injuries and illnesses, which is open every day, 24 hours a day, but does not have a full Accident and Emergency department, the nearest of which is based at University Hospital Coventry. It has a blood taking unit. It also provides rehabilitation, outpatient and screening services. A more extensive range of medical services are provided at the University Hospital Coventry which is the principal hospital serving the Coventry and Rugby area.\nIn 1997, the hospital's Accident and Emergency department was downgraded to a minor injuries unit; there has been a campaign locally to restore full A&amp;E services to the hospital, citing a growing local population, and the long journey to the nearest A&amp;E department in Coventry, some away.\nRating.\nIn 2020, the Care Quality Commission rated the hospital as \"good\" overall.\nMyton Hospice.\nSharing the site of St Cross Hospital is Rugby Myton Hospice which was opened in 2002. This is not an NHS facility, but is funded largely by charitable donations."

        "text": "George Walter Ball (September 12, 1878 – December 15, 1946) was an American baseball pitcher in the Negro leagues. Born in Detroit, Michigan, from 1893 he played ten years as the only black player on minor white teams in Minnesota and North Dakota. For more than a decade beginning 1903, he played for major teams, mainly in the Chicago region. Sources say he was given the nickname \"The Georgia Rabbit\" and \"Diamond.\"\nCareer.\nHe began his baseball career in 1893 in St. Paul, Minnesota playing for the Young Cyclones team. He also played briefly with the Osceola team until 1899, when he went to Grand Forks, North Dakota where he played until the end of the 1900 season. In the first season, Ball won 25 out of 28 games, and helped the team win the state baseball championship of North Dakota.\nBall played with the Lakota, North Dakota team for the first part of the 1901 season. He captained the York, North Dakota baseball team the last half of the season and finished the season there.\nIn 1902 he played on the St. Cloud baseball team, helping them win the championship of eastern Minnesota. He wintered in Grand Forks, North Dakota and was signed by Frank Leland to play for his Chicago Union Giants in 1903. It was the first colored baseball team Ball had ever played for, and until then he had always been the only black player on white teams.\nAfter the 1903 season with the Chicago Union Giants, Ball was signed and played for the Cuban X-Giants for the 1904 season, playing with Mike Moore, Grant Johnson, Harry Buckner, Dan McClellan, and Big Bill Smith.\nIn 1905 Ball played the first half of the season for the Brooklyn Royal Giants. During the last half of the season, he was back playing for the Chicago Union Giants, reportedly winning 48 straight games.\nIn 1906 Ball went to New York to play a season with the Quaker Giants, but the team folded by July 1 of that year. He came back to Chicago and finished the year with the Leland Giants.\nWorking with Reid and Hirshfield, Ball organized and managed the St. Paul Gophers in 1907. He even played on the team part of the season, but didn't finish the season there and moved back to Chicago to finish the year with the Leland Giants.\nIn 1908 Ball went back to Minneapolis, Minnesota and played for the Keystones. However, Frank Leland got Ball released from his contract, and he returned to Chicago to finish the season. He played winter ball in 1908-1909 for the Fe club of Havana, Cuba, winning 12 out of 15 games. He prevented the Almendares from winning the pennant which they had won five years in a row. When the winter season closed on March 31, 1909, he joined the Lelands at spring training in Memphis, Tennessee in April and toured the south, never losing a game in Spring Training.\nBall opened the 1909 season with the Leland Giants, losing only one out of 25 league games that year.\nSportswriter and fellow player Jimmy Smith put Ball on his 1909 \"All American Team.\"\nHe was still pitching for the Chicago Giants into his 40s when the Negro National League formed in 1920 and 1921.\nDeath and legacy.\nBall died in Chicago. He is buried at the Lincoln Cemetery at Blue Island, Illinois.\nSix years after his death, Ball received votes listing him on the 1952 \"Pittsburgh Courier\" player-voted poll of the Negro leagues' best players ever.\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball Stats and Seamheads "

        "text": "William Walker Cash (February 21, 1919 – September 12, 2011), nicknamed \"Ready\", was an American baseball player who became an all-star catcher in the Negro leagues. He batted and threw right-handed. Cash earned his nickname when he was benched and protested to a team manager, \"When I put on the uniform, I'm ready to play\".\nCash spent his entire Negro league career with the Philadelphia Stars. He also played minor league baseball for the Chicago White Sox's farm teams and teams in Mexico, Canada, and Venezuela (Guerilus). After his retirement from baseball, Cash was an active member of the Philadelphia community\nEarly life.\nCash was born to Arthur \"Buster\" Cash and Lela Lloyd Cash in 1919. He was born in Round Oak, Georgia. The family moved to an area of Philadelphia called Eastwick-Elmwood in 1924. his family lived in the Meadows area near the Philadelphia International Airport. Cash graduated from Overbrook High School in Philadelphia in 1939. At Overbrook, Cash was the only black player on the baseball and he quit the squad to play semi-pro ball elsewhere.\nCash spent four years playing for semi-pro teams in Philadelphia, including the Camden Giants, the Black Meteors, and the Philadelphia Daisies (\"Negro Leagues Baseball Museum\"). Webster McDonald, manager of the Daisies, introduced Cash to Goose Curry, manager of the Philadelphia Stars, when he felt that Cash was ready to move up (\"Negro Leagues Baseball Museum\"). Curry ended up signing Cash to play for him.\nNegro league career.\nCash began to play for the Philadelphia Stars in 1943. His batting average coming out of the semi-pros was .321, but he only batted .258 during his rookie season in the Negro league. His reputation was tarnished on Opening Day in 1946 during an argument with an umpire. In the skirmish, the umpire fell and while he was on his hands and knees, an angry Goose Curry, stormed the field and kicked him. Cash was suspended for three days and fined $25 for his role in the incident.\nCash was slated to catch for Satchel Paige's barnstorming All-Star team in 1946, but could not due to a broken thumb. He did participate in the East-West All-Star games of 1948 and 1949. Cash began the 1948 game as a substitute, but caught the entire game in 1949 in which he called the pitches as the East held a two-hit shutout of the West All-Stars.\nMinor league career.\nCash's Negro league career came to an end in 1950 when he left the Stars only a few games into the season to join the Mexico City Red Devils. In Mexico, he batted .311, higher than any year he played with the Stars, and registered 15 home runs. Later, Cash went on to play for the Granby Red Sox in the Provincial League of Canada, batting .296 with 16 home runs.\nCash signed with Chicago White Sox in 1952, hoping to play for their major league team, but was relegated to their farm teams instead. Cash claimed that the White Sox organization promised him a Class A position, but he was given a Class B position instead. He split the season with the Superior Blues in Superior, Wisconsin, (where he spent less than 10 games) and the Waterloo White Hawks in Waterloo, Iowa. He suffered more injuries throughout the 1952 season, battling bursitis in his shoulder and a broken leg.\nCash hit .347, his highest batting average yet, with the Brandon Braves in 1953. For the next three years he played in the Dominican Republic for the Licey Tigers. Cash ended his baseball career in Bismarck, North Dakota, playing alongside other Negro league greats such as Ray Dandridge and Art Pennington. During his last season, he had a career-high batting average of .369.\nPersonal life.\nCash met and fell in love with Sadie Bell Brooks in 1940. The couple married on September 7, 1940. They also had three children, William W. Cash Jr., Janet Cash, and Michael Cash. They were married for 63 years. His family was a great source of his pride.\nAfter Cash retired from baseball in 1955, he took a job at Westinghouse Electric, where he worked as a machinist for 30 years. It was a job that he enjoyed because he was training to become a machinist before he started to play baseball. He retired from Westinghouse in 1985.\nCash was also very active in his local community, particularly with a dedication to helping the youth of Philadelphia. He was the founder of the Cobbs Creek Little League Association and vice president of the Foundation for Juvenile Decency. In addition to those positions, he also founded the Parkway Little League and served on the board of directors for the Negro League Baseball Players Association. He often spoke at schools, churches, and other venues about his life as a baseball player and what hurdles African Americans must overcome in America (Guerilus). Cash also contributed to the foundation of a group called Concerned Black Men who worked with the needy children of Philadelphia (\"Sports Reference LLC\").\nCash also held several positions as a clergyman in Philadelphia. He was a deacon at the Calvary Baptist Church in Philadelphia and later became a senior deacon at the First African Baptist Church in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, where he served for 30 years (Guerilus).\nAwards and recognition.\nCash was inducted into the National Negro League Baseball Museum of History in 1981 (Hunt). He and other Negro league veterans were honored by President Bill Clinton at the White House in 1994 (Hunt). He was also honored by the City of Philadelphia, the National Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, New York and the African American Museum in Philadelphia.\nCash also made the 2006 Special Committee on the Negro league's preliminary ballot (\"Sports Reference LLC)\". He and Philadelphia Stars teammate Stanley Glenn were honored by the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park on June 5, 2008, where they were both presented with Phillies jerseys (Hunt). Cash resides in the Douglas, Cheyney University, and Delaware County Halls of Fame (\"Negro Leagues Baseball Museum\").\nCash died on September 12, 2011, in Philadelphia, at the age of 92.\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball stats and Seamheads"

        "text": "The men's horizontal bar competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. It was held on 5, 7, and 10 September at the Baths of Caracalla. There were 130 competitors from 28 nations, with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 2 gymnasts. The event was won by Takashi Ono of Japan, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's parallel bars (tying the United States for second-most all-time). Masao Takemoto gave Japan a second medal with his silver. Ono and Takemoto were the third and fourth men to win multiple medals in the parallel bars; Ono was the first to win two gold medals in the event. Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union took bronze.\nThe 1960 gymnastics competitions introduced apparatus finals, with the all-around competition serving as a qualifying round for the parallel bars final.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Seven of the top 12 (including ties for 10th) gymnasts from 1956 returned: gold medalist Takashi Ono of Japan, silver medalist Yury Titov of the Soviet Union, bronze medalist Masao Takemoto of Japan, seventh-place finisher Jack Beckner of the United States, eighth-place finisher Albert Azaryan of the Soviet Union, ninth-place finisher Ferdinand Daniš of Czechoslovakia, and tenth-place finisher Stoyan Stoyanov of Bulgaria. Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union was the reigning (1958) world champion, with Azaryan second, Titov and Takemoto tied for third, and Ono sixth.\nMorocco and South Korea each made their debut in the men's parallel bars; the short-lived United Arab Republic made its only appearance. The United States made its ninth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics all-around events continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to two individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score.\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the new apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 130th. For the apparatus finals, the all-around score for that apparatus was multiplied by one-half then added to the final round exercise score to give a final total.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, with the final total apparatus score from 0 to 20."

        "text": "The Canadian Team Handball Federation, CTHF, is the governing body of team handball in Canada. It was founded in 1962 and joined the International Handball Federation the same year.\nThe CTHF is a member of the North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation and the Commonwealth Handball Association. The CTHF is made up of the following voting member provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.\nThe CTHF sanctions three national tournaments each year for three categories, senior (22 and over), junior (21 and under), and juvenile (19 and under) both men and women subcategories exist within each age category. The tournaments are hosted and organized by one of the member provinces. The winner of the tournament is awarded the title of National Champions for the year until the tournament is held again.\nNational Teams.\nThe Canada men's and Women's senior national handball team competes under Pan-American Team Handball Federation (PATHF) Both teams have never qualified for their respective IHF World championships and Olympic Games. The men's team, led by Patrick Combs, have competed in the Pan American games six times and the woman, led by Anne Hankins, have competed five times since Handball was introduced at the 1987 Pan am games in Indianapolis. The Men's team best finish is fourth in 1987 and 1991. The women's team best finish has been second three times in 1987, 1995 and 1999. There was no competition held for women in the 1991 edition of the tournament. Both teams are trying to qualify for the 2019 edition in Lima, Peru. Canada's men's team has won one silver and two bronze at the Pan American Men's Handball Championship.\nTournaments Hosted.\nCanada has hosted the 1999 Pan Am Games handball tournament in Winnipeg, Manitoba and the 2015 Pan Am Games handball tournament in Toronto, Ontario. These events were hosted by the Canadian Olympic Committee not by the Canadian Team Handball Federation. However Canada Handball did get to attend because of automatic qualification."

        "text": "Pyruvate cycling commonly refers to an intracellular loop of spatial movements and chemical transformations involving pyruvate. Spatial movements occur between mitochondria and cytosol and chemical transformations create various Krebs cycle intermediates. In all variants, pyruvate is imported into the mitochondrion for processing through part of the Krebs cycle. In addition to pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate may also be imported. At various points, the intermediate product is exported to the cytosol for additional transformations and then re-imported. Three specific pyruvate cycles are generally considered, each named for the principal molecule exported from the mitochondrion: malate, citrate, and isocitrate. Other variants may exist, such as dissipative or \"futile\" pyruvate cycles.\nThis cycle is usually studied in relation to Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion ( or GSIS ) and there is thought to be a relationship between the insulin response and NADPH produced from this cycle but the specifics are not clear and particular confusion exists about the role of malic enzymes. It has been observed in various cell types including islet cells.\nThe pyruvate-malate cycle was described in liver and kidney preparations as early as 1971."

        "title": "Cycling in Los Angeles",
        "text": "Cycling in Los Angeles accounts for less than one percent (0.6%) of all work commutes. Because of the mild climate, there is little need to carry the variety of clothing that cyclists require in other less temperate climates.\nHistory.\nOne of the world's earliest examples of a segregated cycle facility was the nine-mile dedicated Cycle-Way built in 1897 to connect Pasadena to Los Angeles. Its right-of-way followed the stream bed of the Arroyo Seco and required 1,250,000 board feet (2,950 m3) of pine to construct. The roundtrip toll was 15¢ and it was lit with electric lights along its entire length. The route did not succeed, and the right-of-way later became the route for the Arroyo Seco Parkway, an automobile freeway opened in 1940.\nLos Angeles' cycling network.\n, there were more than of bike lanes and paths in the Los Angeles bike path network, such as the Los Angeles River bicycle path, which runs from Burbank to Cypress Park and from Maywood to Long Beach, with a gap of approximately 8 miles through Downtown Los Angeles and adjacent industrial zones separating the two sections. Metro aims to join the two sections by the year 2027 via the LA River Path Project\nOn September 9, 2011, city councilman Ed Reyes unveiled a new 2.2-mile bike lane stretching along 7th Street from Catalina Avenue in Koreatown to Figueroa Street downtown.\nCycling rules and regulations.\nRoad rules.\nCyclists may travel either in the street or on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk they must behave so as not to cause danger to pedestrians (which is an arbitrary judgment that seems to translate into traveling at walking pace). Moreover, in some of the cities within the greater Los Angeles region, it is illegal to cycle on the sidewalk. Cyclists in general should follow the same traffic rules and behavior as motorized vehicles. It is legal for a cyclist to \"take a lane\" within the State of California, and in the case of narrow-width lanes it is advisable to do so.\nIt is not required to wear a helmet unless the rider is under the age of 18 years. A driver's license is also not required for a cyclist. The bicycle relevant sections of the California Vehicle Code indicate that a cyclist may ride out from the right-hand curb in order to avoid obstacles. This explicit provision, combined with the California Driver's Handbook (which indicates that passing vehicles must ensure minimum safe passing distance), means that certain lanes which are not wide enough for a bicycle and a passing automobile should be occupied by the bicycle until it is safe for the cyclist to pull in to the right and signal the automobile to overtake if there is no other safe-passing lane available for the automobile.\nOn public transport.\nBoth Metro Bus and Metro Rail services are bicycle accessible. All Metro buses have two bicycle racks at the front of the bus, except for the Orange Line, which has three bicycle racks. Metro Rail allows bicycles on trains at all times.\nBicycles are allowed on the Metrolink commuter rail system, which connects the core of the city to the suburbs. There is storage for two bicycles at the rear of each carriage. The mechanism consists of two pairs of velcro straps per bicycle, which fasten the front and rear wheels to supports. A Metrolink ticket is also valid for any Metro bus, subway, or light rail train in Los Angeles County, and most of the buses in the surrounding communities."

        "title": "1934 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 12",
        "text": "The 1934 Tour de France was the 28th edition of Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Tour began in Paris on 3 July and Stage 12 occurred on 16 July with a flat stage to Marseille. The race finished in Paris on 29 July.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage of the 1934 Tour de France was run on a very hot day, which handicapped the Belgian and North-French cyclists, who were not as used to the heat as the cyclists from Spain, Italy and Southern France. Early in the stage, Georges Speicher tried to escape, but he was caught back by the Italian cyclists. Later, Roger Lapébie and Giovanni Cazzulani escaped, and they created a gap of one minute, but the peloton increased speed and managed to get back to them. After the race passed Beauvais, the cyclists increased their speed further. A group escaped, including Spanish cyclists Mariano Cañardo and Luciano Montero, but that escape was also not successful. Before the hills of Doulens, the peloton regrouped. At that moment, a new escape was started by Félicien Vervaecke, Adriano Vignoli and Vasco Bergamaschi. The French team was weakened at that moment: Francis Pélissier had spent too much energy and was delayed, and Maurice Archambaud suffered from the heat, although he did recuperate and managed to get back to the leading riders. Speicher, who had been without teammates, had been helped by Le Goff, who rode as an individual.\nAfter the hills of Doulens, a head group of eight cyclists was formed. Some cyclists got back to the head group, but two kilometres from the end, it was back again to a group of eight cyclists, and the winner was decided by a sprint, won by Georges Speicher.\nStage 2.\nThe second stage, run in Northern France in colder weather than the first stage, was through to end up in a victory for a Belgian cyclist. They could not live up to this expectation however, and the Italian team proved stronger. Although Raffaele di Paco had to give up during this stage, the other Italian cyclists were constantly attacking. Speicher, the leader of the general classification, could not keep up, and halfway the stage was already more than three minutes behind. The Italian cyclists kept the speed up, and in the end of the stage, a group of eleven cyclists was more than fifteen minutes ahead of the next group, including Georges Speicher, Roger Lapébie, Charles Pélissier and Maurice Archambaud, four important cyclists of the French team. The French team still had René Le Grevès, Antonin Magne and Raymond Louviot in the first group. Le Grevès won the sprint for the stage victory, and Magne took over the lead in the general classification.\nStage 3.\nIn the third stage, the cyclists were reserving energy for the fourth stage, in which the first mountain would show up. The riders started without Belgian cyclist Gaston Rebry; he had finished in the second stage outside of the time limit, together with Spaniard Luciano Montero, and although the tour direction allowed them to start again in the third stage, Rebry did not take that chance. The peloton kept together for a long time, and started to race only after they had passed Longuyon. The Belgian Frans Dictus tried to escape, but the French cyclists Louviot and Lapebie reeled him back in. Romain Maes tried to get away a few times, but finally a group of fifteen cyclists was formed, who arrived in Metz first, followed by the other important cyclists in less than one minute. The sprint was won by Lapébie. After the stage, the Belgian Romain Maes, who finished in second place, complained about the other Belgian cyclists, saying that they were more concerned about their own standings than about their teammates, and that they did not race as a team.\nStage 4.\nIn the fourth stage, the first mountain counted towards the mountains classification was climbed, the Ballon d'Alsace. Initially after the race started, German Buse escaped, but he was quickly caught back, and nothing happened for a long time, and the pelotón rode as if they were a group of tourists. Around Remiremont, where the landscape became more mountainous, the first real escape took place, with the French cyclist Le Grevès and the Belgian Félicien Vervaecke. Many cyclists suffered on the hills, and an autobus was quickly formed. When the Ballon d'Ascace was to be climbed, Le Grevès and Vervaecke were still leading the race. After Le Grevès could not keep up with Vervaecke anymore, Vervaecke went solo. Vervaecke reached the top first, and collected 10 points for the mountains classification, and also two minutes bonification time for the general classification. The next cyclist was Vicente Trueba, 1'43\" behind.\nVervaecke kept his lead, descending the Ballon d'Alsace. Behind him, the cyclists regrouped, and the leader of the general classification, Magne, was in this group. This group worked together to get Vervaecke back. Four kilometres from the finish, Vervaecke had an advantage of 800 metres, but with only 1500 metres to go, Vervaecke fell down and was captured by the pursuing group. In the sprint, Lapébie took the victory, the fourth French victory in four days. Magne, who finished in the lead group, kept leading the general classification, and extended his margin to 6'40\". The team classification was still led by the French team, and Vervaecke became the first leader of the mountains classification.\nStage 5.\nDirectly after the start of the fifth stage, German Buse tried to escape, just as he had tried the day before. He was joined by Cazzulani, and they created a gap of 300 metres, but were quickly reeled in the peloton. The peloton rode fast, as they ascended the first hill of the day, the Saint-Hyppolyte (not counting towards the mountains classification). Some cyclists could not keep up with on the way up, but many of them were able to regroup on the descent. It was extremely hot, so the main group slowed down, and everybody was able to regroup. Nobody escaped on the Savin, a hill of 900 metres, and on the Faucille, 1350 metres high but with smooth slopes, also nobody escaped. Some cyclists fell out at the back, and when the race reached Geneva, the group consisted of about 20 cyclists. Swiss riders Erne, Büchi and Stettler were allowed to enter Geneva first, and they were cheered by the Swiss spectators. The group reached Evian together, and in the sprint, French cyclists Le Grevès and Speicher crossed the line together. The tour direction could not decide who was the winner, so they were both declared winner of the stage.\nThe day after the fifth stage was a rest day.\nStage 6.\nEarly in the sixth stage, the Aravis was climbed, the second mountain that counted towards the mountains classification. Vervaecke improved his lead in that classification by reaching the top first. The stage was won by Georges Speicher, who won the sprint of a lead group that included all the favourites.\nStage 7.\nIn the seventh stage, the cyclists remained together in the first half. When the cyclists were given their food, a group of four cyclists (Louviot, Morelli, Salazard and Speicher) quickly got theirs, and escaped from the peloton. On the foot of the Telegraph, they were one minute ahead of the next followers, Ezquerra and Vignoli. When Louviot and Salazard got off their bicycles to change gears, Morelli and Speicher continued. Shortly after, Speicher also stopped to change gears, and Morelli went through alone, but he quickly found out that this was a mistake. The four cyclists were then all overtaken by Ezquerra and Vietto, who are duelling to reach the top first. Ezquerra then escaped from Vietto, and reached the top 1 minute and 12 seconds before Vietto. As the cyclists descended the mountain, Vietto was able to get back to Ezquerra. Together they reached the Galibier, and climbed together.\nVietto and Ezquerra were being followed by a group led by Trueba. Magne, who was 6 minutes ahead of Ezquerra in the general classification, was also in that group, trailing by 3 minutes.\nClose to the top of the Galibier, Vietto was dropped by Ezquerra, who reached the top first. For this, Ezquerra received a prize of 5000 francs. Because Vervaecke reached the top in eighth place, Ezquerra took over the leading position in the mountains classification. On the way down from the Galibier, Vietto again caught Ezquerra, and together they rode towards the Col de Lautarast. This time, Vietto won the climbing duel, and he had a margin of 40 seconds to Ezquerra. At that moment, Antonin Magne was more than six minutes behind. With more than 70 km to go, Vietto tried to escape definitively. He gradually built up his lead, and 40 km before the finish, he was leading by about 6 minutes on a group that formed in the plain region, and had reached Ezquerra. But then, Vietto got tired, and his lead went down to 3 minutes when he entered Grenoble. He subsequently won the stage, and Magne, who finished in the next group, maintained the lead in the general classification.\nThe Germans Wolke and Risch, who had finished outside the time limit, were allowed to start the next stage.\nStage 8.\nThe eighth stage, from Grenoble to Gap, was relatively short, with 102 km. It contained one mountain that counted towards the mountains classification, the Col de Laffrey. This mountain showed up early in the stage. After 17 km of flat land, which were done at low speed, the climb started. Trueba led the climb, followed by Vervaecke, Ezquerra and Morelli. Halfway the climb, Vervaecke had to slow down, but Trueba kept his high speed. He reached the top first, with 1'40\" advantage over Ezquerra. Morelli was a few seconds behind Ezquerra, and a group with Magne followed at 2'40\". \nOn the way down, the positions changed. Trueba was a bad descender, and could not keep the leading position. Ezquerra, Magne and Martano took the lead, followed by Lapébie, Vervaecke, Geyer, Vietto, Trueba and Morelli. The cyclist then started the climb to the Col Bayard. Then, a new leading group was formed by Molinar, Magne, Martano, Vietto and Vervaecke. Molinar escaped on the way down from the Col Bayard, and sped away with high speed. Magne and Martano tried to follow him, and overtook Molinar. Martano dared to take more risks, and got away from Magne and Molinar. Martano rode solo to the finish, when, at high speed, Martano fell down. He quickly got up, and was able to keep a slight gap, and so won the stage.\nStage 9.\nThe first kilometres of the ninth stage were done slowly, as the cyclists were saving their energy for the mountains of the stage. After 19 km, the Col de Var showed up, and the main contenders for the general classification showed up at the head of the peloton, increasing the speed. Magne, the leader, kept close eyes on Martano, his closest competitor. After 4 km of climbing, Vietto escaped. He was closely followed by Vervaecke and Ezquerra.\nVietto reached the top first, followed by Ezquerra, and Treuba, who had overtaken Vervaecke on the climb. Magne had stayed together with Martano.\nOn the way down, Vietto kept a high speed, because he was determined to start the next climb alone. He managed to do that, and reached the Barcelonette more than six minutes before the next group, consisting of Ezquerra, Trueba, Vervaecke, Martano, Magne, Morelli, Canardo and Gestri. Vietto had set such a high pace that most of the cyclists were already 20 minutes behind at that point. At the summit of the next mountain, the Col de Allos, Vietto was still six minutes ahead. From then on, it was mainly downhill, and although Vietto lost time, he reached the finish first, with a margin of 2'44\" on Molinar and Trueba. Magne finished 6'28\" behind Vietto, but he had stayed close to Martano during the entire stage, and so kept his lead in the general classification.\nStage 10.\nIn the first kilometres of the tenth stage, Speicher escaped. He created a gap of 300 metres. Belgian Romain Maes fell against a telegraph post. Morelli and Wauters, also fell down, but they quickly got back to the group, while Maes lay in the ground. The car of tour director Jacques Goddet that passed Maes, immediately stopped to help Maes, who had a gaping wound in his forehead. Maes had to stop the race.\nSpeicher was caught back on the Leques. Shortly after, he tried to escape again, together with Lapébie. They were chased and captured by a group consisting of Magne, Martano, Vietto, Trueba, Calezzini and Vervaecke. On the way down, more cyclists join this group. On the next col, the Luen, Vervaecke escaped, trying to win time on Morelli, for the position of best independent rider. He managed to get 2 minutes away, but on the descent of the Seranon he was captured back. At that point, 40 cyclists were together. The speed was kept high by the sprinters, and nobody got away. Because of the high speed, the group broke, and the first group of 20 cyclists sprinted for the victory. René Le Grevès won the stage, ahead of Roger Lapébie.\nThe day after the tenth stage, the peloton had a rest day.\nStage 11.\nThe eleventh stage contained two mountains that counted towards the mountains classification, the Braus and La Turbie. Directly after the start of the stage, it started to rain. Early in the race, in the climb of the Braus, Vietto escaped. He reached the top 30 seconds before Ezquerra. Vietto stayed alone for a long time, but he was caught by Martano, second placed in the general classification, got away from Magne, the leader of the general classification. Martano and Vietto stayed away, and at the finish line had a margin of 3'23\" over Magne. Vietto won the sprint for the stage victory, and Martano reduced the gap in the general classification to 2'05.\nStage 12.\nThe twelfth stage was won by Roger Lapébie, but Magne remained leader of the general classification."

They finished the season 10–20, 6–10 in MAC play and lost in the first round of the 2010 MAC men's basketball tournament.\nBefore the season.\nRoster changes.\nThe Huskies only lost one senior from last year's team. That player, Sean Smith, started in 29 of Northern Illinois' 30 games for that season (only one player had started all 30). He contributed an average 8.4 points per game. However, Northern Illinois has recruited two newcomers for their team. Xavier Silas, a transfer from Colorado, who made his Northern Illinois day-view after sitting out one year because of NCAA transfer rules. Another newcomer will be Keith Smith, who redshirted his first season.\nThe Huskies were predicted to finish 2nd in the MAC West.\nDuring the season.\nNorthern Illinois had a rough start to its 2009-10 campaign. In the opening loss to Northwestern, Xavier Silas went down with a fracture on his shooting hand, an injury that would sideline him for one month. The loss was a tough blow for NIU, because Silas was expected to be a key contributor to the team after averaging double figures in scoring during his two years at Colorado.\nWithout Silas, the Huskies struggled through the non-conference schedule. They were 1-5 when Silas made his come back against Minnesota. In his first two games back, Silas shot the ball poorly, showing clear signs of being rusty after sitting out for a whole month. The Huskies lost both games and dropped to 1-7.\nTough loss to #18 Temple.\nWith Silas back in form after his injury, Northern beat Maryland Eastern Shore behind his 19 points. After winning only their second game of the season, NIU prepared to face their first ranked opponent at home in a long time. The game was expected to be a blowout, but the Huskies hung tough for most of the game, but in the end Temple was just too much, winning 70-60.\n6-game winning streak.\nAfter losing to ranked Temple, Northern would go on to win their next 6 games, including their first 4 conference games. The 4-0 start in conference play marked the best start in school history.\nDuring the 6-game winning streak, Silas averaged 22 points per contest.\n6-game losing streak.\nNorthern Illinois traveled to Central Michigan to play a veteran Chippewa squad. After battling for most of the game, the Huskies fell short, losing 81-75 and snapping their winning streak.\nCrossover play began against the East Division, widely considered the best of the MAC divisions. The Huskies struggled mightily against the East, losing their next 5 games, giving up 90 points or more in three of those games.\nRoster.\nRoster current as of September 9, when their summer prospectus was published.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\" | Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"\" | "

        "text": "The 2010 Lakeside World Professional Darts Championship was the 33rd World Championship organised by the British Darts Organisation, and the 25th staging at the Lakeside Country Club at Frimley Green. Ted Hankey was the defending men's champion having won the title for the second time in the previous year's final against Tony O'Shea. The defending women's champion was Francis Hoenselaar, having beaten seven-time champion Trina Gulliver in the 2009 final.\nPlayers from 32 countries around the globe competed to reach the BBC televised finals, which ran from 2–10 January at Frimley Green. The men's top seed was O'Shea. Julie Gore was top women's seed, ahead of Gulliver. There were 11 debutants at the world championships. Also for the first time two brothers, Tony and Steve West, were playing in the same world championship.\nThe tournament is also remembered for the first round match between Martin Adams and Anthony Fleet, which featured what has been called \"the worst leg of darts ever\". The opening leg included visits of 26, 41, 5, 41, 22 and 11 by a visibly nervous Fleet. Adams himself had visits of 47, 44 and 32, but eventually won the 54-dart leg and went on to win the match 3–0. Fleet's match average of 65.34 was the lowest of the championship and described as \"pub standard\".\nMartin Adams was the winner of the men's championship beating unseeded Dave Chisnall 7–5 in the final. Trina Gulliver won the Women's Championship for the eighth time beating Rhian Edwards 2–0.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nMen's.\nThe televised stages featured 32 players. The top 16 players in the WDF/BDO rankings over the 2008/09 season were seeded for the tournament.\nAn unusually high total of 11 of the seeded players were knocked out in the first round.\nThe 32 players who qualified for invitation into the first round proper of the men's singles were:\nWomen's.\nThe televised stages featured 8 players. The top 4 players in the WDF/BDO rankings over the 2008/09 season were seeded for the tournament.\nThe eight women qualified for invitation were:\nPrize money.\nThe 2010 World Championship had a prize fund of £325,000 – a rise of £5,000 on the previous year.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe tournament has been broadcast by BBC Sport every year since its inception. Having fronted their coverage since 2001, Ray Stubbs did not host their broadcasts in 2010 following his decision to join ESPN the previous summer. He was replaced by BBC Radio 5 Live and \"Football on Five\" presenter Colin Murray. Rob Walker, the Master of Ceremonies at BBC's snooker events and host of the BBC's 2009 Winmau World Masters coverage presented the late night highlights and \"Darts Extra\" through the night on BBC2. Walker was also the roaming reporter during BBC2's live coverage. Bobby George once again was the pundit.\nThe commentary team was David Croft, Tony Green and the tournament's number 1 seed Tony O'Shea. Again, every dart was shown live, via the BBC's interactive coverage on its Red Button service – with the semi-finals and final both broadcast live on BBC1/BBC2 on the last weekend.\nIn Germany the tournament was broadcast by Eurosport. There was no coverage on SBS in the Netherlands, for the first time in several years as they chose to follow the majority of their players who featured in the PDC World Championship instead."

        "title": "2009 Breeders' Cup",
        "text": "The 2009 Breeders' Cup World Championships were the 26th edition of thoroughbred racing's season ending premier event, and took place on November 6 and 7 during the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The event was telecast by ESPN. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December.\nThe highlight of the weekend was Zenyatta's victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic, marking the first time a female horse had won the race. Horses from Europe and California won the majority of races.\nHighlights.\nThe Breeders' Cup Classic was the most anticipated race of the 2009 event, especially because of the decision by the connections of mare Zenyatta to enter her against male horses in the race instead of attempting to defend her title in the Ladies Classic (aka the Distaff). Zenyatta would face eight grade/group I-winning males, including horses who had won the Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes, Travers Stakes (in both 2008 and 2009), Jockey Club Gold Cup, Santa Anita Handicap, Pacific Classic, Arlington Million, Man o’ War, Champion Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, Sussex Stakes, and Manhattan Handicap. Zenyatta ran in last for most of the race then starting making up ground on the far turn, racing on the inside to save ground. When her path along the rail was blocked, she angled sharply to switch paths to the outside, then started closing again, eventually defeating Gio Ponti by a length. She became the first female to win the Classic in its 26-year history. \"I was able to cut the corner with her off the turn, and that made the difference,\" said jockey Mike Smith. \"She started to get to them in the stretch, and the crowd started screaming. Then she started looking at the crowd, so I had to get after her a little bit, but she still won within herself.\"\nEuropean horses enjoyed success with two wins on Friday (Midday in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf and Man of Iron in the Marathon), followed by four wins on Saturday (Pounced in the Juvenile Turf, Vale of York in the Juvenile, Goldikova in the Mile, Conduit in the Turf). California-based horses won several of the remaining races, including Zenyatta in the Classic, her stablemate Life Is Sweet in the Ladies Classic, California Flag in the Turf Sprint and Dancing in Silks in the Sprint. The relatively poor showing by horses from the East Coast was attributed by some to the synthetic dirt surface of the main track, with which horses from the East Coast had little experience. Noted turf writer Andrew Beyer wrote, \"If the Breeders' Cup is a championship race, it's the championship of California, Britain and a few scattered tracks that have installed synthetic surfaces. But it is not a championship event in the way its creators intended.\" \nThe total handle (amount bet) at the Breeders' Cup exceeded $150 million for the first time, up by over 4% from 2008. In addition, an estimated $24.75 million was wagered through Betfair. There was one winning Pick-6 ticket on the Saturday card, which paid $1,838,305. The television ratings on ESPN were also up, particularly for the segment covering the Classic, which increased from a 1.1 rating in 2008 to a 3.1 in 2009.\nFriday.\nThe Friday attendance was 37,651.\nSaturday.\nThe Saturday attendance was 58,825."

However, this was soon rescinded and there was instead an emphasis placed on \"business as usual\" through the war. Sports began to resume once more with a limited schedule. The County Championship was cancelled, but county sides put out teams to play against each other and against representative sides. Charles Jones formed London Counties, a side that played their games at Lord's Cricket Ground, and other locations around London. London Counties played its first recorded game, a two-day match against Northamptonshire XI on 18 May 1940, winning by 128 runs. They relied primarily on established southern professionals, and gained a reputation for being a team of \"hitters and known fast scorers\".\nDuring the war years, London Counties formed a friendly rivalry with a British Empire XI, a similarly set up representative side. Both of these sides did a lot of work for war charities."

The season commenced on 1 May at Silverstone and ended on 10 October at Circuit Zolder. The season featured six double-header rounds, with each race lasting for a duration of 60 minutes. Most of the events were support races to the newly formed FIA GT1 World Championship.\nDespite FIA's efforts to slow down the Callaway Competition-entered Chevrolet Corvette of Christian Hohenadel and Daniel Keilwitz via extensive performance balancing, the pairing finished the season as champions, taking four victories to secure the title with a meeting to spare; the second such championship crown for a team running a Corvette after the 2008 triumph of French duo Arnaud Peyroles and James Ruffier. \nThe championship-winning margin for Hohenadel and Keilwitz was 46 points over the Prospeed Competition Porsche of Paul van Splunteren and Marco Holzer, who took two wins over the course of the season at Portimão and Zolder. Another Corvette, run by Graff Racing, finished in third place with drivers Joakim Lambotte and Mike Parisy, who won both races at Brno. Four other duos took race victories during the season; Siso Cunill and Tim Bergmeister of Trackspeed won the season-opening race at Silverstone, Kenneth Heyer and Bernd Herdlhofer, and Csaba Walter and Claudia Hürtgen won at Jarama for Team Rosberg and Schubert Motorsport respectively, with the other Schubert Motorsport car of Patrick Söderlund and Edward Sandström winning at Zolder.\nProspeed Competition won the Teams' Championship, but were only confirmed as champions in December following a hearing to the FIA International Court of Appeal. Van Splunteren and Holzer had been disqualified from a victory at Zolder, due to a technical infringement regarding the weight of the car's rear brake discs. \nUltimately, Prospeed were reinstated which allowed them to regain the teams title which Callaway Competition had assumed from the disqualification. Callaway finished second, ten points behind Prospeed, with Schubert Motorsport finishing third. In the Manufacturers' Cups, the top-two overall placings for Hohenadel and Keilwitz, and van Splunteren and Holzer helped to claim the cups for Corvette and Porsche respectively. The other cup, for Audi drivers, was won by Ireland's Seán Paul Breslin for the German Black Falcon team.\nEntries and Drivers.\nThe list below contains the confirmed teams and drivers that competed in the 2010 championship.\nCalendar.\nOn 23 October 2009, just before the final round of the 2009 season, the FIA World Motor Sport Council announced the 2010 calendar in co-ordinance with the FIA GT1 World Championship.\nChampionships.\nThe GT3 Championship adopted the new Formula One points system, meaning points were awarded to the top ten finishers in both races.\nManufacturer's Cups.\nThe Manufacturer Cups were open to any manufacturer who supplied two or more teams in the full season.

This game was originally scheduled for Braves Field in Boston, which had hosted in 1936. When the Braves relocated to Milwaukee in mid-March, the game was awarded to Cincinnati.\nSummary.\nFrom 1949 through 1952, manager Casey Stengel had taken the New York Yankees to four consecutive World Series titles, but this time turned on his fourth defeat in a row at the helm of the American League team.\nRobin Roberts (NL) and Billy Pierce (AL) found themselves in a pitching duel during three innings of one-hit shutout ball, but they were not a factor in the decision. AL relievers Allie Reynolds (2), Mike Garcia (1) and Satchel Paige (2) combined to give up five runs to the NL hitters.\nThe NL attack was led by Enos Slaughter, who went 2-for-3 with two runs and an RBI, while Pee Wee Reese hit a single and a double and drove in two runs. Minnie Miñoso went 2-for-2 and drove in the only run for the AL team.\nNL relievers Warren Spahn and Curt Simmons pitched two scoreless innings each and Murry Dickson allowed the only AL run in two innings of work. Spahn was the winning pitcher and Reynolds the loser, while Dickson earned the save.\nThe National League extended their winning-streak to four consecutive games, matching the previous record set by the American League from 1946 to 1949, After the game, the American League leads 12–8.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nLine Score.\n\"Play-by-play at Retrosheet\""

The program grew swiftly and posted a winning record by its third season. In their fourth season, the team posted an impressive 25-6 mark and had the nation's leading scorer on the roster, Dave Skalko. When Heyliger retired in 1974, turning the team over to John Matchefts, the success continued with two more 20+ win seasons in three years. By the time the 1980 rolled around, however, the team's on-ice results began to flag and after a pair of disappointing, single-digit-win seasons Matchefts pushed his team to a .500-record before turning control over to the program's all-time leading scorer. Chuck Delich led the program for the 12 seasons, posting moderate results for most of his tenure, but as the 20th century drew to a close, the Falcons' days as a plucky Independent were numbered.\nCHA.\nIn 1997, former Denver head coach Frank Serratore was hired to replace Delich and recorded two 15-win seasons before everything changed for the Falcons. In 1999, Air Force became a founding member of the CHA, joining with the other service academy Army and five other newly-minted Division I teams. Despite the other programs having little history of success, Air Force was unable to make much headway in the conference, with the best finish being 4th out of 7 teams in their inaugural year. Army left the conference after only one year, leaving the conference with only six programs, and the Falcons found themselves as one of the worst. Air Force finished in 5th- or 6th-place for four consecutive seasons and threw in a pair of 4th-place marks for good measure. Despite their regular season woes, the Falcons did achieve some success in the CHA tournament, reaching the semifinals three times despite being an underdog. By 2006, however, it became apparent that the CHA was in trouble. The Falcons left the CHA and were accepted into Atlantic Hockey, rejoining Army in the same conference.\nAtlantic Hockey.\nThe change seemed to suit the Falcons, who posted their first winning season in 7 years. In the conference tournament, Air Force defeated Holy Cross 3-0 before stunning #1 seeded Sacred Heart 5-4 in overtime. In the championship match, the Falcons took on Army and routed the Black Knights 6-1 to win the program's first conference championship and receive their first bid into the NCAA tournament. Though they lost to Minnesota in the opening round, the success would continue for the next two years with two additional Atlantic Hockey tournament titles and culminated with a 28-win season in 2009 where they won their first regular season conference title and NCAA tournament game. After a middling season in 2010, the Falcons posted back-to-back conference championships but failed to escape the first round in either season. Air Force spent the mid-teens rebuilding their program, and it came to a head in 2017 with their sixth Atlantic Hockey crown. The Falcons played so well over the course of the season that there was some talk of them making the NCAA tournament even if they were to lose the Atlantic Hockey championship (an exceedingly rare occurrence for Atlantic Hockey Teams). Their second quarterfinal appearance was followed by another in 2018, where they were outplayed by eventual champion Minnesota–Duluth until the final period.\nAwards and honors.\nU.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.\nThe following individuals have been inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nNCAA.\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nCollege Hockey America.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nStudent-Athlete of the Year\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-CHA\nSecond Team All-CHA\nAll-CHA Rookie Team\nAtlantic Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Defenseman\nScoring Champion\nRegular Season Goaltending Award\nIndividual Sportsmanship Award\nCoach of the Year\nTournament MVP\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nSecond Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nThird Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nAll-Atlantic Hockey Rookie Team\nStatistical Leaders.\nCareer Scoring leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nCareer Goaltending Leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nFalcons in the NHL.\nGoalie Shane Starrett signed an Entry Level Contract with the Edmonton Oilers of the NHL on April 10, 2017.

        "text": "Cycling in Perth, Western Australia is common on the roads and paths for recreation, commuting and sport. Between 1998 and 2009 the number of cyclists in Perth increased 450%.\nCycling facilities in Perth.\nOn-road bike lanes.\nBike lanes exist on some of Perth's major roads while many others have parallel shared paths.\nBike routes and recreational paths.\nThere are some bike routes and recreational paths in Perth that are popular for cycling for the pleasure of a day or evening out of doors or for light exercise, or as a way of getting around. Most are interrupted by road crossings, road works, slow points or just end abruptly. Many new developments have caused disconnection in what was a previously continuous shared paths such as Elizabeth Quay, the new Scarborough Beach redevelopment and the Reid Highway / Mitchell Freeway overpass. Nearly all of the paths are \"shared paths\" – shared by cyclists, pedestrians and other users. Some of the major routes include:\nAlso Rottnest Island, 19 km off the coast of Fremantle, is ideal to explore by bicycle because private vehicles are not permitted on its roads.\nRail trails and long-distance routes.\nThere are also rail trails and long-distance trails, such as the existing Railway Reserve Heritage Trail, and the Munda Biddi Trail, which runs 1,000 kilometres from Mundaring in the Perth Hills to Albany on the state's south coast.\nPrincipal Shared Paths.\nThe Perth Principal Shared Path (PSP) network is a web of off-road paths that form the backbone of the Perth Bicycle Network. PSPs are shared pedestrian and bicycle paths that primarily follow freeway and rail corridors, they have a high degree of separation from traffic utilising bridges and tunnels to bypass intersections. The PSP network is constructed according to the Western Australian Department of Main Roads \"Standards and Guidelines for Shared Paths\".\nThe Western Australian Government has a policy of including the construction of Principal Shared Paths when building major road projects such as the Gateway WA Project and the Forrest Highway. The rollout of PSP routes along railway corridors is largely complete within 10 km of the Perth Central Business District however work continues on the construction of PSP paths adjacent to the rest of the radial Perth rail network.\nThose who do not wish to ride the whole way to their destination can mix their commute with public transport by park and riding or by taking their bike with them on the train except during main commuting times mornings and evenings where bikes are prohibited on trains.\nPark and ride.\nCommuting is made easier by park and ride facilities at Perth train stations. There are different types of bicycle parking. A guide published by TransPerth outlines the bicycle facilities available at each Perth train station as well as the rules and regulations around bicycles and public transport.\nTransperth's bike shelters are secure sheds for locking your bicycle in at Perth train stations, they can be accessed by anyone who registers their Smartrider for access on the Transperth website. Users may register for access to a maximum of two bike shelters on the Transperth network at any one time, users can access the bike shelter 24 hours a day.\n there are approximately 450 bike lockers at suburban railway stations and major bus stations throughout the metropolitan area although no more than 3 at any one location. Where available lockers have been positioned in areas monitored by surveillance (closed circuit TV). Users are required to provide their own lock (D lock or padlock) and observe the Conditions of Use that are displayed on alternate doors of each locker set. It is recommended that a top quality padlock that has a hardened steel body and shank be used for security purposes.\nOver 200 bike racks are provided at suburban railway stations and major bus stations in the Perth metropolitan area. These facilities are usually located on or near platforms for convenience and security purposes.\nBikes on public transport.\nBikes are permitted on all Transperth train services except for city-bound morning peak (weekdays 7.00am and 9.00am) services and trains heading out of the city in the afternoon peak (weekdays 4.30pm and 6.30pm). Bikes cannot depart or pass through Perth, Perth Underground or Elizabeth Quay stations in any direction during these periods – Transperth asks that cyclist get off, ride through the city, then re-board outside of these stations.\nFolding bicycles are however permitted in peak times as long as they are in a carry bag, exceed no more than 79 cm x 59 cm x 36 cm in size, and are kept out of the aisles.\nBikes (excluding folding bicycles) are not allowed on any Transperth bus services.\nAdvocacy and promotion.\nThere are many cycling-related recreational, social and charity events every year in Perth as well as events to promote cycling in general, such as Ride to Work day and the Cycle Instead Challenge. This is based on the \"Cycle Instead\" social marketing campaign, coordinated by the WA Department of Transport, which was established in October 1999.\nCycling events.\nAs with other cities in Australia road cycling has become a popular pastime and sport. The organization Cycling Western Australia organises, facilitates and promotes many road racing events, including Western Australia's premier road cycling event, the Tour de Perth. Perth also hosts the premier track cycling event called Perth International Track Cycling Grand Prix. There are also many mountain bike events."

During that tour, many New Zealand cricket players had small matches between the two touring sides. Since that time, various local competitions have existed, but it was not until 1989 that the New Zealand Baseball Association was formed, consisting of teams in the Auckland area. Ed Mason and Mike Reilly invited perspective players to register their interest. They then formed the New Zealand Baseball Association, with Ed Mason being President and Mike Rielly taking on the Vice President position. City Blues was the first Club under this umbrella and every year in commemoration of this, there is a \"Ed Mason Classic\" played. It would be 14 more years before baseball would venture out of Auckland with the creation of the Canterbury Baseball Club in 2003. 2006 saw the Northland Baseball Club and the Manawatu Baseball Club form.

ABC broadcast AFL games from the league's first season in 1960 until the 1964 season, when NBC took over as the league's primary network television broadcaster.\nTerms of the deal.\nOn June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with ABC, which brought in revenues of approximately $2,125,000 per year for the entire league. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the AFL Championship Game and the AFL All-Star Game. These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on Thanksgiving Day. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the National Football League would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts.\nInnovations.\nABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players \"miked\" during broadcast games.\nList of commentators.\nPat Hernon hosted ABC's national postgame show out of New York. While ABC did show scores and updates from both the AFL and NFL, seldom if ever did viewers see any actual AFL highlights except from the game that had just been broadcast in their region, or nationally. They however, never showed any actual NFL highlights whatsoever."

        "text": "The men's pursuit competition in biathlon at the Vancouver 2010 Olympics was held at Whistler Olympic Park in Whistler, British Columbia on February 16, 2010. It was won by Swedish athlete Björn Ferry, after both Ferry and second place finisher Christoph Sumann of Austria successfully pursued and overtook the leader at the start of the race, France's Vincent Jay.\nCompetition.\nThe pursuit takes place over a distance of . The start of the competition was marred by irregularities in how officials released athletes at the beginning of their runs. In pursuit competitions, athlete's start times are staggered by the differences in their times in a previous sprint, in this case the 10km sprint event held on February 14. Thus, officials need to release athletes to begin the event at exact times. Athletes in both the men's and women's pursuit competitions were started earlier and later than their appropriate times, resulting in a number of complaints from coaches and athletes. Officials attempted to correct the errors by making alterations in the final times of competitors. Nonetheless, media reports cited the incident as embarrassing for the International Biathlon Union. Norbert Baier, the chief technical delegate from the IBU at the Games and the official responsible for ensuring that the rules were implemented correctly by officials, called it, \"the worst day of my career.\"\nFollowing the sprint, Vincent Jay of France led the field and started first. Jay would continue to set the pace throughout much of the race. Björn Ferry of Sweden, who started the race in 8th place more than a minute behind Jay, pushed hard through much of the race and finally overtook Jay in the final lap. Following Ferry, Austrian Christoph Sumann also overtook Jay and won the silver medal. Jay held on to third place, beating his closest opponent by less than three seconds at the finish line, and securing the bronze medal. Ferry's victory was the first Olympic biathlon gold medal won by a Swedish athlete in 50 years. Norwegian competitors Emil Hegle Svendsen and Ole Einar Bjørndalen, a five-time Olympic champion, were expected to do well before the race but failed to live up to those expectations. Svendsen missed four shooting targets and Bjørndalen finished nearly a minute behind Ferry.\nConfusion and starter errors.\nObservers and participants reported that several starter errors occurred during the race start. Competitors Jeremy Teela and Jean-Philippe Leguellec were started too early, before racers who were seeded higher than them. Teela stated that the early start threw-off his strategy, contributing to his missing two targets in his first two shooting range stops. Said Teela, \"We have a couple more races this week. Hopefully the organizers figure this problem out and they make the races fair.\" Starter confusion was reportedly also present during the Women's pursuit earlier that day. U.S. coach Per Nilsson stated that he had never seen an Olympic biathlon as poorly managed as the February 16 women's race."

        "text": "The NSU Sharks Men's Basketball team represents Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida. They currently compete in the Sunshine State Conference.\n They won a national championship in the 2022–23 season.\nHistory.\nThe 2007–08 Nova Southeastern University men’s basketball team posted a 10–18 overall record and a 5–11 Sunshine State Conference mark, but the short-handed Sharks played with heart and battled despite being saddled with multiple injuries. The Sharks, who played the entire season without forwards Dionte Perry and David Naylor due to injury, were also without the services of Kevin Chester, Josh Wood, Ross Allsop and Lemar Dyer for games throughout the season.\nNSU played a top notch non-conference schedule even though they play in the highly competitive SSC. The Sharks squared off against five NCAA Tournament teams, including South Region Tournament host and SSC Champion Florida Southern three times. Showing that they were up to the challenge, NSU defeated FSC once and dropped a tough overtime decision to the Moccasins in their three match-ups.\nThe Sharks started the season with two losses on the road to NCAA Tournament teams, Alabama-Huntsville and North Alabama. Remaining on the road, NSU\ncaptured back-to-back victories over West Florida and Palm Beach Atlantic before coming home and winning three consecutive games, including their win over Florida Southern.\nHit by the injury bug, the Sharks would drop six of their next seven games. NSU then pulled off a 77–76 SSC victory over Saint Leo on the road. Seemingly on the right track, NSU won two of their next three SSC games before an 85–83 overtime loss to Florida Southern sent the Sharks into a tailspin.\nFrom that point on, multiple injuries to key players led to inconsistencies, as the Sharks would struggle to put together a complete line-up on the\ncourt. NSU managed to re-group after five consecutive losses to defeat SSC defending champs Rollins in a 95–94 double overtime thriller, but couldn’t carry the momentum over in its final three games.\nA 78–58 loss to eventual conference champion Florida Southern in the SSC Tournament ended the Sharks’ season at 10–18, including a 5–11 record in the Sunshine State Conference.\nAs a result of his play during the season, junior Tim Coenraad garnered several postseason honors. He was selected to the All-Region First Team by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. He also received Second-Team All-SSC and Daktronics All-Region nods. Additionally, his work in the classroom paid off as he was named to the CoSIDA/ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District Second Team.\nThe Sharks bid farewell to three seniors – guards Jason Del Calvo and Oresti Nitsios and center Chester.\nDel Calvo, a four year player, saw action in 47 games in his career at NSU. He averaged 1.1 points per game. He scored a career high 11 points as a junior in the Sharks’ season-opener vs. Alabama Huntsville.\nNitsios, also a four year player, played in 109 games in his Sharks career. As a senior, he played in 27 games, receiving 16 starts, averaging\n7.3 points per game. He averaged a career-high 9.3 points per game as a sophomore in 2005–06.\nChester, a transfer from Division I’s Campbell, played three years at NSU. He averaged 13.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game in his senior campaign. Kevin scored more than 20 points in six of his last seven games in 2007–08. He ti ed the NSU single-game scoring record with a 39-point eff ort against Rollins on Feb. 20. Chester finished his career sixth in NSU history with 457 total rebounds."

Both a men's and a women's tournament was announced in the programme but a schedule conflict with the EuroBasket 2009 tournament meant that only the women's competition was held.\nCyprus, originally the leaders of Group A, were disqualified from the competition. It was discovered that some of the country's team members were not fully naturalised citizens, including one American, one Polish, one Serbian and two Croat players. The organizers proposed, in keeping with the spirit of the Games, to maintain the scheduled match against France but its result was not taken into account."

        "text": "Leo Gerard Williams AO RFD (14 May 1941 – 14 October 2009) was an Australian rugby union official, who played for the Queensland Reds (1961–1965), managed the team (1971–1972) and also served as president of Queensland Rugby Union (1988–1995), chairman of Australian Rugby Union (1994–1996) and as a board member of Rugby World Cup (1995–2000), eventually becoming chair (1997–2000). As chair he oversaw the RWC 7s tournament in Hong Kong in 1997 and the 1999 Rugby World Cup won by the Australian Wallabies.\nWilliams attended school at Nudgee College and was captain of the swimming team and a member of the First XV in his final year. He graduated in 1958 and commenced arts/law degrees at the University of Queensland in 1959. He earned three University blues in swimming, water polo and rugby having represented the State of Queensland in all three sports in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He graduated in 1964.\nWilliams played Brisbane club rugby for the University of Queensland Rugby Club winning three first grade premierships in 1962, 1964 and 1965. He also served as a trustee of the club and coached Under 18 and Under 19 teams in the late 1960s. Williams played his first game for the Queensland Reds against the New Zealand All Blacks in a mid-week game in 1961 as a 21-year-old. He toured with the Queensland team to New Zealand (1962) and Fiji (1965). He also played against the touring South African rugby Springboks in 1965. He retired from the game as a 25-year-old after the 1965 rugby season ended.\nWilliams was a commercial lawyer by trade who also had a successful business career before becoming involved with rugby administration. He establishing the legal firm Williams and Williams in 1966 with his father Leo (Senior) and provided advice to a number of entities across the mining, media and sporting industries throughout the 1960s, 1970s and the early 1980s. Williams retired from his full-time legal practice in 1983 to concentrate on his business activities. He remained aligned to the legal industry for the next two decades, acting as a consultant in the Brisbane office of Freehills until just before his death.\nAs a result of his legal work, Williams was appointed to a number of boards during the 1970s and 1980s, including becoming the chair of radio station Triple M Brisbane (4MMM) when it was established in 1980 after the State Government offered up a new FM radio licence for potential bidders. Leo and partners from Sydney's 2MMM radio station were leaders of the successful consortium. At the time FM radio was not the dominant frequency in operation across the industry, but using new technologies and marketing strategies quickly grew a dominant position in the local market. The station changed its name to FM104 and at one point during the 1980s garnered over 37% of Brisbane's listening audience. The business was sold to Hoyts Entertainment in 1987, at the time owned by Christopher Skase.\nDuring the 1980s Leo was also chairman of the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, the Brisbane Bullets and served on the Channel 7 Board. Williams was chair of the Bullets when the team moved home games to the Entertainment Centre, drawing league leading crowd attendance and regularly competing in the NBL Grand Final, which the team won in 1985 and 1987.\nBetween 1985 and 1989 Leo was president of Tattersall's Club in Brisbane, and was a driving force behind the club's redevelopment in the early 1990s. The Williams Room at the club is named after him.\nWilliams also served in the Army Reserve Legal Corp for over 25 years from the late 1960s, earning the Reserve Force Decoration in the early 1990s.\nWilliams returned to rugby as president of the QRU in the late 1980s and served as president until 1995. During his period with the QRU the amateur predecessor competition of the current Super Rugby tournament was established. Originally known as the Super 6 it comprised teams from Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, before South African teams were added in 1993 to form the Super 10 tournament. Queensland won the Super 6 title in 1992. They also won the Super 10 title in 1994 and 1995. Williams joined the ARU Board in 1994 as chair, a position he retained until 1996. He joined the board of the Rugby World Cup in 1995, and attended the tournament in South Africa which was famously won by the South African Springboks.\nWilliams was chair of Australian Rugby Union during the formation of SANZAR, a governing body which united ARU with New Zealand Rugby Union and South African Rugby Union and which operates the Super Rugby and Tri Nations championships. Along with Louis Luyt (South Africa) and Richie Guy (New Zealand), he was one of the signatories to a broadcasting contract with News Limited which signified rugby union's transformation to a professional sport.\nWilliams also served on the PA Research Foundation for more than a decade and was a member of the Queensland Racing Appeals Tribunal in the 1990s and early 2000s. During the 1990s Williams was Honorary Consul for Samoa and South Africa in Queensland.\nIn January 2000 Williams was awarded an AO for services to Business, the Community and Rugby, thereby becoming an Officer of the Order of Australia (General Division).\nLeo was married to Nancye from January 1966 until his death in October 2014 and had four children, Nicole Juliet (born 1966), Paul Leo (born 1968), Anthony David (born 1969) and Julienne Brigitta (born 1974)."

In 1890 Leake became one of the original members of the Barbarians.\nLeake also played cricket as a youth, representing Dulwich College. Despite his father winning four sporting 'Blues' for Cambridge at cricket, Leake instead focused on rugby, winning three 'Blues' at rugby football.\nPersonal history.\nLeake was born in Ceylon in 1865 to William Martin-Leake and Louisa Harriet Tennant. William was a civil engineer who was employed in Ceylon, but later became a coffee-planter. Louisa was the daughter of Col. Sir James Tennant of the Bengal Artillery. Leake was educated in Britain, at Clifton College in Bristol and Dulwich College in London, before matriculating to Selwyn College, Cambridge in 1885. He received his BA in 1888 and from 1889 to 1909 he was an Assistant Master at Dulwich. In 1909 he was ordained as a deacon, and then as a priest in 1910 at Southwark Cathedral. From 1909 he held two positions at Dulwich, Assistant Chaplain of the College and Head of Dulwich Preparatory School. Leake held both posts until his retirement in 1937, but after portions of the school were unable to be evacuated owing to the air-raids of World War II, he returned to take charge of part of the school. His son, Major Stephen Philip Martin-Leake, died in Albania during World War II.\nLeake was also a published writer, compiling a history of Arthur Herman Gilkes, a headmaster of Dulwich College; the book is titled \"Gilkes and Dulwich, 1885–1914: A Study of a Great Headmaster\" (1928).\nRugby career.\nLeake first came to note as a rugby player when he captained Dulwich College rugby team in 1883–1884; he was also captain of the college cricket team in 1884. When Leake matriculated to Selwyn College he then represented Cambridge University. Leake won three sporting 'Blues' at University in 1885, 1886 and 1887, all awarded for rugby for playing in the Varsity Match. Cambridge won all three matches during this period, and although Leake did not score in any of the games he played well, especially in 1886 and 1887, setting up a late try in the 1887 game.\nOn leaving Cambridge, Leake continued to play rugby and joined Harlequins. In 1890 while representing Harlequins, Leake was approached by William Percy Carpmael to join his newly formed invitational touring team, the Barbarians. Leake accepted and became a founding member of the club.\nLeake gained his first international cap during the 1891 Home Nations Championship, an away game to Wales at Rodney Parade. Leake had an excellent debut, setting up Christopherson's first try after eluding his Welsh counterpart Hugh Ingledew. England won 7–3, and Leake was rewarded for his confident start with selection for the next two games of the tournament. Leake, partnered at half back with John Berry, was part of a winning England team in the second game, against Ireland, but England lost to Scotland in the Championship decider. The next season, the English selectors chose the Bradford pairing of Emmott and Briggs at half back, and Leake never represented his county again.\nLeake is mentioned briefly in Hugh de Selincourt's fiction book \"Realms of Day\"; Selincourt would have been familiar with Leake as a past pupil of Dulwich College, a few years behind Leake."

The club does not currently compete in either the Minor Counties Championship or MCCA Knockout Trophy, but does play informal matches, typically against armed forces teams and county academies.\nEarliest cricket.\nCricket probably reached Huntingdonshire in the 17th century. The earliest reference to the game in the general region is in neighbouring Cambridgeshire at the University of Cambridge in 1710. In 1741, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich became patron and captain of a Huntingdonshire county team which, as part of a united Northamptonshire &amp; Huntingdonshire team, twice defeated Bedfordshire in important matches.\nOrigin of the club.\nHuntingdonshire County Cricket Club was first formed in 1831 and existed until 1895. Initially, until the early 1850s, matches were played against club sides but from the start of the 1850s the club found regular County opponents.\nUp until 1874 Huntingdonshire played home matches at Millers Holme, Godmanchester. From 1874 the club played at the Huntingdon Cricket Club Ground and continues to do so to this day. In 1895 the club was disbanded. In the 1920s the club was briefly reformed before folding once again. The current county club was formed in 1948.\nFrom 1999 to 2003, the county entered teams into the English domestic one-day competition, matches which had List A status. The county played seven List A matches during this period, with the final List A match it played coming against Cheshire. During this period, the club used The Parks, Godmanchester as its home ground.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Huntingdonshire County Cricket Club when it was permitted to play List A and MCCA Knockout Trophy matches. These grounds have also held List A and MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.\""

There were 117 competitors from 28 nations, with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Akinori Nakayama of Japan, the nation's second consecutive victory in the parallel bars event, tying Germany and the Soviet Union for second-most all-time behind Switzerland at three gold medals. It was the second of four straight Games that the parallel bars would be won by a Japanese gymnast. Mikhail Voronin took silver and Viktor Klimenko took bronze to put the Soviet Union back on the podium after a one-Games absence.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Five of the six finalists from 1964 returned: gold medalist Yukio Endo of Japan, bronze medalist Franco Menichelli of Italy, fourth-place finisher Sergey Diomidov and fifth-place finisher Victor Lisitsky of the Soviet Union, and sixth-place finisher Miroslav Cerar of Yugoslavia. Diomidov had won the 1966 world championship, with fellow Soviet Mikhail Voronin second and Cerar third.\nEcuador and the Philippines each made their debut in the men's parallel bars; East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. The United States made its 11th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score.\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the new apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 117th. In the final, each gymnast performed an additional voluntary exercise; half of the score from the preliminary carried over."

        "text": "John Allen Henson (born December 28, 1990) is an American professional basketball player who played eight seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels, where he was a two-time ACC Defensive Player of the Year. Henson was selected with the 14th overall pick in 2012 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks and played his first seasons with the team before being traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in December 2018. In February 2020, he was traded to the Detroit Pistons.\nHigh school career.\nFor three years, Henson attended Round Rock High School in Round Rock, Texas. His senior year, Henson transferred to Sickles High School in Tampa, Florida. Henson wore the jersey number 33, averaging 17.6 points, 12.2 rebounds, and 6.1 blocks per game as a senior in 2008–09. He scored a season-high 29 points against Tampa Bay Tech and blocked 10 or more shots five times with a high of 11 on four occasions as a senior as well. Henson led the team to a 24–5 record and a perfect 10–0 league record, but the team lost to Lakeland 48–43 in the regional semi-finals for the Florida FHSAA Class 6A championship. Henson was a first-team all-state selection and Tampa Bay Coaches Association Player of the Year. He played in the McDonald's All-American Game and the Nike Hoop Summit. He also earned first-team \"Parade\" All-American honors.\nRecruiting.\nHenson was a highly sought-after forward and was rated by Scout.com as the #1 power forward and the #4 overall player in the 2009 recruiting class. Analysts predicted he would be an important addition to what some thought would be the best front court in the nation for the 2009–10 season. When asked to evaluate Henson, head coach Roy Williams said Henson had \"tremendously long arms\" and predicted he would \"probably block more shots than any perimeter player in college basketball.\"\nCollege career.\nAt the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Henson began as a small forward for the 2009–10 Tar Heels, but with the season-ending injury to Ed Davis, Henson moved to power forward in mid-February 2010. After the move, Henson's performance improved, and he averaged 9.4 points per game in the last 16 contests of the season. However, the Tar Heels missed the NCAA tournament, losing to the Dayton Flyers in the NIT finals.\nAs a sophomore in the 2010–11 season, Henson was the winner of the ACC Defensive Player of the Year award for 2011 after averaging 11.7 points, 10.1 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. As a junior in 2011–12, he was again named the ACC Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 13.7 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game.\nOn March 29, 2012, he declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final year of college eligibility.\nProfessional career.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2012–2018).\nOn June 28, 2012, Henson was selected with the 14th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 10, 2012, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks. On April 10, 2013, he had a season-best game with 17 points, 25 rebounds and seven blocks in a 113–103 loss to the Orlando Magic. A week later, he scored a career-high 28 points in a 95–89 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nOn October 19, 2013, the Bucks exercised their third-year team option on Henson's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2014–15 season. In 2013–14, he averaged 11.1 points and 7.1 rebounds per game as he came off the bench in 47 of the 70 games he played.\nOn October 16, 2014, the Bucks exercised their fourth-year team option on Henson's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season. Henson played in 67 games for Milwaukee in 2014–15 (11 starts), averaging 7.0 points and 4.7 rebounds per game. He finished fifth in the league for blocks per game with 2.01 and became one of just seven players in Bucks history to average over 2.0 blocks in a single season. Henson blocked at least one shot in 20 straight games from December 26 to February 22, which was the third-longest streak during the 2014–15 season.\nOn October 2, 2015, Henson signed a four-year, $45 million contract extension with the Bucks. On November 6, 2015, in just his second game of the 2015–16 season, Henson scored a season-high 22 points off the bench in a 99–92 win over the New York Knicks.\nOn October 29, 2016, Henson hit the game-winning buzzer-beater tip-in against the Brooklyn Nets. In 21 minutes off the bench, he recorded 12 rebounds, seven points, three assists, two steals and two blocks in the 110–108 win. On November 27, 2016, he scored a season-high 20 points in 104–96 win over the Orlando Magic.\nOn February 4, 2018, Henson had season highs with 19 points and 18 rebounds in a 109–94 win over the Brooklyn Nets.\nOn November 16, 2018, Henson was ruled out for approximately 12 weeks with a torn left wrist ligament. He underwent surgery on November 28.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2018–2020).\nOn December 7, 2018, Henson was traded, along with Matthew Dellavedova and the Bucks 2021 first and second round picks, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a five-player, three-team deal. The Cavs also received the Washington Wizards 2022 second round pick. The Bucks received George Hill, Jason Smith and a 2021 second round pick. The Wizards received Sam Dekker.\nDetroit Pistons (2020).\nOn February 6, 2020, the Cavaliers traded Henson, Brandon Knight, and a 2023 second round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Andre Drummond.\nOn April 5, 2021, the New York Knicks signed Henson to a 10-day contract; however, he did not see action with the team.\nOn March 8, 2022, Henson signed with Mets de Guaynabo of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). However, he didn't play any games with them.\nPersonal life.\nHenson is the son of Matt and Annette Henson. His father played basketball for Norfolk State University. His sister, Amber, played basketball for Duke University.\nHenson is an ambassador for Up2Us Sports, a national non-profit organization dedicated to supporting underserved youth by providing them with coaches trained in positive youth development."

Yukio Endo of Japan took silver, while Soviet Sergei Diomidov earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the six finalists from 1964 returned: silver medalist Victor Lisitsky of the Soviet Union, bronze medalist Hannu Rantakari of Finland, and sixth-place finisher Yukio Endo of Japan. Reigning gold medalist and world champion Haruhiro Yamashita of Japan did not compete.\nEcuador made its debut in the men's vault; East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. The United States made its 11th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. (One gymnast who entered the all-around competition did not perform on the vault.) \nThe event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the new apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 116th. In the final, each gymnast performed an additional voluntary exercise; half of the score from the preliminary carried over."

        "text": "The Hampshire Cricket Board (HCB) was formed in 1996 and is the governing body for all recreational cricket in the historic county of Hampshire. Following a restructuring in January 2010, the HCB now operates as a limited company.\nHistory and role.\nThe Board's aim is to nurture the game of cricket at a recreational level, increase the levels of participation in cricket, identify and nurture future county players, and provide players with the opportunities to advance to the highest level of the game.\nThree years after the HCB was formed, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) reformed the NatWest Trophy by allowing all twenty Minor counties and the cricket boards of all first-class English counties. These matches held List A status, with the HCB defeating Suffolk in its first match in the 1999 NatWest Trophy. The HCB played eight List A matches before the ECB reduced the competitions size, which resulted in the cricket boards being excluded from future competitions. It won three of its eight matches. The HCB employed the services of future international players Graeme Smith and Chris Tremlett, and played its home matches at the County Ground, Southampton, Grasmere Road, Cove, the Rose Bowl, and The Quarters, Hursley Park. The Board was also permitted to take part in the Minor counties one-day competition between 1998 and 2002.\nAs part of its role to develop the game in Hampshire the HCB offers a number of ECB accredited courses involving coaching, physical training, umpiring and scoring. Qualified coaches are then able to join the HCB Coaches Association and ECB Coaches Association, with both associations helping coaching communication and individual practical development. The HCB Association is run by a management committee which consists of officials from local cricket clubs which are affiliated with the HCB.\nStructure.\nPrior to 2010 the HCB was run using an executive committee which had a number of sub committees linked to it, which included the Senior Cricket Committee, Finance Committee, Facilities Committee and Officiating (Umpires and Scorers) Committee. At the HCB Annual General Meeting in January 2010, it was decided that it would become a limited company, in doing so becoming the Hampshire Cricket Board Ltd.. This required the structure of the HCB to be changed to accommodate this change. The executive committee was replaced with a board of directors. This currently comprises:\nThe board of directors oversees the four-year development strategy which covers the period from 2007 to 2011, as well as delivering an improvement action plan each year which has agreed aims with the England and Wales Cricket Board. Successful implementation of the improvement action plan and reaching quantitative targets, secures funding from the ECB. In its new form the sub committees have been restructured. These are the Senior Cricket Committee, Finance Committee, Facilities Committee, HCB Coaches Association and Hampshire Association of Cricket Officials.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by the Hampshire Cricket Board representative side when it was permitted to play List A and MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.\""

        "text": "The four-man bobsleigh competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, was held at the Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia, on 26–27 February. The German team of André Lange, René Hoppe, Kevin Kuske, and Martin Putze were the defending Olympic champion in this event. America's team of Steve Holcomb, Justin Olsen, Steve Mesler, and Curtis Tomasevicz were the defending world champions in this event. The test event was won by the Latvian team of Jānis Miņins, Daumants Dreiškens, Oskars Melbardis, and Intars Dambis. The last World Cup event prior to the 2010 Games place took place in Igls, Austria (southeast of Innsbruck) on 24 January 2010 and was won by the German team of Lange, Hoppe, Kuske, and Putze. Holcomb of the United States won both the four-man and the combined World Cups.\nRecords.\nWhile the IOC does not consider bobsled times eligible for Olympic records, the FIBT does maintain records for both the start and a complete run at each track it competes.\nThe start and track records were set at the test event for the 2010 Games on 7 February 2009.\nQualifying teams.\nOn 20 January 2010, the FIBT announced that the following teams had qualified for the 2010 Games: This was finalized on 26 January 2010.\nPractice.\nSupplemental training was offered on 19 February 2010 to both the two-woman and four-man bobsleigh events out of caution and further preparation for both events that would take place the following week.\nMinor changes were made to the track on 22 February 2010 after bobsleigh four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary training. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, training runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 so it would be easier for sleds to get through the rest of the track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone stated that \"...some drivers have been experiencing difficulties transitioning from turn 11 to turn 12.\" As a result, Krone stated that \"The FIBT track commission, in conjunction with VANOC and with advice from a number of team captains, are working on the shape of turn 11 to make it easier for drivers to get high enough on 11 to turn 12 so that they can successfully make it through turn 13.\" Krone also stated that it was common that the profile of corners were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines (luge and skeleton).\nAfter track alterations were done on 23 February 2010, the two fastest four-man times were done by Germany's Lange and the United States' Holcomb. Australia withdrew its four-man team on 23 February 2010 to two of its crew members, Duncan Harvey and Duncan Pugh, suffering concussions. Australia chef de mission Ian Chesterman stated that the decision was not taken lightly and was done on the side of safety. Meanwhile, Latvia's Janis Minins returned to practice on the 23rd in the wake of the emergency surgery on 12 February in the wake of an appendicitis attack. Minis withdrew from the four-man event two days later to crashing twice during practice where one of his crews suffering a concussion and another suffering bruised lungs and elbows.\nLange had the fastest practice times on the 24th with the final two practices taking place on the 25th. That same day, Australia withdrew to injuries to Harvey and Pugh of Australia while Edwin van Calker of the Netherlands withdrew due to a lack of confidence of driving the four-man sled during the event. This was also despite no crashes during four-man training had taken place prior to the 24th. The Dutch team supported van Calker's decision on this.\nDuring practice American bobsledder Bill Schuffenhauer was detained by police on 25 February, in the wake of an argument with his fiance, but he was later released for reasons not disclosed by Canadian authorities. Schuffenhauer competed in the four-man event for Mike Kohn's USA-3 sled. USA-3 finished 13th.\nResults.\nThe first two runs took place on 26 February at 13:00 PST and 14:45 PST. On 27 February, the final two runs took place at 13:00 PST and 14:40 PST.\nDefending world champion Holcomb posted the fastest track times in the first two runs while defending Olympic champion Lange had the fastest start times in the first two runs. Russia-2 driven by Zubkov, the defending four-man silver medalist and bronze medalist in the two-man event at these games, crashed out in the first run when one of his steering ropes broke. Austria-1 and Slovakia-1 also crashed out in the first run, and neither sled started the second run, nor did Russia-2. Second run crashes involved USA-2, Great Britain-1, and Japan-1. USA-2 did not participate in the 3rd run of the event. Lange, the defending Olympic champion, also had the fastest two start times in the final two runs and the fastest track time in the final run while Holcomb had the fastest track time in the third run. Rush was second after three runs, but Lange's fastest track time in the fourth heat allowed the German, with Rödiger replacing Hoppe, to beat the Canadian by 0.01 seconds to win silver. In the final race of his career, Lange did not win a gold medal in an Olympic bobsledding event. It was the first gold medal for the U.S. men in bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics since Francis Tyler's four-man win at St. Moritz in 1948.\nIn attendance was former NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine, 1986 Daytona 500 winner and co-founder of the Bo-Dyn Bobsled Project, who watched one of his sleds driven by Holcomb (\"Night Train\") win the gold medal. The first Bo-Dyn sleds debuted at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer though it would take eight more years in Salt Lake City before the Americans medaled. Bodine expressed his satisfaction with the project prior to the start of the four-man event.\nTR = Track Record. Top finish in each run is in boldface."

The February 2009 test event held at the Olympic venue was won by the American duo of Shauna Rohbock and Elana Meyers. The last 2009–10 Bobsleigh World Cup event took place four weeks prior to the 2010 Games and was won by the American duo of Rohbock and Michelle Rzepka while Kiriasis had finished on top of the overall 2009–10 World Cup season standings.\nRecords.\nWhile the IOC does not consider bobsled times eligible for Olympic records, the FIBT does maintain records for both the start and a complete run at each track it competes.\nThe start and track records were set at the test event for the 2010 Games on 6 February 2009.\nQualifying teams.\nOn 20 January 2010, the FIBT announced that the following teams had qualified for the 2010 Games: This was finalized on 26 January 2010.\nAustralia was added following a 9 February 2010 Court of Arbitration for Sport decision for inclusion of them in the two-woman event in the wake of the exclusion of Oceania from the event.

American bobsledder Shona Rohbock expressed concerns on the 19th that the track could generate speeds that are too dangerous for racing. She stated that she had never experienced speeds at even bobsleigh track she had experienced, event at the St. Moritz track. Officials had told Rohbock that they are considering sanding the runners to slow down the sleds to slow down the speeds. Elana Meyers, an American brakewoman, commented on Twitter that same day that \"We (referring to her and her driver Erin Pac) went .. that's fast!\" Assistant Coach of the US Team, Scott Argir, was also on record about the abnormalities of the track. One crash occurred on the 19th for the two-woman event when Dutch bobsledder Esme Kamphuis crashed out in the final corners of the track.\nMinor changes were made to the track on 22 February 2010 after bobsleigh four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary training.

Meanwhile, defending world champion Minichiello's sled flipped over after turn 12 during the third run, but the British driver and her brakeman Cooke walked away from the crash at the finish line. Minichiello and Cooke decided not to start the final run. In the final run, Russia 2 crashed which kept them at their finishing position of 18th place. Germany 2's team of Martini and Logsch were in fourth place after the third run, but were disqualified after Martini crashed in turn 13, causing Logsch to be ejected from the sled. Test event winners Rohbock and Meyers of the United States, the defending world championship silver medalists, finished sixth and third, respectively. Humphries broke the start record for the first two runs and tied it in the third run while also breaking the track record during the first three runs. Pac had a bad final run, dropping the sled she and Meyers had from second to third. Upperton had the fastest time to move Canada 2 from third to second in the final run.

        "text": "The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) section of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification saw 43 teams competing for 4 or 5 berths in the final tournament in Brazil. As in recent tournaments the AFC had four direct qualifiers for the finals tournament in addition to a further possible place via the intercontinental play-offs against CONMEBOL's fifth-placed team, which was chosen through a random draw, rather than being decided by FIFA beforehand as in previous tournaments (e.g., 2010 against a team from OFC, 2006 against a team from CONCACAF). Iran and South Korea from Group A, along with Australia and Japan from Group B won the 4 direct qualification positions, with Jordan defeating Uzbekistan in a play-off to see which team would face the 5th placed CONMEBOL team, Uruguay, for a place in the World Cup, eventually also failed to qualify for the competition.\nFormat.\nThe main qualifying draw took place in Brazil on 30 July 2011. Initially it was announced that the AFC Competitions Committee decided to use the 2010 qualification format for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The AFC published information in their calendar suggesting qualifiers would start on 8 October 2010 with the first leg of first round ties.\nTherefore, for the 2010 finals, FIFA advised the AFC that 2014 qualifiers could not begin until after mid-2011. On 13 August 2010 the AFC announced a format for the qualifiers that was identical to the 2010 format even though the final number of qualifiers had not been determined. A final format, with the initial stages modified slightly from 2010, was announced in March 2011.\nQualification began with two sets of two-leg knock-out qualification rounds – the first held on 29 June and 2 July and 3 July 2011 and the second on 23 and 28 July – reducing the number of teams in the main draw to 20. As in the 2010 format, the third stage consisted of 5 groups of 4 teams (with matches held between September 2011 and February 2012) with the top 2 in each group advancing to 2 groups of 5 that will play a further group stage during 2012 and 2013. The top two teams in each group qualify for the 2014 finals directly, with the two third-placed teams playing-off for a chance to qualify via an intercontinental qualifying tie. A random draw determined that the final tie would be against the fifth-placed team from CONMEBOL qualification.\nEntrants.\n43 of the 46 AFC national teams entered qualification. A ranking list for the qualification rounds was released by AFC on 8 March 2011, with an updated list released due to the non-participation of Guam and Bhutan.\nThe rankings determined the round of qualification that teams began competition:\nFirst round.\nThe first round consisted of eight home-and-away series, featuring the 16 lowest ranked teams in Asia. The winners of these series proceeded to the second round.\nSeeding.\nTeams were seeded into two pots – Pot 1 included teams ranked 28–35 and Pot 2 teams ranked 36–43.\nMatches.\nThe first round draw of the Asian qualifiers took place on 30 March 2011 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The first legs were played on 29 June 2011 and the second legs were played on 2 and 3 July 2011.\nSecond round.\nThe second round consisted of fifteen home-and-away series, featuring the 8 winners from the first round and other 22 teams ranked 6–27. The winners of these series then proceeded to the third round.\nSeeding.\nTeams were seeded into two pots – Pot 1 included teams ranked 6–20 and Pot 2 teams ranked 21–27 along with the 8 first round winners.\n† First round winners whose identity was not known at the time of the draw.\nMatches.\nTies were drawn at the same time as the first round. The first legs were played on 23 July 2011 and the second legs were played on 28 July 2011.\nThird round.\nThe third round saw the 5 automatic qualifiers joined by the 15 winners from the second round. These teams were drawn into five groups of four teams, at the World Cup Preliminary Draw at the Marina da Glória in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 30 July 2011. The matches were played from 2 September 2011 to 29 February 2012. The top two teams from each group advanced to the fourth round.\nSeeding.\nThe July 2011 FIFA Ranking – released on 27 July – was used to seed the teams. (Rankings shown in brackets)\nNote. Syria were replaced by Tajikistan in the third round on 19 August 2011 following the awarding of both second round matches to Tajikistan.\nFourth round.\nThe fourth round saw the group winners and runners-up from the third round play in two groups of five. The top two teams from each group advanced to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, while the two third-placed teams advance to the fifth round. Japan, South Korea, Australia and Iran have qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nSeeding.\nThe draw for Round Four was held on 9 March 2012 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with the teams seeded according to their March 2012 FIFA Ranking. The FIFA rankings used were released on 7 March 2012 and included all matches from the third round of Asian qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The ten teams (shown below with their March 2012 FIFA Ranking in brackets) are split into five pots, with each group containing a team from each pot.\nGroups.\nThe matches were played from 3 June 2012 to 18 June 2013.\nAs the competition partially overlapped with the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, which was held from 15 June 2013, the AFC decided that the match day will be adjusted for Japan, the representative of AFC for the Confederations Cup, placing them on Position 5 in their group in order not to play on 18 June 2013.\nFifth round.\nThe two teams who finished third in the fourth round groups (Jordan and Uzbekistan) played each other to determine the AFC participant in the intercontinental play-off.\nThe draw for the fifth round of the AFC qualifiers was held in Zürich on 19 March 2013 during meetings of the Organising Committee for the FIFA World Cup. The games took place on 6 and 10 September 2013. With the two teams still evenly matched at full-time in the second leg, Jordan eventually progressed to the intercontinental playoff after winning 9–8 on penalties.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThe fifth round winner, Jordan, played against CONMEBOL's fifth-placed team, Uruguay, in a home-and-away play-off. The winner of this play-off, Uruguay, qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals.\nThe first leg was played on 13 November 2013, and the second leg was played on 20 November 2013.\nQualified teams.\nThe following four teams from AFC qualified for the final tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are full goalscorer lists for each round:"

Several days later, officials within CONCACAF announced the qualifying format they would present to FIFA. The proposed format, which was subsequently accepted by FIFA, consists of 4 stages.\nEntrants.\nAll 35 FIFA-affiliated national teams from CONCACAF entered qualification. The seeding – used to draw the first three rounds of the qualifiers – was based on the FIFA World Rankings of March 2011.

Early indications were that the matches would be played on 3 and 7 June 2011; However, the matches were postponed to scattered days in June and July, between 15 June and 17 July. The 5 winners (in bold, below) advanced to the second round of the CONCACAF qualifiers: Belize, Dominican Republic, U.S. Virgin Islands, Saint Lucia, and the Bahamas.\nThe two wins for the U.S. Virgin Islands were their first two ever in World Cup play, with their only other win prior to this coming in 1998.\nSecond round.\nIn the second round, the teams ranked 7–25 were joined by the 5 winners from the first round.

The new structure saw the four lowest ranked entrants play a single round-robin tournament from 22 to 26 November 2011 in Samoa. The top team in this tournament then joined the other seven teams in the 2012 OFC Nations Cup, with the four semifinalists from that tournament advancing to the third round. This stage was originally scheduled to be held in Fiji in June 2012, but on 14 March 2012 the hosting rights were stripped from Fiji as a result of an ongoing legal dispute involving OFC general secretary Tai Nicholas and Fijian authorities. The loss of the finals was confirmed by the Fiji Football Association on 16 March.\nThe third round consisted of a double round-robin held on a home-and-away basis, scheduled to take place between 7 September 2012 and 26 March 2013.

        "text": "Samuel Chestley Smith Sr. (January 27, 1943May 18, 2022) was an American professional basketball player who played four seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA). He played for the Minnesota Muskies, Kentucky Colonels, and Utah Stars from 1967 to 1971. Prior to turning professional, he was noted for being one of the first three African American basketball players at the University of Louisville. He later transferred to Kentucky Wesleyan College and helped the school win its first NCAA Division II championship in 1966.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born in Welch, West Virginia, on January 27, 1943. He later relocated to Hazard, Kentucky, and attended Hazard High School, where he played American football and basketball. He was selected to the state's high school basketball All-Star team in 1962 to face the Indiana All-Stars. Later that year, he joined the University of Louisville after being recruited by Bernard Hickman, the Louisville Cardinals coach who also scouted Wade Houston and Eddie Whitehead. The trio became the first black basketball players at the University of Louisville, as well as the first at a traditionally white university in the state. Smith was the first of the three players to start for the Cardinals, as well as the most convincing candidate for playing time and chief rival of Judd Rothman, the Cardinals incumbent starting center.\nCollege career.\nDuring his sophomore year (his first on the varsity team), Smith averaged 9.2 points per game (PPG), and led the school in scoring. However, he was found to be academically ineligible for the team halfway through the season in February 1964. He consequently left Louisville, claiming that it was \"too big for him\", and transferred to Kentucky Wesleyan College. Together with Dallas Thornton and George Tinsley, he helped the Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers to the NCAA Division II championship in 1966, the first of eight titles for the school. In the final 15 seconds of the championship game, Smith made a layup to break a 51–51 tie and give the Panthers the victory over Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Smith, who scored more than 20 points in that game, was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nSmith received two All-American selections during his college career and was honored as the All-NCAA South Region Most Outstanding Player twice. He was also named to the NCAA Championship All-Tournament Team in 1967. He finished with 1,102 career points and 714 rebounds. He was selected in the third round (28th overall selection) of the 1967 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals. He was ultimately signed by the Minnesota Muskies of the American Basketball Association (ABA) later that year.\nProfessional career.\nSmith made his ABA debut with the Muskies on October 22, 1967, scoring 24 points to go along with 14 rebounds against the Kentucky Colonels. He played 77 games during his rookie season (18th most in the ABA), recording the eleventh-lowest turnover percentage (9.7) and fourth-most defensive win shares (5.2) that year. After one season with the franchise, he joined the Colonels in 1968. During the 1969–70 season, he finished fourteenth in the league in offensive rebounds (301), sixteenth in defensive win shares (3.3), nineteenth in total rebounds (719), and twentieth in rebounds per game (8.9). He was then traded to the Utah Stars late during the 1970–71 season. This consequently limited his playing time with the franchise, with Smith playing just one game in each of the Stars' three playoff series that year. The Stars ultimately won the championship in seven games against the Colonels. It turned out to be his final appearance in the ABA.

        "text": "Joseph Howell Cox (born November 27, 1986) is an American football coach and former college football quarterback. He played college football for four seasons at the University of Georgia, and was the team's starting quarterback for the 2009 season.\nEarly years.\nCox started at Independence High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was named to the 2004 \"Parade Magazine\" All-America Team and \"Super Prep\" All-Mid Atlantic Team. He was the North Carolina Gatorade Player of the Year. He was on the \"Associated Press\" first-team All-State team and was twice a \"Charlotte Observer\" Offensive Player of the Year. He also played in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas and impressed scouts by going 31–0 as a starting quarterback. He was twice a team captain and was rated the number 7 quarterback in the country by \"Rivals\" and Tom Lemming of ESPN. He set a North Carolina record with 66 touchdown passes while taking his team to its fifth consecutive state championship his senior year. He was named the MVP of the state title game twice. As a junior, he threw for nearly 4,000 yards and over 40 touchdowns. As a senior, he completed 240 out of 363 passes for over 4,500 yards and only five interceptions.\nCollege career.\n2005–2008.\nCox was redshirted in his freshman year in 2005. During the first four years of his career at the University of Georgia, Cox had scattered playing time and completed 33 out of 58 pass attempts for 432 yards with five touchdowns and one interception. As a redshirt freshman in 2006, with Georgia trailing Colorado 0–13 at home late in the third quarter, Cox was put in the game to relieve the ineffective starter Matthew Stafford. Cox threw for 153 yards and two touchdowns late in the game to lead Georgia to a comeback win, 14–13. Cox started one more game in the season, in a 14–9 victory over Ole Miss, but eventually lost his starting place to the highly-touted Stafford, who ended up being the first overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.\n2009.\nWhile Cox threw for over 1,200 yards and 11 touchdowns and had a 146.4 quarterback rating in his first four games of the 2009 season, he did not perform as well in the next few games. Georgia finished the season 8–5 with Cox as the starter. In Georgia's 52–41 win over Arkansas in Fayetteville, he threw for a career-high 375 yards and matched a team record with five touchdown passes. Against the #1-ranked Florida Gators, he completed 11 of 20 pass attempts for two touchdowns, which was as many as the Gators had allowed all season, but also threw three interceptions in the 17–41 loss. In his final game at Sanford Stadium, the Bulldogs had a 14-point half-time lead, but Cox threw two interceptions in the fourth quarter. Along with a red-zone fumble (as Georgia was attempting to tie the game), these interceptions sealed a loss against Kentucky, Georgia's first home loss to the Wildcats since 1977. However, Cox was not asked to do much in the final regular season game against the #7-ranked Georgia Tech. With Bulldog tailbacks Caleb King and Washaun Ealey combining for 349 rushing yards, he managed the game well, completing 8 of 14 passes for just 76 yards and a touchdown in Georgia's 30–24 victory.\nCoaching career.\nIn June 2013, Cox joined the coaching staff at Mallard Creek High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, as the quarterbacks' position coach. On December 14, 2013, the Mallard Creek team won its first state championship. In 2014, he became the offensive co-ordinator for Mallard Creek and led the Maverick offense to its second state title on December 13, 2014.\nOn February 3, 2015, it was announced that Cox had left Mallard Creek High School to become a graduate assistant for the Colorado State Rams. In January 2016, he was promoted to tight ends coach for Colorado State.\nOn January 10, 2020, it was announced that Cox had joined the coaching staff of the South Carolina Gamecocks football as tight ends coach.\nFollowing the departure of the former offensive co-ordinator/wide receivers coach Bryan McClendon to Oregon, Will Muschamp moved Bobby Bentley back to tight ends and Cox was moved to wide receivers. \nIn December 2020, the new South Carolina head coach, Shane Beamer, announced he had hired a new team of coaches, and that Cox would not be retained. He was replaced by the former Arkansas wide receivers coach, Justin Stepp.\nOn February 15, 2021, Cox was named the Charlotte 49ers' tight ends coach.\nOn February 4, 2022, Cox was named tight ends coach for the University of Alabama."

        "text": "Rugby union in Kuwait is a minor sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe Kuwait Rugby Football Union is the governing body, but is currently under the Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union (AGRFU). The AGRFU was founded in 1977, and joined the IRB in 1990. By the end of 2010, the AGRFU will be broken up, with new unions to be established in each member country, as announced in January 2009 by the IRB. The first national union to be formed from the AGRFU is expected to be that of the UAE.\nHistory.\nRugby was first brought to the region, by the British military around the mid 20th century. In addition, some Arabian royals and nobles have been sending their sons to English private schools for years, where they have picked up the game.\nThe sport was reintroduced by Commonwealth ex-patriates working in the oil industry, and they continue to \ndominate the game. \nThe sport experienced some expansion in Kuwait during the 1980s. The club had always played at Ahmadi under the auspices of the Kuwait Oil Company, but due to company policy the ground was closed to the rugby club. This resulted in the members building a new ground in Fintas and changing the club’s name. The club returned to Ahmadi in 1989.\nUnfortunately the Gulf War in 1990-91 created many problems, from damage to physical infrastructure, and great hardship to residents. The war caused the deaths of around 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians killed during the Iraqi occupation in addition to 300,000 refugees. Many of Kuwaiti rugby's main supporters, i.e. white expatriates left shortly before or after the conflict.\nKuwait currently has one adult rugby club, The Kuwait Scorpions, having recently reverted to the original name. The club was founded in 1946 and is one of the oldest rugby clubs within the Persian Gulf region. Original numbers dwindled as many players left the country due to the political situation within the region. \nThe Kuwait Saracens RFC, the only youth rugby club in Kuwait, was established at the end of the 08/09 season after lack of funding and ever-dwindling player numbers in the former youth club threatened the future of youth rugby in Kuwait.

This poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll are invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as \"March Madness\".\nESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name.

        "title": "Dustin Brown (tennis)",
        "text": "Dustin Brown (born 8 December 1984) is a German-Jamaican professional tennis player who rose to fame after beating Rafael Nadal at the Halle Open in 2014 and at Wimbledon in 2015. He is known for his technique, speed, and unorthodox playing style, often entertaining the crowd with trick shots. His nickname is \"Dreddy\" due to his distinctive long dreadlocked hair.\nBrown competes mainly on the ATP Challenger Tour, in singles and doubles, having won 31 titles overall. He achieved his career-high singles ranking of No. 64 in October 2016 and his career-high doubles ranking of No. 43 in May 2012. Brown is notable for being one of only two players who are undefeated against Rafael Nadal after playing more than one match with him, holding a 2–0 head-to-head record.\nBrown has yet to reach an ATP singles final, but has made two semifinals at the 2016 Open Sud de France and the 2016 Swiss Open Gstaad. In doubles, he has won two titles on the ATP Tour.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born on 8 December 1984 in Celle, West Germany, a town situated near the city of Hanover. His father Leroy met his German-born mother Inge in Jamaica before settling in Celle. This unusual dual nationality has earned him the nickname \"Shabba\" based on a line from Jamie Foxx in the 1997 comedy \"Booty Call\" where he claimed to be a \"Germaican\". He also has two half-brothers named Steve and Dean. He played several sports such as football, judo, and handball throughout his childhood. He started playing tennis at the age of 5 but didn't really focus on the sport until the age of eight: \"When I made the decision to pursue tennis instead of football, of course I wanted to be successful. I didn't want just to end up playing for a club somewhere.\" His reported idol growing up was Russian tennis player and former world No. 1 Marat Safin. His junior tennis career went well enough to draw the attention of Kim Michael Wittenberg, an American who ran a tennis academy near Hanover. Wittenberg regularly gave Brown lessons, and according to his pupil, he \"taught me to play tennis.\"\nAt 11 years old, in 1996, the family returned to Jamaica, settling in Montego Bay. The move was motivated in part by the high cost of training in Germany as well as his need to develop discipline on the court: \"I was pretty mentally soft when I was young. Anything could happen when I played—I could lose my temper, I got disqualified.\" In Jamaica, track and field, soccer, and cricket were the sports that commanded the best resources, tennis was played on poorly maintained public courts and with low-quality balls. Nevertheless, he continued to play junior tennis.\nIn 2004, 20-year-old Brown became unhappy with tennis in Jamaica, his family thought his potential warranted returning to Germany and a Volkswagen campervan that could sleep up to three people set him up. The mobile lodgings enabled him to play in the various European tournaments: \"It was a brilliant idea by my parents, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go on playing. It was a means of competing week in, week out.\" He also brought in income with his racquet stringing machine, giving other players lower cost service, and letting out his spare mobile accommodations for a night.\nJunior career.\nBrown played his first junior match in August 1999 at the age of 14 at a grade 4 tournament in Jamaica. In 2002, he competed in two junior Grand Slam tournaments, reaching the second round of Wimbledon in singles as a qualifier and the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open in doubles partnering Luka Gregorc. Brown achieved a career-high junior singles ranking of 61 on March 18, 2002, and ended his junior career with a 34–26 record. In doubles, he achieved a career-high ranking of 116 on November 11, 2002, and a 15–24 overall record.\nJunior Grand Slam results – Singles:\nAustralian Open: A (-)\nFrench Open: A (-)\nWimbledon: 2R (2002)\nUS Open: 1R (2002)\nJunior Grand Slam results – Doubles:\nAustralian Open: A (-)\nFrench Open: A (-)\nWimbledon: 1R (2002)\nUS Open: QF (2002)\nProfessional career.\n2002–2009.\nBrown officially turned pro in April 2002 at the age of 17 and began representing Jamaica. Between 2002 and 2009, Brown reached 11 ITF singles finals and 32 ITF doubles finals, winning 3 singles titles and 16 doubles titles.\nBrown made his ATP debut at the 2003 Hall of Fame Open after qualifying for the main draw. He lost in the first round to Bob Bryan in three sets.\nBrown reached his first Challenger final at the 2009 Baden Open where he lost to Florian Mayer in straight sets. Three months later, he won his first Challenger title at the 2009 Samarkand Challenger defeating Jonathan Dasnières de Veigy in the final. For the rest of 2009, he made four more Challenger finals including one doubles final. These results helped increase his ranking from 494 at the start of the year to 144 at year's end.\n2010–2019.\n2010 is considered to be Brown's breakout year. At the SA Tennis Open in Johannesburg, South Africa, he made his first ATP main-draw appearance since 2003, defeating fourth seed Marco Chiudinelli and No. 139 Laurent Recouderc to reach the quarterfinals, where he lost to eventual runner-up Stéphane Robert. He became the second Jamaican after Doug Burke at the 1989 BP National Championships in Wellington, New Zealand, to reach the quarterfinals of an ATP tournament.\nOn May 17, 2010, Brown reached the top 100 for the first time, debuting at No. 99. In June, he competed in his third ATP main draw at the Queen's Club Championships in London, defeating Frank Dancevic in three sets before losing to Denis Istomin in the second round. It was reported at the time that lack of funding and support from the Jamaican Tennis Association had tempted him to switch national association to Great Britain, his paternal grandmother being British. Later that month, Brown made his Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon after receiving direct entry into the main draw. He lost in the first round to 16th seed Jürgen Melzer in four sets. After another ATP quarterfinal at the 2010 Hall of Fame Open, Brown received direct entry into the US Open and won his opening match against Rubén Ramírez Hidalgo to record his first Grand Slam win. He lost in the second round to world No. 4 Andy Murray in straight sets.\nIn September 2010, Brown won his first ATP doubles title at the 2010 Open de Moselle partnering Rogier Wassen.\nIn October 2010, Brown began representing Germany and competed under the German flag for the first time at the Challenger Eckental, where he reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Igor Sijsling. His first title success playing under the German flag came a week later at the Lambertz Open, defeating Sijsling in the final.\nBrown won his second ATP doubles title at the 2012 Grand Prix Hassan II partnering Paul Hanley.\nBrown partnered Jonathan Marray at the 2012 French Open; they lost in the first round. Brown/Marray also reached four Challenger tour finals in 2012, winning two in Bosnia and Italy.\nAt 2013 Wimbledon, Brown qualified for the main draw and went all the way to the third round defeating Guillermo García López and former champion Lleyton Hewitt before falling to Adrian Mannarino in straight sets.\nAt the 2014 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, Brown upset first seed and world No. 9 John Isner in the second round to claim his first-ever win over a top 10 player. He would lose to Sam Querrey in the next round.\nIn 2014 he achieved his most significant career win by defeating world No. 1 Rafael Nadal at the Halle Open as a wildcard.\nAt Wimbledon in 2015 Brown came through qualifying without dropping a set. After beating Yen-hsun Lu in the first round, Brown then upset, for the second time in his career, 10th seed and two-time champion Rafael Nadal in four sets in the second round, before losing to Victor Troicki in four sets in the next round.\nIn January 2016, Brown played world No. 1 Novak Djokovic at the Qatar Open. He lost in straight sets.\nBrown reached his first singles semifinal on the ATP World Tour at the 2016 Open Sud de France after having lost eight consecutive quarterfinal matches. There, he lost against top seed and eventual champion Richard Gasquet in three sets.\nBrown reached a career debut second round of the French Open in 2016.\nAfter winning the 2016 Aegon Manchester Trophy, Brown received a wild card for the 2016 Wimbledon Championships. There, he defeated Dušan Lajović in the first round before losing to Nick Kyrgios in the second. Both matches were decided in five sets.\nBrown made his second ATP singles semifinal at the 2016 Swiss Open Gstaad but lost to top seed and eventual champion Feliciano López in three sets.\nBrown competed in the first round of the 2016 Summer Olympics against Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil. Brown was leading 6–4, 4–4 when he went down with an ankle injury. Medical staff taped him, he returned to the match playing two points. Bellucci increased the score to 4–5 in the second set. Brown could not return play and retired in tears.\nOn October 10, 2016, Brown achieved a career-high singles ranking of 64 and ended the yeer ranked 72.\nBrown upset world No. 7 Marin Čilić at the 2017 Open Sud de France. He would retire after just one game of play against Benoît Paire in the next round due to a back injury.\nBrown lost in straight sets to Andy Murray at Wimbledon in 2017 in the second round.\nBrown qualified for the 2018 Australian Open in what would be his last grand slam to date. He lost to João Sousa in the first round in five sets.\nAt the 2018 Open Sud de France, Brown was one game away from defeating Nicolas Mahut in the first round, but he sustained a back injury and could not continue to play giving Mahut the victory. He left the court in tears.\nIn April 2019, Brown reclaimed an ATP Challenger singles title from three years previous at the Mouratoglou Open in Sophia Antipolis, winning the final over Filip Krajinović in straight sets.\nOn 13 June 2019, Brown upset compatriot and world No. 5 Alexander Zverev at the 2019 Stuttgart Open in the second round. Following this victory, he lost in a third-set tiebreaker to Félix Auger-Aliassime in the quarterfinal.\n2020–present.\nBrown reached the qualifying competition of the 2020 French Open Qualifying and the 2021 Australian Open Qualifying before being eliminated both times.\nThroughout 2021, Brown seemed to focus less on singles and more on doubles as he was competing in more doubles events than singles and was finding more success as he was reaching a handful of quarterfinals and semifinals in challenger events and ATP events.\nBrown received a wildcard into the 2021 Stuttgart Open due to his performance in the previous edition. He lost in the first round to Nikoloz Basilashvili in straight sets. This was his last professional singles match.\nIn 2022, Brown stopped representing Germany and returned to representing Jamaica in tournaments.\nDue to persistent injuries since the start of 2018, Brown announced in January 2024 that he would retire from professional tennis at the end of the 2024 season.\nDavis Cup.\nBrown made his Davis Cup debut for Jamaica in 2003 which would be the only time he played for Jamaica at the Davis Cup. He won 4 of 5 singles matches played and all 3 doubles matches played.\nBrown only played one match for Germany in 2015 in the singles where he lost to Dominican Víctor Estrella Burgos in four sets.\nBrown's combined record for Jamaica and Germany is 4–2 in singles and 3–0 in doubles giving him an overall record of 7–2.\nStyle of play.\nBrown is considered a serve-and-volleyer as he is known for his big serves and lightly volleying the ball in once it is returned to him. His serve speed averages at around 190–205 km/h but has reached up to 220 km/h.\nBrown's shotmaking style is very unorthodox as he mixes his shots up with hard-hitting groundstrokes to light drop shots which makes his opponents have to be ready for anything on every point. He is also known for his impressive trick shots where he hits very difficult shots from difficult positions. These shots include tweeners, behind-the-back shots, diving shots, down-the-line shots, jump shots, drop shots, etc. This causes his playing style to be highly entertaining to the crowd as most tennis fans call him one of the most entertaining players on the tour.\nBrown is also known for his very fast returns and winners on both his forehand and his backhand and his net and volleying skills.\nPerformance timelines.\nDoubles.\n\"Current through the 2023 ATP Tour.\"\nRecord against top 10 players.\nBrown's match record against players who have been ranked in the top 10,with those who are active in boldface. &lt;br&gt;\nOnly ATP Tour and ATP Challenger main draw matches are considered."

        "title": "Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle",
        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1964 Olympic Games took place between October 11 and 12. There were 66 competitors from 33 nations. Nations were again able to bring up to three swimmers each after a one-Games limit of two in 1960. The event was won by Don Schollander of the United States, the nation's first victory in the event since 1952 and eighth overall (most of any nation). Great Britain (Bobby McGregor's silver) and the United Team of Germany (Hans-Joachim Klein's bronze) both earned their first medal in the men's 100 metre freestyle.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the eight finalists from the 1960 Games returned: fifth-place finisher Gyula Dobay of Hungary and eighth-place finisher Per-Ola Lindberg of Sweden. John Devitt of Australia, the winner of a controversial finish in 1960, had retired, as had silver medalist Lance Larson of the United States. The American team in Tokyo was led by Don Schollander, who was expected to vie with Scotsman Bobby McGregor.\nIran, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and Thailand each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 14th appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 9 heats of 7 or 8 swimmers each. The top 24 swimmers advanced to the semifinals. There were 3 semifinals of 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of two lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1964 Summer Olympics.\nGary Ilman dropped more than a second off the Olympic record in the very first heat, recording a time of 54.0 seconds.

UNI received all but one first-place vote in the preseason poll of MVC coaches, media, and sports information directors. Creighton received the other first place vote. The preseason player of the year was 2009 MVC conference tournament MVP Osiris Eldridge of Illinois State – who tested the NBA draft waters over the offseason.\nAlso in the preseason, three MVC players were named to the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award preseason candidate list: Dodie Dunson of Bradley, Adam Koch of Northern Iowa and Josh Young of Drake.\nPreseason All-MVC Team.\nPreseason Player of the Year \nRegular season.\nNon-conference.\nBradley was dealt a tough blow in their season opener as, for the fourth consecutive season, the Braves suffered an injury to a key player. Senior guard Dodie Dodson broke two bones in his forearm in Bradley's home opener against Idaho State. Bradley won the game, 74–69, but likely lost Dodson for the season. In another memorable opening games, Creighton hung tough at number 21 Dayton, but ultimately lost down the stretch 70–60. The Bluejays led 46–41 at the half and were within 3 points with 2 minutes left to play. Jake Kelly also made his debut for Indiana State, scoring 16 in an 88–58 win over Nebraska-Kerney.

The centre hosted tennis events of the 2016 Summer Olympics, and the wheelchair tennis events of the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The centre was built on the site of the former Nelson Piquet International Autodrome.\nHistory.\nConstruction.\nThe centre was designed by architect Gerkan, Marg and Partners, along with Schlaich Bergermann Partner.\nThe centre consists of a tennis stadium and 15 ancillary courts. The center court has a capacity of 10,000, with the two temporary arenas with a capacity of 5,000 and 3,000 respectively. The surface will be hard court, supplied by GreenSet.\nConstruction started in 2013 and was completed in 2016. However, the stadium faced numerous hurdles during construction. The biggest of these was when the city of Rio de Janeiro canceled the construction contract 200 days before the start of the games and finned the consortium responsible for delays 11 million reais ($2.7 million).\nOpening.\nIn December 2015, the centre court was named after Maria Esther Bueno, a former Brazilian tennis player, who became the first woman ever to win all four Grand Slam doubles titles in one year. This also marked the first ever event to be held at the Barra Olympic Park, which saw 75 Brazilian tennis players take part in a competition.\nLegacy.\nIn July 2021, it was announced that the centre would be auctioned to the private initiative. However, as of February 2022, it is still managed by the federal government, through the Ministry of Citizenship.\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) has confirmed that, 20 years after the last Davis Cup match played in Rio de Janeiro, the Olympics Tennis Centre is set to host Brazil's match against Germany in the 2022 Davis Cup qualifying round.\nIt also played host to the Rio Tennis Classic ATP Challenger Tour event in December 2021."

In 1934 the Moscow Championship was started.\nIn October, 1935, it is recorded that the Russian capital Moscow played the Belarusian capital Minsk, and won 6-0.\nThe first Soviet Championship took place in 1936, and Minsk team took part in it.

In 1937, there was an unofficial All-Union competition in which two Moscow based teams played ones from Minsk and Gorky.\nIn 1949, rugby union was forbidden in the USSR during the \"fight against cosmopolitanism\". The competitions were resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship in 1966. In 1975 the Soviet national team played their first match.\nBelarus had its own rugby team in the USSR, but it was not treated as a proper national side.\nPost-independence.\nSince the breakup of the USSR, Belarusian rugby has declined greatly. However, there is at least one club active, RC Vepry Minsk. The national team is seeing a resurgence, and played its first game in recent years on 4 October 2014 against Estonia, which resulted in a 58-12 defeat; a promising result against a well-established team. Leonid Zelenkevich, playing in the second row, brought some much needed experience to the team, having spent the last nine years playing for various clubs in England. It is reported that the national team has some fixtures in 2015, in which they hope to cement their reputation as up-and-coming contenders in the Eastern European circuit."

A total of 464 athletes from 25 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these Games. Overall, 14 events were contested in 8 disciplines. Athletes competed in skeleton for the first time, but unlike the previous Olympic Games there was no curling competition and military patrol was a demonstration event rather than a medal event. Both men and women competed in these Games, although women were only allowed to compete in the figure skating ladies' singles and pairs events.\nEighty-three individual athletes won medals, but the ones representing Norway far surpassed their competitors in the medal count, winning fifteen medals to the six won by the nearest NOC, the United States. The only three other NOCs that had medalists in more than one event were Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Twelve of the 25 participating NOCs secured at least one medal, and among these, six NOCs won at least one gold medal.\nSonja Henie of Norway won the gold medal in the women's individual figure skating competition, the first of three consecutive Winter Olympics where she would do so. She was only 15 years old when she competed at the 1928 Games, setting the record for the youngest person to win an Olympic medal, a record she held for 74 years. Competing with an injured knee, Swedish figure skater Gillis Grafström won the men's individual competition for the third consecutive Winter Games. In the 50–km cross-country skiing competition, Swedish athletes took all three medals. Per-Erik Hedlund won the race, which took place during unusual weather conditions (temperatures rose from 0 to 25 °C [32 to 77 °F]), by a span of 13 minutes. Norwegian speed skater Bernt Evensen topped the medal count, winning one gold, one silver, and one bronze medal. Four athletes won two medals each: Johan Grøttumsbråten and Ivar Ballangrud of Norway, Clas Thunberg of Finland, and Jennison Heaton of the United States. Both Grøttumsbråten and Thunberg were multiple medal winners in the previous Olympic Games as well.\nSpeed skating.\nIn the 10,000-meter race, Irving Jaffee was leading the competition, having outskated Norwegian defending world champion Bernt Evensen in their heat, when rising temperatures thawed the ice. In a controversial ruling, the Norwegian referee canceled the entire competition. Although the International Olympic Committee reversed the referee's decision and awarded Jaffee the gold medal, the International Skating Union later overruled the IOC and restored the ruling. Evensen, for his part, publicly said that Jaffee should be awarded the gold medal, but that never happened.\nStatistics.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes who won multiple medals are listed below."

        "text": "The 2008 Giro d'Italia began on 10 May, with Stage 11 occurring on 21 May. The first stage, like it had been in 2007, was a team time trial, a stage where each member of the team raced together against the clock. This stage was won by the American team , who had viewed it as their primary goal in the Giro. It allowed their leader Christian Vande Velde to wear the first pink jersey as race leader. Unlike in most cycling Grand Tours, the first road race stage 2008 Giro was not a flat stage decided by sprinters, but rather one over a hilly course that would be won by a breakaway or a strong climber. Though Stages 3 and 4 were both flat and conquered by sprinters, this meant that it was unlikely that a sprinter would get to wear the pink jersey at any point in the race.\nThe first half of the 2008 Giro contained six stages classified as medium-mountain, though many of them contained difficult, selective climbs that broke up the racing peloton. The sixth stage was shortened from its planned length of . This was due to riders speaking with race officials and asking that the finishing circuit be eliminated, as the long transfers between stage finish towns and start towns the next day had afforded them little rest to prepare for such a long stage. In that same stage, a 12-rider breakaway finished sufficiently ahead of the peloton that one of its members, Giovanni Visconti, became the new overall race leader, a lead that he would maintain for more than a week.\nStage 1.\n10 May 2008 — Palermo, (team time trial)\nThe Giro began, like it had the previous year, with a team time trial (TTT) on one of Italy's islands, this year in Sicily. The course was flat. There was speculation that this stage would result in a second American cyclist to wear the pink jersey (the first having been Andrew Hampsten in 1988), as , , and were all considered favorites to win the stage and all had strong American time trialists on their squads. , one of the first Professional Continental teams announced for the race, held a special training camp in Spain a week before the race specifically to work on their TTT skills.\nThe early time to beat was set by the second team to take the course, , clocking in at 27' 05\". After three other teams came , who finished with only the minimum of five riders together (the team's time is taken for the fifth rider to cross the finish line, with any riders who are dropped given their own times) after David Millar was dropped in the final kilometer. Christian Vande Velde was the first to cross the line for , after 26' 32\". That Vande Velde had been the first over the line rather than time trial specialist David Zabriskie had not been specifically the plan. The next team on course was , who were nine seconds slower than at the first time check and finished in 27' 01\". and were both ahead of at the first intermediate time check, but faded toward the finish and clocked in second and fifth, respectively. 's time held up to the end of the stage, affording Vande Velde the first pink jersey.\nStage 2.\n11 May 2008 — Cefalù to Agrigento, \nThis was a hilly course, in contrast to most Grand Tours, which begin with flat road stages. It contained two categorized climbs, and favored an attacking rider.\nThe significant breakaway of the day comprised David Loosli and Jérémy Roy, after Dionisio Galparsoro had been brought back into the peloton after an earlier attack. Loosli and Roy attained a maximum advantage of over ten minutes. With remaining in the stage for the peloton, a significant crash occurred as they went over a railroad crossing. David Zabriskie was the most seriously hurt, needing to be taken away from the race in an ambulance.\nLoosli and Roy were caught with left to race, as the finishing circuit in Agrigento began. had been at the head of the peloton, protecting race leader Christian Vande Velde, for as long as they could, and during the circuit took over the pace-making. The hilly and difficult circuit made it so many riders lost contact with the leading group, until only a small number of climbers and overall favorites were with the leaders. Joaquim Rodríguez was the first of this group to attack for the stage win, but he was caught in the final few hundred meters by a quintet of Italians, Riccardo Riccò, Danilo Di Luca, Davide Rebellin, Franco Pellizotti, and Paolo Savoldelli. Riccò was the first across the line for the stage win, while Pellizotti's ten second time gap over Vande Velde in 19th gave him the pink jersey.\nStage 3.\n12 May 2008 — Catania to Milazzo, \nThis was the first flat stage of the 2008 Giro. The course began by riding around the perimeter of Mount Etna for a categorized climb, but the final on the seaside of Milazzo were all on elevations of less than , and a sprint finish was the result.\nThe first attempt at a breakaway in this stage did not occur until the mark, as the Mount Etna climb kept the peloton together. At that point, Riccardo Chiarini, Mickaël Buffaz, Jérémy Roy, Kevin Seeldraeyers, Matej Jurčo, and Pavel Brutt broke free and attained a maximum advantage of four minutes. The peloton was careful not to let the time gap get out of hand, and for much of the stage it was only two minutes. A massive crash occurred at the to go mark, when a rider struck a manhole cover and lost control of his bike, colliding with other riders and sending riders and bikes flying. Rain began to fall shortly thereafter, with further crashes claiming victims including Mark Cavendish, Kanstantsin Sivtsov, and the previous day's stage winner Riccardo Riccò.\nThe breakaway was caught with left to race, after which even more crashes occurred. Bradley McGee was taken from the race in an ambulance with a broken collarbone, and though his teammate Stuart O'Grady finished the stage after crashing, it was later learned that he too had broken his collarbone.\nThe succession of crashes did not stop a mass sprint finish, through what was ironically thought the most dangerous part of the course before the stage began. ' Daniele Bennati outmaneuvered Erik Zabel and Danilo Hondo at the finish to claim the stage win and the points jersey. Liquigas also retained the overall race lead with Franco Pellizotti, as well as first in the teams classification. It was Bennati's first career Giro stage win after having previously won stages in the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España.\nStage 4.\n13 May 2008 — Pizzo Calabro to Catanzaro-Lungomare, \nIn this stage, the Giro left Sicily for Italy's mainland. The course for this stage was similar in profile to the one previous, with a high climb coming in the first third of the course before sufficient flat racing to ensure a mass sprint finish.\nThis stage was marked by a long one-man breakaway by rider Rik Verbrugghe. He attained an advantage of eleven minutes over the peloton at one point, but he stood little chance of staying away on a course well-suited for a bunch finish. He was caught with left to race, as , , and worked to get the field together, in preparation for a finish for their strong sprinters. Milram led Erik Zabel out early, but the veteran German was unable to hold on all the way to the finish line. Points classification leader Daniele Bennati was next to try, but he too went too soon and was passed for the win by High Road's Mark Cavendish, who picked up his first career Grand Tour stage win. A crash in the final kilometer, as the sprint was just beginning, brought down Nick Nuyens and two riders, with Nuyens breaking his collarbone and leaving the race in an ambulance.\nStage 5.\n14 May 2008 — Belvedere Marittimo to Contursi Terme, \nThis was the first of four medium-mountain stages. One pre-race analysis suggested that the course's rolling profile suited a breakaway surviving to the finish line.\nIt took several attempts for a successful breakaway to come clear, but by the mark, Luis Felipe Laverde, Johannes Fröhlinger, David Millar, Pavel Brutt, and Francisco Pérez were away. Pérez had begun the stage 1'57\" behind race leader Franco Pellizotti, and as such he was the virtual race leader for much of the stage, as the breakaway held a maximum advantage over the peloton of 7'20\" with left to race. The time gap to the leaders steadily fell from that point, such that Pellizotti's lead did not prove to be in any real danger.\nWith a final long, uncategorized hill remaining in the stage, the fast-closing pink jersey group, 64 riders strong and containing the race's overall favorites, trailed the five leaders by 1'42\". This would prove to be just enough time for the breakaway to be able to decide the stage among themselves. Just as they passed under the red kite indicating to the finish line, and just as Brutt seemed to start his attack for the stage win, the chain on Millar's bicycle snapped, halting the Scot and destroying any chance at a victory for him. An enraged Millar threw his bike over the barricade and, needing to wait for his team car for another, finished 119th on the stage, though he would be credited with the same finishing time as Pérez in fourth. Brutt's attack, which had started just as disaster struck Millar, gave him the stage win. His remaining breakaway mates finished scattered behind him, with the pink jersey group, led home by Paolo Bettini, 31 seconds back.\nStage 6.\n15 May 2008 — Potenza to Peschici, \nThis stage was originally scheduled to be in length. After representatives from the peloton spoke to race officials, voicing concerns over the long transfers from one day's finish town to the next day's start town affording them little time to rest to prepare for such a demanding stage, the Circuito del Gargano was eliminated.\nThe resultant course was still quite long, with a bumpy profile that suggested a climber or a sprinter who could climb better than his peers would be the day's winner.\nFor the first hour, the peloton stayed together, with no breakaway attempts succeeding. On the ascent to and descent from the day's one categorized climb, at the mark, a twelve-rider breakaway formed, from which would come the riders who contested the stage victory. This group comprised Rene Mandri, Alan Pérez, Paul Martens, Nikolay Trusov, Jason McCartney, Magnus Bäckstedt, Daniele Nardello, Giovanni Visconti, Francesco Gavazzi, Matthias Russ, Maxim Iglinsky, and Matteo Priamo. Before the finish, Mandri was felled by a crash, and had to leave the race.\nThe peloton let this group get a lead of 16 minutes with left to race, before set to making the chase, but it was much too late to bring them back. The race lead was assured to transfer to one in the breakaway. Russ was the best-placed rider in the General Classification at the beginning of the day, but Visconti was only 13 seconds behind him, meaning their respective finishing positions would likely determine which of them got the next pink jersey.\nPriamo and Pérez attacked their breakaway mates in the stage's final kilometer, quickly getting an appreciable gap over them. Bäckstedt tried to follow, but much like his teammate David Millar had had the previous day, mechanical trouble kept him from following. Priamo opened the sprint first and Pérez had no answer, giving the stage win to the Italian.\nVisconti finished the stage 7 seconds ahead of Russ, but he had also won the day's intermediate sprint, which afforded 6 bonus seconds. This gave him the pink jersey over Russ by a margin of less than one second. He was also awarded the white jersey after the stage, as he was a few days under the age limit for that classification. Visconti went à bloc in the stage's final few hundred meters, and had to be held upright by team staff after dismounting his bicycle. The peloton, led home by Daniele Bennati, finished 11'34\" behind the stage winner.\nPriamo's teammate Emanuele Sella, after later testing positive for methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (better known as Mircera, an erythropoietin derivative) at an out-of-competition control run by the UCI and confessing to his doping, named Priamo as his supplier, resulting in a four-year ban for Priamo a year later and casting considerable doubt on the legitimacy of this performance.\nStage 7.\n16 May 2008 — Vasto to Pescocostanzo, \nThis was the first time the Giro ever visited Pescocostanzo, in the region of Abruzzo. The course favored a strong climber, as it featured numerous uncategorized rises in elevation in the first and then two categorized climbs later, as well as an uphill finish.\nIt took for the significant breakaway of this stage to form, after several attempts proved unsuccessful and a second selection took place among two large groups that briefly got away. The seven riders out front for the bulk of the stage were Emanuele Sella, Joan Horrach, Fortunato Baliani, Simon Špilak, Félix Cárdenas, Gabriele Bosisio and Vasil Kiryienka, who had been the original instigator of the breakaway. Numerous splits occurred among this group and the 32-strong group between them and the pink jersey's peloton, with time gaps and exact makeups of each group varying wildly as the stage went on.\nThe stage win went to Bosisio, reaching the finish line 46 seconds ahead of Kiryienka and over a minute ahead of his fellow breakaway mates. His team had wanted to try to have their leader Danilo Di Luca take the stage win, as Di Luca is from the area where the stage ended. But when Bosisio seemed to be in a winning breakaway and informed his teammates that he had the legs to try for the stage win, the team changed their plans. The race's overall contenders, who had been in the second group on the road, closed the gap to the breakaway as the stage ended, and finished just over two minutes behind Bosisio. Another large group was led home by Davide Rebellin 2'55\" back, with most of the other riders finishing alone or in pairs between that group and two large \"gruppetto\" 24 and 28 minutes back. Race leader Giovanni Visconti finished 29th, 3'52\" behind the stage winners and conceding nearly two minutes to the top GC riders, but he had more than enough time in hand to retain the pink jersey.\nStage 8.\n17 May 2008 — Rivisondoli to Tivoli, \nThis was a difficult stage, featuring the second-category Forca d'Acero climb at the mark, and numerous uncategorized climbs later in the stage. Analysis of the course expected it to favor a \"puncheur\", a rider who is not necessarily a pure climber, but one who can put in repeated attacks on courses with such a jagged profile. Speculations for stage winner included Davide Rebellin, Paolo Bettini, and Riccardo Riccò, who went on to contest the finish in a sprint.\nIt was at the mark, on the ascent of the Forca d'Acero, that Alessandro Spezialetti, Mathieu Perget, Fortunato Baliani, and Adam Hansen broke free of the peloton. Their maximum advantage hovered between five and six minutes for most of the time they were away. At the mark, a crash brought down pre-race favorite Alberto Contador, his teammate Steve Morabito, Nicolas Hartmann, and Lander Aperribay. Initially all continued, but Morabito later retired from the Giro, as he had already sustained injuries from a crash earlier in the race.\nAfter the intermediate sprint at the mark, the Quick-Step-led peloton set to making the chase in earnest. This was both to protect race leader Giovanni Visconti and to try to get Paolo Bettini in position for a stage win, as the stage's uphill finish favored him. With left, the gap from the leaders to the pink jersey peloton was below one minute, prompting Hansen to try a solo escape for the stage victory. He attained thirty seconds advantage quickly, as the other four were caught by the peloton, but Hansen too was caught with some left. A 39-rider group contested a final sprint finish, won by Riccardo Riccò. The win was Riccò's second stage victory of this Giro, and gave him leadership in the points classification after the stage. Visconti finished with the leaders and retained the pink jersey.\nStage 9.\n18 May 2008 — Civitavecchia to San Vincenzo, \nThis was a fairly straightforward stage that would almost assuredly end in a mass sprint. The course featured one small categorized climb, but it was no hindrance to the fast men being together at the finish.\nTwo riders broke free of the peloton almost immediately after the stage began; these were Mickaël Buffaz and Yuriy Krivtsov. They attained a maximum advantage of over 11 minutes, but the peloton had no trouble catching them, as they did with some left to race. At that point, Paolo Bettini, Emanuele Sella, and Riccardo Riccò broke away. Though those three did attain a small gap, it was clear that the peloton, paced by in the stage's final kilometers, would not allow any finish but a group sprint, so they dropped back. After Oscar Gatto opened the sprint from the finish line, Daniele Bennati, Bettini, Robbie McEwen, and Erik Zabel came around him to finish the stage in that order. Bennati regained the lead in the points classification from Riccò with the victory.\nStage 10.\n20 May 2008 — Pesaro to Urbino, (individual time trial)\nThe Giro's first individual time trial (ITT), which took place after the Giro's first rest day, featured a course that favored specialists in the discipline. Its first half was flat. The second half included the Monte di Colbordolo, which featured a maximum gradient of 12%, but was otherwise not imposing.\nThe early time to beat was set by 's Tony Martin, who clocked in at 58'54\", one of the first to stop the clock in under an hour. rider Vasil Kiryienka, who had featured in several breakaways in past stages, passed many riders who started minutes before him, but faded toward the finish and ended up 10 seconds slower than Martin. The first rider to best Martin's time was from , who were expected to excel in the ITT as they had several strong time trialists on their squad. This was Vladimir Gusev, who posted a time of 58'46\". Italian national time trial champion Marco Pinotti of Team High Road quickly knocked off Gusev, finishing the course in 57'17\". Shortly after Pinotti finished, Astana's Andreas Klöden and 's Marzio Bruseghin were setting new best times at the intermediate time checks, with Bruseghin stopping the clock at 56'41\", which held up for the stage win by a margin of 20 seconds over Klöden and 8 over Klöden's teammate and team leader Alberto Contador. Contador's performance moved him from eighth to fourth in the overall classification after the stage. The last two men on course were Matthias Russ and race leader Giovanni Visconti, still in high positions because of their Stage 6 breakaway. Visconti passed Russ on the road at one point, and gained nearly three minutes over him to extend his overall lead.\nStage 11.\n21 May 2008 — Urbania to Cesena, \nThis was a tough, hilly stage, containing four categorized climbs, including the first-category Monte Carpegna at the mark. This mountainous stage concluded with an finishing circuit in the hometown of Italian cycling legend Marco Pantani.\nThis day of racing was marked by a consistent downpour of rain, making the course treacherous. At the mark, a break formed, comprising Laurent Mangel, Pablo Lastras, Tiziano Dall'Antonia, Jussi Veikkanen, and Alessandro Bertolini. Their maximum advantage was over nine minutes, though for the second hour of racing their speed was only , as the rain and the hilly terrain made for slow going.\nThe breakaway's lead fell more precipitously on the ascent to Monte Carpegna, as an attempted breakaway from Danilo Di Luca and other overall favorites increased the speed of the chase group for a time. At the top of Monte Carpegna, the leaders had five minutes on the main chase group of overall favorites, and seven and a half minutes on race leader Giovanni Visconti.\nThe rainy descent proved dangerous, as Bertolini and Dall'Antonia both crashed at the mark, but were able to make it back to the leading group. Further crashes elsewhere resulted in Mauricio Ardila, Christian Pfannberger, Leonardo Piepoli, Levi Leipheimer, Visconti, and Emanuele Sella all taking a tumble. Gabriele Bosisio was almost able to make the bridge from the chase to the leaders, and as such was the \"virtual\" race leader for a short while, but after crashing he was forced to rejoin the chase pack. Fortunato Baliani, who had been with Bosisio in the bridge attempt, made it to the leaders after a further solo effort. Lastras tried four or five different times to attack the leading group and get free, but he was never able to do so.\nVeikkanen and Mangel were dropped by the other four leaders on the last climb of the day, and Bertolini, Lastras, Dall'Antonia, and Baliani were poised to contest a stage finish among themselves. Dall'Antonia ended up crashing in the final few kilometers, and was unable to bridge back to the other three. Baliani lost his balance on the course's last left-hand turn, momentarily disturbing Lastras behind him. This allowed Bertolini, who had been leading out the sprint (ordinarily the least advantageous position in a sprint finish), to claim the first Giro stage win of his sixteen-year career. As the Visconti group was able to finish with the Di Luca group after being two to three minutes behind them for most of the day, the young Italian retained the race lead for another day."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 1964 Summer Olympics took place between October 11 and 13. There were 34 competitors from 21 nations, with each nation having up to 3 swimmers. The medals were swept by the United States, with Jed Graef, Gary Dilley, and Bob Bennett taking gold, silver, and bronze respectively.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nAs there were 64 years between the prior edition of this event and this one, no swimmers returned from the 1900 Games. Reigning Olympic champion Ernst Hoppenberg had died in 1937. The American team was so strong that the world record holder, Tom Stock, did not make the team.\n16 nations made their debut in the event, while 5 returned from the 1900 Games. Sweden was the only nation that had competed in the event in 1900 that did not compete again in 1964, other than Germany (now competing as the United Team of Germany).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 9 heats of 7 or 8 swimmers each. The top 24 swimmers advanced to the semifinals. There were 3 semifinals of 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1964 Summer Olympics.\nThe Olympic record was 64 years old, as the event had not been held since the 1900 Games. In the first heat, Bob Bennett broke the record by over 30 seconds, swimming an unrushed 2:16.1. The Olympic record continued to drop throughout the heats and semifinals (with only one of the 7 races in the first two rounds not resulting the record being broken). Shigeo Fukushima swam 2:14.7 in heat 2, Jed Graef 2:14.5 in heat 3, Gary Dilley 2:14.2 in heat 5, Dilley 2:13.8 in semifinal 1, and Graef 2:13.7 in semifinal 2. In the final, Graef and Dilley both broke the world record; the former took gold and the new record with 2:10.3.\nResults.\nHeats.\nFive heats were held; the fastest sixteen swimmers advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nTwo heats were held; the fastest eight swimmers advanced to the final."

        "text": "Australian Sailing magazine (ASL) was published by Yaffa Publishing Group, an independent publisher headquartered in Surry Hills (NSW). Founded in 1976, it was Australia's only dedicated yacht racing magazine.\nOverview.\nThe readership included owners and crew of the 100 ft maxis, keelboat racers, dinghy and sailboard racers.\nHistory.\nAustralian Sailing was founded by Bob Ross and Ken McLachlan in September 1976. Ross came from a newspaper background and entered boating journalism via Modern Boating magazine. McLachlan was an advertising salesman.\nA New Zealander by birth, Ross spent his early years in the Finn dinghy, in which he competed for Olympic selection in 1964 and 1968. He also raced competitively in J24s and offshore events including the Sydney-Hobart, winning the 1986 Sydney-Mooloolaba race as co-helmsman aboard Nuzulu.\nIn 1996 he won the Robert Greaves Achievement Award which recognises outstanding contributions to the boating industry. He wasn't able to attend the award ceremony because he was covering yachting at the Olympic Games at the time. He has covered every major world yachting event, including every America's Cup since 1962, Admirals Cups and Olympic sailing.\nIn 1986 Ross and McLachlan sold the magazine to Yaffa Publishing, a privately held company which publishes business-to-business and specialist consumer magazines from its Surry Hills (NSW) base.\nRoss remained editor of Sailing until December 2003, when he handed over to Vanessa Dudley. One of the first women to compete against the men in 18 ft skiffs, as skipper of Nutrimetics, Dudley also had credentials in dinghy and offshore racing. She has completed 15 Sydney to Hobart races. Dudley was editor of Australian Sailing until June 2009.\nIn 2009, during the height of the Global Financial Crisis, the frequency was reduced from monthly to eight issues a year. During the winter months the publication came out every second month.\nRoger McMillan was editor from July 2009 until November 2013. McMillan began his journalism career and his interest in sailing in New Zealand, where he cruised a small Spencer-designed keelboat offshore from Auckland. Moving to Australia in 1986 he built a 37 ft Van de Stadt and sailed it short-handed and solo from Western Australia to Sydney via Cape Leeuwin, the Great Australian Bight and the Bass Strait.\nIn November 2013 Roger McMillan was replaced by Kimberley Wilmot as editor of the magazine and the frequency of the magazine reduced to six issues per year.\nNotable Contributors.\nDavid Dellenbaugh was tactician aboard the 1992 America's Cup winning boat America Cubed and publishes a bi-monthly newsletter specialising in yacht racing tactics.\nTony Bull is a sailmaker and offshore racing consultant who provides a monthly column on faster sailing.\nAndrew Verdon is the strength and conditioning coach for the Australian Sailing Team. His column offers advice on preparation for race days.\nWill Oxley is a racing navigator who has completed more than 200,000 nm of ocean miles including three round the world races and 11 Sydney to Hobart races. Most recently he provided navigation and weather support for Puma in the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race.\nBob Ross is the founding editor of Australian Sailing and contributed a monthly article on a variety of subjects from practical issues such as hull preparation and sailcloth to profiles of sailors.\nVanessa Dudley is also a former editor of the magazine and is a World Masters Laser Radial Gold Medallist. She has helmed 18 ft skiffs, completed 15 Sydney to Hobart races and written about all major yacht races including the Olympic Games. Dudley contributes a monthly Masterclass, concentrating on preparation and racing in off-the-beach classes."

        "text": "The inaugural Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France, from 25 January to 4 February 1924. A total of 258 athletes from 16 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 16 events across 9 disciplines. Women also participated in these Games, although the only events they were allowed to compete in were the figure skating ladies' singles and pairs. When the Games were held, they were not recognized as the Winter Olympics but as a winter sports week festival. It was not until 1926 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially recognized them as the first Winter Olympics.\n104 athletes won medals for their NOCs, but the athletes from Norway and Finland stood out and dominated the Games, winning 17 and 11 medals, respectively. The United States and Great Britain tied for third place in the total number of medals, with four each. Athletes from 10 of the 16 participating NOCs won at least one medal; eight won at least one gold medal. Many of the athletes who won these medals had already returned to their home countries by the time the medals were awarded, on 5 February, and other participants from their countries had to take the medals to the winning athletes.\nFinnish speed skater Clas Thunberg topped the medal count with five medals: three golds, one silver, and one bronze. One of his competitors, Roald Larsen of Norway, also won five medals, with two silver and three bronze medal-winning performances. The first gold medalist at these Games—and therefore the first gold medalist in Winter Olympic history—was American speed skater Charles Jewtraw. Only one medal change occured after the Games: in the ski jump competition, a marking error deprived American athlete Anders Haugen of a bronze medal. Haugen pursued an appeal to the IOC many years after the fact; he was awarded the medal after a 1974 decision in his favor.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes who won multiple medals are listed below."

The ninth-ranked Michigan Wolverines, champions of the Big Ten Conference, defeated the California Golden Bears, champions of the Pacific Coast Conference, 14–6.\nMichigan fullback Don Dufek scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter and was named the Player of the Game. With a record of 9–0–1, the Golden Bears were ranked fourth in the nation.\nIt was the Big Ten's fifth consecutive win in the Rose Bowl, and California's third straight loss.\nTeams.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nMichigan upset rival Ohio State 9–3 in the notorious Snow Bowl game, played in of snow in Columbus.\nCalifornia Golden Bears.\nThis was California's third consecutive trip to the Rose Bowl and were slightly favored. Pete Schabarum broke a 77-yard run on the second play of the game, but a backfield-in-motion penalty nullified the score to stop the Cal momentum.\nAftermath.\nAfter this third consecutive loss by California, the Pacific Coast Conference enacted a \"no-repeat\" rule, similar to the Big Ten's. Future teams affected were UCLA in 1955 and Oregon State in 1958, and both resulted in wins for the Big Ten. With the PCC's dissolution in the spring of 1959, the succeeding AAWU (Big Five) abolished that rule, and Washington won the next two Rose Bowls in 1960 and 1961.\nAlthough Minnesota appeared in consecutive Rose Bowls in 1961 and 1962, (both as \"at-large\" invitations, the latter after champion Ohio State declined), the Big Ten kept its rule until the early 1970s; the last team affected was Michigan State in 1967, when runner-up Purdue edged unranked USC by a point. The first Big Ten team to make a repeat appearance in the 1970s was Ohio State in 1974, the conference's only win in Pasadena that decade."

        "text": "Sydney Uni Baseball Club (SUBC) is an Australian baseball club that was established in , making it one of the oldest sporting clubs in Australia.\nSydney Uni Baseball Club is a part of Sydney University Sport and Fitness, an organisation whose history dates back to 1852. Sydney Uni Sport &amp; Fitness has produced more Australian representatives and won more major competitions than any other club.\nThe History of Sydney Uni Baseball Club.\nThe NSW baseball competition was established in , and the club's affiliation was made and the club constituted in .\nFoundation years.\nDetails of the club's first game are not known, but the second game was played against Waverley, formed in 1898. The Club was formed to give cricketers who did not play football or row a way to keep fit in the winter months. The first President was the registrar H.E. Barff, secretary was Dr J.S. Harris, the prime mover in the formation of the club, and treasurer was G.T. Balcombe.\nIn the inaugural season, the team was entered in the second grade of NSW Baseball Association (NSWBA), and won 10 from 12 games. The club played home games on Rushcutters Bay Oval, and trained twice a week on The Square at Sydney University.\nIn 1907, A.D. Watson was selected to represent Australia against the representatives of the American Fleet. In 1911, F.E. McElhone, A.D. Watson and C.V. Single represented NSW in all three games against Victoria, while R. Campling and F.M. Farrar represented NSW against Tasmania.\nWhile most other clubs in the University suspended participation in competitions during World War I, the baseball club was an exception and continued playing. In 1916, playing its home games on the University Oval, the club won its first championship by winning the first grade district championship and hence the Proud Shield, by defeating Petersham 12-7 in the final.\n1920s.\n1923 proved to be an important year for the Club for two reasons. First, the club played its first inter-varsity match, sending a team to play Adelaide University and secondly, it was the first time since its inception that the Club fielded three teams in the NSWBA. In 1926 there was a triangular series held between Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne universities. Sydney took out the series undefeated and managed to do the same the following year.\nIn 1927, Jack Mould - the first grade captain at the time, who the Club MVP trophy is now named after - was chosen to captain NSW. He has a Blue for baseball, and was later patron of the club from 1941 to 1983. Mould was associated with the Club for over 60 years as a player, administrator and coach.\nIn 1928 Sydney Uni engaged in the first international University match in Australia, playing Stanford University. The tourists defeated Sydney 5-2. Stanford then played a combined Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide team, defeating the Australians 31-6.\n1950s and 1960s.\nAlso in 1962, Jeffrey, A. Alderson and F. Hampshire were selected to compete for NSW in the Claxton Shield in Perth. In 1966, the club participated in the inter-varsity competition held in Sydney. Seven universities contested, with all games being played on the two ovals. Sydney was undefeated, and won the Hugh J. Ward Cup for the first time since 1957.\n1970s.\n1973 was one of the most successful years for the club. Under the presidency of Alan Compton, the Club won both the first grade premiership and intervarsity. Overall the club was first grade premier, first grade pennant winner (minor premiers), joint club champion (with Mosman) and intervarsity Champion, while Ian Anderson received the Fred Bachall trophy for NSW 'player of the year' for the second straight year. Ron Finlay, the former chairman of the Australian Baseball Federation, was declared MVP for the intervarsity tournament.\nModern era.\nContinuing participation in the Sydney Winter Baseball League (SWBL) into the new millennium, premierships were sporadic in the 2000s. Early on in the 2010s, the club's longstanding home ground, Oval 2 at Sydney University, underwent significant infrastructure changes, forcing the club off campus for the first time. This coincided with an increase in grade premierships through the 2010s, particularly in third grade.

        "text": "The South West Rugby League (SWRL) also known as the \"South West Men's League\", is a rugby league competition for teams in the South West of England. It was formerly part of the Rugby League Conference.\nThe SWRL is a semi-autonomous league with a five-member committee under an Rugby Football League (RFL) appointed chairman. The SWRL has five member clubs from Devon and Cornwall.\nHistory.\nThe Rugby League Conference was founded in 1997 as the \"Southern Conference\", a 10-team pilot league for teams in the South of England and the English Midlands.\nThe conference made the leap from 30 to 52 teams in 2003 and a South West Division appeared for the first time. It disappeared in 2004 as South West teams took part in the Western Division and Cardiff Demons joined the newly created Welsh Division.\nThe Premier divisions saw a change in boundaries leaving the North Premier division covering a larger area to give the English Midlands clubs their own premier division without having to face heartland teams, this left the West Midlands division with too few teams to run, resulting in a merged West Midlands and South West Division.\nAfter a campaign by the RFL to form new clubs in the South West, a new South West division was created in 2007 for teams from the West Country. By 2010, there were enough teams to have a South West conference split into two pools.\nFor the 2011 season, there was a new RLC West of England alongside the RLC South West. The initial idea was that the two leagues would compete side by side with play-offs at the end of the season to decide an overall South West champion. In 2011, Gloucestershire Warriors defeated Somerset Vikings in the Championship play-off. In 2012, the intended play-off match was cancelled as the majority of the Devon Sharks team, the South West Champions, were unable to break off from the start of the rugby union season to fulfil the fixture.\nThe South Western Rugby League was formed in February 2013 to organise and administer the South West Men's League following the switch of the majority of community clubs in England to a summer season and the ending of the Rugby League Conference in 2011.\nRugby League Conference Pyramid.\nThis is officially the highest tier 4 league that South West clubs can play in.\nSouth West Cup.\nThe South West cup is a knock-out competition played for by members of the South West Division. It was originally known as the Devon Cup.\nSouth West Nines.\nThe South West Nines is a rugby league nines competition. It is competed for by RLC South West and RLC West of England teams and local student rugby league sides.\nCounty Challenge.\nIn 2010, a ″one–off″ match was played between Devon and Cornwall with Devon winning 44–20. The match was featured on the BBC national news and was widely covered by the rugby league press. It is now competed for annually and known as the Martin Roddy MBE Trophy.\nSouth West County Championship Festival.\nThe first South West County Championship took place on the May Bank Holiday weekend in 2011 at Aretians RFC in Bristol. The 2012 Event took place at Bridgwater RFC in Somerset."

        "title": "Rugby league match officials",
        "text": " \nRugby league match officials are responsible for fairly enforcing the \"Laws of the Game\" from a neutral point of view during a match of rugby league football and imposing penalties for deliberate breaches of these Laws. The most senior match official is the \"referee\". They may be assisted by a range of other officials depending on the level and rules of the competition.\nEquipment.\nThe match officials may use the following equipment:\nUniform.\nMatch officials on the playing field including the referee, touch judges and in-goal judges all wear an official uniform of a colour distinguishable from those being worn by the two sides playing each other. These uniforms have no special markings to signify the official capacity of the wearer, instead this can be identified by the positioning and equipment of the official.\nRefereeing systems.\nDifferent refereeing systems are in use:\nPositions and responsibilities.\nReferee.\nThe players of each team should be made available for kit inspection. The referee inspects the playing kit of the two teams to ensure it is within the rules, safety is the main concern. The boots worn by players can be of particular interest so as to make sure that there are no sharp edges. The strapping worn by some players has also been scrutinised.\nThe referee organises a coin toss with the captains of the two teams playing to decide which team kicks off and which end they play at from kick-off.\nReferees may take disciplinary action from the moment they enter the playing field until the moment they leave it after they have blown their whistle to signal full-time. The referee may blow for half time and full-time when those periods have elapsed, or after hearing the hooter if responsibility has been delegated.\nPotential top level referees must first pass refereeing exams set by a governing body, such as the Rugby Football League in the United Kingdom, before officiating at progressively more senior levels of the sport, gaining experience in amateur competitions and then moving onto the professional leagues where they will progress to the top if good enough. Referees need to be \"very fit\", with physical training being a requirement at a professional level of competition. Good communication skills, an ability to \"handle top athletes with respect and authority\" and being able to operate under pressure and scrutiny have been cited as by Stuart Cummings, a former referee, as skills needed to control a game.\nFull-time referees have been used in the Super League professional competition since 2007.\nReferee's signals.\nThe referee having made a decision should indicate that decision by using a signal.\nTouch judge.\nTwo touch judges are used in a rugby league game. They move along each touch line following play. Their main function is to judge when the ball or a player carrying the ball has gone into touch. They also stand together behind the goal posts to judge whether conversions or penalty kicks at goal have been successful.\nTouch judges' signals.\nThe touch judges cannot stop play but can signal the referee to enable them to assist the referee.\nVideo referee.\nThe video referee may be called upon by the referee to examine the play in possible tries. In the Super League competition they can examine play from the preceding play-the-ball. A video referee may also be asked to check whether an attempted 40-20 kick has been successful and sometimes called upon by the referee if there is a stoppage to check events before making a decision. Once a decision has been made by the on field referee, the video referee may not overrule it.\nThe video referee was first seen in Australia at the 1996 Super League World Nines. The use of the video referee has led to new rule interpretations. In Northern Hemisphere competitions, the video referee is stationed at the ground itself, usually in either the TV production truck or a special booth inside the stadium, while in the NRL a group of video referees make decisions on all matches from \"The Bunker\", a specially-constructed facility near league headquarters in Sydney modeled after similar instant-replay rooms used by American sports leagues like MLB or the NHL.\nIn-goal judge.\nIn-goal judges may be used if no video referee system is present at a match to assist the referee in his decision making.\nTimekeeper.\nThe referee shall keep the time during a game unless this responsibility is delegated to an appointed official. Delegation of responsibility is usually decided by the rules of a competition, it is standard practice for professional competitions to use an appointed official in place of the referee.\nThe British Rugby Football League's Operational Rules, for example, require the home team to provide a timekeeper for first team games with the away team being entitled to bring their own to sit alongside their opponent's representative. The timekeepers signal half time and full-time as well as extra time periods if they are played. When time has expired the timekeepers sound the hooter, at this signal the referee will blow his whistle to end play at an existing stoppage or wait for the next one to occur.\nA referee can signal by raising both arms to a timekeeper to take account of stoppage time and to stop their watch until signalled again by waving one arm above their head to carry on timing.\nA timekeeper may be used to assist the referee in timing the temporary suspension (sin bin) of a player.\nMatch Commissioner.\nThe Match Commissioner is responsible for the whole game. They ensure the game kicks off on time and any incidents that may arise are brought to the attention of the Rugby Football League.\nThis is an essential role as it allows the game to run consistently without any interruptions\nInterchange Official.\nThe Interchange Official ensures that the interchange process is carried out smoothly and legally. No interchange can take place without the Interchange Official present. Usually, the Interchange Official will be responsible for the home team's interchange and the Reserve Referee/Official will be responsible for the away team's interchange."

        "text": "The men's normal hill individual ski jumping competition for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada was held on 12 and 13 February 2010 at Whistler Olympic Park in Whistler, British Columbia. It was the first medal event of the 2010 Games.\nSixty-one athletes took part in the qualifying round of the competition, from which 50 athletes advanced to the two competition rounds. Swiss athlete Simon Ammann had the longest jumps in both competition rounds, winning the gold medal. The silver medal was won by Polish jumper Adam Małysz who had the third best results in both the first and second competition rounds. German jumper Michael Uhrmann was in second place following the first jump, but did poorly on his second jump and ended up fifth in the overall standings. Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria moved up from seventh place to win the bronze medal after jumping a full longer on his second attempt.\nBackground.\nThe men's normal hill individual ski jumping competition for the 2010 Winter Olympics was held on 12 and 13 February 2010 at Whistler Olympic Park in Whistler, British Columbia. It was the first medal event of the 2010 Games.\nA normal hill in ski jumping is defined as a jump in which the width of the hill ranges from to . Skiers ski down a sloped ramp, which then turns flat into a takeoff jump, and complete their jump on a landing slope. The rules of international ski jumping competitions, set by the governing body for ski jumping, the Fédération Internationale de Ski, award points based on two factors: distance and judge's score. Distance is measured from the edge of the takeoff ramp to the point where the jumper first touches the landing slope. The three judges are able to award up to 20 points each, for a total of 60 points. The judge's scores are based on a variety of factors including the timing of the takeoff, the skier's ability to carry out the movements involved in the jump, and their stability in the air.\nThe field.\nAllocation of slots in the Olympic ski jumping competition was based upon the World Ranking List (WRL) consisting of Ski Jumping World Cup and Grand Prix points, followed by Continental Cup Standings from the 2008-09 and 2009-10 Ski Jumping World Cup, with no nation being allowed more than five skiers.\nNorway's Lars Bystøl was the defending Olympic champion on the normal hill, but he retired after the 2007-08 season and therefore did not participate in the 2010 Games. However, The 2006 large hill gold medalist, Austrian Thomas Morgenstern was present. Morgenstern had won the last scheduled normal hill event of the World Cup (on 14 December 2007 in Villach, Austria), and was expected to be among the strongest competitors in the event. The last World Cup event in this discipline took place on 8 March 2009 at Lahti, Finland (though it was originally scheduled to be a large hill event) and was won by Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria. Although a relative newcomer to the sport, having only started competing in 2005-06, Schlierenzauer entered the competition with thirty-five World Cup victories under his belt.\nOther competitors expected to finish strongly included Poland's Adam Małysz and Finland's Janne Ahonen, the latter of whom had come out of retirement in hopes of winning an Olympic medal. Simon Ammann, who had won gold medals in both normal and large hill competitions at the 2002 Winter Olympics but failed to medal in 2006, was expected to be a strong competitor as well. Wolfgang Loitzl of Austria was the defending world champion.\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying round for the men's normal hill individual event took place on 12 February with a trial qualification at 09:00 PST and a qualification round at 10:00 PST the same day. Sixty-one athletes participated in the qualification round, with ten pre-qualified, including all four athletes from Austria. The forty athletes with the highest scores advanced to the medal round on 13 February, joining the ten pre-qualified jumpers.\nRoberto Dellasega of Italy was disqualified, and therefore excluded from any opportunity to advance. Norway's Anders Jacobsen did not show, but because he was pre-qualified he advanced to the competition round anyway. The top finisher in the qualifying round was Michael Uhrmann of Germany. His countryman Michael Neumayer had the second-longest jump but placed third to Czech jumper Jakub Janda because of Janda's higher judge's score. All four jumpers from the host country of Canada failed to qualify.\nCompetition Rounds.\nThe final competition, consisting of two jumps, took place on 13 February. The top thirty jumpers after the first jump qualified for the second jump. The combined total points over the two jumps was used to determine the final ranking. A practice round took place at 08:30 PST, with the first and second rounds of the event taking place at 09:45 PST and 10:45 PST respectively.\nSimon Ammann of Switzerland landed the longest distance in the first jump, 105 meters. Following the first jump, Michael Uhrmann of Germany was the second-placed jumper, followed by Adam Małysz of Poland. Austrian jumper Thomas Morgenstern was just outside of the medal positions in fourth place, whereas his countryman Gregor Schlierenzauer, was 7.5 points behind and in seventh place. Harri Olli of Finland had a 97.5 meters jump with 116.0 points, and would have been eligible to jump in the final round, but was disqualified.\nIn the second jump, Ammann again landed the longest jump, reaching a distance of 108 meters. After Ammann landed the jump, he immediately began pumping his arms in the air, confident that he had secured the gold medal. Uhrmann, second after the first round, was one of the few competitors who had a shorter jump in the final round, placing tenth in the final round and fifth overall. Among the jumpers who surpassed him was Adam Małysz, who again took third place in the final round and finished in second overall, winning the silver medal. The bronze was won by Gregor Schlierenzauer, whose significantly better performance in the final round netted him second place for the round and third overall. Schlierenzauer's second jump was a full five meters longer than his first, the single largest improvement between the two rounds by any competitor. Uhrmann's fifth-place finish was the top result by an athlete not pre-qualified for the competition round. "

He played representative rugby union (RU) for England and Yorkshire, and at club level for Morley R.F.C., as a fly-half, i.e. number 10, and representative level rugby league (RL) for England and Yorkshire, and at club level for Bradford F.C. (now Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.) (captain), as a , i.e. number 6.\nBackground.\nGeorge Marsden was born in Morley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He died on 7 July 1948 in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, England.\nPlaying career.\nInternational honours.\nGeorge Marsden won caps for England (RU) while at Morley R.F.C. in the 1900 Home Nations Championship against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and won a cap for England (RL) while at Bradford F.C. in 1905 against Other Nationalities.\nCounty honours.\nGeorge Marsden won 11-caps for Yorkshire (RU) while at Morley R.F.C. up to and including 1900, and won cap(s) for Yorkshire (RL) while at Bradford between 1900 and 1906.\nWhen Bradford converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on 29 August 1895, George Marsden would have been 14 years of age.

        "text": "The modern World Series, the current championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) between teams of the National League and the American League, began in 1903, and was established as an annual event in 1905. This article discusses major-league champions before 1905, including championship series contested in that era, primarily between teams of the National League and the American Association.\nHistory.\nBefore the formation of the American Association (AA), which debuted in 1882, there were no playoff rounds—all championships went to the team with the best record at the end of the season.\nIn the initial season of the National League (NL) in 1876, there was controversy as to which team was the champion: the Chicago White Stockings, who had the best overall record (52–14), or the St. Louis Brown Stockings (45–19), who were the only team to have a winning record against every other franchise in the league. The teams agreed to play a five-game \"Championship of the West\" series, won by St. Louis, four games to one.\nNational League and American Association, 1882–1891.\nBeginning with an exhibition series after the American Association's birth in 1882, a championship series between the NL and AA regular-season champions was promoted and referred to as the \"World's Championship Series\" (WCS), or \"World's Series\" for short; however, these series are not officially recognized by Major League Baseball as part of World Series history. Though early publications, such as Ernest Lanigan's \"Baseball Cyclopedia\" and Hy Turkin and S. C. Thompson's \"Encyclopedia of Baseball\", listed the 19th-century games on an equal basis with those of the 20th century, \"Sporting News\" publications about the World Series, which began in the 1920s, ignored the 19th-century games, as did most publications about the Series after 1960. MLB, in general, regards 19th-century events as a prologue to the modern era of baseball, with the birth of the present American League in 1901.\nIn the second year of the WCS, a dispute in the 1885 series concerned Game 2, which was forfeited by the St. Louis Browns (AA) to the Chicago White Stockings (NL) when the Browns pulled their team off the field protesting an umpiring decision. The managers, Cap Anson (St. Louis) and Charles Comiskey (Chicago), initially agreed to disregard the game. When St. Louis won the final game and an apparent series championship, three games to two, Chicago owner Albert Spalding overruled his manager and declared that he wanted the forfeit counted. The result of a tied WCS was that neither team got the prize money that had been posted by the owners before the series (and was returned to them after they both agreed it was a tie).\nSeries within the National League, 1892–1900.\nFollowing the collapse of the AA in 1891, four of its clubs (Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Brooklyn) were admitted to the NL. The league championship was awarded in 1892 by a playoff between half-season champions. This scheme was abandoned after one season. Beginning in 1893—and continuing until divisional play was introduced in 1969—the pennant was awarded to the first-place club in the standings at the end of the season. For four seasons, the pennant winner played the runners-up in the postseason championship series called the Temple Cup. A second attempt at this format was the \"Chronicle-Telegraph\" Cup series in 1900.\nChampions before 1876.\nNotes: \nChampions from 1876 to 1904.\nNotes: "

Key contributors included seniors Arinze Onuaku and Andy Rautins, juniors Rick Jackson and Wesley Johnson, sophomores Scoop Jardine and Kris Joseph and freshmen Mookie Jones, DaShonte Riley, James Southerland and Brandon Triche.\nAlthough widely expected to finish near the middle of the league, the Orange captured its eighth Big East regular season title, and second outright, as well as the No. 1 seed in the Big East tournament. The team also achieved its first No. 1 ranking in the national AP Poll since the 1989-90 season, and its first in the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll since winning the national championship in 2003.\nThe Orange failed to win the Big East tournament, falling in the quarterfinals to Georgetown, but their regular season efforts earned them a 1 seed in the West Region of the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. They easily won their first and second-round games over 16 seed Vermont and 8 seed Gonzaga to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they were upset by 5 seed and AP #11 Butler to end the season 30–5.\nPreseason.\nRoster changes.\nSyracuse lost its starting backcourt from the previous season as point guard Jonny Flynn declared for the 2009 NBA draft and was taken with the sixth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Also turning pro were shooting guard Eric Devendorf and small forward Paul Harris. The Orange also lost one scholarship senior, power forward Kristof Ongenaet and one transfer, center Sean Williams.\nAdditions to the team include Iowa State transfer Wes Johnson, who sat out the 2008–09 season because of NCAA transfer rules. Also, point guard Scoop Jardine returns after redshirting due to a stress fracture in his shin. Small forward Mookie Jones also redshirted the previous year because of a hip injury.\nSyracuse also brought in three new players for 2009-10: power forward DaShonte Riley, small forward James Southerland and guard Brandon Triche. Southerland was actually a 2008 recruit, but could not play because he was academically ineligible. He spent a year at a prep school to improve his grades.\nRoster.\nPreseason outlook.\nThe departure of Flynn left many college basketball observers pessimistic about the Orange. In the preseason coaches' poll, Syracuse was predicted to finish sixth in the Big East and were unranked in the preseason AP Poll. Arinze Onuaku was the only Orange player to make the preseason All-Big East team, receiving an honorable mention.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=9| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9| NCAA tournament†"

        "title": "Ricky Ponting with the Australian cricket team in India in 2008–09",
        "text": "Ricky Ponting captained the Australian cricket team on their four Test tour of India in 2008–09. On a tour that was unsuccessful on a whole, the tourists lost the Test series 2–0 to an Indian side led by Anil Kumble and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, while they drew two warm-up matches against the Centre of Excellence (non-first-class match) and Indian Board President's XI. This was Ponting's first full tour of India as captain, after previously being injured for three of the four Tests when Australia last visited in 2004.\nOn previous Test tours of India in 1997–98, 2000–01 and 2004–05, Ponting struggled, especially against the off-spin from Harbhajan Singh, who had dismissed him on eight occasions in Tests. Ponting had only scored 172 runs in eight Tests and 14 innings in India, with a highest of 60—his only half-century in the country—and an average of 12.28, well below his career average of 58.53 prior to the series. However, in 11 home Tests against India, he had averaged 79.35.\nPonting's tour started well, scoring a half-century in the second tour match and a century in the opening Test. However, his performances diminished as his team began to struggle against an experienced Indian outfit. He managed only one other half-century for the series, totaling 266 runs at an average of 38, dropping his overall Test average to 57.58. In the final Test in Nagpur—in which Australia needed victory to level the series—Ponting was criticized for bowling part-time spin bowlers in an effort to increase the over rate, to avoid suspension and a fine. When the fast bowlers were re-introduced, the match was beyond Australia's grasp and India were eventual victors. These tactics were severely criticised in Australia.\nBackground and early tour.\nThe series was the first time Ponting captained the Australians in a full Test series in India. He did not lead the Australian team to victory there in 2004–05 because he missed the first three Tests with injury. Adam Gilchrist took the Australians to a 2–1 victory. Australia, however, lost the fourth and final Test in Mumbai when Ponting returned. Nevertheless, this was Australia's first Test series win in India since 1969–70, in which Ponting made 11 and 12 on a controversial pitch.\nPonting and his team were under pressure leading into the series, following the spiteful confrontations during the Indian tour of Australia earlier in the year. He had also struggled in a previous three Test series during 2001, scoring 17 runs at 3.40. Ponting acknowledged prior to the series that he was keen to rectify his poor Test batting record in India, believed to be because of his weakness against spin bowling. Though, from 1 January 2004 up until the start of the first Test, Ponting scored 1510 runs and an average of 83.88 in 64 innings against spin bowling, thus being the only Australian to score more than 1,300 runs and average over 70.\nFirst Test.\nAustralia headed into the First Test at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore with two previous wins at the venue—in 1998 and 2004—and a draw. Meanwhile, India had not won at the venue since 1995, and had only four victories in 17 attempts—their worst Test win–loss ratio at home venues. \nAustralia won the toss and batted, and Ponting was brought to the middle in the opening over, after Matthew Hayden was caught behind for a duck. He started slowly, scoring two from 17 balls, before driving Ishant Sharma for a boundary. Harbhajan Singh had already sent down 2.3 overs before he delivered his first ball to Ponting in the 17th over. The big screen at the ground flashed, \"Ponting has been dismissed by Harbhajan eight times in Test cricket.\" Nevertheless, Ponting turned the first ball from his nemesis off his pads for a boundary. From then on Ponting increased his strike rate, reaching his half-century in 102 balls, when he hit Zaheer Khan for a boundary through cover. His partnership with Simon Katich ended on 166, when Katich was caught by Dhoni, after lasting more than 54 overs. He and Michael Clarke built on the good start with 60 runs in 24 overs, before Clarke was dismissed. Ponting brought up his century a short while later when cut Kumble through backward point for three. He eventually fell on 126 from 243 balls (13 fours), when he missed a sweep off Harbhajan, reducing Australia to 3/226.\nAfter stumps, with Australia at 4/254, Ponting was happy with his performance, \"I'm as pleased with that innings as I probably have been with any innings I've ever played,\" he said. \"I'd played eight Tests here before with a highest score of 60, so I had some work to do. I had a point to prove to a few people as well. It was satisfying today.\" I've been working really hard,\" Ponting said on his technique. \"I've made no secret of it, my record here has been poor. Today is one step in the right direction. It was nice to get some runs out there and put the team in a good position. But one innings doesn't make a tour. The other tours I've had here, apart from the last Test I played, I've batted at six, always coming in against spin and when the wicket has worn. One thing that stands out in my career is whenever I've been in early, with the team in a bit of trouble, I've managed to make runs.\"\nAustralia were bowled out for 430 shortly after tea on the second day. Michael Hussey scored his ninth Test century before the tourists tail folded. Australia had the hosts seven wickets down in their first innings—still more than 320 runs in arrears—before Harbhajan and Khan combined for an 80 run partnership late on day three.\nIn Australia's second innings, Ponting joined Katich in the 13th over, after Hayden was dismissed. Ponting lasted 34 balls, before he was caught a short mid-wicket from a Sharma slower ball on 17. Beforehand, the Australian captain was \"targeted\" by Harbhajan \"with men crowded around the bat.\" Australia declared on 228 on the final day; however India survived, enforcing a draw.\nSecond Test.\nPrior to the Second Test starting on 17 October in Mohali, Australian opening batsman Phil Jaques (who did not play in the opening Test) was sent home after failing to overcome a back injury. He was replaced in the squad by Shaun Marsh, who opened the batting in the recently concluded One Day Internationals against the West Indies and had been the leading run-scorer in the 2008 Indian Premier League. Victorian fast-bowler Peter Siddle made his international debut, after Stuart Clark injured his elbow. Ponting himself was forced to take anti-inflammatory tablets, after surgery before the series.\nWinning the toss and batting, India reached 5/311 by stumps on the opening day. India were bowled out for 469 on the second day, after Ganguly scored his 16th and last Test century. Hayden was bowled for a third-ball duck, while Ponting was trapped lbw by a Sharma off cutter for five, as Australia collapsed to 5/58 and then 8/144 in their first innings reply. Shane Watson and Brett Lee combined for 73 eight wicket partnership, helping Australia reach a meagre 268. In the home-side's second innings, Ponting was criticised for using part-timers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen after he was informed that he was five overs behind the required over rate, which is penalisable by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant that he was not able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly. A long discussion between Lee and Ponting prompted media allegations of a team rift, something Ponting denied. \"It seems like there are people trying to make a bit more of that than what it actually was,\" Ponting said after his team's defeat. \"I made Brett aware he wasn't going to bowl first-thing in the morning. I let him know we were wanting to take pace off the ball.\" Where it fell down a bit is I didn't communicate those reasons to Brett at 11am when he wanted to bowl. I made it clear to him from that moment on of those reasons.\" After India declared on 3/314 with just over four sessions of play remaining, Australia were bowled out for 195 on the fifth morning, with Ponting's off stump knocked out of the ground by another Sharma off cutter for just 2, as India completed a 320 run victory.\nThird Test.\nThe Third Test in Delhi saw India amass 7/613 in its first innings, while Delhi smog—left over from Diwali festivals—created an unusual atmosphere. Gautam Gambhir and VVS Laxman both scored double centuries—the first time two batsmen have reached 200 in the same Test innings against Australia—and Ponting even resorted to bowling himself for two unsuccessful overs.\nIn reply Australia started strongly, with Ponting having to wait until 123 runs were scored before walking out to bat on the third day. After surviving a spell reverse-swing bowling from Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan, Ponting was bowled through the gate from a sharp turning delivery from part-time off-spinner Virender Sehwag. Ponting and out-of-form opener Matthew Hayden partnered for a cautious 79-run compilation, as both looked to survive on a pitch that was becoming lower and slower. Ponting was more cautious against Sharma than usual, scoring only nine from 26 balls from the tall right-armer quick. Nevertheless, he was more aggressive and assured against spinners Amit Mishra and Sehwag, where he scored 35 from 60 and 17 from 32 deliveries respectively. During the early stage of his innings, a swarm of bees interrupted the match when they forced the players and officials to lie on the ground, before they moved on. After surviving four dropped catches, Michael Clarke scored his eight Test century in Australia's highest Test score in India—577—as Sehwag took a career best five wickets in the absence of fellow spinners Harbhajan Singh and Kumble who left the field with a finger injury. India lost two late Indian wickets on the fourth evening and were reduced to 4/93 on the fifth morning; however the match ended in a tame draw, with the home side declaring on 5/208, setting Australia an unrealistic target of 245 in the final session. They finished on 31 without loss, before the match was declared a draw, resulting in Australia needing victory in the final Test to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\nFourth Test.\nWith Australia needing to win the Fourth Test, Jason Krejza was selected for his Australian debut. The match was played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Nagpur, which was making its debut as an international venue. Previous matches in the city were played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground and both teams were unsure how the pitch would play, as the match was also the first first-class match to be played at the stadium. Nevertheless, Ponting described said the pitch was grassless and hard as concrete. Ponting understood the importance of the match, \"This is probably as big a Test match as a lot of us have played.\" He said. \"Being 1–0 down with a match to play is a position that a lot of us haven't been in before. We pride ourselves on playing well in big games, and this is certainly a big game for us. There is a great opportunity for us to stand up, and play better cricket than we've played in the first three Test matches.\" Throughout the first three Tests, Australian bowlers struggled to take wickets, managing 38 wickets at an average of 53.61.\nAfter losing the toss, Australia were sent into field. Their bowling attack again struggled to be effective, with Sachin Tendulkar scoring his 40th Test century (10th against Australia) and VVS Laxman compiling a slow 64. The only highlight for the Australian was Krejza's 8/215 from 43.5 overs, as India amassed 445. The off-spinners figures was the second best by an Australian on debut in Test history. Matthew Hayden and Simon Katich started quickly for Australia, reaching 32 in the seventh over, before Hayden was run-out. Ponting played freely, scoring 11 runs from the final three balls of an Ishant Sharma over. However, in the following over he was clean bowled for 24 (41 balls) by a Harbhajan Singh delivery that spun and left him cramped for room while trying to cut. This was the tenth occasion he had been dismissed by Harbhajan in Tests.\nOn the fourth afternoon of the Fourth Test, the Indian batting collapsed, and Australia had an opportunity to bowl them out and chase a target of around 250–300 after the tea break. However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate, so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke, Cameron White and Mike Hussey (who were all unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), as they took less time. In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers, who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up. When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly. This left Australia with 382 runs for victory and Ponting fell cheaply after attempting to take a quick single down the ground and being run out by a direct hit from Mishra at the non-striker's end. Australia lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2–0. In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan's 300th Test wicket. He ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71. While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India.\nPonting escaped without suspension for slow over rates, although he received a fine. Nevertheless, he failed to redress the matter during the subsequent home series against New Zealand, when match referee Chris Broad dealt a second successive fine for being three overs behind in the First Test. Ponting was subsequently stripped of thirty per cent of his A$12,750 match fee, twice the punishment of his team-mates in accordance with International Cricket Council rules for captains. Australia were largely untroubled by New Zealand, sweeping both Tests. Ponting scored only 100 runs at 33.33.\nAftermath.\nPonting was severely criticised for using the part-time bowlers ahead of his frontline men. Respected media analyst Peter Roebuck wrote in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" and \"The Age\", \"In one of the most baffling displays of captaincy seen in the long and proud history of Australian cricket, Ricky Ponting has denied his side a deserved chance of securing a famous victory. Rather than pressing home an advantage secured by dint of outstanding swing bowling and inspired spin in a fraught and fascinating afternoon session, the Australian captain preferred to use part-timers. Presumably, it was an attempt to improve an ailing over rate. Perhaps he was worried about missing the next match. Both issues pale into insignificance besides trying with every power at his disposal to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. There was a match to win. To an almost bizarre degree, Ponting lost the plot.\"\n\"Over 131 years, 404 men have been accorded to the honour of wearing the baggy green cap, arguably the most significant and recognizable symbol in Australian team sport,\" wrote Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Glenn Mitchell. \"Many today would have hung their head in sadness while others would have turned and in their grave. What happened today in Nagpur was at odds with team sport is all about. May it never be allowed to happen again.\" The barrage of Ponting's decision continued, with then Australian leading Test run-scorer (since overtaken by Ponting) saying on Fox Sports, \"I don't know what to make of this. They go into the tea break on a high and come out worrying about over-rates. I am glad Ricky can't read my mind right now because he is not going to like it.\" Ponting later admitted that Border's comment was the one that hurt him the most, despite News Limited reporter Jon Pierik describing his captaincy as a \"joke\", while Malcolm Conn from \"The Australian\" wrote it was his \"worst day as national captain\". Indian newspapers also continued with the criticism, with some suggesting Ponting put himself before the team. Ponting angrily responded to such comments at the post-Test media conference."

He also served as a minor league manager for a few years.\nPlaying career.\nReid began his playing career in 1921, at the age of 22. He won over 15 games in a season ten times, and he won over 20 games in a season three times - in 1923, with the Marshall Indians, with whom he went 20–8 in 235 innings of work; in 1936, when he went a combined 22–8 with a 2.83 ERA in 45 games split between the Jacksonville Jax and Fort Worth Cats; and in 1937, when he went 22-16 for the Fort Worth Cats. Overall, he posted a record of 294–227, and current records indicate that his career ERA was 2.70, however that is inaccurate as multiple seasons in which he pitched are missing ERA information. He played his final season in 1941.\nManaging career.\nHe managed the Marshall Indians for part of the 1923 season, replacing incumbent manager Hick Munsell and being replaced by Johnny Jones. He replaced Jimmy Sanders in 1935 as manager of the Jacksonville Jax, leading the league to become league champions that season. In 1938, he replaced Cecil Coombs as manager of the Fort Worth Cats, and in 1948 he replaced Babe Peebles as manager of the Gainesville Owls."

        "text": "Michael Maguire (born 5 February 1974) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach and former player who last coached New Zealand at international level. He played as a er and in the 1990s.\nAfter a playing career spent mostly at the Canberra Raiders, with a brief stint with the Adelaide Rams, he became assistant coach of Melbourne Storm under Craig Bellamy and in 2009 became a head coach in the Super League with English club the Wigan Warriors. He was previously the head coach for the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Wests Tigers in the National Rugby League (NRL)\nIn his first year as Wigan Warriors' coach Maguire won the 2010 Super League Grand Final. In his second year he won the 2011 Challenge Cup and was then signed by the Rabbitohs. In his first year as an NRL head coach he took South Sydney deep into the 2012 finals series. In 2013, Souths finished the regular season in second place and in 2014 they won their first premiership in 43 years.\nBackground.\nMaguire was born in Canberra, Australia Capital Territory, Australia.\nPlaying career.\nAfter initially starting playing in rugby union, Maquire signed for NSWRL club the Canberra Raiders in 1991 and made his Winfield Cup début for the club off the bench against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in a narrow 14–15 loss.\nMaguire did not feature again until 1994 when he came off the bench again against Penrith Panthers. He had a more consistent season the following year, making six appearances in total, most of which he started as either wing or centre. Maguire's first try came as a centre against the Parramatta Eels.\nIn 1997 Maguire left Canberra and signed for the new Adelaide Rams club in the breakaway Australian Super League competition. He made his début at fullback in the Rams inaugural game against the North Queensland Cowboys in Townsville which Adelaide lost 24–16. Maguire also participated in the World Club Challenge for the Rams that year. He went on to play four more games for Adelaide and scored one try before returning to Canberra in 1998. Maguire made two appearances for Canberra in 1998 before retiring after persistent neck problems.\nCoaching career.\nWhen Maguire retired from playing he initially left the game and taught physical education before signing as a strength and conditioning coach for Canberra. He later became an assistant coach for the Raiders' reserve grade under Mal Meninga. Maguire was eventually promoted to assistant coach of the Canberra first team alongside Matthew Elliott, before leaving the club in 2004 to take the assistant coaching job at Melbourne Storm under a former Raiders teammate, Craig Bellamy.\nMaguire was an integral part in Melbourne's stripped NRL premierships and took control of first team affairs when head coach Bellamy took up representative duties for the Blues in State of Origin. This earned him plaudits from senior coaches in the NRL and Maguire was linked with a move to Brisbane Broncos as head coach in 2008. He was heavily linked with a move to English club Wigan Warriors towards the end of the 2009 season and signed a three-year deal with the Super League side on 7 October 2009.\nWigan Warriors.\nMaguire started his Wigan coaching career with a victory against the Crusaders in his first home match of the season. He ended the Halliwell Jones hoodoo (Wigan hadn't won a competitive game away at Wire since they last played at Wilderspool) against Warrington in a thrilling match which Wigan won 22–20. He won RLW coach of the month for February. Maguire then recorded his biggest victory as a Wigan coach, beating nearest rivals St. Helens in the last ever Good Friday derby match at Knowsley Road. He and his assistant Shaun Wane helped guide Wigan to the League Leaders' Shield in 2010. This was the first time Wigan topped the table in 10 years and marked a trophy winning start to \"Madge's\" Wigan coaching tenure. Maguire guided Wigan to their first Super League Grand Final appearance in seven years as the Wigan club beat Leeds in a semi-final at Headingley by a scoreline of 26–6 on 25 September 2010. Maguire was crowned Coach of the Year 2010 at the annual Super League 'Man of Steel' awards dinner.\nMaguire managed the Wigan side to their first Super League Grand Final win in over 10 years beating their arch rivals in the 2010 Super League Grand Final victory over St. Helens at Old Trafford.\nThe following February his Wigan side took on 2010 NRL premiers St. George Illawarra Dragons in the 2011 World Club Challenge but were defeated. In 2011 Maguire announced his resignation from Wigan, in order to replace the retiring John Lang as head coach of National Rugby League club the South Sydney Rabbitohs for the 2012 NRL season.\nMaguire coached Wigan to the 2011 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs.\nMaguire joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in October 2011, after the end of the NRL and Super League seasons. He had signed a contract with the club earlier in the year, to replace the retiring John Lang. The Rabbitohs performed well during the 2012 NRL season with Maguire credited for the successful move of Greg Inglis from centre to full-back. The team progressed to within one game of the 2012 NRL Grand Final. The following year, Maguire guided Souths to within one game of the 2013 NRL Grand Final but the club were defeated 30–20 by Manly-Warringah in the preliminary final.\nIn the 2014 NRL season, Souths were tipped to be winners of the minor premiership, along with the Sydney Roosters and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. The first finals round saw Souths defeat Manly, then facing the Roosters in the preliminary final. Unlike the last round of the ordinary season, Souths overcome an early 12–0 deficit to score 32 unanswered points, eventually winning the match 32–22. Under Maguire's coaching this was the first time since 1971 that South Sydney had reached a grand final. Souths defeated the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30–6 in the 2014 NRL Grand Final, securing their 21st premiership and their first since 1971. In September 2017, Maguire was terminated as coach of South Sydney despite having two years remaining on his contract.\nWests Tigers.\nOn 28 October 2018, Maguire was announced as Head coach of Wests Tigers for the next three years. In his first year in charge of the Wests Tigers, Maguire guided the club to a ninth-place finish narrowly missing out on the finals.\nIn round 4 of the 2020 NRL season, Wests lost 28–23 to the struggling Gold Coast side giving them their first win in 364 days. In the post match press conference, Maguire spoke to the media saying I'm sick and tired of the ups and downs of the performances. We need to change that. That's what this club has been, I didn't want to say that, but it's the truth. and the truth is we need to fix how we do things when we are performing\".\nDuring the half-time interval in round 12 of the 2020 NRL season, Maguire was seen on a dressing room camera berating his players for their poor first half performance against the New Zealand Warriors. Maguire was then seen kicking a chair across the room.\nAt the end of his second year in charge of the Wests Tigers, the club finished a disappointing 11th on the table and missed out on the finals. Wests were also one of only five teams to concede over 500 points in the 2020 NRL season.\nIn the 2021 NRL season, Maguire guided the Wests Tigers to a disappointing 13th placed finish on the table including a 38-0 loss against Wooden Spoon side Canterbury in the last round. After the season had concluded, Maguire's position as head coach came under intense scrutiny but on 21 September 2021, the Wests Tigers board declared that Maguire would continue as head coach in 2022.\nOn 6 June 2022, Wests Tigers announced Maguire had been terminated as head coach with the club sitting 13th on the table. He was replaced by interim coach Brett Kimmorley.\nNew Zealand.\nIn 2018, Maguire became head coach of the New Zealand national rugby league team. Maguire took New Zealand to the semi-final of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup where they lost against Australia. On 4 November 2023, Maguire coached New Zealand to the Pacific Championships trophy upsetting Australia 30-0 in the final. New Zealand had won just one game against the Kangaroos in the previous nine outings, with a run of three-straight losses including an 18-point drubbing just a week earlier. In December 2023, Maguire signed a contract to become New South Wales head coach starting in 2024. It was reported that Maguire had been given an ultimatum by the New Zealand rugby league board to either stay solely with them or his contract would be terminated.\nHonours.\nWigan Warriors:\nGrand Final: 1\nLeague Leaders' Shield: 1\nChallenge Cup: 1\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs\nNational Rugby League Premierships: 1\nNRL Auckland Nines: 1\nWorld Club Challenge: 1\nNew Zealand\nPacific Cup 1"

        "text": "The Princeton University Rugby Football Club (or PURFC) is the college rugby team of Princeton University. The team currently competes in the Ivy Rugby Conference, an annual rugby union competition played among the eight member schools of the Ivy League.\nHistory.\nMen's team.\nPrinceton played Rutgers University in 1869 the first United States intercollegiate game, which, according to U.S. Soccer, used rules that resembled rugby union and association football and had little resemblance to gridiron American football as the teams were able to pick up and run with the ball but were not able to make a forward pass nor was there a line of scrimmage where a center snapped the ball but rather a scrum where players battled to gain possession.\nThe men's team agreed to only play using rugby union code rules on November 23, 1876 when Princeton Yale, Harvard, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts and formed the Intercollegiate Football Association. Among Princeton's first games using a rugby code closer to rugby union was a game (employing rules similar to rugby union but with twenty players) less than two weeks earlier against the University of Pennsylvania rugby football team in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876. This game against Penn and other games Princeton played in 1876 make Princeton one of the oldest rugby clubs in North America. Princeton played in the very first Thanksgiving rugby football game against Yale on November 30, 1876. \n From 1877 until at least 1903, Princeton played football using rugby rules.\nIndeed by 1893, forty thousand (40,000) spectators showed up to watch Princeton play Yale on Thanksgiving in New York’s Manhattan Field. The game they played on Thanksgiving of 1893 was much closer to rugby than American football as there were no forward passes (as such rule was not established for another dozen or so years when Walter Camp, a Yale Alumnus and rugby player, worked with University of Pennsylvania alumnus and rugby player John Heisman to change the rules of 19th century college rugby to create American Football). \nPrinceton continued to have its alumni play rugby in first decade of 20th century as demonstrated by the experience of Donald Grant “Heff” Herring Sr., Princeton class of 1907, who as a senior, won Princeton’s first Rhodes scholarship for graduate study at Merton College, Oxford University where he became the first American to play on the Oxford University rugby team that beat arch-rival Cambridge University by the then-record score of 35 to 3.\nA letter to the \"Varsity\", a sports paper in Oxford, reviewed Herring’s stellar career at Princeton and Oxford, reported that he was caricatured in a cartoon in \"The Tatler\", an English sporting magazine, and detailed that he created a sensation in America by stating in a 1910 letter to The Daily Princetonian that British rugby football was a better game than the American Football game. In 1910 \"Heff\" Herring was hired by Woodrow Wilson just months before Wilson was elected Governor of New Jersey, but is better known for his military service in both world wars and acquiring one of the finest arts and crafts homes near campus, the Donald Grant Herring Estate\nPrinceton rugby was reorganized in 1931 under the leadership of Monte Barak, Hugh Sloan H.F. Langenberg, and coach John Boardman Whitton. It has been playing continuously ever since. Over 5,000 people attended the inaugural Harvard - Princeton game in 1931.\nThe club competes in the Ivy Rugby Conference. Princeton won the Ivy League Rugby Tournament (the tournament that crowned the Ivy Champion prior to the formation of Ivy Rugby Conference) in 2004, 1979, 1973, 1971, and 1969. The team also qualified for the Division I-AA Sweet 16 in 2014. The men's current coach is Richard Beck.\nWomen's team.\nPrinceton University Women's Rugby Football Club (PUWRFC), is the women's rugby union club of Princeton. PUWRFC was established in 1979 by Catherine Chute. The new team aspired to compete in the young world of U.S. women's rugby, which was established only eight years earlier by the creation of four women's teams in 1972. Since then, the sport has grown quickly across America and PUWRFC has continually found itself at the top levels of Division I competition. Currently, the Princeton women compete in Division I of the Ivy League. PUWRFC is coached by Josie Ziluca.\nPUWRFC won back-to-back national championships in 1995 and 1996. Princeton women advanced to the Final Four in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2005. Throughout the team's history, PUWRFC has often won the MARFU Championship, the Ivy League Tournament, and has secured several bids to the Sweet Sixteen. More than 35 Princeton women have been named All-Americans, many of whom have received honors for multiple years. In 2011 and 2012, the women placed 3rd in the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships.\nIn the first year of regular season Ivy League play, the Princeton women won the 2013 Ivy League Championships.\nThe Women have also seen success with their rugby sevens squad, winning the shield final at the USA Rugby College 7s National Championship.\nPUWRFC will become Princeton's 19th women's varsity program starting in the 2022–23 academic year.\nFacilities.\nRickerson Field at West Windsor Fields.\nPrinceton Rugby has its club house, three game fields, two practice fields and a scrummage machine located at West Windsor Fields. The pitches are across Lake Carnegie and are accessible from campus by the Washington Road bridge. \nPrinceton University’s West Windsor fields were the site of a week-long USA Rugby Collegiate All-Star selection camp in 2009.\nPrinceton plays its home games on Rickerson Field located at West Windsor Fields. The field is named after Stu Rickerson, Class of 1971, and his Princeton varsity soccer playing spouse, Nancy Jones Rickerson, Class of 1987.\nHaaga House.\nOpened in 2013, Princeton Rugby has a home in Haaga House located at West Windsor Fields. Haaga House was named after alumnus Paul G. Haaga Jr. following a donation to build the clubhouse. It includes Men's and Women's team rooms, visiting team changing rooms, bathroom facilities, storage rooms, and a large gathering space for events and spectators. Princeton is one of the few universities in America to have a dedicated rugby facility.\nThe Dickey-Larrimer Rugby Porch.\nThe porch at the Princeton eating club Tiger Inn has been named \"The Dickey-Larrimer Rugby Porch\" in honor of Will Dickey, 68' and Terry Larrimer, 69', two former Princeton Rugby Captains. The porch also has a permanent installation called the \"Rugby Wall\" that lists all previous men's and women's Rugby Captains on bronze plaques. The rugby club holds gatherings on the porch, such as post-game socials and alumni events, and utilizes the Inn's boardroom for executive meetings.\nCups and competitions.\nIvy League regular season.\nThe first Ivy League Rugby Championship was played in 1969 and won by Princeton. In 2009, the men joined a newly established Ivy Rugby Conference that was formed to foster better competition among rugby teams from the Ivy League schools and to raise the quality of play. Ivy Rugby formed committees to manage the league independently of the Territorial Area Unions. The Ivy Rugby Conference, and specifically its sevens tournament, has enabled the Ivy schools to tap into existing rivalries and fan bases. The women began a full season of Ivy League play in the fall of 2011.\nIvy Rugby 7s Championship.\nIn addition to their traditional 15-a-side rugby union teams, the men and women each field a rugby sevens squad. Every year Princeton and the other Ivy Conference teams compete for the Ivy Rugby 7s Championship. The winner of the Ivy Championship qualifies for the College 7s National Championship.\nThe Koranda Cup.\nThe Yale vs. Princeton rugby rivalry has strong historic roots dating back to the 1870s. The first game between the schools in the modern era occurred in 1931, which resulted in a Princeton win. In 2002, after many years of not playing Yale regularly, Princeton decided to re-establish the tradition and challenge Yale to an annual match each spring. The following year, Yale accepted Princeton's request by creating a trophy in memory of Rob Koranda. Rob died in a Chicago porch collapse in June 2003, a tragedy that claimed 12 other young lives.\nNew Jersey State Championship.\nThe New Jersey State Intercollegiate Championship is hosted at West Windsor Fields every spring. The sport of rugby has been played in New Jersey for more than 135 years, yet it has only been since 2007 that the colleges of The Garden State have competed for the intercollegiate state championship. It is a knock-out tournament for the 1st and 2nd XV Men's rugby sides from every college in New Jersey. The tournament includes the selection of an All-New Jersey XV and MVP. Participants have included Drew, Fairleigh Dickinson, Montclair, NJIT, Princeton, Rowan, Rutgers, Seton Hall, TCNJ, and William Patterson.\nSince the 2010 tournament, the players have helped raise awareness and call for more research funding for pancreatic cancer organizations. This intercollegiate rugby initiative has raised over $140,000 for The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.\nThe winner of The New Jersey State Intercollegiate Championship is awarded \"The Rickerson Cup.\" The trophy is named for Princeton alumnus and New Jersey native Stuart Rickerson, for his 40 plus years of support for the sport of rugby in New Jersey.\nOther competitions.\nThe Doc Whitton Cup is contested annually between current undergraduate players and returning alumni during reunions. The first match was played in 1970 and has been played every year since.\nPrinceton competed in and won a number of times the now defunct Bermuda Intercollegiate Cup. The competition was held during Bermuda Rugby Week from the 1930s to the 1950s. The Cup was offered by the Bermuda Trade Development Board but was dropped in 1958 because of complaints about off-pitch behavior.\nAwards.\nRob Koranda MVP Award: &lt;br&gt; \nPrinceton Men's Rugby Most Valuable Player Award, granted annually.\nPhil Rogers' 79 Memorial Prize: &lt;br&gt; \nA winner will be recognized annually for his or her unique leadership and sportsmanship qualities, both on and off the rugby field. These qualities are well captured in Rudyard Kipling’s poem “IF”. They include courage, tenacity, composure, action and fairness. It is against these criteria that each candidate is measured.\nChris Mello Award: &lt;br&gt; \nGiven annually to the Men's player who best demonstrates loyalty to the team on and off the field.\nHarry Langenberg Award: &lt;br&gt; \nAwarded for outstanding dedication and service to the Princeton Rugby Football Club.\nInternational tours.\nPrinceton Rugby goes on tour each spring. Past tours have included travel to Bermuda, England, Martinique, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Ireland, Barbados, and the Cayman Islands. These tours have often resulted in wins over the local National XV.\nPrinceton Rugby, along with the Harvard and Yale Rugby teams, began the tradition of U.S. college students going on Spring Break to the Caribbean.\nIn 1940, the team traveled over spring break to Nassau and played before the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\nAlumni Tours, where former players travel abroad to compete and reconnect with their teammates, have been popular events since Princeton Rugby's early days.

        "title": "Neil Robinson (baseball)",
        "text": "Cornelius Randall Robinson (July 31, 1907 – July 23, 1983), known professionally as Neil Robinson, was a major league baseball player in the segregated Negro leagues. Also known by the nicknames Neal and Shadow, he primarily played as a center fielder in the 1930s and 1940s, but as a semipro player he alternated between the outfield, shortstop, and third baseman. For the majority of his twenty-three year career, Robinson played for the Memphis Red Sox. Prior to being acquired by Memphis, he played one season for the Homestead Grays and three seasons with the Cincinnati Tigers.\nThroughout his career, he was known as a power hitter and ranks as the greatest hitter in the history of Memphis Red Sox franchise. Robinson won back-to-back Negro American League home run titles in 1939 and 1940 and appeared in nine Negro League East-West All Star Games. In the history of the East-West All Star Game, Robinson ranks as one of the Midsummer Classic's greatest hitters rivaling Mule Suttles, Josh Gibson, and Ted Strong. \nRobinson also played several exhibition games against white Major League Baseball players throughout his career. Although his number of plate appearances were limited, Robinson's ability to put the baseball in play against his white counterparts exceeded his career statistics against that of Negro league opponents. In 2006, he was selected as one of ninety-six candidates to be considered for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame by The Committee on African American Baseball. Despite not being selected, elite hitting and longevity made Robinson one of the great Negro league players with an extended career in the Deep South.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was born in Birmingham, Alabama on July 31, 1907, to Cornell Robinson and Flora Fitzpatrick. The middle child of three, Robinson grew up in the small community of Opelika. His father Cornell worked as a porter in Alabama and nearby Columbus, Georgia. In Opelika, Robinson learned to play baseball at a very young age. When asked by a reporter about his fielding abilities during a semipro game, Robinson remarked that he had, “been practicing how to throw a ball since I was old enough to carry a bat.” In 1919, Cornell Robinson passed away. Shortly after his death, Robinson's mother moved the family north to Gary, Indiana. The Robinson children all found work in the booming industrial town. Neil and his brother John worked as laborers while their younger sister, Florida, found worked as a maid. During their time in Gary, Neil and John were introduced to Gary's industrial baseball teams and their, mostly Chicago based, opponents. By 1928, both brothers were playing on semipro barnstorming teams.\nBaseball.\nSemi-Pro.\nRobinson and his brother played for the Illinois Giants in the spring of 1928. The Giants, based out of the Chicago area, were a barnstorming team that traveled through Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. By June of that year, the brothers were playing for the Fox Jewelry Colored Giants based out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Robinson would play for the Fox Giants through 1929. In 1930 the brothers moved south and both signed with the Lexington Hard Hitters. Robinson would also play several games for the Lockland Valley Tigers that year, but for the majority of the season he was a member of the Hard Hitters. In 1931 Neil played for both the Gary, Indiana Steel City Giants and the Gray Grasselli Giants. He returned to Grand Rapids playing for the Fineis Oils Giants in 1932 and the Pere Marquette Giants in 1933.\nDuring his time in Grand Rapids and Lexington, Robinson was known for both his hitting and fielding. Robinson was selected as part of a Grand Rapids All-Star team on three occasions to play major league teams. He took part in exhibition games against the Philadelphia Athletics, Detroit Tigers, and St. Louis Cardinals. In twelve at bats, he had five hits.\nHomestead Grays.\nIn 1934, Robinson was hired by Cumberland Posey to play for the Homestead Grays. He replaced outfielder Vic Harris who was now a member of the Pittsburgh Crawfords. Robinson's batting average at the end of the 1934 season was .241. 1934 was his only season with the Grays. A drinking problem that would plague Robinson throughout his career led to his dismissal from the team.\nCincinnati Tigers.\nRobinson played with the Cincinnati Tigers from 1935 to 1937. In 1935 and 1936, the Tigers were a member of the Indiana-Ohio League and associate with both the Negro National League and the Negro Southern League. In 1937, the Tigers joined the newly formed Negro American League. Robinson would develop into a power hitter while playing in Cincinnati. In 1936 he batted .419 and in 1937 his average was .301. In 1936, Robinson reportedly hit the longest home run in the Sherwood Oval. The ball “hit the 472-foot sign on about three bounces.” He finished the 1936 season with 34 home runs against all levels of competition.\nMemphis Red Sox.\nAt the end of the 1937 season, despite their success on the field, the Cincinnati Tigers disbanded. The Memphis Red Sox, also founding members of the Negro American League, acquired Robinson and several other players from the Tigers as the 1938 season started. Robinson remained with the Red Sox for fifteen years until his retirement in 1952. During that time he was the team's top player and biggest attraction. From 1938 to 1948 he was Memphis’ leading hitter with 167 RBIs and a batting average of .299. Over the 38-year history of the Memphis Red Sox, Robinson was the greatest hitter the team would ever have on its roster.\nThe new talent that Memphis acquired from the former Tigers, including Robinson, had an immediate effect on the team. The Red Sox were in first place at the end of the first half of the 1938 season which earned them a spot in league championship series against the Atlanta Black Crackers. In the abbreviated two-game series Robinson led the Red Sox offense by going four for four with a walk, two home runs, five RBIs.\nRobinson played in his first East-West All Star game in 1938. His inside the park home run scored three runs and led the West to a 5–4 victory over the East.\nIn 1939 Robinson continued to hit the baseball out of park for the Red Sox. This led the Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper to dub him the “negro home run artist.” Neil hit twenty-five home runs against league teams in both barnstorming games and official league games. He hit fifty-four home runs against all levels of competition. While Robinson's batting average dropped to .275, another home run at the East-West All Star game helped lead the West to victory.\nBetween 1940 and 1948, Robinson batted greater than .300 over a season four more times. In 1943, Robinson's boyhood home of Gray, Indiana held a “Neil Robinson Day.” The game was between the East Chicago Giants and the Chicago Brown Bombers at E. J. Block Stadium in East Chicago. Robinson played center field for the East Chicago Giants who won 6–1. The following year “Neil Robinson Day” was celebrated at Wrigley Field. The Memphis Red Sox played a double header against the Kansas City Monarchs. Robinson marked the occasion by hitting a home run off of the Monarchs pitcher Satchel Paige. The Red Sox won both games. Earlier that year, on the south side of Chicago, Robinson hit a grand slam at Comiskey Stadium against the Chicago American Giants.\nAt the end of the 1948 Negro American League season, Robinson played with the Kansas City Royals. The Royals were a collection of the Negro League All-Stars including Satchel Paige, who was now a member of the Cleveland Indians. The Royals played a team of Major League All-Stars headed by Cleveland Indians pitcher Bob Lemon. The Kansas City Royals won three of the six games they played against Lemon's All-Stars. Robinson had three hits in nine at bats and a total of four RBIs.\nIn 1951, the last full year that Robinson played baseball, Howe News Bureau listed his batting average as .416 in the early part of June. Robinson was again voted to attend the East-West All-Star game, but due to injuries he was unable to play. Robinson finished the year batting hitting .344. During the postseason, he played as part of a Negro League All-Star team against Roy Campanella's Major League All-Stars.\nBasketball.\nRobinson played semipro basketball in both the winter of 1930 and 1931 for Gilkerson's Union Giants. He played as one of the teams Forwards and was called “Shadow” by his teammates, a nickname that was given to him due to his quickness on the court. The team also included olympian Sol Butler and Harlem Globetrotter founder Tommy Brookins.\nLater life and death.\nRobinson lived in Cincinnati until his death on July 23, 1983.\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball stats and Seamheads"

He was named the consensus All-American at quarterback in 1912.\nBiography.\nA native of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Crowther enrolled at Brown University where he played three years of varsity football. He was Brown's starting quarterback from 1910 to 1912. He scored 77 points on 14 touchdowns and a field goal during his career at Brown. Crowther was considered \"a slippery runner with good speed.\" Crowther did not wear a helmet and instead played with a white elastic band around his head.\nVarious accounts indicate that he weighed between 130 and 135 pounds while playing football at Brown. He received the nickname \"Kid\" because of his small size. In a game against Harvard in 1912, the Harvard coach suggested that the diminutive Crowther should be removed for the game \"for his own safety,\" and Crowther responded with a 48-yard run for a touchdown in the game. Crowther's run was Brown's only touchdown against Harvard; one newspaper described the play as follows: \"The last period was played in twilight and it was then that Crowther, the Brown quarter back, ran half the length of the field for Brown's only touchdown.\"\nCrowther also handled kickoff and punt returns for Brown, and in 1911 he tied the Brown record for the longest kickoff return with a 110-yard return against UMass. Crowther also had other long runs, including a 65-yard kickoff return against Bowdoin. He also led Brown to a 30–7 win over Penn, Crowther reportedly \"returned punts like a demon, and crisply directed four touchdown drives that had the fans at old Andrews Field delirious with joy.\" At the end of the 1912 season, Crowthers was selected as a first-team All-American at the quarterback position by Walter Camp (for Collier's Weekly) and W.J. MacBeth.\nCrowther also played baseball at Brown and later in semi-professional leagues around New England.\nCrowther graduated from Brown in 1913. He later recalled playing against Jim Thorpe in a Thanksgiving Day game against the Carlisle Indian School. He described Thorpe as the \"best I ever played against.\"\nCrowther lived in Fitchburg, Massachusetts in his later years. His wife, Elizabeth Crowther, died in September 1962. Crowther died less than a year later in July 1963.\nCrowther was posthumously inducted into the Brown University Hall of Fame in 1972."

        "title": "List of boxing septuple champions",
        "text": "A septuple champion in boxing refers to a boxer who has won world titles in seven different categories of weight.\nRecognition.\nMajor sanctioning bodies.\nThere is some dispute on which sanctioning body is considered \"major\" enough to award championships. The \"Big 4\" sanctioning bodies are always included. They are arranged in order of foundation:\n\"The Ring\".\nThe Ring, boxing's most respected magazine, has awarded world championships in professional boxing within each weight class from its foundation in 1922 until the 1990s, and again since 2001. \"The Ring\" champions were at one point held the linear reign to the throne, the man who beat the man. The lineal champion is also known as the true champion of the division. \"The Ring\" stopped giving belts to world champions in the 1990s but began again in 2002. \nIn 2002, \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy. It echoed many critics' arguments that the sanctioning bodies in charge of boxing championships had undermined the sport by pitting undeserving contenders against undeserving \"champions\", and forcing the boxing public to see mismatches for so-called \"world championships\". \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy that is \"intended to reward fighters who, by satisfying rigid criteria, can justify a claim as the true and only world champion in a given weight class.\" \"The Ring\" claims to be more authoritative and open than the sanctioning bodies' rankings, with a page devoted to full explanations for ranking changes. A fighter pays no sanctioning fees to defend or fight for the title at stake, contrary to practices of the sanctioning bodies. Furthermore, a fighter cannot be stripped of the title unless he loses, decides to move to a different weight division, or retires.\nThere are currently only two ways that a boxer can win \"The Ring\"'s title: defeat the reigning champion; or win a box-off between the magazine's number-one and number-two rated contenders (or, sometimes, number-one and number-three rated). A vacant \"Ring\" championship is filled when the number-one contender in a weight-division battles the number-two contender or the number-three contender (in cases where \"The Ring\" determines that the number-two and number-three contenders are close in abilities and records).\nIn May 2012, citing the number of vacancies in various weight classes as primary motivation, \"The Ring\" unveiled a new championship policy. Under the new policy, \"The Ring\" title can be awarded when the No. 1 and No. 2 fighters face one another or when the Nos. 1 and 2 contenders choose not to fight one another and either of them fights No. 3, No. 4 or No. 5, the winner may be awarded \"The Ring\" belt. In addition, there are now six ways for a fighter to lose his title: lose a fight in his championship weight class; move to another weight class; not schedule a fight in any weight class for 18 months; not schedule a fight in his championship weight class for 18 months, even if fighting at another weight class; not scheduling a fight with a top 5 contender in any weight class for two years; or retiring.\nMany media outlets and members are extremely critical of the new championship policy and state that if this new policy is followed \"The Ring\" title will lose the credibility it once held.\nLineal.\nThe Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) hands out the official version of the lineal championship. TBRB awards vacant championships when the two top-ranked fighters in any division meet and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true champions\" each weight classes. The Board was formed to continue where \"The Ring\" \"left off\" in the aftermath of its purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007 and the following dismissal of Nigel Collins. After the new editors announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three prominent members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. This three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England.\nSince 2012, lineal champions are predetermined by the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which promotes the concept of a singular world champion per weight class. Lineal champions are listed on \"Cyber Boxing Zone\" website which list lineal champions of the \"Queensberry Era\" to date.\nMinor sanctioning bodies.\nThe International Boxing Organization (IBO) is sometimes included in the list of major boxing organizations. \nBesides the IBO, there are other sanctioning bodies. They are: International Boxing Association (IBA), International Boxing Council (IBC), International Boxing Board (IBB), International Boxing League (IBL), International Boxing Union (IBU), Global Boxing Association (GBA), Global Boxing Council (GBC), Global Boxing Federation GBF, Global Boxing Organization (GBO), Global Boxing Union (GBU), National Boxing Association (NBA), Transcontinental World Boxing Association (TWBA), Universal Boxing Association (UBA), Universal Boxing Council (UBC), Universal Boxing Federation (UBF), Universal Boxing Organization (UBO), UNIBOX, United States Boxing Council (USBC), World Athletic Association (WAA), World Boxing Forum (WBF), World Boxing Board (WBB), World Boxing Championship Committee (WBCC), World Boxing Empire (WBE), World Boxing Foundation (WBFo), World Boxing Institute (WBI), World Boxing League (WBL), World Boxing Network (WBN), World Boxing Union (WBU), World Cup of Boxing (WCOB), World Junior Boxing Federation (WJBF), World Tournament Boxing Federation (WTBF) and the World United Boxing Association (WUBA).\nNote:\nList of men's septuple champions.\nThe following is a list of septuple champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and \"The Ring.\"\nList of women's septuple champion.\nThe following is a list of women’s septuple champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and The Ring.\nSeptuple champions that won titles in other multiple divisions.\nSome fighters of this group or club were not satisfied to win just the incredible milestone of championships in seven different weight divisions but to reach immortality in eight other different divisions or categories. At present, only one boxer in history has ever achieved to become Octuple Champion or a boxer who has won different titles in eight different categories of weight. Manny Pacquiao won his November 13, 2010 bout against Antonio Margarito for the vacant WBC World Super Welterweight Title, and became the first ever Octuple Champion in history of boxing."

Their head coach was Jamie Dixon, who was in his 7th year as head coach at Pittsburgh and 11th overall at the University. The team played its home games in the Petersen Events Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and were members of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 25–9, 13–5 in Big East play and lost in the quarterfinals of the 2010 Big East men's basketball tournament.

The team lost four starters, including NBA draft selections Sam Young and DeJuan Blair, along with point guard Levance Fields and forward/center Tyrell Biggs. Guard Jermaine Dixon was the only returning starter from last season's squad while projected starter Gilbert Brown was suspended for the fall semester for academic reasons, although he reenrolled and returned to the team in December. Four freshman joined the Panthers, including McDonald's High School All-American Dante Taylor. Also new to the team was senior guard Chase Adams, a transfer from Centenary College of Louisiana. The Panthers' roster was the most inexperienced in the Big East, with six freshmen, two sophomores and only two seniors, and when Dixon went down with a foot injury in the offseason, ruling him out until well into December, the remaining roster had a total of one career start.\nThe Panthers were selected to finish 9th in the Big East by the Big East coaches during their conference media day.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#091C44; color:#CEC499;\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#091C44; color:#CEC499;\" | Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#091C44; color:#CEC499;\" | Big East tournament \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#091C44; color:#CEC499;\" | NCAA tournament"

        "text": "James Wright (born March 24, 1990) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He won a Memorial Cup with the Vancouver Giants in 2007 and was selected by Tampa Bay 117th overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nWright began his major junior career with the Vancouver Giants in 2005–06, debuting in two WHL games. The following season, he recorded 12 points in 48 games during his WHL rookie season. He helped the Giants finish as league runner-up in the playoffs to the Medicine Hat Tigers before winning the 2007 Memorial Cup championship against the same Tigers squad in the CHL title final. In 2007–08, Wright improved to 36 points and was drafted 117th overall by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Upon being drafted, Wright continued to play for the Giants, scoring 21 goals and 47 points in 2008–09.\nProfessional.\nWright made the Lightning roster for the start of the 2009–10 season, making his NHL debut on October 3, 2009, in a 6–3 loss to the Atlanta Thrashers. He played the game opposite former Giants linemate Evander Kane of the Thrashers, who was also playing his first NHL game. Wright scored his first NHL goal in his seventh game on October 22, 2009, against Evgeni Nabokov of the San Jose Sharks.\nAfter scoring two goals and three assists through 48 games, he was sent back to the Giants on January 21, 2010. Returning to the WHL, he notched six goals and 19 points through the final 21 games of the 2009–10 WHL season. In the playoffs, the Giants advanced to the semifinals, where they were eliminated in six games by the Tri-City Americans. Wright recorded seven goals and 16 points in 16 post-season games.\nWright began the 2010-11 season in the AHL. He played 15 games for the Lightning's top affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals, before making his 2010–11 NHL season debut for Tampa Bay in an away game against the Philadelphia Flyers on November 18, 2010. On December 2, 2011, Wright was traded by the Lightning, along with Mike Vernace, to the Florida Panthers for Mike Kostka and Evan Oberg. He was then immediately assigned to AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage. On January 18, 2013, the eve of the 2012–13 season, Wright was claimed off waivers from the Panthers by the Winnipeg Jets.\nAfter two seasons with the Jets, Wright was released as a free agent, and with limited interest around the league, signed his first contract abroad with Croatian club KHL Medveščak Zagreb of the Kontinental Hockey League, on September 15, 2014.\nOn July 2, 2015, Wright returned to North America, signing a one-year, two-way contract with the New York Islanders. He was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers for the duration of the 2015–16 season.\nIn the following off-season, having been unable to add to his NHL resume, Wright returned to the KHL, signing a one-year deal with Russian club, Admiral Vladivostok on September 8, 2016. Agreeing to return for a second season in Vladivostok in 2017–18, Wright was traded by the club to Kazakhstani outfit, Barys Astana in exchange for Martin St. Pierre on November 24, 2017.\nAs a free agent following the season with Barys Astana, Wright left the KHL and ventured to Sweden in agreeing to an optional two-year contract with Linköpings HC of the SHL on July 23, 2018. The optional second year on his contract with the Swedish club was cancelled at the end of the 2018–19 season.\nPersonal life.\nWright is the grandson of former Saskatoon mayor Cliff Wright. The elder Wright served as the city's mayor from 1976 to 1988 and was instrumental in the construction of Saskatchewan Place, which opened at the end of his term in 1988."

        "title": "Day/night cricket",
        "text": "Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally or partially under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC), attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.\nFloodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield. Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches, as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nIn October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches. The first day/night Test Match took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC-sanctioned day/night match.\nHistory.\nAlthough the idea was birthed in the western Adelaide suburb of Cowandilla in the 1930s, which led to an 11 team Electric Light Cricket competition there in the 1930s, it is believed that the first match played under floodlights in England was on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to \"Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down, but they can't promise.\" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. \"The Times\" was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: \"What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?\"\nIt appeared that the cricketing world concurred with \"The Times\" that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore. After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called \"Supertests\" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the \"Supertests\" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end. The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.\nFloodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate made the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.\nDay/night first-class matches.\nDuring the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises. The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception. A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.\nThe 2013–14 Sheffield Shield season included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls. The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand. This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.\nIndia's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan. Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball. In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season. Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.\nThe second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016. In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.\nAustralia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.\nOn 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval."

        "text": "The Women's sprint cross-country skiing competition in the classical technique at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada was held on 17 February at Whistler Olympic Park in Whistler, British Columbia.\nCanada's Chandra Crawford was the defending Olympic champion in this event, though that event was in the freestyle technique. Italy's Arianna Follis was the defending world champion in this event which was also held in freestyle technique. Alena Procházková of Slovakia won the test event that took place at Olympic venue on 16 January 2009. The last World Cup event prior to the 2010 Games in this format took place on 6 February 2010 in Canmore, Alberta and was won by Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk.\nFollis did not qualify for the event at the Winter Olympics. Crawford and Procházková were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Kowalczyk won silver. It was Bjørgen's second medal at these Olympics and first gold for her. Majdič won her first Olympic medal and the first for Slovenia in cross-country skiing. During the warm-up she crashed down a bank, into an unprotected deep gorge and landed on ice and rocks, sustaining five broken ribs and a pneumothorax. In spite of agonizing pain, she finished third in the sprint a few hours later, winning the first individual Winter Olympic medal for Slovenia in 16 years and its first ever in cross-country skiing at the Winter Olympics. She earned the highest praise from other skiers, staff and the media for her amazing bravery as she attended the medal giving ceremony with a tube in her chest to relieve pneumothorax.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nQualifying took place at 10:15 PST.\nQuarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals took place at 12:30 PST.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinals took place at 13:20 PST.\nFinal.\nFinal took place at 13:45 PST."

        "text": "The women's 4 x 5 kilometre relay cross-country skiing competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada was held on 25 February at Whistler Olympic Park at 11:15 PST.\nRussia was the defending Olympic champion with the team of Natalia Baranova-Masolkina, Larisa Kurkina, Yuliya Chepalova, and Yevgeniya Medvedeva-Arbuzova. Baranova-Masolikina retired following the 2006 Winter Olympics while Chepalova retired in August 2009 after testing positive for recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) doping. (She would be banned from the International Ski Federation (FIS) for two years in a decision rendered on 23 December 2009 that would run until 20 August 2011.) The defending world champions were the Finnish team of Pirjo Muranen, Virpi Kuitunen, Riitta-Liisa Roponen, and Aino-Kaisa Saarinen (The same foursome also won the event at the 2007 championships.) The last World Cup competition for this event prior to the 2010 Games took place 22 November 2009 in Beitostoelen, Norway and was won by the Swedish team of Anna Olsson, Sara Lindborg, Anna Haag, and Charlotte Kalla.\nEach team used four skiers who each compete over two separate 2.5 km circuits with classical using the red circuit while freestyle using the blue circuit. The first two raced in the classical technique, and the final pair of skiers raced freestyle technique.\nResults.\nThe following are the results of the event.\nSweden's Olsson had the fastest first leg with Norway and Germany, who were using the same foursome in the starting order shown that won them silver at last year's world championships, rounding out the top three. Kowalczyk had the fastest second leg and in the classical technique, moved Poland (who would finish sixth) into the lead after the second exchange with Italy (who would finish fourth) and Norway rounding out the top three. Kalla of Sweden would have the fastest third leg and in the freestyle technique to propel her country from eighth to fifth. The top three after the third exchange was Norway, Italy, and tied for third with Germany and defending world champion Finland, who was using the same foursome in their same starting order. Norway's Bjørgen had the final anchor leg to give her team their first Olympic gold medal in this event since the 1984 Winter Olympics. Defending Olympic champion Russia, with Medvedeva (formerly Medvedeva-Abruzova) being the only returning member, finished a disappointing eighth. Meanwhile, the Swedes, winners of the last World Cup event, finished fifth with Kalla being the only returnee of the foursome that won the previous November."

        "text": "The women's 30 kilometre classical cross-country skiing competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada was held on 27 February at Whistler Olympic Park in Whistler, British Columbia at 11:45 PST.\nSummary.\nThe 30 kilometre has been skated as a mass start event at the World Championships since 2005 and since the 2006 Winter Olympics. Kateřina Neumannová of the Czech Republic was the defending Olympic champion though that event was held in the freestyle technique. She retired after the 2006-07 season and later chaired the organizing committee for the 2009 world championships. Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk, the defending Olympic bronze medallist, was the reigning world champion though that was also in the freestyle technique. The last World Cup event in the 30 km classical took place in Trondheim, Norway on 14 March 2009 and was won by Petra Majdič of Slovenia.\nThe race was a mass start event where all of the skiers start at the same time.\nResults.\nMajdič, the bronze medallist in the sprint event at these games who also won the last event in this format prior to this race, did not participate in the wake of crashing down a bank, into an unprotected deep gorge and landing on ice and rocks, resulting in five broken ribs and a pneumothorax prior to the start of qualifying for the sprint event ten days earlier. This race also matched up the last four world champions in this event (Zavyalova: 2003, Bjørgen: 2005, Kuitunen: 2007, and Kowalczyk: 2009.).\nAt the 7.1 km mark, the top three leaders were Størmer Steira (who finished eighth), Jatskaja (who finished 19th), and Kalla (who finished sixth). Kowalczyk, the defending world champion, led at the halfway mark, followed by Saarinen and Longa (who finished 12th). Bjørgen, the 2005 world champion in this event, held the lead at the 22.1 km mark, followed by Kowalczyk and Saarinen, who changed skis at the 25 km mark. Kowalczyk's finish over Bjørgen was the closest in Olympic history, edging out Neumannová's 1.4-second win over Russia's Yuliya Chepalova at the previous Olympics in Turin.\nKowalczyk is the first woman from Poland to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics and only the second overall, after Wojciech Fortuna's victory in the ski jumping individual large hill event at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. Saarinen earned her first and only individual Winter Olympic medal. 2003 World champion Zavylova finished 23rd while 2007 World champion Kuitunen finished 14th."

        "text": "The 2010 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Gran Premio Santander d'Italia 2010) was the fourteenth round of the 2010 Formula One season. It was held in Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Monza, Italy on 12 September 2010. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso won the race from pole position, taking Ferrari's first win on home soil since 2006 and their last until 2019.\nReport.\nBackground.\nOn the Wednesday before the race, Ferrari were summoned before the FIA World Motor Sport Council to answer charges related to fixing a race outcome through the use of team orders – banned since 2003 under Article 39.1 of the sporting regulations following an infamous incident at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix – and subsequently bringing the sport into disrepute at the German Grand Prix. Although Ferrari were fined US$100,000 at the time of the incident, the special meeting of the WMSC opened the door for further sanctions. The tribunal eventually decided against punishing the team further, with a promise to review the ban on team orders, a decision that was received negatively by fans.\nFollowing increased speculation over Red Bull and Ferrari appearing to use flexible bodywork – banned under the sporting regulations – the FIA announced its intention to intensify testing procedures for the second time, having increased lateral load-bearing tests on the front wings at Spa-Francorchamps. Speculation within the Belgian paddock suggested that both teams had been using flexible floors to lower the front wings closer to the roadway, giving rise to the FIA's plan for stricter testing at Monza. On the Wednesday before the race, McLaren admitted to changing the floor of the MP4-25 to meet the increased load tests.\nLewis Hamilton led the drivers' championship and Mark Webber went into this race 3 points behind, since Sebastian Vettel, Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso did not score in Belgium. They were over a race win behind Hamilton and Webber. Sakon Yamamoto took Karun Chandhok's seat again for the Italian Grand Prix.\nQualifying.\nThe first qualifying session saw all six cars from the new teams knocked out, with Jarno Trulli in the Lotus leading among them in 18th. His teammate Heikki Kovalainen was 19th and then came Vitantonio Liuzzi, whose Force India had had technical issues. Timo Glock had originally been ahead of Liuzzi in his Virgin, but he was handed a five place grid penalty for changing his gearbox, putting him at the very back. Lucas di Grassi was 21st in the other Virgin ahead of Bruno Senna and Sakon Yamamoto in the HRTs.\nThere were no real surprises in the second qualifying session either, as the two BMW Saubers of Kamui Kobayashi (13th) and Pedro de la Rosa (17th) were eliminated along with the Toro Rossos of Sébastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari, the Force India of Adrian Sutil and Michael Schumacher's Mercedes. Also eliminated was Vitaly Petrov, who qualified his Renault 15th but was given a five place grid drop for blocking Glock in the first session.\nRubens Barrichello scraped into the top 10 and qualified tenth in his Williams, just behind Robert Kubica in the other Renault. It was a good performance from the other Williams of Nico Hülkenberg, who out qualified his teammate to qualify eighth. Nico Rosberg was probably pleased with seventh in the Mercedes, but then came the championship contenders. A mistake put Sebastian Vettel sixth, and it was a tough day for his Red Bull team as Mark Webber could only qualify fourth in the sister RB6. The two McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button had chosen completely different car set ups, and it did not work out for Hamilton who could qualify only fifth. It was looking good for Ferrari in front of their home crowd, and Felipe Massa qualified third. It was their day as Button was pipped to pole by Fernando Alonso, the 19th pole of the Spaniard's career.\nRace.\nAt the start of the race, Jenson Button had a fantastic start, jumping his McLaren from second past Fernando Alonso's Ferrari. Alonso, who was alongside his teammate Felipe Massa through the turn one chicane, just clipped the rear of Button's diffuser, but there was only light damage to the McLaren. As the pack headed down to the second chicane of turns three and four, Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton, who was in fourth, tried to pull a move on Massa, but there was contact between the two. Although Lewis tried to carry on, the front track rod was broken and he pulled up at the next corner. Massa managed to carry on unscathed. Kamui Kobayashi did start the race but retired his BMW Sauber on the first lap with a gearbox failure.\nMeanwhile, Mark Webber in the Red Bull was going backwards from his fourth place grid slot, and he was ninth at the end of the first lap. He soon re-passed Michael Schumacher's Mercedes at the second chicane on lap 6, with a calm and collected move on the seven times world champion. A hydraulic failure made Bruno Senna's HRT the race's third retirement on lap 11.\nAlonso was harrying Button all the way, and drama occurred further back on lap 20 as Webber's teammate Sebastian Vettel, who had also had a bad start, dropping from 6th to 7th and was harrying Nico Hülkenberg in the Williams to take the place back, complained of an engine issue in the Red Bull's Renault power unit. Webber sailed past and Vettel was just dropping back into the clutches of compatriot Schumacher when he suddenly regained power, and began to close in on Hülkenberg and Webber.\nButton made his pit stop on lap 36, and by staying out for one lap longer Alonso rejoined ahead of Button after his stop, although his teammate Massa actually held 1st for two laps before his own pit-stop relegated him back to 3rd. It was very tight as Alonso exited the pits, but the Spaniard just managed to stay ahead by holding the racing line as the two were side by side through turns one and two. Jarno Trulli was the race's next retirement in the Lotus with a gearbox failure on lap 46.\nAfter even more off track adventures for Hülkenberg, he was finally passed by Webber with just four laps to go, and the Aussie was visibly frustrated by then. On the same lap, Lucas di Grassi's Virgin suffered a suspension failure. After his phantom technical failure, the Red Bull mechanics had decided to leave Vettel's stop to the last lap, which they did, and the gamble paid off handsomely as the German emerged from the pits still in fourth place, ahead of his teammate.\nAlonso crossed the line in first place to the delight of the Tifosi, with Button still less than three seconds in arrears. Massa was third to complete a fantastic double home podium for the Scuderia, while Vettel drove a brilliant recovery drive to bring the Red Bull home fourth, holding off a late challenge from Nico Rosberg, who had had a quiet race for Mercedes. Webber, Hülkenberg and Robert Kubica's Renault were all in close attendance, while Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello's Williams rounded out the points.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:\nRace.\n Kamui Kobayashi started from the pit lane.\n Di Grassi was classified for completing 90% of the race winner's distance."

        "text": "The 2010 Singapore Grand Prix (formally the 2010 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 September 2010, at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Marina Bay, Singapore. It was the fifteenth race of the 2010 Formula One World Championship, and the third Singapore Grand Prix held as part of the Formula One World Championship. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso won the 61-lap race from pole position. Sebastian Vettel finished second for Red Bull and his teammate Mark Webber was third.\nAlonso held off Vettel to maintain his start line advantage on the first lap. Lewis Hamilton, who started third, fought off teammate Jenson Button to retain his start position. The top two remained the same through the first and only round of pit stops. Webber's team, Red Bull, opted to pit him early allowing him to move ahead of Hamilton. The race was neutralised by the deployment of the safety car after Kamui Kobayashi and Bruno Senna crashed on lap 31. Hamilton retired after a collision with Webber shortly after the race restarted on lap 36. Alonso maintained the lead for the remainder of the race under pressure from Vettel.\nThe race was Alonso's second consecutive victory and his fourth of the 2010 season; he had started from pole position to win the two weeks earlier. The win moved Alonso to second place in the World Drivers' Championship, eleven points behind leader Webber. Hamilton's retirement dropped him to third, while Vettel's second-place finish moved him to fourth past Jenson Button. In the Constructors' Championship, Red Bull extended its lead over McLaren to 24 points, with Ferrari a further 40 points behind, with four races remaining in the season. Alonso's Grand Slam was the last by a Ferrari driver until Charles Leclerc at the 2022 Australian Grand Prix.\nBackground.\nThe Singapore Grand Prix was the fifteenth round of the 2010 Formula One World Championship after taking a two-week break from the previous race in Italy. The event was held at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore, on 26 September 2010. The Grand Prix was contested by twelve teams with two drivers each. The teams, also known as constructors, were McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Williams, Renault, Force India, Toro Rosso, Lotus, Hispania, Sauber, and Virgin. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the green-striped side-walled super soft \"options\" and medium \"primes\" dry compounds, and the intermediate and full wet green-lined wet-weather compounds to the Grand Prix. The rules of 2010 Grand Prix races stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre during a race unless the driver used any one of two wet-weather compounds. Each driver was limited to eleven sets of dry tyres for the weekend.\nBefore the race, Red Bull driver Mark Webber led the Drivers' Championship with 187 points. He was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in second with 182 points and Fernando Alonso in third on 166 points. Hamilton's teammate Jenson Button was fourth with 165 points, and Sebastian Vettel was fifth on 163 points. Red Bull was leading the Constructors' Championship with 350 points; McLaren and Ferrari were second and third with 347 and 290 points respectively, while Mercedes on 158 and Renault with 127 points contended for fourth position.\nSingapore was a critical race in the championship as all five drivers had a chance to take the lead with a victory. The situation was made difficult for Alonso as he had used his allocation of eight engines following the Italian Grand Prix, and to replace one would incur a ten-place grid penalty. His rivals each had at least one untouched engine in reserve; Webber had two. Nevertheless, Alonso set himself the target to score points in Singapore. He also acknowledged that his car was not the fastest in the field and felt he needed five podiums in the season's five remaining races. Webber stated that he expected Singapore to be a tough weekend for him after he had retired from the event in 2008 and 2009, but felt there was still some time before a driver clinched the championship. After crashing out of the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton said he would push hard to stay in championship contention: \"I'll take each race as it comes, but I'll also be making sure I get to the finish of the next five races, that's more important than anything. I go to Singapore to win.\" Hamilton felt Alonso was the favourite to win the Grand Prix and viewed the latter as his main rival for the Drivers' Championship which was shared by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Button himself believed Alonso would have an extra advantage as the latter's teammate Felipe Massa was out of contention for the title.\nThe Marina Bay Street Circuit was resurfaced between turns three and seven, along with turns thirteen to seventeen, after drivers complained about its bumpiness following the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. The Singapore Sling chicane was adjusted to allow for a more gradual curve to exist which enabled a safer exit for drivers. The outside wall at turn 21 was brought closer towards the race track to cover up half of a drain which was previously exposed to cars, and the pit lane was resurfaced to allow for a smoother exit for drivers rejoining the circuit. Hamilton, a vocal critic of the circuit's condition, described it as \"dangerous\" because it had remained uneven, and said the Singapore Sling chicane was \"the worst corner I have ever driven in Formula One\" despite the safety modifications made to it. The organisers of the Singapore Grand Prix introduced a new machine to clean the surface of the track after drivers had problems with a dusty and slippery track surface in the previous year's race. Two days before the first practice session, drivers expressed concerns over low visibility caused by rain showers combined with the glare from the circuit lighting.\nThere were two driver changes for the Grand Prix. Hispania Racing announced that Sakon Yamamoto, one of the team's drivers since the tenth race of the season, was to be replaced for the weekend by the team's reserve driver Christian Klien because he was suffering from food poisoning. Several journalists noticed a seemingly healthy Yamamoto in the paddock, suggesting that he had been dropped for sponsorship reasons instead. Team principal Colin Kolles confirmed that the arrangement would be for one race and Yamamoto would return to the cockpit at Suzuka. Pedro de la Rosa was summarily dropped by Sauber and replaced by Pirelli test driver Nick Heidfeld, who last drove for the Sauber team in . The change was made because of de la Rosa's poor performance relative to that of teammate Kamui Kobayashi, and Heidfeld's knowledge of the Marina Bay Street Circuit and the Yas Marina Circuit.\nSeveral teams made modifications to their cars in preparation for the event. McLaren, Red Bull, and Williams all revised their front wings. McLaren's revision was designed to separate airflow into two separate channels, with both directing airflow around the outside of the car's front tyres. Red Bull's design, used in the Friday practice sessions, had two vertical slots to the rear of its endplate along with another to avoid creating a vortex when it operated with the planes and endplate. A previous design, debuted at the , was used both in qualifying and in the race. In addition, the team used a revised diffuser to allow for better management of airflow to the top of the diffuser's side section. Williams's design debuted for the first time and was designed to make the tyre act like a diffuser which took air in to improve its efficiency.\nPractice.\nThere were three practice sessions held in accordance with the 2010 regulations: two 90-minute sessions on Friday morning and afternoon and one 60-minute session on Saturday morning. The first practice session was initially held on a wet track with a clear sky after rainstorms earlier in the day left standing water on parts of the circuit, and high humidity slowed the drying process. These conditions meant drivers used intermediate tyres first before dry tyres were utilised in the session's closing minutes. Webber set the fastest time of the first session with a late lap of 1 minute and 54.589 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second who was briefly quickest before Webber set his lap. Adrian Sutil, with a lap of 1:58.827, was third fastest, ahead of Vettel and Jaime Alguersuari. Button, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Sébastien Buemi, Kubica, and Vitaly Petrov rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers.\nIn the second practice session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest time of the night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton, Barrichello and Massa were in positions five to seven. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a safe position on the circuit.\nRain hit the circuit on Saturday afternoon, ending three hours before the session started, resulting in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates making it difficult for drivers to tell precisely how wet or dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton, Massa, Rosberg, Webber, Nico Hülkenberg, Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available.\nQualifying.\nSaturday evening's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first part lasted twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished eighteenth or lower. The second session lasting fifteen minutes eliminated cars from eleventh to seventeenth. The final ten-minute session set pole position to tenth. Cars which competed in the final session were not allowed to change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in dry weather conditions. Alonso was fastest in the first and third sessions, and clinched his second consecutive pole position with a lap time of 1:45.390 which he set on his first run of the third session. He was restricted to one timed lap in the second session because of an engine mapping problem, which meant Ferrari immediately re-programmed Alonso's engine upon discovering the issue. Alonso was joined on the front row of the grid by Vettel, who recorded a lap 0.067 seconds slower, and felt he could have taken pole position as he misjudged a gap while following Schumacher and brushed a wall exiting the Singapore Sling chicane. Hamilton qualified third and was happy with his starting position despite losing downforce on the track's final sector while running in teammate Button's tow. Button secured fourth and pushed hard in the final session which meant he had slight damage to his rear tyres on his first run, and could not get the optimum tyre temperature in the first section on his second run. Webber managed fifth and admitted that he was struggling to find a good rhythm when driving the circuit. Barrichello qualified in sixth. The two Mercedes drivers took seventh and ninth; Rosberg ahead of Schumacher. Rosberg believed that he should have performed better in qualifying than in the practice session, as he felt the soft tyres lacked grip; Schumacher was satisfied with his qualifying performance. The Mercedes drivers were separated by Kubica, in the faster Renault, who was happy with his lap time despite his car sliding from a lack of grip. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten qualifiers.\nAlguersuari, who qualified eleventh, was the fastest driver not advancing to the final session. His best time of 1:47.666 was 1.8 seconds slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alguersuari's time was followed by Hülkenberg, who was backed up by Sutil on his first run in the second session, and described his car's balance like \"night and day\". Hülkenberg was demoted five positions on the grid after the Williams team changed his gearbox after the race at Monza. As a consequence, Petrov inherited 12th position having pushed hard on a set of option tyres. He had lost control of his car after he went deep, under braking, heading for turn five (a corner that was damp from the earlier rain shower), with his right-rear wheel hitting the wall. Petrov's crash meant he took no further part in qualifying. He was ahead of Buemi, in the slower of the two Toro Rossos, who lost a large amount of grip and got stuck in traffic. Heidfeld took 14th ahead of his fellow countryman Sutil in 15th. Liuzzi had a problem with his front brakes on the first run of the second session and managed 16th. Timo Glock, Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas di Grassi were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying. The eleventh row of the grid was filled by Jarno Trulli and Klien. Senna took 23rd. Massa was unable to set a timed lap as his gearbox seized without warning forcing him to stop on the circuit; Ferrari chose to replace his engine and gearbox as a precaution. Massa's engine change was his ninth of the season which incurred a ten-place grid penalty, but since he started from 24th position, the penalty was nullified.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions is denoted in bold.\nNotes\nRace.\nThe race began at 20:00 Singapore Standard Time (UTC+8). The conditions on the grid were dry and cloudy before the race; the air temperature ranged between and the track temperature was ; no rain was predicted during the race. Most drivers started on the super-soft compound tyre. Alguersuari started from the pit lane as his team discovered a coolant leak in his car. As the five red lights went out to signal the start of the race, Alonso maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner and withstood Vettel's attempt to pass him. Button got an early advantage over teammate Hamilton, but Hamilton fought him to retain third place. Barrichello fell from sixth to eighth place. Kubica passed Rosberg at the start but the German regained sixth position in the same lap. Further down the field, the early momentum was broken when Heidfeld, attempting to overtake both Force India cars at turn seven, hit Sutil's rear, damaging his front wing. Liuzzi subsequently went into Heidfeld's rear-end after the latter squeezed him towards the wall, causing front wing damage to his car. Heidfeld made a pit stop for a replacement front wing at the end of lap one, while Massa made his sole pit stop for the medium compound tyres.\nLiuzzi pulled over to the inside of the circuit on the third lap, at turn ten, with left-rear suspension damage resulting from contact with the wall. His retirement triggered the deployment of the safety car as marshals were required to push his car away from the track. Webber was the only top running driver to pit for the medium compound tyres during the safety car period on lap four. Red Bull had told Webber to enter the pit lane, assuring him that it was the right decision, though he questioned the move. Several drivers towards the rear also chose to pit. Racing resumed at the end of lap five when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Webber immediately pushed hard and passed Glock for tenth position and a line of cars began to form behind Glock. Alonso began to pull away from Vettel as he set consecutive fastest laps. Webber passed Kobayashi at turn five to move into ninth on lap seven, and withstood an attempt to Kobayashi to reclaim ninth heading into turn seven. Hülkenberg and Petrov's wheels made contact and both drivers went off the circuit on the same lap; Hülkenberg managed to move ahead of Petrov with Massa taking advantage to pass Petrov. Webber caught Schumacher on lap 11 and passed the latter on the same lap at turn five after Schumacher ran wide. Vettel was told by his team to cool his brakes on the same lap as Alonso continued to extend his lead. Sutil got ahead of Glock for eleventh place three laps later and started to pull away from the queue behind Glock. Hülkenberg ran wide at turn seven on the same lap but did not lose any positions. Hülkenberg passed Glock in the first sector of the track for twelfth on lap 16.\nVettel and Alonso traded fastest laps as they pushed hard in their efforts to build up a sufficient lead over Webber to maintain first and second positions after their pit stops. Massa, Petrov, Buemi and Alguersuari all passed Glock on lap 17 thus eliminating the queue of cars. By lap 20, Alonso was leading Vettel by 3.2 seconds; he, in turn, was a further 11 seconds in front of Hamilton. Button was in fourth, 20 seconds behind Alonso, with Rosberg 3.3 seconds behind the World Champion in fifth. Webber changed his engine settings to give him a higher top speed in an attempt to get past Barrichello and decrease the time gap to Hamilton on lap 22. He avoided colliding with an Armco barrier at the entry of turn eighteen one lap later. Hamilton was told to increase his pace on the 24th lap to try to stay ahead of Webber after the pit stop phase. But his car had a large amount of oversteer, as his rear, super-soft, compound tyres began to deteriorate, causing his lap times to drop off the leader's pace. Trulli drove to the pit lane and was pushed by his mechanics into the Lotus garage to retire with a hydraulic issue on lap 28. Hamilton made the first scheduled stop for tyres on lap 29 and re-emerged in eighth position behind Webber. Alonso and Vettel made simultaneous pit stops on the following lap; Alonso retained his lead despite Vettel's pit crew completing their pit stop first; Vettel avoided stalling and drove away in second gear. With newer tyres which provided more grip, Vettel recorded faster lap times than Alonso to close the time gap as the two came across slower cars.\nKobayashi attempted to pass around the outside of Schumacher on lap 31 but the two made contact with Schumacher subsequently hitting a barrier. Kobayashi damaged his Sauber, losing control of his rear-end, and crashed at the exit of turn 18 after his front wing was knocked off entering the corner. Senna was slow to react and buried his Hispania nose-first into the barrier alongside Kobayashi. These incidents called for the race's second safety car period to allow removal of both cars from the circuit which were on the racing line. Klien was pushed into his garage to retire with a hydraulic problem on lap 34. The safety car pulled into the pit lane at the end of lap 35 and the race resumed with Alonso leading. Hamilton got a run on Webber who was caught behind di Grassi and lined up an overtaking manoeuvre on Webber, and overtook him on the Raffles Boulevard straight. Webber's front-right tyre hit Hamilton's left-rear tyre at turn seven. He escaped without significant damage, while Hamilton had a punctured tyre and pulled off the circuit to retire for the second consecutive race. Webber felt vibrations on the front of his Red Bull car. His tyre, which made contact with Hamilton's, had been pushed off its normal mounting on the rim, and Button drew closer to Webber who managed to maintain a good pace. On lap 37, Schumacher ran into the rear of Heidfeld's car and limped back to the pit lane to replace his damaged front wing creating sparks as it was dragged along the surface of the track, while Heidfeld retired after hitting a barrier. Button was urged by his McLaren mechanics on lap 42 to push Webber whose tyres were older, while Vettel gradually closed the gap with Alonso. Hülkenberg, in ninth, made an error on lap 44 which allowed Massa to momentarily take advantage, but he fought back to retain ninth position. Kubica sustained a right-rear puncture on lap 46 and made a pit stop on the same lap, rejoining in 13th. \nUpfront, Vettel had reduced the gap between himself and Alonso to one second by lap 50 as the pair continued to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit and drove to the pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica passed Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) within nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and vacated his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.\nVettel drew to within two-tenths of a second behind Alonso as the final lap started, and came across Sutil, Hülkenberg, Petrov and Massa; both drivers managed to get past Petrov, and Alonso maintained the first position heading into the final sector of the track. The yellow flag for Kovalainen's car meant that Vettel's final chance of an overtake, into the final corner, was denied, and Alonso took the checkered flag on lap 61 to win the race, 0.293 seconds ahead of Vettel. Alonso secured his first grand chelem (winning the race from pole position with the fastest lap, while also leading every lap of the race) of his career, which was Ferrari's last until the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix, as well as the first since the 2008 French Grand Prix (both achieved across two drivers). Webber was third, 1.2 seconds ahead of Button in fourth. Rosberg, Barrichello and Kubica took the next three positions. Sutil held off Hülkenberg in the final sector of the track for eighth and ninth on the line with Massa in tenth. Petrov, Alguersuari, Schumacher and Buemi finished one lap behind Alonso, with di Grassi and Kovalainen (despite his retirement) the last of the classified finishers.\nPost-race.\nThe top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Alonso said that his victory \"meant a lot\" for him to remain in contention for the Drivers' Championship and thanked his team for their efforts during the weekend. Alonso added that Ferrari would give \"100 per cent\" in the season's four remaining races and said the battle remained \"very tight\" despite scoring the most points out of all the drivers in the previous five races. Vettel said that he was hoping that Alonso would make a mistake but acknowledged that it was difficult to overtake on the circuit. He also said that attempting to overtake Alonso in the final stages of the race was \"the only chance\" that he had of winning the race and hoped that the remaining tracks would suit his Red Bull car. Webber stated that he was \"very happy\" with his third-place finish and said the entire race weekend was the toughest of the year on him. He also said that he did not feel comfortable throughout the weekend and that he was staying composed through certain sections of the race.\nAlonso's win has been regarded as one of the best of his Formula One career. Former Formula One driver Martin Brundle described it as: \"one of those races in which two drivers elevate themselves on to a separate plane from their rivals.\" It reminded him of the 2000 Japanese Grand Prix where Schumacher won that year's world championship from his main rival Mika Häkkinen. Will Saunders of \"crash.net\" said in 2014 that Alonso: \"had little right to wrestle a performance of such magnitude out of either himself or the Ferrari, yet he found another level that day.\" After the eventual conclusion of the championship in Vettel's favour by four points, Saunders said: \"Alonso's performance in Singapore showed he would have been an equally deserving championship victor.\" \"ESPN\" listed it as one of Alonso's top ten races while driving for Ferrari.\nThe stewards immediately investigated the accident between Webber and Hamilton on lap 37 and took no further action. Hamilton later reviewed the incident on video and was adamant that he was not at fault saying that he was \"unlucky\" for the second consecutive Grand Prix. Webber stated the contact nearly forced him to retire and compared the accident to Hamilton's collision with Massa at the Italian Grand Prix. Brundle felt Hamilton should have given Webber more space and agreed with the stewards' decision. Bridgestone director of motorsport tyre development Hirohide Hamashima stated Webber was \"very lucky\" to make the finish and that if left hand high-speed corners were installed on the track, the tyre would have moved more frequently and lost its pressure. Horner had also admitted that Webber had been lucky with his tyre lasting for a long distance.\nSchumacher and Heidfeld's accident on lap 37 was investigated by the stewards who took no further action after deciding it was a \"racing incident\". Heidfeld felt Schumacher had braked too late and hoped that he would have had a better finishing position. Schumacher himself said that he was unhappy with his first race in Singapore but enjoyed the second half of the race. BBC pundit and former team principal, Eddie Jordan was highly critical of Schumacher arguing that the latter should have been sacked by Mercedes to prevent him from being \"slaughtered\" in the event he was unable to win another race. Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn came to Schumacher's defense and said his team was \"happy\" with his contribution. Motorsport pundits criticised Kovalainen's decision to stop his car on the pit straight after it had caught fire and argued that he was \"irresponsible\". Kovalainen defended his action arguing that it had not been safe to drive his Lotus into the pitlane. Nevertheless, Kovalainen's fire was voted the Moment of the Year by readers of \"Autosport\" magazine in December 2010 at the Autosport Awards held in London.\nSutil was given a 20-second time penalty by the stewards as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner-cutting. This ruling demoted Hülkenberg to tenth while Massa moved to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted that he was at fault and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi's accident and felt his own crash was unavoidable.\nAs a consequence of the race, Webber increased his lead in the World Drivers' Championship. Alonso's victory moved him into second place, eleven points behind Webber. Hamilton's retirement dropped him to third place, nine points behind Alonso. Vettel's second-place finish moved him to fourth place, ahead of Button. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull drew further ahead of McLaren who was now twenty-four points behind. Ferrari remained in third on 319 points, forty points behind McLaren. Mercedes increased their points advantage over Renault to thirty-five with four races remaining in the season.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold.\nNotes"

        "text": "The 2010 Japanese Grand Prix (officially the 2010 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 October 2010 at the Suzuka Circuit, Suzuka, Mie, Japan before 190,000 spectators. It was the 16th round of the 2010 Formula One World Championship and the 26th Japanese Grand Prix held as part of the Formula One World Championship. Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel won the 53-lap race from pole position. His team-mate Mark Webber finished second and Fernando Alonso was third in a Ferrari.\nEntering the race, Webber led Alonso in the World Drivers' Championship by 11 points. Webber's team Red Bull led second-placed McLaren by 24 points in the World Constructors' Championship. Vettel claimed the 13th pole position of his career by setting qualifying's fastest lap which was delayed to the day of the race due to torrential rain. Vettel held the lead for the first 24 laps until he made his only pit stop, promoting Webber to first for one lap. Jenson Button of McLaren led the following 13 laps before Vettel retook the position on the 39th lap, maintaining it for the rest of the race to achieve his third victory of the season and the eighth of his career. The safety car was deployed once for two separate accidents on the first lap involving Vitaly Petrov and Nico Hülkenberg as well as Felipe Massa and Vitantonio Liuzzi.\nAs a consequence of the final result, Webber extended his lead over Alonso to 14 points in the World Drivers' Championship. Vettel's victory promoted him from fourth to third and he had the same number of points as Alonso. McLaren's Lewis Hamilton was demoted to fourth as a result of his finishing fifth, and his teammate Button remained in fifth. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull further increased their lead over McLaren to 45 points, with three races remaining in the season.\nBackground.\nThe 2010 Japanese Grand Prix was the 16th of 19 single seater motor races of the 2010 Formula One World Championship, and the 26th running of the event as part of the Formula One World Championship. It was held at the 18-turn clockwise Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Mie on 10 October. Tyre supplier Bridgestone provided four types of tyres to the race; two dry compounds (soft green-banded \"options\" and hard \"primes\") and wet-weather compounds (intermediate and full wet green-line central groove banded tyre).\nFor the 2010 race, a kerb was installed in place of an existing kerb and green concrete sections at the exits to the Denger 1 and Spoon corners were each elongated by . Two layers of artificial grass laid on the outside of the Spoon corner was extended with another layer of artificial grass laid behind the kerbing to the exit of the Casio Triangle chicane, extending its overall length by more than . Conveyor belts were retrofitted to the front of tyre walls that had previously lacked them.\nPre-race, Red Bull driver Mark Webber led the World Drivers' Championship with 202 points; ahead of the second-placed Fernando Alonso of Ferrari with 191 points. McLaren's Lewis Hamilton held third with 182 points, Webber's teammate Sebastian Vettel was fourth with 181 points and Hamilton's teammate Jenson Button placed fifth with 177 points. Red Bull led the World Constructors' Championship with 383 points; McLaren and Ferrari were second and third with 359 and 319 points, respectively. With 168 points, Mercedes in fourth had 35 more points than Renault in fifth.\nAlonso had won the preceding Italian and to be eleven points behind Webber and said the season's final four rounds would challenge him mentally believing a top-three result and figuring his championship position in Abu Dhabi was vital. Webber admitted Ferrari's recent form had given them momentum but felt Red Bull would be competitive in Japan, saying they needed to extract performance. His teammate Vettel said he felt he could win the title and noted the importance of finishing races and driver optimisation. He acknowledged Red Bull's car was suited to the Suzuka Circuit and said his focus would be on the Japanese round. Hamilton, who was intrigued to learn he remained in the championship battle after failing to finish the previous two , sought a victory duel in Japan and hoped for a marked improvement. His teammate Button said he acknowledged a potential championship win even though he was 25 points behind Webber and felt the Suzuka Circuit where he had not achieved a race victory suited his driving style.\nSome teams modified their cars for the Grand Prix. Adrian Newey, Red Bull's technical director, moved the RB6's front brake calipers backwards to a vertical position to prevent mechanical failures associated with the brake discs, pads and pistons moving more. Both Vettel and Webber had two separate diffusers and rear wing specialisations and a revised rear wing featuring a delta shaped beam wing in the centre. Ferrari modified the F10's diffuser to include a small omega shaped wing on the deformable structure's top to bring about a slight increase in downforce. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic package featuring a new front wing, lengthened exhausts, a new engine cover and rear wing with angled gills. The squad chose to use the standard version for qualifying and the race.\nA total of 12 constructors and 24 drivers participated with one driver change and a single free practice entrant. Having driven one of its cars at the preceding Singapore Grand Prix, local driver Sakon Yamamoto replaced Christian Klien as partner for Bruno Senna at Hispania Racing. Lucas di Grassi was replaced for the second successive first free practice session by GP2 Series driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio at Virgin Racing to allow the latter to undergo evaluation as a driver. Paul di Resta did not partake in the first practice session for the Force India team for the second successive Grand Prix, to allow the team's regular drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Adrian Sutil to test new car aerodynamic updates.\nPractice.\nThere were three practice sessions held in accordance with the 2010 regulations: two 90-minute sessions on Friday morning and afternoon and one 60-minute session on Saturday morning. In the first practice session, held in dry weather, Vettel lapped fastest at 1 minute, 32.585 seconds which he set approximately halfway through the session. His teammate Webber was 0.048 seconds slower in second and Renault's Robert Kubica was third. Sutil, Hamilton, the Williams duo of Rubens Barrichello and Nico Hülkenberg, Mercedes' Michael Schumacher, Sauber's Nick Heidfeld and Schumacher's teammate Nico Rosberg followed in the top ten. Halfway through the session, Hamilton lost control of his car when it bottomed out and went wide into the quick downhill double right-hand Denger corner, damaging the car's front-left corner in a major collision with the tyre wall. His car was transported back to the pit lane by tractor and therefore took no further part in the session. With three minutes remaining, Hamilton's teammate Button ran over the kerbs at Denger One turn but regained control of his car and avoided the barrier by stopping in the gravel.\nVettel was the early pace setter in the second practice session with a 1-minute, 32.210-second lap time recorded on 20 minutes on hard compound tyres before Webber's lap of 1 minute, 31.860 seconds, also set on hard compound tyres, led overall after an hour. After changing to the soft compound tyres, Vettel set the overall fastest lap of 1 minute, 31.465 seconds with 20 minutes remaining. Webber, Kubica, Alonso, Ferrari's Felipe Massa, Button, Renault's Vitaly Petrov, Schumacher, Sutil and Hülkenberg made up second through tenth. During the session, Schumacher ran wide on the kerb between both of the apexes at Denger turn but did not hit the wall. Hamilton was required to miss most of the session as his team's mechanics reconstructed his vehicle after his first practice session accident. He partook in the final eight minutes and set seven laps to be 13th quickest.\nWet weather arrived at the circuit early in the morning of 9 October; the rain got heavier before the final practice session began and worsened throughout the session, causing low visibility. The safety car was used to assess the track conditions prior to the session's commencement. Due to rivers running across multiple turns and puddles causing aquaplaning, teams were reluctant to send drivers onto the circuit and two competitors set lap times. Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari lapped fastest at 1 minute, 55.902 seconds, followed by Virgin Racing's Timo Glock. Several participants chose to use wet-weather tyres for one exploratory lap before re-entering the pit lane. Hamilton reported the conditions made the track undriveable, and Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn said he would be disappointed if qualifying was staged in such weather and suggested the starting order be determined by either holding qualifying on Sunday morning or by championship standings.\nQualifying.\nInclement weather continued to disrupt the Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed three times every half an hour while the safety car was deployed several times to assess the conditions before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)'s race director Charlie Whiting on safety grounds arising from fading light levels. Many figures in Formula One agreed with the decision to postpone qualifying, with drivers such as Button, Hamilton, Schumacher and Vettel noting that they would not be able to control their vehicles in torrential rain had the session be run. Williams technical director Sam Michael proposed the re-introduction of slower monsoon tyres to enable drivers to drive in severe weather. Local driver Kamui Kobayashi for Sauber said he felt sorry for attendees seated in the grandstands not witnessing any action.\nThe qualifying session was split into three parts. The first session ran for 20 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 18th or lower. The second session was 15 minutes long, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 17th. The final ten-minute session determined pole position to tenth. Cars in the final session were not allowed to change tyres before the start of the race, using the set with which they set their quickest lap times. All vehicles were not required to enter \"parc fermé\" conditions with the FIA conducting surveillance via CCTV cameras installed in every garage. Therefore, teams were allowed to adjust their cars until qualifying was over. Clear and sunny weather allowed qualifying to commence at the new start time of 10:00.\nVettel took his eighth pole position of the season and the 13th of his career. He set a lap of 1 minute, 30.792 seconds that he subsequently improved by seven-thousandths of a second by not slowing through the first corner. Vettel was joined on the grid's front row by Webber who was 0.078 seconds slower than his teammate after losing time in the final third of the lap. Hamilton qualified in provisional third place by being faster than both Red Bull drivers for of the lap. Kubica took fourth in a car setup for maximum speed in a straight line. He demoted Alonso to fifth who was fastest overall in the middle of the lap but slower elsewhere. Button felt better driving on the hard compound tyres and had more fuel in his car than his teammate Hamilton to set the sixth-fastest qualifying time on his final timed effort. Rosberg felt his car was balanced and was seventh with the Williams duo of Barrichello and Hülkenberg (who complained he was blocked by Hamilton on his last timed lap into the chicane) eighth and ninth. Schumacher took tenth due to an improperly working F-duct system.\nHeidfeld in 11th used the soft compound tyres but was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten since Schumacher's final lap in the second session prevented him from advancing to the final session. 12th-placed Massa could not qualify higher due to slower cars impeding him and causing him to make an error at Casio Triangle turn during his first timed lap. Petrov in 13th was 1.2 seconds slower than teammate Kubica, with Kobayashi looking set to advance to the final session before a minor error at Casio Triangle corner left him 14th. Sutil, 15th, reported he could not generate tyre temperature, and Alguersuari used a different car mechanical balance to claim 16th and qualify higher than his teammate Sébastien Buemi for the fourth time in the previous six . Liuzzi was 17th and half a second slower than teammate Sutil. Buemi failed to qualify past the first session due to a mechanical fault with his car's floor and his being slowed in the first third of the lap. The two Lotus cars of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen were 19th and 20th. Di Grassi in 21st qualified higher than Virgin Racing teammate Glock for the second time in 2010 in 22nd after the latter was dissatisfied with his car's setup. The Hispania Racing duo of Senna and Yamamoto completed the starting lineup in 23rd and 24th.\nPost-qualifying.\nAfter qualifying, Hamilton was demoted five starting places because McLaren opted to change the gearbox he had used in Singapore for a new one after detecting worsening abnormal gearbox oil pressure in his vehicle during the third practice session; the problem could not be rectified before qualifying. This demoted Hamilton from third to eighth. The Williams team filed a protest with the FIA stewards for Hamilton's perceived blocking of Hülkenberg in the final qualifying session. The stewards did not find any evidence that Hamilton violated the regulations and thus did not penalise him.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions is denoted in bold.\nNote:\nRace.\nThe 53-lap, race started at 15:00 local time, attended by 190,000 spectators. The weather conditions at the Grand Prix's start were sunny, with the ambient temperature between and the track temperature from ; weather forecasts suggested no rainfall during the event. A total of 24 drivers were due to take the start but di Grassi, on his formation lap, went wide off the track onto the artificial grass at the exit of 130R corner, possibly due to him driving onto some moisture on the outside kerb. The resulting impact against the tyre barrier destroyed his car. Di Grassi was unhurt but he did not start and his car was removed from the circuit by crane and marshals cleared the crash scene. Every driver in the top ten, except for Button, began on the soft compound tyre. Amateur footage observed Vettel almost jumping the start before the event commenced.\nWhen the five red lights went out to begin the Grand Prix, Vettel made a brisk getaway to maintain the lead into the first corner. Behind him, Kubica overtook Webber for second, but he could not challenge Vettel for first into the first turn. Two separate accidents occurring further down the order promoted the safety car's deployment. Petrov made a brisk start but came across the front of Hülkenberg and collided with the corner of the latter's car while trying to pass him. Petrov speared left into the outside barriers on the main straight and crashed as Hülkenberg retired with damaged front suspension. Massa was given less room trying to pass the slow-starting Rosberg and had to drive onto the grass on the track's inside. This caused him to lose control of his car and hit the side of Liuzzi's vehicle. Liuzzi and Massa were unhurt. During the safety car period, Rosberg, Trulli, Glock and Senna made pit stops for the hard compound tyres. Drivers on the soft tyres had an advantage since the safety car's slower speed meant the tyres would have longer optimal performance. On the third lap, Kubica retired when his right-rear wheel detached into the hairpin due to insufficient torque on the wheel nut loosened by incorrect wheel gun settings.\nThe safety car was withdrawn at the conclusion of the sixth lap and racing resumed with Vettel leading his teammate Webber, and Alonso. On lap seven, Rosberg attempted to pass Buemi on the outside into 130R corner but ran wide onto the damp artificial grass and returned to 13th place. His teammate Schumacher overtook Barrichello's hard-to-handle car at the final chicane with some minor contact for sixth position and maintained the place into the first corner. At the conclusion of the lap, Vettel led Webber by nine-tenths of a second, which he extended to two seconds by the 13th lap's start. On the same lap, Kobayashi overtook Alguersuari on the inside for tenth into the hairpin as the two drivers made slight contact. Barrichello in seventh was delaying Heidfeld, Sutil and Algersuari. Sutil went off the circuit at the final corner on lap 16 but remained in ninth. Two laps later, Kobayashi overtook Sutil on the inside for ninth into the hairpin. Sutil drew alongside Kobayashi into Spoon corner but could not retake ninth by passing Kobayashi.\nPit stops began on lap 19 when Sutil and Heidfeld stopped for hard compound tyres. Newer hard compound tyres were quicker than worn soft tyres dictating the first driver to make a pit stop would gain a significant advantage. While Sutil went fastest overall in the second half of the lap, suggesting newer hard compound tyres had more performance, no leading drivers decided to do pit stops. This was due to there being half the race left and both Red Bull cars were eight seconds ahead of Alonso and could remain on track to react to any of Ferrari's actions. Williams reacted to Heidfeld's stop and called Barrichello into the pit lane from seventh for the hard compound tyres on the 21st lap. Barrichello's slower pace left him behind Heidfeld in 12th. This unhindered Kobayashi who required 20 seconds over Sutil but the latter's pace and the former being slowed produced a 17-second gap. Hamilton made a pit stop for the hard compound tyres on lap 23 and fell to seventh behind Kobayashi. This forced Hamilton not to use the additional grip provided by his tyres immediately.\nOn lap 24, Schumacher made a pit stop for the hard compound tyres from fifth. He rejoined the track behind his teammate Rosberg in ninth, allowing Red Bull to conduct their own pit stops at a convenient time for them. On lap 25, Vettel and Alonso made their pit stops from first and third, emerging in third and fourth respectively with Webber taking over the lead. Hamilton slipstreamed Kobayashi on the main straight and overtook him on the inside into the first turn for sixth on that lap. On lap 27, Rosberg blocked an overtake by his faster teammate Schumacher entering the Casio Triangle chicane and again into the first turn by putting Schumacher onto the outside. As a consequence of his strategy allowing him to drive on the same set of tyres for longer on the circuit, Button was now leading and had to pull away from Alonso and Hamilton to remain ahead of both drivers following his pit stop. The Red Bull duo were informed of the possibility of Button not making his pit stop until the final lap in order to slow them and put them under pressure from Alonso and Hamilton. Button was not able to set the lap times to achieve the distance needed due to track evolution.\nAt the conclusion of the 38th lap, Button made his pit stop from the lead for the soft compound tyres. He returned to the track in fifth as Vettel retook the lead and Webber returned to second. Kobayashi made his pit stop from sixth on the same lap and rejoined the race in 12th. Hamilton radioed his team that he could not use third gear due to a possible dog-ring breakage; he had to rely on fourth gear to finish the race. This allowed Hamilton's teammate Button on soft tyres to close up and pass him at the hairpin for fourth on the 44th lap when Hamilton went wide at the corner. On the following lap, Kobayashi overtook Algersuari on the outside into the hairpin with aid from a slower car for eleventh. Both drivers made slight contact exiting the corner. The contact removed Kobayashi's turning vain. Sutil was close behind Barrichello in ninth when an oil pipe in his car failed into 130R turn, causing smoke to billow from his rear of his engine. He spun through 360 degrees on his car's own oil in 130R corner as it laid oil on the racing line before he retired in the pit lane. Sutil's retirement promoted Kobayashi to tenth as Alguersuari made a pit stop to repair front wing damage sustained in the collision with Kobayashi.\nAs Rosberg drove uphill towards the high-speed left-hand Esses on lap 48, the car's left-rear wheel detached due to a possible hub failure, causing him to strike the turn five tyre wall at approximately . Rosberg was unhurt since his car remained upright. On the following lap, Kobayashi overtook Barrichello for eighth braking for the hairpin. He then passed teammate Heidfeld approaching the hairpin for seventh on the 50th lap. At the front, Vettel finished first to achieve his third victory of the season and the eighth of his career in a time of 1 hour, 30 minutes and 27.323 seconds at an average speed of . Webber followed 0.905 seconds later in second and set the race's fastest lap at 1 minute, 33.474 seconds on the final lap. Alonso took third with McLaren's Button and Hamilton fourth and fifth. Schumacher achieved his best result since the five months earlier in sixth. The last of the drivers who scored points were Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Barrichello and Buemi in seventh through tenth. Alguersuari, Kovalainen, Trulli made up positions 11th to 13th. Glock, 14th, held off Senna in 15th, who had brake issues preventing him from passing. Yamamoto, slowed by a fuel pressure decrease, and Rosberg were the last two classified finishers.\nPost-race.\nThe top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Vettel said achieving a brisk start was key to victory and heralded \"an incredible day\" for his team: \"It was down to the team. They have been working very hard, most of the guys they didn't sleep the Thursday until the Saturday, so it was good there was no qualifying as they didn't have to touch the car and got some sleep. I think they deserve it today.\" Webber commented on his delight at finishing second and noted the circuit layout stopped him from passing his teammate. He said he needed to win in the future but observed that reliability had the potential to factor in the championship duel. Alonso revealed he made a slow getaway but felt his team had to be satisfied with his coming third despite lacking pace: \"We saw we were struggling today: in Q1 we were P7, we saw problems also for Felipe in Q2, so it was maybe not an ideal weekend in terms of pace and we lost three points in the championship, but overall we have to be extremely happy.\"\nHamilton spoke of his fear, due to the noises he could hear coming from his gearbox, that he would not finish the event, but said he was satisfied to finish and remained optimistic about his title chances: \"There are still three races to go and 75 points available, so we'll remain optimistic and keep doing the best job we can. I'll keep fighting.\" His teammate Button believed other drivers would struggle on the soft compound tyres and would need to review the data to determine why he remained on the circuit for a long period of time, saying: \"It was quite a tough race on such old tyres. I don't mean we would have finished any further up but I think it is just useful information for the future.\" Kobayashi said he was happy to finish seventh: \"It was a great race for our team, and I'm very pleased for the Japanese fans who have watched an exciting race. It is the second time we have got both cars in the points, and for me it was really something to come back here and race for the first time after seven years in front of my home crowd.\" Both James Key and Monisha Kaltenborn said they were impressed with Kobayashi's driving and overtakes. Kaltenborn expressed hope Kobayashi's performance would result in Japanese sponsors supporting the driver.\nThe FIA stewards investigated both of the first lap collisions. They deemed Petrov responsible for causing the accident with Hülkenberg and imposed a five-place grid penalty on him for the following . The stewards decided the collision between Liuzzi and Massa was \"a racing incident\". Massa commented on the moments before colliding with Liuzzi: \"I saw that Sutil was on the left so when I saw him I tried to go to the right, because Rosberg was going to the left as well. But then when he saw that Sutil was alongside and that I was on the right, so anticipated a little bit the corner and then I had no space.\" Liuzzi remarked that Massa \"seemed to come into my side like a bullet\" and believed the former had no control of his vehicle. Éric Boullier, the Renault team principal, thought Kubica could have achieved a top-three result had he not retired but doubted his pace could have been enough to challenge the Red Bull team: \"we still need to work a lot to make the car much easier to drive for our drivers. I think we can expect a couple of results before the end of the season.\" Di Grassi said driver error was not a consequence of his reconnaissance lap accident.\nThe final result of the Grand Prix meant Webber with 220 points extended his lead over Alonso in the World Drivers' Championship to 14 points with his teammate Vettel moving from fourth to third to tie Alonso with 206 points. As a result of his finishing fifth, Hamilton with 192 points was demoted from third to fourth and his teammate Button with 189 points remained in fifth. Red Bull further increased their World Constructors' Championship gap over McLaren in second by 45 points. Ferrari remained in third with 334 points while Mercedes in fourth had 176 points and Renault were fifth with 133 points with three races left in the season.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold."

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Glenn McGrath",
        "text": "Glenn McGrath, a retired international Australian cricketer, took a number of five-wicket hauls during his career. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and fewer than 40 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers.\nMcGrath made his Test debut in November 1993, against New Zealand, but it was not until March 1995 that he took his first five-wicket haul in Australia's victory over the West Indies in Barbados; his performance earned him the man of the match award. He followed that three weeks later with six wickets in a defeat in Trinidad. McGrath took 10 of his 29 Test five-wicket hauls in The Ashes (the traditional name for Test matches between Australia and England). During the 1997 Ashes series, McGrath \"humiliated\" England, taking eight wickets in a single innings at Lord's and restricting England to 77, the lowest total in any Test match at the ground since 1888. A month later, he dismissed seven English batsmen in the first innings at The Oval but despite these performances, Australia did not win either Test match. The 2001 Ashes series saw McGrath make four five-wicket hauls in consecutive matches. He twice took five-wicket hauls in both innings of a Test match – in March 1999 he dismissed five West Indian batsmen in each innings of the first Test of the Frank Worrell Trophy; in the following year, he took ten wickets against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nHaving made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 1993, McGrath took his first one-day five-wicket haul in the following year, in the final of the Will's Triangular Series against Pakistan. Australia won each of the seven ODI matches in which McGrath took a five-wicket haul, and McGrath was given the man of the match award on six of these occasions. Retiring from international cricket in 2007, he took 29 five-wicket hauls in Test cricket and 7 in ODIs. As of October 2009, he is fifth overall in all-time Test five-wicket haul takers, and fourth in the ODI list."

        "title": "Composite baseball bat",
        "text": "Composite baseball bats, opposed to aluminum or wood baseball bats, incorporate a reinforced carbon fiber polymer, or composite, into the bat's construction. This composite material can make up all or part of the bat. Bats made entirely of this polymer are referred to as composite bats. Bats which only incorporate a portion of polymer (and the rest either wood or an aluminum alloy) are referred to as composite hybrids.\nComposite bats can also be constructed to improve their trampoline effect over time. That advantage, namely the improved trampoline effect over a break in period, put the use of composite bats under further NCAA scrutiny during the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. Composite bats, tested after they were already broke in, showed performance standards well beyond the accepted ball exit speed ratio (BESR) Test.\nAs a result, a new standard, known as the batted-ball coefficient of restitution (BBCOR), was put in place in 2011 which required an accelerated break in period and testing to measure the trampoline effect of composite bats. Since the new restrictions on composite baseball bats NCAA hitting production has been noticeably dampened.\nHistory.\nComposite bats have been around as early as the 1980s for use in slow-pitch softball. Most notably, Louisville Slugger developed a slow-pitch bat that was awarded best performance at the 2001 Bat Wars. Mike responded in 2002 by developing their own composite softball bat. Even though composite material has only been historically used in slow-pitch and softball, this technology has emerged in little league, high school and collegiate baseball as early as 2000. Baum Bat invented the 1st composite wood bat in 1991 with partnership with Major League Baseball.\nDesign.\nThe design of a composite bat depends on which league it is suitable for play. Composite bats are used in a number of different leagues. Most Little League programs have governing rules concerning composite bats. High school (NFHS) and Collegiate play are governed under the BBCOR standards. Metal or composite bats are not allowed in the MLB or its affiliates. MLB or affiliates for short season and rookie ball does allow a select few composite wood bats. An example of MLB approved composite wood bat would be the Baum Bat.\nTo be suitable for play in BBCOR leagues (NCAA, NFHS, etc.), for example, composite bats must meet certain requirements. Many of these requirements are the same as their aluminum or wood counterparts. For example, the bat's weight to length ratio, known as the drop (length in inches - weight in ounces), must equal negative three. Meaning, a bat with a 33-inch length must weigh 30 ounces. Further, no bat's barrel diameter, at any point, can be greater than 2 5/8 inches. For composite bats there is added scrutiny. Specifically, the rebound rate or trampoline effect, after an accelerated break in period, must stay under certain requirements.\nLittle League International has a different standard for composite bat allowance in its leagues. Composite bats must meet an accelerated break standard set by the USA Baseball organization and be stamped with an official USA Baseball logo. Other bat dimensions are akin to wood and aluminum alloy requirements (length, barrel diameter, etc.).\nDisadvantages.\nWhen it comes to a bat's performance there are very few disadvantages in the use of a composite bat. The most notable concern is the use in cold temperatures. The polymers used in composite bats can be susceptible to cracking if used in cold temperatures.\nPlayer safety is another matter altogether. In December 2010, Little League Baseball announced a moratorium on the use of composite bats due to concerns about safety of young players. The increased batted ball speed from bats designed with composite materials introduced increased risk to fielders and especially to the pitcher. For a few years, Little League independently tested composite bats and published a list of approved bats. Starting in 2018, Little League, along with most other youth baseball leagues, have switched to the USABat standard, which is like BBCOR for lighter weight bats, keeps the trampoline effect under what Little League Baseball considers a safe level. Some youth baseball leagues have not adopted the USABat standard, staying with the older USSSA BPF 1.15 standard which is more akin to the old high school BESR standard, and allow bats with considerably higher trampoline effects.\nAdvantages.\nThere are many advantages to using composite baseball bats. As has been chronicled in slow-pitch softball recently, composite bats have outperformed standard aluminum bats. There are five main advantages for using composite bats: swing weight, trampoline effect, bending stiffness, bending vibrations, and sound.\nSwing weight.\nThe swing weight of a baseball bat deals with how heavy the bat \"feels\" when swinging. The swing weight is measured around a certain pivot point along the bat. Once a pivot point is determined (usually 6 inches for baseball bats) the bats balance point, total weight and the amount of time it takes for the bat to swing from side to side like a pendulum are used to determine its 'swing weight', or as some refer to it, its mass moment of inertia.\nBat manufacturers can adjust a composite bat's swing weight by changing how the weight is distributed along the bat. Composite bats can control their swing weight (through weight distribution) more effectively than aluminum and wood since composite material is lighter and more easily manipulated.\nTrampoline effect.\nThe trampoline effect, which is common terminology for baseball players, is the phenomenon when the baseball \"jumps\" off the bat at contact. The bat-ball collision can be demonstrated from the physics of elastic collisions. The stiffer the barrel of the bat, the slower the baseball comes off the bat because it loses energy in the collision. The softer the barrel of the bat, the faster the baseball comes off the bat because it retains its energy applied by the pitcher. The trampoline effect has been experimentally tested, and results show that composite bats outperform all-aluminum bats. The reason why composite bats outperform other aluminum bats is that the trampoline effect can essentially be \"tuned.\" Composite materials have properties that are different in all directions, or anisotropy, which allows the bat manufacturer to design the bat stiff longitudinally (along the handle) and softer circumferentially (around the barrel). This softer barrel allows the ball to come off with less energy loss while maintaining the stiffness of the bat in the handle.\nVibration.\nBall players often experience a \"sting\" in their hands caused by vibrations when the ball does not come in contact with the sweet spot of the bat. The frequency of these vibrations throughout the bat is related to the bending stiffness. Daniel A. Russell of Kettering University has shown that standard aluminum bats have a high bending stiffness that produces vibrational frequencies in the range where most hands are sensitive; therefore, causing more sting. He also has shown that composite materials can lower this bending stiffness without compromising other advantages.\nIncluding the lower bending stiffness, composite baseball bats have a higher damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as more forgiving because if they do not make contact with the ball on the sweet spot, they will not feel the vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.\nFuture outlook.\nFor a time, the future of composite baseball bats at the collegiate level was in question. On July 22, 2009, the NCAA reported that the rules committee had requested to ban the use of composite bats. The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel found that 20 out of the 25 composite bats tested during the 2009 NCAA Division 1 Baseball Tournament failed the BESR (Ball Exit Speed Ratio) test. The tests showed that the balls were actually coming off the bat much quicker than what the specifications allowed. Since bats must pass the BESR specification at the factory before reaching the market, there are two possible hypotheses. One suggests that the performance of composite bats increases with repeated use; the other states that players are intentionally altering the composite bat. The most common method of altering composite bats is through bat rolling, where a large amount of pressure is applied, by various means, while rolling the bat back and forth. The rules committee met on August 17, 2009, to discuss their proposal with manufacturers, and on August 24, the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved a temporary ban on composite bats. During this temporary ban, the rules committee will continue testing the bats to determine if the performance is enhanced through repetitive use, or if intentional alteration seems more plausible. Currently, the NCAA is requiring that all composite bats meet BBCOR standards. See the Design section above for details.\nOn December 30, 2010, Little League officials announced a moratorium on using the bats in all divisions and during the Little League World Series. Several manufacturers of composite bats have subsequently obtained Little League International approval for specific composite bats.\nOn January 1, 2018, USA Baseball adopted a new bat standard. For Little League, Pony, Cal Ripken, Babe Ruth, Dixie, and AABC, new 2018 bats must be approved and showing a 2018 USA Bat Stamp. 2 5/8 barrel diameter is now available for play but parents should expect their kids' youth bats to perform at \"wood-like levels\", and is similar to BBCOR for lighter weight bats. USA Baseball has repeatedly stated that the USA Bat Standard is for the betterment of the sport because it will uphold the “long term integrity of the game” with injuries and financial profits not playing a role in the decision. Some leagues and tournament continue to allow the older USSSA 1.15 BPF bats which have considerably higher trampoline effect and are more similar to the old OWEN bats no longer allowed in high school and NCAA."

        "title": "Cycling in Copenhagen",
        "text": "Cycling in Copenhagen is – as with most cycling in Denmark – an important mode of transportation and a dominating feature of the cityscape, often noticed by visitors. The city offers a variety of favourable cycling conditions — dense urban proximities, short distances and flat terrain — along with an extensive and well-designed system of cycle tracks. This has earned it a reputation as one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. Every day 1.2 million kilometres (0.75 million miles) are cycled in Copenhagen, with 62% of all citizens commuting to work, school, or university by bicycle; in fact, almost as many people commute by bicycle in greater Copenhagen as do those cycle to work in the entire United States. Cycling is generally perceived as a healthier, more environmentally friendly, cheaper, and often quicker way to get around town than by using an automobile. \nHistory.\nBicycles became common in Copenhagen at the beginning of the twentieth century. The city's first bicycle path was established on Esplanaden in 1892, another early example are the paths established around The Lakes in 1910, when the existing bridle paths were converted into isolated cycleways to accommodate the heavy growth in cycling at the time. In 1890 there were 2,500 bicycles in the city, just 17 years later that figure had increased to 80,000. In the 1920s and 1930s the popularity increased even further. As a spectator sport, six-day racing became popular in the 1930s. The first race was held in 1934 in the original Forum Copenhagen and its popularity peaked in the 1960s. During World War II, petrol was strictly rationed, making cycling the dominant form of transportation in Copenhagen. Also during the 1940s, the first recreational bicycle routes were developed through green spaces in the periphery of the municipality.\nStarting in the 1950s, Copenhagen experienced a decline in utility cycling due to increasing wealth and affordability of motor vehicles. While no bike paths were actually removed at the time, new road construction omitted bicycle infrastructure, and many bike lanes were curtailed at intersections to increase the throughput of cars by adding turn pockets and other car related infrastructure in its place. At the same time car traffic increased dramatically on existing streets without bicycle infrastructure, decreasing the cyclists sense of safety on those streets. During the late 1960s and early 1970s the modal share of bicycles fell to an all-time low of 10%.\nWith the energy crisis, which hit Denmark harder than most countries, and the growing environmental movement in the 1970s, cycling experienced a renaissance. The government was forced to introduce car-free Sundays to conserve oil reserves. Many city dwellers thought it was the best day of the week, and the Danish Cyclists Federation which had been on life support for years and were nearly in a coma, experienced a rapid and massive increase in membership during the 1970s and 1980s. Bolstered by the increasing membership and new enthusiastic younger grassroots, it organised massive demonstrations in Copenhagen and other major cities, demanding better infrastructure and safety for the city's cyclists. Another grassroots action cited for helping cycling infrastructure on the political agenda was operation \"White Crosses\" where white crosses were painted on the streets where a cyclist had been killed in traffic. These protests and actions came at the same time as a number of planning reforms were initiated nationally, which gave individual citizens the opportunity to have direct influence on new planning and zoning laws in their communities, and with that came a clear demand for segregated cycle paths.\nAlthough the first separate cycle tracks were constructed much earlier, they did not become the norm until the early 1980s. As in many other cities planners suggested to avoid interfering with car traffic on the main roads, by using a \"back streets strategy\" of cycling routes on quiet residential streets, but uptake was low and the vast majority of cyclists refused to deviate from the more direct routes. Protests continued and on 4 June 1983 the Danish Cycling Federation, at a large bicycle demonstration, gave a \"Cyclist Award\" to Jens Kramer Mikkelsen in the form of a curb. Mikkelsen was the head of the traffic department and later lord mayor. The curb was placed on the bike lane on Amagerbrogade at the corner of Hollænderdybet. The gift was a symbol of the bicycle federations desire to have segregated bicycle facilities build on direct corridors, which happened to be along major streets, in order to make bicycle journeys competitive in time and effort. Politicians, although not very eager, gradually took up building cycle tracks on main roads and also began to develop its first coordinated strategies for increasing cycling in the municipality.\nSince 1995, when the city started its monitoring system, cycling has constantly risen, reaching 41% by 2004 and 50% by 2010 for residents living within the city of Copenhagen. In the 18 municipalities that make up the Copenhagen metropolitan region (Hovedstadsområdet) an area of approximately and a population of 1,2 million, 21% of all trips were done on bicycle by 2011. During the same period, from the 1980s until today, the network of cycle tracks and paths within the city of Copenhagen has almost doubled in length reaching in 2010\nMunicipal bicycle policy.\nThe city of Copenhagen released its first bicycle account in 1996, where the city for the first time began measuring 10 key indicators, chosen by the city's traffic department and a group of regular cyclists. Aside from factual information like the budget allocated to cycling infrastructure, the length of the bicycle network, modal share and the number of cyclists and accident statistics, it also contains surveys asking regular cyclists for their opinion on the infrastructure, maintenance, and their perceived sense of safety. It gives citizens an overview of the city's plans for cycling and, in later renditions, changes initiated since the previous account's publication. The city of Copenhagen has since released its bicycle account biennially, greatly increasing its scope in later editions.\nIn the municipal development plan from 1997, the city introduced a new concept of green bicycle routes, envisioned to be a coherent network of cycle routes that, to the extent possible, will be off-street routes through parks and other open green areas or, where this is not possible, to a limited extent along quiet streets with low traffic volumes. These routes are intended to be a supplement to the existing network centred around busy corridors with high volume vehicle traffic. In 2000 the city released a proposal for a network of 22 green bicycle routes with a total length of at a total estimated cost of 500 million DKK. As of 2012 around 40 km of network has been completed and the city is committed to completing the network in the coming years. The city hopes that the recreational and enhanced safety qualities of this network will attract certain groups of the population that currently use cars on trips to and from work, especially those with a 5–10 km commute.\nIn 2001 Copenhagen formulated its first bicycle strategy with the publishing of \"Cycle Policy 2002 – 2012\" as a way to prioritize cycling in city planning, signal its importance to the city, and to coordinate initiatives for improvements of cycling conditions. The city also vowed to use bicycle accounts to follow up on the goals set forth the cycle policy.\n Among these goals were an increase in modal share from 34% to 40%, a 50% decrease serious injuries or death, as well as targets for safety, comfort, and speed, measured in the surveys for the bicycle account.\nThe next development of the municipal bicycle policy came with the release of the \"Cycle Track Priority Plan 2006–2016\" which states the order in which almost of new cycle tracks and cycle lanes will be established in the 10 years covered by plan. The expansion of the bicycle network are prioritized by a number of indicators: the number of cyclists, accidents, sense of safety, coherence in the network and coordination with other projects done by the city. In 2009 the estimated cost of implementing the plan amounted to DKK 400 million.\nIn 2007, following a report on the effects of cycle tracks and bicycle lanes that identified a number of problems with the safety of the network, particularly in intersections, the city approved and released an \"Action Plan for Safe Bicycle Traffic 2007–2012\" to aid the city with the goal of reducing the number of accidents by 50% compared to 1996. The plan called for rebuilding streets and intersections throughout the city and identified 20 especially dangerous intersections in the city that would be rebuilt at a rate of 3 per year. It also called for safety and behavioural campaigns and strengthening the city's traffic department.\nCurrent bicycle strategy (2011–2025).\nOn 1 December 2011 the municipal council unanimously adopted the new cycling strategy, \"good, better, best – The City of Copenhagen's Bicycle Strategy 2011–2025\" which aims to make Copenhagen the world's best city to cycle in. The strategy replaces the previous cycling policy covering the years 2002 to 2012. To reach its goal, the city has chosen to focus on four core areas; city life, comfort, speed and safety\nThe main goal of the strategy is to increase the modal share of the bicycle to 50% of commuter trips, and make Copenhagen the best cycling city in the world. The city has used the biennial bicycle accounts to identify key problems that need to be addressed in order to increase the modal share, and plans employing a number of tools to reach its target. These include widening cycle tracks to 3 lanes to allow for conversational cycling and increase the sense of safety on the cycle tracks, while at the same time allowing for higher speeds among commuters. The city further plans to decrease travel times by expanding the use of green waves adjusted to cycling speeds, and building additional bicycle and pedestrian only bridges across busy streets and over the harbour and canals. The city also plans to increase safety by redesigning a number of intersections with a high number of accidents, and rebuilding school routes with safer infrastructure, and speed decreasing measures. Finally the strategy also aims to improve the chaotic bicycle parking conditions, by greatly expanding the number of parking spaces, especially in and around stations.\nImpact.\nHealth and welfare.\nThe Copenhagen City Heart Study involved 19,698 Copenhagen inhabitants aged 20–100 years in a cardiovascular population study and concluded that cycling at high or average speed increases life expectancy of the participants by 5 and 3 years respectively compared to those who cycle at low speed (4 and 2 respectively for women).\nSince the health care system in Denmark is both universal and tax payer funded, a major driver in the economics of bicycle promotion and investments, comes from savings in the health care system. One study has shown a decrease in mortality of 30% among adults who commute by bicycle daily. And the city estimates that for each kilometre cycled society saves 1.21 DKK in the health care system, added up that amounts to approximately DKK 534 million (US$91 million) of savings per year, in addition society gains from increased productivity of a healthier work force. Other savings come from reduced congestion and lower road infrastructure maintenance costs.\nEconomic impact.\nThe bicycle culture of Copenhagen brings both direct and derived economic benefits to the city. The city has estimated that every kilometre cycled brings a net gain for society of 1.22 DKK (US$0.21 per mile), compared to a net loss of 0.69 DKK for every kilometre driven in a car (US$0.12 per mile). These numbers include both savings in the public sector, and additional economic activity in the private sector.\nIn the private sector there are 289 bicycle shops and wholesale dealers in greater Copenhagen, as well as 20 companies that design and sell bicycles, mainly the city's signature cargo bikes, such as Christiania Bikes (Boxcycles in the U.S.), Nihola and Larry vs Harry (Bullitt) , and luxury bike brands as Biomega and Velorbis. These firms generate 650 full-time jobs and a total estimated annual turnover of DKK 1.3 billion (US$222 million).\nAdd to this the various forms of utility cycling in the city and specialized consultancy services, provided both partly by the public sector though the city itself and the cycling embassy to promote private sector solutions internationally, but also directly by private sector consultants, most notably Copenhagenize Consulting and Gehl Architects. The tourism sector is also regarded to both receive and provide additional economic benefits to the city. There are many bicycle rental shops which mainly cater to visitors and there are also a number of agencies providing bicycle tours of Copenhagen, creating additional jobs and economic activity. In addition, the positive branding effect of Copenhagen's bicycle culture is estimated to attract international conferences and hotel guests, although the city finds it difficult to assign a precise economic value to the positive branding of Copenhagen as a cycling city.\nUtility cycling.\nSeveral companies operate cycle rickshaws (velotaxis) in Copenhagen. While the business is currently unregulated, it is estimated that there were around 130 cycle taxis in Copenhagen in 2012. Recently the city has proposed organising the system in the inner medieval city with 26 designated bicycle taxi stands and require permits for their operation in order to address some of the problems created by their popularity. They offer similar advantages to taxis for passengers travelling a mile or three, and their novelty attracts tourists including those seeking a guided tour of the city centre.\nFollowing a liberalization in 2007, several entrepreneurs have jumped the opportunity and started to sell goods from custom build cargo bikes. Walking through the city you will find vendors selling hot coffee, chocolate, soup and pancakes from cargo bikes with gas stoves installed, cooled sushi and cocktails or pedal blended smoothies. As with the cycle taxis, there are now so many vendors that the city has started to limit their access to some parts of the city, where they, along with the bicycle taxis, have created access problems for pedestrians.\nAs in many other cities, another common phenomenon is bicycle messengers. A unique Copenhagen twist on the business that has been making rounds in the news and blogosphere is the famous custom build semen delivery bike from a local sperm bank. In addition, virtually all mail delivered by the Danish postal service is done on custom build bicycles, recently the company has introduced larger and more efficient electric cargo bikes, which won the \"Innovation of the Year\" prize at the annual post expo in 2012.\nSince 1 March 2009, Copenhagen has had police patrolling on bicycles. Besides being a quick and efficient means of transportation, it has been found to increase visibility and to improve contact with citizens. Other professions using cycling in their everyday work in Copenhagen include municipal supportive home caretakers who are required to be proficient bicyclists to be hired, the city also employs a large number of Street sweepers on specially build cargo bikes, and certain departments of the municipal administration requires certain trips, e.g. between meetings to be done by bicycle or foot, in accordance with the city's climate plan.\nInfrastructure.\nBicycle infrastructure in Copenhagen currently includes approximately of curb segregated cycle tracks, of on-street cycle lanes and of off-street green bicycle routes running through parks and other green areas. In relation, Bremen with a very similar amount of population has of curb segregated cycle tracks, but only a bit above 26 % cycle traffic. According to the cycle track priority plan, the city of Copenhagen plans to expand this by of cycle tracks and of green bicycle routes by 2026 before it deems the network complete. The city allocated some DKK 75 million (approx. US$13M) to new or improved bike specific infrastructure and DKK 17 million (approx. US$2.3M) on operation and maintenance of the network in the 2013 budget.\nIt is worth noting that the contiguous urban area releases no unified statistics, and hence the size of network is considerably larger than most statistics show, since they cover only Copenhagen municipality itself, rather than the 18 municipalities that constitute the urban core of the capital region. The city of Frederiksberg for example includes an additional of cycle track and paths and actually has the highest modal share in the country, exceeding that of the city of Copenhagen which surrounds it. Additionally, the suburban Albertslund Municipality has a unique network of separated alignments with level-free crossings through around 130 bridges and tunnels.\nCycle tracks.\nRoadside tracks.\nRoadside cycle tracks in Copenhagen are generally one-directional (see Google Maps' orthophotos), with one cycle track on each side of street flowing the same direction as motor traffic. Legally, the minimum width is , but in practice most cycle tracks are at least , preferably , and very busy stretches of cycle tracks can be wide. Cycle tracks in Copenhagen are separated from car lanes by a high stone curb and the sidewalk by another curb. They are by and large of a uniform design, in order to give cyclists a good idea of what any particular route will look like. Where roadside parking is available cycle tracks run on the inside of the row of parked cars, between parking and the sidewalk, essentially using parked cars as a separation barrier between bicycles and vehicle traffic. As most cars are single occupancy, this also aids to prevent dooring accidents, as the driver exits the car on the opposite side of the cycle track.\nIndependent bikeways.\nA few spectacular bikeways are not adjacent to streets. Nørrebroruten is a dedicated bike route on an abandoned railway track and so has few road crossings. Cykelslangen (\"Bikesnake\") is a viaduct, partly across and partly longitudinal above port basins. Therefore, both are among the rare bidirectional bikeways inside Copenhagen.\nSafety.\nWhile installation of a new cycle track in the city decreases the number of accidents along the cycle track itself beyond the expected number of accidents, a study of newly installed bicycle tracks in Copenhagen actually showed, taking into account correction factors for crash trends, traffic volumes and regression-to-the-mean, that the number of accidents increased by 9% compared to the expected number of accidents (without new cycle path). There was a significant increase of accidents in intersections following the installation of cycle tracks at intersections when corrected for traffic volumes.\n Since its publication, the city has used the conclusions of the report to improve safety in intersections. Notable improvements include rebuilding dangerous intersections, pulling back stop lines for cars to improve visibility of cyclists, and expanding the use of bicycle traffic lights, to give pre-greens for cyclists. Overall there were 92 cyclists involved serious injury and 3 deaths in 2010, down from 252 incidents in 1996, when the city began a concerted effort to bring down the number of injuries. A cyclist will now on average cycle before being involved in a serious accident.\nSuper bikeways.\nThe Cycle Super Highways are a series of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs. This initiative began in 2009 when both Copenhagen and the neighboring cities realized that building new infrastructure would allow commuters to bike into the city and create more sustainable transportation options. Since traffic planners believe it will be very difficult to raise the modal share substantially beyond the current 50% for its own residents, the city has begun targeting commuters entering the city from surrounding municipalities on trips in the range, aiming to increase the number of bicycle commuters by 30% throughout the capital region. The project involves a network of 26 named and signposted routes following a uniform standard with high maintenance and good services such as automatic air-pumps and prioritized snow removal. While international media has created some hyperbole around the concept, labelling the network as bicycle superhighways, they are largely not grade separated. Rather the routes are regular cycle tracks receiving smaller targeted upgrades.\nCycle parking.\nAlthough visitors may be surprised by the apparently large number of cycle parking facilities in Copenhagen, there is in fact a severe lack of available cycle stands, and among the subjective indicators measured by the city, bicycle parking fares worst, with only 29% being satisfied with the facilities. There are approximately 560.000 bicycles in the city of Copenhagen, more bicycles than people, yet they share only 48.000 bicycle stands. With a view to remedying the situation, in 2008 the Danish Cyclists Federation published a \"Bicycling Parking Manual\" with a number of guidelines. They are of immediate practical use to today's users but they also offer advice for city planners wishing to improve facilities in the future. A number of projects have been launched to ease Copenhagen's notorious shortage of bicycle parking spaces, particularly at transport hubs. While the city expects there will always be more bicycles in Copenhagen than parking spots, it hopes to increase satisfaction with bicycle parking significantly by 2025, through a coordinated effort to improve conditions and facilities.\nIntegration.\nBicycles have been admitted on the city's train network for some time to facilitate mixed-mode commuting, and in 2010, the state railways (DSB), made it free to bring bicycles on the train. Since then the number of passengers bringing a bicycle on the train have more than tripled, growing from 2.1 million to 7.3 million in 2012. To accommodate the growing number of bikes, DSB rebuilt all their S-trains by adding an extra carriage specifically for bikes, while keeping the flexible compartments at each end of the train to accommodate bicycles, as well as prams and wheelchairs, and increased capacity from 22 to 46 bicycles per train. Building on the success, DSB has launched additional bicycle initiatives such as opening bike shops in 10 stations, where customers can leave bikes for repair on their morning commute and retrieve them on their way home. The company has also introduced various bicycle discounts in their loyalty programme, vowed to install ramps on all stairs and drastically expand bicycle parking at stations.\nOther trains serving the metropolitan area, including the metro, also accept bikes. Bicycles are permitted on the city's water buses, known as the Copenhagen Harbour Buses, and since 2011 it has also been possible to bring bicycles on the city's network of commuter express buses, labelled S-Buses, but unlike the s-train they levy a fee of DKK 12 (approx. USD 2), and only commuter trains — along with the s-trains — are exempt from a rush hour curfew. In addition 15% of train passengers in the metropolitan region cycle to the station. Taxis are required by law to carry a bike rack, and passengers can bring a bicycle for a small fee.\nPublic bicycles.\nCopenhagen currently offers \"Bycyklen\", a bicycle sharing system which launched on 1 April 2014 with electric bicycles equipped with a GPS routing device. Unlike its predecessor, Copenhagen City Bikes, this system is not free.\nWhile Copenhagen City Bikes was considered one of the first examples of modern bike share systems, it was also of little or no use to commuters, and was mainly seen as serving tourists and casual users since it was primarily designed to prevent bike theft. This was set to change with the city's new bike share system opening in 2013, to be designed specifically for commuters, in order to function as a range extender for the public transit system. With that in mind, the cities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg appointed the operator of the S-train system, DSB to both tender and subsequently run the system. In 2013, a new system, Bycyklen, provided by Gobike was established, once fully installed it will provide 1,260 modern bikes with aluminium frame, adjustable seat-height and GPS-guidance. As of December 2022 they are no longer operating.\nInfluence.\nCopenhagen's relatively well-developed bicycle culture has given rise to the term \"Copenhagenization\". This is the practice where other cities try to follow the example Copenhagen has set in recent decades, by moving from their own (often long-held) car-centric transport policies to those that attempt to greatly increase the number of journeys by bicycle; they do this by developing bicycle infrastructure and/or improving their current bicycle infrastructure just as Copenhagen has done and continues to do. An example of a city which has introduced bike lanes acknowledging inspiration from Copenhagen is Melbourne in Australia where kerbside bike lanes separated from moving and parked cars by a low concrete kerb are referred to as 'Copenhagen lanes'. The concept of \"Copenhagenization\" has been featured by CNNs Richard Quest in the \"Futures Cities\" series and on Al Jazeera's Earthrise series.\nIn 2007 Copenhagen-based Danish urban design consultant Jan Gehl was hired by the New York City Department of Transportation to re-imagine New York City streets by introducing designs to improve life for pedestrians and cyclists. In this connection, Gehl took NYC planning chief Amanda Burden and transportation czar Janette Sadik-Khan on a bike trip around Copenhagen to show them what could be done for New York. Former British transport minister Andrew Adonis has also cycled the streets of Copenhagen in search of inspiration. As a result of Russian president Dmitri Medvedev's favorable impressions of Copenhagen's biking system during his visit to Denmark, 14 city bikes were sent to St Petersburg at the beginning of June 2010 where they will be available to citizens on an experimental basis. Medvedev believes the city bike approach could reduce traffic congestion in the city. The Danish pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai had been specially designed by BIG Architects. It allowed visitors to gain experience of cycling in Copenhagen by taking one of its 300 city bikes along the cycle paths which were incorporated throughout the structure. and city has since signed its first sister cities agreement with Beijing with a major goal of the cooperation being to provide inspiration to Beijing on how it can reintroduce the bicycle as a major mode of transport in the city.\nAnother influence on bicycle culture from Copenhagen is the \"cycle chic\" movement. It grew from reactions to a photo of a girl wearing her regular clothes on a bike, which inspired the photographer, Michael Colville-Andersen, to start the blog \"Copenhagen Cycle Chic\" featuring mainly female subjects riding their bikes in fashionable everyday clothes. Its popularity have spawned a global movement with over 100 cycle chic blogs featuring similarly themed photography from other cities and areas around the world. So now many people are making their own blogs that feature cyclists around the world. Most of them are associated with the original blog, the \"Copenhagen Cycle Chic\".\nCyclist behaviour.\nA criticism directed towards the cycling culture of Copenhagen is that the city's singular focus on bicycles has nourished a culture of bad behaviour among the city's cyclists, Mr Mikael le Dous, chairman of the \"Dansk Fodgænger Forbund\" (Danish Pedestrian Association) went so far as to call cyclists the \"plague of the pavement\", while another member claimed that the \"Cyclist has taken over everything\". In an article series on the subject run by Danish tabloid \"Ekstra Bladet\", the operative leader in the Copenhagen Police's traffic division called Copenhagen cyclists \"egoistic\" and called for a change in the cycle culture, and in another he named them the \"cuckoos of traffic\". According to a survey done by the municipality of Copenhagen in 2010, 55% of non-cycling Copenhageners found that more consideration towards others from cyclists would make the streets more safe, while the same number for automobiles was 27%. Among the cyclists themselves, 35% would like more consideration from other cyclists.\nContrary to this, however, a number of international observers have noted that in comparison to other countries, Copenhagen cyclists are very well behaved, and in a survey done by the Dutch \"Fietsberaad\" (Dutch National Bicycle Council) they noted that:\nSome observers such as British daily \"The Guardian\" and CNNs Richard Quest, as well as the city administration itself, has linked the issue of cyclist behaviour to the city's novel problem of bike congestion; \"there are simply too many bicycles\", relative to the infrastructure provided. During the morning and afternoon rush hour, it is not uncommon that there are too many cyclists for all to cross during green light cycles at intersections along the busy corridors. Another rush hour issue is lack of space on busy sections of the bicycle path network, with cyclists moving at different speeds without much leeway, creating an intimidating atmosphere for kids, the elderly and inexperienced cyclists. This in turn has created a conflict of space allocation, where cycling advocates claim that too little is done to accommodate the majority of cyclists and pedestrians since only 29.1% of the city's population own a car, while some motorists, including the Danish motoring association, feels that the capital hate cars, and that the city's accommodation of bicycles have already gone too far."

        "text": "The 2009–10 Providence Friars men's basketball team represented Providence College in the Big East Conference. The team finished with a 4–14 conference record and a 12–19 record overall.\nComing off his first season with the team that included a 19–14 record and a win over top-ranked Pittsburgh, coach Keno Davis returned just one starter and only seven players overall for the 2009–10 season. Departing seniors were guard Weyinmi Efejuku, guard Jeff Xavier, forward Jonathan Kale, forward Geoff McDermott, forward Randall Hanke, as well as forwards Chris Baudinet, Brian Beloin, and Connor Heine. Additionally, forward Alex Kellogg transferred to Ohio following two seasons with the Friars. On February 23, with four games remaining in the season, junior guard Kyle Wright left the team to focus on academics.\nStatistically, the Friars had the worst scoring defense in Big East history, surrendering 85.3 points per game against conference opponents. Numerous opposing players set career scoring highs in games against the Friars, including 46 points by South Florida guard Dominique Jones in an overtime game on January 23, two points shy of the conference record. On the offensive side of the ball, the Friars averaged 82.4 points per game in the regular season, the fourth-highest average in Division I. They did not receive votes in either the AP Poll or Coaches' Poll at any point in the season.\nThe Friars began their conference schedule with a 4–4 record, including a home win over #19 Connecticut on January 27. However, this would prove to be the Friars' final win of the season, as the team went on a 10-game losing streak, finishing 15th in the conference before losing to Seton Hall in the first round of the 2010 Big East men's basketball tournament. In the game, forward Jamine Peterson scored 38 points, the second most points in Big East tournament history.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big East regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big East tournament"

        "title": "List of athletes with the most appearances at Olympic Games",
        "text": "Only a small fraction of the world's population ever competes at the Olympic Games; an even smaller fraction competes in multiple Games. 861 athletes (601 men and 260 women) have participated in at least five Olympics from Athens 1896 to Beijing 2022, but excluding the 1906 Intercalated Games. 211 of these have gone on to make at least a sixth Olympic appearance.\nMultiple appearances.\nSeveral athletes would have made more appearances at the Olympics but for reasons out of their control, such as World Wars (no Olympics were held in 1916, 1940 or 1944), politically motivated boycotts, financial difficulties, or ill-timed injuries.\nCanadian equestrian athlete Ian Millar has competed at ten Olympic games. Austrian sailor Hubert Raudaschl, Latvian shooter Afanasijs Kuzmins (representing Soviet Union until 1988) and Georgian sports shooter Nino Salukvadze (representing Soviet Union in 1988 and Unified Team in 1992) have each made nine Olympic appearances.\nWell over half of six-time Olympians belong to the shooting, equestrian, sailing and fencing disciplines, which are known for allowing athletes more longevity at the elite level. Athletics and cross-country skiing also provide a large number of athletes who have competed at five Olympics.\nApproximately a quarter of long-competing athletes are female. Italian canoeist Josefa Idem became the first woman to take part in eight Olympics, eventually reaching the final of the K1-500m event at the age of 48. Before her, the closest a female athlete had come to competing at eight Olympics was 0.028 seconds, which was the time by which Jamaican-Slovenian sprinter Merlene Ottey had failed to meet the qualification time required for appearance at the 2008 Summer Olympics, at age 48. At the 2020 Summer Olympics, Georgian sports shooter Nino Salukvadze competed in her ninth consecutive Olympic Games at age 52, becoming the first female athlete in history to do so.\nFour six-time Olympians here have participated in Olympic Games over a period of 40 years: Bahamian sailor Durward Knowles (8 Olympics), Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm (8), Danish fencer Ivan Osiier (7), and Norwegian sailor Magnus Konow (6). Note should also be made of Japanese equestrian Hiroshi Hoketsu, whose first and third Olympic appearances in 1964 and 2012 were 48 years apart. Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina has competed at every Olympics from 1992-2020. She continues to compete at the elite level in her late 40s in a sport where few competitors continue past their mid-20s or compete at two or three Olympics.\nTwo five-time Olympians competed under four different flags at the Olympics, one of whom never actually changed nationality. Both shooter Jasna Šekarić (7 Olympics) and table tennis player Ilija Lupulesku (5) competed for Yugoslavia at the 1988 Olympics. In 1992, since Yugoslavia was under UN sanctions, they (and fifty other Serbians, Montenegrins and Macedonians) competed as Independent Olympic Participants before competing at the next Olympics under the flag of Serbia and Montenegro. Lupulesku became an American citizen and competed for the USA in 2004, while Šekarić finally competed for Serbia in 2008.\nTwenty-six five-time Olympians have won at least eight medals: American swimmer Michael Phelps (28), Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen (15), Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen (13), Italian fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti (13), Dutch speed skater Ireen Wüst (13), German kayaker Birgit Fischer (12), American swimmer Dara Torres (12), German equestrian Isabell Werth (12), American track and field athlete Allyson Felix (11), Italian short track speed skater Arianna Fontana (11), Hungarian fencer Aladár Gerevich (10), Italian cross-country skier Stefania Belmondo (10), Finnish gymnast Heikki Savolainen (9), Jamaican-Slovenian sprinter Merlene Ottey (9), German speed skater Claudia Pechstein (9), Italian fencer Valentina Vezzali (9), Dutch equestrian Anky van Grunsven (9), German biathlete Uschi Disl (9), Romanian rower Elisabeta Oleniuc (8), German equestrian Reiner Klimke (8), Italian fencer Giovanna Trillini (8), French fencer Philippe Cattiau (8), Jamaican track and field athlete Veronica Campbell-Brown (8), Russian diver Dmitri Sautin (8), Norwegian alpine skier Kjetil André Aamodt (8) and German biathlete Ricco Groß (8).\n56 athletes who have competed in at least five Olympics participated in two sports: 23 of them competing at both the Winter and Summer Olympics, 20 competing at the Summer Olympics and 13 competing at the Winter Olympics. The most common cross-over sports are athletics/bobsleigh (8 competitors) and cycling/speed skating (3 competitors).\nMarried couples among five-time Olympians include biathletes Ole Einar Bjørndalen (Norway) and Nathalie Santer-Bjørndalen (Italy/Belgium), Lithuanian pairs figure skaters Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas, Finnish cross-country skiers Harri Kirvesniemi and Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi-Hämäläinen, lugers Susi Erdmann (Germany) and Gerhard Plankensteiner (Italy).\nFamilial relationships among five-time Olympians include Belgian shooters François Lafortune Sr and Jr (father-son; with their brothers/uncles, they have seventeen Olympic appearances between them), Italian equestrians Piero and Raimondo d'Inzeo (brothers), British canoeists Andrew and Stephen Train (brothers), Greek shooters Alexandros and Ioannis Theofilakis (brothers), Italian cross-country skiers Sabina Valbusa-Fulvio Valbusa and Manuela Di Centa-Giorgio Di Centa (sister-brother), Brazilian equestrians Nelson and Rodrigo Pessoa (father-son), Austrian lugers Markus and Tobias Schiegl (cousins), Latvian skeleton racers Martins Dukurs and Tomass Dukurs (brothers). A more tenuous relationship is that of Argentine sailors Jorge Salas Chávez and Roberto Sieburger; Chávez's cousin Jorge del Río Salas (4 Olympics) married Sieburger's cousin Marylin Sieburger. (The extended Sieburger-Salas clan includes seven Argentinian sailors with twenty Olympic appearances.)\nList of athletes with at least six Olympic appearances.\nSo far, there have been 211 athletes who have appeared at Olympic Games at least six times. 61 of them have never won an Olympic medal. Athletes in bold are believed to be still active, i.e., have yet to announce their retirement. Female athletes are displayed with a pink background. Sorting is by number of appearances, Games of last appearance, date of birth.\nAthletes with at least five Olympic appearances.\n861 athletes have competed in at least five Olympic Games (870 if the 1906 Games are counted) between 1896 and 2022 inclusive.

        "title": "2009–10 Mid-American Conference men's basketball season",
        "text": "The 2009–10 Mid-American Conference men's basketball season is the 64th college basketball season in the conference's existence. The conference features 12 teams in two divisions, East and West, who compete for the Mid-American Conference (MAC) regular season and tournament titles. Kent State won the MAC regular season title with a record of 13–3. Ninth-seeded Ohio won the MAC tournament received the MAC's automatic bid into the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. There they defeated Georgetown 97–83 before losing to Tennessee in the second round. Armon Bassett of Ohio was named the tournament MVP.\nPre-season.\nCoaching.\nNone of the twelve teams made head coaching changes from last season, although some gave their coaches contract extensions. Ball State gave head coach Billy Taylor a two-year contract extension after the Cardinals shared the MAC West Division title with Central Michigan. Taylor finished second in the Coach of the Year ballot sponsored by the Conference and has held a 20–41 record since taking over the program. The contract extension will keep him at Ball State through March 31, 2014. Other changes with the Ball State program include Bob Simmons being promoted to associate head coach and Mitch Gilfillan hired as the Director of Basketball Operations.\nOn the east side, Bowling Green gave their head coach Louis Orr a two-year extension that would also keep him through the 2013–14 basketball season. He beat out Taylor for the MAC Coach of the Year ballot last season. In Orr's two seasons at Bowling Green he increased the team's conference winning percentage, going from 3–13 in the year prior to his arrival, to 7–9 and 11–5 in his two seasons at the institution. To complement the contract extension, Bowling Green announced that Dennis Hopson would join the Falcons as an assistant coach.\nThe Akron Zips gave their head coach Keith Dambrot a lengthy contract extension, keeping him through the 2015–16 season. Dambrot had led the Zips to four consecutive 20-win seasons in his five years at Akron (his first season had 19 wins). Those five years were capped off with an NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Tournament appearance in the 2008–09 season. However, the university lost a key assistant coach when it was announced that Jeff Boals would leave to become an assistant at Ohio State. Boals was a key figure in recruiting Zeke Marshall, a 7-foot center who has been Akron's highest recruit in recent history. To replace Boals, Akron hired Dan Peters, former Ohio State assistant coach who helped lead the team to the 2007 National Championship Game. Peters role with the Zips will be the Director of Basketball Operations.\nMedia voting.\nOn October 28, the members of the MAC News Media Panel voted in the Preseason Media Poll. They voted Akron as the favorite in the MAC East Division and Central Michigan in the MAC West Division. The Zips come off of a 2008 where they represented the Conference in the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, and Central Michigan won a share of the MAC West Division title last season.\nThe media also took a vote on who they think would win the MAC tournament at the end of the season. Unlike the preseason votes, the media would only select the winner of the tournament, and not the placement of the teams afterwards. Akron received the most votes with 19, followed by Buffalo with two votes. Northern Illinois, Kent State, and Bowling Green each received one vote to win the tournament.\nExhibition games.\nAll 12 MAC teams combined to play a total of 16 exhibition games. All of these games were against schools of lower divisions (NCAA Division II, for example). 15 of these 16 games were played in the home court of the MAC team, with the exclusion of a Kent State Golden Flashes game at the College of Wooster on November 7. Overall, MAC teams went 15–1 in these exhibition games, with the lone loss coming from the Toledo Rockets when they lost 48–56 against Central State University. The largest margin of victory was 50 points, which was achieved in two games. Northern Illinois was able to beat Marygrove College with a score of 120–70, and the Akron Zips were able to match that margin of victory with an 88–38 victory over Mount Union College.\nRegular season.\nNovember.\nFive Mid-American Conference teams opened up their season on November 13, the first Friday after the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season began. Miami first played the Tigers of Towson University in their home court in Maryland. While the RedHawks were able to build to a 42–37 lead at halftime, Towson would go on a 10–2 run in the second half and eventually sealing the victory with a final score of 82–71. Northern Illinois would also begin their season with a loss, losing 55–77 against intrastate opponent Northwestern Ohio began their season with a win Ohio Valley University by a score of 101–72 in the Convocation Center. Five Ohio players reached double-digits in scoring, led by Ivo Baltic who had 20 points in that game. Ball State was also able to begin the season with a victory, theirs over Horizon League opponent Valparaiso. Six players from Ball State were able to score over ten points, which is the first time in over ten years that it has been accomplished by a team. The Cardinals won by a score of 88–78. Finally, Kent State began their season by hosting a version of the 2009 Hispanic College Fund Classic. Their first match-up in that tournament was against the Samford Bulldogs. The Golden Flashes snuck out a win in that game, 69–66, to keep their home opener streak at 13 games.\nBracketBusters.\nFor the eighth year, ESPN organized an event that's known as the BracketBusters, which features teams from Mid-Major Conferences which face each other in order to improve their strength of schedule. The matchups will be announced on February 1 with the teams facing each other on February 19 or 20, 2010. The MAC is tied with the most teams in the event, with them and the Colonial Athletic Association having 12 teams each featured in the field.\nBall State, Bowling Green, Central Michigan, Kent State, Miami, and Ohio will all host games in their venues, while Akron, Buffalo, Eastern Michigan, Northern Illinois, Toledo, and Western Michigan travelling to opponents' arenas.\nAwards.\nAll-MAC Preseason Team.\nAs a part of the Preseason Media Poll, the members also voted on the Preseason All-MAC East and West Division teams. Akron and Eastern Michigan had two players in the East and West Division polls, respectively."

        "title": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1879",
        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1879 was the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire played their ninth season.\nOf the county sides Derbyshire played in the previous year they had matches against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However they did not play Hampshire or Kent. Derbyshire made a first innings total of 16 against Nottingham at Trent Bridge which remains a record for lowest number of runs in an innings for Derbyshire\n1879 season.\nDerbyshire played six county games in 1879, two each against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. They also played a first-class match against MCC. Derbyshire won both matches against Yorkshire, but lost to Nottingham and Lancashire (who shared the Champion County award) and MCC. Derbyshire also played two miscellaneous matches against their own colts and Harrow Wanderers, and a Derbyshire XI comprising most of the team played Bacup.\nRobert Smith was in his fourth year as captain. William Wood-Sims, a slater, Joseph Marlow and George Osborne made their first-class debuts for the club and went on to play several more seasons. Arthur Cursham, a mine manager, joined the club from Nottinghamshire but only played in two years. Conrad Wallroth who had appeared in the previous season played three first-class matches and Arthur Wood and Ralph Docker both played their only two first class matches for Derbyshire in 1879. \nJoseph Flint, who had first played in 1872 and Enoch Cook who had joined in the previous year both played their last first class matched for Derbyshire.\nIn their opening match against MCC, Derbyshire had MCC out for 60 in the first innings and made 83 in reply. MCC made 108 in the second innings and Derbyshire ended on 70 leaving them 15 runs behind. The next recorded match was a two-day internal fixture against the Derbyshire Colts who played with 22 men.

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1920 was the English cricket club Derbyshire's fiftieth season. It was the club's twenty-second season in the County Championship and the most disastrous season ever experienced by any side since the County Championship was established. Derbyshire lost 17 of the 18 matches played and the other was abandoned without a ball being bowled.\n1920 season.\nJohn Chapman was captain for the season, having held the post twice before World War I. The team was very unstable. Thirty eight players played for Derbyshire in the season, but only six played in more than half the matches. The club suffered from the absence of devastating bowler Billy Bestwick for all but one match, in which he took seven wickets, while other players such as Thomas Forrester and Arnold Warren were drawing to the end of their career. Leonard Oliver was top scorer and Arthur Morton with 89 wickets did the bulk of the bowling with Samuel Cadman. Oliver and Morton were the only players to score centuries.\nFifteen players made their debut in the season, half of them playing three or fewer matches. The most significant additions to the side were Harry Storer and wicket keeper Harry Elliott both of whom had long careers with the club and were members of the 1936 championship winning team. Newcomers Wilfred Carter, Jim Hutchinson, William Tomlinson, Anthony Jackson and Robert Bestwick played in several subsequent seasons. Those who only appeared in 1920 were Henry Radford, Kenneth Dobson and Douglas Linathan with three appearances, Albert Woodland and Allen Turner with two appearances and Geoffrey Brooke-Taylor, Timothy Boden and John Davis who only played one game each."

Katalin Deli was hired as the first coach in 1973 and quickly established the team as a contender for regional and conference titles; she was named Big Ten Coach of the Year for the 1989 and 1991 seasons. During her tenure Minnesota won three Big Ten conference titles as a team and Minnesota gymnasts won 21 individual event titles. Deli was fired following the 1992 season after gymnasts accidentally saw a sex tape of Deli and her husband, then-assistant coach Gabor Deli.\nJim Stephenson took over the program in 1993 and added his wife Meg Stephenson as co-head coach in 1998. Under the Stephensons, Minnesota advanced to the NCAA National Championships three times, finishing 10th in 1997, 9th in 2002, and 8th in 2013. Minnesota also added more Big Ten team titles, winning in 1998 and 2006. Jim stepped down as head coach in 2010, continuing to assist the team in a volunteer position.\nIn 2014, Meg Stephenson resigned due to controversy over her siding with her husband in a sexual harassment allegation, and allegedly retaliating against the student who made the claims. Assistant coach Jenny Hansen served as interim head coach for the 2015 season, before being officially promoted to the position.\nThe highest score ever recorded by the Minnesota gymnastics team is 197.750, at the 2021 conference championships."

Batten was educated at Haileybury School, before matriculating to St John's College, Cambridge in 1871. He received his BA (1st class) in 1875, becoming an Assistant Master at his old Secondary School, Haileybury. He left his post at Haileybury in 1877 and took up a similar role at Kelly College in Tavistock, Devon from 1877 to 1882; and then at Newton Abbott, 1883-1884. In 1884 he became the headmaster of Plymouth College, a position he held until 1889.\nRugby career.\nBatten first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Cambridge University while at St John's College. He won four sporting 'Blues' for rugby, and his first was in the very first Varsity Match between Cambridge and Oxford in 1872. Cambridge lost the first match, but Batten played in the next year's encounter and scored one of three tries in Cambridge's first Varsity Match victory. Batten played in both the 1874 and the 1875 matches, and was given the captaincy of the Cambridge team, both games ended in draws.\nBatten won his first and only international cap for England in 1874. The game was played against Scotland in the third encounter between the two teams, and only the third international rugby union game to be played. Batten was positioned in his usual role as fullback, and although England won narrowly, he was replaced for the next season's match by A.W. Pearson."

        "title": "Instant replay in Major League Baseball",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) uses instant replay review to allow league officials to review certain types of plays in order to determine the accuracy of the initial call of the umpires on the field. Reviews may be initiated either by a team's manager with limitations or by the umpires themselves. All instant replay reviews are examined by umpires at the Replay Command Center in New York City, who have the final decision as to whether to uphold or overturn the initial call.\nMLB was the last of the four major North American professional sports leagues to implement an instant replay review system. Instant replay review was first implemented during the 2008 season. Under that system, only the umpire crew chief could initiate a review, and one or more members of the umpiring crew would review the video at the stadium and render the decision to uphold or overturn the call. Only boundary home run calls could be reviewed, either if the initial call was a home run but might not have been (e.g., spectator interference or a foul ball near the foul pole) or if the initial call was not a home run but might have been (e.g., the ball hit an object such as a railing beyond the outfield wall and then bounced back onto the field).\nThe current instant replay system was implemented in the 2014 season. Under the current system, each manager is allotted one challenge per game, with additional challenges granted only if the previous one was successful. From the eighth inning on, the umpire crew chief is allowed to initiate his own replay review. The umpire crew chief is also allowed to initiate a review during any inning if the play in question is a boundary home run call.\nProcedure.\nThe following plays may be subjected to instant replay review:\nIn addition, the crew chief can use replay to review the following issues at any time, which is not considered a challenge:\nIn cases where an appeal is required by rule (e.g. missed base, tag-up), an appeal must be made, and it is the call on the appeal that is reviewed.\nTo initiate a manager's challenge, a manager must either enter the field of play and verbally tell the umpire he will use his challenge, or call or signal the challenge from the top of the dugout, within 30 seconds after the end of the play. Teams are allowed to have a replay assistant in the booth watch the replay and talk with a coach via the dugout telephone to decide if the team should challenge the call. A player or coach in the dugout will signal to the manager whether or not to use the challenge. The manager must signal to hold play within 10 seconds after the end of the play in order to wait for his replay booth's decision.\nWhen a play is reviewed, at least two umpires (including the crew chief) will go to an area behind home plate where they will meet a technician. The technician hands the umpires headsets where they can communicate with the umpires at the Replay Command Center in New York City. During the review, the replay may be displayed on the stadium video screen. Once the call is determined, the field technician will leave and the crew chief will signal the final call. If a manager enters the field of play to argue a reviewed call, he will be automatically ejected from the game.\nAfter being reviewed, umpires will call one of three review outcomes. If the play is confirmed, the umpire found clear and convincing evidence that the original call was correct. If the play is overturned, the umpire found clear and convincing evidence that the original call was incorrect. If the umpire found no clear evidence to overturn the call, the call stands.\nThe replay review lasts no more than two minutes. The clock begins after what is being challenged is established by the crew chief. There are a few exceptions to this time limit however, including placement of runners, multiple challenges, technology issues, rules application, and director discretion.\nSome plays are non-reviewable, so instant replay cannot be used. These plays include subjective calls, such as check swings, infield fly rule, and balls and strikes. Other calls that are considered non-reviewable are trap plays (infield), foul tips, and mound visit count.\nBackground.\nInstant replay in MLB actually had been used once before in the 1999 season during a Florida Marlins home game at Pro Player Stadium. This was the first instance in which instant replay was utilized in Major League Baseball. While playing the St. Louis Cardinals, Cliff Floyd hit a ball off the top of the left-field scoreboard. Originally ruled a double and then ruled a home run, National League umpire Frank Pulli changed the call back to a double after consulting a television camera near the Marlins' dugout. The Cardinals won the game, 5-2, and the Marlins protested the use of the TV monitor. The National League Office declared that the umpires erred in using instant replay, and the American League Office concurred that instant replay was not to be used in the future. However, the Marlins' protest was denied on the grounds that it was a judgment call rather than a rules violation as such, and the play stood. MLB did not use instant replay again for almost a decade.\nMajor League Baseball instant replay was instituted on August 28, 2008, by commissioner Bud Selig. \"I believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis,\" Selig said. \"The system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game.\"\nMLB was the last of the four major United States professional sports leagues to implement an instant replay review system. Replay was used 123 times between August 28, 2008, and the conclusion of the 2010 season (with 48 of those instances resulting in overturned calls).\nOfficial debut.\nReplay made its official, sanctioned MLB debut at Tropicana Field on September 3, 2008, after Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees hit a ball near the left-field foul pole that was initially ruled a home run by third base umpire Brian Runge. Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon and catcher Dioner Navarro argued that the ball was foul and asked for a review. After a conversation among the umpires, crew chief Charlie Reliford allowed the replay to take place and after review, upheld the home run call.\nThe first instance of an umpire's call being overturned by instant replay also occurred at Tropicana Field. On September 19, 2008, in the bottom of the 4th inning with two runners on base, Carlos Peña of the Rays hit the ball just over the fence in right field. The umpires originally ruled that there was spectator interference, but after several minutes of viewing replays, the umpires returned to the field and signaled it a home run, extending the Rays' lead to 9-0.\nAside from the two aforementioned reviews at Tampa Bay, review was used five additional times during the 2008 regular season: twice at Houston, and once each at Seattle, San Francisco, and Philadelphia.\nUse of instant replay.\nOn March 16, 2009, during the 2009 World Baseball Classic, instant replay was requested for the first time in the tournament's history at Dolphin Stadium to give Venezuela a home run against Puerto Rico. Crew chief Ed Rapuano stated in a postgame press conference that there was never any replay, because the \"war room\" in New York City was unable to send him a replay of the play in question due to technical difficulties. The umpires, two from the United States and two from Japan, then worked with a translator to make a final ruling. Three of the four umpires said they believed it was a home run, and when third-base umpire Hitoshi Watarida was asked by Rapuano if he was \"110 percent sure\" that it was a home run, Watarida said yes. Nearly 10 minutes after first entering the dugout, the umpires returned to the field and awarded the Venezuelan team with a home run.\nInstant replay instead made its WBC debut during the 2013 World Baseball Classic, as umpires upheld a home run call during a Mexico vs. USA game.\nOn June 19, 2009, instant replay was used twice in a game for the first time, during a Detroit Tigers versus Milwaukee Brewers game.\nOn October 31, 2009, instant replay was used for the first time in a World Series. In the fourth inning of Game 3 of the World Series, Alex Rodriguez hit a ball that bounced off the camera in right field. Initially called as a double, the umpires reviewed the play, and determined that had the camera not been in its location, the ball probably would have left the park, and a home run was awarded to Rodriguez, making the score 3-2.\nOn June 1, 2011, Billy Butler of the Kansas City Royals hit a fly ball to left field in the bottom of the ninth inning of a scoreless game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The ball hit off the fence over the left-field wall and skipped back onto the field. It was ruled a double and Jeff Francoeur held at third. Manager Ned Yost argued that it was a home run. After review, the umpires accordingly ruled a home run, granting the Royals a 2-0 victory. This was the second walk-off home run reviewed by instant replay in MLB history.\nOn August 18, 2011, Justin Morneau of the Minnesota Twins hit a deep fly ball to right field that appeared to go just to the right side of the foul pole for a foul ball in a game against the New York Yankees. However, the umpires immediately called it a home run. Yankees manager Joe Girardi came out to argue the call and ask for a review. The umpires reviewed and ruled that the ball did indeed go past the right side of the foul pole, thus calling it a foul ball. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire came out to argue the call and was ejected from the game by home plate umpire Brian O'Nora for arguing a decision to change a call after looking at instant replay, which pursuant to MLB rules, results in an automatic ejection.\nOn September 4, 2011, Hunter Pence of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a fly ball to deep right field. Originally ruled a live ball, instant replay showed Florida Marlins right fielder Bryan Petersen was interfered with by multiple fans during his opportunity to catch a ball, under Rule 2.00 INTERFERENCE (d)(1) and (2). After instant replay review, first base umpire and crew chief Joe West ruled Pence out under the provisions of spectator interference, Rule 3.16, and sent Phillies baserunner Ryan Howard back to first base. For the second time in less than a month, a manager was ejected arguing the instant replay decision: Charlie Manuel was ejected and elected to play the game under protest. On September 7, 2011, MLB VP of Baseball Operations Joe Torre denied the first ever protest associated with authorized instant replay usage.\nChanges for 2014.\nInstant replay was not expanded in 2012, and Torre confirmed that instant replay would again not be expanded in time for Opening Day 2013, putting off plans for another season. On August 15, 2013, Major League Baseball announced that it would expand its video review process for the 2014 season, granting managers one challenge over the first six innings of games and two from the seventh inning until the end of the game. Calls that are challenged would be reviewed by a crew in MLB headquarters in New York City, who make the final ruling.\nAs part of the 2014 collective bargaining agreement between MLB's owners and players union (MLBPA), and approval by the umpires union (WUA), two additional elements were added to the replay rules. Instant replay was expanded to include fair and foul calls and balls that are caught or trapped by the player catching the ball. It also expanded interference reviews beyond the home run boundary to all walls.\n2013 Arizona Fall League testing.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2013 World Series, MLB announced it would test expanded instant replay as proposed for 2014 for a week's slate of games in the Arizona Fall League. During the second inning of the Tuesday, November 5 Solar Sox-Rafters game played at Talking Stick Resort Arena, first base umpire Sean Barber ruled batter C. J. Cron out at first base on a close play. Manager Bill Richardson approached plate umpire Hal Gibson to challenge the play, initiating the first video review conducted by off-field umpires and relayed via headset to the plate umpire; Barber's out call was upheld after the review. In total, four plays were reviewed during the debut game, with instant replay affirming the umpire's on-field call all four times.\nThe first overturned call occurred during November 6's Rafters-Scorpions game when umpires used replay to reverse an out call on a stolen base attempt. The game also featured a rare multi-replay challenge, as video review upheld two umpiring calls in one play: batter Kyle Kubitza's touch of second base as well as his slide into third base ahead of a tag.\nIn total, fifteen calls were challenged with three overturned upon instant replay review, resulting in a 20% overturn rate.\nExpanded replay approved for 2014.\nTo accommodate the anticipated expansion of instant replay, MLB promoted seven minor league umpires to the full-time major league staff on January 14, 2014. Two days later, on January 16, MLB officially announced the approval of expanded instant replay for use during the 2014 season, whose terms were modified after negotiations with the MLBPA and WUA. According to the terms, managers were allotted one challenge per game (two if the first challenge resulted in an overturned call) while the umpiring crew chief was empowered to initiate a review in the seventh inning and beyond. The umpires were also allowed to review a home run call at any time. Once a call was challenged or an umpire requested a video review, fellow umpires in New York's Replay Command Center watched video of the play in question using the \"indisputable video evidence\" standard when deciding whether to overturn a call. The following plays were reviewable under the system:\nJudgment calls not specified above, including, but not limited to, pitches called ball or strike, obstruction, interference, the infield fly rule, and checked swings are not reviewable.\nOn March 31, 2014, the first instant replay challenge under the new system occurred when Chicago Cubs manager Rick Renteria challenged a potential double play in the top of the fifth inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates, disputing the call on the field that pitcher Jeff Samardzija was out at first. The umpires confirmed the call on the field, and the Cubs lost the challenge. From announcement of the challenge to confirmation of the call, the process took 1 minute, 40 seconds, longer than MLB's hope of 60 to 90 seconds per review. Later that day, the first successful challenge took place when Atlanta Braves manager Fredi González challenged the call of a Ryan Braun single. It was overturned to an out in a review that took 58 seconds, although the Braves lost the game to the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0; coincidentally, former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig was in attendance for the first successful challenge. Moments later, the aforementioned Cubs–Pirates game had the second overturned call (and the first in extra innings) when Emilio Bonifacio was called safe on a pickoff attempt by Bryan Morris. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle successfully challenged the call, which was said to have influenced the outcome of the game, a 1-0 Pirates victory. Finally, the first umpire-initiated review took place in a game between the Oakland Athletics and Cleveland Indians when umpire Mike Winters wanted to confirm that Oakland catcher John Jaso did not unnecessarily block the plate as Michael Brantley attempted to score.\nAs of the 2014 All-Star Break, instant replay was generally well received by managers, players, and umpires. Managers challenged 606 calls, or an average of one every 2.35 games, of which 52% were overturned. Including situations where umpires requested the Replay Operations Center to review a call, 47.7% of calls were overturned. However, MLB informally allows up to 30 seconds to have the team's video coordinator signal a call to the manager. When situations where the manager comes out on the field to await a decision from a team video coordinator are included, MLB estimates the percentage of calls overturned decreases to 21%. The average replay review takes one minute, fifty seconds, which is higher than MLB's original goal of 90 seconds per review.\nOne side effect has been the addition of 12 new umpires—the most since 1999—to MLB's staff, due to the need to staff the Replay Command Center with two crews. However, statistics show that umpiring quality has remained constant despite the additions, with four out of the top seven umpires with reversals those who have umpired more than 1,600 games.\nChanges for 2015.\nIn 2015, many changes regarding instant replay were made. Managers could invoke instant replay from the dugout and were no longer be required to approach the calling umpire to challenge a call. Managers could hold play from the top step of the dugout by signaling to players and the home plate umpire that they are considering a challenge. A decision could be communicated verbally or with a hand signal. To challenge an inning-ending call, managers are required to leave the dugout immediately in order to hold the defensive team on the field.\nTag-up plays became reviewable, to help determine if a player touched the base before continuing or not. A manager now retains his challenge after every call that is overturned, as opposed to the 2014 standard that allowed a challenge to be retained only after the first overturned call. A manager must use a challenge in order to review whether a play at home plate included a violation of the rule governing home plate collisions. However, in the event that a manager is out of challenges after the start of the seventh inning, the crew chief may still choose to review whether there was a violation of the rule. During postseason games, regular season tiebreaker games, and the All-Star Game, managers are given two challenges per game. Instant replay was not utilized during 2015 spring training, but it was in place for exhibition games at Major League ballparks prior to the start of the 2015 regular season."

        "title": "Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle",
        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1960 Olympic Games took place between August 26 and 27. There were 51 competitors from 34 nations. Nations were limited to two swimmers each, down from three in previous Games. The event was won by John Devitt of Australia over Lance Larson of the United States in a controversial, disputed finish that resulted in a push for electronic timing. It was Australia's second consecutive victory in the event, third-most all-time behind the United States' 7 gold medals and Hungary's 3. Devitt, silver medalist four years earlier, was the fifth man to win multiple medals in the event. Manuel dos Santos earned Brazil's first medal in the men's 100 metre freestyle with his bronze.\nControversy.\nResults were decided by finish judges who relied on their eyes and did not use replays. Three judges were assigned to each finishing position. There were three official timers in 1960 for each lane and swimmer, all timing by hand. All three timers for Devitt, in lane three, timed him in 55.2 seconds. The three timers for lane four timed Lance Larson in 55.0, 55.1, and 55.1 seconds.\nFormer Olympic swimmer and FINA co-founder Max Ritter inspected the judge's scorecards. Two of the three first-place judges found that Devitt had finished first and the third found for Larson. Of the three-second-place judges, two found that Devitt finished second and one found that Larson was second. Ritter pointed out to chief judge Henry Runströmer of Sweden that the scorecards indicated a tie. Runstrümer cast the deciding vote and declared Devitt the winner. However, the rules at that time did not provide for the chief judge to have a vote or give him the right to break ties. Ties were supposed to be broken by referring to the timing machine. The official results placed Devitt first and Larson second, both with the identical time of 55.2 seconds. The United States team appealed, bolstered by videotaped footage of the finish that appeared to show Larson the winner. The appeal jury, headed by Jan de Vries, also the President of FINA in 1960, rejected the appeal, keeping Devitt the winner. This controversy would pave the way for electronic touchpads to be included in swimming events to determine finish and accurate timing.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the eight finalists from the 1956 Games returned: gold medalist Jon Henricks and silver medalist John Devitt, both of Australia. The reduction in the limit of swimmers per nation from three to two made an Australian sweep repeat impossible.\nJeff Farrell was the favorite coming into the year, but an emergency appendectomy a week before the U.S. trials resulted in him finishing fourth and not making the team for the individual event (though he did get a place on the relay team). The two Australian veterans would have been strong competition for him, with Devitt (the world record holder) having a slight edge over Henricks since the last Olympics; however, with Farrell out and Henricks falling ill in Rome (still competing but clearly not at full strength), Devitt became the strong favorite. American swimmers were always dangerous, with Lance Larson and Bruce Hunter the United States pair this Games.\nMalaya (later Malaysia), Malta, and Turkey each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 13th appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 7 heats of between 6 and 8 swimmers each. The top 24 swimmers advanced to the semifinals. There were 3 semifinals of 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of two lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1960 Summer Olympics.\nJohn Devitt and Lance Larson both had official times of 55.2 in the final, breaking the Olympic record.\nResults.\nHeats.\nSeven heats were held; the swimmers with the fastest 24 times advanced to the semifinals. This round took place on August 26.\nSemifinals.\nThree semifinal races were held; the fastest eight swimmers advanced to the final. The semifinals were held on August 26.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on August 27."

        "text": "Oscar \"Heavy\" Johnson (1895–1960) was a baseball player in the Negro leagues. He played catcher and outfielder. Johnson was one of the Negro league's foremost power hitters in the 1920s, reportedly weighing 250 pounds, and known for hitting home runs. Longtime MLB umpire Jocko Conlan once said that Johnson \"could hit a ball out of any park.\"\nJohnson was part of the all-black 25th Infantry Wreckers, a teammate of other future Negro leaguers including Bullet Rogan, Lemuel Hawkins, and Dobie Moore. He briefly played for the St. Louis Giants in 1920 while on Army furlough, hitting .300 in three games, but did not join the Negro leagues until his discharge in 1922. In his rookie season with the Kansas City Monarchs, Johnson batted .406, and posted a .345 average in the Cuban winter league. Johnson won a retroactive triple crown in 1923 with a .406 batting average, 20 home runs and 120 RBI in 98 games. He was the first player in Negro league history (1920-1948) to win two league batting titles (having led the Negro National League in 1922 and 1923 with a .406 batting average). Just eight more players would win at least two batting titles over the next two decades, and four of them matched Johnson in winning consecutive batting titles (of the nine, only Johnson and Artie Wilson are not currently inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame).\nJohnson was also the first member of the Monarchs to hit a home run at the new Kansas City Municipal Stadium. Johnson was credited with more than 60 home runs against all opposition in 1924, and batted .296 in the 1924 Colored World Series, which was won by the Monarchs. Johnson then moved to the Baltimore Black Sox, where he posted averages of .345 and .337 in his 2 seasons with the club. In 1927, with the Harrisburg Giants, Johnson hit .316, teaming with John Beckwith and Oscar Charleston. Johnson split the 1928 season between the Cleveland Tigers and the Memphis Red Sox, posting a .315 average overall.\nFormer pitcher Bill \"Plunk\" Drake said that Johnson was once sleeping on the bench when he was awoken and told to pinch-hit; he grabbed a fungo bat and hit a home run. Despite Johnson's weight, he was described as a \"remarkably fast runner for his bulk.\" He was also described as temperamental and moody, one of the \"nasty boys\". Johnson finished his career in 1933 with a .337 lifetime batting average.\nIn 2012, he was inducted into the Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame along with several other Negro League players.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

        "title": "Baseball doughnut",
        "text": "A baseball doughnut is a weighted ring that fits over the end of a baseball bat, used for warming up during a baseball game. A doughnut is thought to help increase bat speed. Doughnuts can weigh as little as 4 oz. and as much as 28 oz. Players feel baseball doughnuts increase bat velocity because after warming up with a baseball doughnut then decreasing the weight after taking the doughnut off, the swing feels faster. The heavier load of the weighted bat stimulates the neural system and increases muscle activation during lighter bat swings. Researchers have found that muscle contractions are stronger after reaching near maximal loads. One research study also found that additional weight added to the bat may strengthen the muscles of the forearms and wrists. Baseball doughnuts are based on the theory of complex training, which alternates the use of heavier and lighter weights to increase explosive power. By increasing the number of motor units recruited, this training increases muscle performance.\nHistory.\nThe doughnut was created by former New York Yankees catcher Elston Howard. Howard, in 1955, was the first African-American player on the Yankees' roster. He played catcher and the outfield during his time with the Yankees. The first team to invest in Howard's product was the St. Louis Cardinals. This essentially got players out of the habit of swinging multiple bats to warm up. While Howard is credited with inventing the doughnut, he did not make the amount of money he had hoped due to other companies making their own versions of the batting doughnut. Howard and his supporters did not have the funds to take the companies to court. During a game a doughnut usually is in the on-deck circle. The player in the on-deck circle normally swings a bat and stretches to prepare for their at-bat. The different doughnuts weigh varying amounts. The doughnut is discarded in the on-deck circle when the player moves into the batter's box. The weight was later dubbed the \"\"doughnut\" and the \"iron doughnut\"\".\nEfficacy.\nIn 2011 \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported a study from the University of Hawaii that showed using a bat doughnut actually decreased a batter's speed at the plate after warming up with a baseball doughnut. Researchers claim the use of a baseball doughnut can change the muscles recruited and therefore creates inefficient hitting mechanics. A study conducted by California State University, Fullerton found that recreational baseball players warming up with a light and normal weight bat produced faster bat velocity compared to weighted bat warm-ups. Most research studies have found that the weighted bat doughnut has a positive mental effect yet negative physical effect. The \"kinesthetic illusion\" created by the bat doughnut makes players believe they are swinging the standard bat post warm-up with the bat doughnut when the subsequent swings are in fact, slower. This effect influences batters hitting mechanics and timing of swing. \nThe length of time between warming up with a baseball doughnut and swinging at a pitch also seems to have an effect. Researchers in Japan found that post warm-up with a weighted bat doughnut, the first swing had the slowest bat velocity. This may affect a player's decision of which pitch to swing at while at bat. Although baseball doughnuts are widely used among Major League Baseball players as well as high school and college players, the beneficial or detrimental short-term effects are inconclusive in research. However, long-term use of batting doughnuts increases upper body strength therefore increasing bat velocity.\nFor safety reasons, some leagues have begun to prohibit the use of baseball doughnuts. In 2012 Little League revised their Senior League rules to prohibit the use of \"traditional batting donuts\"."

They play their home games at Blundstone Arena, Hobart. They compete in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL), the premier 50-over women's cricket tournament in Australia. They previously played in the now-defunct Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup and Australian Women's Cricket Championships.\nHistory.\n1906–1984: Early history.\nTasmania's first recorded match was against Victoria on 17 March 1906. A second match against Victoria was also recorded on 23 March 1906. Their next recorded match did not take place until 27 December 1979, when they played Victoria Women's Cricket Association President's XI.\n1985–1991: Australian Women's Cricket Championships.\nTasmania joined the Australian Women's Cricket Championships for the 1985–86 season. Their first match was a loss to South Australia by an innings and 124 runs. Tasmania failed to win a match and finished bottom of the table. Tasmania made further appearances in the Australian Women's Cricket Championships in 1987–88 and 1990–91, finishing bottom both times. They also appeared in the Women's Australian Under-21 Championships in 1985/86 and 1986/87.\n2009–present: Twenty20 Cup and Women's National Cricket League.\nTasmania joined the Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup as Tasmanian Roar for the 2009–10 season, finishing bottom of the table. They joined the WNCL for the 2010–11 season, but again finished bottom. Tasmania's best finish in the Twenty20 Cup came in its final season, 2014–15, when they finished fourth. They finished third in the WNCL in 2018–19 and 2020–21. They won their first WNCL title in 2021–22, topping the group stage before beating South Australia in the final by 9 wickets. They defended their title in 2022–23, again beating South Australia in the final.\nOn 4 June 2018, Cricket Tasmania announced that the name of the team would change to the Tasmanian Tigers, aligning their branding with the men's team.\nGrounds.\nTasmania's first recorded home match against Victoria Women's Cricket Association President's XI was played at the North West Tasmania Cricket Association Ground in Burnie. Since 2008, when they started to play regular matches, Tasmania have predominantly used Blundstone Arena (formerly Bellerive Oval) in Hobart. They have also used other grounds in Hobart such as Lindisfarne Oval, New Town Oval, the TCA Ground, Kingston Beach Oval and Kingston Twin Ovals. Outside Hobart, they have also played occasional matches at NTCA Ground and York Park, both in Launceston.\nBoth of Tasmania's home matches in the 2019–20 WNCL were played at the TCA Ground. They played three 2020–21 WNCL home games at Blundstone Arena and two at Kingston Twin Ovals, whilst in 2021–22 and 2022–23 they only used Blundstone Arena for their home matches.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nBased on squad announced for the 2023/24 season.

        "title": "Whiz Kids (baseball)",
        "text": "The Whiz Kids is the nickname of the 1950 Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball. The team had a number of young players: the average age of a member of the Whiz Kids was 26.4. The team won the 1950 National League pennant but failed to win the World Series.\nAfter owner R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr. built a team of bonus babies, the 1950 team won for the majority of the season, but slumped late, allowing the defending National League champion Brooklyn Dodgers to gain ground in the last two weeks. The final series of the season was against Brooklyn, and the final game pitted the Opening Day starting pitchers, right-handers Robin Roberts and Don Newcombe, against one another. The Phillies defeated the Dodgers in extra innings in the final game of the season on a three-run home run by Dick Sisler in the top of the tenth inning. In the World Series which followed, the Whiz Kids were swept by the New York Yankees, who won their second of five consecutive World Series championships.\nThe failure of the Whiz Kids to win another pennant after their lone successful season has been attributed to multiple theories, the most prominent of which is Carpenter's unwillingness to integrate his team after winning a pennant with an all-white team.\nBefore 1950.\nPrior to 1950, the Philadelphia Phillies had made just one appearance in the World Series, which occurred in . In that series, they were defeated by the Boston Red Sox in five games. From 1933 to 1948, the Phillies posted sixteen consecutive losing seasons, a record for the 20th century and a major league record that stood until 2009 (broken by the Pittsburgh Pirates).\nBen Chapman, who managed the Phillies from 1945 to 1948, bemoaned the loss of general manager Herb Pennock, who died during Chapman's final season. Bob Carpenter, the new owner of the team, replaced Chapman after his comments to media sources that Pennock needed to be replaced with \"another strong baseball man\". The new manager, Eddie Sawyer, arrived in the 1948 season and led the Phillies to a winning record in 1949 (81–73). Carpenter's team-building approach was built on provision of ample bonuses for players. Signing bonuses for the players on the 1950 squad ranged from $3,000 ($ in present-day dollars) to $65,000 ($ present-day).\nThe Dodgers, meanwhile, had appeared in the and 1949 World Series, losing to the New York Yankees in both. Indeed, the Phillies' appearance against the Yankees in the 1950 World Series was the only time in the Yankees' run of five consecutive championships (1949–1953) wherein they did not face one of the other teams from New York City (the Dodgers or the New York Giants).\nThe 1950 season.\nApril–May.\nThe Phillies opened the season with a 9–1 defeat of the Dodgers on April 18. The starters in the game were Robin Roberts for Philadelphia and Don Newcombe, Brooklyn's 17-game winner from the prior season. After a split with the Dodgers, the Phillies played four games against the Boston Braves, losing two, tying one, and winning one; reliever Jim Konstanty earned his first win in the final game of the series. Three games in New York against the Giants and the Dodgers did not improve the team's record, but they took three of the next four from Boston. In May, the team amassed its longest winning streak of the season, when they won six consecutive games—one against the St. Louis Cardinals, a three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Redlegs, one against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and the last against the Giants. Konstanty earned another win against New York as the Phillies took two wins from the three-game set, and the end of the Phillies' May was strong with a five-game winning streak against Pittsburgh and the Giants. Two doubleheaders against New York and Brooklyn resulted in three losses to finish the month.\nJune–July.\nIn the middle months of the season, the Whiz Kids played strongly, notching winning records of 14–11 in June and 21–13 in July. Early in July, the Phillies put together a four-game winning streak against the two National League teams from New York, sweeping the Giants in a two-game set and taking two of three from Brooklyn. The 1950 All-Star Game was played on July 11, with four Phillies selected to the roster. Willie Jones started at third base and led off the game, while Roberts was selected as the starting pitcher. Konstanty and Dick Sisler were named to the team as reserves out of the bullpen and in the outfield, respectively. The Phillies played twelve doubleheaders in June and July, including three sets on consecutive game days (July 16 and 18 against the Chicago Cubs and July 19 against Pittsburgh).\nAugust–September: Pennant race.\nAugust was the Whiz Kids' strongest month, with a 20–8 record and a .714 winning percentage. During August and September, the Phillies put together two five-game winning streaks and a four-game winning streak as well. By September 20, the Phillies had a -game lead over Boston and a nine-game lead on Brooklyn. However, injuries began to mount, and with injuries came losses—of players and of games. Among the casualties were pitcher Bob Miller, who injured his back slipping on wet stairs; outfielder Bill Nicholson, diagnosed with diabetes, was out for the remainder of the season. In the last week of the season, with their lead over the Dodgers at four games, the Phillies dropped back-to-back doubleheaders to the Giants, and lost the next game to Brooklyn to fall into their longest losing slump of the season and set up the final game of the season at Ebbets Field. Another loss to the Dodgers would force a best-of-three playoff for the National League pennant.\nFinal game against Brooklyn.\nNo one in the Phillies clubhouse knew who would pitch the final game of the season against the Brooklyn Dodgers, except Sawyer, until an hour before the game, when the manager handed Roberts the ball. Opposing Roberts was Newcombe, who had opened the season against the Phillies in their 9–1 victory. Roberts walked a batter in the bottom of the first inning, but no other runners reached base for Brooklyn until the fourth inning. The Phillies had four baserunners on three singles and a walk against Newcombe, but no one advanced beyond first base. In the bottom of the fourth, Pee Wee Reese hit a double for the Dodgers, but Roberts retired the next three batters in order. In the sixth inning, Sisler was on base, having hit a single through the gap into right field between first baseman Gil Hodges and second baseman Jackie Robinson. Jones singled to left field, driving him in for the first run of the game; his hit has been called \"the most important in Phillies history to that point\". The Dodgers tied the game on a home run by Reese in the bottom of the sixth; the ball landed on a ledge in right-center field and, caught by a wire screen along the foul line, stayed in play but out of Del Ennis' reach.\nThe Phillies got men on base in the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings, while Roberts allowed a single to Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella in the eighth, but the score remained tied, 1–1. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Roberts walked Cal Abrams, who advanced to second on a single by Reese and came around to home plate on Duke Snider's hard single up the middle. Richie Ashburn threw the ball to catcher Stan Lopata, who had replaced starting catcher Andy Seminick on defense in the bottom of the 9th inning from his position in center field, and Lopata tagged Abrams out at the plate. With runners now on second and third, Roberts walked Robinson intentionally to load the bases, then induced Carl Furillo to foul out to Eddie Waitkus. After Roberts retired the last batter, the game went to extra innings. Newcombe allowed hits to Roberts and Waitkus, who advanced to second and third when Ashburn sacrificed himself. Sisler came to the plate and hit a high outside fastball from Newcombe over the left-field wall, dancing to first base as he watched it fly out. Comfortable on the mound again with a 4–1 lead, Roberts retired the side in the tenth inning to secure the complete-game victory and the Phillies' second pennant in franchise history.\nWorld Series.\nSawyer turned heads around the league by naming Konstanty, his closer, the starter for Game 1; he had few options without Robin Roberts, who had started four games in eight days, rookie Bubba Church, who had been hit in the eye with a line drive, and Curt Simmons, who was activated into military service on September 10. Konstanty lost the game, though he allowed only one run on five hits in eight innings pitched; Yankees starter Vic Raschi pitched a complete-game shutout, striking out five. \nRoberts returned to the mound to face Allie Reynolds in the second game, but one run scored could not win the game for the Phillies, as Joe DiMaggio hit a home run to lead off the top of the tenth inning to put the Yankees ahead in the game 2–1, and in the series 2–0. With Ken Heintzelman on the mound in Game 3, the Phillies outhit the Yankees, but could not push enough runs across the plate. The Whiz Kids lost, 3–2. Miller was the Phillies' last hope for a victory, but the ailing rookie was no match for 21-year-old Whitey Ford, as the Phillies lost the last game, 5–2, and became the first team swept in the World Series since the 1939 Cincinnati Reds.\nRecords and legacy.\nKonstanty became the second Phillie to win the Most Valuable Player Award, after Chuck Klein (1932); his 22 saves and 16 wins by a reliever were both National League records at the time. Ennis led the team in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in, while Roberts' 20 wins in 1950 were the beginning of six consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins for the pitcher. \nAs the catcher, Seminick provided veteran leadership for the team and helped guide the young pitching staff. Roberts said of Seminick, \"If you had to pick a guy in the clubhouse who was our leader that year, it would be Andy. He always played hard, and that was his best year by far.\" Six players have since been elected members of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame: outfielder Ashburn; pitchers Roberts, Konstanty, Simmons; and infielders Hamner and Jones. National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum inductees from the Whiz Kids include Roberts, who entered the Hall in 1976, and Ashburn, elected in 1995. \nThe \"Whiz Kids\" name endured for the Phillies franchise into the 1980s, when the 1983 Philadelphia Phillies, a team of veteran players who faced the Baltimore Orioles in the 1983 World Series, were coined the \"Wheeze Kids\".\nAftermath and integration.\nMany thought that the Whiz Kids, with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for years to come. However, it was not to be, as the team finished with a 73–81 record in 1951, and (except for 2nd-place tie in 1964) did not finish higher than third place again until 1975. Different players on the Phillies attributed the team's decline to multiple factors. Roberts believed that the Phillies were \"good, but never quite as good as the teams that beat us\". Ashburn, however, had a different opinion:\n\"We were the last to get any black ball players. We were still pretty good, but they were just getting better.\"\nThe Phillies, as the last team in the National League to integrate, exhibited racist behavior on several occasions. When Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line in 1947, Chapman instructed his players to spike Robinson and pitch at his head. These activities and attitudes continued through the Whiz Kids era and beyond. Carpenter tended to pass by African-American players; his Whiz Kids had won the pennant while fielding an all-white team, and he, as other owners, tended to pass over any non-white players who did not have superstar-level talent. The Phillies did not integrate until 1957, a decade after Robinson's entry, \nwhen John Kennedy made his major league debut on April 22, 1957 at Roosevelt Stadium). Kennedy had two career at bats, and the Phillies did not have an African-American regular until 1962 with Ted Savage and Wes Covington. The 1961 regular lineup did include four persons of color with three players from Cuba and one from Mexico, while Covington was a reserve. However, the first African-American star for the Phillies came in 1964 with Dick Allen.\nCurt Simmons was the last surviving Whiz Kid, passing away on December 13, 2022.\nRoster.\n  *   – Starters, not including pitchers"

It was held on 22 and 24 October at the Auditorio Nacional. There were 117 competitors from 28 nations. Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. The event was won by Sawao Kato of Japan, the nation's second consecutive victory in the event. Kato's teammate Akinori Nakayama took bronze. Mikhail Voronin of the Soviet Union took silver. It was the fifth consecutive Games with a Soviet gymnast on the podium in the men's all-around and the fourth consecutive Games with a Japanese gymnast there; no gymnast from any other nation medaled in the men's all-around from 1956 to 1976. In 1960 and 1964, the two nations had taken 8 of the top 10 places both Games, with Yugoslavia's Miroslav Cerar and Italy's Franco Menichelli the only two breaking up the Japanese–Soviet dominance; this time, Menichelli did not finish all exercises and Cerar was the only person from outside the Soviet Union or Japan in the top 10 as those two nations took 9 of the top 10 places in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFour of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1964 Games returned: gold medalist Yukio Endo of Japan, silver medalist Viktor Lisitsky of the Soviet Union, fifth-place finisher Franco Menichelli of Italy, and seventh-place finisher Miroslav Cerar of Yugoslavia. Endo, Cerar, and Menichelli had all been in the top 10 in 1960 as well. Soviet gymnast Mikhail Voronin was the reigning (1966) World Champion, with Japan's Shuji Tsurumi and Akinori Nakayama finishing second and third.\nEcuador made its debut in the event. East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. France and Italy both made their 13th appearance, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nAll entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus.

        "text": "The 1954 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 21st playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 13, 1954, at Cleveland Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, the home of the Cleveland Indians of the American League.\nSummary.\nThe American League rallied in the bottom of the eighth inning, to defeat the National League in an 11–9 slugfest at Cleveland Stadium. Both teams combined for an All-Star Game record 20 runs, on 31 hits, which included six home runs. Al Rosen led the American League offense, going 3-for-4 with two home runs and five runs batted in.\nStarters Whitey Ford (AL) and Robin Roberts (NL) matched zeroes until the third inning, when the American League hitters stacked themselves to an early 4–0 lead in the bottom of the inning. Minnie Miñoso opened the frame with a single and Nellie Fox walked, while Roberts struck out Mickey Mantle and retired Yogi Berra on a grounder, but could not overcome a three-run homer by Rosen to make it a 3–0 game. Ray Boone followed with a homer before Roberts retired Hank Bauer.\nOpening the fourth inning, the National League rallied for five runs to take a 5–4 lead. Sandy Consuegra retired the first batter he faced, but Duke Snider, Ted Kluszewski and Ray Jablonski hit consecutive singles and Jackie Robinson a double, tying the game at four. Bob Lemon relieved Consuegra, but gave up a two-out, RBI-double by the pinch-hitter Don Mueller before retiring Granny Hamner for the third out.\nMeanwhile, Chico Carrasquel kept the American League attack alive with a lead-off single in the bottom of the fourth against Johnny Antonelli. Carrasquel moved to third on a one-out single by Miñoso and scored on a sacrifice fly by Beto Ávila, tying the score at five.\nThe National League picked up two more two-out runs off Bob Porterfield in the fifth to pull back in front, 7–5, after a single by Snider and a two-run homer by Kluszewski. In the bottom of the inning, Berra hit a single off Antonelli and Rosen belted his second home run of the game to tie the score at seven.\nThe American League regained the lead in the sixth, 8–7, with an RBI-single by Avila off Warren Spahn that brought home Williams.\nIn the eighth inning, the National League bats stayed hot against Bob Keegan. Willie Mays singled and Gus Bell unloaded it with a pinch-hit, two-run homer to put again away the game, 9–8. Dean Stone came in relief with two outs and Red Schoendienst running on third. Schoendienst attempted to steal home and was thrown out by Stone. This third out set the stage for Larry Doby, who pinch hit for Stone with one out in the bottom of the inning and tied the game with a home run against Gene Conley, becoming the first black player to hit a home run in an All-Star Game. After that, Mantle and Berra singled and Rosen walked to load the bases. Carl Erskine replaced Conley and retired Mickey Vernon for the second out, but gave up a two-RBI single to Fox that sealed the 11–9 victory for the American League.\nThe American League (7) and the National League (6) used 13 pitchers in the game. Stone took the win (without retiring a batter) and Conley was tagged with the loss while Virgil Trucks earned the save. Trucks walked Snider to open the ninth inning, but retired Stan Musial, Gil Hodges and Randy Jackson for the last three outs of the game.\nThe win broke a four-game All-Star losing streak for the American League. After this game, the AL led the all-time All-Star Series 13–8.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n&lt;br&gt;\nLine Score.\n\"Play-by-play at Retrosheet\""

        "title": "Double (volleyball)",
        "text": "A double occurs in volleyball when a player, during a match, is credited with scoring at least ten times in one (or more) of five statistical categories: aces, kills, blocks, digs, and assists. The term was apparently derived from similar basketball jargon; the expression \"triple-double\" was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers public relations director Bruce Jolesch in order to showcase Magic Johnson's versatility.\nThere are four main types of doubles:\nOf the five statistical categories, double digit match totals are most common for assists, but rare for any positions other than setter. The next most frequent double-digit category is digs, which is most often attained by liberos or defensive specialists, but can be achieved by any strong defensive player. Kills are the third most common double-digit achievement category, occurring predominantly among hitters, especially outside hitters and middle blockers. Likewise, double-digit blocking numbers are preponderantly accomplished by middle blockers or outside hitters, but are much less common than double-digit kills. Rarest by far are double-digit aces, which even the most exceptional server is unlikely to attain once in a career.\nDouble-double.\nDouble-double is defined as an individual performance in which a player accumulates a double digit number total in two of five statistical categories, including aces, kills, blocks, digs, and assists, during one match. The most common double-double combination is digs and assists, frequently accomplished by setters, although sometimes achieved by liberos and defensive specialists. The next most frequent double-double is kills and digs, usually achieved by hitters (outside hitters or middle blockers) who are versatile defensively. Hitters (outside hitters, middle blockers, or opposite hitters) also sometimes accomplish a double-double of kills and blocks.\nA double-double is regarded as an indication of superior all-around individual performance. Double-doubles are fairly common, and in some matches more than one player manages to record one, most likely when a match exceeds three sets, particularly five-set matches.\nTriple-double.\nTriple double is defined as an individual performance in which a player accumulates a double digit number total during one match in three of five statistical categories, aces, kills, blocks, digs, and assists. The most common way for a player to achieve a triple-double is with kills, blocks, and digs, usually attained by hitters (i.e., middle blockers, outside hitters, or opposite hitters) who are skilled defensively. Occasionally, setters record a triple-double, typically combining assists, digs, and either kills or blocks.\nA triple-double is a rare event, and indicates outstanding all-around individual performance.\nQuadruple-double.\nQuadruple-double is defined as an individual performance in which a player accumulates a double digit number total in four of the five major statistical categories--aces, kills, blocks, digs, and assists--during the course of one match. Because of specialization by position (setters, liberos, middle blockers, outside hitters, opposite hitters, defensive specialists, etc.), quadruple doubles are seldom seen at collegiate or professional levels.\nQuintuple-double.\nQuintuple-double is defined as an individual performance in which a player accumulates a double digit number total in all five statistical categories (aces, kills, blocks, digs, and assists) in a single match. Such a feat has never occurred at the collegiate or the professional level.\nNotes.\nLike basketball, the recognition of double statistics in volleyball is a recent historical phenomenon.\nParity is not a characteristic of the statistical categories. The ace is undoubtedly most valuable, since it single-handedly earns a point for the team. The kill could be viewed as the next most valuable, because it consummates the winning of a point. Blocks have differing values, although the stuff block is comparable in value to the kill. The value of a dig also varies, depending primarily upon how effectively the ball is passed to a setter, but also on how difficult the save was to accomplish. Even more variable is the value of an assist, measured by such criteria as the strength of the received pass, accuracy, height, distance from the net, deceptiveness, and quickness.\nDoubles are most likely to occur in a match that extends to five sets wherein one or more of the sets has extra points (i.e., scores in the first four sets exceeding 25 points, and a winning tally of more than 15 points in the fifth set)."

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Men's vault",
        "text": "The men's vault competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. It was held on 5, 7, and 10 September at the Baths of Caracalla. There were 129 competitors from 28 nations, with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 2 gymnasts. For the second straight Games, there was a tie for first place in the vault. Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union and Takashi Ono of Japan each received a gold medal. It was the third consecutive Games with a gold medal for the Soviets. Ono, who had taken bronze in 1952, became the second man to win multiple vault medals. Third place and the bronze medal went to Soviet Vladimir Portnoi.\nThe 1960 gymnastics competitions introduced apparatus finals, with the all-around competition serving as a qualifying round for the vault final.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the top 10 gymnasts from 1956 returned: bronze medalist Yury Titov of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union, sixth-place finisher (and 1952 silver medalist) Masao Takemoto of Japan, and seventh-place finisher Jack Beckner of the United States. Also returning was Takashi Ono of Japan, bronze medalist in 1952 and 16th place in 1956. The 1958 World Championship podium was (in order) Titov, Takemoto, and Ono.\nMorocco and South Korea each made their debut in the men's vault; the short-lived United Arab Republic made its only appearance. The United States made its ninth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics all-around events continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to two individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. The event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004).\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the new apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 130th. For the apparatus finals, the all-around score for that apparatus was multiplied by one-half then added to the final round exercise score to give a final total.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, with the final total apparatus score from 0 to 20."

        "text": "Cricket in Vietnam was first played in the mid–20th Century; however, it was formalised with the formation of the Hanoi Cricket Club in 1993. Cricket is largely played in Vietnam by English expatriates, who maintain cricket's social facets in a largely football (soccer) playing country, as the Vietnam Sports Industry has no official organisation for cricket. Nevertheless, it remains \"excited by the idea of promoting cricket\" and is advocating the formation of a cricket association, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.\nIn Vietnam, a three-team 30 over Trophy is played annually, and the cricket seasons runs from September to December. From March to May, 40 local cricket clubs also play a season of cricket. The use of rattan matting as a batting wicket meant that run ups in Vietnam are only a few yards long, and this policy was implemented two overs into the first international match between the Hanoi Cricket Club and an England/Australia touring party in 1993. In 2000, a Hanoi player, BT Duong, hit the club's first ever century, the second in the entire nation's history, and the first overseas players began to play. Matches, however, remain oft affected by the weather.\nIn 2006 the Saigon Cricket Association (SCA) was formed with six, mainly nationality based, teams playing in a 25 over, Sunday Tournament at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) sports ground in Ho Chi Minh City. Expat teams from Australia, England, Sri Lanka, 2 x India and a mixed nation side from RMIT all played in the inaugural year, with the Saigon Australian Cricket Club winning the tournament.\nThe SCA was renamed the Vietnam Cricket Association (VCA) in 2009, to commence the formal applications for incorporation and to request membership to the Asian Cricket Council. The VCA organises an international sixes tournament in February and/or March of each year.\nThe Vietnam national cricket team shall debut in the Cricket at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games event."

        "title": "Rugby union in Iceland",
        "text": "Rugby union is a minor sport in Iceland with a discontinuous history.\nHistory.\nThe ancient Norse had a sport called \"knattleikr\"; while this differed substantially from rugby in that it used sticks, it also had a couple of similarities to it in tackling methods and that the ball could be carried.\nAs a purist language, which has almost no modern foreign loanwords, Icelandic has a unique name for rugby, \"Ruðningur\". It is perhaps the only language to use its own name for the sport which is not cognate with \"rugby\".\nIceland was formerly a colony of Denmark, and when Denmark was occupied by Germany during World War II, British forces occupied Iceland itself. However, it is not recorded whether they played in Iceland while stationed there. Rugby itself was first played in Denmark in 1931, and did not reach Iceland – likewise, the Danish Rugby Union was founded after Icelandic independence in 1950.\nIceland became independent in 1944, and the British turned their base over to the USA which took responsibility for the defence of the island during the Cold War. What little rugby appears to have been played in Iceland seems to have been at the American base at Keflavik, by Americans, with little or no local involvement. However, while there is a large American player base, mainly by dint of a large population, rugby is a minor sport in the USA.\nRecent history.\nIn 2009, a group of expats and locals started the project to create the first rugby team in Iceland. They can be found on Facebook at the Rugby félag Íslands (Icelandic Rugby Team) group.\nIn 2010, The Reykjavik Raiders Rugby Club was founded. The team competed in The Copenhagen Sevens in August of this year. This was the first time an Icelandic rugby team had played anywhere. They continue to train and grow and are working hard to eventually establish and develop the game in Iceland with a view to grow the sport domestically and competing internationally.\nSunday 3 July 2011, is a historic event for the development of rugby union in Iceland and a major milestone for the Reykjavík Raiders Rugby Football Club. For both the Raiders, and Iceland this date marks the first 15's game played by the club and the first ever played on Icelandic soil.\nThe game against the Thunderbird Oldboys from Phoenix (Arizona) at the Valur sports complex in Reyjkavik was a great learning step for the Icelandic team that ended with an Icelandic win.\nStarting in January 2012 RKK or the Rugby Club of Kópavogur has been added to the portfolio of clubs operating in Iceland. The first game scheduled between the two Icelandic teams is scheduled to take place in April.\nIn February 2013 the Icelandic Exiles rugby team plays six XV games and participated in the Vegas HSBC Invitational Rugby Tournament.\nThe Icelandic Rugby Team plays its first official rugby 7s tournament Saturday 1 Juni 2013 in Riga at the FIRA-AER Rugby 7s. It has participated in the FIRA-AER Rugby 7s at Ricani near Pragues on Saturday 28 juni 2014.\nThere is no sport union in Iceland for rugby. There needs to be established a minimum of 5 rugby clubs before a union can be formed. Rugby Iceland is the representing body for the sport in the country - They are currently affiliated to FIRA-AER, but not yet to the IRB."

        "title": "Rugby tens",
        "text": "Rugby tens, also known as ten-a-side and Xs, is a variant of rugby union in which teams are made up of ten players, typically five forwards and five backs. Matches are much shorter, usually played as two ten-minute halves.\nUnlike the other two major rugby union variants - sevens and beach rugby - which were invented in major rugby nations, rugby tens was developed in Malaysia, a nation that has never qualified for the Rugby World Cup.\nThe rules (law variations) are similar to rugby sevens and are published on the World Rugby website.\nHistory.\nRugby tens was introduced by the Combined Old Boys Rugby Association (COBRA) of Malaysia in 1967 primarily, to enable Asian players to better compete with against larger-sized players from the traditional rugby playing nations. COBRA organized the first Rugby ten-a-side, tournament, COBRA 10s, that same year. It has grown from a local tournament into a prestigious international tournament, with more than 40 nations have been represented to date. Many players who have participated in the COBRA 10s have gone on to don national colours.\nThe game is fairly popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Republic of Korea and Thailand, and especially in South Africa where it is growing very fast. Other tournaments have been organised in Europe, Africa, Australasia and North America.\nFeatures of the game.\nA rugby tens match has two halves of 10 minutes each, though the tournament organiser may change this rule. The scrum has five players, instead of eight as in rugby XV or three as in rugby sevens.\nUnlike sevens rugby, tens offer players of diverse skills, capabilities and different fitness levels the opportunity to continue to enjoy the game they love so much. The more traditional scrums and lineouts are part of the game whilst the fact that there is a bit more space on the field, however not too much as to expose the slower forwards on the defensive lines, makes this a very popular game for all levels of players.\nTournaments.\nMajor rugby tens tournaments include:\nThe popular Cape Town Tens attracts teams from all over the world to South Africa during the first week of February each year."

It was most popular in Moravia (especially Brno), Prague and Bratislava\nGoverning body.\nCzechoslovakia was a founder member of FIRA in 1934, and joined the IRB in 1988.\nTraditionally, Czech rugby has centred on a \"section of the middle class\" in and around Prague, which has been fairly small but fairly loyal to the sport.\nHistory.\nRugby union was a moderately popular sport in Czechoslovakia\nJosef Rössler-Ořovský, who introduced a number of sports in the then Czechoslovakia, among others skiing and tennis, was originally credited with starting rugby as well back in 1895. He went to England and brought back a rugby ball with him. Efforts were made to play the game at the Czech Yacht Club, but a public struggle ensued, and rugby subsequently never really caught on.\nRugby union was only properly introduced to the country by the writer Ondřej Sekora, when he returned from living in France in 1926, with a rugby ball and set of rules; he also coined Czech language rugby terminology. Brno, the Moravian capital is considered the cradle of rugby in Czechoslovakia, and is where the first match took place, between SK Moravská Slávie and AFK Žižka Brno, with the former winning 31–17. Both of these teams were trained by Sekora.\n1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\nCzechoslovakia was not invited to the first Rugby World Cup in 1987, and did not qualify for the second in 1991.\nRugby union, like many other sports, was long to be connected in the public mind with the less savoury aspects of Communism:\nBreak up of Czechoslovakia.\nThe breakup of Czechoslovakia led to the similar breakup of its sporting bodies, with separate Czech and Slovak teams etc.\nNational team.\nThe SFR Czechoslovakia side was, strictly speaking, a multinational side, consisting as it did of representatives of all the various nations within the SFR Czechoslovakia.\nIts successor teams are the Czech Republic national rugby union team and the Slovakia national rugby union team."

A total of 252 athletes representing 17 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these Games. Overall, 14 events in 7 disciplines were contested.\nThe Olympic program remained similar to previous Winter Olympics, with only a few exceptions. Both men and women competed in these Games. Warm weather forced officials to hold the four-man bobsleigh competition two days after the closing ceremonies, which had been conducted on February 13.\nA total of 87 athletes won medals. Athletes from the United States earned the most medals during the Games, winning 12 medals, half of which were gold. Athletes from Norway and Canada won the second and third most medals, with 10 and 7 respectively. Athletes from 10 participating NOCs won at least one medal; 7 won at least one gold medal.\nSonja Henie of Norway won her second consecutive gold medal in the ladies' individual figure skating competition. Andrée Brunet and Pierre Brunet of France won their third consecutive medal in pairs figure skating, having won bronze in Chamonix before golds in St. Moritz and Lake Placid. In the men's event, Austrian figure skater Karl Schäfer beat out three-time Olympic champion Gillis Grafström of Sweden. American Edward Eagan became the first athlete to win medals at both Summer and Winter Olympics; he had won a gold medal in light heavyweight boxing at the 1920 Summer Olympics and took home a gold in the four-man bobsleigh at Lake Placid. Although other athletes since have earned medals in both Summer and Winter Olympics, Eagan remains the only person to have won gold medals in both.\nBobsleigh.\nA number of athletes may have served as alternates for the various teams in the bobsleigh events, although there is disagreement among sources as to whether they should be considered medal winners. They are listed in the International Olympic Committee's medalist database as having won medals for teams on which they were alternates. However, while they do appear in the Official Report of the 1932 Olympic Games on pages which list members of the teams, their names are not mentioned in the pages that list winners of the events. This list only includes those athletes who were listed in the Official Report as winners of the events.\nStatistics.\nMultiple medalists.\nAthletes who won multiple medals during the 1932 Winter Olympics are listed below."

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1952 Summer Olympics took place between 26 and 27 July at the Helsinki Swimming Stadium. There were 61 competitors from 33 nations. Nations had been limited to three swimmers each since the 1924 Games. The event was won by Clarke Scholes of the United States, the nation's second consecutive and seventh overall victory in the men's 100 metre freestyle (most of any nation). Japan, absent from the 1948 Games after World War II, returned to the podium in the event with Hiroshi Suzuki's silver. Göran Larsson earned Sweden's first medal in the event since 1908 with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the eight finalists from the 1948 Games returned: bronze medalist Géza Kádas of Hungary and fifth-place finisher (and European champion) Alex Jany of France. There was no clear front-runner this year; Dick Cleveland was the closest to a favorite.\nCeylon, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Israel, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Venezuela, and Vietnam each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 11th appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule was new, introducing a major change from the format used from 1912 to 1948. A swimmer's place in the heat was no longer used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 9 heats of 6 or 7 swimmers each. The top 24 swimmers advanced to the semifinals. There were 3 semifinals of 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of two lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1952 Summer Olympics.\nClarke Scholes broke the Olympic record in the first semifinal with 57.1 seconds.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe 24 fastest swimmers from nine heats advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe 8 fastest swimmers advanced to the final.\nBecause there were 3 swimmers with the same swim time, a tie-breaking heat was held. The two fastest swimmers advanced to the final."

It was most popular in the Croatian SR (especially Zagreb), and to a lesser extent in the Serbian and Slovenian SRs (especially Belgrade and Ljubljana), with some presence in the Bosnian SR as well.\nHistory.\n1950s and 1960s.\nSome people date the start of Croatian rugby to the 17th of January 1954 when the Mladost team from Zagreb was formed to become Croatia's first rugby union club.\nIn 1953, the rival code of rugby league was introduced into Serbia, rather than rugby union played in Croatia and the authorities demanded that Serbian clubs switch to rugby union to unite Yugoslavia under one form of rugby football in 1964.\n1970s and 1980s.\nYugoslav rugby did not enjoy high reputation. For example, in 1988, an anonymous French rugby official joked that \"one of the FIRA nightmares... is to have playing refereed by a Soviet.\"\nYugoslavia was not invited to the first Rugby World Cup in 1987, and did not qualify for the second in 1991.\nThe former All Black scrum half Chris Laidlaw, writing at the end of the 1970s, saw rugby as a positive force in east-west relations at the time:\nYugoslavia affiliated to the IRB in 1988, and played in the 1988 World Cup qualification.\nDue to the links between many Yugoslav (mostly Croat) and New Zealand families, the side also toured there.\nBreak up of Yugoslavia.\n1. Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n2. Croatia, \n3. Macedonia, \n4. Montenegro, \n5. Serbia, \n5a. Kosovo, \n5b. Vojvodina,\n6.

Before his death in 1994, he tried hard to establish a Central European\nequivalent of the Six Nations between Austria, Hungary, Croatia, \nSlovenia and Bosnia.\nPopularity.\nRugby union was a moderately popular sport in Yugoslavia (a name which Serbia retained long after the disintegration of that state). Although rugby union in Croatia was the main centre for the sport in the former Yugoslavia, there was still quite a bit of rugby played in Serbia. The Rugby Championship of Yugoslavia ran from 1957-1991. Partizan, a Belgrade team, won the second, third, and fourth title, as well as the final one in 1991 and Dinamo Pančevo won the first ever championship played in 1957, and won again in 1968, 1969, 1974 and 1979. Dinamo Pančevo won their first Cup in the same year.\nNational team.\nThe SFR Yugoslavia side was, strictly speaking, a multinational side, consisting as it did of representatives of all the various nations within the SFR Yugoslavia."

Before this date all New Zealand national sides were made up entirely of residents. In 1993, New Zealand fielded its first ever national team made up entirely of overseas based players. Since 1993, with the exception of a few players from the Auckland/New Zealand Warriors team competing in the Australian National Rugby League, the New Zealand national team is predominantly filled with expat Kiwis.\nIn 1994, then Kiwi coach Frank Endacott led a New Zealand Residents side on a tour of Australia.\nIn 1996 New Zealand XIII participated in the Pacific Challenge and, as the Lion Red Cup XIII, drew in a match against the touring Great Britain side and defeated the touring Papua New Guinea side.\nNew Zealand XIII competed in the 1997 Oceania Cup, defeating New Zealand Māori in the final. In 1998 a Residents XIII lost two matches to the Auckland Warriors.\nNew Zealand 'A', coached by Gary Kemble, toured the United States and France in 2002 and, led by Ged Stokes, Great Britain in 2003. These two touring sides featured many players who would go on to have professional careers, including George Carmont, David Fa'alogo, Fuifui Moimoi, Tevita Latu, Phillip Leuluai and Hutch Maiava.\nSince then team has reverted to being known as the New Zealand Residents, with a New Zealand 'A' taking the field in 2006 made up of overseas based professional players.\nIn 2006 the New Zealand Residents, coached by David Lomax, competed in a Trans Tasman Quadrangular Series against the Queensland Residents, New South Wales Country and a Jim Beam Cup selection. The Residents won this series. The Residents then played the New Zealand national rugby league team in a warm up match for the 2006 Tri-Nations. The senior side won 34-4.\nThe Residents have also competed in the World Sevens.\n2016- NZ RESIDENTS VS MAORI XIII - Game played at Davies Park, Huntly, NZ 15/10/2016\nFINAL SCORE - NZ Residents Win 30-10\n2017- NZ RESIDENTS VS MAORI XIII - Game played at Pullman Park, Auckland, NZ 14/10/2017\nFINAL SCORE - NZ Maori Win 22-16\n2017 selection.\nThe Residents side played a New Zealand Māori XIII on 14 October 2017. The Residents were coached by Rod Ratu assistant coach Andrew Auimatagi, trainer Jason McCarthy and manager Alana Lockhorst and include; Uila Aiolupo, Jethro Friend, Roman Hifo, Paulos Latu, Alan Niulevu, Raymond Talimalie, Taylor bear (Counties Manukau Stingrays), Tevin Arona, Chris Bamford, James Baxendale, Phil Nati, Nathan Saumalu, Matthew Sauni (Canterbury Bulls), Siua Otunuku, Daniel Palavi, Cole Waaka (Air Force &amp; NZDF), Tevita Satae (Akarana Falcons) and Nick Read (Waikato)."

The Chargers played their home games in the Von Braun Center, and were a member of College Hockey America.\nThe 2009–10 season marked the final season for men's hockey as part of College Hockey America; Niagara University and Robert Morris University moved to Atlantic Hockey, and Bemidji State moved to the WCHA for the 2010–11 season. With the CHA folding, UAH applied for admission to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). On August 11, the CCHA announced that UAH's application to become a member of the conference was denied. Following the 2009–10 season, UAH will play as the only Division I Independent program due to the lack of conference affiliation.\nAfter a 30-game regular season, the Chargers finished with 10 wins, 17 losses, and 3 ties. Highlights came from a road upset of then-fifth ranked Notre Dame in the first game of the season, and a consolation win at the Catamount Cup in January.

        "text": "The men's horizontal bar competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. The event was held on 22, 24, and 26 October. There were 115 competitors from 27 nations, with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won in a tie between Akinori Nakayama of Japan (the nation's third victory in the horizontal bar in four Games, tying Switzerland for most all-time) and Mikhail Voronin of the Soviet Union (the nation's second consecutive gold medal in the event, tying the United States for third-most all-time). Eizo Kenmotsu of Japan took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the six finalists from 1964 returned: bronze medalist Miroslav Cerar of Yugoslavia, fourth-place finisher Victor Lisitsky of the Soviet Union, and fifth-place finisher Yukio Endo of Japan. Cerar and Endo had both been finalists in 1960 as well. Japan had swept the medals at the 1966 world championships, with Akinori Nakayama winning, Endo taking second, and Takashi Mitsukuri third. Cerar had tied with Mikhail Voronin of the Soviet Union for fourth.\nEcuador and the Philippines each made their debut in the men's horizontal bar; East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. The United States made its 11th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. (Two gymnasts who entered the all-around competition did not perform on the horizontal bar.)\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the new apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 115th. In the final, each gymnast performed an additional voluntary exercise; half of the score from the preliminary carried over."

        "title": "English cricket team in Bangladesh in 2009–10",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured Bangladesh at the end of the 2009–10 cricket season, playing three One Day Internationals (ODI) and two Test matches. Regular England captain Andrew Strauss controversially missed the tour to rest for the 2010–11 Ashes series, so the team was led for the first time by Alastair Cook. Bangladesh were captained by all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan.\nEngland whitewashed Bangladesh in both the Test and ODI series, maintaining their record as the only Test-playing nation not to have been beaten by the Bangladeshis. England gave debuts to five players during the series, including South African-born Craig Kieswetter, which drew criticism over the number of foreign-born players in the England team, particularly from former England captain Michael Vaughan.\nBackground.\nIn the 12 previous matches between the two sides – four Test matches and eight ODIs – England had a 100% winning record against Bangladesh, the only international team able to boast such a record. The previous year, Bangladesh had claimed their first Test series victory against a senior Test nation, though it came against a West Indies side that was heavily weakened because of an industrial dispute. England came into the tour on the back of a two-and-a-half-month series against South Africa in which they had tied the Test and Twenty20 International series, and secured a 2–1 ODI series win.\nSquads.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced in September 2009 that it \"[had] to prioritise\" and would most likely be sending a weakened squad to tour Bangladesh. The press theorised that possible candidates to be rested included captain Andrew Strauss, Paul Collingwood, Stuart Broad and James Anderson. When the squad was officially announced in January 2010, only Strauss and Anderson were omitted from the touring squad. The reason given for Anderson's break was to give him opportunity to undergo a specialist review and rehabilitation for a chronic injury to his right knee, to enable him to return to full fitness for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. The decision to rest Strauss was rationalised by national selector Geoff Miller as \"the selectors feel it is important that he takes a break ahead of an extremely busy programme of international cricket\". This decision was not universally accepted, with former England captains Ian Botham and Michael Atherton among those who spoke out against the move; Botham claimed: \"As captain you need to be there with your team ... I think it’s a major mistake.\"\nEngland called up three uncapped players, naming bowlers Ajmal Shahzad and James Tredwell in both squads, and opening batsman Michael Carberry in the Test squad. Following a string of impressive performances for the England Lions, South African-born wicket-keeper batsman Craig Kieswetter was added to the ODI squad. Kieswetter had only completed his qualification period for England on the day before his first Lions match, and had previously represented South Africa Under-19s. Former England captain Michael Vaughan was unhappy with the inclusion of Kieswetter in the squad, and said that in an ideal world he would like to see \"11 complete Englishmen in the team,\" and complained that he had \"a problem, that we have almost got a 'ship-in' system of looking at talent\". Injuries to Ryan Sidebottom, Graham Onions and Broad prompted England to call up Steven Finn as cover for the Test series, and Tim Bresnan remained with the squad after originally only being part of the ODI squad.\nIn contrast to the selection issues and injury problems surrounding England, Bangladesh came into the tour with a relatively stable squad. Uncapped players Nasir Hossain and Suhrawadi Shuvo were both named in the ODI squad, and Mashrafe Mortaza was fit to play after making it through the warm-up game against England for the BCB XI, having not played since July 2009 due to a knee injury. After playing in the first ODI, Mortaza withdrew from the squad for the remaining ODIs and Test matches, citing a disagreement over his fitness. The Bangladesh chairman of selectors, Rafiqul Alam, announced that Mortaza had withdrawn himself \"to be by the side of his ailing mother\". Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh's most-capped player, was omitted from the Test squad as he had failed to convince the selectors that he was in the right frame of mind for international cricket. The day after the squad had been announced, Bangladesh's preparations for the opening Test match were \"thrown into disarray\" when Raqibul Hasan announced his retirement from international cricket at the age of 22. It was reported that the retirement was due to Raqibul's displeasure at being omitted from the provisional squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. Uncapped Jahurul Islam was called into the squad to replace him.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nAfter winning the toss, England opted to put Bangladesh into bat, but their new-ball bowlers failed to maintain a good line and length, providing opener Tamim Iqbal with plenty of bad deliveries to put away for boundaries. Their breakthrough came in the 10th over, when Bresnan bowled a slower ball to Imrul Kayes who found a leading edge and was caught by Luke Wright at mid-on. Two more wickets followed closely as Junaid Siddique hit a half-volley softly to the fielder at square leg in the next over, and then Aftab Ahmed was run out in the 13th over, leaving Bangladesh with 82 runs for the loss of three wickets (82/3). Captain Shakib Al Hasan and vice-captain Mushfiqur Rahim both provided Tamim with some support, but both were undone by their own rashness; Shakib advanced down the wicket to Graeme Swann and provided an edge for Matt Prior to catch behind the stumps, while Mushfiqur attempted a run which was never available and presented Kevin Pietersen with his second run out of the match. Tamim alone provided resistance, showing \"imperious strokeplay all around the ground\" and a measure of maturity in his innings. His 125 came off 120 balls, including 13 fours and 3 sixes, eventually being dismissed in the 43rd over, bowled by Broad, with Bangladesh on 214/9. The final two batsmen lasted three overs, adding 14 to score, leaving England requiring 229 to win.\nIn England's reply, captain Alastair Cook played in a fashion reminiscent of the man he had replaced for the tour, Strauss, as he played an accumulatory innings to score 64. Kieswetter, who had been brought into the team to provide firepower at the start of the innings was outscored by Cook 4 to 1, and was nearly dismissed twice in his first over, offering an edge to wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim, and two balls later he was caught in front, but umpire Rod Tucker ruled that he was not out. Kieswetter was dismissed in the 13th over for 19, completely missing a drive to present Mushfiqur with an easy stumping. An over later, Kevin Pietersen fell for just one run, leaving England on 74/2. Cook and new man Collingwood put on 22 runs before the opener was adjudged leg before wicket (LBW) though replays indicated that the ball was missing the stumps on the leg side. Collingwood then anchored the chase with Eoin Morgan, the pair adding 88 runs to the score. After the dismissal of Morgan on 33, it was left to Prior to join Collingwood to add the required runs, and England won with four overs to spare.\n2nd ODI.\nBoth sides made changes going into the second ODI; for England, Sidebottom made way as England opted to hand a debut to Tredwell in order to play two spinners, while Bangladesh called on Shuvo and Rubel Hossain, dropping Siddique and Mortaza. For the second consecutive match, England won the toss and chose to field. The match began in similar fashion to the first ODI, with two quick wickets in the 10th and 11th overs taking Bangladesh from 46/0 to 56/2. However, a third-wicket partnership of 90 between Kayes and Rahim steadied the innings and helped Bangladesh to gain confidence. After Imrul Kayes' dismissal, Rahim increased his scoring-rate with a series of boundaries to take the score past 200, and was dismissed by a slower ball from Bresnan with the score at 211/5. Some late swinging from the tail saw Bangladesh finish on 260/6, their highest total in ODIs against England.\nEngland lost opener Kieswetter in the first over; caught at first slip off the third ball of the innings, having been dropped by the keeper the ball before. Pietersen and Collingwood were both trapped LBW by Abdur Razzak without passing 20, and Morgan joined Cook in the middle with the score at 68/3. Initially, Morgan supported his captain by rotating the strike, but when Cook was dismissed for a 61-ball 60, he played with more freedom. A partnership of 90 with wicket-keeper Prior brought England close to 200, but Wright, Bresnan and Swann all fell cheaply, leaving England requiring 31 runs off 26 balls with only two wickets remaining. With England \"seemingly in disarray\", Morgan took control of the match, and completed the run-chase with three boundaries in five balls. Morgan finished the game with 110 not out, his first century for England.\n3rd ODI.\nThe third ODI saw a change of venue; the teams moving from Dhaka to the coastal town of Chittagong. England again made two bowling changes, seamers Shahzad and Liam Plunkett coming into the team with the injured Broad and spinner Tredwell making way. Bangladesh remained unchanged from the second ODI. The hosts won their first toss of the series, and put England into bat. Kieswetter bucked his natural game and played cautiously: when partner Cook was dismissed for 32 in the 13th over, he had scored 20 off 33 balls. The opener continued to accumulate runs carefully until he reached his half-century in the 33rd over. After passing the milestone, he began to score quicker, cutting and driving as he shared a 74-run partnership with Collingwood. He reached his century with a scampered run off Rubel Hossain, his first in international cricket, in his third ODI appearance. At 22 years and 97 days old, he became the second youngest England batsman to score an ODI century after David Gower. In contrast to the \"all-action\" style that had been expected from him, Kieswetter accrued his century with resolve, saying after the match that: \"In the first two games I wasn't quite aware tactically of how I was going to pace my innings, [in terms of] helping the team win the game. Today I tried to pace myself a bit more, and try to get myself in more before playing big shots.\" His dismissal soon after his century brought Wright to the crease with the freedom to make an aggressive cameo, notching 32 runs off just 13 balls to help England towards a total of 284.\nIn response, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal for a duck in the first over, giving debutant Ajmal Shahzad his first ODI wicket from his third ball of the match. Bresnan removed the other Bangladeshi opener in the 10th over, the first of his four wickets in the match. This wicket brought together Mushfiqur Rahim and Aftab Ahmed, who both played aggressively, putting on 56 together in the next ten overs, but when Aftab Ahmed was run out looking for a non-existent run, Bangladesh started to struggle. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan both fell after making good starts and the required run rate started to rise, making a Bangladeshi victory look improbable. Slow scoring between Naeem Islam and Mahmudullah took victory further away, and Bangladesh eventually finished 45 runs short of their target, granting England a series whitewash.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nThe teams remained in Chittagong for the first Test, in which England gave Test debuts to Finn and Carberry. Bangladesh's preparations for the match were disrupted when middle-order batsman Hasan announced his retirement from international cricket two days earlier, and although Jahurul Islam was called into the squad to replace him, it was Aftab Ahmed who took his place in the team for the Test. Bangladesh won the toss, and made \"among the most unfathomable calls\", putting England into bat on a surface that looked certain to deteriorate. Cook capitalised on the decision, being \"barely troubled\" as he remained 158 not out at the close of the first day, having faced 244 balls. Debutant Carberry out-scored Cook early on, but fell on 30 going for an ambitious sweep against Mahmudullah. His wicket brought in Jonathan Trott who scored slowly but confidently until he was wrongly dismissed on 39. A bouncing ball hit his helmet and was caught by wicket-keeper Rahim, prompting the umpire to give him out caught. Pietersen, who had been struggling against left-arm spin bowling, adjusted his style of play during his innings, staying more leg-side of the ball. He scored 99 runs, falling just short of a century when he was bowled by left-arm spinner Razzak. Collingwood, who scored 145 runs, and Ian Bell, who added 84 runs, increased the run rate during the second day to propel England to 599 for 6, at which point they declared, half an hour before the tea interval.\nEngland took advantage of bowling at their hosts before tea, with Broad dismissing Kayes and Siddique with bouncers. Shortly after the break, Swann claimed the wicket of Aftab Ahmed in his first over; caught at short leg. Bangladesh had lost three wickets with only 51 runs scored, but a partnership of 94 by Iqbal and Mahmudullah brought their side back into the match. Mahmudullah was caught in the slips just after reaching his half-century, and his captain Shakib Al Hasan followed before the end of the day. Iqbal was dismissed in the third over of the following day, and nine overs later Shahadat Hossain was also dismissed, leaving Bangladesh 416 runs behind with only three wickets remaining. Thoughts of a quick victory were quashed by a Bangladesh record partnership for the eighth-wicket by Rahim and Naeem Islam, who added 113 runs together. Rahim played defiantly, batting for 152 balls to reach score his 79 runs, and was described by \"ESPNcricinfo\"s Andrew McGlashan as a \"lesson to the more impetuous of his team-mates\". The partnership was eventually broken by a run out by Carberry, and Bangladesh added no more runs for the final two wickets to finish on 296: over 300 runs behind.\nAs they were playing a four-man bowling attack, and had spent longer in the field than they had wanted, England opted not to enforce the follow-on. Batting again, England pressed to score quickly, but were pegged back by regular dismissals: no batsman scored more than 40 runs, and the run rate was much the same as their first innings. Shakib Al Hasan claimed four wickets, and England batting 50 minutes into the fourth morning before declaring on 209 for 7, leaving Bangladesh requiring 513 runs in their second innings to win.\nBangladesh lost wickets at regular intervals at the start of their innings; by the end of the 38th over, they had lost five wickets. Rahim joined Siddique after the fifth wicket fell, and the pair batted patiently together to see their side through to force the match into its final day. The partnership continued to battle during the fifth morning of the match, and Siddique reached his first Test century, coming from 262 deliveries. Shortly after, Prior failed to take a difficult catch, but Siddique did not capitalise on the mistake, adding no more runs before he was caught in the slips shortly after lunch. The bowler, Swann, swore at Siddique as he walked off the pitch, something he later apologised for, saying that it was \"a testament to him that he did get everyone frustrated.\" Rahim was bowled by Swann four overs later, and despite a late assault by Naeem Islam, who scored three fours and three sixes before being becoming Swann's 10th victim of the match, England won by 181 runs. Swann, who took five wickets in each innings, was the first English off spinner since Jim Laker in 1956 to take 10 wickets in a match. His performance in the match led to him rising to second place in the ICC Test bowling rankings.\n2nd Test.\nThe teams returned to Dhaka for the second Test, and made three changes; Bangladesh selected Shafiul Islam and Jahurul Islam to replace Aftab Ahmed and Shahadat Hossain, while England added a second spinner, with Carberry making way for Tredwell. The toss was once again won by Bangladesh, who opted to bat first. Tamim Iqbal, on his 21st birthday, scored runs with freedom on the first morning, reaching a half-century from 34 balls. He was dropped twice before that, by Collingwood and Cook, but his innings was described by David Hopps in \"Wisden Cricketers' Alamanack\" as \"taking something normally sedate and slightly forbidding, and making it wild and intoxicating.\" Tamim's batting drew interest that he could become the fifth player in Test history to score a century on the first morning, but he was dismissed by Tredwell for 85, attempting a sweep. Swann, who had been particularly expensive against Tamim, took wickets either side of lunch to leave Bangladesh on 167 for 4. Shakib and Mahmudullah steadied the innings, scoring 59 runs together, before both were dismissed in close succession. Another patient partnership between Mushfiqur Rahim and Naeem Islam took Bangladesh past 300 runs. On the second morning, Bangladesh pressed aggressively, particularly through Shafiul Islam, who scored a half-century at just quicker than a run-a-ball. Cook's captaincy was criticised in \"Wisden\", where Hopps claimed that Cook's fields \"defied logic\", while \"ESPNcricinfo\"s Sahil Dutta described his captaincy as \"more robotic than insightful\". Naeem Islam remained 59 not out as Bangladesh were bowled out for 419.\nIn England's response, Shakib opted to use his spinners to minimise scoring opportunities, a tactic which led to Cook's dismissal for 21. His fellow opener, Trott, scored his first run from his 33rd delivery, and continued to bat circumspectly throughout the second day. Pietersen attempted to score more quickly, though it took a bad over from Razzak to allow him to do so. A misjudged shot after leaving his crease resulted in him being caught, and Collingwood followed soon after, leg before wicket from his third delivery. Bell joined Trott in the middle, and the pair added 67 runs together before Trott was dismissed for 64. Prior capitalised on more bad bowling from Razzak to reach his half-century, but fell shortly after, giving Bangladesh hope of a first-innings lead. Bell and Bresnan took England to the brink of a lead, adding 143 runs together, including a century for Bell. It was the first occasion on which Bell had scored a century in Test cricket without a teammate having already done so in the innings, a statistic that had been used to suggest he could not score run in tough conditions. Speaking about his century, Bell alluded to that statistic, stating that he had \"put a few things to bed.\" After his dismissal, Bresnan batted with the tail, taking his score to 91, and England's to 496, a lead of 77 runs. After the third day, Bangladesh's captain, Shakib, criticised the Bangladesh Cricket Board for not paying for the use of the Umpire Decision Review System. He believed that a number of the umpiring decisions had gone against his side, and the technology could have given his side a better chance of their first Test win over England.\nBangladesh's second innings started in similar fashion to their first; they lost the early wicket of Imrul Kayes, and Tamim scored a quick half-century. The latter was dropped three times before being caught by Broad for 52 runs. Junaid and Jahurul both made good starts for Bangladesh, but were out for 34 and 43 respectively, which along with low scores for Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur left Bangladesh on 172 for six at the end of the fourth day. On the final morning, Shakib batted resiliently with the lower-order batsmen and narrowly missed out on a century; he was the last man out, stumped attempting to score a boundary to reach the landmark. His batting had helped establish a 208 run lead for Bangladesh, which resulted in England requiring just under four runs per over to reach the total.\nIn England's chase, Trott was the only batsman dismissed, run out for 19, although replays suggested that it was possibly the wrong decision. Cook scored his second century of the series, and Pietersen finished on 74, scored at just under a run-a-ball. Bangladesh's bowling attack was tired, and rarely threatened England; Pietersen even opted to switch hit some deliveries. In \"Wisden\", Hopps, who had described the second morning as being possibly \"England's lowest point of a long winter\", contrastingly said of the final day; \"England's supremacy had rarely looked so marked.\" Despite England's victory, which maintained their one hundred percent winning record against Bangladesh, Shakib was named as man of the match.\nTour matches.\n50-over tour matches: Bangladesh Cricket Board XI v England XI.\nEngland won both of their one-day warm-up matches against the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI comfortably. In the first match, England batted first and scored 370 runs, during which Kieswetter and Collingwood both posted centuries while scoring quicker than a-run-a-ball. \"ESPNcricinfo\" described Kieswetter's century as ensuring \"he will be making his England debut in the first ODI\". In the next match, which was shortened to 37 overs per side, England bowled first and restricted their hosts to 151 runs. Tredwell bowled particularly economically, allowing just 17 runs from his seven overs. In their response, England reached the winning total with 70 balls to spare. Cook and Prior both scored half-centuries."
